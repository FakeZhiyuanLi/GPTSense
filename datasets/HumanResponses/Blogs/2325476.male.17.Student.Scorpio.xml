      There is one thing that every great tale has in common. Man triumphing over adversity(or woman triumphing over adversity, fuckin feminazis). Keeping that in mind, I invite you to read the following tale.   As Mike crawled down from the attic, he had determined that the box which contained his surfing shoes must be out in the shed. He had to have his surfing shoes seeing as he was going to Los Angeles the next day, and the water on the west coast is always colder than that on the east coast. Mike gathered the supplies which he would need, a flashlight, a box cutter, and the phone in case someone called while he was outside. He donned his long sweats to protect him from nasty insects, and went out the back door. Unfortuately Mike's door takes it up the butt. It's a door that can be opened from the inside without being unlocked. How gay. So, Mike went rummaging through the shed for his surfing shoes, and came up with nothing.  As he returned to the house, the doorknob would not turn. Staying calm, Mike went around to the front door, but alas, it was locked as well. At this point, the enormity of the situation hit him like a wet salmon. His family was out of town for the next week, he was in the middle of packing for his trip, locked out of his house with no keys to anything save the shed. At this point, the average man(or woman, fucking feminazis) would lose his(or her, fucking feminazis) cool, would flip out. Not Mike. Mike kept his cool and went around to the back door to survey his situation. He could potentially break a window with his Mag-Lite, but he didn't really want to do that. The phone couldn't really help him. But there was the knife. Immediately having an idea, Mike went back to the shed to procure a paint scraper, a decently long, very skinny piece of metal. Returning to the house, Mike found what he needed to see. A window where the storm window had been left open, and only the actual window and the screen blocked his path. Using the boxcutter, Mike slashed through the screen. He then jammed the paint scraper up in between the inner and outer part ot the window. Upon getting the scraper in, he began to pound it sideways so as to unlatch the window, which it did. Mike then crawled through the window, back into his house, like the smart motherfucker that he is.

      ok, so at poetry.com(fucking retards) you can submit poetry, and keep some kind of portfolio there or something, maybe win some prize money, i dunno. I never really had any interest in submitting poetry, cause that's not why i write poetry. Anyway, i was really bored earlier (actually i was taking a break from reading Dante's  Inferno , which is an awesome book), and somehow i ended up taking a quiz on my poetry IQ. I scored 9 out of 11, which is totally irrelevant. Anyway, so the twelfth question on the test is to submit a poem, either something you've already written, or write something, and they'll analyze it and mail you the results. It can be any style of poem you wish to write. Here's the part that pisses me off, and the point of this rant. There's a 20 line limit to the poem. WHAT THE FUCK-ITY FUCK!!!???!!!???! How the FUCK do you put a cap on art?! You might as well say "Paint me a picture of anything that you want, but you can only use three colors", or "write a song, but you can only use major chords" ARGH!!! And yes, i'd love to make you think that im only mad because they're putting a limit on art(art = emotion, so therefore they're putting a limit on emotion), and that is 95% of why im mad, but since i dont write anything with a 20 line limit, my poetry isn't worthy of you?! FUCK you!!

      So i found this picture online that looks exactly like my favorite person, and it made me miss her so much more than i already did. Sigh, being back in charlottes cool, but i wish that the people i cared about from VA were here...  "Err ehn uh bla, chuka fooky fun fla, chuka flabel-blably, fladel-bladel, a beee-uh eedle-uhm flanh, chuka flun-blanh blanh Blanh BLAHN, flagun-blabum, fog-a-moo a momma Lucifer!   And the peculiar thing is this my friends, the song we played on that fateful night didn't actually sound anything like this song!  This is just a tribute!!"  So yea, have a good day ppls, i'm gonna go try to find something to occupy my time now that i've finished transcribing that acapella thing(if you listen to it, it's pretty accurate).

      Ya know what i need? I need pictures of cool people. I have a bunch of thumbtacks, and i hang pictures of cool people on my wall as a border around my closet, but upon moving to my new hous, i find that i'm a) several pictures short, and b) interested in getting rid of some of the pics that are up there at the moment. So, if you're cool, remind me to get some pictures of us having fun. :)

      Jazz is awesome. The Glen Miller Orchestra is so great, i love Swing, Swing, Swing. Every time i hear it i wanna get up and dance some funky old jazz dance where i'm all hunched over and throwing my arms and legs out. It's almost enough to make me pick my trumpet up and try to re-learn how to play it.  Maria's birthday is soon, and i'm not sure what to give her. I was thinking about drawing a dolphin(she loves dolphins), but im not talented at all at shading, and i dont have what i need to do a watercolor or some impressionistic thing. I dont just wanna get her something impersonal like a cd or something. Ideas would be appreciated...  gosh, it's taken me like, twenty minutes to write this much, lol. not feelin it tonight. I think im in the mood to write a poem or something, so i'll cya later....

      I've been thinking about it, and there are tons of people i enjoy talking to. And this isn't a slight to the people i dont mention here, if i talk to you any consquential amount, i think you're awesome, but there's only three people i know that can make you feel really good about yourself by just talking to you. I really dont know why, i guess it has something to do with the fact that they always make eye contact, they never have a negative thing to tell you, they're supportive of you no matter what your opinions and ideas are, and are just agreeable people. Maria and Kim in Virginia are two of the people, I just always feel good about myself after talking to them, they're so supportive of me. And here in Charlotte there's Mary Kate. I'll admit i barely even know her, but she's cool and i already consider her a good friend. I dont think it's possible to leave a conversation with her feeling anything but good.  Anyway, yea, i thought i should mention these three of my friends.  You guys rock!! :)

      The Clash are SOOOOO awesome, get something by them NOW! I've been listening to a lot of Clash lately. It's just so musically wonderful, and theres a message in a lot of their stuff. The other thing I suggest you listen to are three Red Hot Chili Peppers B-Sides. Body of Water, Out of Range, and Rivers of Avalon. Oh man, last time i drove to Virginia(which is a 5 hour drive) i listened to those three songs for at least an hour of the time. I've found a lot of songs that have a few lines that describe where I'm at in my life, but I'd never found a song in which EVERY WORD was talking about what i'm feeling until i heard Out of Range. If anyone wants it, just ask me and I can hook you up.   Ok, anyway, so today sucked. I procrastinate so much. I'm like, 8 assignments back in a few of my classes, and it's not a great feeling. I'm about to head out to dinner right now, so I can't really do anything atm, and i know when i get back i won't have the will to do any of it.   I dunno if i should call Will or not. I think he's under the impression that i'm pissed at him, and maybe i am a LITTLE bit, but not much if at all(im really not positive). But I talked to savannah yesterday, and so i figure maybe i should talk to will soon (if you don't know how thats all connected, you're shit outta luck). That situation is so awkward, with both of them, and i really dont wanna deal with it.    Anyway, sorry i couldn't offer any metaphors or imagery today. Pretty much a straight up bitch session, but I guess that's what these are for, isn't it?

      I don't think i've ever felt as miserable as i have for the past few weeks. I'm really not sure how exactly i could explain it, but i'll give it a shot. Humans, by nature, take good things for granted. You never really, truly realize how sweet the air you breathe is until you're being held underwater.   I feel like when i was born i had a blindfold put on me before i ever had the chance to open my eyes, and therefore I grew up not even knowing what sight was. And then the blindfold was taken off, and I was granted time to use my eyes, and explore this strange new thing that I loved SOOOO much. And what did I do? Nothing. I took it for granted, and put off until tomorrow what I should do today. It wasn't until i found out that i was going to have to wear the blindfold again that i grasped what a gift i had been given, and how i had pissed it away, and now here i sit, wearing my blindfold, trying to remember fuzzy images that used to be clear.   Anyway, yea, don't take things for granted, make the most of everything you can while it's still good.

      Ok, i guess i'll skip the few weeks preamble and get straight to the point. I'm a big believer in that 99% of truth is subjective. Whats true for me isn't necessarily true for you, and vice versa. That being said, I also think that there are some universal truths out there. Example you ask? Don't meddle in other people's shit. In fact, don't do something that could inadvertantly impact someone else's life in a negative way, even if you technically "weren't at fault". If its not your business, dont bring it up, dont talk about it, dont joke about it, and sure as hell don't do something thats gonna impact a situation.

      God-damnit! Everytime i make a friendly offer it backfires right in my face. Someone, lets just call her C, gave me her SN back before i moved to wisconsin. Well I never ever delete anyone off my buddy list (well, one person). So I'm just randomly checking people's profiles and the like, and i come across C's. Well her away message says she's sick, and that her parents went out to dinner and left her no food or money. I leave her a message, semi-serious, semi-joking, telling her that if she's hungry, I'd bring her something to eat. Wouldn't ya fucking know it, she didn't have me on her buddy list or have any idea who i was. So i'm there trying to explain that she gave me her SN a whle back, and i just dont delete anyone, and whatever. Now the internet doesn't allow for me to make inferences from body language, tone of voice, eye contact, etc., but i think it's pretty safe to say she kinda felt like i was stalking her. And thats all i fuckin need, another girl thinking i'm stalking her!  *sigh* :(

      just an added note, a week from tomorrow I get to go to LA for thanksgiving. My cousin lives out there, and he's got a lot of chick friends, and we're gonna go to a lot of parties, and do thanksgiving dinner, etc. At this point in time though, I'd probably give up that whole trip just to spend a day with Kim or Maria(stated alphebetically, not necessarily by importance)...

      Ok, this sorta got me worked up. Someone was talking about grouping music, and believed it to be a good thing. "Humans are organized by nature, we fight entropy" was his argument. Well, ok, sometimes it's good to be organized, but not with music. I mean, how do you objectify the subjective without being overly general and taking away from the uniqueness of the music? I'm sure that there are several people out there that typically listen to lighter stuff that would love the song Nothing Else Matters, but haven't ever been exposed to it because Metallica is labeled as a "rock" or "metal" group. If we didn't pre-occupy ourselves with what kind of music a band played, and listened to the band, we'd have a much higher tolerance for different types of music, and have much better exposure to different styles of music. Now granted, I'm a huge music buff, but I think this idea is pretty universal.

      Ya know what i hate? I hate people striving to be politically correct. Retard, Gay, Fag, Homo, all these words that convey ideas in our colloquial, are words that people take offense to. Then theres the whole list of explicitaves that people take offense to, Shit, Bitch, Fuck, etc.  Words represent ideas. They aren't constants, they dont have a mass, they aren't tangible. They are variables in the most algebriac form of the word. They can't be seen, you cant hold one, they are a manifestation of an idea, designed in such a way as to relate that idea to someone else. That being said, i'd like to point out that there are many things people should take offense to. If someone runs over your mailbox, you should take offense. If someone hits you, you should take offense. But it is PITIFUL, allow me to repeat myself, PITIFUL, to take offense to someone's ideas. "Oh my god! You had a thought, something that is in its nature completely uncontrolable, and often times a product of your upbringing, and i dont like it! In fact, I'm hurt!" I heard someone say that they were offended to hear someone call another person a retard because they had a relative with a mental disability. WHAT THE FUCK?! Someone is an egomaniac. Look, you're not special, we didn't even know you had a mentally disabled relative, and we're not slighting them, because they are the LAST thing on our minds when we call someone a retard! Ok, so what's my point? People who take offense to ideas are fucking retarded homos.

      Well, I finally made a blog, go me!!! Moment of Clarity... well, i never used to use my head. I'd never think about why i felt the way i did, and why i did the things i did. I try my hardest to now, but after 15 years of habit, it's not the easiest thing ever. So here you can expect some rants of what I believe in, some of me analyzing why i feel the way i do, maybe some jokes and cool links, i dunno. Hope you enjoy...

      Have you seen Old School? Remember the part where Frank is debating against "The Ragin' Cajun"? Yea? Sweet!  Ok, now go read JD's blog(link on the right), and read the bolded part. I can SO see JD's actions after finishing that being the same as Franks after finishing his debate. "What just happened? Where am I?"  Anyway, JD did say some VERY insightful stuff there. Everything he said was right, but I don't think he quite got it all. And i can't say I blame him for missing some of it, because it's a tough thing to take seriously.   "The moment you stop believing in a system of cool vs. uncool, popular vs. unpopular and BE YOURSELF, your teen angst will be instantly cut in half (the other half being that of school, sex, and drugs). What I admire in a person and look for in a friend, as do most content young adults, is a confident and unique individual. What I don't like is a person who's always trying to fit in. Desparation, my good friends, is a turn off. Be confident, be an individual, and be alive."  Now, let me revise this a little and apply to more general things...   The moment you stop  believing  is the moment you see things as they are. The moment you can drop your preconcieved notions, and accept things for what they are, is the moment your angst will be gone. The moment you stop  believing  and start   discovering   is the moment you become and individual, and the moment you begin to learn who  you  are. And only when you know who  you  are, can you   discover   who other people are.   Like I said, that's probably not something many of you will be able to accept. And yes, truth is 99% subjective, but you must discover your truths, you can't go around your whole life beLIEving things and live well.

      So, Operation Dumbass 2 is in effect. Operation Dumbass 1 was a horrible failure that fell apart before it was ever launched. Operation Dumbass 1(for purposes of ease, "Plan D") is still highly classified, so I can't really discuss what happened, but if you're in on that loop, then you'll have some idea of whats goin on. I'm still a little freaked after the catastrophe that was Plan D, but Plan D2 is in a different city, with different people, so maybe it'll go differently.   Anyway... you prolly think im crazy now. Or a dumbass. Prolly justified...  So exams haven't gone near as bad as i thought they would, but i have math and physics next, and i'm freaking out, man. Like, im freaked to the point that i just wanna go up and hug someone and whimper.  Sorry, don't have a whole lot to post. Between exams, Operation Dumbass 2, and hackey-sack, i've not had any time to do anything or think anything, and as Plan D2 is top-level classification, and exams and hackey-sack aren't much to talk about, you're just SOL.

      "You're all I've ever wanted, but I'm terrified of you. My castle may be haunted, but I'm terrified of you...(edit out a few lines)  I wait my whole life, to bite the right one, then you come along, and that freaks me out, so I'm frightened... Dracula's Wedding."  I know, I haven't posted lately. I apologize. I dunno... I somehow feel like I've strayed from my mission statement. I've said a lot of meaningless shit, and not been at all insightful. So maybe I'll try and rectify that. I really feel the need right now, more than ever in my life so far, to have some kind of significant other(meaning a girlfriend, heh). In keeping with the idea i based my blog on, I guess I oughta try and figure that out...  -- 10 to 20 mins later--  OK, so all i can think of are trite things.  "I'm just coming out of my shell.", "I'm tired of being alone so much of the time", etc.  And I dunno, maybe it really is one of those things. It wouldn't become cliche if it was never true. But maybe it's something weirder. Maybe since I've had so little interaction with my mom(by comparison to most ppl), I'm feeling the need to have a prominent female figure in my life. This one might take a while to get to the bottom of.   Well, anyway, I think I'm gonna call it quits for tonights blog.  Oh, BTW, Tim, you're the man for taking that rotating cursor thing off. I didn't intend to make anyone change their stuff, but it didn't go unnoticed, and i do appreciate it. :)  Aight, latas.

      I got my cell phone! Woohoo!!! It's so harcore. I won't go into describing it here, but man is it cool.  Well, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get up to Virginia this weekend, so i guess i'll have to make alternate plans. They're gettin snow, which means i'll not be allowed to make the drive.  SORRY MARIA, I REALLY TRULY AM SORRY. :(  In other news, our cult has a new member(well, i dunno if you could really use the term member, ;) )... her name is Vagina, Gina V for short. So our list of members is up to Me (The Eggman), The Walrus, Poop, Big Sexy, Epsilon, Booger, Gina V, and Tinklebell. Pretty soon we will obtain world domination.  So yea, i have a lot to say right now, but im too tired to think of the right words. i'll give it a shot tomorrow. Anyway, good night, sleep well, sweet dreams, and ---    realization  . i've had a lot of new friends over the past few years, but i still haven't learned how to act around people. I still have this complex where i'm kidna shy and can't just act normally around someone i like, and then they never get to know me, and in turn won't ever be able to feel the same way about me that i do about them.   *sigh*  i gotta get some help with that.  aight peace...

      GODDAMNIT i hate it when people put little rotating icon bullshit around the fucking cursor on their websties.  i must be ADD or something, cause i can't ignore it, and it's fucking irritating.  ugh...  Anyway, here's the line you've all been waiting for. It's now official,   Mike Garvey is in the market for a chick.    . . .  Hehe, I love pretending to be egotistical from time to time. Yea... "Do you need anybody? I just need someone to love. Could it be anybody? I want somebody to love."  Can't express it any better than that. I've just finally tapped into a love for other people that was buried beneath my fucked-up emotional shell, and i need someone to share that with...   In other news, I'm getting a cell phone tomorrow finally. Only 2 months after the promised date... figures.  Ok, i'm gonna go do soemthing else right now.  cy'all later.

      HAPPY BIRTHDAY MARIA!!! I know you don't read this, but im thinkin of ya. :)    "There's all this talk about Santa Claus, but see, LOVE will rule supreme!!!! Happy Valentines Day..."   I love Outkast, or more specifically Andre3000, his messages are often so wonderful, and the mixture of hip-hop, and jazz, maybe a little pop, funk, and rock is just glorious.   "... and if you do not know me then how could you be my friend?"  As introverted as I am, people are awesome. I mean, I love my alone time, I love being introspective and trying to figure out who i am, or why i feel like i do, but a) i can't really get to the bottom of any of that without interacting with people, and b) things just tend to be so much more exciting and enjoyable when in the company of friends. I need to start hanging out with some more cool people.   I'm going up to VA this weekend, which is gonna be awesome, as per usual. Unfortunately i can't leave until saturday because of track(fuck track!!). which gives me 5 hours of driving on saturday, and 5 more on sunday. I gotta say if it wasn't Maria's birthday i'd wait for a better weekend, but it's kinda important to me to hang with her, so i'll be able to do it. I might try nd catch up with kim as well, i dunno. I can't ever get in touch with her, so i worry that she just doesn't want anything to do with me. But i can't tell if im just being insecure or not. *shrug*   Anyway, I'm out like a fetus.  "There's so much fuss about Santa Claus, but Cupid will NOT be defeated!!!!"

      Ok, so, very first thing I'm gonna say before anything else. If parts of this make no sense, i apologize. I haven't had any real sleep in the past 36 hours or so, so im bound to fuck up.  Ok, that being said, I had an incredible experience on the last night of my LA trip. First thing that hit me is that if you're willing to find a place,(and pay a fucking 20 dollar cover charge, which still blows my mind) there are places where you can do   whatever   your morals will let you get away with... to 15 year old girls. Needless to say i wasn't exactly in on the whole 15 year old softcore porn fest(i have a hard time forgiving myself if i call a friend after they've gone to sleep, so my morals dont leave much room for porking pre-pubescent girls). So yea, I'm at club One Seven(they dont let you call it Seventeen, lol) the other day... last night? I dunno my sense of time is fucked, and the 3 hour time difference dont help. Ok, so i get to club one seven maybe... 25 hours ago from right now, and i can tell rigth away it's not my scene. If you know me, you know I'm not the world's most extroverted person. So i'm pretty much chillin on the couches with my cousin. We see, for several hours, this one girl thats no more than 15 years old. She's wearing knee high black leather boots, fishnet stockings, a miniskirt that's maybe... 6 inches long, 7 at the most, and a spaghetti strap shirt that shows her sparkley black bra off. So at first shes just dancing around alone, and everytime she goes down everyone can see her panties, which is kinda sick considering she's early 15 year old. Anyway, after an hour or so, this guy that looked older than me comes up and starts freaking with her, which in itself isn't so bad. then, after a little more time, this guy she's dancing with, that she's obviously  JUST   met starts rubbing his hands all over her crotch(or, if you're grant, then all over her groin ;) )! I mean, some of the stuff this girl and guy were doing could be considered softcore porn. The other thing that struck me about the club, is how sad it is that a lot of the kids here are trying to find meaning in that kind of stuff. I mean, far be it from me to tell ppl what they should do with their lives, but i think it's kind of sad that people are trying to find meaning in pseudo-sex(well, maybe not pseudo) with strangers. I dunno, maybe there's nothing wrong with that, but it strikes me as more of a problem than consumerism.   In fact. I love consumerism, i love capitalism, i love stores ripping people off to provide me products that i enjoy, and dont really need. I realized that as I was playing the Gamecube i bought on friday. I was halfway thinking of participating in buy nothing day, but the Gamecube came with 4 of the 6 Zelda games, including the two original NES games, unaltered. As it stands theres an upper, middle, and lower class. If it weren't for people buying shit and driving our economy, there'd just be a lower class. Quick question, which is the lesser of two evils, some people being poor, or all people being poor?   Wow, WHY THE FUCK AM I AWAKE?!!?!?!?! I'm gonna go get my 6 hours of sleep for tomorrow. I'm gonna be dead at track practice...

      So yea, Moment of Clarity is officially closed.  I have a word document of everything I wrote here, in the REALLY weird event that someone would like a copy of what I said. And now I leave you with this crafty drawing of a penis.    \///// \\/////// \\\\/////// \\\\\\\///////&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\     \\\\\\\\\\////-----------------------------------------------------------&nbsp;&nbsp;\  \\\///&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;________ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{&nbsp;-- splooge! ) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|---------------------------------------------------&nbsp;&nbsp;/ |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ (&nbsp;&nbsp;\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)   &nbsp;(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)&nbsp; /(&nbsp;\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)\                                                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(___/ \___)     urlLink Guestbook

      Eh, I had some thoughtful shit to post, but I suddenly and mysteriously don't feel like posting it. I'm prolly gonna get rid of this blog at some point soon. My mind is drifting in a direction where I can't say, even here, what I want because it may ruin friendships or impact ppl, in a less than positiveway, who may or may not read this. So, if this turns out to be my last entry, then it's been fun, and I bid you farewell. If it's not, then I hope you enjoy my next post.

      I had something REALLY thoughtful to say that I'd thought of today, furthering the points i made below, but i forgot what it was. *shrug*  So it turns out the scarf i was crocheting was retarted, stitches were far too tight, and the edges were bad.   Thats about it really. I leave you with this...  SAtotallyNE: ever heard the song Owner of a lonely heart by Yes? wmporsche311: i think they issued it to everyone in the suburbs

      Not feelin too thoughtful today. Im definately on an upswing atm tho. I'm gonna be the kicker/punter for the football team next year, which is exciting. Things have just been going my way lately, which is great. In fact the only way things could get better is if... well, JD and Martha know the answer to that. :)   Aight, later.

      Ok, normally I dislike blog posts being in response to one another, like a message board is, but I gotta do this one. This is in response to  urlLink Brian's  last post on January 6th.  Everything comes from the mind. Individuality is nothing more than the result of introspection. The "need" to display your individuality with useless items goes back to the void humans feel that I spoke of earlier. A true individual has come to terms, through introspection, with his gifts, and his shortcomings, and is content with who he is. Someone who feels the need to display their "individuality" to others via useless items is not an individual, as they need re-affirmation from others because they haven't come to terms with their faults.   Secondly, and this is probably a bold statement, but it looks as if you(Brian) would put misguided attempts to achieve human satisfaction over the good of our world. This is a perfect example of the human superiority complex I spoke of. The desire to create and destroy. The desire for the feeling of power, as false as the power may be. Following useless rituals created by humans to perpetuate the use of useless items never leads to contentment. It leads to stress, anger, fear, and a whole other load of negative emotions. If that brings contentment than our society is very masochistic, which would be ironic, seeing as masochism, socially speaking, is infinitely more taboo than homosexuality, which is denounced in the BIBLE.   Contentment is when you realize, there are planets, stars, living creatures I will never know of. There are people on this planet I will never meet. My actions will never affect them. Time is never ending, the amount I've been allotted is smaller than anything that has ever been discovered. My actions are less than trivial. I am no more important, and no less important than any other human alive. We are all insignificant. And since, in the end, our actions couldn't matter less, we should have a good time, and enjoy each others company, but not at the cost of our individuality.  The human lust for power, through whatever turns it has taken, whatever intentions there were along the path, has gotten us to this point. Humans did not create this planet, and to compensate for the feelings of inadequacy that brings, we make damn sure we have the power to destroy it. If I can not create, I will destroy.   Finally, I'm just going to assume you were playing devil's advocate for the part about me being apathetic. You are the one who said that you were happy to see minorities step up and take more control and power amd get more justice in the world, but not at your expense. Here's a little quote for ya,   "God give me the serenity to accept things which cannot be changed; Give me courage to change things which must be changed; And the wisdom to distinguish one from the other"   Yup, the serenity prayer. Millions of people are starving in Africa. You're much more of a realist than I will ever be, is that a thing you cannot change, or a thing you can? Maybe you could help feed a few hundred, but that pretty much qualifies as something you can not change. The fact of the matter is, as you so succinctly put it, it's not my problem. Were I in a similar situation, I would not be expecting the aid of other people. It's not their problem. There's something to be said for altruism, there really is, and hell, I can respect martyrdom to a certain point, but in order to be an individual, which you so stressed the importance of, you must find a healthy balance between caring for yourself, and caring for others. If you never take the time to be introspective, how can you expect to learn anything about yourself?

      And one more just because I dont wanna goto bed  I made a New Year's Resolution this year, which I never do. I am going to consciously fuck up a lot this year. Now I dont mean that I'm gonna start doin drugs or some shit like that. I'm going to start doing things on a whim, and do things that may not be fucking up, but things i never would've had the gall to do before.  I am a teenager. That means that I get a lot of things. Angst, insecurity, lots of hair, and most importantly, the chance to fuck up. This is it, these are the years of my life where I can screw things up, and recover perfectly. These are the years that I'm supposed to be misguided, idiotic, brash, and inept, and learn from it, and damnit, thats what I intend to do.  And that, my friends, is why i'm looking forward to going back to school in 7-8 hours.

      The internet is truly worthless. I was thinking about how I often turn to the internet to alleviate my boredom, and it never helps. Then I realized, that the internet has nothing of value. You can use it to buy more stuff to fill some void in your life, you can use it to learn about the latest breaking events that don't affect you at all... you can use it to fulfill your lustiest fantasies, but in all, the internet is truly worthless.     It is an invention of man that has no immediate purpose, and as such, man feels the need to try and make a purpose for it.    Then it hit me... how incredibly fucking much of the state of all human affairs in the world would fall into that category? The stock exchange, politics, television, all useless entities made and used to perpetuate the use of other useless entities. (ugh, my ideas on the matter are now coming into my head so fast that I'm having trouble forming them into sentences before they're gone and new ones are there) I am thoroughly convinced that the end of our world will be brought about in no small part by said entities.   Why are there atomic bombs? To kill our enemies. Why do we have enemies? Because they have different ideas and opinions than us. Why do we need ideas and opinions?  If not for the formation of economies and governments, the US wouldn't be anti-communist, there would've been no cold war, no arms race, obtaining nuclear weapons wouldn't be a priority- no, a prerequisite to being a world power, and the name Kim Jong Il wouldn't be of any concern to anyone. Communication and interaction are of the utmost importance... in SMALL communities. Has anyone ever stopped to think maybe there's such a thing as too much interaction? First, why should we worry about the lives of people we will never meet, and second, why should we try and exert some kind of power over them?  What's the big deal about Korea? They're communists with nukes. So? So their method of existence affects the international system or trading useless entities created by man for the sole purpose of furthering the use of other useless entities.   Enough to make your head spin, no?  So why does man feel the need to create these kinds of things? Probably to fill some kind of void. I personally would say that humans are frightened of not being able to create and destroy, of not having something for which they can be the alpha and the omega. We have a superiority complex, and feel a void that we try to assuage by creating the illusion of power. In truth, that void is filled by surrendering our notions of power, and succumbing to the cosmic greatness of what is and what's to be. For all us human beings in the world, there sure aren't many of us who see the beauty and find the vast serenity and contentment that exists in  simply being .

      Well, the dance was fun last night. But then the first thing i got today was one of my gramps' subtle insults, grrrrr. Then i did laundry all day cause everyone who was like, "oh yah, we'll be there saturday afternoon," never showed up. But I guess thats cool because then a friend that was supposed to call me about seeing a movie never did, and I just happened to not at all be able to get in touch with her. But just so long as no one else was inconvenienced and everyone else was happy then I guess it's fine and fucking dandy.  At least someone thinks enough of me to chill with me for an hour.

      Hmm... I think I'll come at ya from left field this time. Here's something that goes against everything I've ever said... but somehow it just sounds right.  Everyone has a purpose in life not decided by themselves. While for 95% that purpose is to find the right person, settle down, have a family, and relish in the greatest joys of being human, there are those for whom that is not their purpose. They have a different purpose, not greater nor lesser, and not at all clear. These people will never find love because it is not meant for them. These people will never settle down, because what drives them is the need to fulfill their purpose. It's likely the these people won't have the fortune of growing old and living out their days, for once their purpose is fulfilled, there is no need for them.   I honestly feel like I'm one of those people. I don't feel a real, true urge to find a significant other, but there's definately something missing. Something that I'm here for... I've always tried to push it away by beLIEving that we determined our own purpose. That's a pleasant idea, but it's not the case. I'm here for a reason. There's someething I'm supposed to do, or witness, or be, and it's not to just settle down and enjoy a family.   Or maybe I'm just afraid of commitment...

      so, im headin to satna monica tomorrow. will be fun.   This year has been the start of my rebellion, of MY revolution (not to be confused with conners revolution, ;) ). This is the year that counts as far as college goes. This is the start of the downward spiral, the "initiation into adulthood" the is a staple of our society. I say fuck that. Look, I'm not gonna lie to myself, I'm not going to have many, if any, allies in this. From here until I die, my contemporaries will continue to assume more responsibilty, become dryer and dryer people, eventually end up shuffling papers in some high paying corporate job. Fuck that. I will always refuse responsibility. We were born free of it because thats how we were meant to be. I refuse to put human emotion, human desire, in the backseat to what's the "right" thing to do. There is no RIGHT thing to do except what you dictate is right for yourself! Yes, I realize that one by one my friends will become my enemies because of this. Regardless of what you may say to me, you will eventually dislike my company bexause of how "childish" or "selfish" you will find me. Yes, I realize that this line of thought prevents money, or respect, but it's how i feel damnit. I will not... no, I can not become a 30 or 40 something year old who cares more about stupid fucking tasks or figures than about following my curiosity, appeasing the thirst for what I wish to learn or do. I've always had a deep gut feeling that I'm not meant to ever find someone to have a relationship with. I think this is probably why.  In summary: - 99% of you will eventually bend to society's will, I will not. - You will find me to be childish, selfish, uncouth. - I don't give a fuck.  Respectfully your enemy, Mike Garvey

      Woohoo!!!! Spring break, bitch!  Taking a momentary break from building my Samurai Armor. This is so friggin intricate (maybe a little on the tedious side, but well worth it) and I'm the one who made up the blueprints!!! Anyway, I've been working for a total of about 3-4 hours, and I'm maybe halfway done with the framework for the torso. Not counting the sleeves of course. I see myself finishing the framework for the whole getup tomorrow with the guys, then putting the scales on on Sunday. It's gonna be badassedness to the tenth degree.

      Yea, ok. So it's open again. But don't tell anyone. If you were special enough to come here, then you know that I'll be posting, but don't tell anyone else. make them come here of their own accord. thanks, you rock.  So, earlier I decided that there's nothing for me here in charlotte. A little later me di cuenta(i realized) that that wasn't exactly true. I'm meeting a guy that writes music for movies and has his own studio and can help me out with that stuff on tuesday, and I'm prolly gonna be getting a personal trainer for kicking who is John Kasay's personal trainer. So I am getting some neat opportunities here.    -- BUT --   I can't really say I'm that happy here. I've all but lost all contact I ever had with any of my Virginia friends, with the possible exception of Sujay. Those were the people I identified with more than anyone else in my life. Sure, I have friends here, and bear in mind for this that they are great, excellent people, and I mean them no slight, and my life would be total and utter shit without them, but I feel like I need to be elsewhere, doing different things. I can't be happy in this city, at this school. There is nothing about the girls here that would make me interested in a relationship, therre's maybe 3-4 guys I enjoy hanging out with, and I dunno how many of them I'd call real friends, and about the only things I can do for fun are play my guitar and program on my computer. I have a lot of love and compassion to give, I just don't have anyone to give it to... I feel like I need to go somewhere, make a fresh start, like I did in VA. That's why I can't wait to move to CA. It's so far from here physically, mentally, and socially, that I just feel like I would be in my element out there.  Of course I could just be in a mood of self-pity...

      So i'm not gonna be posting again anytime soon. I'm getting my cable modem taken away and being forced to use AOL. Lots of shit is going on in my life right now. I won't go into here, but you can ask me if you want, tho there is one thing i have to say. And don't freak out when you read it, I'm trying to get in contact with Dr. Rex and Mrs. Young and whoever else i can, so i'm taking the appropriate measures.  I don't want to live anymore. I've reached a point where life is not worth living. It simply isn't, no matter how sacred other people may feel it is(which is an opinion i do NOT share) I just don't want to exist. I'd take absolute nothingness, or maybe even what dante described as the punishment in hell for suicides over life at this point.  I need hugs, lots of them.

      The tables are empty the dance floor's deserted. You play the same love song, it's the 10th time you've heard it. That's the beginning, just one of the clues. You've had your first leson, in learning the blues.  The cigarettes you light, one after another, won't help you forget her, and the way that you love her. You're only burning, a torch you can't lose. But you're on the right track, for learning the blues.  When you're at home alone, the blues will taunt you constantly. When you're out in a crowd, the blues will haunt your memory.  The nights that you don't sleep, that whole night you're crying. But you can't forget her, soon you even stop trying. You'll walk that floor, and wear out your shoes. When you feel your heart break, You're learning the blues.

      *RATED M, FOR MELANCHOLY*  sorry for the lack of postage.  not much about which to speak. Been sick, can't really talk so much as wheeze in a semi-intelligible manner.  Prolly not goin to CCDS prom. *shrug* whoop-de-doo...  Grades are bad, tho i can't say i care enough to jump on fixing that.  But at least i've always got my... hmm... can't think of anything.   yea, that sounds about right.    nothing has any feeling anymore. nothing really excites me, nothing really enrages me. I don't really wish or hope for anything. Ic an't tell you ifone thing tastes "better" than another, just that they both have a taste. I feel like I'm not alive. I don't even feel like I'm dreaming. I feel like I'm watching someone else's life play out...  I've felt this way my whole life more or less. 'Cept a few months in Virginia. And it's not that I'm not surrounded by cool people, because I am, I just don't feel alive.

      The funny thing is you probably don't even realize that you're all I think about. Elton said it best...   "It's a little bit funny this feeling inside I'm not one of those who can easily hide I don't have much money but boy if I did I'd buy a big house where we both could live  If I was a sculptor, but then again, no Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show I know it's not much but it's the best I can do My gift is my song and this one's for you  And you can tell everybody this is your song It may be quite simple but now that it's done I hope you don't mind I hope you don't mind that I put down in words How wonderful life is while you're in the world  I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song It's for people like you that keep it turned on  So excuse me forgetting but these things I do You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue Anyway the thing is what I really mean Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen  And you can tell everybody this is your song It may be quite simple but now that it's done I hope you don't mind I hope you don't mind that I put down in words How wonderful life is while you're in the world"

      RIKA MURANAKA IS MY GOD!!!!!!!! &nbsp; Well, i prolly wouldn't go that far, but I really like her music. Especially  The Best Is Yet To Come (hmmm... as per the title), BWAGH! So, umm.... yea, go listen to Rika Muranaka. Oh, and you should check out the OCRemix from one of her songs that (her song was used as the ending theme for Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty) which can be found here:  urlLink http://www.ocremix.org/detailmix.php?mixid=OCR00945 . This is a remix of  Can't Say Goodbye To Yesterday , which is&nbsp;another great tune.  &nbsp; Anyway, in recent news, I had a lovely chat with Miss Mary Kate Walthizzall the other day at the Fairibou. It&nbsp;finally sunk in that she (and many others) is leaving soon. :( Makes me so sad. Then I was meeting Sturge for lunch at Salsaritas today, and who did we run into but Sally, Kaitlyn, and Rachel. So we joined forces and formed a band the likes of which have NEVER been seen!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh wait, wrong thing... but yeah, we did join forces, and had a big lunch/convo. Well, enough excitement for a few days. Back to my hermitage. :)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peace! &nbsp; &nbsp; . . . &nbsp; &nbsp; LISTEN TO RIKA MURANAKA!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... bitches, lol.

      So utterly bored. There's nothing interesting to do. At all, in any aspect of life. The only people i want to talk to i can't at the moment. Well, either i can't or they always leave right when i start talking to them. :(   it must seem like I'm just indredibly whiny and depressed. maybe a little truth to that, heh. but i am happy when im actually around other people. most of the time. heh

      Watashi no katana nagakute kidedu. Watashi wa samurai. Hai!!   I really need a girlfriend. *sigh* I need someone that i can hug, and talk to, and be utterly close to. That and I need to finally be out and on my own. I'm too much of a recluse for parents and/or family. That's why I'm not appealing to ppl. I'm a fucking hermit, lol.   Yodobunun mashigeh sengyutda, bitches!!! (no idea of how to "properly" translate korean characters to english letters, so that my best phoenetic approximation)
