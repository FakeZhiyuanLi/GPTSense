       Sleeping until noon owns!, the phone rang like 10 timez, and my cell rang 5, but o well, thats what voicemail is for.  Today is my last day of freedom before summer school starts tomorrow *Shakes Fist*, I really do hate my math teacher, giving me a goddman 69 in Pure 20, but then again, its hard to learn when the teacher isn't even positive about the material in the course.  As for what I'm doing today, not a hell of alot, got to finish up configuring and installing the rest of the software on a computer I built for a Client, after I do that, probably not a hell of alot, seeing how its my last day of total freedom for all of July.

       Well, I was officially discharged and released from John G. Diefenbaker High, and accepted to Bowness High for Gr. 12.  I really hate how long it takes the CBE to get paperwork done, I handed in my transfer forms in triplicat :P 4 weeks ago, and they just got it done.  It took them 2 months for me to get my CBE Employee ID number :P, o well, what can ya do.  Right now, im off to Boston Pizza to eat my heart out :D  TTY all later  Eric

       Well, what an election, looks like we have a Liberal Minority government for the next little while (I personally don't think it will last longer than 18-24 months, then another election, I forsee a Vote of No Confidence).  I'm not super political, but I do have views on it, I was rooting for the Conservatives, we need a change from the Liberals in this country, and I think the Conservatives could have made that happen.  One thing is for sure though, Paul Martin is going to have one hell of a time trying to pass bills with a minority government. It seems like a small number, but the liberals only have 7.2% (or something close to that) more seats than the conservatives.  Just my $0.02 for the election.  As for what im doing today?, I still have to find something to do, and close, cause I don't have a vehicle today :@.  Maybe i'll try to see if Marci is in town, go for coffee or something, even though I've never driven with her :S:|, lol.  Who knows what I'll do today, gonna have to see.  BTW Corey, good idea for the daily links on ur Blog, haha, there good, especially the HP recall one (thats gonna cost a fortune :S).  I'll probably post later if nothings going on :P.

       Well, how to start, my night started off semi-okay, except Staci forgot we were hanging out I think, LOL, but thats oki.  I had to babysit my Aunt's dog, who is cute, but a PAIN IN THE ASS! to take care of, what high needs :P.  Phil came over later, played 'XIII', which actually is a surprisingly good game with a great story line to it.  As for tomorrow?!, we'll see how the day unfolds, my bro and dad are going golfing with the principal from my dad's school, and my moms @ work, so we'll see what I'll find to do.  Nite all!

       WOW!, here I am thinking that I would have a nice sleep and be able to sleep in...WRONG!, my dad wakes me up at 8! in the morning :@, and asks me to drive him to work...so I did, but under protest.  As for the rest, I had to go to school to get my report card (shitty, but o well), and was surprised to see that I got recommended for ELA 30-1 (YAY!) which means I officially got into all the academic courses for Gr. 12., and after that went with Phil to pick up his dog from somewhere, lol.  What am I doing for the rest of the day?, well going to chill with Staci and fix her computer and then work on her blogger page, so that should be lots of fun.  Eric

       Well, I actually got to sleep in today, WOOHOO!, didn't get up until 11ish.  I went to see my grandma at the hospital today, which was nice :), she was really happy to see me, and I was happy to see her too.  I was glad to see her getting good care and treatment too.  As for the rest of the day, went to hang out with my friend Lyndsey, who I haven't seen in a while, so that was kool, watched 50 first dates (FUNNY!).  And now, I plan just to chill out, do whatever, might work on my page a little bit with XML, but im feeling really lazy tonite.  Nite all!  Eric

       Well, the computer took 3 hours, not bad, but formatting a 120 GB hard drive as NTFS took forever, luckily I had my old Dell laptop there, so at least I could listen to some music.  Installing Windows XP Pro went smooth, or as smooth as a Windows XP installation can go.  The good news!, I have the rest of the night off to do whatever the hell I feel like, which will probably be nothing, but o well.  I made $60, which should last me the next few dayz, or at least I do that big computer job next monday for someone out in Bearspaw.  On the not so bad side of the day, my next door neighbours got a new puppy (well, they've had him for 3 months now), but he is a cutie, and now my dog has a new playmate too.    urlLink       Well, if I don't post anymore for the rest of the nite, nite all!

              I am  a Defender-ship .   I am fiercely protective of my friends and loved ones, and unforgiving of any who would hurt them. Speed and foresight are my strengths, at the cost of a little clumsiness. I'm most comfortable with a few friends, but sometimes particularly enjoy spending time in larger groups.  What Video Game Character Are You?       This is definitly me, I love my friends alot, and they mean the world to me.   I didn't get a chance to see my alternative, but it was probably something weird. And No! Corey, I didn't copy you, I actually did the quiz, LOL!  Eric

       Well, so much for the day off, a few hours after I got off the phone with one client, another calls me up and says "HELP!, MY COMPUTER IS FUCKED", which, if you use ANY version of Windows, minus version 3.1, is common.  This is a good thing in the fact that I guess it gives me something to do for the day, on the down side, its gonna be a bitch of a computer to fix :@, but hey, I like a challenge every so often.  I have to work there at 4 this afternoon, so... 3-4 hrs to fix the computer, so I should be home by 7 or 8, which would be nice, then I have the rest of the night off to do whatever :P.

       Good Morning  Well, got my first phone call of the day at 8:30 (5 hrs sleep) in the friggin' morning, on my home phone no doubt, when I told him to call my cell.  It was my client saying I cannot come and install his new computer until next Monday, cause he forgot he was busy, which sux, cause I was up until 3:30 in the morning configuring Windows XP Pro for him :@. O well, I'm gonna have to wait for money until then, but I should have at least one small computer job I can do until then to get me some money.  Eric

       Well, took my resume to about 3 places today (BestBuy, Futureshop, and Memory Express), so hopefully I will get at least 1 callback.  I really need cash, getting low on the cash flow, but what can ya do?!.  I have to work tomorrow, private client job up in Bearspaw (a little way outta the city), but I should be getting paid (at least $125), so that should last me for a little while longer, gotta save for my laptop too.  Went to Shawn's tonite for a BBQ (Gotta love those!).  Hung out with Shawn and his gf Megan (extremly nice person).  Watched a shit load of Family Guy, a great show to those who don't know about it.  Going home now, still have to finish getting ready for work tonite, still have to install Windows XP Pro SP-1a on 2 computers tonite *BARF*, so im still gonna be up for a while.  Have a good nite all.  Eric

       Well, seeing how I am in Calgary all July for summer school (Goddamn teacher giving me a 69 in Pure 20).  I think im gonna need to find myself a Job.  The Calgary Board of Education has recently passed a By-Law saying no one under the age of 18 may work in the I.T. Department (Stupid Politics :@).  Also, I need money, if I'm gonna get my laptop soon, I'm gonna need some mulah to make it happen, we'll see how the search goes, and i'll post later to let you know what happened.  Eric

       Well, went to stampede yesterday with a friend of mine, had alot of fun.  Pretty much went on every ride, not all of them though, had alot of food, lol, but who doesn't at Stampede.  Caught up with Lyndsey's older sister and her bf, so that was kool.  Jamie tried to get us into see the fireworks show :D, but to no avail, he couldn't get passes >.  As for what im doing today, well, as u can see by the time, I didn't get up until noon, lol, so not much going on today.  I think I have to work later this afternoon, but we'll see as the time goes.  My arms got very sunburned yesterday, and so did my face, so im gonna try to recover from that.  Later,  Eric

       Okay, It's almost been a week, I know, its really sad, but I have been really busy.  Still doing the summer school thing, with a kick ass 90 avg and 3rd place in my class, its goin really well :D.  I was able to help some friends on the weekend, they called me at 3 in the morning, in tears :( and they didn't know what else to do, they were at a party that went bad :(, so I told them to come here and spend the nite, I didn't want them wandering the streets at 3 in the morning.  That night really made me think...I was so glad I could be there for them when they really needed a close friend, someone they could trust, and talk to as well.  That nite however, I didn't sleep, for 1 reason only, I was to glad to see them safe and secure (and I DO NOT! cry that often, but that nite I did).  They felt bad for calling me @ 3 in the morning, but HEY!, if I couldn't have been there for them, what kind of friend would I be?, when I can't even be there for them when they really needed me?  So I am extremly glad that they called, and that they were safe and sound :).  and that I could be there for them when they really needed me.  The three of them mean alot to me, mainly becuase without them, I would not be here at the moment, they mean a great deal to me, and I'm glad that they are safe and everything is okay.  What else is new with me?, not too much, got alot on my mind right now, when I shouldn't.  I'm not stressed about anything, just guess I still got a few things to work through, O well, hopefully everything will work out...right?.  Went for a walk with Lisan last nite, walked on Nose Hill for about 2-3 hours or so, which was incredibly good, she's a good friend, don't really see her as often as I would like though.  O well, enough typing for now, im about to pass out from being tired :P  Post Later  P.S. I promise to keep it updated more often for those who read it, LOL.

       Well, today was my first day , and to tell the truth, it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  I have an excellent teacher that taught math for many many years, so that was good to know :D.  Have no one I know in my class, but what can ya do, got to take the good with the bad I guess.  Hopefully getting 2 things tomorrow, which 1 of them is a for sure, the other is on the bargaining table:  1.) a new LG 8x DVD +/- R/RW Drive for my Mac, and; 2.) a Eye TV USB Remote Edition so I can watch TV on my Mac  I have enough money for both, just want to check up on the Eye TV thing, cause its USB and all.  Hmmm..., what else is new o yea!, MY BROTHER IS GONE FOR AN ENTIRE MONTH :D, HAHA, WOO HOO!.  That's all for now  Eric
