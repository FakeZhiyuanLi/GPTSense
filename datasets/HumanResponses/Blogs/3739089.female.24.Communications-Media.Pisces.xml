       Several weeks in New York, I came to grips with the fact that NOTHING and NO ONE is normal. It dawned on me when I was walking around the city, listening to Lena's story of the "special" black girl in her class who always demands attention.  After some introspections, I remembered myself as the one who wanted absolutely no attention in my class. My second grade teacher once told my parents that I was "eccentric"(that was also how I learned the word)....What really happened was that I was so shocked by everyone else being happy and carefree, which I was just not. Part of me was jealous, a larger part was scared...    However, I learned fast and after some miraculous work, I became more and more popular in school. Kids started to like me and I secretly thought that I'd officially made to the "normal kids" list.  Simply enough, that's what I've been doing for all the past 24 yrs,  trying  hard to be "normal", before this screwed-up world mired into delusions of  "happy",and "normal."  Why are people obsessed with something totally not real? Yes, I am not normal-- I left an abnormal country and landed in another. I am working an abnormal job with abnormal mindset and abnormal schedules, and I enjoy my non-normal friends 100 times better. I know it, I like it, and I don't care.

       Tomorrow, or should I say, today, I shall meet up finally with my Tuesday partner S. We've been talking for a while now about meeting up after I posted for a Tuesday partner. I posted at the end of a mega boring Tuesday a few weeks ago. I am not sure if I was bored because husband's away, friends were working/abroad, or just because the contrast between  that and a working day was too huge to take. Obviously that Tuesday had bored quite a few others including S, whose Tuesdays are wide open due to a recent laid-off, and believes "laughter and a smile are 2 of the most important remedies in life." That positiveness struck me and I took the offer. Meeting people off CL is somewhat comparable to unwrapping a Christmas gift, since you never know what's inside the box, which is also where the excitement lies, I guess. Just a random thought,  "boring" sounds like a ultra "boring" word now, especially since I have been exploiting its use extensively here.:)

       Li Chi, who lived about 1400 yrs ago in Tang Dynasty in China, killed himself by plunging into a toilet (a much older version then would be a whole) He was rescued once, but succeeded at his second attempt. This has been the worst suicides I've ever heard of so far. However, Li Chi wouldn't agree. According to history, what has grossed us out is Li Chi's way of seeking "extrme experiences." I stepped into quite a lot of cow shit once when I was 7 and it was definitely not fun. A friend                                                       who followed me into it was simply crying  her way home.  However, how could someone with passion for life stop wondering about being extreme. What if I shave all my hair? How about skateboading to work(it will take another few years before I am good enough to do that obviously)? and there are many other unexplored pleasures that I want to look into--- as long as they don't kill me,they should make me stronger, and hopefully happier.

       That might be an issue. But it scares me more when I cancled meeting up with you, time after time, because of work, and you did the same thing. Pople need to have time for their friends, especially the ones they love. Here is where you can find me when you can't find me,reach me when I am unreachable, when I am talking but couldn't talk, to all the friends I care truly.

       I was vegetating on a bus, looking smart, of course. A guy who just hopped on woke me up, "hey, how are you?" he started talking. From the smiles on his face, i knew instantly that he is someone from work. I must have talked to him for one of my assignmetns. But damn, who is he? I can't remember. Chase Bank? Hospital? Community Board? The library? Fortunately at that point, i was getting professionally good at talking to poeple in such a way that they would feel I know excatly who they are. And I therefore boldy proceeded with the conversation. me- hey, are you working today? him- yes. (not very helpful) me- thanks a lot for your help last time! him- I should thank you. I got two copies of the paper after it came out (I did a story with you?) me- oh good. keep busy? him- sort of, we get busy when projects are due (IT?) me- so you live in Flushing?  him-right.(then you can't be one of those bankers and lawyers) His stop is coming, and  him- can u give me your card again?  me- of course , yours?(my last chance, man) him- I am sorry I didn't bring mine (hopes evaporated. and what? are you leaving me hanging here? ) I searched, and searched, and my mind was just as blank. mystery unsolved and what's worse,  next time I see him, I will have to remember following facts in order not to look like an idiot: 1.I already "know" him twice 2. I don't really know him. 3. He knows me damn well, although I am not sure what I've told him about myself 4. I already forget what he looks like

       "Cops could be nasty,"-said Henry when I met him for the first time at 109. 109 stands for 109 princenct.Henry is the retired Crime Prevention Officer. I am the brand new police beat reporter from WJ. WJ is a Chinese daily pubished across North America.   There are two kinds of cops in 109- those who love me, and those who love C. C., a woman two years older, is the police beat reporter from the enemey paper-- ST.  The war between WJ and ST has been going on for years. WJ had won most of the battles until C. came. Cops, who happen to be attracted to shorter skirts, loved C. and then ST started to get "exclusive" crime stories.  Unfortunately, I am never into revealing clothes, I can't flirt with cops, (unless they are really cute and smart, which they never are), I don't take shit yet,  was assinged to the beat without a choice.  My first day in 109, I looked around and here came Henry, a handsome Indian guy in  his 40s. "Watch out for cops, don't let them see you upset, don't tell them how much you make, don't let them kow where you live," and here he went again, "cops could be nasty."  How? Why? How come? Are retired cops nasty too? How am I gonna beat C.? What's MY weapon? Why would I? Why should I? Will I ever have a chance to?  Silence, silence, silence. Henry, you don't know either, do you. Well well, let me find out myself. I will find out myself..

       It's 9 :10 a.m., and I am looking for Astoria on my bus map. -That's where my assignment will take me to today. Swimming pool commisioner(there is such a thing?) is celebrating the first day of pool opening. Sounds like fun.  My hubby, P, is surely still soundly asleep in his apt. in Chicago. My families in China, which is 12 hours ahead of us, are probably sitting in front of TV or just coming back from a walk. I, looking forward to a fresh day, am secretly hoping that those long distances won't tear me apart too soon.

       It's a pain in the butt. What's more frustrating is when people try to tell you your English is good. "how long have you been speaking English?" --that's what I get most. Although I willingly took those as complements, the fact that I am never native hurts from time to time. I try to live with it. I try to quench my anxieties to communicate perfectly in a second language. I try to pacify my angers when Englsih words chanllenge me with humungous problems, "delays", confusions that Chinese characters would never do.  That said, I enjoy learning English so much. Every little new phrase gets me excited. I still remember how my high school English teacher taught us "mean," and how steve talked about "beef up" and "get diesel"  Steve, my first and best white friend, has tremendous patience with me. He referred his people as "barbarians" the first time we talked at a pizza place.My vocabulary grew as our friendship deepened. He visited me last week and introduced me to some pick up lines as we were riding a 7 train back to Flushing. -You are the only 10-I-see!  -Are you tired? Coz you've been running in my mind all night. sounds pretty bad? they always work, :p

       The nature of my job sometimes leaves me totally idle for hours during the day. (Of course most times, I would be caught running between downtown Flushing and 109 princenct like a mad woman). idle, however, doesn't equal freedom. The best word to describe my status then would be "stand by". As I've learned along the way, one thing one should never attempt is doing the laundry. Approximately sometime between the "pre-wash" and "wash", that's when suicides and big street fights happen. No kidding. They always do. And now even a thought of laundry alarms me of the potential disasters. (fires? earthquake? terrorists?)   So what I usually do, is finding a Starbucks, or Taipan, or Sago, sit at a table with a view, and let my mind wander. One thing I loved about journalism is its unpredictability, which is exactly what some friends pity me for.(2000 characters a day? what if nothing happens? poor you!) I have to admit it's a dumb idea for the paper to ask for 2000 characters from the reporter each day. After all, it's news, not fiction. People higher up always have hard time understanding simple logic.   There goes the first post of my blog, thanks to the first idle hour of the week. Now I have to go..

       What's the chance of running into someone you randomly meet on subway?--- slim. And in a mega city New York?---slimmer. With that , I could have won the lottery. But I did not. Instead, I ran into someone I randomly met on subway. :)   We noticed him because of the tattoo he was wearing on the leg. It says in Chinese characters-- "hundreds taboos are broken." which is a much cooler pick than most ones I've seen. His son was cute, with longish hair and bright brown eyes.   I bumped into them again in a bookstore, him and his son reading at the table. it's too cute a picture not to notice...  And here are the converations I imagined:  "hi, i saw you once on a subway"  "hi, I like your tattoo "  "hi, hm...."  "hi..."  Honestly, I had no intention of embarking on a conversation.   maybe it's because I've been talkign to much for work, as  a normally quiet person (some of  you might disagree, slightly:))  and thus I am so talking- exhausted...

       that familiar pains kicked in whilst hunger gripped me once again. That's something I never totally lost-- the ability of feeling hungry. My stomach avenges herself once in a while when I overlook her (I think it's a her anyway) . just when I think I can as well work for a straight 12 hours without a bite.  then hunger. it eats me up and convulsion follows instantly...  just let me go....

       I have a "KISS" skateboard, "KISS" turned out to be  a funky rock band I had never heard of. (no offense if you happen to be a fan :P ) When I picked the board, I thoguht it's just a Peking Opera mask. I was quite close because obviously they were inspired by Peking Opera, according to a friend who only spoke on the terms of being anonymous. :P(so he probalby IS a fan)   But the board has got me some attention..  And I was walking with it the other day, when a boy shouted out "nice board!" It was a surprise to me coz I didn't expect people appreciate it. suddenly, I felt this special bond between me and him, just because we both skateboard.(i know it's silly) And I almost blushed... weird... he was like a high school kid and i am so much more senile, and I am still learning :P!   On the same day, the board also befriended me with the women next to me at the train station.    "are you into skateboarding?" she said, "all my 3 sons are."  then we went on chatting for a while. she was trying to tell me that there was a skateboard show in south street seapot that afternoon and asked if I would like to go.   At the end of the conversation, she asked if I am still in high school. (that was embarrasing, but.... wouldn't it be more so if I told her no?) So of course I told her no. .. :P "I am 24." (almost too old to skateboard, :P) That made her start to apologize... (why would I be offended? :P Don't people like it to look young? or maybe she was feeling sorry for me? haha:)  So thanks to "KISS," i have officially become a member of the skateboarding family, no matter how they hate sucky beginners, :)

       *I got this e-mail from Amy today, who've just lost her mother. Warm responses like this have kept me going on this journalism path, no matter how hard it is...*  Dear Amy,THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL YOU HAVE DONE!!!! I can never express in words the gratitude I feel in my heart toward you!!! I hope one day that I can be as equally helpful to you, if not more. Although, I'm not sure that you will ever require my assistance, if there ever comes a time that you need anything done, please do not think twice to let me know, just like you did not think twice to help my mom. This world is a better place because a person such as yourself is here. I am grateful that fate has allowed our paths to cross and I hope we will stay in touch. I am deeply honored that you will be there this Sunday when my mom will finally be able to go on to her next life and be free from all the pain she suffered in this one. I am also deeply honored that I will finally get to meet the person that has strengthened my faith in humanity.Sincerely, Amy

       so it turned out that I've been talking too much. I exceeded my cell phone minutes by $170 last month. (And just in case I haven't mentioned it earlier, I got free incoming calls, nights, weekends, and 400 min anytime for my plan)I was dumbfounded.  If I do the maths right, I talked for 2000+ minutes on the phone for the last 30 days. that's about two days. that's horrible. i knew i talked on tranis a lot. but was it that much? I talked while j walking too, because I was always aware of the danger. yea, i talked at work, at home, stepping out, stepping in, and poeple even called a couple of times while I was in the restroom!  hmm, so it's not my problem. it's my job, right. they never let me go, even when I am off. I turned it off. then they leave messages. then I will need to get back, because they always have questions. and I hate to see them not being helped. but by helping them I am calling again.  I did try. and the world is different after the cell is turned off. It's no longer in pieces; it's complete and fresh; it smells better;  I can read and see now.   it's mine again.

       After being trapped in the airport for 3 hours, I finally came back to New York at midnight. It's 8 a.m. now, and I am trying to wake up for an early assignment. It's one of the few occasions that I really want to QUIT. like Sammy in John Updike's "A&P," how cool is that.

       Being married myself, I can't help wondering about the friendship patterns for married people. to be more specific, how do they manage to make friends or survive without any. :) My sister, married for almost 10 years now, says it's impossible for her to find someone to go to concert with, coz all her friends have families and work to take care of, and nobody really has time for nobody.  Do married people only hang out with married people? Scary as it is, there's some truth in it.=] In my single years, I tended to think them as a most strange species--boring, unimaginative,tired, and protective.. And hey i am married now and still believe most parts of it, sadly enough.=] However, i did make friends with some really wonderful married beings. Those were either being suffocated  in a marriage, dying for a divorce, or, smart enough to juggle between a marriage and life. I think most poeple forget why they get married after a while. That's when they stop reaching out for friends and recoil to the little world of theirs.  It's because of love we get married. and for the same reason, we always need friends.. Her best friend now is her son, according to my sister. And hopefully by the time i am 34, i will have a longer list on which you will still stand. :))

       So here I am, back to Chicago. Now I'll have to get used to not-j-walking again. Chicago is SO quiet compared to New York. No honks, no fire alarms, the streets are much less littered, and drivers yield all the time. :P I just finished cutting Pin's hair. i always cut his hair for him. That's one of a few things that makes me feel like a wife. =] (especially since i haven't been cooking for him for a long time)His hair had grown out like a beaver..:)

       Something sad happened at work today. It was about another Amy I talked to a few weeks ago. (see how we are destined to be connected) Amy called up the newspaper because her mother, emotionally unstable, was missing. We published a story the next day, hoping that someone or herself would see it. It has been almost three weeks now and she has heard nothing yet. The cops aren't doing anything really and have been pushing responsibilites back and forth between the precinct here and the missing people department in Manhattan.  Amy was terribly worried. she was scared. she sent me e-mails again asking if I happen to know any private detective that might help. I don't.  But I do know some detectives at 109 precinct. And that's how I brought this up with Detective Matthews. After some searching, he found that a Jane Doe, female Asian, was found floating in the ocean in Brooklyn the same day Amy's mother walked away. DOA.(it costs just 10 minutes and the minimum bit of patience, and I don't understand why they let the case sitting here for so long)    He checked the descriptions, age, height, weight, scars on the right elbow. it should be her.. Now I will have to call Amy and let her know what's going on. I was somehow involved in such a tragedy. I am not supposed to. I felt kinda sorry that I gave it a push and now Amy has to face something cruel. It might be easier for her if people never find out. But I wanted to help her, badly. "Be cool," I told myself, "she has to know."

       I am usually flattered when people try to tell me I am courageous. And I actually did get that quite a few times in my life--when I came to America, when I got married, and once again when I moved to New York. However, I've come to think that most times, this might just be a romanticized version of "No, I don't think so" :) I've abused my courage extensively of late, as a result of which, my life has wound up in wonderfully weird paths. But Would it be equally disastrous and hurtful if I maxed out on every bit of it?  Do I really have a choice?

       I had the first "ba la" in my life today. (please do advise if you know its English name=])It tastes sth. between a pear and apple. They are heavy fruits. :P I decided that while toting five of them from work. One of my coworkers always shares with us her cute/exotic Taiwanese food/snack/fruits. (yes we do eat all the time at work:)Today it was ba la. people are cute when they bring in food and share. it's one of the happiest moments in the  newsroom~ oh well, i might be obsessed with eating.. Here is what a bala looks like:

       As silly as it can be, sometimes I wonder if people with same names ever share anything in common. Marc, a guy from Germany whom I met in Central Park yesterday, told me that I was the second person he talked to in New York. And the first one was also an "Amy".  "It's not so easy to talk to people here," he said, "harder than Germany." Marc is visiting New York coz he heard that the U.S. government will start collecting foreigners' fingerprints in September, and he decided that he would rather come before that. the conversation started after I boarded for a while in the park. Marc was on the swing next to me.  Oh, yea, that Amy. "she was sitting on the stairs, and we talked about everything, a little bit about New York, a little bit about Bush." That sounds like something I would do--although rather radom,sitting on dirty stairs talkign to a stranger.  See somehow it's my silly belief that all "Amy"s are friendly, laid-back people. (rare exceptions do exsit, Amy Lenk, of course), and understanding, curious positive, courageous, just like myself, :P So what are the drawbacks for Amys? Maybe.. vulnerable sometimes, moody..Still, we are the salt of the world.. Marc and I had some coffee together and another friend of mine joined us briefly.  "He's the second German guy I met," she told me after Marc left, "The first one was also a Marc, and they look just the same.." *laughs*

       It took some time for me to realize that people never speak like they do in my English textbooks. astonishing! When did "likes" start to eat into English? I was on a train, and the conversation happened next to me started to get on my nerves when the girl used the fifth "like" in her one single sentence---"And like in collge, you know like when I was going home like in the summer and like my sister was like abroad"---ok, well, I probably made this up, but you know what I mean, like she just couldn't stop it!  I am a moderate "like" person. Most of my friends are none-to-slight "likers" What this boils down to, I think, is how much one intends to committ to a clear and coherent thinking. What happens when a short sentence is broken into five different parts?  And LIKE how hard are the gay people striving for the rights of getting married--something always taken for granted for the straight, who never give it a second thought.. I was like, obviously, carried away to another subject, but like, never mind..

       I was on a train which was so crowded and shaky that I had to hold fast onto the handle. Just when I did that, I recalled somthing from a book I recently read -- Everybody in America was supposed to grab whatever he could and hold onto it. Some Americans were very good at grabbing and holding, were fabulously well-to-do. Others couldn't get their hands on doodley-suqat-- Of the six months of my marriage, I have been away from my husband most of the times. I was told that only Asian people can do it. Yes, we've been doing long distance for two years now, (out of the 6-year-long relationship,which is also very "Asian" :))and it's still going.  One thing good about dating someone for so long is that you have so many shared memories. We grew up together. We know exactly where each was 3 yrs ago and what each has been through till now. We would laugh together when a certain name or a certain place or a certain time was mentioned, because of the wonderful memories it brings back. He always spoils me and I always let myself be spoiled unconditionally.  And if you havent' realized yet, half of 2004 is gone by now. I haven't been holding very tight to him--thousands miles away.  Thousands miles away And if I could only hold onto one thing in my life, that would be him.
