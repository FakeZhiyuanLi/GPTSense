       The Late Isabel  Twitch Records 2004   I bought this album  sa  Sarabia Optical  sa  UP Shopping Center, along with RSP's  Before Monkey Jump Give Him Banana . The lady in the shop was weird. Hehe. When I entered, she was talking to a foreigner with big hair, and she had this weird accent that gave me the creeps. Hehe. Anways..  This album is the sh!t! Really. If you like listening to Black Metal or the like (Cradle of Filth, Dimmu Borgir, etc) but are afraid of what your elders might say to you, then this thing is a must for you. FHM classified the band as Goth Pop, but I classify them as Pop-Rock with Dark Undertones (not underarms! haha).  The CD has 8 tracks which will never put you to sleep if you listen to them consecutively. The title track is pretty engaging, and is a good introduction to the rest of the album. The song features distorted guitars, a bluesy-jazzy bassline, danceable drums and  Wawi Navarroza 's Shirley Manson (Garbage) meets Dolly Burton (Cranberries) meets Sandra Nasic (Guano Apes) voice. Quite interesting blend, huh?   The rest of the album are mostly comprised of clean, reverberated guitars, subtle basslines, minimalistic drumbeats and a highly echoey vocal track. I think there is too much reverb on the vocals sometimes, as in  Midnight City . Too much reverb sometimes does not make the vocals sit in with the rest of the instruments. But  Zach Lucero  (nU107 jock) mixed the album, so I think the reverb thing was intended.  The songs on the album follow the same old classic gothic kind of lyricism ( ".. I whisper to you with a hollow breath now.. And now I start carrying you like a baby, and how you would cry like a penitent man.."  from  Carrying You Like a Baby ) , with radio-friendly hooks here and there, which makes the songs easy on the ears of many listeners.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this CD an  8 . It was good, but the band could do better.

       Sandwich   I'll make this short..  Yes, &lt;s&gt;andwich has gone indie again. It shows in the recording quality of their new album.  Right Now  exemplifies their indie sound (again). Filipinos really have a knack for the  indie sound .  The album is sweet but forgettable (taken from  Simon Cowell 's remark on one of  Jasmine Trias ' performances). Four-track Mind is still better, way lot better. Although "Thanks.." has its share of the usual Sandwich melodies ( Marc Abaya 's crooning on  2 Trick Pony ) and witty (take  Nahuhulog ), ear-friendly ( Masilungan ), no-brainer ( Astroholiday , thanks to  Raimund Marasigan 's lyricism) songwriting, the songs on the album just don't mix well. I didn't find myself paying attention to certain parts of the album.. maybe the songs are good on their own, but they just don't mix together well, like oil and water.  Sandwich improved their musical abilities, but their sound remains much the same. The album weaves a mystical concoction of one-liners and two-liners in your brain, which makes the experience sweet, but forgettable. It's like the Men in Black flashing the (oh my God i forgot the name right before I type this!) at you after you listen to the album.  Oh well, you could always listen to the album again. Maybe I just need a second helping of it. :)

       Right.. Sometimes I want to  hate  Blogger..  &nbsp;  I already made a fucking post, then it failed to publish! Oh well..  &nbsp;  Woke up at  9 , so I had to hurry, for Math 17 was at  10 .  &nbsp;   Math 17 : Boring   Soc. Sci. 1 : Not boring   English 1 : Quite okay.. I actually wanted to cut it because I wanted to help April out in her Philo exam. But my decision to attend it worked for the best. We had a recorded exercise at the end of the class.   Kas 1 : No prof! I was going to the classroom, holding a glass of corn in my hand and a glass of ice coffee in the other, when I met my classmates who said "JM walang klase!". Haha I was overjoyed.  &nbsp;  So I went to  NIGS  to consult my  Geol 11.1  Prof about the upcoming exam, only to find out from my syllabus that he was only around from 10 to 12am on Tuesdays to Fridays! Damn. So I went to that  tree  (I actually hesitated and tried to feel if it was the second one nearest to the pathway or the third one) that meant a lot to me and wrote a  song  under it. :)  &nbsp;  Oh I'm at a computer shop by the way.. And tomorrow's the opening of  I, Robot . Bye for now.  &nbsp;   Last song heard:  311  (and  The Cure )- Love Song

        Red shirt, red shorts, red shoes, red bag, red cap, red rubber band on my wrist. Red. Last time, I got hit by the love bug.. Now I don't know how I should feel..    I wore red today, as well as last Monday. I'm feeling fucked up, as in. I think my heart is gonna burst anytime.     By the way, we had a long test in Geol 11.. I crammed my review the night before and hours before the exam. I was totally fucked! It wasn't a total disaster, but I hated it..

       IN 100 DAYS   by Anonymous Author   Peter and Tina are sitting in the park doing  nothing, but just gazing into the sky, while all  their friends are having fun with their beloved  half.   Tina: I'm so bored. Just wish I have a boyfriend  now to spend time with.   Peter: I guess we're the only leftovers. We're  the only person who isn't with a date now. (both  sigh in silence for a while)   Tina: I think I have a good idea. Lets play a  game.   Peter: Eh? What game?   Tina: Eem... It's quite simple. You be my boyfriend  for 100 days and I'll be your girlfriend for 100  days. what do you think?   Peter: Oookay... Anyway I don't have any plan for  the next few months.   Tina: You sound like you aren't looking forward  to it at all. Cheer up. Today will be our first  day and our first date. Where should we go?   Peter: What about a movie? I heard that there is  a really great movie in theater now.   Tina: Seems like I don't have any better idea  than this. Lets move. (went to watch their  movies and sent each other home)   Day 2:  Peter and Tina went to a concert together, and  Peter bought Tina a keychain with a star.   Day 3:  They went shopping together for a friend's  birthday present. Share an ice-cream together  and hugged each other for the first time.   Day 7:  Peter drove Tina up onto a mountain and they  watch the sunset together. When the night came  and the moon glowed, they said sat on the grass  gazing at the stars together. A meteor passed  by. Tina mumbled something.   Day 25:  Spend time at a themepark and got onto  rollercoasters, and ate hotdogs and cotton  candy. Peter and Tina got in the haunted house  and Tina grabbed someone's hand instead of  Peter's hand by accident. They laughed together  for a while.   Day 67:  They drove pass a circus and decided to get in  to watch the show. The midget asked Tina to play  a part as his assistant in the magic show. Went  around to see other entertainments around after  the show. Came to a fortune teller and she just  said "Treasure every moment from now on" and a  tear rolled down the fortune teller's cheek.   Day 84:  Tina suggested that they go to the beach. The  beach wasn't so crowded that day. They have  their first kiss with each other just as the sun  is setting.   Day 99:  They decided to have a simple day and is  deciding  to have a walk around the city. They sits down  onto a bench.   1:23 pm  Tina: I'm thirsty. Lets rest for a while first.   Peter: Wait here while I go buy some drinks.  What would you like?   Tina: Eem... Apple juice will be just fine.   1:43 pm  Tina waiting for about 20 minutes and Peter  havent return. Then someone walked up to her.   Stranger: Is your name Tina?   Tina: Yes, and may I help you?   Stranger: Just now down there on the street a  drunk driver has crashed into a guy. I think its  your friend.   Tina ran over to the spot with the stranger and  sees Peter lying on the floor with blood over  his face and her apple juice still in his hands.  The ambulance came and she went to the hospital  with Peter.   Tina sat outside the emergency room for five and  a half hours. The doctor came out, and he sigh.   11:51 pm  Doctor: I'm sorry, but we did the best we could.  He is still breathing now but God would take him  away from us very soon. We found this letter  inside his pocket.   The doctor hands over the letter to Tina and she  goes into the room to see Peter. He look weak  but peaceful. Tina read the letter and then she  burst into tears. Here is what the letter said:   "Tina, our 100 days is almost over. I had fun  with you during all these days. Although you may  be greedy sometimes and less thoughtful, but  these  all brought happiness into my life. I have realize  that you are a really cute girl and blamed myself  for never taken the time to knowing that. I have  nothing much to ask for, but I just wish that we  can extend the day. I want to be your boyfriend  forever and wish that you can be beside me all  the time. Tina, I love you."   11:58  Tina: (sobbing) Peter. Did you know what was the  wish I made on the night there was a meteor. I  asked God to let us last forever. We were  suppose to last 100 days so Peter! You can't  leave me! I LOVE YOU, but can you come back to  me now? I love you Peter. I LOVE YOU.   As the clock struck twelve, Peter's heart  stopped beating. It was 100 days.   Send this to EVERYONE you love or hate... just  everyone that has taken a part in your life.  Tell the guy or girl that you love them before  its too late. You never know whats going to  happen tomorrow. You never know who will be  leaving you and never return      "Super Star There You Are, Shining so  Freely on my mind"

       Two Thursdays ago..  July 22, 2004 :  I went to  SM North Edsa  to attend  Jen 's album promotion. I thought I was late (for the schedule was at 1700 but I arrived there at 1745), but I wasn't; she arrived late too, for she came from a taping at GMA. I brought my copy of her album, and after the show, I waited for a whole hour to get it signed. Fuck the grudgy stupid guard. I got my CD and my cap signed (she was left-handed!), and I also got a poster. I had so many things I wanted to say to her, but I ended up  speechless  when it was my turn to get an autograph. Anyways, I got to give her my poem I wrote earlier that day. All's well that ends well. :)  Thursday last week:  July 29, 2004 :  One hell of a reunion... I went to visit  Pisay  with my friends.. Wow, everything changed.. even the people! There were indeed a lot of changes, but I think things have become too boring there. Haha. We went there to claim our diplomas and check out the people and places.  Saturday:  July 31, 2004 :  Oh my,  Level of Significance  has reunited for one and a half our of practice at Red Damien Rehearsal Studio! We were a little bit rusty, but we got  Ocean Avenue  ( Yellowcard ),  2-Trick Pony  ( Sandwich ), and  The Reason  ( Hoobastank ) right in a few tries. I had a hard time singing  The Reason , but it was fulfilling anyway.   Today:   I'm in love with somebody who doesn't want to.. Maybe she's afraid to.. I don't know. I don't know what to do. Can somebody help me?  I miss Mel.
