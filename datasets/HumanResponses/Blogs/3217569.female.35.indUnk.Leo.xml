      recent events in my life have truly been a test of my character.  certain qualities have emerged where they were once just under the surface.  i know now the extent of my capacity to forgive.   unexpectedly, i was able to summon the willingness to forgive which lay dormant from within.  then i felt the power of healing that it brings.   under normal circumstances, i would have retaliated.  i would have exacted vengeance as a spontaneous reaction.  i am a proud leo after all.  when my ego is being trampled on, i instantly unleash a barrage of words and go for the kill.  i am so short fused that any slight provocation will certainly incur my ire.  i once read that the Spirit blows changes as it wills.  i must have been grazed by the wind.  it brought self-realization that deliverance from adversity requires forgiveness and acceptance.  although i had not been completely free from pain, forgiveness has brought me peace.   Adversity is not without comforts and hopes. - Bacon

      i've been having recurring abdominal pains. during such bouts, i'd take swigs of Pepto Bismol.  the pink stuff usually provides instant relief and a trip to the M.D. becomes unnecessary.    once though, i took aspirin to relieve myself of muscle aches and pains stemming from a backbreaking spring cleaning routine.  it was a bad move.  on top of that, i felt excruciating pain in my tummy and knew then that the tiny white pill was not welcome in my system.  this time, i acknowledged that i may have serious stomach problems. i was overcome with paranoia and finally scheduled a doctor's appointment.  i underwent a medical procedure called Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy(EGD).  I also went for an ultrasound of the stomach.  after nearly ten nerve-wracking days, i called the Doc and was told that all was okay.  no inflammation, no bacteria, no ulcers. no worms.  whew!  what she saw however was "fat in the liver".  but Doc, i have fat over 90% of my body!!  did you not see my bulging tummy?  she said it was no major concern. it wasn't a disease or anything.  asked about my height and weight since she couldn't recall.  said it usually occurs to people with drinking problems or people who are overweight. ouch!  i'm definitely not alcoholic so i obviously fall in the latter category.  i am now on a diet. again!  doctor's orders. bah! have to lose at least 10 lbs. as if!  have been trying to shake it off for the last what, ten years?  during the last few weeks, my diet consisted mostly of bread, crackers, fruits, cereals, veggies, soup, salads, etc.  with that, i hope the "fat in the liver" and elsewhere will soon disappear.  i'm keeping my fingers crossed.

      she was only five years old when her father and i separated.  at that time, i didn't have to explain much.  inspite of her inquisitive nature, questions about our situation had been few, if none at all.    back then, she had not suspected that ours was already a failed marriage since we parted amicably.  her father's constant presence only brought a semblance of normalcy.  in the beginning, she hardly felt his absence. in the evenings, he would leave long after she was asleep.  it was only after several early mornings, after weeks and months had passed,  that she'd began to wonder why daddy had always left for work early.  soon after, i had to let her know that daddy had already been sleeping in grandma's house.  she asked why and i think i blamed it then on our cramped living space.  tati had started leaving with us then and it was the most convenient answer i could give her.  she found logic in my answer. had wished that we had a bigger place so daddy can move back in.  it almost broke my heart keeping the truth from her like that.    inevitably, the truth had to be told. i was choking back the words, afraid of finally voicing out what i had rehearsed several times in my mind.  i used carefully chosen words to explain the situation in an age-appropriate manner, as if that would soften the blow. i don't know how i managed to convey the truth when i was not convinced of it myself.  when accepting the truth back then had been difficult for me.  but i went about it nonchalantly, belying every screwed up emotion i felt from within.  after all was said and done, i felt relieved.  i knew we'd be okay. she is blessed with strength, wisdom, sense of humor and resilience beyond her years and that's what carried us through.

      tati had been there with me long before i gave birth.  in fact, she had been around since my own birth.    throughout the years, she had been like a second mom to us.  she was the one who indulged us with all the latest fads during our youth.  she would bring home little luxuries from trips abroad. during one of her trips to Hong Kong, she bought each of us a Game & Watch.  we went completely gaga over those hand-held consoles akin to the gameboy. she also introduced us to the Sanrio characters she had seen in Japan.  it was then that i first fell in love with Hello Kitty and Little Twin Stars.  she bought me my first Denman brush, St. Michael's socks and undies,  my fist pair of Nike's and all the Cadburys and Toblerones we used to stuff in our mouths.  during weekends, she'd also take us to Quad or the Rizal Theater to see the latest flicks.  afterwards, we'd eat at Swibak's, Magnolia Ice Cream House or eat delicious steak burgers at the Makati Supermarket.  she provided us with more than just the tangibles.  she gave us love, affection, caring, humor and yes, even discipline and occasional petty annoyances.  years later, she's still at it.  she remains to be a fixture in my life and now in my daughter's as well.  her life revolves around that of the little one's.  she showers her with all the love and affection that only a true mother unconditionally gives.  she does so much for her every single day.  i constantly remind Nicole of how fortunate she is to have Tati around.  nicole loves her just as much.  and so do i ... even though i barely show it.

      she was clad in a simple white gown.  her long black hair was swept up in a ballerina bun right on top of her crown.  pinned against it was a flower-trimmed tiara with a thin veil cascading halfway down her back.  lastly, she wore a set of tiny pearl earrings and a matching necklace and bracelet that completed the ensemble.  she was second to last in their procession.  as they slowly inched their way towards the altar,  i could tell that she was a little nervous inspite of all the smiling faces that turned to greet them.  i probably had the biggest smile in that crowd.  i couldn't help but feel proud.  everything turned out just as i had imagined.  my little one looked every bit like a little princess especially when she flashed a smile as she passed us by.  it's amazing how much emotion is stirred up within you when you see your child go through yet another milestone. to think this is just her First Communion!  i'm pretty sure i'll be a nervous wreck come her wedding day.  i hope that doesn't come for a very, very, VERY long time.

         i spent most of elementary and high school in a catholic school. it was beyond the pink walls of poveda where my religious education all began.  although i have not become as religious as Ms. Hilario would have liked me to be,  I have at least become a person of deep faith.  however, i have faltered in many ways and by no means a candidate for sainthood.  i am after all just a guilty sinner.  having said that, i obviously am not the one who can indoctrinate the little one.     nearly two years ago, i decided to register her in a catechism class.  i felt that she needed a dose of religion which was unprescribed at her public school.  therefore, i had to enlist the help of our parish in providing her some religious foundation.     finally, it will be her First Communion this coming sunday, May 16th.  i am as excited as she is about getting her all primmed up for the occasion.  i eagerly anticipate yet another milestone in her life as she takes her leap of faith.

      an air of discontentment has been hovering at the workplace for quite sometime now.  no doubt that a meltdown is at hand unless someone decides to step to the fore.  the only problem is that no one seems intent on doing so.  that is what's totally flustering about this whole situation. no one wants to take charge and bring things to order.  needless to say, the lack of responsibility and perhaps the inefficiency and incompetence of certain individuals only aggravates the situation.  those of us at the bottom end of the pecking order can only hope that issues can be ironed out to everyone's satisfaction.  until then, i'll have to keep praying for a miracle and hope that i can just move away from here.

      today is mother's day.  as in years past, we celebrated it without much fanfare.  i just invited my mother-in-law over a quiet dinner of linguine with clam sauce and baked chicken breast fillets.  after our meal, the little one hands over a card.  she wrote:        Happy Mother's Day!       I love you very much.       Thank you for the wonderful things you gave me!  as always, i am touched by her expression of love and gratitude.  i should be used to it by now.  after all, she showers me with those words every single day.  i feel so wonderfully blessed every single time.  i wish i could have done the same for my own mom.  as a little kid growing up, i don't remember ever uttering those words as freely as the little one does.  strangely enough, my family is just that way.  yes, we do love each other - we all know it, but we just never say it.  well, i'd like to think that we've become more expressive as we got older.  i just feel that she deserved to be told that every single moment of every single day that she loved and nurtured and cared for us, as we were growing up. i owe a great part of what i am now as a mother by her example.  so to you i write and to quote the little one:  Dearest Mommy,        Happy Mother's Day!       I love you very much.       Thank you for the wonderful things you gave me!       Now and always!

      i am a very outspoken person. sometimes i wish that i could just clam up and avoid confrontations.  i wish that i could just walk away and allow for things to simmer down.  instead i boil over and let every emotion spew forth.  that's just the way i've always been.  i always have to say something especially when i know that i speak the truth.  i am not self-righteous.  i realize that i am not exempt from culpability.  on those occasions however,  i am not afraid to admit my mistakes and take responsibility for them.    i live by a simple credo.  be nice and i'll be ten times nicer to you.  be nasty and i'll be the worst bitch you'll ever come across with.  this is one facet of my character i will never compromise as people who know me already know too well.

      my colleague and i were given an early mother's day treat yesterday.  one of our bosses took us out to lunch at a swank italian restaurant.   he extended the invite as a show of gratitude to us for all the support we provide him and the rest of the diplomats.  he did not have to do that.  what we do, after all, is part of our job.  it was a rare event for it isn't often that we get that sort of "pat-in-the-back".... not in the nearly twelve years that i've worked there.  i may forget the taste of the scrumptious pasta alla vognole i picked out but his kind gesture would always be remembered and forever appreciated.

      we separated in october 2001.  strangely, we never really had blown up fights.  surely, there were typical spats and minor quarrels which were usually forgotten by days' end.  but when hurtful words were hurled at each other more often than was necessary we knew it was time to let go. the tension and the stress became too much to bear and a parting of ways became imminent.  i guess our marriage suffered a slow death.    like all deaths, a period of grieving ensued.  i spared him all the drama and did not even shed a tear when he said goodbye.  deep within, i felt a painful lump in my throat and fought back all the painful emotions for fear that it will all come streaming down my cheeks.  i was trying to be brave.  for myself....for the little one.    in the weeks and months that followed, i tried to mask all the pain and suffering i was going through.  i felt a need to shield my baby from all the negative emotions.  i did not want her to absorb any of it.  she did not deserve to go through what i was going through.  over time, i became fully immersed in a river of sorrow.  i felt myself going deeper into the murky waters of misery.  but then i came up for air and knew what was best for me.  i learned to survive.

      lately, i often find myself pondering about my financial situation.  it bothers me that i take home a paltry wage no matter how much hardwork i put in at the workplace.  i did get a raise a couple of months ago yet i still find myself in a precarious state of finances towards months' end.  i realize that if i just stick to a budget plan that i might have enough funds left over for savings.  heaven knows, i'm no stickler for penny pinching.   money just seems to slip from my hands like water.  i will have to take control from here on and just learn to discipline myself.  after all, a single mom like myself with a daughter going off to college in about 10 years and my own retirement to worry about in 35 years, i sure hope that i can buy all that time and save up for a decent future for me and the little one.

      the day started like any other on this first day of may.  woke up early as usual and sipped a mug of freshly-brewed coffee.  the flavor was strong enough to jolt me out of my morning stupor which was probably what i needed.  i felt revitalized (not so much from a long nights' sleep but from the caffeine rush) and  needed to channel my energies into something.  hence i've decided to start blogging again.  hopefully, i could stay committed to this one and type in entries on a daily basis.  but given my uneventful life...oh well, let's see how long this one will last.  and so here i go again.....

      tati and nicole are done with their packing.  their shared luggage is already packed to the hilt.  i don't even want to see what's stuffed in that big, black luggage.  it seems they've managed to squeeze their entire wardrobe in for less than two month's stay in san diego.  either that or it contains half of nicole's stuff toy collection.  like i said, i am afraid to see what's in it.    thankfully, the bag's built with in-line skate wheels.  i should be able to cruise along with it at the airport with total ease.  well, i forget, i have my own two-piece luggage to carry on.  small ones really that should fit in the overhead bins.  i'm only staying for two weeks anyway.  i can definitely afford to pack light.  i sure hope i can stick to that goal come friday night.  that's when i plan to do my packing.  after that, we're good to go!  see ya!

      when i walk our tree-lined street, i always look up admiringly at such beauty of nature, ever-changing with the passing of each season. i am particularly drawn to this one tree that looms large on the corner of 167th street. whether in the dead of winter or in the height of summer, it evokes a certain melancholy which is even more evident during a gray and rainy early evening.  i've never written poems but am inspired to write this.  inasmuch as it is about a tree it also speaks much about me.   Firmly and deeply rooted In its faith, it stands still Amid the tempestuous storm In its strength, it remains Steadfast against the vortex where In its hold, it struggles With all its might to break free In its resolve, it summons  From the depth of its being a nearly forgotten courage and In its fear, it unleashes A power gathered from obscurity In its determination, it prevails at last Unyielding against the raging force.  And as the storm passes In its weariness, it breathes  Finally relieved yet weakened In its resilience, it encounters new-found strength Needed for further turmoil ahead for throughout its life it grapples against Beatings of nature, time and again In its hope, it finds fortitude And the confidence to overcome In its prayer it finds comfort  and basks under the sun In its solitude it once again  withstands the test of time.

      tomorrow is nicole's last day of school.  that means - no more homeworks, no more worrying about what to pack for lunch, no more it's-time-for-bed power struggles, no more school projects and book reports, no more PTA meetings (not as if i attend them anyway), no more getting-ready-for-school morning madness, no more school bus issues - no more of those for the next two months, at least. should be enough time to recharge and gear up for third grade.  until then, will just make the most of this summer break, finally!

      i love daydreaming which explains my usual pensive mode.  i indulge in such reveries several times throughout the course of a day.  i chase after dreams that are so elusive. however, when i escape into my inner sanctum and begin daydreaming, all those aspirations seemingly become real if only for a fleeting moment.  i embrace the small comfort that such imaginary experiences bring.  it enkindles hope that what i wish for may someday be realized.  it serves to remind me that the small blessings in my life have already brought me a step closer to my dreams.

      today is the advent of the summer solstice.  warm weather of late has been the most unmistakable telltale sign that the season is upon us.  people everywhere have already been wearing light, summer clothing the past few weeks. school closings are expected to take place at the end of the week while some have already shut their doors to reopen only in the fall.  it's a wonderful reminder that my vacation is drawing near.  i've already filed my vacation leave to commence on july 6th.  i'm taking a two-week respite from the ever-growing demands at the workplace.    i've been toiling quite excessively since my boss passed away.  i've taken on the burden of a heavy workload for at least a year now. it doesn't seem that a reprieve is imminent since no announcement has been officially made as to his replacement.  i am trying to get all the work done and am doing pretty well under the circumstances.  i just need this break and recharge before the UN General Assembly starts in September that's sure to bring an onslaught of work.  we're scheduled to fly west-bound on july 4th.  i can't wait for a change of pace and scenery.  i'm sure to enjoy the sun, warm breeze and made-for-hollywood lookers.  california here we come!

      i worked under his direct supervision and i was technically his only underling.  he took me under his wing as a parent would for a child.  he seemingly regarded me in such a manner due probably to the proximity of my age to those of his three grown children. in return, i showed him the kind of respect not solely based on hierarchy. i gave him one typically accorded by a child to a parent.  it hadn't always been that way especially in the beginning. i'd be typing away at my desk or be engaged in a phone conversation while he was probably doing the same on the other side of the wall, always behind closed doors.  with the exception of the usual salutations, the necessary consultations, and sometime disagreements, our interaction was usually kept to a minimum.    my affinity with him began when he called me one day to his office.  he told me that from that day forward, he would like to see my signature affixed on all the financial reports i've been doing next to his own and the Ambassador's.  he wanted credit where credit was due.  he wanted others to recognize all the hardwork i put in month after month, report upon report, in ink form.  it was an unprecedented gesture i will never forget.  it felt good knowing that my boss recognized and valued my work.  for that, i am forever grateful.  today is his first death anniversary.  we were all shocked upon receiving the news.  we knew that he was supposed to be disharged from the hospital that day.  he was extremely eager to go home.  well, he did finally make it home.  he did make the journey to his final home.

      apart from the usual chore-filled weekend, tati, nicole and i treated ourselves to bowls of delicious  pho , a traditional Vietnamese noodle soup,  at a recently opened Thai-Vietnamese restaurant just a good walking distance away from home.  i couldn't resist the temptation and took an extra order of their  Happy Family Platter  which included 2 pieces each of 5 different appetizers - beef satay, chicken satay, shrimp rolls, fish cakes and crabmeat rolls.  the dish was absolutely dee-eee-licious!!!  the dish did live up to its name - we were indeed a Happy Family after all that good eatin'!!  we will definitely be back to sample their wide variety of pho dishes.    well, i am still on a diet and exercise routine.  i think i'm still holding up on my end of the deal.  i've lost 2 more pounds as a result of all the walk i've been walking.  at the end of the week,  i should be entitled to some reward in the form of pho. after all, it's mostly liquid so how much could that hurt my diet.  bah! i just wish i had a metabolism rate that ticked away as fast as the meter of a new york city cab.  well, there's nothing i can do about that so i'll just have to double the pace and give real meaning to the term power walking.  yep!  power walking it is! i'll definitely be power walking my way to Pho Mekong whenever i could.

      a friend of mine is probably already at JFK Airport en route to Houston.  in a matter of hours she will partake in what will probably be one of the worst crises of her life.  last weekend, her cousin found his wife unconscious and frothing at the mouth.  she was immediately rushed to the hospital where she had worked as a nurse for more than a decade.  days later, she was declared brain-dead.   her family - a husband only in his mid-40's and two daughters, ages 13 and 14, are already being pressured to pull the plug and sign off her vital organs for donation.  they have barely come to grips with the harsh reality of such a dizzying chain of events and now this.  how can they be expected to even consider donating her body parts at this stage?    how could they even begin to believe that she is already dead when her body is still warm to the touch, her chest still rising and falling in labored breathing and her heart still beating?    it seems to be a cruel trick of fate or a grim medical setback to declare a person as brain-dead.  it fuels misconceptions that only the brain is not functioning but all other organs are.  such false hopes only intensifies the agony of an already bewildered family.  why not simply say that the person is  dead ? period.  why issue a certificate of brain death?  spare the family the specifics of such medical terminology.  more so, spare the family the burden of deciding when to pull the plug.  it only perpetuates the idea that a person's actual death is incumbent upon them and thus creates further dilemma.  her family cannot decide alone and have called on relatives across the US to assist in the decision-making.  almost certainly, the painful truth will hit them if and when the decision is made to finally let go.    may God give them the courage, comfort and strength to undergo such a heartbreaking task.  may she rest in peace.

      every so often, well-meaning friends and family suggest that i jump into the dating scene once again.  i've been on the receiving end of comments such as "it's about time you started dating again" ... "oh but you're still so young, you have yet to find mr. right" ... "let me introduce you to so and so" ... "blah blah blah".  i really appreciate their concern with regards to my lovelife.  well, more like the lack of it, i guess.    what's irksome though is the assumption that i am not totally happy just because i am not in a relationship. okay, i may not be euphoric all the time, but who is anyway?  i just feel that a blissful existence is not dependent on mere dalliances alone. besides, my main happiness springs forth from an abundant source of love, joy, and laughter that is Nicole.  without a doubt, she fills my life with such happiness i've never known.  however, at this point, i just don't feel that i'm missing out where matters of the heart is concerned.  it is just not a priority for me right now.  i'm not shutting myself in.  i'm just not reaching out just yet.  if and when it happens, then it happens.    right now, i'm just enjoying free time alone whenever i get a chance to escape from the normal grind.  i retreat to a familiar place where solitude brings comfort and serenity becomes company.  hopefully, i'll be sharing that space with a special someone someday.  for now, it's me and the little one and nothing could make me happier!

      i saw her coming towards me on the subway platform and immediately took notice of her wet cheeks.  she stopped and stood about an arms' length away from me.  i stood there thinking that it was perhaps the steep descent of the subway stairs that caused her to work up a sweat.   the W pulled into the station and i let her board the train first.  strangely there were empty seats during that rush hour commute and i settled on a seat across from hers.  less than a minute into our ride through the tunnel, she started to weep seemingly oblivious of those around her.    the sight of her with tears streaming down her cheeks left me dumbfounded.  there is no lack of emotion in new york city subways.  i've often seen outbursts of emotions.  however it's usually of anger or frustration.  her display of emotion was a first for me.  i wanted so much to reach out to her.  had wanted to comfort her and tell her that everything will be okay.  but i didn't.   instead, i just sat there uncomfortably and shifted my gaze at those ads i've seen a hundred times over.  i feel like kicking myself in the behind for not doing anything. i could have been a first for her as well.  i could have been the first one to give sympathy and support when it could have mattered the most.  but shit i didn't.  how different could that be from giving a seat up for an elderly or pregnant woman?  or from holding the subway door for a complete stranger?  or from helping a mother bring a stroller up and down the stairs which i've done so many times before?  why did i not spring to action just the same?  i got off at the next stop and glanced back.  she seemed much calmer inspite of her still tear-stained cheeks.  i stood on that platform and did the only thing i could still do. i said a silent prayer for her - for the one that got away.

      i woke up feeling a bit sore from all the walking i did yesterday.  if i am to win this battle of the bulge then diet alone will not do it for me. a little bit of exercise is necessary to complete the regimen.  i will not attempt to engage in another rigid exercise routine that i know i cannot commit to.  i'll just get off the bus about fifteen blocks or so from my usual stop and walk the rest of my way home.  hopefully, weather conditions will be conducive for this undertaking. yesterday's balmy weather was just perfect for what turned out to be a leisurely walk along northern blvd.  tomorrow, i'll try to walk at a faster pace and burn, burn, burn the calories away.  i firmly resolve to do this with the help of thy grace.  so help me god.

      i really have neglected this space ever since i went on vacation.  for starters, i really had a fun and restful two-week break in san diego.  it was such a blast spending time with relatives i haven't seen in years.  mostly, i just pigged out and took catnaps in between.  tita tessie just whipped up all the delicious meals that i so missed ever since she moved out of ny.  i'm now trying to shake off all the extra pounds that i gained and bring the numbers back to pre-sabbatical poundage.   tati and nicole will be returning in about two weeks.  i miss the little one terribly.  talking to her by phone and via internet at least three times a day offers little consolation.  this is the first time we've spent so much time apart from each other.  it's made me realize how much my life is really all about her.  home is where she is and for now my place is just an empty space without her.  the countdown begins: 14 days more.
