      So after Fridays heavy drinking I decided it would be in my interest to get a culture boost and to see my parents.  We were supposed to be going to  urlLink Bodiam Castle  to see a war re-enactment but as I had a hangover I got up a little late and then got stuck in a traffic jam on the M4.  By the time I got to my parents it was too late to get to Bodiam so we settled on going to  urlLink Polesden Lacey  which is an Edwardian House in Sussex. The things I found most interesting was the early photographs of the family that lived there and some of the info on WWI (which ties in with the Bird Song Book I am reading)  My parents kindly paid for me to become a member of the National Trust which made the people at the entrance gate slightly bemused as to why a scruffy dreadlocked 20 something would hold a membership card.  After looking round for a bit and some ice creams we decided to head for a nearby landmark. Rykas Burger Bar - which is the favourite joint for hundreds of bikers from the surrounding areas. After admiring some huge bikes we took a small path which leads up to Box Hill where once we got to the summit we found the grave of Major Peter Labelliere who was a local eccentric who got buried head down (His reasoning was that, in a topsy turvy world, he would be the only one to end up the right way round)  After that it was home again and I played some of the new  urlLink Battlefield Vietnam: WWII expansion mod  which is a little disappointing.

      Well not much happened in the week. I got a new soundsystem installed into my car which plays my MP3's really loud.       Loud music makes me drive really quickly, so maybe this is  urlLink not such a great idea .  On Friday night I went into town for a couple of beers with James. We started off in the Purple Turtle which was really packed because the rain was stopping people going into the beer garden.  I was at the bar when I smelt something so familiar that it reminded me of someone or something which had happened to me. I looked around and suddenly saw a girl I once had a one night stand with. I think she saw me but she was with another bloke so I didn't acknowledge her and she didn't acknowledge me. I must have recognised her perfume  After a while talking to a few mates we saw there, we left for The Pavlov's Dog which had more room.  In Pavlov's I spotted a workmate of mine and stayed with her and her boyfriend until closing.  On the way out I stupidly had the idea to go to the  urlLink After Dark Club  which everyone drunkenly agreed to.  I haven't been to The After Dark since me and my mates put on a night called  urlLink Technosense  on there. It was originally the only place you would find 15 year olds drinking to the sounds of Nirvana and Radiohead. I have good memories of going there and coming home paralytic after drooling over 18 year old Indie girls with their square glasses.  Once in the door (ushered in by the same bouncers who have worked there since I first started going) I paid one of the 12 Thai girls that work there my Â£5 and skulked in to see a dance floor rammed with people well into their twenties and thirties.  To mine and James' great delight there was a really old couple almost shagging in the corner.  After a while boogying to the eighties and nineties hits (including Duran duran's Wild Boys which went down really well) some girl came up to me and said in the usual school disco style "My mate really wants to talk to you!". My heart suddenly leapt at the thought of scoring so easily.  "Yes, yes!" I said  Then she pointed over the dancefloor and I started to walk towards the figure of an attractive girl. The first girl then grabbed me and then said, "No, not her". "This is my mate..."  I turned and saw an old (male) HMV workmate. My heart dropped and then I just burst out laughing.  After a while chatting and drinking I went home with a smile on my face.  This blog entry was made with me listening to The Killers (with the song Mr. Brightside on repeat!)     I've been out and about with my parents today and am going out with them again tomorrow so I will post about that soon.

       urlLink Boy chokes to death at cinema   Who in their right mind would take a 3 year old to see Alien Vs Predator!  I was looking forward to seeing it until I heard it has been released in America as a PG13 movie or something similar to that. I'm hoping that there will be a more adult version released this side of the pond.

       urlLink DMC World final tickets  came into the shop today. I'm really looking forward to it.  I've never been to the Hammersmith Apollo, though I suppose it can only be an improvement on the Brixton Academy. BrixAc has the worst acoustics in a venue I have ever heard! Plus it looks like Turbosound are providing a rig this year, which will tonk

      Well I woke up without a hangover as such, just dodgy guts :(  I Robot was ok, but I think Will Smith was the wrong choice for the role. Big Willy as he likes to be known was good in the Fresh Prince of Belair and the hero in independence Day and he was ok in "Ali".  The film itself was littered with product placement which was extremely cheesy. The amount of times you saw a Converse logo or an Audi car was just bordering on infomercial territory.  The story line was actually quite good, and the film did keep some ties to Asimov's book which i thought was nice, but they did repeat the same things a few times for the dumber members of the audience.     The special effects were pretty cool, I especially liked the transparent skin the robots had. When the main robot character was speaking you could see intricate mechanics moving his facial features. The main exciting special effect scene was a car chase which was very reminiscent of the one in the Matrix: Reloaded.  At one point I even felt a bit sorry for the robots, which is one of the main themes behind the film (when can you call something that is a machine human?)  I would give the film a 6 out of 10 which is pretty much what I would give this dude for his  urlLink Optimus Prime Costume   Today I'm listening to Scarface: The Fix

      Well I've just come in from the pub, so this is my first drunk blog entry. The film was ok, I'll do a proper review later.  After the film we went to the Purple Turtle  urlLink http://www.purpleturtlebar.com/newsite/index.php   Suprisingly we met a couple of people from the rave last night, which was pretty weird  Anyway....  The last time I went to the turtle I got some girl to flash her tits at me which gave me the feeling that I still have the old mojo (oh dear)  This time some bird was showing me and my mates her nipple piercing which was pretty outstanding too. This doesn't sound too exciting, but she was unbelievably good looking.  Well I'm going to end this entry before I say something I shouldn't

      Well I went to the party last night for a bit. My housemate drove me down with a couple of people who are regulars on the free party scene. The party was at the back of someone's 40th birthday which was funny. Ooops soundsystem were playing drum and bass and a bit of hardcore. It was fun to watch the crowd from the 40th birthday mingle with the ravers.  I didn't really get into it and I didn't do any drugs because the party was too small to warrant a comedown the next day.  I persuaded my housemate to drive me back around 3.00am as most of the other people had gone on to a proper rave about 15 miles away. (not to mention a DJ started playing hard trance which put me off even further.  It was good to meet up with a few of the old Reading party crew. I had a good chat with a couple of our old soundsystem "rivals". They seem to have calmed down just like me. It's funny that the people who put on the parties get pissed off with them a lot quicker than the usual punters.  Looks like I'm off to see Will Smith in I Robot a bit later and maybe have some drinks     I read the book when I was a teenager. I liked it so much I stole it from the school library. Apparently this is not based on any of the short stories that are featured in the book but the effects look good and I'm quite looking forward to a good summer popcorn movie.  today's blog entry was written with Jay Z and DJ Dangermouse's Grey Album playing in the background (basically it's Jay Z rapping over some reworked Beatles samples) EMI got mightily pissed of with this so it's only available to download on the net  urlLink http://www.illegal-art.org/audio/grey.html

        Wow, so this is my new blog.       After seeing some other blogs around the web I'm going to use this thing to try and convince myself that I don't lead a boring life. ;)      Well what can I mention in my first blog entry?      Well I'm just out of a three year relationship so I'm a bit down so this is one of the ways I'm going to try and keep myself busy.        At the moment I'm reading Birdsong by Sebastian Faulks          Reading this is part of my little quest to read some of the books featured in the 'nations favourite' competition.   So far I have read the His Dark Materials trilogy, Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy and attempted to read Catch 22 (but failed due to it's humour being a bit different to mine). Still to come is Fahrenheit 451 and Catcher in the Rye.      In another attempt to keep me busy I have been invited to a free party tonight in some barn. I haven't been to a rave in ages so it might be fun, not sure if I want to drive though. Ahh well I best get myself out, you never know I might find a nice new girlie!        I'm writing this blog entry with AiM - Cold Water Music - playing in the background
