      So, I read Lacy's walk down memory lane. I love how she remembers details. There's an interesting story every time she recollects something. It's not always what one might call "accurate", but it sure is interesting.   urlLink As she mentioned , we generally discuss how we got to where we are, but like, way back at the beginning. After "first, there was nothing", but before "...and they all lived happily ever after". This story is that story, between then and now. (Now now? Or then now? When was then now? We just missed it.) (All poorly picked out paraphrases are courtesy of Spaceballs: The Search for an Accurate Memory.)  Lacy and I are technically high school sweethearts, which is great, cause it illicits that "awwww" from people hearing this for the first time. I like that. I love that I can tell our child(ren) that. Back in that day, I was young, and poor. I did have lots of energy, but all too often (as she was sure to mention) it was used on things other than spending time with her. I regret that somewhat, cause that's what we fought about, and I really really hate fighting with her. She'll never believe that, but I do. So, being young, and poor, I wasn't the best boyfriend. Sorry, sweetheart.  We were supposed to get married outside three years ago, but it rained. A lot. Not as planned. Mother Nature owes me. Big. She started the repayment by giving us Xander. But she's not done. I'm watching you, Mother Nature. Even though it rained, and we were soaked, and I was really tired, and we didn't have the wedding we had planned, the very most important thing that was supposed to happen that day happened. We got married. Yeah, the details weren't perfect, but she was. I've never seen her more beautiful.  She doesn't remember the day the way I do, and that's okay. We got to here from there, through better and worse, sickness and health, cats and dogs, houses and hot tubs, doctors for ankles and doctors for babies, cable and satellite, new cars and used cars, bathroom remodeling and fence rebuilding.  Eventually, I got better, but that was awhile in coming. Not that I'm perfect now. Which sucks to admit. But I love her, and as cliche as it is to say, now more than ever. She's put up with an incredible amount of ill-advised to horrendously stupid things from me. And she doesn't even bring these things up every day! Just when I've done something else stupid. I think I'm a stupidity-debt indentured servant. But you know what, I wouldn't change it for anything. I can never undo that stuff, but I can try to be as good a husband to her as I can.  So many things have happened since we've gotten married, not to mention all the stuff before that. I can't imagine my life without her, and I don't even want to consider it.  As long as she doesn't call me her hubby, cause I hate that.

      Robert Scoble, on his popular blog  urlLink  Scobleizer: Microsoft Geek Blogger  , has written about Windows XP Media Center Edition (referred to as MCE from here on out) a number of times recently with high praise. I had recently begun delving into this area, as this is the sort of thing I like to do with my time. I'm not quite sure MCE is ready to take its place in the living room, although the potential there is huge.  Let me toss out a bit of background so as to establish my perspective. I love all things computer-driven. I also love all things home theater. MCE would seem to be right up my alley. I subscribe to DirecTV, and just recently got a DirecTV DVR with TiVo. (You're welcome, DirecTV. I used the new, more-than-a-mouthful name for it. I should get a dollar off my bill everytime I say or type it. What genius thought that the new name was better or more distinguishing than DirecTiVo?) Now, I don't want to become the 1,005th person to do an MCE vs. TiVo comparison, but some of the salient points need to be addressed.  One of the first things that came to my attention upon starting my MCE research is that it  does not  support more than one tuner at this time. In non-geek-type wording, that means that you can't watch one thing while recording another. This is not going to get it done. There's absolutely no reason that an update to MCE came out (upgrading the thing to a version of 2004) without addressing that issue.  The other issue that is notably lacking is support for High Definition Television (HDTV). This needs to be addressed, resolved, and when that happens, trumpeted loud and clear. When I say HD, I don't mean just Over The Air (OTA) HD content, either. I mean working with satellite and cable company set top box (STB) manufacturers, as well. Those that receive HD content want as much as they can get. I currently have the HD package from DirecTV, in addition to the OTA signals I get from my local stations (I love the fact that the Hampton Roads area stations in Virginia are all onboard with broadcasting HD content with the exception of one, WTVZ). I'm not sure what the answer is here. Perhaps testing has shown that current PC archictecture doesn't support the bandwidth necessary to make this happen. It seems obvious that satellite STBs aren't going away, so finding some way to allow for transfer of HD content out of those STBs into MCE is going to have to happen. Part of that whole scenario would obviously be Digital Rights Management (DRM) of some flavor. That'll be a topic for another day.  MCE is only available commercially as a complete package from a computer retailer (Dell, HP, Gateway, etc). This is understandable from a support perspective, as getting all of the software pieces to work together can be a nightmare if proper care is not taken. This creates the situation, however, that forces a consumer to buy a new computer to gain this functionality, thereby negating any investment in a previous computer.  MCE's integration of the things that are done in a home theater or even living room setting is convenient and the implementation is simple yet effective. Seemingly unfortunately for Microsoft, however, is the fact that other companies and/or initiatives ( urlLink Frey Technologies' SageTV 2.0 , urlLink Snapstream's Beyond TV/Beyond Media , as well as the open source urlLink myHTPC ) have caught on to this, and do not require a completely new computer purchase to achieve similar functionality.  Microsoft has announced  urlLink Media Center Extenders , which very well could put MCE on the road to stardom, but without addressing at least the two main issues I've listed above, Microsoft is going to add fantastic functionality without enabling the current technologies that could make MCE truly shine today. Being a geek at heart, I want it all.  So, c'mon, Microsoft, make MCE innovative. Extend the technology, but don't forget what you are extending off of.

      Cirque du Soleil. It's an amazing experience. I've been hooked on it for years. If you are unfamiliar with any of the Cirque du Soleil shows, take a few minutes one day, turn to the Bravo channel, and watch some of the most skilled circus-type performers work their magic while a stunning soundtrack accompanies and accentuates their awe-inspiring actions. (That last sentence is brought to you by the word alliteration. Alliteration: it's how you start words with the same sound. Don't think that'll catch on quite as well as those "Verb" commercials.)  Cirque du Soleil now has a show that is specifically created for television, called Cirque du Soleil: Solstrom. This show has no character dialog or voiceovers, and yet somehow conveys an entire storyline in an hour-long episode. I am  blown away by the talent of the writers, directors and editors. The camera-work, if not revolutionary, is creative and captures the essence of the offbeat and perhaps slightly demented world in which the performers inhabit.  In a television world where the last big hit becomes the programming formula du jour, it is quite refreshing to see a product so bold and unapologetic being delivered to our homes.  Man, I'm such a geek about Cirque du Soleil.

      So, what is it about some repair companies that they feel that they can treat you like an idiot?  I was having some issues taken care of that I had experienced with my 50" Samsung HLN507W DLP television. I identified these two problems very specifically, and Samsung was more than willing to do what it took to get my television fixed. Being a large company, they use local companies to be their authorized service centers. The company that is local to me has at least one and possibly more than one technician that needs to learn the art of dealing with the customer.  My mother was watching Xander as she does during the week when they picked my television up from my house. The guy(s) basically told my mother that I didn't know what I was talking about, at which point my mother rather vehemently set them straight. Go mom! Samsung, who was continually great about this whole process, had made sure that the company had the necessary parts on hand to repair my television immediately.  Skip to the end, the technician shows up with my television, and proceeds to question why I even cared about one of the issues that I had fixed. He proceeded to talk out of his ass (wait, this isn't a Jim Carrey movie), which both amused and irritated me. Why did this guy care? What was he proving? It made him look like an idiot, and for no good reason. What did he have to gain? Do some people really need that little ego stroke?  But hey, my TV is back! Yay!

      Lacy has been told by the Salem High School English department chair that she was the first teacher that was thought of for a new position as the Performing Arts Academy English instructor. She was then offered the job, which is what she wanted, so how about that?  Just wanted to brag. I'm so proud of her! /sniffle

      Xander was just over 6 months old when Mother's Day rolled around. Pictures of him taken for that special day can be found at  urlLink Lacy's personal site  [members.cox.net].  Man, he's growing so fast. He currently has 6 teeth in, at 6 and a half months old. His latest measurements when at the doctor showed that he was 29 inches long and weighed 20 pounds. He was 6 months and almost a week old at that time. According to the  urlLink United States Clinical Growth Charts  [www.cdc.gov] he is statistically in the top 3rd percentile of infants height- and weight-wise at his age. Said in another way, 97% of babies are statistically smaller than he is at his age. That all being said, it all amounts to nothing more than curious fact, as the clinical findings show that placement on the scale does not predict height or weight when full-grown.

      So, I've recently considered getting a  urlLink Chrysler 300C  [chrysler.com]. It would be a significant commitment financially, but this car has really gotten my attention. Something about the styling, the presence, the attitude of it is really appealing to me. That, or it's really ugly, and I'm an idiot.  It really seems like a great combination of family car and affordable luxury. Or a really poor choice in personal fiscal policy.  How does one balance between their inner geek yearning for new toys with their little voice that sees the potential frivolity in any major acquisition?  Also, anyone have any opinions on the car?

      In the beginning, there was nothing. Wait, you've heard that one before.  I plan to update this with my thoughts, observations, and amusing anecdotes about my life, family, and hobbies. We'll see how this goes.
