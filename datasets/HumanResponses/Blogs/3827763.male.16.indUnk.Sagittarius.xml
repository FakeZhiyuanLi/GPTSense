      Alright...last night I went to hang out w/ Jolenes bodacious bod and, of course, Jolene (who herein is refered to as Jo) And if you know Jo (and if you dont then just do what I do, and pretend you do so everyone thinks your more popular than you really are) then, you know Jo is a pretty laid back, as close to perfectionist as one can get w/out being one, kinda girl. (with a killer ass to boot) Well, let me paint the picture for ya. Give you the 411. Give you the senario. Tell you what happened. (now that Im out analogies for that Ill get to the point) Ok, well, all last night Jo continued to do things that she would never do, such as, A) mispronounce and misread words that should have been very easy for her. Ex. mistake the word tampon for condom? (that was weird Jo, seriously) B) randomly "zone out" and tell the person talking to her that she wasnt listening and that they needed to repeat themselves. (it was kind of aggrivating to have to repeat every other thing I said to the woman) and finally C) laugh at every dumbass thing I had to say and eventually kill it (I mean I know Im funny but sheesh) So, being in this situation, I thought, "well, maybe shes drunk, or high, or a combonation of the two" but Jo assured me that nothing could be further from the truth. (I didnt and still dont beleive her) So, naturally being me I (for lack of a better word or phrase) "tried to get in her pants" (Ok, fine, its true. I was trying to get in her pants but what can you do?...lol...j/k) But, since shes Jo, and Im (for lack of a better phrase because of the language/phrase restrictions on this site) "Dan" nothing I tried worked, and so I left Jo's learning a very valuable lesson. Even when Jo is high/drunk/high and drunk, shes still on her toes and that I will never get laid so....I think Im just gonna go kill myself and if you feel you can save me, go ahead and try.....in gods name we pray-Amen P.S._____if your not Jo, and your trying to save me, dont waste you breath, only her sexy, bodacious bod can save me now.

      Alright, heres my senario...Justin and I went on vacation w/ his parents for a week to arkansas and found that there are nothing but imbreds there...and you can tell who is and isn't imbred by the amount of hicken accent in their voice. Not only were we surrounded by hicks and imbreds all week but we found that we do not feel we should sin anymore, and heres why. The complex was completly idle to anything and everything, so in order to do anything you had to drive anywhere from half an hour to an hour to do something so Justin and I spent the week working out, playing pool, and sitting in the sauna. If you ever been in a sauna youll understand but otherwise youll be completely lost. (not really,&nbsp;I just like to say things so your like "then why the hell am&nbsp;I reading this?) When you sit in a sauna all you can do is think about how hot it is, but you dont want to&nbsp;get out because then your considered the weakest person in there and you dont want that, no no. So you sit in the sauna for more than half an hour until Justin and I both look at each other and say, simaltaniously "Damn, its hot, lets get the hell out of here" and so we leave. If a sauna is anything compared to hell then I shall no longer commit any sins or be a bad person. (we all know thats not true, I can't live w/out making the occasional smart ass comment, or being just plain mean to Justins girlfriend) But,&nbsp;I figure that if i can sit in a sauna for half an hour and then, eventually get used to it,&nbsp;I can do the same in hell. (I know its a horrible thing to say, and I'm willing to bet that many of you will tell me I'm not going to hell because all in all im a decent person, but if you really think about it, its true....I've earned myself a one way ticket to hell years ago and since no one at the front desk will refund my money I'm kinda stuck w/ the ticket and thus I'm going to go to hell and get my moneys worth) In gods name we pray...amen

      Ok...in this entry im suppose to apologize to Justins Wench (who herein is reinstated as Barbara Lee*Ann Walker)(yes, i know i mispelled Lee but i dont care because I'm going to spell it how I wanna on my blogger, so take that)So, for the record I'm writting this to apologize to Barbara, so here goes. I'm sorry, I love you barbara, but my love for you is separated by a fine line drawn by Justin, and since hes not good at a lot of things the line is kinda crooked, and not very straight, maybe a little wavy, and you can tell where he lifted his pencil to take a short break. And so I go out of my way to find those small gaps and squeeze through them so I can make fun of you, but I always forget how helpless you are. Your like a little midget trying to reach for something thats on top of the fridge and you can't find your long stick anywhere, so you cant do anything about it until someone tall comes along and gets it for you, but since your a midget you know no one is coming and you begin to accept your fate as being screwed for the rest of your life. And for this, Barbarbara, I am sorry. But, honestly, do you think im so cold hearted that I would seriously go out of my way to create a hell on earth just for you? Get over yourself, I have many people on my list that are way ahead of you like Santa Clause (that bastard never gave me anything I wanted) and the Tooth Fairy(I ripped every baby tooth from my mouth, and for what? A DOLLAR! WHAT A BITCH!)And then theres G.I. Joe, all seven of the dwarfs, Dorthy from The Wizard of Oz, anyone who works for Coca Cola, Pepsi, or Microsoft, then you sweetheart. I can't beleive you would be so conceited as to think I would actually drop everything just for you, geez, the hell is your problem.  In god's name we pray-Amen

      When you break up with someone you really truly care about, it's not the emotions and feelings for that person that make you so upset you just can't seem to stop crying, no no. It's the secrets. Now, now, hear me out, and just think about it, and you'll see that I'm right. The person your dating is usually someone that you can trust with almost anything, and thus you tell them everything. Consider it. When you start dating someone you tell them everything because you want to know everything about you and you want to know everything about them. And so, you tell them things that a lot of people don't know and you trust them not to tell anyone about it. But then it happens, you break up and you wonder if he/she will try to get back at you by announcing your secrets over the loud speaker at school and find that a year at new directions was worth every bit of it just to ruin your life. But just remember....even if this did happen, you should have enough dirt on them to "return the favor" or, as I like to say, retaliate. (Ahhhhh...the sweet sweet taste of revenge. The only thing in this world thats low in calories without that horrible after taste, yuck.) Or, you could live your life like Justin, Rayman and I do, and just live your life like an open book and let everyone be able to read it. (As long as they return it within a week or pay the overage fees. I mean if your not done, keep it a little longer and finish, just as long as your able to pay the fee. Cuz if you don't I will bring you down, I will bring you down to China Town) In god's name we pray-Amen

      So, I'm not perfect, sue me. Not all of my blogger entries are goin to be golden and "up to par." I'm not here to entertain you!!! Well, not yet anyways. So, out of the kindness of my heart, im righting a slight retraction to my previous entry entitled "The luck of the French" Contrary to what most people say, think and know about the French, I must say that not all French people "suck" or "are crap" (I hope your happy now Vicki, I'm going to a lot of trouble to right this retraction) But, I refuse to retract any previous statements about a Barbara Lee*Ann Walker (from here in will be refered to as Justins wench) and Haltom, because anyone who knows Justins wench and or Haltom knows that I speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.(so help me God) When Haltom actually becomes an all around decent school with winning teams and skinnier security guards then well talk about a retraction about that comment but I fear my comment on Justins wench shall and will never change. (Did I say fear, I meant know and with every commanding bone in my body will try to create a hell on earth for Justins wench, j/k) But, in conclusion I apologize to those closest to the site...and i naturally assume that since no one ever leaves comments (except Vicki) that she is the only person I am apologizing to, and so, to Vicki, I say I'm sssssssssss.....I'm sssssssrr......what I'm trying to do is apoloooooooooo......ok look....i cant do it....the French suck....I'm sorry but they do....how do you not back up the country that saved your sorry back side not once but twice in both world wars??? I'm sorry Vicki, its official the French suck, and if you want to argue this to me get as many people as you want to leave me threatening comments to this site and tell me how I'm going to die a horrible, torturing French death. In gods name we pray-Amen

      I know what your thinkin. "Its the luck of the Irish, not the French. The French suck" and to this i agree, but when refering to my luck with the ladies i have no choice but to refer to my luck as crappy. You know, its French, its crap. To those who dont know, my last girlfriend was my freshman year at Haltom (just like the French amd Barbara Lee*Ann Walker, Haltom is crap as well) in April, 2003, so I've been single for over a year now. This is because of my crappy luck with girls. I had many chances to date very attractive girls but somehow end up getting screwed in the end.(and not in a good way)Every time I would start talkin to a girl something in my life would happen and I would end up either having to break up with her, stop talking to her, or she decides that what I've done is so foul that it dare not be mentioned on this hurr site. (Like when Justin stuck his head in the freezer *shudder*)And now i leave you with the moral of this hurr tale. Always remember, you cant bribe a politician with less than a $1000. In gods name we pray-Amen

      Ok...look...im at justins house and its about 2:39 in the morning, everyone is sleeping and im here on justins computer talkin to people(shout out to michelle and leslie) and not even attempting to do anything productive. Basically just sit here on what is now my wide rear end, and hope to god that no one wakes from the loud clack clack clack of my godly typing skills. And to top it all off the only thing illuminating the entire house is the eeire(if this word is mispelled i blame the one and only michelle and i emplore you to do the same) glow of the computer screen, and im afraid to turn it off for two reasons. 1)im afraid of the dark and dont like what i cant see and 2)im always worried im going to try and fall my bed (the futon) and miss hitting my head on the metal poles and giving myself a concussion and falling into a deep coma and not awaking until all those close to me are dead, and to later find out that my parents blamed justins parents for the whole incident and sued them for so much money that they had to sell their house and live on the streets for the rest of thier life while my family lived it up on wallstreet (its the only expensive street I've ever heard of, its almost 3 in the morning, what do u want?) and now justins family cant affort to even come visit me anymore and then i just out live everyone because my family pays to have me cryogenically frozen until there is a cure to bring people right out of a coma and i end up just like Fry on Futurama (cartoon network, mon-thur at 10pm)and end up the dumb ass on some ship that delivers crap all over the galaxy until one day my stupidity kills us all. But other than that, its mostly cuz im too lazy. Yea, i know what ur thinkin...."Dan...Lazy...NOOOOOO!!!!" but its true ladies and gentleman...its true.                              in gods name we pray-Amen

       OK...so for those of you who know me...im 16 and im a horrible driver...and for those of you who dont know me...IM 16 AND IM A HORRIBLE DRIVER. I say this because 5 days after i got my license i was on my way home and ran up the curb blew out both passanger side tires and bent my dad's $500 hydrolic car jack, but being the genius that I am (yea right) i managed to sound very distraught when telling my parents and was able to keep my car and license without so much a paying a dollar for the expenses. This all took place on May 29, 2004. And as if this werent bad enough. Just the other day (dated July 1, 2004) i backed out of my best friends driveway and into the brick mail box of the wench across the street. My original decision was to get the hell out of there and never return, but being me and seeing an older male watch me do the deed and then drive off i decided to return tell this god forsaken queen of the black lagoon and figure out a way to replace it. And i know what your thinking. Your probably thinking "small truck vs. a brick mail box...he probably just took a chunk out of it." Ahhhh...but if only it was that simple, but no. I demolished this colored concrete....thing...with one foul swoop of my mighty GM produced vehicle. My truck suffered minor damage but im afraid my fathers wallet will not be the same after this incedent. But with my luck this incident does not stop here, oh no. You see, when i drove off i ended up driving around the block and because of this, our demon of the story decided to call the "law enforcements" (if you can even call them that around here) to have them tell me to give her my phone number and insurance information. Gee officer, did it take most of that half a dozen donuts you ate this morning to conjure up enough mind power to figure that one out dumb ass!!! But, once again, I returned home and conjured up my ingenius so that my parents pay for it all and I suffer minimal damage (much like my car)

      Alright...for the last week or so, Ive been filling out job applications at random places (I say random places, because everywhere I go no one is hiring) I ask if they're hiring and I hear one of the following responses. A)No, but were always taking applications B)You have to be 18 to work here or C)Hell no, now get the F*#k out of my store! (actually, that last one never happened but if it did I would laugh my ass off) For the story that goes w/ section A....here it is....I keep goin to different places but they keep telling me the same thing...."No, but were always taking applications, would you like one?" and so I say sure take one and as soon as my hand touches that application and were both holding on to it, I see it. "The Look" And if youve ever been looking for a job before, you know what this look is. Its that look they give you and the guys thinkin quietly to himself "Were never gonna call this guy, just because I feel like being an ass and Naa Naa Naa" As for part B...here goes...I go to EB Games...(similar to Game Stop but not near as good) and the guy says "How old are you?" I reply and tell him Im 16 and he says "You have to be 17 to work here" WHAT THE HELL IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 16 AND 17??? A YEAR!!! WTF!!! Now if he was to say "you have to be 18 to work here" I could understand, because 18 your a legal adult but there is no difference between 16 and 17 except the fact that 17 is one year more than 16 and that my friends is f*#ked up. And, finally, story C was completely made up but i always thought it would be funny to go into some chinese restaraunt or something and ask the manager for a job application and hes a chef behind the counter and is like "no opening, you get out, get out my restraunt" then leaps over teh counter and chases me out w/ his knife flailing about screaming things in chinese at me. I, personally would laugh my ass off (even when I take the ass hole to court and sue his slanted eye, sideways vagina ass for all hes worth) In gods name we pray-Amen
