      What's up friends?  How was your memorial day weekends?  Mine was not so good.  Why? Obviously because of my missing eyeball.  I'm sorry but you don't just get used to it right away!  I get to thinking about the eyeball again and again.  No one should have to deal with a missing eye, and it makes me feel sorry for veterans who have lost their eyes due to war in Vietnam etc.  But at least they are getting checks from the government!  I don't get checks from anyone except my work, and unlike those who live in the barracks I have a rent to pay for.  I might sound bitter but I know the truth: those people who lost their eyes sacrificed just as much as yours truly.          And here's one thing:  maybe instead of feeling sorry for myself I should feel sorry for my eye which got punctured by a straw.  It wasn't my eye that was drinking and then driving or my eye that smashed into the bulldozer.  It was me who did it.  So let's say me and the eye are even, and I can live a life without it.  But... wasn't my eye suppossed to be on the lookout for things? Bulldozers are yellow and easier to see that average.   What am I talking about?!? Obviously my eye is part of me and so it's all my fault.  I promise that soon I will stop talking about my eye.  Stay tuned. Of course if you want to tell me that you want more about my eye I will tell you!

      Hello readers! I hope everyone is doing spectacular and great today.  Today I am feeling much better than I did yesterday and so I wanted to apologize for being so sad then.  I hope I didn't bore you too much, but sometimes when things are personal you want to talk about them to your friends, which we are I believe.  I feel better today because today is my first day back at work at my job as a production assistant at a small production company here in Los Angeles, California.   It is good to have something to do instead of just sitting on my bed breathing in the smell of my comforter and trying to guess what's happening on my right. Get the joke?  Because I can't see on my right. But the thing is I don't think it's as funny as you do. I'm going to go now, guys but I hope things get better!

      I just feel like there is a dark cloud around me, like a fog of darkness, and I can't see which way to go because no matter which way I go there's so much more dark cloud for me to be in so I never know if I'm going the right direction. Can you understand that?  I feel like I must be the saddest person that there is in the world ever.  I know that that is probably not true but what if it is?  It feels like it is in my heart:  I will tell you that. It was just that it was such a disaster for me to have broken up with my girlfriend that I was so sad that I drank a lot and to tell you honestly that is probably partly responsible for how I ruined my car and lost my eyeball on the straw.  So the bad things just keep adding up and the only good things that I can find are that eventually things will be better.  But I know that my eyeball will never grow back in my eye and that with not having an eye and with the scar on my eye lid that is shaped like a straw hole and without a car there is no way I can ever get Sara back.  So will it get better?  Only in that they tell me that my eyebrow will grow back soon. And to tell the facts Sara cheated on me even before I didn't have a car so I guess I wouldn't be good enough for her even if it had never happened anyway.  Can anyone have any ideas about how I can get out of this cloud?  I bet they won't work. No offense meant.

      Gosh... where to begin.  Things have not been going the greatest here at rancho steve-a-monga lately.  At all!  It's just about all I can do to get out of bed and go to the desk where this computer is and turn on the computer and open the internet and access this blog and then type something and then publish something on it. And I'm not tired from being tired from no sleep, either: I'm tired because it's hard to have only one eyeball when you're supposed to have two, and to have to face lie to everyone you meet or be a wierdo person who just talks about his glass eye. I've been talking to you for a while so I guess I can be honest to you: I don't have one of my eyebrows because of them fixing the hole where my eyeball was and a couple of guys have laughed at me because of that fact, and I just kind of wish that I didn't have to have that happen to me and didn't have to go my whole life with a scar on my eyelid (very big) and a glass eyeball and never feeling attractive to ladies. And here is why: honestly a little before I started writing this blog, [I am so sorry that I never told you this but some things are personal.]  I was broken up with my a girl that had been my girlfriend for a long time: four and a half years, which is like forever when you are young.  This is making me sad so I'll give the bigger update when I am feeling better.  Here's a thing:  since I only have one eye to cry out of I have to cry for twice as long.  That's not true really but it's an appropriate metaphor, I believe.

      Boy am I sorry for how long it has been since I communicated with you, my loyal fans.  I hope that none of you have lost interest in the intervening time in me!  They took my internet away at the hospital because I was researching something that I wasn't supossed to research and the head nurse freaked out totally. Honestly I have to tell you that I was researching suicide.  Not because I was going to do it, because that's not my style.  It's just that I am not exactly "looking" forward to a life with only one eyeball. Get the joke? "Looking."  But anyway I know it will be tough even if it is true that you can still drive with no depth perception.  The glass eye I got is blue but not blue like my real eye exactly so now I've got two different color eyes.  When I look at people now like my dad or the landlord of my apartment I feel like I am a liar.  They think they see an eyeball but what they are really seeing is glass and made of hurt.  I will often think to myself "why is it that this happened to me?" "Instead of to someone else?"  I am so young right now, and now with a false eyeball I feel like I will never be connected to a person again.  Because of the lie I tell people about my eyeball of hurt.  I don't tell them the lie, in fact I will tell them the truth, but if they just see the eye and think it is real then that is a lie in my face.  And if I am honest right away then they will think I am a wierdo for talking about my eye.   The fact is that it did not work out between me and the nurse, which makes me depressed to think about it.  And now I wonder to myself: "Is it because I'm her patient or because I do not have one eyeball?  Who knows?"  I asked her but she pretended not to hear.          Does anyone have a car that they are interested in selling?  That is another thing that will make my relationships with potential girlfriends fail before they begin, because I crashed my car to the point of it being totalled and undriveable.  That's for listening to me spill, guys.

      I have to tell you honestly: it is hard to maintain a blog properly when you have recently lost an eyeball in a car accident.  My one remaining eyeball has to work very hard, and to top it off it is watery from having to work so hard. And the thing is also that I feel unattractive with this eye bandage and with the watery other eyeball, which is sad because I have (here it comes!) a little crush on my nurse.  It got worse when they told me they had shaved my eyebrow underneath the bandage.  Literally, a person needs two eyebrows.  I know, I know, I am lucky because I am alive. But even you would be depressed if your eyelid had a strawhole in it.  I'll cheer up soon.  My dad came to visit me today.  His name is John and I had not seen him in several months.  He told me that I should cheer up soon cause at least the straw didn't reach my brain.  He's right.  More about nurse Lindsey and my dad after I eat a good meal. Until then have good times everyone.  And stay tuned.

      I have to apologize for not having written on this page for several days.  I'm sure many of you readers have been a little bit concerned about my disappearance-- that fact is I was in a terrible car accident.  And I have lost an eyeball. The left one, the one which on several occasions people have told me is prettier than the one on the right. I guess you want the details:  I drive a black honda accord and I smashed it into the side of a bulldozer.  I can't remember exactly what happened, but the nurse said the doctor told her I hit my head on the steering wheel at impact, then, unconscious, fell over across the dash and poked out my eye with a straw from a cup in the cup holder.  It was a thick pink slurpee straw, she says, which makes sense since that's the only color I ever get. When they found me I was still leaking a mixture of blood and eye-juice onto a floor mat.        So now the doctors are making me a glass eye.  You have to pay extra for blue, I guess.  I'm still at the hospital and my head hurts so bad it might crack open again.  More later!

      I don't believe in the future so much as I believe in the concept OF a future, that is, I believe that there will be, in the future, a continuing concept of the forward progression of time (at least according to our perception), by which I mean that I envision a world, much like ours, only in the future, in which people are capable of and sort of enjoy thinking about the future. I'm not saying the world of the future will be better, and I'm not saying it will be worse.  Who can tell if civilization is rising to the top of the mountain of enlightenment or sinking down, down, to be covered by the oozing slimes of disorder and misery?  No one.  But that doesn't stop people from trying to think about it now, right? And in the future it won't stop people in the future either, not even for a second as they fly around in their cars and use high tech disintegration lasers to kill each other.  I mean I think it was a philosophical person who pointed out that we can only be sure of what is happening in any given moment, and that all our memories of the past could be implanted in our heads by god or whatever.  So what's the harm of trying to figure out what's going to happen tomorrow if the day after tomorrow tomorrow will just be implanted in our heads by Jesus?  More on this in the FUTURE.  Get the joke?!

      Sorry it took me so long to get back to you about my story about my ostrich Armstrong!  Things have been really busy.  Again, I apologize.  Anyway, when I was twelve I went to an airshow in Auburn, Washington, that was very exciting for a young person like I was.  Then, on the way back, we passed an ostrich farm.  I was excited as I could possibly be. In previous times I had only seen ostriches in zoos, or on the nature shows that I watch on TV, or on other television shows that I had watched, specifically cartoons. So seeing this ostrich farm from the car was the first time I had ever seen an ostrich in real live except for the zoo.  I was stunned.  As soon as I got back to the house I went to my room and thought a lot about the ostrich.  Eventually I decided that what I wanted was to own my own ostrich.  I talked to my parents about it, and they said that I could get one if I took good care of it and never let it out of its cage. And I did, and I named it Armstrong after the cleaner.  Armstong was a very good ostrich, and we liked each other as friends.  I still have one of his feathers in a box someplace.  After a few months Armstrong died from sadness.

      The confession I have to make is that the piece below is not true.  But I will say that the story was based on a real dream I had, where people in the future really liked and respected cows, but at the same time they ate burgers.  Funny, huh?  You can see I'm sure why someone would want to write a story about what happened.  But what with the dream the real story I had dreamed hit a little too close to home.  So I switched details to be ostriches because I had a pet ostrich name Armstrong when I was a kid.  But things in my life are too busy for a telling of the "tail" of Armstong! Maybe later.

      I guess the thing I believe least about my visions of the future is how all the technology in those futuristic visions is powered by ostriches of various shapes and sizes.  Even an avowed ostrich lover like me has got to question the value of that innovation, the practicality, and if it's not practical then how can we expect the futurians to adopt it?  I know, of course, that if ostriches were somehow capable of perpetual motion or something, using them as a power source would be effective and practical, but why would such a thing be true?  One leaps to the conclusion that perhaps the presence of some religious obsession makes ostriches the future power of choice.  But in my visions there seemed to be so little ceremony present as surly workers tossed ostriches young and old into as electricity producing furnace.  I even saw young children stuff flaming baby pygmy ostriches into the back of hand-held gaming consoles-- they did it with an expertise and frequency that astonished me. As realistic as these visions were, their truth still haunts me.  I hate to betray my family and those others  who have come to believe in my future visions.  But unofficially I'm wondering if all those things I saw were just dreams.

      Well I have a few minutes so I thought I could tell you the story of how my CD player was stolen.  (If you have not read it already you should read the entry below this one for referencing). It all was when I was still in college at Whitman.  I had brought my CD player to the Improv club that I had joined for pleasure so we could listen to some music that I liked that was by an excellent musician named Drew Shoals.  We listened to it and everyone liked the music, which was played on the boom-box style CD player.  But then we went out of the place we were rehearsing to take a break and make phone calls if we had to, and when I came back the CD player was gone. It is probably needless for me to say that I didn't perform very well at improvisation that night because I was wondering what kind of world we live in that some one could just take a CD player that isn't theirs.  For a week or so after that night I wondered who it was, then because of clues I thought it might be Phillip Kopczynski, who was someone in the improv club but who I thought was a drug-user. But then the clues turned out to be fake, and so now I'm still wondering.  If one of my readers is the person who stole it, you owe me one CD player. I later bought another CD player.

      A lot of readers have been writing in to ask why this blog is called the Tiki Room, and I just want to respond to that by replying that it is called the Tiki Room because a Tiki Room is a fun place where you can go with your friends to have a few drinks, shoot the poop, and watch electric birds sing to you. I want this blog to be an open and fun environment for people to shoot poop in, (I guess especially me), and I also want it to have the same novelty as electric birds.  Hence the name: Tiki room.  Also one time a friend I have who's name is Jason (we went to the same college) once put the Tiki Room song on repeat in the CD player that I had, and it just played and played and played and it was for some reason very fun.  I don't have the CD player anymore because it was stolen. But that's a story for another day.

      The last post (below) is something I wrote together with a personal friend that I have named Eric.  Eric is a great guy that I met when we were in high school at the same high school in Everett, Washington.  He's a great writer and he gave me the idea, and then helped me out with some of the verb tenses and vocabulary choices, for the story.  The story is not based on a real thing, but rather on my imagination and partly Eric's. Eric and I no longer live in the same city, because he lives in Weed, California (no jokes! he says) where he attends the college of the Siskiyous, and I live in Los Angeles. But still we often have contact, from simple emails to an exchange of modest gifts that we have for our birthdays, which are by coincedence on the same day (September 6).  This last year he got me a small marble statue of the Egyptian Dog-man Anubis that I keep on the sill of a window, and I got him NCAA Football 2003 for X-Box which he says is great. We go really well together creatively!

      I guess I should be glad that last month I was drenched in boiling acid, stung all over my body by more than a thousand fierce killer bees, and dipped to my thighs in molten lava.  In retrospect I can almost see how the intense pain I suffered then, have suffered since, and will continue to suffer forever has given me an exciting and less naive outlook.  I see the world now as it really is: a twisted and evil place where justice plays no role, where good people who work hard to make things better are just as likely to be crushed in the hands of fate as anyone else. Knowing what I know now, would I really want to back to the way things were two months ago, when I stumbled unknowingly through existence, a moronic smile plastered on my face, my brain oblivious to the real nature of the universe?   If I press the morphine button enough, I can remember my day, that day, with ease.  And let me tell you, I regret my own innocence almost as much as I regret being in the steel plant next to the honey factory on what everyone thought was just a regular mountain.  In fact, I regret it more, sometimes. Other times, though, the thick frosting of pain and misery that accompanies  my every action makes me regret nothing but being unable to sneak quietly into heaven and throttle God. "The bees!" I would shout as I throttled. "The acid!" "The lava!"

      I collect old postcards.  Some interesting postcards I have collected include a postcard from Expo '67, and also many postcards of animals that I send to my friend Becky.  I know Becky from college.  The animal postcards that I send her have brief descriptions of the habits of the animals involved on their backs. I try to repeat some of this information in the text of the card.  Once I had three art postcards depicting the aftermath of the death of John the Baptist, in which a beautiful woman holds up his severed head.  These cards were black and white and dated from the 1920s.  I sent them all to the same person, Desi, who I also know from college.           Work today is fine.

      Hi.  My name is Stephen James Unckles and this will be my blog.  I'm 24 years old and I live in Los Angeles California.  I work at a small production company callled Dakota and I am six foot 2 inches tall.  I have blue eyes and my favorite food is Satsuma Oranges from Japan.  I like to read and write and I also enjoy hiking.  I have two degrees from Whitman College in Walla Walla Washington.  One of them is in Theatre and the other one of them is in English.  I like books that are modern and my favorite author is John  Steinbeck.  Some of my favorite TV shows include The Office, The Upright Citizens Brigade, The Daily Show, and nature shows, especially those that feature ants.  I do not have a girlfriend.   I do not have any tattoos or major body modifications, and I don't have any scars that are interesting.  When I am older I hope to live in a house instead of an apartment and have children.  I like animals, especially dogs and hymenoptera.

      I just had a realization that Kazooie is a lot like Armstrong (my pet ostrich which you may remember was from when I was a kid).  Me and Armstrong were a team in a way, just like banjo and his friend kazooie are also a team.  But kazooie is always happy, but Armstrong was very sad.   So sad that he died.

      Here's a question for everyone: why didn't anyone mention to me that there is such a thing as a sequel to banjo kazooie called banjo tooie?  I was reading the internet and found out about it recently while I was doing it. I am interested so much in continuing the adventures.  But then on the other hand I am having a some fun playing the first game still because of how great it is.  I have gotten very good at it, what I would say would be called champion-level status, and now I must admit that I can do all of rusty-bucket bay without thinking at all.  This is also true with several other levels: for instance Bubblegloop Swamp. But in comparison to Rusty Bucket Bay Bubblegloop swamp is easy as dropping a hot potato! Although i say that, I should say that once two days ago I was playing it and I almost couldn't get past the part where the gold flibbets attack you out of nowhere! And the gold ones take two times as many hits as red flibbets.  I don't know what was going on because I normally do not have a problem there, but I just couldn't do it! So I did my trick, which is to press pause and take a deep breath and have vodka and then go back to it with a cleared head. And of course it worked so perfectly.  I keep trying to decide: which one do I like better. Banjo Bear of Kazooie Bird.  Banjo is really fun, but so is the bird.  And also both of them are hilariously funny, which is something I value.  I'll keep you informed but I bet I lke them both the same amount. But what if Kazooie poked out banjo's eyeball with his beak (very sharp)? I guess I like Kazooie better because that couldn't happen to him.  Poor Banjo if that happens.  And here's something, which is that I kind of even like Gruntilda the witch (Grunty) now because she is a worthy opponent, and I appreciate that she keeps trying to stop me even though I am very good.  It is like how the roads of France are trying to stop the biker with cancer all the time. You could say that for me with my missing eyeball and what happened with Sara and "what" happened later and how Kevin doesn't answer anymore is like my personal Gruntilda or France, and I am like Banjo Kazooie and or the biker because I haven't given up and gone the extra mile, if you know what I mean.  Honestly I have to admit that lately life has been like Rusty Bucket Bay was when I first started playing it, but I have an idea: maybe life will get easier if I just keep playing it over and over and over all day for a long time and I eventually won't have to think about it.

      I have gotten some comments that I obviously was confused in the last post to have been thinking that I was watching a TV when clearly I was on the computer, but they are wrong because I knew what I was doing and because I was just saying a thing that my mom used to say in in my youth, not saying something real as if I was a TV zombie just for sitting in front of my computer/ and or Nintendo 64 that is hooked up to my television.  A computer zombie, would be more like. But FYI to the commenteers that I am not that either. You know that I love you readers because of your support, but I seriously wish that some of you would just come to understand the fact that you don't know all about me.  I have feeling which I don't even share sometimes.  I want to but I have so many and I can't get them out and sometimes it has been recommended that I just try to forget! Do you get it?  So don't just jump on me like what has happened before, if you don't mind.  Thank you.  I don't want to be a freak-outer but you know sometimes when things have to be said?       I feel tired all of the time now, like I am carrying a heavier weight and that it makes me exhausted.  But there isn't a weight, or at least not a real wieght.  There's the worse weight of being sad about my ex-girlfriend who's name is Sara and how she doesn't even like me anymore even though it is so SAD. And Kevin is like, time to move on, Unckles.

      Hey everyone of my readers, I am sorry that it has been an entire week since the last time I wrote an update here in my blog.  I have just been so busy that I have not had time!  But honestly this blog is a priority to me because it keeps me connected to you, my friends.  I don't know where I would be right now without your support in the last couple of months.  So I assure you that I'm going to be doing a lot more of writing and a lot less of doing things that take up so much of my time. I hope no one of you readers has stopped reading because of the break because I need your support, guys.            One of the things that I won't be doing anymore now since I have decided to get off my duff is to play this game named Banjo Kazooie which I have for the nintendo 64 system. It is really fun.  You are a bear named Banjo and he has a friend who is a bird named Kazooie.  You run around all the time to find feathers, and the are different colors which give you different powers.  What has happened in the story is that Gruntilda the witch has stolen away your sister Tootie, who is also a bear.  So you have to rescue her by getting the feathers and by getting Jiggies which are pieces of jigsaw puzzles.   What I want to know is why did Banjoo decide to live in an area where there is a witch anyway? Am I right?  All jokes aside seriously you have to get her, and it is really fun. One part that is hard (there are many of those parts) is Rusty Bucket Bay, where you swim around.  And there is also a voodoo man that can change you into different animals.  For instance: a bee or walrus. Also: and alligator named Chompy. Kazooie learns to fly and he can shoot eggs, and that is so fun. I moved my TV into my room.              Kevin, who regular readers know as my monitor,  is now only coming over for me during the day and during the times that I call him and tell him to come.  He's such a good guy.  Once he brought me fries from a restaurant he had been eating at when I called, and though some people might say that's not a big deal I say it is because he didn't have to do it and because I'll take what I can get, people.  He says that soon he won't be allowed to come over as much, and I say that will be a bad time for yours, truly.  Although you may remember from before that I didn't like him, I underwent a change and have completely changed my mind.  He's just looking out for my interests.  To tell the truth he's probably the best friend that I have now (don't be jealous readers) and I know that I'll miss him so much.  I don't need that. But he says he won't be able to even talk to me at all soon and I'll have to be on my own again.  I can do it I'm sure.  But I don't want to.            What's good about Banjo Kazooie is that its two dimensional reality, so I don't need to see out of my missing eyeball whatsoever.  Also the graphics are pretty good. I was worried that when I beat it the first time I would be sad because I wouldn't want to play it anymore but it turns out the game is just as good or is better when you are playing it for the second time around because you know the tricks, and that is just as true for additional times. I've got to get to cleaning my room now, because this place is a mess.  As my mom would say right now, "it looks like a festival came through here!"  and "Don't be a TV zombie, Steve."

      How is everyone today out there?  I am fine.  I have to say that I'm so sorry I haven't given you guys the scoop on what's up in my life for several days.  This is because of how the eyehole where my real eyeball used to be and where my fake eyeball now is got infected with bacteria and I went to see the doctor.  He told me that the eyehole with bacteria could be dangerous to me. Then he took out my fake eyeball and filled the eyehole with antibiotic medicine paste.  So anyway then he said that my other eyeball might be in trouble from the other gone eyeball, so he put an antibiotic salve on the eyeball I have left and said that I should wear this patch for a couple of days.  So for a couple of days it was as if I had lost both my eyeballs, but that wasn't the truth really.  Boy having no eyeballs is tough! I would think if I really didn't have any, because you can't see anything until you die.  It just shows how grateful I am for the eyeball that I do have.  So anyway now you see why I couldn't write down the things I do over the weekend. Because I couldn't see a computer screen to do the typing.      I want to say though that even though having a monitor watching you is bad because he stops you from doing fun things like baking vegan cookies or going on a boat trip, it is also good because he can help you do things that are needed.  For example I was really glad that Kevin (Kevin is the name of my monitor for newer readers. He said don't say his last name.) was there to help me when I was not seeing because of the bandages.  He helped me do many things: for instance eat some ribs. Also it is very difficult to walk around when you can't see, which Kevin helped me do, because you run into things.  But you will be happy to know that now I can see out of my eye very well, which of course is overjoying, and I'm really looking forward to the future in a way.             My eyebrow looks similar to normal now, and I have trimmed my remaining eyebrow a little so they would match closer,  so I'm hoping that the couple of people who think it's funny will stop.  I did have thick eyebrows before but I think I look good now so who knows? Maybe I will keep them how they are.  But what do I care because I don't even trust ladies anymore besides my eyeball. And if you can't trust ladies you are lucky if you are missing one eyeball and have one eyebrow because you will not be tested as often, although Kevin says it's possible, and so you will be betrayed less often.  Hey did anyone know that I have bought a car? It is a used car and is a black honda.  I cannot drive it yet but it was only 400 dollars from Kevin's friend named Bryan.  Remember to not drink and drive! everyone.

      Boy oh boy what a loony I sounded like yesterday! I'm sorry that I went so nuts on all of you.  I had a teacher once that said I sometimes get passionate! And I specifically owe an apology to my monitor Kevin:  he is not such a bad guy and he has my interests in his heart, and he also knows a lot about women and how to relate to them.  He has a girlfriend named Margot.  I have not met her and Kevin says it would be better if I did not ever, but I bet she's a special one.  I hope she doesn't cheat on Kevin.  I really do.  Being cheated on can really make a guy feel very sad.  Take it from me, although please don't ask for the details.  Honestly the details are that my last girlfriend cheated on me even though she said she loved me and we had been together for a long time and lately I have been really wishing that my heart would stop stop stop beating. You know? I'm glad I can share with you, readers.  I only have one eyeball now, and the other one is glass, and it makes it hard, I guess, to get a good grip on what is going on outside the world besides me.  Sometimes I think having one eyeball that's real is a curse, but sometimes I can kind of see how it might maybe be a blessing, like when in makes me look at myself to see how maybe my vision is limited. My gone eye is mostly healed now, but the part where the straw went through my eyelid is very red now and there's a little hole it it like the size of  a sucker handle, and you can see the black of my fake pupil right through when I close my eyelid.  If you want me to post a picture of myself don't bother asking, because I won't.  Thank you.

      Hey here's a question for my readers that I have:  have you ever had a monitor that was a jerk?  I have to say that my monitor Kevin is a total jerk.  He's the first monitor that I've ever had, so I don't know if all monitors are jerks or if only my monitor Kevin is a jerk by himself? What are your thoughts/comments?  Don't think I don't know how monitors are rare!! Because I know. But I bet that among someone of our readers there is someone who has had a monitor before. What was he or she like? I hope that your monitor at the time was not Kevin.  He is a REAL shitbag.      Here's why: the fact is that Kevin (my monitor) has been really keeping me from doing the things that I like to do.  For example he will not let me bake in my oven, which is bad because I love to make vegan cookies.  And the oven is Electric, not gas!  And also he won't let me go on a floor that is above a second floor.  That is mean! when some of the best stuff is on second floor. And he took my belts away.  He is always saying that he is my friend and that he has my best interests at heart but I can feel him watching me and it makes me sick!!! I hate him, and I can only say that because he let me say that while standing right behind me right now.  Hey Kevin you are a jerk and I hate your stupid t-shirts and I wish you would just go away and die!! And I don't need you because I am FINE now and it doesn't matter what you think!! and I am a grown man so it doesn't matter what they say about me.  Can you read this, you stupid KEVIN! I am fine and I WISH YOU would LEAVE me alone.  Got it?      Readers guess what?  He is still here and he won't leave and instead he just copied down what I'm writing in his gay yellow journal of LIES!  Kevin you call that job security??? I call it go to hell and leave me ALONE!!!!!!       I am glad I have you, readers, like you CHRIS E., who are my total friends and who I can really trust to not judge me like certain monitors I know.  Judging is what hurts, and even if I only have one eyeball I can see that.  Anyone can see that, even if they had no eyeballs at all to see out of. Get it?  KEVIN TAKE A LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND SEE YOURSELF FOR WHO YOU ARE!!! AN ASSHOLE IS IT!!!

      Hey guys.  I'm back out of the hospital again.  Last week just after I posted that last message I fell really hard in my bathroom and injured my wrists very badly.  But I feel better now so lets not talk about it or comment about it at all to me. Thank you.  How is everyone doing?  I am keeping it together now.  As time passes I'm getting more and more used to the fact that I don't have one eyeball.  Am I really a face liar for only having one eye?  Or a wierdo?  My monitor says no I'm neither because people should just get used to my missing eye.  And they should.  Whether or not it was my fault or Sara's fault. I just miss her is all. I miss her like I miss my eye.  I'm sorry I waited so long to post.  I hope no one's "alienated."  But the point is that the rough times are hopefull nearly over.  My monitor says that their are certain women who could love a guy with just one eye.  Where are they, is the question that I have.

      Last night I was asleep and I had this dream as follows: I was in bed asleep (in the dream although also in true life!) and I was in my room (old room at college). I was just asleep and I could see myself being asleep so peacefully when suddenly I saw someone from above pour a big white bucket of blood into the room from above.  That's when I suddenly realized that there was no ceiling and then suddenly realized that someone else was pouring a big bucket of blood from the other side into the room.  And I saw myself sleeping  peacefully in the room, and suddenly I realized that the first person who had poured the blood in from above was now pouring another big bucket of blood in, and so was the second person doing it again. But I didn't even wake up from the sound, and the the people above the ceiling at the tops of the walls (their faces were not able to be seen even a little) just kept pouring in so many of the buckets of blood.  And that blood I could tell was so thick and cold, and so red that it was shiny even in my room which was dark.  And, pretty soon, the blood kept rising up until it had reached the edge of my bed. And I could see that the blood was rising and I knew that I would wake up when the blood touched me, because it was so cold like the ice water deep underground in an under ground water cave that's too cold even for blind fish to live there, and thick too.  But then when it touched me I didn't wake up and I just kept sleeping in peace and pretty soon after that they just kept pouring in more blood.  And I was trying to wake up. But even though I tried I couldn't wake my self up.  Then they kept pouring and soon the blood was to my ears.  And then over my mouth. But then I didn't drown because I was asleep, or get any of the blood in me, because of how peacefully I slept. But you know I didn't want to freeze either so I screamed out: to wake up wake up wake up me! But the sleeping me couldn't hear me because of the blood! for a long time until my whole room was so full and it smelled and the ice blood covered everything up to the top of the walls.  Suddenly I woke up! and I was swallowing and gasping  the cold thick blood into my lungs and it went into my ears and all over me and into my eyehole and I choked on blood. And when I woke up I vomited and vomited and vomited and vomited and my room was pitch dark like it had been in the blood.  Needless to say I am not going to sleep again for a while!

      It has probably never happened to you but I get so tired of just having one eyeball now.  Every time I look in a mirror and before I go to sleep often I can't help but think about how I will never have the right number of eyeballs in my face again, and that it is so sad to think about.  When people have a broken leg they can think of course:  my leg will soon heal up and I will be better and will have some fun.  But when I lost my eyeball I lost it forever no matter how much I want it back, because of my drinking et cetera, and it hurts to know that.  Even if one day I have such a perfect liar eye that no one ever says that I am a wierdo, and even if my eyebrow grows back correctly, and even if I am happy again through something like winning something or other luck, I'll never ever have an eyeball in addition to the one I currently have. And I asked about transplants so don't say it.  There's a piece of what is me missing, you know? I used to be so happy I can remember it easy, and now it's like all that happiness that I thought was in me was in my eyeball and it slurped out into the slurpee cup.  Or maybe all the happiness in me was like: I need a pair of eyeballs to work and not just one eyeball.               And did you ever think how hard it would be to clean up for example an apartment if you only had a single eyeball.  I bet it would be hard because you can't see as well, and you could easily stubb your fingers on floor when you were picking something up or cut yourself on broken glass. And so that's what I've been thinking about lately, readers of this site, which is tough.

      I have had so many fun adventures since the last time that I wrote something to you on this blog page that I bet you will hardly be able to believe them at all.  But I will swear that they are all true.  One thing that was adventurous was that I went to Del Taco to get some food because I am a big fan of their soft tacos (inexpensive) and because of promotion I won a free coke on my next visit.  And it's even without purchase.  Of course I bet there are some people who would say that a regular coke is no big deal, but I'd be willing to bet that they don't like cola as much as me and also I would bet that they win things all the time.  And FYI I don't win things too often, if you get my meaning. Second I went and saw the movie Spiderman: Spiderman 2 which is an adventure in itself.  And I said to the popcorn woman:  hey can I get butter and she said to respond: of course and then I said:  I hope the Spiders in this movie aren't scary because I am afraid of spiders (not true because they are nature's bug eaters) and she laughed so much.  There aren't reaI spiders in the movie besides Spiderman, which is why that is funny.  I didn't see her again but I have thought about it a lot, you know?  And then the third adventure which was that Kevin came over to my house to pick up a form paper and we got to a conversation and it turns out that he has a new girlfriend now named Margot. That is a good name for someone in my opinion.  We were also going to have some beers but he had to take off to Margot's house and he says I am maybe drinking too many, which is of course something silly because how could he know how much I drink if he never comes over anymore?  Answer that, Kevin, because now I guess it's none of your business. But I miss my old girlfriend, even though she is so mean and doesn't call me even though she was the one to break my heart and not the other way around, as if I broke her heart.  Adventures are fun but it is hard to be alone and have just one eyeball. Even when you win something.            Seriously this has been fun but there is a bear and his friend a bird that are calling my name right now, and if you don't know their names they are Banjo and Kazooie/Armstrong.

      A happy fourth of July and independence day to all of you readers out there!  Today is a good day for everyone to celebrate how good America is, and how it is the best country in the land in a way, because today celebrates the day that we stopped being under the command of the british people, King George.  Don't take it badly, though, because I'm not going to leave my apartment today because of a fear that I have: a firework going off in my remaining good eyeball.  I only have one good eyeball because of something that happened earlier this year, and so if a bottle rocket or sparkler or flower went off in my remaining good eyeball I would be blind.  And read up on it: that happens all the time.  Although I have to admit honestly that I don't know exactly where I would go if I was going to leave the house.  But to celebrate I'm going to have a personal feel-better party, which is fun and which I made up myself.  You should try it.  Every time you get a jiggy piece you have a drink from your bottle of vodka, and then everytime Kazooie reminds you of a pet you had once you take a drink from a beer, and if you play all night because you can't sleep even though you're so drunk when you beat Gruntilda the Witch then you drink everything that you have left. Note: this game also requires a bucket.

      You never know how much more fun banjo kazooie can be until after you've realized that one of the characters is like a pet ostrich that you had. It was so fun that I played the game all through last night till now,  but instead of saying kazooie I would say Armstrong. I wish that there was a heaven for ostriches so that Armstrong could be there to watch me play Banjo Kazooie down here. But actually if there was that then Armstrong would be in hell down below, because how he died was committing suicide.  It's a very sad story, and I am too busy because I have to clean my room to tell it to you right now.  And actually it's so sad that I don't want to tell it. I'm just going to play a little more of Banjo Kazooie then really clean my room, which actually has gotten dirty along with the rest of my apartment since I got in the accident, and I just haven't had time to do dishes lately.  I am betting that if someone were ever to come over they maybe say that "this place smells." I'm used to it but I understand.  Of course if someone were to ever come over I would say that they should be nicer because they should think about what happened, and I bet that they would also have such a messy place if what has happened to me had happened to them.  I don't have energy to go over it with you right now, people, so all the new readers just read what happened before, and then you will understand it.  What happened was my now ex-girlfriend Sara cheated on me and then she broke up and then I accidentally crashed my car into a big thing which means that I don't have an eye, so then I did something and I needed a monitor and now not even the monitor is my good friend because he says I need to have personal healing area without him.  Would you have energy to clean up some spilled stew if that had happened to you?  I bet you wouldn't if that happened to you even have the energies to put a washcloth on it, which I did after a bit.  And here's one thing else: I am missing one eyeball now so I feel like a freak.  I don't believe in Jesus but he said that you shouldn't judge or you'll be judged then.  Of course I'm only saying that to the readers who hassle and not the readers who support.

      Here is an interesting fact that I bet you don't know:  the people at the place where they give dogs away won't just give a dog away if you ask them to certain people.  Myself included. So, if you want to get a dog from them, go ahead and try it, but for certain people it will not work. And DID I MENTION THAT THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME WHY? WHY??! wouldn't they?  I don't know, because they wouldn't TELL ME WHY.  I got so mad because I had ALREADY picked out a dog that was brown which is absolutely my favorite color with dogs. I couldn't decide if I was going to name it Barky (this name has a sad history for me but hey why not embrace it to make it less hurtful?  More on the sadness from that story at a later date) or if I should name it Caliope, which is a fun thing that makes music, just like a dog only with growling instead of music, or Banjo. I was wondering if the fact that I didn't have a name for the dog was what was the thing stopping them from just giving me it already, but I asked them and they said that was not it.  And I was wearing big sunglasses that I got at Rite Aid so if you are thinking that she saw my fake eyeball and that was the reason, then may I suggest that you get a clue. Besides that people with one eyeball are good dog owners because they love their dogs more because they are so very sad at all times.  The people who work at the free dog place just don't GET IT!!          So I say who cares about it, you can get a dog any place, like for instance at the store at the mall.  And the dogs there are smarter of course than reject dogs no one wants.  Wouldn't you be amazed if you were to see a dog that could play a video game for the N64 all by itself?  Maybe not very well but could play it? I know it would take training. But if the dog loves me enough he'll work hard and figure it out and we can play together and amaze people so much.  Of course I am the first player, because after all I'm the master of the dog, but the dog is second in the team.
