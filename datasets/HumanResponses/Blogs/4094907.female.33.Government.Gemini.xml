      This Blog thing is like free therapy to me.  I used to keep a journal but since I’ve been married I haven’t kept it up.  I just never seemed to have time to take pen in hand and keep it up.  Besides, my spelling is atrocious!  I don’t know what I would do without spell check.  So, let me sit on the couch and free my memories.  I think this helps to let out some of my child hood pains that seem to control me now later in life.  How odd that I choose a public forum in which to do this.  Not so public though, I’m guessing no one really reads this, but it gives me a place for me to be completely honest with myself and I can come read it anytime.  I don’t have to worry about will my husband read my journal.  Not that I have anything to keep from him, I just don’t want to think that I have to edit my writing just in case I have a feeling or two I want to express without expressing it to him.  My husband is a very sensitive guy.  It’s one of the things I love about him.  But sometimes I think thoughts that would hurt his feelings and I don’t dare express them to him.  My reason for this is just that it is usually small petty things that would never make me love him any less.  There just is no reason in the world to say things that are going to make him feel bad.  Saying it doesn’t make me feel better.  I guess this is one of my vices from when I was a child.  My mother was a very harsh woman, to say the least.  Like so many of us I was abused as a child.  Not as harshly as some of our children today.  My mother only left bruises she never broke anything; the only thing she ever scarred was my way of thinking.  If you read my first blog you know I have a serious weight problem.  So, let me lie down on this couch and talk about one of my early memories.  I grew up in a small beach town in California called Shell Beach.  It’s a beautiful place on the central coast.  I was a very lean child.  I spent my evenings out in the front yard doing gymnastics.   But both my mother and step father worked.  My mother only let us leave the house if one of them were home so they knew where we were at all times.  This posed a problem during the summer.  Neither my sister, who is four years older than me, nor I were allowed to leave the house all day until my mother came home which was about 5pm.  So from about 3rd grade which was the time my mother started leaving us home alone without a sitter on up through high school we spent our summers laying around the house watching TV or laying out in the sun in the back yard.  Sure we would take turns sneaking out.  One would stay home to answer the phone when my mother would call to check up on us while the other would walk to the beach for a couple hours, or sneak to the store to buy crap food that we would eat while lazing around on our asses all day.  So, as you can imagine, we started getting fat.  My sister was smart.  After we would pig out she would go throw up.  She stayed farley thin doing this.  I wasn’t old enough to know to do this so I just got bigger and bigger.  My mother would come home to find me laying out in the sun in my bathing suit and would come by and pinch my stomach and make comments like, “getting a little roll here aren’t you?”  She would always make little comments like that.  Or if I reached for seconds she would say things like, “you couldn’t possibly still be hungry?”  One day when I was 11 years old my mother was in a particularly bad mood.  She was yelling at me for everything.  The messes we didn’t clean up around the house, the cost of food and how she couldn’t afford to keep feeding us at the pace we were eating, and how every time she would go to get something from the cupboard or fridge it would be gone.  She then instructed me to strip down naked and stand in front of my full length mirror and I was told to stand there for 15 minutes and think about what I was doing to my body by eating so much.  I was in tears and protesting but my mother was a very harsh, strong woman.  I had no choice other than to do it.  I found out later in my 20’s when having a heart to heart with my sister about our child hood that she had done the same thing to her.  Well mom, lesson never learned.  Look at me now, I’m all grown up and all grown out!  Guess it didn’t work.  When I look back on it it’s like she chastised me for something that she really created.  She never supported us being active.  When I was in 7th grade I wanted to try out for basket ball.  My mother told me that I couldn’t because she wanted me home right after school.  I defied her and did it anyway.  I didn’t make the team, most likely because at that point I was out of shape.   How do I keep myself from doing this to Chloe?  I see myself doing it a bit with my husband.  Like I mentioned he has worse eating habits than I do.  I think he is catching up to my weight too.  During my pregnancy we would both weigh in at my Doctor visits.  He gained right along with me.  He was in the 330-340 range.  After Chloe was born during an after birth Doctor visit he got on the scale and that particular one only went to 350 and I think he was over that.  I always notice everything about his eating habits and that bothers me, the way he eats twice as much and finished first.  I always wonder if he ever tastes his food.  When we are at a party where there is food everywhere I always see him eating something.  Whenever I look for him, there he is picking at this or that.  Like me, always putting something in his mouth if food is around weather he’s hungry or not.  This is a carbon copy of my behavior too.  That’s why I notice it.  I’m exactly the same way.  I suppose the only difference is I realize it and try not to do it.  Because of my mother I am always worried about what other people think of me, and because of her I always imagine them thinking things like, “there’s the fat woman eating again, she would be so pretty if she would just loose weight, or save some for the others, geese!”   My husband and I are both closet eaters.  We both sneak off to eat junk food.  His vice is doughnuts and mine is ice cream.   I wonder how to retrain my brain?  How do I keep negative thoughts out of my head?  How do I not do this to Chloe when I so desperately want her to grow up healthy and happy without the worries of being over weight?  Any suggestions?

      I am 33 years old and I have just given birth to my very first child. Chloe Elizabeth was born on May 28th 2004. My weight when I got pregnant was approximately 380 pounds. Early in the pregnancy I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. I controlled this with diet, I tested my blood 3 times a week and my numbers were fine during the pregnancy. Well, most of the time anyway. I didn’t gain an excessive amount of weight while pregnant, but more than the nutritionist I saw wanted. She wanted me to only gain 15 pounds. On the day I gave birth to Chloe I weighed in at 408 pounds. These numbers seem so enormous when I type them. I don’t feel like the morbidly obese person I am considered. The day after I gave birth to Chloe by C-section I was up and taking short walks. Despite my size and the way I am perceived at first sight I really do have a lot of energy and I like to be up and moving. I will never be a home body by choice. That day I walked down to the other side of the hospital wing and wanted to weigh myself. I had just given birth to a healthy 8 pound baby girl. And, from what the Doctors were telling me I had enough fluid to float a boat. I was hoping for a huge difference on the scale. I stepped on and waited for the digital reading. 401. How can this be? I just extracted an 8 pound human being from my tummy, how could my weight loss only be 7 pounds? I was very discouraged by this. In the days to follow I was being as active as I could. While in the hospital I took as many walks as my pain would let me. When I came home the next day we had Chloe out and about. It was only a couple weeks when I returned to have my staples out and weighed in that the scale read 376. I was so excited by this. But now, 9 weeks later, I’m not feeling as good. I have not weighed myself, because I can only do this at the hospital. I have never found a home scale that will go up to 400 pounds. But tonight I am feeling so fat, so dumpy, so unattractive. I haven’t even left the house today. With a newborn that doesn’t sleep through the night I find myself always tired. But if I don’t stop then I don’t feel it. The minute I stop and sit down, I get sleepy. Tonight I jump started myself. Chloe fell asleep right after Randy, my husband went to bed. I put on my sneakers and my bike shorts and got up on the tread mill for about 20 minutes. I got on the floor and did some leg lifts and stretches. So, here it goes. Here is what I want for myself. This list could be a mile long. Maybe I’ll just keep adding to it. I know I have to do this myself. I have to motivate myself. I can’t rely on anyone. Even though my husband will “diet” with me, I can’t count on him. He has worse eating habits than I do. But I want more for myself and for Chloe. I want more for Randy too, but I have no control over that. He has to want it. I know that if we both were to loose some weight I would start feeling more attractive and sexual. I feel like I’ve lost my sexual feelings. We have both put on a lot of weight since our wedding. All the weight we worked so hard to take off. I’ve been thinking about this a lot. So, here goes; I’ll start my list. My list is; what I want.  #1. I want my lap back. I have no lap. I put my daughter on the tops of my knees, but I want her to be able to sit in my lap, and my lap space is being used by the roll of fat that appears every time I sit down. I want my lap back. #2. I want to be able to sit Indian style on the floor. When did I loose the ability to sit Indian style on the floor? The only way I can sit on the floor is with both my legs strait out and apart. I want to be able to sit Indian style on the floor and put Chloe in the middle like a fun chair. And I want to feel comfortable on the floor. I’m only 33 for crying out loud! #3. The next thing I want goes hand in hand with number 2. I want to be able to spring up from the floor to stand. Why is it such a production for me to get myself up off the floor. Roll over, get on my knees, bring one foot up to the floor, put my hand on that knee, lift myself up, usually with a groan or a sigh. This is ridiculous. My 55 year old mother has an easer time of this! #4. We have a small amusement park here in Portland called Oaks Park. Now, I grew up in California going to all the amusement parks. I loved roller coasters and rides. I want Chloe to love these things too. But who will introduce this too her? Who will take her on the rides and show her what fun it is? There is no way I would ever fit on any of the rides! I have a hard time buckling my seat belt let alone an amusement park ride! Well, I’ll tell you who will take her on her first amusement park ride; I will! That’s right, this is all part of my motivation for wanting to loose weight. I want to take my daughter on a roller coaster ride. I want to yell and scream and laugh with her. #5. I want to run with my child. This really encompasses a lot of things. I want to play with my child. When she wants to play hide and seek I don’t want to tell her I don’t want to play because I don’t have the energy to chase her around. If Chloe wants me to play tag with her damn it we will play. #6. Number six is something that I don’t want. I don’t want to send Chloe on all my errands because I’m too lazy to do it myself. I never want to hear myself say, Chloe will you go get me the…Insert any item here. If I’m on the couch and the phone rings, there will be no thoughts of “I don’t want to get off this couch to answer the phone.” Chloe get momma the remote. Those words will never be spoken by my lips!  I don’t want to watch Chloe grow up. I am really a kid at heart. I love to play games and jump in puddles. I don’t want this body to hinder me from doing what I want to do. And right now it does. I have a good year before Chloe is really ready to want to run and play and notice if I’m not able to do the things she wants me to do with her. A year. This is not unrealistic. And, I’m not wanting to be in a size 5 dress either. I just want to be healthy and happy. Not unlike the things I want for Chloe. I know I am a big girl. But I do not need to be this big. If I could just drop 100 pounds I would be much more happy. But what I really want is to someday dip below the 200 pound mark. I haven't seen that number on the scale since high school, and even then I think I was just over 200 pounds. This is the ultimate long term goal. Not my goal for the next year. By this time next year I want to achieve numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.  I have other fears too. I have a real unhealthy attitude about being fat. Something that I’m afraid I will put on Chloe if I don’t get this straitened out now. Even now my thoughts are not good. When Chloe was born she weighed 8 pounds on the nose. A very healthy weight, although she was born 3 weeks early. She dropped down to 7 pounds because I was not producing enough milk for her so we had to start supplementing her with formula. She has really plumped up now. In the beginning the Doctors were worried about her loosing too much weight after birth, now she is in the 90th percentile for her weight. Am I already raising an overweight child? What can I do to keep this from happening? What is causing her to bloom so fast? Are there too many calories in my breast milk? Lord help her if she is going to be pre disposed to being fat because I am. I don’t ever want to starve her, but I don’t want her topping out the charts for weight in children her age. So, I need to educate myself. I need to learn how to be healthy and raise Chloe to be healthy. I over indulge way too much. My husband does too. I don’t want Chloe to be a slave to food. Food is supposed to be a necessity, fuel for our engine. I hate that one of the first things my husband does when he comes home from work in the early afternoon is ask me what I want to do for dinner. Why does this have to be decided 4 or 5 hours before we are going to eat? Why is this one of the first things on his mind? What’s for dinner? Eat, eat, eat. Stop, stop, stop! Every other thought is about what food is going into our mouth. Food is ruling my life and I want it to stop. Food should be an afterthought. “Oh, my stomach is growling, I should eat something.” I couldn’t even tell you the last time my stomach growled. Except when it growls because I’ve eaten too much crap and it causes me to have gas and I have to spend 5 minutes on the pot because my body has created so much waist from all the crap I have fed it. How do I learn to change my way of thinking? How do I avoid creating a food monster in my daughter? I don’t want her to be everything I wasn’t, I want to be everything I wasn’t. I’m only 33 for Gods sake!
