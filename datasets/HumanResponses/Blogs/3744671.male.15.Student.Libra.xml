      Yay, I just put my $5 down for this game at EB this afternoon to get the free bonus DVD. From what I've seen so far it's well worth it, especially when you're getting the DVD for free in the long run!  The DVD's has 6 or so playable demos for games like RalliSport Challenge 2, Top Spin, Crimson Skies, Project Gotham Racing 2, Amped 2, Sudeki, and some others. It also has a slew of game trailers, not to mention the juicy gameplay footage and interviews, etc. on fable!  If you haven't already pre-ordered this game, go do so, it's money well invested!

      Currently this is hands down the most fun, best game on the Xbox to date, until Halo 2 of course. For me, this was the number one reason for shelling out hundreds of dollars to get my Xbox!  This game has countless hours of gameplay because of it's replayability, sure there's a single player campaign, but once you beat that you have the amazingly fun multiplayer with tons of different modes from deathmatch, to a tag type game, to capture the flag, etc. However, to me, the single best aspect of this entire game is the co-op mode. You and a friend can play the single player campaign together co-operatively via split screen, absolutely brilliant!  The graphics are stunning, the audio is stunning, it's got spot on controls, great mission structure, cool enemies, a memorable main character who's already spawned novels and action figures. Also, this has one of the best stories in a game ever! Obviously seeing as they've already made three novels around this whole story. Also, for once you're A.I controlled teammates are smart! They'll even start shooting you if you kill too many of them! Halo offers a nice array of difficulty settings for beginner players to hardcore gamers. A novice gamer could play the game on Easy or Normal mode and still have fun without being too discouraged, whereas a hardcore gamers can play Heroic or Legendary and still find a challenge worthy of hardcore skills. Also, all these dificulties are available from the get go so no matter how experienced you are at gaming you can have fun without having to worry about breezing through the game in a day, or getting too frusterated to continue.  If you like shooters, you'll love this game, if you'll love multiplayer games to play with a friend, you'll love this game, you want to host a LAN party, you'll love this game. Bascially there's something here for everyone!  I don't think I can find one problem with this game to be honest.    Rating:  10/10      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M

      Besides from the fact this movie had the hottness of Mary-Kate and Ashley and the comedy of Eugene Levee (sp?) in it, there wasn't much else to like about New York Minute. Sure this movie would be entertaining to see...if you are a 12 year old girl, unfortunately I'm not, so I didn't like it too much.  The story was typically dumb like it is in all these types of movies, and the acting wasn't anything special either. That being said, this is a great movie for your little sister or to take younger kids (mainly girls) to, so if that's what you want this is a good flick to go see.  Basically, the story is about twin sisters (guess who plays that role!) with opposite personalities. One is super nerdy the other wants to be a rock star. They both go to New York (hence the title), one to get her band heard at the Simple Plan concert by music scouts, the other to give a speech and try to get a scholarship to Oxford University. It's getting to their destinations that proves difficult (go figure!)  Personally, I wouldn't watch this movie, or recommend it unless you have kids, but still I have to give it points for some funny parts with Eugene Levee, and an appealing film for kids.

      This movie was my favourite super hero movie ever, until, SPider-Man 2 came out, no it's my second, but running the close race between this and X2: X-Men United.   The effects in this movie are great, not near as good as in Spidey 2, but still great. The same goes for the story, acting, writing, directiing, everything is done well. Spider-Man is obviously a character who took much better to the big screen than some big green dude I know (ahem, Hulk).   I thought they did a great job keepthing this film close in line with the comic book, which I really admire and give them credit for.   Now I may be a little biased because I love Spidey, but not too much, it's still a great film whether you love him or hate him.     Rating:  4.5/5       ------------------  Thanks,  ~Brian M

      I'm frickin' tired tonight! Last night we went to the dusk till dawn show at the drive in to see four movies, then we had to go to my grandpa's to take my grandma and get a gift fro my grandpa (it's his birthday soon) and make dinner reservations for his b-day, etc. etc. so I didn't get any sleep! Also, only one movie was good. Since I had to go with my mom and sister, the movie weren't all that interesting, but I'll do some reviews when I feel like it anyhow.  The movies were New York Minute (the new Olsen twins flick), Cinderella Story (with Hillary Duff, so you know it sucked!), Catwoman (not much good to see there besides Halle Berry in leather), andTroy (the good film)      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M

      First DVD Box Set review, but it will be scored with the same guide lines as a film.   This show is truly hilarious. It was created by Matt Groening who created the Simpsons, but I will go on record and say I like Futurama better than The Simpsons (I love the Simpsons too though). The reason why I like it better is mainly because I am a huge Sci-Fi geek so to speak so I love the little references to Star Trek and other Science-Fiction stuff in here.   This beauty has 13 episodes, all of which also have directors commentary, which is (from what DVD sets I've bought so far) the BEST commentary, and most funny I've ever heard. I haven't got the Volume Two of Futurama yet though, so this is just going by the few DVD sets I've bought thus far. While we're talking about extras, it also has a few scripts, amonst other stuff you can find on here.   All the episodes look beautiful. The show actually uses a combination of 2D and 3D animation, so it looks really cool. All the voice acting is fabulous, I think I enjoy listening to these actors better than the ones who do the Simpsons even. All the writing is great too. I love it!   Overall, if you at all like the Simpsons and/or Sci-Fi like me, you will FLIP out over this, it's incredible! A must have DVD!!     Rating:  5/5       ------------------  Thanks,  ~Brian M

             Here is another great Quentin Tarantino film in my opinion.   Pulp Fiction has great acting, great story telling, great writing, everything like that. I really like the fact that this story is told from a bunch of different perspectives and all interconnects.   Basically, the story is about a boxer who doesn't take a dive when he's supposed to so contract killers are sent after him, along with other numurous events I don't feel like mentioning. They're all good though, so go check this one out for sure.     Rating:  4/5       ------------------  Thanks,  ~Brian M

      Quentin Tarantino is one of my favourite writers/directors right now. I loved Pulp Fiction, I loved Resevoir Dogs, and I love Kill Bill!   It's got the typical Tarantino violence that I've come to expect and love from his films, plus comedy, cool stunts, good acting, great writing, everything about this film is good.   The basic story of Kill Bill is about the lead character (called "The Bride") trying to retire from the assassination business, but her boss Bill won't let her, and ends up hiring assassins to kill her and her family at her wedding. However, they don't kill her, only hospitalize her, then Bill shoots her in the head when she's in the hospital which sends her into a coma. When she wakes up, she sets out to Kill Bill like the movie title says.   This movie is the first part in the series, and the second part is coming out soon. There have also been rumours of a third Kill Bill film coming out in a while, but nothing has been confirmed to my knowledge.   If you like action movies, comedys, or Kung-Fu this film will appeal to you, hell even if you don't you'll still apreciate this film. Go check it out.     Rating:  4/5

      Here's an older film, made in 1959 give or take a year actually. At first, I was skeptical about watching this, because it was before my time and moybe the humour in it wouldn't appeal to me, in which case I would've wasted two hours of my precious life. Turns out I was wrong, and I'm glad I watched it. I thought it was really funny.   The whole plot of the movie is that this lowly country invades America, but all along have the intention of surrendering so that other countries would give them money and such to help "rebuild" there country after the war in which they "lost." When they get to America, they land in New York and everyone is underground so they kidnap a scientist and his assistant who are working on a bomb capable of blowing up...a lot! Anyhow then the story evolves and they have to disarm the bomb because it's unstable, etc.   Just an all in all good comedy.     Rating:  3/5       ------------------  Thanks,  ~Brian M

      I know this film has been getting mixed reviews, but personally, begin the big sci-fi geek that I am, I really enjoyed this film. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately I haven't read the stories which this film is based off of, so I can't really compare it to anything, and don't know what I'm missing in the stories.   I thought the actors did a great job in this, I thought the effects were great, the robots looked pretty darn cool. I also thought they did a pretty decent job with the music and sound effects in this film.   So far, this is my second favourite film of the summer, and also the year, behind Spider-Man 2! You will proably appreciate this film and enjoy it more if you're a science-fiction fan like myself, or you might not if you've grown up reading the short stories and are attached to them, but never the less I still love it. I might be scoring this a little generous because I do like science-fiction stuff more than any other genre of films, but it is deserving in my mind.

      Here is a typical disaster movie, a familiar feel to other movies of it's kind, but the only difference is this one's done pretty damn well! There's no doubt that if you're into this genre, you will love this movie, and appreciate it more than someone who isn't. For me, I am borderline on these films, I like them, but they certainly aren't my favourite type of movie.   I still enjoyed it though, good acting, nice special effects. Overall, nothing that will revolutionize or define the genre, but it's one of the best disaster films I've seen in a long time.   It's more of a great way to spend an evening, so unless you dig this type of film, I would say give it a rental when it comes out and that should satisfy viewers like me.

             Here are my picks for the best gaems coming out in July (well, should be coming out in July)!!   1. Sudeki (Xbox)  2. Tales of Symphonia (GameCube)  3. NCAA Football 2005 (Xbox, PS2, GameCube)   I know there aren't too many this month, but I'm more than confident that there will be a longer list for August, so that'll give you guys some extra cash to put towards the great games in August, like say, Doom 3!!       ------------------  Thanks,  ~Brian M

      I went to see this fantastic movie last Tuesday, and am definitely glad I did! It is definitely my favourite movie of the summer thus far, and my favourite movie based on a comic book character/superhero yet!   From the opening scene to the end credits, Spider-Man 2 is full of non-stop action and suspense!  Now, if you're a big Spidey fan like me and read the comic books, then you'll notice a few things in this film that seem a little off, but those minor details can easily be overlooked when you're lost in the thrills of this movie.   If you only go to see one movie this summer, hell  so far  this year, make sure it's Spider-Man 2!     Rating:  5/5       ------------------  Thanks,  ~Brian M

      I went and saw this one last Wednesday, but haven't been home until late last Friday night, then was busy basically all of Saturday so I'm just getting caught up now :p   I recommend everyone to go check out this movie. I had no idea until I saw this film (by Michael Moore, same guy who made Bowling For Columbine) some of the stuff that went on in the eletion, and during 9/11 until now. It also gives the viewer a very interesting perspective of the war in Iraq. Most documentaries are boring to me, unless I really like the subject, but this film found a way around that and kept my attention for the whole ride.   Even though I'm Canadian, I still found this movie fascinating, one of my favourite documentaries to date.     Rating:  4/5       ------------------  Thanks,  ~Brian M

      Just incase anyone is reading this, I'll tell you how I score games and movies. Also, I might occasionally review a DVD Box Set too, which will follow the same format as movies, which I will explain below! I won't review audio CD's because obviously everyone's taste in music is different, but I may review a book, occasionally which will follow the movie ratings guide!    Movies:      I score movies on a scale of 1 to 5.   Here's the breakdown of those rankings...  1 = crap, avoid this film at all costs  2 = below average, possibly worth a rental  3 = average, no rush to see this film  4 = good, you won't go wrong with buying this one (if you have the same tastes as me LOL)  5 = awesome! A must see, must buy film!     Games:  I score games on a scale of 1 to 10.   Here's the breakdown... 0-4.5 = bad, possibly a rental at best! 5.0-6.5 = mediocre, usually a rental, occasionally a purchase if in bargain bin! 7.0-8.5 = good, a solid purchase or rental 9-10 = Great! A must have game!       ------------------  Thanks,  ~Brian M

      I was in Wal-Mart a while ago (not my last bargain bin spree that occurred yesterday, see post below somewhere, but a while ago) and while browsing through the PC games they had, I got a bunch for cheap!  Here's what I found in the PC department:  Freedom Force James Bond 007: Nightfire Indiana Jones and The Emperor's Tomb Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds Command & Conquer: Renegade Need For Speed III: Hot Pursuit Earth &amp; Beyond Sim City 3000 Unlimited Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun Tiger Woods PGA Tour Collection SIM Theme Park Lego: Island Extreme Stunts Lego: Soccer Mania SIM Safari SIM Town SIM Coaster   And ALL those games were a little less than $35 Canadian!      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M

      Okay, so these rumours have been floating around in cyber space for quite some time now, but anyhow I thought I'd address them here and express my opinions :)  First off, Microsoft is considering taking out the hard drive!!! What the fuck? For me, that was the BIGGEST SELLING POINT of the first Xbox (besides Halo and Dead or Alive 3). I like my Xbox's hard drive better than those lame, piece of shit memory cards for PS2 and GameCube. However, you can get a hard drive for PS2, but the crooks make you shell out more cash for it! I know Microsoft if talking about an add on hard drive like Sony did (that would piss me off!!!!) or having Flash Memory, but I still just want my fucking hard drive! I mean, if I need to move files, then I'll buy a flash memory stick or a memory card but if I'm playing at home where I don't need to transfer, give me a damn hard drive, don't make me pay an additional sum just to get the "privellage" to save my game!  Second, Microsoft is probably ruled out backwards compatibility. Now, I know they will probably have some issues because ATI is doing the chips for Xbox 2, and nVidia did Xbox, but still something I wish they could try and work around. I would be glad to wait an extra month or so for them to do this so I don't have to keep my Xbox hooked up, which would take up too much space. It's getting cluttered by my TV already with my Xbox, TV, VCR, games, DVDs, and soon to be GameCube.      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M

      If your computer has been getting slow lately, or you've been putting alot of shit onto it during use, you should really defrag it frequently! I try to defragment my computer every couple weeks or so to keep it as neat and organized as possible. For as long as I can remember whenever I want to defrag my computer, I've always used the defragment tool built into Windows XP, but recently I heard about Disk Keeper on  The Screen Savers  and decided to check it out.  You can either download a trial to see if you like it like I have done (just Google it and you'll find a place to d/l it I'm sure), or of course, get it from Kazaa so you don't have to pay for the full version - however, that is not recommended! ;) I like it, and find it works alot better than the sub-par defrag tool Windows has, go check it out.      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M

      I just made a trip to Wal-Mart yesterday to buy a birthday gift for my grandpa, and while in the electronics department, I decide to go check out the bargain bin, but I didn't expect to find anyting.  Boy, I was dead wrong! I found Special Edition Titan A.E. on DVD in widescreen format for only $6.88 (Canadian funds). Daredevil Special Edition DVD in widescreen format for only $9.96 (Canadian funds). Spawn 2 Collector's Edition DVD, which turned out to be an animated type film, or series that I thought was awesome, for only $6.88 Canadian.  Then I scooped up Metal Arms: Glitch in The System, a pretty damn good game, for Xbox which only ran me $18 Canadian. Also, I contemplated buying Whiplash for Xbox which was only $17! But I decided I had already put a dent in my GameCube savings fund by about $50 so I'd stop there :p  Besides electronics I also picked up an awesome Spider-Man 2 poster for $5.77, which filled in a big gap on my wall, just waiting for a good poster.  Next I moved on to the toys section, and found two packs of Marvel MiniMates I still needed for my collection, bought both of them at $8.92 each.  All in all, a good shopping day :)      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M

      This is a fairly new application that will tell you what games your friends are currently playing online. Obviously, this one is only for PC games so it won't tell you about Xbox Live or PS2 online, etc.  Anyhow, why it's cool is that it's an instant messenger that you can quickly download for free at  urlLink xfire.com   It will show you what your friend is playing online, and allow you to join, chat, etc. Pretty cool for those who play alot online. Obviously, you only see gamers who you've added like you would via MSN or ICQ, etc.  If I ever get high speed (very unlikely, very, very unlikely) expect to see this gamer online with all the cool ones from Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, etc! Until then, I don't find much use for this when I can only play StarCraft, Age of Empires, and other RTS games online.      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M

I was running my Spybot 1.2 and finding very little is any spyware, so I thought I was okay, but then I decided "What the hell, I'll download Spybot 1.3 and see if it helps alot more" and it did! Definitely! I found 52 entries of Spyware on my PC when I ran 1.3! that's 52 problems Spybot 1.2 couldn't find, even though I updated it frequently.      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M

      If you listen to punk rock, or any type of new rock radio station you've probably heard some Blink 182 before. Personally, they're my fav punk band, and one of my fav bands of all time!  There's latest CD is self-titled, Blink 182, and I think it's their best album yet! Even though it has a different sound to it from any of their other songs.

Amazing book!   You can buy it urlLink  here for US  and  urlLink here for Canada   The only bad thing about this book, especialyl the one on Amazon's Canadian web site is the steep price point, but still a worthwhile investment!      ------------------ ~Thanks, Brian M

      Here's a book to help you cope with all those little problems or annoyances caused by Windows. This book is packed with a bunch of tips and tricks to make your PC, well, less annoying and more efficient if you will.  It's written by Steve Bass, by the way.  My favourite thing about this book besides how helpful it is, is actually the price point, pretty cheap for a book like this.  I haven't recieved it yet, but I ordered it from Amazon, and should be arriving soon hopefully! Highly recommend you check it out.  You can buy it at either  urlLink amazon.com (American)  or  urlLink amazon.ca (Canadian)  :)      ----------------- Thanks, ~Brian M

             I've been hearing alot of people having problems finding the Scandisk in Windows XP. Well, in case you're one of the poeple searching for it, keep reading, I've got answers.  First off, they do things a littel different in XP, but it can still be done. The best way I find, is going into   My Computer   then   Right-Click   on the drive you want to perform scandisk, and click on   Properties  . Next, click on the tab at the top that says   Tools   then under   Error-checking   select   Check Now  .  Not too hard after all, eh? :)      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M

       	Like to play video games but have a low budget? Well, I have a couple of titles you'll want to check out, because unlike most games that hit the bargain bin, these ones are actually good!    I'm not only posting this to give you guys great deals on cool games, but if we don't support this type of innovation and only go for the advertised, popular games such as the Madden Footballs, then developers will just make variations of current successful games rather than creating innovative, creative titles...and we don't want that! So go ahead, check out these title, you'll be pleasantly surprised what a game that costs under $20 can do!  So you're now saying "Well, if they're good, then why the hell are they in the bargain bin?" and I say to that "Because, they have very low sales records, which is unfortunate, but with all the big name companies and titles out there, sometimes these little innovations get left behind!"  Anyhow, without further delay, here's a list of good games you can get for cheap!  1.  Beyond Good & Evil (Xbox, PSC, GCN, PC)  - Crappy sales have forced this title to the bargain bin at rock bottom prices! And it's an amazing game! Top notch scores from Official Xbox Magazine, XGP Gaming, etc. - Definitely a good buy, fantastic experience in the action/adventure/platforming genres.  2.  I-Ninja (Xbox, PSC, GCN)  - This cartoony looking character can do tons of cool moves like run on walls, and all the cool stuff you would expect from a top notch well motion-captured game such as Prince of Persia, only this game can be found for half the cost! Give this one a chance, and you'll be pleasantly surprised.  3.  Metal Arms: A Glitch In The System (Xbox, PS2)  - This game has flavours of popular games like Metroid Prime, etc. This game is probably one of the biggest "sleeper hits" of 2003. No one saw it coming, but this game delivers a great experience for a cheap price. - Another title that won't disappoint when given a chance.  4.  ICO (PS2)  - Here is a game that screams innovation and creativity! This is a fantastic game, but no one bought it! Now you can buy it for extremely cheap! So why not? - This game also has a very unique art style that looks fantastic!  5.  Armed &amp; Dangerous (Xbox, PC)  - This game is another example of a funny, fast paced action game that is more fun thatn it is innovative, but still it's more important you have fun while playing a game, and you will when you play Armed &amp; Dangerous.  5.  Breakdown (Xbox)  - here's a game that leaves you in a first person perspective for the ENTIRE time you play the game whether it be fighting, exploring or even vomiting! Yes, vomiting! - This is a pretty innovative title from Namco, that has a compeling story along with it. - It's pretty new, but already has been pushed to the bargain bin!  As well as the titles I've listed if you browse around online stores like  urlLink EBGames  you'll be able to buy the titles I listed, plus search for others you can get for a good price.  There's also plenty of titles for the Xbox which can be bought for $19.99 American, or $29.99 Canadian that are called "Platinum hits" meaning they have sold well, and are now being sold for cheap. Sony does the same thing, only they're PS2 games are called "Greatest Hits" when they are sold for the same price as Platinum Hits. Nintendo calls their cheap games that've sold well "Player's Choice".   Want to find out more about the above games or any other games for that matter? Simply go to  urlLink IGN ,  urlLink GameSpot ,  urlLink GameSpy , and others you'll find out there!      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M

             We've probably all heard of Apple's iPod. If not, you can check it out at  urlLink apple.com .  I've wanted one of these beautiful devices for quite some time now, but the price point is very steep!  Unfortunately I still don't have one yet, but my friend just bought one and I was looking at it, and got my first chance to try it out and put music on it. I must say, this is amazing! He has the 30 GB version, which is enourmous, you can cram tons and tons of tunes on there! If you're in the market for a new MP3 player, and can afford one of these dandies, buy it! I hope to get one soon enough. They're so handy too, you'll have all your music on this little device, no more lugging around your CD collection! And I have a HUGE CD collection, so when I'm traveling I can never bring it all, only a small portion of it. This way, you can put it all on your iPod. It's also big enough to pack around other types of files besides audio tracks.      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M

      Here's a book I highly recommend checking out if you're at all interested in the video game industry. It's a book about two guys (who's names escape me for the moment) made Doom, which turned out to be a mega success for them. It's a great book with lots of backstory and everything. Definitely an interesting book! Highly recommended! The only problem is I've went to book stores like Chapters and Coles to look for Masters of Doom and had no luck, but I was able to buy it online from Amazon luckily.  If you're interested you can buy the book  urlLink here if you're American   or   urlLink here if you're Canadian   Not a bad price either considering it's a hard cover book, plus books in general like this are usually more elsewhere.      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M

             Don't you hate it when you're trying to surf the net, only to be bombarded by popups! Well, never fear, I've got an awesome popup blocker for you!  Let me introduce, My Popup Killer (MPK), it has an automatic mode that will close popup windows automatically, or a manual mode where you pick what windows to block. Plus other stuff. It's definitely my favourite popup blocker so far because of it's simplicity and efficiency! I know there's alot of pop-up blockers out there, but I recommend this one.   urlLink Here is the site it tells me to go to  hope you can find it, seems to have slipped away for now, but ifnot, just Google it or whatever I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.      ----------------- Thanks, ~Brian M

             Just downloaded this program. It's pretty darn cool. It allows you to download things faster than normally, which is always good! I have dial-up (unfortunately) so this was especially eye catching to me, but even those of you luck enough to have DSL or Cable, or what have you this is still cool, because hey, we always want things downloaded faster despite the speed of our internet connection!  You can download this for free  urlLink here       ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M

             Here's a tool you can download for free  urlLink here  that allows you to crop out time from a song. This is a very handy program, I know I've downloaded songs, the legal way of course ;) where it had a long pause at the beginning and/or end of teh song. I never want to wait that long to here my song, plus time on space CD or MP3 player is priceless! Now I can just trim it down nice and snug and now waste any time on my MP3 player! It can also adjust the volume of your tracks, or cause them to fade in or out accordingly. Pretty neat for a small download.      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M

      Ever recieved one of those annoying emails that supossidly from PayPal, or American Express, or someplace where you have personal info like a credit card stored and tell you it's expiring, or something to make you type the info in? Well, if you have, be careful there's lots of scammers who do just this! They send you an email that will say to click on a link to eBay, or American Express or where ever and ask you to type in your credit card number because it's expiring, but really, the URL could take you to a completely different, unsecure webiste just so they can get your credit card number!  Well, there's a very helpfull tool to help you prevent getting majorly scammed like this!  I heard of this little tip while watching an episode of  urlLink The Screen Savers  which is a very informative, neat tech related TV show on the best channel on the planet,  urlLink G4TechTV   Anyhow, back to SpoofStick, it's a little toolbar type thing that is added to your broswer that tells you what site you're REALLY on so if these scammers try to take you to a link that isn't what they say, you can get the hell out of there!  It's a free download, doesn't take too long by the way. You can download it  urlLink here   Another freebie too :)  Oh, and it only is available to download for Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox browsers.      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M

             Is your cmputer full of pesky Spyware, creating it to run excruciatingly slow? Want to check and see if your computer is being plagued by Spyware? Want to know what the hell Spyware is and why you don't want it on your machine?  Well, then I've got some answers for you!  First off, Spyware is very annoying! How do you get it? You get it all the time from surfing the net! Some web pages you go to install spyware on your computer without you even knowing. So why is this so bad? Well, it tracks what you're doing and sends it back to whoever is tracking you, but the main problem with Spyware is that it really slows down your computer! Luckily, I have a tool that will allow you to scan your omputer for Spyware, then remove it! Hopefully speeding up your system or just relieving you that it's no longer there. This tool is important, even if you have an Anti-Virus program such as Norton, AVG, or McAfee installed on your system because Spyware is not a virus and will most likely not be picked up by your Anti-Virus software.  The program I use and recommend for this is called Spybot Search & Destroy!  Anyhow, download  Spybot   urlLink here   I also use Ad-Aware, which is similar to Spybot and I recommend having both these programs on your machine. It's always good to have extra protection after all, and when both programs are free, why not!  Download  Ad-Aware   urlLink here   Totally free downloads by the way :D      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M

             Here's a URL where you can get a free one year subscription to PC Magainze! There are no print copies left, but you can still get digital copies (what I'm doing) where you get an email telling you to download a program that will display your magazines. Then you download the magazine and it will be stored on your hard drive where you can view it whenever you want! They give you every single page too, including advertisements so you're not missing anything by going digital. Pretty simple, plus it's free so why not!   urlLink Subscribe Here!       ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M

       	If you're a hardcore PC gamer, then you'll probably want to check out  urlLink Alienware .   They have some of the best machine for gaming I've seen! And you can fully customize any model on their website (which can be reached via the link provided).  The only bad part about these machine is the price point, especially when you get into customized machines, the price point can get very steep! However, these are definitely the coolest looking PC's on Earth!  I was messing around and customizing an Aurora Desktop PC (which is Alienware's AMD computer, BTW) and here are some pretty crazy specs I got, with an even crazier price!   Warranty:  3-Year AlienCare Toll-Free 24/7 Phone Support with Onsite Service   AlienRespawn  (which is a tool to return your computer to it's factory settings if something goes wrong) Alienware® Respawn Recovery Kit   Chassis:  Alienware® Full-Tower Chassis with 480 Watt Power Supply with Cyborg Blue casing colour!

             Ok, so if you've read my profile you know the two things I love most in life are video games and tech related stuff! Well, there is a TV channel that can be ordered from most satelite or cable providers called G4TechTV. This is my most favourite TV station ever! I watch it more than anything else on my dish!  I love it so much because it's a TV channel dedicated to video games and tech related stuff! Every single show is about video games, or tech realted stuff! I't absolutely phonomenal! If you like these things too, I definitely recommend you get it, if you can! You shouldn't have any problems if you have a decent satelite or cable provider. The greatest thing for me is the price point! I have a fairly limited budget and can still easily afford this channel. It's only $1.99 plus tax per month from bell ExpressVU. However, I've unfortunately heard that some providers can charge more for it, still well worth the price of admission!  For more information, go to  urlLink G4TechTV       The website will give you all kinds of info on the channel itself, plus the different porgrams it has on!      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
