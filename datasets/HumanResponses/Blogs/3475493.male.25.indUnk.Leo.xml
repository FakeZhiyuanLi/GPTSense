						   The Cheers is having some problems again, don't ask me when it will be up again, but when it is, be sure to check out my cover article.  I'm writing a screen play, yes I bit the proverbial bullet and decided to throw my hat into that arena. I won't elaborate too much, but it's based in Australia and is both romantic and violent. As a result of this commitment, I may change the frequency of my Cheers articles, this I have not yet decided on completely yet.

						   I only know one other person that thought Lord Of The Rings: Return Of The King had a shitty ending. I make the point that I haven't read the books, but I think the ending was such a boring and wimpy ending that I almost needed a sick bag. It dragged on for so long that it felt like half the movie, although it was only about half an hour. I disliked it so much that it has put me off buying any of the parts of the movie, despite how much I like everything else. This is really bad as I want to get it all on DVD, but that ending still makes me want to gag to this day. Does anyone else feel like this? I almost feel guilty. Almost.

						   Disc media is great, but where are we going to put it all when we have one thousand CD's and five-hundred DVD's sitting in our rooms? This is a question I have asked myself quite a few times over the last decade or more.  The space an average person has seems to be getting smaller, particularly in the cities. New buildings are being broken into smaller apartments, those who do have bigger abodes are faced with squeezing in their parents as many governments neglect to support nursing homes or retirement flats, their children stay at home longer as housing/rental prices go up and the support decreases for new home buyers or renters, computers are taking up space as are the workstations that house them.  So I ask you, where the hell is all the collected material going to fit in this already overloaded house? Well it just isn't going to fit in grandma's bathroom and that isn't a very attractive solution. We need to encourage a change in how we store and catalogue our entertainment needs, especially when the entertainment industry does not support us by placing copy protection on items that we need to put on more compact media eg. hard disk etc. Let them know how you feel, because I for one, am feeling claustrophobic.

						   Dawn of the Dead is the bomb, it wasn't stupid, it was gory, it wasn't overlong, it was funny, it wasn't a bad remake, it was fairly original in most respects, it was also one of the better horror movies I've seen this year, which isn't difficult, but still an achievement none the less. An all round worthy flick, go see it...now!  Spider-Man 2 is out soon too, probably the next movie to see. Just hope it doesn't miss out on all the potential plot ideas that come with Doc Ock trying to screw up Pete's life.

						   Going to see Dawn of the Dead tonight, always look forward to a new horror movie, especially with plenty of death, gore and subliminal messaging. I'll let you know what it was like, if anyone wants to share their thoughts drop me a line and I'll post it on here.

						   Just what is going down in Tajikistan and Afghanistan, when the Russian military has to sit on the border a blow the crap out of those who cross? The simple answer is this: Drugs. Smugglers who want to get the product to Europe, Russia and possibly the rest of the world need to make it across this border and then are free to pull in the big dollars. The Russian forces do not fuck around, they have tanks and other military goodies to fight this drug war, a war the Western powers could care less about. I've been reading about this in an Australian military magazine called Contact, it's brilliant. I'm not usually one to read this kind of mag, but it's very well put together and an achievement for Australian publishing.  Back to the drugs though, these bad-arse Russian guys are usually killing the smugglers they come across. Don't feel completely bad for the drug guys, many come armed to the teeth themselves as any weapon of choice is available in Afghanistan (much of it probably ex-Russian hardware or captured American stuff). How is all of this happening? How are the drugs being grown in the first place? What is the United States Military doing to stop this at the source? Well no one is stopping it, pure and simple, the poppy fields continue to grow and the US simply has no policies to stop what is an important money maker for terrorists. Isn't great to see the progress that is being made in Afghanistan? Maybe the Russians need to go back in there...no forget I said that. They should at the very least be commended in their efforts to stop trafficking, where no one else seems interested.  The thing that this all boils down to though is this, if the Tajiks and Afghans weren't so dirt poor and desperate for cash, there wouldn't be so many smugglers or growers in the first place. This is an example of why social and economic solutions are often more important than political or military ones.

						   Kick back, relax, have a kit kat, that's what I'm doing at the moment, trying to remember how to rest for a bit before I go back to the world of learning that is Uni. My study holidays are going to be just that - study, I've got to get and start producing some real work for my Professional Editing course, before Accounting/Management starts eating up my life again.  My next article that I will be writing needs to be on the smutty side, I've been a bit self-help and save the worldish in my last two, so I need to make up for it and write something that is a bit naughty. Who knows, maybe it will get some more readers and comments? Though it really isn't going to be the intention, I've always been a bit on the sexual side with my writing, especially since writing porn reviews. You'll have to wait and see what I come up with.

						   I will be putting up the full text of all my Cheers articles on the blog after the next issue is released, this is the first one here:  Loneliness  by Matt Holt   G’day mate! Uh…bloody hell…sorry I’ve always been uncomfortable with those words as a representation of my country. Sure I use them, but many Australians will react in one of two ways if that is said to them. They may laugh it off or  go quiet and think you’re an idiot. I’d probably react with the former rather than the latter. This column is basically going to be about anything and everything that may be of interest. Anything goes.     That said, I’m from a small town in Victoria. That’s the state Melbourne belongs to, for those who aren’t sure. I want to discuss my first topic -- something that I am pretty familiar with- loneliness. We all suffer from it sometime in our lives, but I want to talk about some of the situations where it occurs. Why am I familiar with this you ask?      Well I’ll tell you even if you didn’t ask, I’m an only child. Now I’m sure some people out there are thinking, ‘Who cares. I’m one too!’ but have they been left in a car for hours with nothing to do but imagine the world outside and talk to themselves? Have they spent hours with plastic toys creating worlds of their own? Or have they had their two best friends in the world leave their high school within months of each other? If they have or dealt with worse, then I thank them for I really don’t know that many people who have experienced the same situations.     Loneliness, as an only child or anyone on their own, can sometimes make you feel as if you’re the only person in the world. At times, having that world interrupted by outsiders can be frustrating. It’s a funny situation because, on the one hand, it’s great that they are around to keep you company, but, on the other hand, they are stopping you from connecting with your own adventures. I’ll give you an example. As a kid, my two cousins visited, something they very rarely did. I had all the toys lying around in the room and of course they came in and upset the strange ‘harmony’ or ‘strategic positioning’ of the various figures. Did I just let them have their fun, while I was planning World War 3? No way! A fight broke out. Needless to say, I won. Probably because I was the most angry and obsessed. Now imagine if we were three different countries…I’d probably be North Korea.     I think education can have a lot to do with loneliness, I’ve seen many people in this world not talk to one another simply because they believe are not on each other’s level. ‘He’s/She’s so smart, I won’t understand what’s going on’, or, ‘This guy/girl doesn’t even know where Melbourne is’. I don’t really think that it is such an impossible task for this kind of communication to be achieved; we just need to reach out.      For example the baker can tell the lawyer about how the cake mixture was not right: there’s a conversation just by discussing work. Since we’re talking about education, let’s look at a high school scenario. You’re the wonder brain of your class. You can’t seem to talk to anyone else about the work because they either don’t care or aren’t at the same level. The solution to this is not to stop talking and sit in the corner. It’s to find that common ground. There is sure to be another person in that room who hates to eat their vegetables or likes to watch The Simpsons. The opening up to each other seems to be the hard part instead of name calling first and becoming friendly later.     I’m going to come a little full circle here, by mentioning writer’s loneliness. It’s kind of similar to the only child scenario, not in the way that the only people you tend to argue with is your parents (story of my life), but that writers have their voice/imagination which is the equivalent of the child’s made-up-world. You are in that world when writing is great; you love that no one is interfering with what you are writing... but what if someone wants to help out? That could be great too. This is where it’s tricky, should we share our little worlds or get lost in them by ourselves? In this case I’d prefer the latter. Guess I’m still a bit of an only child.    For any of the comments that are made on the articles (I had two comments for my first article, not bad!) make sure you go to The Cheers to check them out. I have finished my exams today and will resume blog posting from Monday, also got my next Cheers column done, so you will hopefully see that soon too. I'm back baby, have a good weekend everyone.

						   Inspiration is never difficult for me, especially when I listen to music like Something For Kate. What can I say about a band that I've followed since the beginning? I have every track they've put out, that I know of, and even some of the other projects they have been involved with like Sandpit etc. I've seen them in concert a number of times, even at an underage venue (I was either 17 or 18, not sure which). The band was formed in 1994, I was 14/15 then (I thought I was older than that, maybe just in my mind) and the line-up has changed slightly since then. See their site from more info at  urlLink www.somethingforkate.com  . I just took a look at it, haven't been there for years, most of the movies they are into are the same as I'm into. Funny that I should figure that out now. The books also look like what I'm into, but I never find the time to read enough these days, pity.  The music talks about everything; maybe that's why I write about everything. It covers thoughts from the mundane to the cosmic, exploring all these different ideas which you really get to appreciate over time. It's not just the music that you learn to appreciate, the photography for album covers, the music clips, all seem to be a great extention of the music itself giving you more opportunity to think and to imagine what the lyrics discuss.  The music will forever be a favourite of mine, a big reason for this is because it has made me question my own direction in life. Something For Kate has also brought me much listening joy, just to listen to the music itself, being a guitar player myself (albeit a very bad one). If they are ever in your town, check them out.

						   I thought I had some good news, but we all know what life is like by now and I'm not talking about a box of chocolates either, sorry Forrest. My article for The Cheers was supposed to be in the current issue, number 16, but was not edited in time. That was going to be the good news. I guess the real good news though, is that I picked up the game I.G.I-2 (I'm Going In 2) for half price, some good cheap DVD's (Civic Video's sale started on Saturday) and a place for 120 DVD's to call home (new DVD storage rack). So there is some good to have come about lately, so stuff to keep out of mischief.  Every Easter, my town has some sort of Christian religious symbolism placed not too far from my house. They had the nativity scene and a wooden cross placed not to far away. Some time has now passed and the scene is gone, but the cross remains. This has led to confusion. You know how some people place wreaths and crosses and other markings if someone has died on the side of the road? This stupid cross that is still sitting there, is attracting a placement of flowers from well-meaning passers by. Here you have people who are making the assumption that they are paying their respects to the dead, but there is no dead to give a shout out to. This cross needs to be moved before the place becomes a flower shop...shit I hope no one has actually grieved over it, that would be really strange.

						   I went for a position, it was as an Office Administrator, the rejection letter was sent as something completely different, a position of Concreter/General Hand. Get the connection? Neither did I. Today the Employment service sent another one clarifying which job I had actually lost, does that mean I get to be a mixer of cement now? No offence, but they can have it. Then I get another letter from the actual employer saying that I didn't get the Office Administrator position either. That is actually really good, because I was going to have to break it to them that I didn't want the damn thing in the first place. Too many hours, sounds like a bit of a slave environment and the place was hazardous too (got some chewing gum stuck to the arse of my good pants, what happened to safe working environments?).  In better news, I checked out the blog of this cool chick it's called 'Honey Texture', check it out here:  urlLink http://honeytexture.blogspot.com/  she is in fact dyslexic and not joking around. Why do they make dyslexic hard to spell when the people who have it are having enough troubles reading and writing? I think they should just call it 'jib' or something simpler. Bloody English language, that's why I only speak Australian (heh).  I'll be gone over the weekend, hope to have some good news for you all early next week, if not it will be as depressing as usual.

						   It seems that The Cheers(.org) online magazine has been having issues, the server died after an influx of traffic from fark.com. However pretty much all seems to be okay now, I wouldn't mind that kind of traffic, but you never know, maybe one day. I won't go out of my way to get visitors, but I have nothing against a bit of promotion.  I saw a film last night about the abduction of Kim Dae-Jung, the first democratically elected leader of South Korea. The film was called KT (see  urlLink http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309751/ ), which is the nickname the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) gave him, they were the ones responsible for taking him from the relative safety of Japan. The Self Defence Forces (SDF) of Japan also played a role in this act, which is bizarre, considering the general animosity that each side would have had for the other, considering the history of the occupation of Korea by Japan. I think they were afraid of the possible regime that may take over from South Korea's dictatorship, that it may cause a power shift or become a new threat to Japan. It is a pretty good flick, it starts out slow, but if you hang around for the second half, it pays dividends, particularly if you realise that this pretty much a true story. It's nice to see a relatively modern (1970's) story with political intrigue come from Asia rather than the usual countries, it's even nicer to see Japanese and South Korean film makers work together. If anyone can suggest any other films from Asia that might be similar in tone, I'd love to know.  I just installed Norton's Internet Security 2004 today and there seems to be no issues with it, it even kept my old settings from the 2002 version. It has some extra stuff that makes it worthwhile like spam killing and its supposed be take on spyware and adware that jumps onto your computer at will. I'd recommend it especially if you don't want situations like being on the computer at three o'clock in the morning and have some punk from South Korea then another one from Egypt in the space of 10 minutes try to hack into your shit. I understand the mentality, I just don't appreciate some one else going through my underwear draws, particularly if I'm not waking up next to them in the morning.  I think I've figured out the first topic I want to discuss for my column at The Cheers, it's going to be about loneliness, provided they accept that idea. I'm going to talk about the loneliness of being an only child, of being an intelligent person at a school full of sporty dipshits (yeah, I know it sounds like Revenge of The Nerds, what can I say?) and the loneliness of writing (now that's sort of ironic right?). I think I'll call the article 'Lonely', took allot of thought that.

						   I really need to start studying for exams, I just haven't progressed very far lately, it might have something to do with the fact that I'm sick of studying. It has been too many years and too many institutions that I've been studying with, I think I really just need a break...too bad I recently enrolled in something though.  I'm also really torn between different vocations, but that is enough complaining from me...for now. I just read somewhere that Australian wine and kangaroo meat is in demand from Central and Eastern Europe, while wine shipments to Russia have grown nearly 600 per cent in the last year. Hmmm, maybe I should get in on that action too? Must resist temptation...It is common knowledge in this country that there are already way too many wine produces here, despite their reputation and quality produce.  It's funny though, I don't think the average Australian was ever into wine, until the growth in production occured triggering a wine renaissance of sorts. The main consumers have traditionally had European backgrounds, not that it matters where you're family originates from. The average Aussie would have preferred beer as the standard poison, I still do, though I have been known to drink anything (hide those moist ash trays folks!). As far as I know beer sales have steadily decreased over the years, but that could be a matter of changing trends and demographics as much as anything. See how I can get from studying to grog? Drop me a line and let me know your favoured brew.

						   I saw a TV show on Larry Clark tonight, all about his career from addict to photographer to film maker to addict again, pretty interesting. His whole approach to art and film seems to fight against the way young people are generally portrayed in the media. It brings out much of the reality that many young people face on a daily basis and how they are forced into adulthood from such early ages. This is becoming more and more relevant all the time, just look at how many young girls are dressing as their idols, Britney etc. It's like it's cool to look old, they aren't supposed to act their age and enjoy their own innocence while they still have some.  I have always been interested in Clark's work since I saw Kids, which had a great effect on my mind. I don't mean that it shocked me because of the nudity etc, I mean that someone was showing the real world situation of a bunch of kids, not simply dressing them up as naive imbeciles whose only thoughts are learning, rest and play. I was close in age to the subjects who were in the film, so it made it even more relevant. In my experience, while I can't say I related to all of the characters, I had heard of situations that were on a par with what happens and this only increased my admiration for the film, not to mention the script.  I know that many people out there hate Clark and think of him as a kiddy porn king, but I wouldn't be watching something like Kids at all considering I have personally known two paedophiles; if I thought there was something wrong with it. These disturbed persons were of good stading in the community and got away with abusing many children, right under the noses of adults. If I had known then what I know now I would have attempted to kick their arses despite my young age. But back onto Clark, I think he should at least be respected for giving a shit about younger people and showing what issues need to be out in the open for their sake. I really don't want to live in a world where my children (when I get there) start falling into drugs, become abused, get a Sexually Transmitted Disease, or anything else for that matter, simply because they are not educated about these things or these matters are swept under the carpet.

						   I guess I should explain a little about the title of this blog, it is a metaphor of sorts about how there is something you can see that is so far away, although it seems impossible to reach. I guess that I believe it can be reached, I don't mean that in some quasi-religious kind of way, but from more of an ambitious point of view, which is what I've been considering lately.  See, I have wanted to be an accountant for about 10 years now, but right now I feel about 50 times more like a writer. Yeah I know we have the opportunity to do more than one thing with our lives, but do I give a shit about number crunching? It's difficult to say, one thing I will say is that it seems to sap the creativity out of life and you begin talking about many things that you could care less about. On the other hand I don't mind working with figures and interpreting what they mean.  What can you expect to read on this blog? Well anything you could imagine would most likely be mentioned here, let me say that there are no boundries to the kinds of discussion that may take place. And if I'm lucky some of the work I produce for  urlLink www.thecheers.org   may just show up here too.

						   All work, no damn play, sounds like a bad day...enough with the rhyming though, I was having an interesting conversation with a couple of friends from out of town last night, they are a couple who is overloaded by work, so much so that finding time for one another is becoming more of a problem. I said 'I don't want to tell you how to live your life, but...' so I explained about how we should all have some time for our work, for ourselves and for each other. Now I know how much this sounds like 'Heal the World' crap, but even in my slightly plastered state (okay, so more beers and Baileys than I cared to remember)&nbsp;it seemed to make sense to more people than just myself. It had helped that I'd recently had the same conversation, but in a more theoretical fashion, it was about time management in general.   I don't know about the general public out there, but I'm very protective of the time I spend on making money and self-development against the relaxation and play time. I guess that is why you are seeing less blog postings too, but I still very much appreciate the opportunity to air my thoughts; I think this is one of the best ways to do it. I would much rather be poor, have some&nbsp;free time&nbsp;and be&nbsp;happy in a stable relationship than rich, stressed for any&nbsp;time to scratch my arse and divorced. Call me crazy. I think your location can have an impact on how you consider this part of your life, in the city it seems like there isn't the time to take that step back and consider just how much you have taken on, while where I'm from the focus is not so task oriented. This is a generalisation, but it makes sense...to me.

						   Just when you think everything is going to hell, you pass your Uni classes for the semester. Even with a failed assignment I managed to pull through, not bad for a guy who was going to change courses.

						   Is the Iraqi Prime Minister a cold blooded killer? The recent allegations make us all wonder about what our politicians get away with and whether they will ever be bought to justice. If you have no idea what I am talking about head on over to  urlLink http://www.theage.com.au &nbsp;where one of their highly regarded reporters have found two&nbsp;witnesses who allege that the Iraqi Prime Minister (the new one) executed around six or so insurgents to demonstrate to the Police what should be done when they catch them. I dunno about you but that just sounds like Democracy is already at work in the newly governed Iraq (not). If this is true it just shows how another criminal has been given too much power, in a world where many of our elected officials commit crimes that would make the rest of the population look good.  &nbsp;  If any one knows of a good web site program please drop me a line on my email, I&nbsp;am seriously thinking about creating a new site (this one will remain) because of a few new ideas I have had lately (too many ideas as usual). I'm not really into HTML, but I guess I'll learn. I'd prefer it if it did the code itself. Later.

						    Light Of The Quasar: Providing Choice For Australian High School Graduates     Getting High School Kids into further study &nbsp; urlLink   &nbsp;    What is an 'Education Precinct' all about? To summarise, it is the combination of a senior high-school campus with the various learning organisations that are available to them when they graduate, all combined at the one location. The primary benefits of this ‘one-stop-shop’ approach is to encourage those leaving&nbsp;high-school to continue study, increasing their chances at finding work and to provide a smoother transition from each learning organisation to the other.  &nbsp;  The concept is a new one and the first facility of this kind is due to open for business in Churchill, Victoria, Australia, next year. The initiative has been pushed by the Victorian Government as a model that may be used internationally. It will be part of the existing Gippsland Campus of Monash University and integrate a college that features training based on workplace situations, an on-the-job training group, education facilities for local government and the University itself.  &nbsp;  The idea underlying the Precinct is in sync with the needs of the Gippsland region itself, an area that has suffered through economic hardship for over a decade. The economic situation has had a great impact on the young people of the area. Youths who have seen their parents work in the local mining industry; have also seen many of those jobs taken away. This is also true of the decline in farming and the local retailers who relied on farmers and miners to support their income. Let me say that the incentive to achieve for a high-school student that wants to remain in Gippsland is not very high; a major reason for this is the lack of employment to replace what was lost.  &nbsp;  This mining industry was a state owned operation that centred on Gippsland’s Latrobe Valley. The major population centres were either formed for or expanded because of the need for more coal workers, the plants supplying the state’s power. In fact, one town that was in the area simply does not exist anymore, not even as a ghost town. Sounds strange, but it’s true, the whole town was dug up for the valuable coal that was underneath it. Little remains of what was once a town called Yallourn, apparently it was a nice place too, but just not nice enough to be spared, I guess.  &nbsp;  The change in state government and the emphasis on cutting debt brought a great amount of sales of government assets, regardless of their profitability. What were the Victorian government’s greatest assets? The power stations and the open cut mines that supported them. They were all in one place and trying to replace the jobs that would be lost by privatisation was not a concern of the pig-headed and arrogant state premier of the time. Re-training the workers who left was not an option either, despite how sensible that sounds. Many who left took the money and relocated to warmer places, therefore many Victorians would become Queenslanders overnight, with most going to Brisbane or The Gold Coast. Regardless of where they went; many were either unemployed or they simply retired (for those who could), this is what their sons or daughters had to look forward to? "Why bother trying to make something of yourself if you would end up on welfare too?" was the thought of many.  &nbsp;  Of the younger generation who had no problem with leaving the area and could, most would go to the state’s capital, Melbourne, where there was plenty of work, or interstate.&nbsp; Many saw this as something ‘cool’ to do, while that may be their opinion, I would like to think it was more about trying to find work than being ‘cool,’ besides many missed the place too much and came back (I guess they weren’t 'cool’ any more). Despite employment issues, many residents don’t realise what they have. The Latrobe Valley in particular is only a couple of hours away from everything. From the state capital Melbourne and national capital Canberra, the snowfields and alpine national parks, the rolling green hills and forests not to mention the beaches and fishing playground of Bass Strait (the watery bit that separates Victoria from the isle of Tasmania). There is much more to offer than would seem apparent, I think the Victorian Government realises this, thus the Precinct idea. More must be done for these people, but at least some people who live there are doing their part.  &nbsp;  If you know of an area in your part of the world where the young feel they have no incentive to study further, maybe this Education Precinct idea would be appropriate to encourage them to expand their learning.  &nbsp;  For information on the Education Precinct: http://www.gippsland.monash.edu.au/gep/index.shtml  For more on the Gippsland region check out: http://gippsland.com/&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Copyright Matt Holt, 2004

						   I reckon that Haitians have had a raw deal, I saw the movie  The Serpent And The Rainbow  again tonight for the first time in about five years, and even though the movie is primarily about supernatural and scientific themes, it reminds you of how a place that should be well governed, can be torn up. History itself tells us that foreign intervention has caused many of these problems, but also, occasionally worked towards keeping the country together. I think the founding fathers who kicked out the French would have preferred that the country had followed the course they charted, rather than the one that has brought revolution after revolution. It is a pity that Haiti's full potential is not being realised.  I'm trying to help a close friend learn to drive at the moment, but like all good things, time is necessary to improve abilities behind the wheel. It's a little strange doing the instructing to drive, when you can vividly remember when you, yourself were learning. Let me say that the mistakes that are being made are not all that different from the ones I made myself, which makes it easier to relate to one another.

						   Here is my last offering to The Cheers:   Warnings from the future   Continuing in my quest to talk about anything remotely interesting, I found http://www.johntitor.com and http://johntitor.strategicbrains.com These web sites and the story may be familiar to some web surfers, but I’ll explain a little anyway for those who need it. Keep in mind there are many people who believe in this story and many who think it is a complete waste of time; I, myself, am keeping an open mind.    John Titor (a.k.a. Timetravel_0) was a message poster in a few forums some years ago, and he had many different discussions about the future time he came from, being 2036. To put his story in a nutshell, the future he came from was a United States of America, post nuclear holocaust. Yeah, I know, it sounds crazy and impossible that anyone could have written that (including a local mental patient, sorry gramps). Just bear with me.    Like a modern-day Nostradamus, Titor gave cryptic descriptions of this future but some of what he had to say was downright explicit. The United States would suffer from a civil war, not of the North vs. South variety, but of those who wanted security against those who wanted freedom. so it was pretty much a city vs. country, government vs. militia, civil libertarian vs. oppressive regime, war that would rage for years. If that is not enough death and destruction for you, than wait until you hear what happened next! Russia sided with the American rebels and released its nuclear arsenal (drop the n-a-l off the back and you have the Australian version of ass, sorry I just had to), upon Europe, China and the USA. This was seen as a great thing by the rebels in America as the nukes targeted the cities, the location of their enemies, giving them the opportunity to take back their country, which they did.    That’s all well and good I suppose, for Titor’s ‘good guys,’ but what about the rest of the world? Canada is supposed to be full of bad arse psychos, presumably because of the fighting for scarce resources, either that or they’re just sick of being so cold (don’t worry guys, some Australians are sick of being so hot). South America gets off relatively unscathed, but there is still a substantial amount of gun-fighting going around. Europe sounds like a big radioactive crater. China fires her nukes at Australian cities, and I’m not sure of where else, Russia, US, I suppose. China tries to invade Australia but gets repelled (it is possible, remember World War II, with Japan?). I’m not sure about any other countries, but if anyone knows about them, please let me know. Let me just say that I hope none of this really does happen, but I would not be madly surprised either.    From any of this, can we see any patterns that may indicate Titor was for real? Recent human rights violations, in the name of security (not just in the United States), have been occurring more frequently. Guantanamo Bay detention, Abu Ghraib prison, most of the war in Iraq, refugees detained in Australia and Europe, and an Afghan beaten by contractor are part of the showcase of humiliation and ‘throw the key away’ initiatives that are linked with governments who are more concerned with security than dignity. With all that has happened in the last few years, is it really that strange to imagine the world being messed up as described in Titor’s words? Yes, it is obviously possible. Maybe we should accept it as a warning of what is to come if people don’t demand change, and NOW. Get writing those letters to your local representative about what you value, the kind of environment you want to live in, how you’d like to see other people treated (not like dogs, I imagine- no offense Pluto). The time has come to end cycles of revenge and violence, human beings are the only ones who can do it.    Whether Titor was real or not is no longer the issue, the real message is simple. Learn from the past and plan for the future, or it is going to look nasty. Titor said something to the effect, why are people in this time so worried about time travellers messing up the future, when they make it worse every day? I’ll leave you with that to consider.&nbsp;    Copyright Matt Holt, 2004

						   I think Senator John Edwards is the perfect running-mate for John Kerry, he brings some life into the whole campaign and seems to have some credibility to boot. Maybe there is some hope for the Democrats yet.  Finally saw  Underworld  today, pretty good, not sure if I'd buy it, but I really appreciated the idea that no one is essentially good or evil in it. Good to see Bill Nighy from Love Actually, the guy sure is versatile, but I have seen him in some other quite good roles before this. Hell, okay, it is probably worth buying. I know people will give me shit over this, but Mandy Moore's  Chasing Liberty  is quite a good little package, and I found I was amazed that I found it so funny, even after seeing her acting chops in that other more Christian-y movie  A Walk To Remember .

						   Has anyone seen the footage on the news of a car in a roof? Some mad woman in the US backed off a high car park, into an old guys roof, so we're forever left with the image of the front of a car sticking out of the top of a house. I'm sure it was an accident, but then again. The neighbourhood seemed a little too enthusiastic about the event, obviously not allot happens there too often, although if that ever happened to my place I'm sure I'd be talking allot about it too (albeit in the most pissed off of ways).  My first Editing assignment is ready to go to Bondi, although I haven't done allot of work for the course yet, I do enjoy the course structure and actually feel like I'm learning something for a change. For all those in Australia who like to write and want to help improve on it, I suggest you check out the Australian College of Journalism, they're on the web too. And as a further endorsement, thriller author and former model Tara Moss has studied there too.

						   I may not be spending so much time blogging because of the screen play, not just my Cheers articles. Why do I want to do so many things, but there simply is not enough time? Wish I knew too.  Full Metal Jacket is going to be on SBS TV on Sunday night, can't wait haven't seen it for awhile, really dig those Stanley Kubrick (hope I spelt that right) movies. Vincent D is really good as the messed up private. The whole thing kind of reminds me of what is going down in Iraq and Afghanistan at the moment.  I'll be back on here blogging again sometime around Monday or Tuesday as I'll be out of town. If I had a lap-top that would not be so much of an issue, but you have to have money to have those sort of things! Later.

						   Feels like I've got 'writer's block' going on at the moment, and little of anything else...I put it down to the winter blues. You know what I mean? That problem people have where they get depressed in winter? I think I've got that, but I'm not pissed at the world or anything, just can't focus on writing anything. It's like all of a sudden I've got the attention span of a goldfish. I can't think of anything to write (which is really bad, since my life lives off my ideas), and my studies are not progressing too well either. It could be that I need a holiday, or maybe just some time in the sunshine, whatever the case, let's just hope I can get back to the literal diarrhea that I was doing. In better news I've created a web site that will house my movie reviews, I'll get back to you on the exact location, but it feels like a step in the right direction for me, considering my movies obsessions.
