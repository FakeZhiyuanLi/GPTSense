      I just realized today that this is one of only very few places that opened today for business. Besides the fact that it sucks because it's Monday, it sucks I have to work on Memorial Day. I have memories too! I would like to remember... my dog Snoppy who died and when to Doggie-Heaven a couple of years back! See, I should be free for the day!  Instead, I get tons of work. Looks like my boss planned all weekend on what I should do, seeing that I'm only working today and tomorrow for rhis week. Then, it's off to party and celebrate for the 5+ years I spent busting my butt at college! Hopefully I'll be able to rest during this period and come back re-energized next week. Working on the same code over and over and over and over again can be boring.  Yesterday I didn't post because of how hectic it was, as my normal Sundays are. I have to scramble and check that I'm taking everything to my apartment, make sure to don't forget anything, visit my girlfriend, then go home, say goodbye to my mom and then leave for the two-hour drive to the apartment. Every week I leave something behind. This week was a towel, which I had to urgently stop by Wal-Mart and buy. Last week it was my cell phone's charger. Sprint wanted me to cough up $40 for a new one, so I spent the whole week using the phone like 10-15 minutes a day so the battery wouldn't die out. As long as my most important belongings don't stay behind (my laptop, Gameboy Advance, cell phone and CDs, in that order) then I'm good to go for the week.  Let me finish what I'm doing to see if the boss could be happy seeing that I'm working my tail off to leave everything running smoothly while I'm gone. A new technician is coming in to work a part time this week while I'm gone. I was supposed to fix PCs, but since the higer-ups saw I knew how to program, they stuck me here, which is cool because I get so bored fixing computers! Plus, I get to create new things that are going to be used in the entire company, so that's an added bonus. So before I get fired, as I always fear, let me leave this post here. Have a great Memorial Day, and remember your loved ones and even the ones you don't love, don't be so selfish! :)

      I never thought it could be true, until I bought DDRMax 2 for the Playstation 2 today. That's Dance Dance Revolution for you acronym-less peeps (Did I just invent a word?), or that 'big machine with music and lights and jumping people all around it.' I don't have a PS2, but my girlfriend's brother has one lying in his room gathering the dust bunnies. I just felt like buying it, really spontaneous as usual. I just thought it would be good for a couple of laughs, but my girlfriend really wanted it, and since I was in a very giving mood today, I bought the game and two dance mats. I tried playing the game once in the arcade, but I blew $1 in less than 30 seconds. A truly pathetic sight.  See, let me explain my evolution of Revolution (nice rhymes!) in terms of what I thought of the game. At first, I thought " That's not gonna work, I won't be seeing that game in arcades in the next couple of months ."  Then, it was " The game's pretty cool and has hot music, but I'm never, EVER playing that in front of people! " Finally, it was " Ahh, what the hell, let me try it out once in my life. " My entire DDR career in the arcades lasted less than a minutes. I swore never to play the game again.  Here in the present, I just played it once to test it out in the PS2, then I tried it two times, three times, and when I least expected it, I played for almost two hours straight, gasping for air, completely drenched in sweat, just toally wasted (in a good way!). My feet hurt, my legs are going to be sore tomorrow, and I'll probably sleep 12 hours tonight. But in a way, I was so proud of myself, because that probably was the first exercise routine I completed in the past 9 months! That game really gives you a workout, and there's an article in  urlLink Yahoo!  that backs up the story.  Every weekend whenever I come down to my home town (another rhyme! I'm on fire today, baby!) I'll be playing DDR non-stop until I get better at the game and slim down a couple of extra pounds. At least in the gaming part I've become pretty good, almost mastering the 'Light' setting. In the next couple of weeks I'm heading to the 'Standard' difficulty and in a few weeks, maybe I'll be good enough for the 'Heavy' stuff. Plus, I need to trim a couple of pounds, like about 40! See, the problem is that I'm tall, and while I look a little pudgy, I'm not like South Park's Eric Cartman fat. Most people think I'm 220, when I'm actually 260. Trust me, I'll post pics in my moblog later this week to prove I don't look fat, I'm probably just a little big-boned :)  Well, time to hit the sack, I've spent all the enerygy I had for the weekend. Plus, today I had to wake up early to pick up my cap and gown for my graduation! Hooray for me! I'll also post thos pics when I have the chance. My girlfriend's going to lend me her digital camera, so this week you'll have at least 20 new pictures.  Anyway, everyone have a good night, sleep tight, and come back another day to read my blog! ( Please??? )

      Ahh, there's nothing like being home again, close to your loved ones, and not feeling so alone. You probably think life sucks for me when I'm not with my family, but it's still pretty good. I just learned how to appreciate being around caring, loving people. But still, it's sometimes good to be alone and just watch DVDs or play video games without anyone bothering you!  I don't have much of a DVD collection, but I do treasure it, especially my South Park seasons! I'm a huge fan of South Park, and when I talk about it, I laugh at myself because I sound like a total nerd! For example, my girlfriend showed me a background of Cartman sitting in a chair, and I immediatly said something like " Oh yeah, that's from an episode in the sixth season when the kids were having a contest to see who would take Kenny's place after he died. " After I said that, I just stood there and thought about what I just said and I just started laughing so hard at myself. I'm a master of poking fun at myself. I'll usually go out of my way to make people laugh at my expense. Just ask my high school classmates. Pretty good period in my life, even though I failed miserably in one class for not going... Another story for another time!  I must sleep, for tomorrow I have to go get my cap and gown for next week's graduation! I'll post pictures of that later in the week. Just in case you didn't notice, I set up a  urlLink moblog  (Web log of pictures) that hopefully I'll fill with pictures this next week. I'll see if I can fit pictures from my apartment, my room, my workplace, and just about any other places I find interesting. That'll let some people come into my world, and see some pictures of probably one of the most beautiful places on Earth, Puerto Rico! It's probably not much, but I love my little island :)  I would really like people to read this, and also that they enjoy it, because I don't want to think I'm wasting my time writing for only myself! In any case, it's good just to vent out your frustrations or express your happiness out to the world, even if it's sometimes. I've been posting a lot lately, and I hope to post at least once a day to keep this active. Once I get Internet at my apartment, I'll really be posting a lot of stuff! So good night everyone, and for those of you in other time zones, good morning / afternoon / evening! Have a fine day tomorrow!

      Nothing beats the combination of having a great lunch with great food, and knowing that in a few hours I'll be free for the weekend! Besides that, next week I'm having most of the week off from work for my graduation! That's right, yours truly finally graduated from college. Well, technically I graduated in December, when I finished my Bachelors Degree, but I don't consider myself graduated until I'm in that cap and gown! Plus, I have a chance to rub it in my professors, since I graduated with honors and most of them thought I wouldn't even finish college. Granted, that was after a very rough and shaky first year, but that's another story that'll be posted probably later on.  If anyone has actually read this blog before now, you might had noticed that my picture is now up on my profile! It's from last Christmas, but I really haven't changed a bit in the past months. I guess people feel more comfortable reading other people's stuff when they have a visual of what that person looks like. Or probably it shows that the person isn't someone who's goofing off on the web. At least that's the way it works for me.  I really love my job today. No one is bothering me, I've been able to create a couple of extra modules for my company's system without anyone asking me to do them, so there's some extra points in my favor! Hey, in this day and age of uncertainty, especially in the workplace, it helps to be indispensable.  Speaking of which, I honestly think that right now if the company fired me, they'll have a hell of a time finding a replacement. Not that I'm blowing my own horn or anything, it's that I do so many different things that I honestly think I'm seriously underpaid. I learned early in my college experience that it's better to know a something of everything than to know a lot of only one thing. That's why I chose to work with computers and programming; there's so many paths to choose from. It helps to know about different stuff. I should end this blog entry and later on write my comments on what all aspiring computer geeks should learn to help them in the real world. Have a great day, and be happy about the weekend!

      I'm feeling so much better today. I feel like I could take on the world today. Huge change from these past couple of days. What's wrong with me? Let me see, could it be I had a full 8 hours of sleep for the first time in weeks? Or could it be I had a non-rushed breakfast ever since I've been living solo? Hmmm... oh yeah, there's something like the weekend coming up soon... IT'S FRIDAY!!! WHOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!  Ok, enough of the pathetic screams and dances, I swear anyone who would've seen me would be laughing their butts off for the next day or so. Anyway, there's a couple of interesting news, so I like to share my opinion.  - Yesterday I mentioned hot the so-called "Pirate Act" would allow anyone to be prosecuted for sharing copyrighted files. Well, seems like Italy wants to one-up the United States, and  urlLink approved a law  in which anyone caught downloading illegal files will be thrown in jail for  up to three years . Ouch, better start deleting all these P2P programs and "research" MP3s you people have collected throught the years...  -  urlLink Spam is bad , at least for some poor guy in Buffalo, New York. A couple of weeks ago, he was sued by Earthlink and was ordered to pay up $16,000,000 (that's 16 million dollars to you common folks). After the civil suit, he was again sued for 14 criminal charges including stealing identities and using the stolen IDs to send more than  800 millon  (800,000,000 for us common folk) spam messages. Besides losing all that money, he'll have to serve a 3.5 - 7 year jail sentence. I hope this starts taking away the Junk E-Mail from my inbox. I receive like 20 spam messages a day, which is little, but that's about 75% of the E-Mails I receive daily. I can only imagine people who receive thousands of E-Mails a day. It must be tough being a celebrity!  - I really find it so amusing the tech headlines that are posted daily in some sites. For example, some people follow so closely  urlLink how much Microsoft spends on security , or the  urlLink dates Microsoft is going to release their products , when most of the times they miss by months. Some people may find this interesting, but I really don't care! Most people I know don't care either. The funniest newsbyte of all time I found was that someone posted online a scan of the Windows XP 64-Bit Edition CDs, just to show he had them... Do we care? I hope you have fun play around with the software, but I don't give a damn if you really have the CDs or not. Will seeing the CD covers make my life better? Will I be able to sleep comfortably at night? Is this really newsworthy? Guess those sites have to update the content every day, no matter how much crap they post.  Well, as I'm finishing part of what the boss wanted me to do today, it'll be a two-hour drive home for the weekend. The drive is too long, down a risky road (miles of hairpin curves for about an hour), but it's worth it to see the ones you love and miss so much when you're alone in the opposite part of the country. So even if you wish you could live alone with no one to bother you, think about it again, because it sucks not knowing anyone where you have to live and being alone most of the time. I never knew how to love the weekends so much before I moved here.  Anyway, thanks to my blog, I know that eventually someone will read this and it'll be better, because it feels like I'm talking to these people. So thanks for reading, and I hope you have a great day, I will too after 4:00 PM!

      Ok, I know there are a lot of people who absolutely hate their work, hate where they work, hate who they work with. I'm not in that category. I love my job, although stressful at times, I really appreciate what I do. I know tons of people who majored in computers and are working in something totally opposite. I also like where I work, normally I'm alone in my office and can do whatever I want, and later say I did tons of work. But please don't tell anyone that :). I also get along well with my co-workers, even if some of them cause me huge morning headaches.  But right now I'm hating it all. I'm hating my job, my co-workers, and especially my workplace. I don't know, it's just one of those days when I hate almost everything, one of those 'I-woke-up-on-the-wrong-side-of-the-bed' days. It won't last though, as I'm too nice a person to let something hateful stay inside me for long periods of time.  There are little things that annoy me, which I don't let them get to me, but those small things really suck. For example, there's no way anyone could work with 5-6 kids (co-workers children) next door to my office and listening to them laughing and their parents telling them to shut up. Another thing is when someone doesn't do his/her job and trying to place the blame on me. This was the cause of the early morning headaches.  Also, the kids mentioned before are sucking all the bandwidth off the network, checking out their Barbie, Spongebob and other assorted animated characters. Being a web developer isn't easy. Especially when some people don't like when you change the way the Intranet works and demand you do the same thing, but leaving it as close as the way it was before. Huh? Either you want the change, or you don't, it's that simple.  Oh well, it's Thursday afternoon, meaning I'll be leaving to my in about 26 more hours. Hopefully the headaches will stay in my office and won't follow me in my two-hour drive home. I really,  really  hope you all are having a great day, since I sure as hell won't be having one today! Thanks to the good ol' blog, I feel better, knowing that probably someone, someday will read this and feel the way I do right now.

      I don't think it's healthy to have a headache this early in the morning... So a big thanks to some of my co-workers for this!  -  urlLink Is this cool or what?  I really hope Nintendo sticks it to Sony and their PSP (PlayStation Portable, look it up if you never seen it), and to Microsoft if they throw their hat into the portable gaming arena (which is likely, seeing that they would love to get their hands on a big chunk of the pie). Nintendo, show all these people who's king! ( At least in the handheld world )  - Looks like  urlLink American Idol  finished it's third season last night. I personally didn't watch because I don't have cable in my apartment. I watched last year's final episodes, and I realized that I  hate  Clay Aiken. Anyway, I think Fox has a gigantic cash cow on their hands, and they're milking it for all it's worth. As long as there's imitations like  urlLink Puerto Rico's version of Idol , you know you can keep on bring it each and every year.  - The record industry (or RIAA) seems that they're going to have their way soon, thanks to the U.S. Department of Justice. A proposal dubbed ' urlLink Piracy Act ' is currently waiting on the Senate to vote for it. If it passes, then thousands could be directly sued, with fines up reaching more than hundreds of thousands of dollars. That's a lot of money! Of course, the RIAA is rooting on the Act, in order to "stop diminishing sales and downloaders who have thousands of songs". Of course, most of the people that have been sued only have less than probably 50 songs, and with CDs selling almost $20, I wouldn't blame them for downloading. So all my fellow puerto ricans, stop the Kazaa / Limewire downloading now!  The only question on my mind is, has someone from Puerto Rico been sued? If there's actually someone reading this from Puerto Rico, and knows someone who's been called up by the RIAA, let me know, so I can post it here and let everyone know.  Creating this blog wasn't a bad idea, as my headache is almost gone. Hopefully certain people will leave me alone for the rest of the day, like that's gonna happen... Hope everyone has a great day, see ya later when I post again!

      This is my third post today, but it's something I forgot to mention before...  This past week, a powerful storm hit the Caribbean, affecting many countries, Puerto Rico included. But none worse than Haiti and the Dominican Republic, which as of this time, more than 500 people have died, not counting at least a hundred still missing. Most of the people who died were sleeping when the flood hit their town, making it virtually unescapable.  This weekend was a rainy one here in Puerto Rico, with a couple of flood warnings here and there. I never thought it could be enough to kill people. Just comes to show you how deadly nature can be, and how sudden life can change for anyone. My thoughts and prayers go out to everyone who lost someone over there. We're so close to them, yet I feel far away considering how much damage was made.  Life is very precious, treasure it forever...

      I'll try to make this a staple in my blog, just a mindless post of whatever's on my mind.  - Am I the only person in Puerto Rico who hasn't seen  Shrek 2  this past week? I went this past Saturday at 3:00 PM, only to find out all the tickets were sold out in all three theaters until  11:00 PM ! Maybe I'll be lucky and be able to check it out this weekend during the daytime.  - I finally cracked and bought myself a Nintendo Gamecube. I swore off gaming consoles when I souped up my PC and got the latest titles that couldn't compare to whatever the PSI, xebec or Gamecube was offering. But after playing games like  Super Mario Sunshine, Mario Kart: Double Dash, and The Legend of Zelda , I couldn't resist buying it, especially in these lonely and boring times alone in my apartment.   Metroid Prime   is one of the best games ever!  - There's a lot of commotion going in the Linux and Open-Source world. I personally love Linux and use it for most of my daily tasks (except gaming, the one gigantic hole Linux has yet to seal). I really don't care who wrote the Linux code, if it was stolen from Unix or Minix or any other *nix. They should focus on making it better, and let's see if Linux can finally take off on the desktop like analysts (whoever they are) have been telling for several years.  That's about all I have now, let me get back to work before I'm fired! :)

      Hey everyone!  This is my first post ever on a blog, so hooray for me! After swearing never to create a blog, here I am. I always found it strange that people would post their thoughts and feelings on the web and think there would be this huge following of readers who would be interested.  Then it happened...   I started faithfully reading other people's blogs!!!    So I thought  "What the hell? Let me see if anyone would be interested to read my endless ramblings?"  Which brings us to this moment in time. Hopefully I can post something at least 4 -5 times a week from my job (no 'Net currently at the apartment. Besides, I'll post during my breaks, honest!)  So I really hope you enjoy this blog, and please give me your feedback, either by E-Mail or by Instant Messenger (look it up in my profile). Thanks for reading, hope everyone's having a great day!

      Don't you just like the feeling of something new? I recently bought a car, and there's nothing like driving in a shiny new vehicle. Also, I bought a Gamecube, and there's nothing like playing a brand new video game in it. Where is this leading to? I consider myself to be a geek, as I love anything that has to do with computers or video games. So it's no wonder I'm happy about the release of a new  browser .  That's right, the brand new  urlLink Mozilla Firefox 0.9  has been released. For those who haven't heard of it, it's an alternate browser to Microsoft's Internet Explorer, with lot a nice features built in. It includes a pop-up blocker, for all those people who enter those sites for "educational purposes" and get a screen full of pop-ups. My favorite addition to this browser is the tabbed browsing feature. Instead of opening 10 different browser windows, you can have only one window open, with multiple tabs on top to flip to another site. It works perfectly, even with different plugins, like Adobe Reader.  Seriously, for those of you who haven't tried this browser, give it a go. You have nothing to lose, besides moving from one browser to another. Or at least let your friends know about it. And in case you've been looking for an E-Mail client to go with the new browser, check out  urlLink Mozilla Thunderbird . By the way, did I mention both of these products are  completely free ? Isn't that the greatest!  Well, take care, happy downloading and have a great day test-driving the new browser!

      I'm bored, most of my friends are on the beach, I'm hungry and tired. But nothing can bring my spirits down, because it's Friday! If that alone doesn't cheer me up, there should be something seriously wrong with me. Besides going home for the weekend, I also get paid every Friday afternoon. With a new car and everything, I can't be spending it like I did to basically every paycheck I received before. But it's cool, since I have a new ride and that's the most important thing. But before leaving, I want to share what's on my mind about certain newsbytes.  - Am I the only one who finds it amusing that a software compnay bundled their software with their rivals in order to "prove" they're the best? That's what Linspire is going right now. The company formerly known as Lindows is promoting and selling a Linux bundle that includes Linspire, Fedora and Mandrake, just to compare which one is best. They even have a cheesy  urlLink website  that "shows which is best". Of course, they give their product five stars and the others way lower ratings. I think the idea of Linspire is cool for beginners, but for other people, I think this really, really sucks. Especially with Mandrake 10, since I really think it's a really superior product. The best Linux distro I've tried yet.  - I've been playing Metroid Prime non-stop. But yesterday, as I'm moving to mostly underwater levels, I found something weird. Whenever I use the wave beam, the flash of the beam creates a lighting effect where you can see Samus' face. I admit, Samus does have pretty eyes, especially for a bounty hunter, but it still freaks me out whenever I see it. It's like a ghost is looking at you or something. Very freaky...  - Who's gonna win the hardware? Hopefully the Pistons will show that a multi-million spending team like the Lakers doesn't automatically mean winning the championship. I like both teams, but so far the Pistons have really surprised me, especially after game 3 where they won by 20 points. Brings back very good and fond memories of 1998, when the Chicago Bulls beat the Utah Jazz 96-54, breaking the mark for lowest points by a team ever. Good times indeed!  - Rest in peace, Reagan. I was too young to remember his presidency, but it seems like he was a great president, especially in the times when the U.S. was enemies with a lot of other nations, especially the Soviet Union superpowers. Reading about those times, it's pretty scary what could have happened if a war broke out between these two nations.  Well, my mind is blank again, hopefully I'll be able to post again this weekend. But I'll be too occupied with other things, and spending some quality time for myself! So have a great day, and a great weekend too!

      I've been meaning to post for the past couple of days, but too much work has left me with so little time. I'm supposed to be busy now, but as an old junker installs Windows 2000, I think I have enough time to post something. My boss is keeping me really busy with different projects. I feel like my head's about to blow! But that's the way life is, if you don't work, you don't progress in life or get paid, whichever you prefer!  I'm pretty angry at the moment, a couple of thing going on that I don't like. First off, last week I had three days off, which I thought were going to be marked as vacation with pay. But yerterday when I received my check, I was only paid the two days I worked. This certainly sucks because I was counting on that money to pay for my new car. Second, my co-workers just love to place the blame on other people. I mean, if something wrong happened and it was my fault, I would just say so. But around the workplace it's way different. If you do something wrong, just pass it on to someone else. It happened to be a couple of times this week, not counting the past couple of weeks. I'll just stay calm, as long as it doesn't affect me or my job.  I am in serious need of a night out, but seeing that my budget it tighter than I expected it to be, that won't happen in a while. At least where I'm staying during the weekdays, there are no good places to hang out at night. And it's weird, seeing that there are a couple of universities in town, and there are a lot of students around. If there's one thing I miss about being in the U.S., it's the lifestyle. In a sense, it's much more quiet and calm here in Puerto Rico, but sometimes I find that too boring. I don't know, sometimes I'm too quiet, other times I would just like to go out and party all night long. I'm conflicted in some ways :)  Well, it's 5:00, so that means quitting time! I don't like Thursday nights, normally I'm busting my butt cleaning my room and packing everything to take home with me. But on Friday afternoons, it's well worth it! Take care everyone, thanks for reading my boring stuff, and hopefully I'll post again soon!

      Well, looks like my mini-vacation has finally come to an end. I had so much fun these past 5 days. From my graduation, to going to the beach, to buying a new car, it was the best couple of days I've spent in a very, very long time. So it should be normal that I think today officially sucks!  The day after my graduation, I went to the beach with my brother, his wife and my girlfriend. We went to a beach so secluded that we were there for more than 5 hours and no one else appeared! It rocked having a beach all to ourselves. That beach is next to a summer house that I went to when I was in high school. The parents of a schoolmate rented the house for the weekend, and I spent an entire day there. It was probably one of the best days in my high school life. So going there again brought back some good memories. I don't have too many good memories, but whenever they come back, it's fun to remember those times!  I also got a new car! A Toyota Corolla 2004, to be precise. I needed a ride, because I was using my mom's car to get here to work, while she was using my sister's car. That was five months ago, so I had to do something! I didn't have any credit at all, which meant being rejected by every car dealer in my area. I checked the last one out, before going in and settling for an older car. That dealer treated me very nice, mostly because a sale for them would mean $$$ in commisions! They checked out my credit, and gave me a chance. So now I have a new toy!  It was a great week, hopefully I'll have another week soon as good as this one. One can only hope for it. Hope everyone's having a great day. See you all later!

           That's me after the graduation ceremony, holding up the ever-present symbolic diploma. It's finally official, I'm a college graduate! Granted, in Puerto Rico it isn't too rare for someone to graduate from any college, seeing that tuition is about 90% cheaper than in the states. To put into contrast, my university currently charges $135 per credit, and it's probably the most expensive school here. That's about $4000 per school year. Compare that to $20,000+ in really good universities in the U.S.! So I didn't mind studying in the 'expensive' university.  I didn't think I would be sad or emotional during the ceremony. But I saw some old friends, and it was actually a fun graduation, not a boring one where all the presidents and whoever is considered important talk on and on and on. I started thinking about all the cool times I spent, not thinking about the hellish days I had early on in my college years. I thought about not being a student again, and missing the social interaction only college can provide. I'll miss learning new things, although I usually learn on my own. I'll miss the little things more than anything else in the world.  Most of my fellow graduates will be entering a harsh reality soon, when they realize they won't be working soon for what they studied all these years for. Some, like myself, were extremely lucky to obtain a job in what they majored in. I really wish and pray that everyone who honestly busted their tail in class to earn a better living will get a decent job sooner rather than later. It sucks having a great education, even a Masters, and still not get a job outside of fast-food joints.  In any case, I posted some pics on my moblog from the graduation, which you can see by clicking the link on the sidebar. There you can see some of my family who rooted me on in my graduation. They were the ones who helped me out the most, so I'll be eternally grateful to them. Today my brother took me to the beach, and besides having a nice sunburn which I'll feel tomorrow morning, I had a rockin' time! I forgot to take the camera, so no pics to post :( I'll try to snap some pics soon and post them. It's better to see a picture than read a thousand words! Until next time, have a nice day (or night, wherever you are!)

      As the hour grows closer, I'm getting more excited by the minute! These past couple of days have been normal, and I didn't feel the slightest happiness because of my graduation. As far as I was concerned, I already graduated and had a stable job in the field I majored in, so the graduation would be just a small bonus. But lately people around me noticed that I wasn't making the graduation thing a biggie. They were actually more excited as I was! But my friends actually made me realize how special this event is, especially thinking it'll be the last graduation I'll be part of, seeing that I don't want to spend the time, money or energy to pursue a Masters Degree.  This is a one in a lifetime opportunity. This is like finishing high school, or getting married, which hopefully will be a once-in-a-lifetime event also! It'll only happen once in your life, which makes it that much special. Besidea, after five and a half years of sweat, blood and tears (well, no blood, but there were times I almost burst into tears!) I think I deserve the finishing touch to my formal education. This will finally make official that I'm a college graduate and I'm a Computer Science major, which is probably the geekiest thing ever, but it rocks in my mind!  Today will truly be a day of celebration, as I finally end the chapter about my college career. I'm not too sad, like a lot of my fellow raduates are, because the end of the partying and fun is ending. I didn't do much of that, but in any case I look at it as a new chapter. A new chapter that has already begun in my life. And believe it or not, I'm having more fun now than when I was in college. Believe me, it isn't too shabby receiving a nice paycheck every week, much better than spending all your money on tuition, transportation and food!  I'll have tons of picture, since I leave my house going to the graduation, during the graduation and afterwards. So that I will definitely post in the moblog tomorrow or in the weekend. There's finally going to be more pictures! In any case, have a rockin' day, just like I'll have! To anyone who graduates / has graduated, my congratulations and well wishes to you! And to those who are still struggling through the college years, keep it up, 'cause in the end it'll be all worth it!

      Sometimes I wonder if I can survive a couple of weeks without technology. I've grown so used to tech stuff that I wonder if it were all taken away from me, if I could have a happy life. I'm serious, I don't know what I would do without my cell phone, my laptop, my video games, my television, my Internet, and just about everything else.  If I'm bored, what do I do? Go play Gamecube or some Gameboy Advance. If I need social interaction, where do I go to? Go online and chat with friends of use my cell phone to call someone up. If I'm hungry and want something quick, where do I direct my attention? The microwave, of course. Without these things, I would feel so lost.  Can anyone get so dependent on technology, that they actually think the things they use daily have existed for all their lives? I think I'm guilty as anyone who works in this line of work. Lately the use of technology has been more frequent. I'm spending way too many minutes of my cell phone ( Thank God for unlimited plans! ) and the countless hours spent playing Metroid Prime have been growing with each passing week. Plus, I've realized I left my Gameboy Advance behind, so lately I've been playing Superstar Saga and leveling up, to try to kill the last boss. He doesn't let me have a chance against him! By the way, if you own a GBA and haven't played this awesome game, you should go and buy it NOW!  Today is the end of my working week, so I'm psyched up about that! So let me go finish some work and actually earn my pay today! Have a great day, and don't do anything I would!
