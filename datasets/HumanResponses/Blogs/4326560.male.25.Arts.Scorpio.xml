This was my life, all my time,all my worthless fucking heart, This and the pipe, my only crime, but I was found guilty from the start, Back in one hour,		 Going into the light, I climb,  I play my part.  Here's my heart, I wear it on my sleeve, Always a man apart, always have I to solemnly greive, Back in a minute, I fly like a dart, I finally leave.  This is a note, written by a man who only used to be, Like the words that he wrote,  it's only a tale of what once was me, Back in due time, You all were so quick to demote, but am I blind?, or can I just not see?  Here goes the life, love, electric heartbeat,  goodbye, don't miss it, Don't even waste one woeful worrisome wooing cry, dismiss it, Back on Tuesday, maybe, I am the forgotten freak of a failure, so i'll fly,its not so sad,is it?  These are the words, on the note, that I leave on the front door, every single day, Except it shook me to my core to admit defeat, so ,back in 5 is all it'll ever say, Back in 5, Into some happy place maybe i'll float, and finally make the score,but I know what you all will always say.

      BLINDED BY THE SMOKE, I TRY TO MAKE SENSE OF IT ALL,  WHEN MY SANITY BROKE,THE BUMP IN THE ROAD THAT CAUSED ME TO FALL,  FROM STANDARDS,FROM VALUE,AND WILL,  AS I SIT AND CHOKE,ANSWERING TO THE PIPES BECON CALL.   CONSUMED BY THE LIKES OF RAGE, I TRY TO TRY TO TRY AND FAIL,  ENTOMBED BY THE BARS OF THIS CAGE,I ASK WHY AND WHY AND WHY BUT TO NO AVAIL,  TO A GOD, TO A FRIEND, AND MYSELF,  RESUMED BY THE WAR I WAGE, I CRY AND CRY AND CRY ENOUGH TO FILLA PALE.   EXITED THE WORLD YOU CALL REAL, TOO LONG AGO TO EVER COME BACK,  INSPECTED THE WAYS I FALL AND FEEL, TOO STRONG TO NEVER FALL OFF TRACK,  INTO DARKNESS,INTO THE LIGHT AND IN BETWEEN,  RESTED ON LAURELS TRUE YET NOT FOR REAL,TOO WRONG TO SEVER THE TIES AND FIX THE CRACK.  BOUND BY LIES, LIKE BARBBED WIRE AROUND OUR WRISTS, SOUNDS OF CRIES, LIKE BLOODSHED UNDER BRUISED FISTS,  BEAT YOU, BEAT ME, BEAT THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD AND THEN ILL BE KING,  AROUND THE FLIES, LIKE ANOTHER SHIT EATING BUG THAT JUST CANT RESIST.

      Misery, my only solitairy and darkened friend, There at birth, as you will surely be at the bitter end, My only companion, Nothing you are, all ive ever had to depend.  Sadness, sorrow And doubt, my only family to care for me, Madness,to borrow and still be without,emotional phantoms of my world, imaginary, My dear siblings, If I had this tomorrow, id go without,orphaned in a dormitory.

      These tears I cry, like rambling rivers of agony streaming down my face, The propaganda that I buy , like shivers inside of me spelling out disgrace, This is all for nothing,   Is this real, am I ?, like slivers of irony who sell me out to deface.   These stifled gasps of pain, like water damned up at a reservoir of emotion, The falling drops of rain ,  like  I cannot stand up  in a world full of so much motion,  These are all a waste, There is no real loss or gain, like  I  am all crammed up in my own worthless devotion.  These ruins of yesterdays dreams, like discarded hopes and shattered glass, The truth, and what it seems, like retarded dopes who have scattered out in a great mass, They are all just taking up space, In unified chaotic teams, there ready to take the pass.   These scars on my skin made by you all, I can never forget what you’ve done to me, The bars  and the sin that by nature do call,they will never ever let me be free, All of this is bullshit, I look up at the stars again but all I see is this fucking brick wall,are there really any stars to see?    These  aches and torment of torture and hate, like the love I was to feel in a perfect place, The fakes who adorn it like its fortunate and great,. Like this is not real ,just one big disgrace, One big play full of players, Lakes of scorn hit me at a terminal rate, and I squeel so loud, yet noone hears my debate.   These sad eyes that will forever stare on into a void, like  the big black lie you all tell, The twisted fucking morals you’ve all so foolishly employed, like the layer of lye that covers your rotten smell,, Sherrades time is over, No more guessing the truth you cannot avoid, as you stand in line to be sentenced in hell.

      Here I sit , a broken man , Because the pieces of me just don’t fit , even though ive done all I can, And my head just spins in violent circles ,  I don’t do shit , though I know I can.  Here I am , a waste of space, Like spoiled spam, an ugly face, And I cant seem to do anything correctly, This life : a sham ,this sham : a disgrace.  Here I stay , in an illusion of my past, Where I run away , but reality catches up real fast , And I weaken at the very thought of coping , This , and everyday, my soul is harassed.  Here I fucking stagnate , and I know you’ve heard it all before , Taken all I can take, why would any human be expected to take any more? ,  And I know my choice is my damnation , So I dwell in a sad state , somewhere between  the outside world and the front door.  Here I scream a shattering whisper of pain, my doubts are confirmed when noone hears a sound, So I choose not to go, but to stay, insane, allowing the truncated trith to leave me where I was found, And I hate my damnation but it is all I have, Even the grand price I pay , at least gives me some feeling of something profound.  Here I die and am reborn into change, I reinvent the misery that noone sees and still you all look on with question marks, My picture in the dictionary, under the word strange, yet I wouldn’t produce light if I shit out sparks, And I long still to be loved,,,,,why? So I can be the dog with scurvey and mange , at the pound as you all pass me by ignoring my horrible barks.  Here I sit and write this tripe, feeling sad and lonely enough to cry to myself but I don’t want to hear it anymore, So Its either go hit the pipe, or sit and blubber like an infant until I wish to ball no more, And I choose one or the other but either will be the wrong one, Numb as I type, when I used to feel relief when I wrote, instead of getting more in touch with the rot at my core.

      I AM NOT A DRONE, I WILL NOT SUBMIT, I HAVE A WILL OF MY OWN, I DON’T CARE IF YOU DON’T SEE IT, AND I KNOW WHEN IM RIGHT, CAUSE IN THIS WORLD IVE GROWN,BIT BY BIT.  THIS IS NOT THE AVERAGE SITUATION, ALTHOUGH YOU’VE CONFUSED IT LIKE IT’S SO, THROUGH CONSTANT MANIPULATION, AND THE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW, THEY ALL THINK THEY KNOW WHATS UP, BUT THEY ALL SUFFER FROM RETARDATION,THIS YOU SURELY KNOW.   THANKS FOR MAKING ME HATE YOUR GUTS, I APPRECIATE THE MIRE, THIS TIME THOUGH YOULL CONVINCE NOONE THAT IM NUTS, THE GOAL TO WHICH I KNOW YOU ASPIRE, SOMEDAY ITLL BE JUST YOU AND I, WITH NOONE TO SAVE YOU FROM THE TRUTH THAT CUTS, HAVE TRUTH WILL TELL IT, HONESTY FOR HIRE.    I HAVE AN ISSUE AND ITS NAME IS YOU,LIKE A CANCEROUS TUMOR IN MY HEART, ID LIKE TO THINK A TREATMENT OF TRUTH WOULD DO,BUT YOUR  MALIGNANT LIES STILL TEAR ME APART, WAKE UP CAUSE IM ABOUT TO PUT YOU TO SLEEP, I CAN SEE A TIDBIT OF REALITY SHINING THRU,BUT IT COULD JUST BE ANOTHER FALSE START.

      Let me grow like a flower with you, together well reach the sky, Let me show you all that we can do, forever past the day we die, Because our love is eternal, And I know I love you through and through, even though I don’t always know why.   Let me run with you through the fields of grain, I know youll win the race, Let me take away all your pain, wip[e the tears from your face, Too little time to cry, Our we in love or just insane?, this a curse or gods own grace.  Let me lie with you under the sun all day,so we can soak it up and remember, Let me join you in the schoolyard and play, everyday until our vacation in December, Cherish every moment, Goodbye is what I never want to say, you I will always remember.   Let me run my fingers through you r hair, like silk on my skin so sweet, Let me show you how much I care, my raging body’s heat, Because I cant let you say no again, Without you my life is rotten dispair, nothing but loss and defeat,    Let me kiss you on the check, ill never ask for more, Let me walk you home everyday of the week and say goodbye when we reach your door, Ive got nothing better to do, These words I do not vainly speak, they come only from my very core.   Let me love you like noone else has ever in the past, I swear youll love me back, Let me show you what it takes to make this last, all weve got to do is keep it  on track, Because you and I were meant to be, So slow it down because we don’t need to go fast,the present aint so black.  Let me write you sonnets and pick flowers for you in the shade, well be together foreve and never doubt , Let me show you the future where weve got it made, when well never again go without, Because together we can do anything, I know our love will never fade, this from the highest mountain id surely shout.

      I HATE THIS WORLD, WHERE THER E SEEMS TO NEVER BE ANYTHING FOR ME, I HATE THIS WORLD, WHERE THERE IS ONLY EVER THE PROMISE THAT I WILL SOMEDAY BE FREE, I HATE IT AND IT HATES ME, I LOVE ONLY ONE THING:THE DREAM THAT DEATH WILL SOMEDAY BE THE END OF MY MISERY.   I LOATHE THIS PLACE, WHERE I WILL NEVER BE ALLOWED TO REST, I LOATHE THIS RACE, IN WHICH IT IS NEVER GOOD ENOUGH, BUT IS ALWAYS MT BEST, I LOATHE IT AND IT LOATHES ME, I CARE FOR ONLY A SINGLE WISH THAT I WILL SOMEHOW NO LONGER BE OPRESSED.  I CURSE THIS WRETHCHEDNESS, THIS MEANINGLESS FUNHOUSE FULL OF MIRRORS THAT SHOW ONLY WHAT OTHERS SEE, I CURSE THE FATHER WHO GAVE ME  LIFE AND THE MOTHER WHO CHOSE NOT TO ABORT ME, I CURSE AT LIFE AND IT CURSES RIGHT BACK, I AM, BLESSED ONLY BY THE FACT THAT THE END WILL SOMEDAY COME, INEVITABLY.

      THERE IS NO BEGINNING, NOR IS THERE AN END, THE SPINNING IS THE ONLY THING ON WHICH WE CAN DEPEND, SO ROUND & ROUND WE GO, ITS NO WONDER WE ARE GRINNING WHILE WERE SINNING, MISERY IS OUR ONLY FRIEND.  THERE IS NO TIME, NOR IS THERE A PLACE, NO REASON NO RHYME, NO PRIDE OR DISGRACE, WHY DO YOU THINK WE LOVE WHAT KILLS US QUICK? HAVE NO DOUBT WERE PRIME TO DO OUR TIME,MAYBE OUR FACE BUT NEVER OUR NAME WILL YOU THOUROUGHLY ERASE.  THERE IS NO SILENCE ONLY WORDS, NOR IS THERE ANYONE THAT EVER LISTENS , LIKE THE INCESSANT YATTERING OF A MILLION FUCKING BIRDS,ON A MILLION TWEEKER MISSIONS, WHAT IS THIS QUIET THING WE CRAVE? LIKE LEMMINGS WE FLOCK TO OUR DEATH  IN HEARDS, AS THE SUNLIGHT ON OUR BACKS GLISTENS.  THERE IS NO ME OR YOU , NOR IS THERE ANYTHING OTHER THAN OUR RAW DESIRE, ONLY THE PASSION FOR WHAT WE LOVE TO DO,STANDING ATOP OUR GROWING EMPIRE, IS IT ME OR IS THIS WORLD COWERING BENEATH? I LOOKK AT YOU AND WE BOTH KNOW THAT ITS TRUE, AS WE SET THE WORLD AFIRE.

      I think ill go lay down, In some seedy motel room downtown, The kind where congress men go to murder underage whores, lay down in the bathtub, and drown.  I think ill go off someplace and die, Curl up underneath the box springs and put a bullet between my eyes, The type of place where gunshots are commonplace, One less tear for me to cry.  I think ill go take a nap,  In a motel room that stinks of mildew and crap, The place where your scared to be alive anyhow, Where theres always the same me, staring on under my baseball cap.  I think ill go lay in the cool darkness of some dank, dirty inn, Listen to the static on the tv that wont come in, A wayward home for those who seek the last house on the block, Have microwave gas station burritos for dinner again.  I think ill go stay at the most nigger infested rat trap that I can find, Maybe one will kick down the weak little door and rob me blind, A dark, scary, lonely place that resembles nothing of a home, I think ill go lay down and die, because I cant rewind.   I think ill go get a room at the Manchester motel, Because I know if the niggers don’t get me ill die from the smell. The place where you look in the mirror for the last time and welcome the reapers touch, I think ill just go give up, because im tired of living this hell.   G-          2004

      SOMETIMES I SIT ALONE, WITH MY HEADPHONES ON, IN THE DARK I LOOK AT THE PHONE AND WONDER WHERE ALL MY FRIENDS HAVE GONE, I GET HIGH ALL BY MYSELF, INTO THE GREAT UNKNOWN, THE ABYSS FROM WHICH THIS NOTHINGNESS DID SPAWN.  SOMETIMES WHEN I SHOULD B HIGHER THAN HIGH, WHEN I SHOULD BE IN EUPHORIC BLISS, ALL I DO IS FUCKING CRY AND CRY, AND THINK OF THE LOVE THAT I MISS, I CRY ALL BY ,MYSELF, AND ASK THE GREAT NON LISTENER WHY  OH WHY,,WHY CANT I HAVE JUST ONE MORE KISS?  SOMETIMES IM LUCKY ENOUGH TO DULL OUT THE PAIN, BUT IT USUALLY BLEEDS THROUGH, I WISH I WOULD JUST HURRY UP AND FULL ON GO INSANE, BUT THEN WHAT WOULD I DO?, I DIE ALL BY MYSELF, AS THE EMPTY TAPS OF HOLLOW RAIN, FALL ON THE MEMORIES OF ME AND YOU.
