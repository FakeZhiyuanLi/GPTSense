      I was gone all day yesterday to go to a friend's birthday party. He decided to hold it at the Tokyo Diner. It was awesome! We decided to go with Hibachi (where they cook the food right in front of you). I jumped back when the chef made this huge wall of fire come up. ^_^; Then he did this thing that he called "Mt. Fuji" where he made an onion look like a little volcano. There was fire shooting up from it and everything. It was really funny when he tossed shrimp into our mouths because everybody missed. I also tried Miso soup (I think it was Miso soup...I'm not too sure what it was) and I liked it. The sushi (we got California rolls) was good.  We played DDR the rest of the time (with a little Armored Core at the end). I also got a Spongebob necklace from my friends! ^_^  Then I played some more FF7 at home. I got to the scene where *SPOILER FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE NEVER PLAYED THIS* Aeris dies...it was so sad that I cried! I think the music was what made me cry the most. I still like Sephiroth, though. Speaking of Sephiroth, I finally beat him in Kingdom Hearts! He was tough, but I did it! ^_^

      Today I found an interesting page posted by somebody...   urlLink Little by little, we're losing our privacy...   This is insane! They've gone too far this time. They have no right to start spying on us and violating our privacy. What exactly are they trying to accomplish?

      I beat Kingdom Hearts! The ending was great. I liked mini-scenes in the credits, especially the one with Cloud and Aeris. ^_^  Now I'm working on beating extra bosses and leveling up to battle Sephiroth...

      I added a link section to the blog.  TMP Forums is a forum that I go to. It's just awesome! You can talk to members in a thread called the Bar&Grill that takes place on the weekends, the mods are great, and you can buy anime at the  urlLink store .  GameFAQs is a site where you can get a bunch of walkthroughs, cheats, and hints for just about any game!  Flashplayer.com is also awesome. It's filled with all kinds of flash movies. Some of them are just hilarious! I really recommend looking at stuff by  urlLink LegendaryFrog  and  urlLink Waterman . The Waterman link I gave you is the funniest, IMO.  And, if you're bored, visit the  urlLink Snoop Dog Shizzolator . Enter in a site and shizzolate it!

      I've been spending a lot of time playing Kingdom Hearts. I'm fighting Riku in Hallow Bastion...it's the fight right after you defeat Malificent as a dragon. He's really hard and his voice is annoying! -_-;  Also, I ordered Final Fantasy VII! The reviews say that it's one of the greatest games ever made...I can't wait to play it!

      I pretty much played Harvest Moon: Back to Nature and Dance Dance Revolution all day. I also ate some Ben & Jerry's Cherry Garcia ice cream. ^.^   I also watched some Star Trek earlier today. I thought it would be stupid, but I actually liked it. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I'm watching  Psycho  right now. I can't really tell if it's good or bad because it's not over yet (and I missed the first 20 minutes of it).

      I'm back from my friend's house. We went to this youth group thing while I was there, too. It was...interesting to say the least. There was free food, so that was good. We had 'mountain pies' (which is just a fancy name for grilled sandwiches), played games, and had to sing songs I've never even heard of.  We also had smores! I liked that a lot. Too bad they're so messy...I hate it when the graham crackers break apart when you take a bite out of it and marshmallow gets all over your face...

      Hey, I guess this is my first blog. I should start by telling you a little about myself...  My name's Nina. My favorite colors tend to switch from time to time, but for the moment they're black and purple. I like anime, gaming, and Dance Dance Revolution. My favorite anime is Excel Saga and my favorite manga is Angel Sanctuary.  I would write more, but it's early, I'm hungry, and I have to go somewhere with a friend.

      We got a new puppy! She's a beagle and just plain cuuute! ^.^ We named her Lucy. She's so sweet and makes cute sounds when she sleeps. She also has this cute little growl and tries to look tough when she attacks our other dog, Ozzy. (Playfully, of course.)

      Gah...sorry I haven't added anything to the Blog in so long. I was really busy with a lot of things...  The Japanese Hair Straightener being the first one. In the beginning, I had to take a shower and wash my hair with a special shampoo. Then, I had to have this horrible smelling stuff put in my hair. It was the medicine that straightens the hair. I had to wait for about 30 minutes before I did anything else. Thankfully, I had some manga to read.  After that, my hair was rinsed for 10 minutes. Then I had to have it ironed so it would be straight. Then some kind of nice smelling thing was put in my hair to stop the medicine. After that, my hair was rinsed again and blow dried. It took three hours to do this, but it was worth it. Also, I can't bend my hair or anything and I can't put it behind my ears. Thankfully that's only for the first day...My hair used to be frizzy, somewhat curly, and thick, but now it's very smooth, straight, and thinner. It looks good!  Also, I was reading some more about FF7: Advent Children. Yuffie is going to be in it! But I wonder who the Wheelchair Man is? Everyone is trying to figure it out. I bet SquareEnix is sitting is laughing at us.
