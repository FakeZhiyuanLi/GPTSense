						   March 15, 2004  "Beware the Ides of...March?"  This is the first installment in the Vinterus blog.  Our site is about wine quality and why bad wine happens to good people.  Over the coming months (and years), I will outline for you:  what is a flaw; a fault; what are these flaws and faults about; how did that stuff get in my wine; and what (if anything) can be done about this.  Although Cesear was warned about the Ides of March, my research indicates that we are safe launching on "the Ides" of March.  (an ide is actually just a calendar manipulation and is not a holiday and many months have ides.)  Again, once we know the facts, things like wine become less scary.  Please come back often, as my goal is to make this a weekly update.  As such, the first edition will be uploaded on March 17th.

						    Foxy Lady...   Okay, so this post has nothing to do with women, can't blame me for trying.  Actually this is the second part to the dribbles of information that I gave you in the last post about my trip to Niagara-on-the-Lake, and also some other winery visits on the U.S. side.  As noted, I am not a wine critic so I will not rate wines here... this is a technical service to help those wine geeks who want to know just a little more wine chemistry.  So with that said, on the U.S. side I decided to taste some NY and PA wines, specifically not vitis vinifera (traditional European grapes like Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon).  Rather I decided to test the vitis labrusca or the American native varietals and their hybrids.  The reason was actually purely technical.  As noted in the post on lady bug taint, I have been searching for differences between v vinifera and v labrusca with regard to tainting by a whole range of pests and mites.  Additionally I wanted to investigate "chemically speaking", the term "foxy" with respect to wine character.  In wine jargon, foxy is defined as the odors and tastes of wines made from many of the American species of grape (i.e. vitis labrusca). A flavor substance called methyl anthranilate is partially responsible for this characteristic. A foxy wine smells and tastes like Concord grape juice.  I have heard this term used but didn't know how its effect on my palette.  The methyl anthranilate comes from grape skins, and therefore is much more perceptible in red wines (which the skins are left in contact with the juice) than in white (which they do not).  The most foxy of all the wines that I tried are ones you would have heard of if you have ever visited a PA or NY winery; Niagara, Catawba, Concord, Delaware etc.  The Niagara is a white wine and had a distinct foxy characteristic, as did all on the list.  The hybrids of v vinifera and v labrusca, tend not to have as much of that foxy flavor, but still a bit, for instance sevyal blanc is hybrid and many of the sevyal were very foxy (to me).  Incidentally, a very popular hybrid that is catching on here in the US and Europe is Vignoles.  Done well, it is grapey without the foxy characteristic.  Winemakers do have to pay attention to this grape closely and make sure that the sugar does not get too high (or you get Welch's Grape Juice).   Research shows that as the grape comes closure to ripening,the concentration of methyl anthranilate increases dramatically.  Therefore it logically that if the grapes are overly ripe or have had a late summer burst of warm sunshine, the higher the methyl anthranilate and thus the more foxy the wine.  Combating this is difficult, as normally the Niagaras and Catawbas are meant to be sweet wines, and thus the winemaker is pushing for a high sugar content prior to crush.  We actually testing Wine Rescue on methyl anthranilate, as the chemical is relatively adsorbable and we felt that it may be a method to "clean up" bad vintages in the winery.  The analytical is not yet back, but to the taste it definitely removed much of the foxiness of the wine.  The the case of a $6 Catawba from PA, it turned the wine into a much more even and pleasurable summer experience.  While the science of foxiness is a bit on the boring side, it is important to note that many of the up and coming hybrids can have the foxy tones, and the winemaker must be alert.   Next time we go Malolactic!  Cheers

						    The Periodic Table of Wine Fault Chemistry   I was looking for a way to communicate the major types of wine faults to the public, that could be used by both the wine geeks and the general public.  I came upon the idea of creating the Period Table of Wine Fault Chemistry, which is available for free download at this link:   http://www.vinterus.com/pdffiles/winefaults.pdf   [Note that we do have a full size poster that will be mailed when you register at our winerescue.com]  The idea was simple, but the execution was torture.  Luckily we had help from Sewickley Graphics on the artwork and layout... but the hard part was the technical stuff.  Obviously, we needed to lay out the major categories of wine faults and then create a drawing that aids the consumer in knowing how they would identify that fault.  For example we have a drawing of a stinking bulb of garlic for ethyl mercaptan contamination.  Ethyl mercaptan winds up in your wine due to poor or incomplete fermentation.  My personal experience with it is that it shows up when the winemaker is either hurrying a ferment or does not have the patience to work through a stuck fermentation.  I have about two cases of zinfandel made by a well known consulting enologist in Amador County that is loaded with ethyl mercaptan.  The garlicly almost cabage-like odor robs this normally highly rated wine of its normal flavors and aromas.  It is truly a flaw, as I cannot drink the stuff without Wine Rescue [shameless product plug #1].  It got much more difficult as I worked through the more subtle flaws and faults.  One of those is diacetyl (2,3 butandiene).  While this sounds like Chemistry 101, it is something that all of you chardonnay drinkers know all too well.  Diacetyl gives white wines the buttery flavor.  Many people enjoy this and like their chards as buttery as possible.  Therefore, calling this a flaw/fault was a bit of heresy for some.  I felt justified keeping it on the list as too often critics give too high of points for things like the butteriness or oak flavor, when the true grape character is either muted or hidden completely.  I promised to give some notes from a trip to Niagara on the Lake (pure business).  I did have the opportunity to taste some tank aged chardonnays from several major wineries in Ontario.  Since we are not here to plug wineries or to give wine scores, I am not going to pass out the links.  Also, we do keep strict confidentiality with our clients.  The point here (yes I was getting to a point) is that these tank fermented chardonnays were alive and jumping, and did not get taken over by either the oak or diacetyl.  Wine tasting is subjective, and we all like different things.  So when I call diacetyl (too much of it) a flaw or fault, that may not be seen as true by many chardonnay devotees (of which I am not).  The concept though of providing this periodic table is much simpler than that:   our mission is to educate the wine drinking public and provide them with tools to both enjoy and when necessary rescue their wine.  [shameless product plug #2].  Next week we will journey into a concept known as "foxy" wine!    Peace

						   The Alchemy of Fermentation  First the definition of alchemy which is useful here:  Alchemy (AL KEM E); The medieval and Renaissance precursor to modern chemistry, characterized by mystical philosophy and attempts to turn "base" metals such as lead and tin into "noble" metals such as gold and silver. The tenets of alchemy were based on the theory of the four elements (see elements, the four), in which all matter was composed of varying proportions of four substances--air, earth, water, and fire. Chaucer's "Canon Yeoman's Tale" focuses on the deceptions of false alchemical practitioners, and Shakespeare's The Tempest borrows heavily from alchemical lore in its depiction of the island's magical spirits.   The only difference between turning lead into gold and grape into wine is that the later CAN BE DONE.  It is of mystical proportions to many of us, skilled in the art, that this biochemical function occurs so normally and makes such a lovely end product.    Alas the science of fermentation the chemist share with the biologists, unfortunately as this would be a great feat to call our own.  Since the yeast is doing the heavy lifting and it is technically alive (if you call laying in a pool of grape juice living) we have to say the the yeast is responsible.    Fermentation is a rather simple process once you think about it:  the simple conversion of sugar to alcohol.  A more technical treatise is outlined below, only because I promised you that I would give you some of the "inside scoop" on this blog.  During the primary fermentation of wine, the two grape sugars, glucose and fructose are converted to alcohol (ethanol) by the action of yeast. The by-products of primary fermentation are aromas and flavors, the gas carbon dioxide, and heat. The production of heat during fermentation (i.e. it is an exothermic process) means that during fermentation the temperature of the fermentation vessel will rise, and will require action on the part of the winemaker to cool it down. White wine fermentation is usually conducted in the range of 46-66F, and red wine fermentions typically are allowed to run at between 72 and 90F. At temperatures higher than this, there can be a loss of desirable aroma and flavour compounds, and unattractive aroma characters in the spectrum of caramel, burnt or cooked characters can be produced. There are many types of yeast, but two closely related types known as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces bayanus are the ones that are responsible for fermentation.   These species of yeast are encouraged to conduct the fermentation because they:   Are alcohol tolerant. That is, they can continue to ferment sugars to alcohol even during the latter stages of fermentation when the sugar is low but the alcohol content is high.   Can establish a viable population in an environment of high sugar (190-270 grams per litre) and high acidity.   Are strong and consistent fermenters even at cold temperatures.   They ferment quickly and only stop when all the grape sugars have been utilised. Otherwise we would be buying sweet low alcohol wines.   Are more tolerant to sulfur dioxide than other yeasts and bacteria.  Since our friends at the aramo wheel were kind enough to allow us to pilfer some of this prose, I would suggest checking out there products, both the aroma wheel and the wine aroma dictionary, and long-lasting pack of scratch and sniff cards to aid in teaching the novice and expert alike in certain aroma characteristics in wine. You can find them at www.aromadictionary.com  In white winemaking the juice is usually inoculated with yeast following its clarification. The most common type of inoculation is that using an active dried yeast culture. Yeasts are freeze dried and stored in vacuum packed tins by yeast supply companies ready for use. The winemaker then re-hydrates the yeast in warm water bringing them out of their state of suspended animation. The hydrated yeast is then added to the juice.  Another less interventionist approach is to let nature take its course. The grapes have a bloom that contains active cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. After juicing the grapes these grape yeast cells and other yeast cells picked up from the winery equipment then start to convert the grape sugars to alcohol. This type of fermentation is variously called natural, indigenous or spontaneous fermentation.  The former approach is common in New World winemaking while the latter is more often practiced in Europe. So what are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach to inoculation?   The advantages of winemaker inoculation are:    Choice. Many different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been isolated and have different properties. Some produce very fruity (estery) aromas, others produce more neutral characters. Some ferment better at colder temperatures than others.    Consistency. All strains are selected for their ability to meet the general necessary criteria given above. This maximises the chances of clean and complete fermentations occurring.    The advantages of spontaneous inoculation are:    Better Mouthfeel. Many commentators' report that they feel that spontaneous fermentation promotes better mouthfeel in wines. That is, the wines are thought to be softer and creamier than those made using single strain starter cultures. This suggestion however has not been conclusively demonstrated scientifically. The rational for the suggestion is that the natural yeast flora on the grape is genetically heterogeneous, i.e. consists of multiple strains and that this is the reason for the improved mouthfeel.   Cost. Spontaneous fermentation costs nothing to initiate.    The disadvantages of spontaneous fermentation are:    Lag time. Yeast cells increase in number by division. One becomes two, two become four, four become eight etc. The initial numbers of yeast cells in an un-inoculated juice are by nature low. Dividing from a low initial base of cells means that it takes longer for fermentation to become active. A wait of 3-4 days is typical. In large commercial wineries where the vintage is planned to work like clockwork, with tanks becoming free just when purchased fruit is to arrive at the weighbridge, the uncertainties of spontaneous fermentation present excessive risk. When inoculating, the winemaker adds about 5 billion cells per litre. Quite a head start over spontaneous fermentation.   Higher probability of spoilage. In theory this should be a problem but in practice it rarely is. Sometimes other spoilage yeasts and bacteria take advantage of the ecological void caused by the shortage of active yeast cells in the early stages of spontaneous ferments. In practice this can be avoided by ensuring that the acidity of the juice is sufficiently high. Saccharamyces cerevisiae is more tolerant to acidity and sulfur dioxide than most other organisms, and winemakers use these facts and engineer the juice environment to favour its growth over the undesirable microbes.   The white juice may either be entirely fermented in barrel, or in tank, and when partially completed, transferred to barrel. With red wines, practicalities demand that they be fermented in tank for most of duration of the ferment (so as to ensure appropriate extraction of colour and tannin from the skins), before the coloured partly fermented juice is drained into barrel to complete the fermentation. Temperature control in barrel ferments is pretty basic. The barrels are placed in a cool room and the wine is left to ferment. The smaller volume and relatively high surface area of the barrel aids in temperature control. Barrel fermentation is generally carried out for premium full bodied styles and used with varieties such as Chardonnay, Semillon and occasionally Sauvignon Blanc. Any full bodied red wine can benefit from partial barrel fermentation.  White wines are often left in contact with the dead yeast cells (lees) that fall to the bottom of the barrel following the completion of fermentation. This contact is usually for a period of six to nine months, and the lees can either be left or stirred (battonage) at regular intervals. Barrel fermentation and lees contact increases the aroma and flavour complexity, imparting smokey, toasty and cheesy flavors to white wines. Some winemakers also feel that barrel ferment results in better integration of fruit and oak, and that imparts a creamy texture to the mouth-feel. However if it is overdone, the wine can take on overt doughy and vegetal characters.  Fermentation is completed when all the fermentable sugars have been converted to alcohol. This end point is measured chemically. Once the wine is deemed free of fermentable sugar, i.e. dry it is cooled to 40F and the dead yeast cells (known as gross lees) are allowed to settle. The relatively clear wine is then racked to remove the gross lees before it it is stabilised and filtered ready for barrel aging or bottling.  There you have it, the nitty gritty on fermentation science as we see it.  Next, we will be engaging in a bit of an off-site mission to to discover the secrets of Ice Wine...  hint, it involves international travel...

						    Lady Bugs, MOG, and Life   A little known defect to those outside of the Eastern U.S. winemaking regions is a little problem know as Ladybug Taint... Good gried, another taint?  Sure is, and this one is even tougher to resolve than TCA.  As readers of this Blog know, Vinterus Technologies has resolved the TCA issue using a product known as Wine Rescue.  (scheduled to be release in 2004).    Ladybug taint is much worse in many ways.  The asian ladybugs arrived in North America in 2001, and brought with them solutions for soybean growers and massive headaches for winemakers.  The asian ladybugs were introduced to destroy "naturally" the tiny soybean aphids that were destroying soybean crops in US and Canada.  Once they eat all the aphids, they are still hungry so they go after the pests in the vineyards.  The problem here, is that they stay on the vines until harvest, and when ladybugs are frightened they secret an obnoxiously bitter liquid containing pyrazine.  Pyrazine has an odor/flavor all of its own, but many liken it to cooked spinach or rancid peanuts. (neither too appetizing).  It seems that starting in 2001 ladybugs and their secretions where harvested in Canada and US along with grapes, and caused an uproar with the growing Ontario wine region. Many top flight wines were rendered undrinkable due to this taint.  The problem with pyrazine though, is that it is a chemical very unlike TCA in that it cannot be removed either in the winery or using Wine Rescue.  The problem is that pyrazine is very water soluble, and thus not a good candidate for removal using Wine Rescue.    This brings us to the concept of MOG, which many of you may know or not know.  MOG refers to "Material Other than Grape" that comes along with the grape at harvest.  When these "other materials", including ladybugs and their secretions, are crushed and fermented along with the grape, anything can happen. Please note:  bugs normally don't taste good and they do...er poop!  Generally speaking, MOG is not a problem as concentrations are low and imperceptable in the wine. The real issue is when MOG is substantial, like the ladybug taint.  This goes to the theory of unintended consequences.  The greens among us would rather use biological systems rather than pesticides to control pests, include soybean aphids.  Thousands of cases of wine, destroyed due to this unintended consequence of introducing these ladybugs rather than use totally acceptably safe pesticides (approved by both US and Canadian Environmental Authorities).   While I don't want to fill my fine Riedel crystal with pesticide, I think that judicious use would be the prudent course.  The ladybug was the first of many pests introduced to control others, what's next?    Next time, the alchemy of fermentation!

						    NASCAR and Wine?    I guess that's what it smells like, burning rubber.  I thought the catchy headline, NASCAR and wine would catch a few of you and make you read this totally technical summary of sulfur and wine.  Not to be too geeky, here is my best effort to explain this phenomenon.    Volatile Sulfur Compounds in Wine   Volatile sulfur compounds can contribute to "reduced", "sulfide", "rotten egg" aromas in otherwise acceptable wines. These unpleasant aromas are almost always caused by sulfides or mercaptans. Sulfide formation in wine has been a persistent problem. The chemistry of sulfide formation is complex. There are many potential interactions with vineyard and winemaking practices. Corrective options are limited and current winemaking techniques often include risks for sulfide formation.     Compounds Found in Wine    Nearly 100 volatile sulfur containing compounds have been found in wine, although fewer than ten are normally found in wines with sulfur related aroma defects. Sensory thresholds for volatile sulfur compounds vary depending on the type of wine and interactions with other wine aromas.      Table 1: Reported Sensory Thresholds for Sulfur Compounds    compound              structure       sensory description range     (ppb)  hydrogen sulfide         H2S         rotten egg, sewage-like       0.9-1.5  ethyl mercaptan       CH3CH2SH       burnt match, sulfidy, earthy  1.1-1.8  methyl mercaptan       CH3SH        rotten cabbage, burnt rubber     1.5  diethy sulfide        CH3CH2SCH2CH3        rubbery                 0.9-1.3  dimethyl sulfide        CH3SCH3    cooked cabbage, asparagus        17-25  diethyl disulfide     CH3CH2SSCH2CH3 garlic, burnt rubber          3.6-4.3  dimethyl disulfide      CH3SSCH3     vegetal, cabbage              9.8-10.2  carbon disulfide          CS2         sweet, ethereal,                 5     Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S )  H2S production is a natural by-product of yeast metabolism. Yeasts form H2S by reduction of sulfates, sulfites and elemental sulfur during synthesis of amino acids. Problems arise when yeast H2S production exceeds its utilization in forming amino acids and excess H2S "leaks" into the wine. Additional H2S can be formed by the natural breakdown of sulfur containing amino acids.   H2S is the most frequent volatile sulfur compound found in fermenting wine. Large amounts of H2S may be produced during fermentation. Under normal conditions, much of this H2S is volatilized from the wine along with CO2. The residual H2S may pose a serious problem due to its low sensory threshold and its potential reactivity. Several other volatile sulfur compounds arise from chemical modification of H2S.     Mercaptans (R-SH )   Mercaptans (thiols) are commonly found in wines. Their "burnt match" and "rotten cabbage" aromas may be even more pungent and offensive than H2S. Although the mechanisms of mercaptan formation are not clear, mercaptans are probably formed during fermentation by reactions involving H2S or breakdown of sulfur containing amino acids. Fermenting samples received at ETS that contain H2S usually also contain mercaptans.   Methyl mercaptan is the most common sulfide problem in post-fermentation wines. Ethyl mercaptan is less commonly found above its sensory threshold. Under certain conditions, mercaptans may be oxidized to form mono and disulfides. While this may remove the objectionable sensory effects of mercaptans, the effect may be temporary (below).    Disulfides (RS-SR)    Disulfides are common in wine, but are usually found below sensory thresholds. They are typically formed after fermentation from oxidation of sulfide or mercaptan precursors. They are a serious concern due to their propensity to revert back to mercaptans. Because of the lower sensory threshold of mercaptans, this conversion is often accompanied by an increase in objectionable odors. Disulfides are not responsive to copper without pretreatment to break the disulfide bond.     Diethyl and Dimethyl Sulfide (H3C-S-CH3)    Diethyl sulfide is usually present in wine at levels below its sensory threshold.   Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is present in almost all wines and is probably a breakdown product of amino acids. The formation of DMS does not appear to be related to H2S production. At low levels (15 to 20 ppb in whites and 20 to 30 ppb in reds) DMS can contribute "roundness", "fruitiness", or "complexity". DMS concentrations increase with wine age and the "canned corn" or "truffle" sensory characteristics of DMS may develop during bottle aging. At higher levels (> 30 ppb for whites and > 50 ppb for reds) DMS may contribute vegetative, "cooked cabbage", or "sulfide" smells to wines. DMS does not respond to copper applications.    Carbon Disulfide (S=C=S)    Carbon disulfide concentrations vary widely in wines. Wines analyzed can range from less than 1 ppb to over 60 ppb. Generally, carbon disulfide is not considered to be a problem and may contribute positively to wine aroma. Very little is known about factors affecting carbon disulfide concentrations in wine or about the chemical mechanisms of its formation.     Causes of Sulfide Problems in Wine    elemental sulfur residues from vineyard spray programs  high turbidity  yeast strains  must nitrogen deficiencies  other nutritional deficiencies  high fermentation temperatures  fermentor size and shape  inadequate aeration during fermentation  gross lees contact and extended lees contact

						    Understanding Wine Allergies    I am often asked, 'Why does this wine give me a headache?'  I would have to characterize this thumping head routine as a fault with wine, but obviously not one the winemaker can do anything about.  You see, by US law, the wine must be treated with sulfites which is often the culprite.  But since this blog is about,the Science of Wine, we need to look a 'little' deeper.  So below, I have outlined a bried treatise on wine and alcohol allergies.     Alcohol is a natural product   Alcohol (ethanol) is a normal by-product of human and animal cell chemistry/metabolism. Cell processes result in normal physiological levels of 0.01 to 0.03 mg of alcohol/100 ml of blood. By contrast, a blood alcohol limit for driving of 0.05 per cent is equivalent to 50 mg of alcohol/100 ml of blood.   Alcohol is broken down in the liver  Alcohol (ethanol) is broken down by liver enzymes within minutes. Conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde requires the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase. Acetaldehyde is then transformed to acetic acid ("vinegar") by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase. If individuals can't break down alcohol easily, problems may occur if alcohol is consumed.   Flushing is not an allergic reaction   Some people will experience intense facial flushing after having even small amounts of alcohol. These symptoms are most common in those with an Asian background. Other side-effects of fluttering of the heart (palpitations, tachycardia), sensation of heat, headache, tummy discomfort or a drop in blood pressure (hypotension) are related to high blood acetaldehyde levels. Individuals with these problems appear to be partially deficient in aldehyde dehydrogenase, resulting in high levels of accumulated acetaldehyde.   Alcoholic beverages contain ethanol and other substances  The liver breaks down the alcohol (ethanol) we drink and converts it to a chemical called acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is then transformed to acetic acid ("vinegar"). Problems occur if alcohol cannot be broken down. As well as ethanol, alcoholic beverages contain a complex mixture of grape, yeast, hop, barley or wheat-derived substances, natural food chemicals (eg. salicylates), wood and fruit-derived substances (eg. Histamine, tyramine in chianti), added enzymes (like papain) and preservatives (like sulphites). Severe allergic reactions have been described in people with allergies to proteins within grapes, yeast, hops, barley and wheat. These patients are not sensitive to alcohol itself. Furthermore, "fining agents" (like egg protein, parvalbumin and seafood proteins) are sometimes used to remove fine particles. Whether these occur in sufficient amounts to trigger allergic reactions is unknown.   Asthma can be triggered by sulphites  Up to a third of people with asthma complain that wine will worsen their asthma, less often with beer or spirits. Beer, wine and champagne contain sulphites (additive 220-226), used as a preservative since Roman times. Some people, particularly those with unstable or poorly controlled asthma, may wheeze when they consume these drinks. In general, there is more preservative in white wine than red wine, and more in cask wine than bottled wine. The amount of metabisulphite also varies from brand to brand. Some "low sulphite" wines are available, although those with extreme sensitivity may not be able to tolerate them. This is because some grape growers will dust sulphur powder over grapes in the weeks leading up to harvest. Other sources of sulphites include vinegar, pickled onions, dried fruit, or when dusted onto crustaceans and some restaurant salads or fruit salads. Sometimes grapes are transported with bags of sulphites to keep them fresh. Even when people complain that wine triggers asthma, sulphites may not be the only explanation.    Asthma can also be due to enzyme deficiency  Patients with aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency accumulate high levels of acetaldehyde after consuming alcohol. Acetaldehyde has been blamed for asthmatic reactions to alcohol in up to half of Japanese asthma patients. Sometimes histamine within alcoholic beverages has been blamed for allergic reactions.   Histamine and other substances may also cause problems  Histamine can trigger sneezing, runny nose and sometimes wheeze, stomach upset and headache. There is more histamine in red than white wines, although the amounts will vary from wine to wine. Some small studies have shown that antihistamines can help reduce the severity of symptoms, but as the amount of wine challenge was equivalent to only one glass, probably won't prevent hangovers! Others substances within wine may also cause problems to some unlucky individuals, but these are not well defined.   Serious allergic reactions to beer or wine may occur  Anaphylaxis has been described in patients with severe allergic reactions to proteins within grapes, yeast, hops, barley and wheat. These patients are not sensitive to alcohol itself.   Anaphylaxis to alcohol is rare  Allergic reactions to alcohol itself are rare, but described in a few dozen published case reports. As little as 1 ml of pure alcohol (equivalent to 10ml of wine or a mouthful of beer) is enough to provoke severe rashes, difficulty breathing, stomach cramps or collapse, a condition known as anaphylaxis. Given that the body constantly produces small amounts of alcohol itself, the reason that such reactions occur is poorly understood. Allergy tests using alcohol are usually negative, but sometimes positive to breakdown products of ethanol such as acetaldehyde or acetic acid ("vinegar"). Provocation tests with alcohol are usually positive, but only sometimes when acetaldehyde or acetic acid are used. Finally, alcohol can sometimes act as a "co-factor", increasing the likelihood of anaphylaxis from other causes.   So what does this mean?  A reasonable summary would conclude that most allergies are caused by sulfites and histamines.  While some wines consumed in Europe have very low levels of sulfites, most US wines are maintained as relatively static levels and thus can cause problems in those with sulfite allergies.  I have friends with histamine allergies, one can take an antihistamine (Claritan D) before drinking wine and it seems to help.  The other, it does not seem to help...   Next installment, who's burning the rubber?  Peace

						    Something about the name... Cork taint    I talk to a number of people who seem to know a LOT about corked wines, yet they continue to force me to believe that cork taint is caused only by bad cork.  I may not have a cellar full of Bordeaux, but we have done enormous research into wine faults and cork taint, specifically.  It turns out that this is a tragic name for a number of reasons...  1.  Nobody can really prove bottle to bottle that cork is the problem.  Often wineries can trace large lots of contamination to contaminated cork (i.e. BV, etc).  But the fact that we do not have consistant failure rates with the same cork, seem to cause some scientific credibility issues.  2.  Wine enthusiasts simply have no clue what happens during fermentation.  Even smaller amounts of chlorine present in the must "could" result in the creation of low level anisoles in the wine.  Fermentation is not exact, as the enologist does not know every chemical being produced during fermentation.  While we have been told this is not possible by the wine intelligencia, it is hard for us to understand as we have found anisoles in wine barrels, tanks and even in non-wine drinks.  How is this possible if it is only "cork" related.  3.  Cork taint does not communicate the problem... which is the wine is contaminated.  Now that "corked" is in the vernacular, it will be with us FOREVER. That's okay, but is is best for all wine enthusiasts to understand that wine is a wonderful mixture of hundreds of chemicals... this symphony of chemicals normally create a wonderful experience.  The presence of TCA and other faults can and do ruin this symphony.  My two cents anyway...  Peace

						    So what is a Dead Wine?    Okay, this is a subject that comes up a few times a year, so now we are blogging it is time to address it again.&nbsp; This has to do with variability of bottles of the same wine and vintage.&nbsp; A perfect example is when you buy a case of your favorite wine and you open a bottle somewhere between the first and the last and realize that "this one doesn't taste like the rest".&nbsp;&nbsp; We call this a&nbsp; "dead wine", in that something is in there deadening the flavor (without giving it an overt odor/flavor).&nbsp;   The most common reason for a dead wine is the same as for cork taint... trichloroanisole (TCA).&nbsp; (you can read more about cork taint in our other posts on the blog).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the chemistry is not well known, what essentially happens is that just enough TCA exists in the wine to be at or below the normal human perception limit but enough to mask the flavor of the wine.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the bottle may not smell like a wet dog, it doesn't taste like anything or it is very flat.   Often TCA is the culprit, but often other compounds like tetracholoranisole is present, as this is mainly found in the cases of cellar contamination whereby gross chlorine contamination has ruined entire vintages.&nbsp; Also tribromoanisole is also responsible for some of this masking, as it is chemical very close to TCA, but at low levels can deaden the wine as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;   As I mentioned, the chemistry is little known of how one compound gets in front of another (with respect to taste), but research being done now both in Australia and the United States on tasting threshold of TCA will elucidate this when completed.&nbsp; I can report that I have found a number of dead wines over the last few months, not corked, but just enough to kill the nose and deaden the flavor.&nbsp; I had one at a restaurant and requested that the waiter take it back to give me a new one.&nbsp; The manager did so reluctantly, but had to concede that I was correct when the new bottle was big and fruity.&nbsp; (To my horror, the restaurant served it by the glass in the bar as a I later saw the bottle).   This tells us that we should not accept wines when they are not right and that we should be more open to discovering and understand the nuances of wine chemistry.&nbsp; As you know, you have a home here for answers to all of your wine chemistry issues.   Until next time... Cheers   &nbsp;

						    Everthing you Ever Wanted and Needed to Know about Sulfites and Wine    Preservatives are an important part of wine making, and the consuming public should not worry about sulfites in wine (under normal circumstances). Not only do they keep wine from developing infections, they also keep the wine from oxidizing. If you are concerned about the use of sulfites in wine read on!   Sulfite actually occurs naturally in small amounts during fermentation. Sulfites are your friend. Not only do they keep wine from developing infections like fiIm yeast, mould, and acetobacter (vinegar bacteria), they also keep the wine from oxidizing. Without the use of sulfites most wine would have to be consumed literally within months of production without it going to vinegar wor worse.  Many people worry that they may be allergic to sulfites. True sulfite allergies are very rare. It's more likely that they have been exposed to a high level of sulfites in the past. In the 1970's restaurants would douse their salad bars with 2000 PPM (part per million) sulfite solutions in order to keep the produce fresh. Mixing this with acidic foods, such as salad dressings or vinegar, would cause the salad to release clouds of sulfite gas, provoking unpleasant reactions.    What most people describe as a sulfite headache is a reaction to bio-amines. These are compounds formed in wines for various reasons, one of the commonest being malolactic fermentation in the presence of sugar. Some commercial wineries start malolactic inoculation before the end of alcohol fermentation, guaranteeing the formation of bio- amines. So the first thing to do is to attempt to find wines that have not undergone MLF, and then determine whether the headache occurs or not.  Although I do not have a comprehensive list of wines that don't undergo MLF, checking out the producers web site is a good idea (look under wine making notes).  Many inexpensive wines do not undergo MLF therefore some claim that "cheap" wines don't bother them.  Go figure!  Potassium Metabisulfite is a stable source of sulfite in winemaking. The use of sulfur compounds is not a recent innovation. The Dutch shipping companies popularized the use of sulfur in the 16th century by refusing to ship any wines not treated. They insisted on the use of sulfites because the treated wines were the only ones that survived a long sea voyage without spoiling.   Sulfites work by releasing free sulfur dioxide, which inhibits yeast, mould and bacteria. It does this in two ways: one, it kills some of the organisms outright, and two, it blocks the surviving organisms ability to reproduce.  Some wine makers claim to not add sulfites, which means that much more time has to be spent cleaning the equipment and ensuring that no stray yeasts, molds or bacteria are present.    Sulfites are also added directly to wine after fermentation, to help prevent oxidation. Oxidation in wine follows the same pattern that you see in the cut edge of an apple-the wine turns brown and takes on a flat 'cardboard' taste. Sulfur binds with the oxygen in the wine and prevents this damage.     Some facts that might clear up any misunderstanding about sulfites:     Sulfites are a recognized food additive. The federal government controls their use. .All commercially available wines contain sulfites, even those labeled 'Kosher' or 'Organic'.     Nearly all dried fruits and meats contain sulfites. Raisins, for instance, have up to 250 PPM. Frozen orange juice, bacon, dried noodles, all contain sulfite.     All grape-based wines produce sulfites naturally during fermentation, up to a level of about 1O PPM. Even with no addition of sulfites, wines will still contain them.    This is not to say that sulfites are totally benign. People with asthma or emphysema should avoid inhaling sulfite powder or the gas that comes off the prepared solution. It can act as a bronchial constrictor, aggravating any breathing problems. Also , adding extra sulfites to wine is of no benefit, as it can spoi I the flavor, giving it a 'burnt match', smell.    A final, but very interesting consideration is that if a wine maker insists not using sulfite additives, they must also leave out the sorbate. Sulfite suppresses malolactic bacteria, but sorbate does not. Without any sulfite to prevent malolactic fermentation, the bacteria will convert the sorbate into hexadienol, producing a stupendously horrible aroma of composting geraniums and rotting trout.  I know, it is more than you wanted to know and we are by no means M.D.'s here at Vinterus.  Any potential allergic reaction should be closely monitored with your physician.  As noted earlier, our consulting allergist tells us that most people who claim to have sulfite allergies do not test as such.  The simple test is the raisin test:  eat some raisons and if you get a headache, you have a sulfite allergy.    There are methods to eliminate sulfites are the point of consumption, a subject that I will take up in a later post.  Cheers!

						    GM Grapevines:  So what is all the fuss about?   (Thanks to WineBusiness Online, as major portions were swipped from Genetically Modified Vines and Yeasts Pit Science Against Emotion By Paul Franson in the December 1, 2003 Edition)  All editorializing is mine, facts are his!)             Genetic engineering has solved some of the most pervasive problems of our time, creating new drugs, chemicals, plastics and even aiding in "growing" living skin tissue for transplant patients.  The wine industry though, may never get the chance to see these advances come to their domaine.  Passionate opponents to the technique are using emotional appeals to tie the hands of wine researchers and producers.   Manipulating the genetic structure of grape vines might allow them to resist mildew and other fungi, fight Pierce's disease and better withstand cold, while improved yeasts could help produce more flavorful wine with lower alcohol levels. But opponents concerned by potential hazards of the process have already prompted some in the industry to end trials of modified vines and call for total bans–even on research.   Greenpeace, the nutjob flatearth society group (no apologies), conducted and publicized consumer and retailer research to discourage vendors from producing genetically modified (GM) wine, for example. They don't even want any research to occur.  Other opponents have adopted the catchy pejorative "Frankenwine" to frighten consumers.   The wimps at Moët & Chandon ended work on genetically engineered vines in 1999 due to concerns by both consumers and other winemakers, destroying the altered vines.  Unbelievably too, as M&C could reap vast benefits as they have seen their share of financial losses due to fungus and pests.  In 2002, a large group of well known Burgundian growers and producers for the second time denounced Genetic Modification of plants and micro-organisms in wine. Their report noted with regret that the Institut National des Appellations d'Origine (INAO) decision to forbid genetically-modified grape varieties and rootstocks for AOC vines and wines has been adopted without regard to the use of GMO micro-organisms (with yeast a concern in particular). The bottom line for the Burgundians, is, of course, terroir.  In California's Mendocino County, environmentalists were successful in passing an initiative that prohibits the propagation, cultivation, raising and growing of genetically modified organisms. Among those supporting the ban are a number of local wineries, including big Fetzer Vineyards, plus small producers in that environmentally conscious region.   With all the opposition, planting GM vines may be a moot point. The important European market has largely banned genetically modified food products and many European and other consumers won't buy GM foods.   As a result, many in the industry, whatever their views, are being very careful to reassure nervous consumers. The important Australian wine industry has issued a statement that no genetically modified vines are used to produce Australian wines, and promised not to use genetically modified vines unless they're proven safe and beneficial.   In fact, it appears that no genetically modified vines are used to produce any wine commercially at present.  The political and emotional opposition has left scientists frustrated. "The people most concerned don't have strong backgrounds in biology," noted famed grape geneticist Carole Meredith, who recently retired from the University of California at Davis. "They simply don't understand the issues."   A Host of  Potential Benefits The Potential of Wine Biotechnology   Professor I.S. Pretorius of the Institute for Wine Biotechnology in Stellenbosch University, South Africa is one of the leading voices in the world for genetic modification.  He is also one of the most respected speakers on the topic. Pretorius spoke at the 5th international symposium of the Institute of Masters of Wine 11th - 13th July 2002. His comments sparked lively, thoughtful discussion. No emotional rancor was generated; Pretorius is an intellect whose scientific work raises interesting, perhaps unanswerable questions.  Below, I have reprinted (with permission) the introduction to this thesis presented at the International Masters of Wine meeting in 2002.  "The shift of consumer preferences away from basic commodity wine to top quality wine, and the gruelling competition brought about by economic globalization call for a total revolution in the ‘magical' world of wine. In the process of transforming the wine industry from a production-driven industry to a market-orientated enterprise, there is increasing dependence on, amongst others, biotechnological innovation to launch the wine industry with a quantum leap across the formidable market challenges of the 21st century.  Market-orientated designer grape cultivars and wine yeast strains currently are being genetically programmed with surgical precision for the cost-competitive production of high quality grapes and wine with relatively minimal resource inputs and a low environmental impact. With regard to Grapevine Biotechnology, this entails the establishment of stress tolerant and disease resistant varieties of Vitis vinifera with increased productivity, efficiency, sustainability and environmental friendliness, specially regarding improved pest and disease control, water use efficiency and grape quality. With regard to Wine Yeast Biotechnology, the emphasis is on the development of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with improved fermentation, processing and biopreservation abilities, and capacities for an increase in the wholesomeness and sensory quality of wine. The successful commercialization of transgenic grape cultivars and wine yeasts depends on a number of scientific, technical, safety, ethical, lg Fal, economic and marketing factors, and it therefore will be unwise to entertain high expectations in the short term. However, in the light of the phenomenal potential advantages of tailor-made grape varieties and yeast strains, it would be equally self-destructive in the long term if this strategically important ‘life insurance policy' is not taken out by the wine industry.  This overview highlights the most important examples of the way in which Vitis vinifera grape varieties and Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine yeast strains currently are being designed with surgical precision on the basis of market demand for the cost-effective, sustainable and environmentally friendly production of healthy, top quality grapes and wine." wbm    Though wine scientists have discussed and are conducting trials aimed at producing better wines, Meredith downplays efforts to manipulate flavor. "It's interesting to consider, and people like to talk about it," she admited, but says the most pressing impetus for modifying vines is disease resistance.   A few years ago, when Pierce's disease seemed an imminent threat to California's wine business, there was much discussion about developing vines that would resist it. In 2001 a Florida scientist claims he did just that. Dennis Gray, a professor of developmental biology at the University of Florida's Mid-Florida Research and Education Center in Apopka, patented a method to insert genes in grapevines expected to make the plants resistant to Pierce's disease.   In the process, he implanted a gene from silkworms into grapevines.  "We believe these genes could protect grape plants against a number of diseases, but our target is Pierce's disease," he said in a news release. "We had promising results early on in the project, and we're optimistic tests will confirm heightened resistance in the plants."  His hope is to develop vinifera vines that could produce wines in Florida, but Pierce's disease is a much bigger issue in California. For now, it seems under control, and Gray admits things haven't progressed very far since his announcement. "We continue to make progress but the ‘bulletproof' grape plant we need for field testing is not yet in hand."   He adds, "We've had a drop in funding and some other obstacles to moving as fast as we could. Our research proposal to the Pierce's Disease Task Force, which is administered in California, was completely ignored last year, despite our research and demonstrated progress being at least seven years ahead of that in subsequently funded California programs."  Gray says that his major corporate partner, US Tobacco subsidiary Profigen, dropped its grape biotech program in 2001, firing most if not all of its grape-related in-house scientists, but continues to hold the licenses and have been unsuccessful in subsequent sub-licensing. This has been a serious obstacle to research progress because it has effectively blocked efforts to commercialize the technology through new corporate sponsors.     Mildew is the Big Target   Meredith, however, believes that the biggest potential of genetic engineering is to fight fungal disease. John Duarte of Duarte Vineyards agrees. "Mildew-resistance is the quality most in demand."  "In Europe and New York, for example, they have to spray extensively to fight downy mildew, which isn't a big problem in California." She says the strong Green movement in Germany makes growers especially sensitive to the spraying--but the Greens oppose genetic engineering, too.  In California, the biggest problem is powdery mildew which can be treated with relatively benign elemental sulfur, and grapes sprayed with sulfur are still considered organic.   Australia's Cooperative Research Centre for Viticulture (CRCV) is conducting research into powdery mildew, for example. Its scientists have identified a grapevine resistance gene and are working to isolate it. Once this is achieved, the gene could be inserted into vines to increase resistance to the mildew, saving growers the cost of spraying while also reducing the use of pesticides and the resulting residues.  Meredith also believes genetic engineering has great potential in treating fungal diseases inside vines, such as Eutypa, and some viral diseases.   She noted, however, that the most interesting potential is fighting those diseases themselves, not insect carriers like sharpshooters. "They infect the plant when they bore a hole to feed. It's too late to kill them after that."   Other insects, of course, infest and damage the vines. The vine mealybug is a big and growing problem in California. Duarte noted that controlling it takes persistent and undesirable orthophosphate pesticide.   "The vine mealy bug needed to be addressed in any way possible," he warned. He believes genetic engineering could be a solution, but it would take a lot of time and money, and it's a small market with many different vines to deal with. "These niche crops need public-private partnerships."  Meredith says that UC Davis, like other universities, is conducting research. She noted an interesting potential strategy for grapevines grown on rootstocks: develop rootstocks that could impart resistance to diseases without changing the scion. "Perhaps the rootstock could make something that interferes with harmful bacteria and send it up the vine's xylem. The wine grape vine wouldn't be genetically engineered. I can't see how that would be objectionable."   Improving Grape Characteristics   Though Meredith feels genetic engineering has the biggest potential in fighting diseases where, currently, either no treatment exists or where existing treatments are undesirable, there is also research conducted in improving the qualities of grapes.  In Australia, trials are underway at the Merbein Research Station in Victoria with up to 490 genetically modified vines to improve berry color and other characteristics. Among the 11 types of vines, four exhibit less fruit browning, three have altered pigmentation, one has altered fruit sugar composition and one has altered flower and fruit development. Two others contain fluorescent marker genes for monitoring pollen flow.  The vines are very carefully isolated, however, including netting to prevent birds or animals from spreading seeds, and the vine's clusters are bagged to prevent release into the wild.  The American Vineyard Foundation funds much research on vines in the US, and its director Patrick Gleeson says the organization is very supportive of better understanding the function of genes, and biotechnology is very helpful in doing so. "It's a powerful research tool, but must be used with caution."  He said the AVF is supporting biotech for research, but not product development. "We've got a good way to go before we fully understand the gene function," he noted.  The AVF sends a questionnaire to growers every few years, and asks whether they are supportive of using biotechnology to understand the gene function, and he said early reports from the latest survey showed 57 supporting, 46 opposed.  He also asked wineries if they would be interested in using biotechnology for winemaking, and 38 said yes, 65 no.  Interestingly, in the field, there was more support: 138 favored biotech, 46 didn't. He said, however, "The comments were all over the place."  Gleeson admits, however, that both Australia and Germany are ahead of the US in use of genetic engineering.   Some GM Trials   Greenpeace published a long paper on GM wine-grape vines that opposes their use, but does catalog many of the trials now taking place:  • Research on GM vines at Cornell University in New York includes work with Chardonnay, Merlot and other varieties modified to be resistant to powdery mildew and Botrytis cinerea.   • In Southern Ontario, Canada a wine producer in collaboration with researchers at the University of Guelph has developed vines with greater resistance to the cold (between 3-5 degrees Celsius). These vines were planted out in field trials in 1997.  • In Europe, field trials of GM grapes have taken place in Germany, France and Italy, but no GM vine or wine has yet received approval for marketing.   • A number of GM grapevine trials are being carried out in France by the government research organization INRA (National Institute for Agronomic Research) on a number of grape varieties which have been genetically modified to be resistant to grapevine fanleaf virus.   Trials of GM vines began at two locations in Germany: Rheinland-Pfalz and Bavaria in 1999, and are due to continue for 10 years. The grape varieties in the trials are Riesling, Seyval Blanc and Dornfelder. The vines have been modified to be resistant to mildews caused by Plasmopara viticola and Unicicula necator. The vines also contain an antibiotic resistance gene.  According to a Swiss publication, a wine has been produced by Regent, a German producer, using genetically modified grapes that contained a gene from barley that helps them resist attack by molds. This wine cannot be marketed without EU approval.  In Italy, research is being carried out on GM grapevines at the University of Ancona under a consent issued in 1999 (www.greenpeaceusa.org/media/publications/grapewinereport.pdf).   Trials are also taking place in Alsace and South Africa.   In addition, researchers at Dry Creek Laboratories in Stanislaus County inserted a gene from the snowdrop into grapevine rootstocks to protect against sap-sucking insects and nematodes. The Lab is partly owned by John Duarte of Duarte Nursery, but he says the laboratory is not working on transgenic grape vines, but is focusing its efforts on apples.   As an owner of one of the largest nurseries in the industry, however, Duarte follows the subject carefully. He says that there are no transgenic nursery vines available in the US. But he said there's a demand for a solution to problems that transgenic vines could address. "The public wants greater sustainability and transgenic vines can reduce pesticides."   Confusion Among Consumers   One issue, as Meredith noted, is lack of understanding about genetic engineering. "Scientists have been using genetic modification for a hundred years without recombinant DNA," she pointed out.  The biggest concern among many opponents is to putting parts of animals into plants. "They've heard these horror stories, and say, ‘I don't want to eat a tomato containing fish genes!'"   Technically, ‘transgenic' simply means adding something to the gene from any source, including a related plant such as wild grapes, a micro-organism or a synthetic splice. She says, however, that a lot of genetic engineering involves other plant genes.  In conventional breeding, for example, if you combined Syrah with Pinot Noir, you get a completely different plant. With genetic engineering, you get the same plant, but with some characteristics modified. "Put genetic material from a daffodil into rice, and the plant doesn't resemble a daffodil. It's still rice."  She added, "There are dangerous genes--but you can develop them with conventional breeding, too."  In fact, she acknowledges that genetic engineering can be misused, and she calls for it to be used carefully only by well-trained people who are carefully supervised. "It's just a tool, and like any tool, it can be misused."    From Vineyard to Cellar: GM Yeast    Of course, other products beside vines are used in wine production, and improved yeasts are even more likely to be available to winemakers since they are better understood and easier to modify than vines.   One interesting product that is now commercially available is malolactic yeast that performs both alcoholic and malolactic fermentations simultaneously, minimizing growth of lactic acid bacteria capable of producing allergens such as histamines. It was developed by Hennie van Vuuren, Chair Food Biotechnology and director of the British Columbia Wine Research Centre.  According to van Vuuren claims consumers sensitive to bio-amines are unlikely to get headaches when drinking wines produced with the ML01 yeast. He says the yeast has received the status Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) from the FDA.   The malolactic yeast also prevents sluggish and stuck malolactic fermentations with subsequent spoilage of wines.   Moreover, van Vuuren says the color of red wines produced with the malolactic yeast is much more intense compared to wines produced with bacterial malolactic fermentation. This is particularly useful for the production of Pinot Noir wines.   As noted by van Vuuren and colleagues other yeasts that have been created experimentally with interesting properties:  • Resistance to toxins that kill yeasts  • Can convert sugar to lactic acid  • Breaks down grape particles in must for greater color and juice and better precipitation of particulate matter  • Enhancing glycerol production for greater extract and mouth feel  • Cleaves glycosidic link of bouquet precursors for greater floral aromas  Linda Bisson, a professor at UC Davis, regards a special goal in warm climates creating yeast that converts sugar to alcohol less efficiently, likely by producing other beneficial compounds.   David Mills is an assistant professor of viticulture and enology at UC Davis, and he has been using genetic methods to study the malolactic process. He emphasizes, however, that he's not trying to make a better ML bacteria with genetic engineering. "The process is little known, and we want to learn more about it."  The Institute for Wine Biotechnology of the Stellenbosch University in South Africa has also produced a number of genetically modified yeasts.    Opposition   The opposition to genetically modified vines comes from the same sources as opposition to other genetically modified food plants. Interestingly, they're objectively stated in a report allowing GM vines to be tested in Australia:  "The main potential hazards to human health and safety and the environment which were considered related to whether;  the GM grapevines might be harmful to humans because they may be more toxic or allergenic than non-GM grapevines as a result of the novel gene products or because of unforseen or unintended effects;   the GM grapevines might be harmful to other organisms if they were to be more toxic or allergenic than non-GM grapevines as a result of the novel gene products or because of unforseen or unintended effects;   the GM grapevines might be harmful to the environment because of inherent weediness or increased potential for weediness; and  the genes introduced into the grapevines might transfer to non-GM grapevine crops, to related species, or to other organisms, with adverse consequences for the environment."  Office of Gene Technology Regulator, Executive Summary, "Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan for Application No. DIR 031/2002, Limited and controlled release of GM grapevines," (www.ogtr.gov.au).  After evaluation, however, the license was granted to plant the vines, though with strict safeguards.  These moves in Australia and elsewhere are being closely scrutinized in Burgundy. Consequently, several of the independent growers and negociants have formed Terre et Vin de Bourgogne. According to the group's mission statement, Terre et Vin de Bourgogne, "has been set up in order to help the diffusion of information, to watch and take a stand concerning viticulture and Burgundy wine making, faced with new technology, GMOs and [other questions]." The organization has called for a ten-year moratorium on "any GMO vine and wine marketing and total transparancy concerning research and approval procedures."  On a broader scale, serious questions remain in the minds of many people about genetic modification of living organisms and the possible consequences. Even minor processes involving inserting parts from one grapevine into another get tied up with ethical questions about cloning humans.   Perhaps time will resolved many of the questions.    A Clouded Future   In spite of the controversy, Meredith believes genetically engineered vines will be used after thorough testing. "The people who are concerned will gradually become more comfortable with the technology and the issue will go away," she predicted.  She admited that we aren't likely to see genetically engineered vines in traditional expensive wines. "Wine is a lot more than a beverage. The history and tradition is a part of it. People who cherish this tradition won't want engineered wines."  She believes the first commercial uses will be in lower-priced, high-volume wines where the economic benefits are most apparent. "The people who produce these wines are less interested in tradition than productivity," she said.   This means that the highest potential is in highly productive wine regions like California's Central Valley, the south of France, Chile and South America, places where large volumes of generally good wines are produced at low cost.   She feels that consumer attitudes will be an important factor in the US, but believes that there will be no market for genetically modified wines in Europe where sentiment is so strong.   Some European activists, in fact, are calling for a ban on food products from any country that allows modified plants or animals out of fear of accidental contamination, which has occurred with plants like canola and corn.   Some US producers suspect these actions are also hidden ways to limit imports from competitive New World countries.  Others in the wine business disagree and don't want genetic engineering to be used. Paul Dolan, until recently president of Fetzer Vineyards, is outspoken in his personal opposition to using genetically engineered vines. "I hope the world doesn't run down this path. There are so many other environmental issues we have to deal with that taking this approach to lowering costs and improving productivity doesn't make sense."  He believes strongly in trying to create wines that better express their terroir and this flies in the face of that goal.  At any rate, wine made from modified vines is many years away from commercial production. It's estimated that it will require at least 10 years of trials before any can be sold.

						    Glass shape affects wine's chemistry     Exclusive from New Scientist Print Edition.        Wine connoisseurs have always claimed that the shape of the glass matters because it affects how close your nose gets to the wine and also how easily volatile aromatic compounds can escape. But Kari Russell of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville wondered if the shape of the glass affects the wine's chemistry as well.  Russell measured the concentration of phenolic compounds in a Merlot as it sat in three different glasses: a flute glass, a Martini glass and a wide Bordeaux glass.   Phenols are ring-shaped compounds containing hydroxyl groups, and as antioxidants are thought to be responsible for some of the health benefits of moderate red wine consumption.  After pouring the wine, Russell found that the concentration of a phenolic compound called gallic acid increased, presumably because the action of pouring triggered reactions that converted gallic tannins in the wine into gallic acid.  But between 10 and 20 minutes later, the concentration of gallic acid in the flute and Martini glasses remained high, while the concentration in the Bordeaux glass fell.   Russell thinks this is because a higher surface area of the wine is exposed to air in a Bordeaux glass. Oxygen drives the formation of compounds called catechin-gallate esters from the gallic acid. When esters pass your lips, they precipitate the proteins in your saliva, making the wine taste dry.  Although Russell saw a similar chemical development for other phenolic compounds, the shape of the glass didn't make such a difference.  After decanting wine into an inelegant lab beaker to prevent psychological bias, she asked a panel, mostly of students, to taste wine that had sat in different glasses.   The majority did not notice any difference. But one panellist - an older professor - did seem to be able to tell. "I think with training the glass might make a difference," says Russell.

						    So what is MLF (Malolactic Fermentation) Anyway?   As wineries increase the amount of information on their labels and websites, often winedrinkers see that a wine has undergone malolactic fermentation to achieve its current flavor. What is this kind of fermentation, and what does it do to a wine?   Obviously, if you are reading this blog you know how wine is made: in essence, grapes are crushed, the juice is fermented and aged, and bottled. Fermentation is when yeast eats the sugar in the juice and turns it into carbon dioxide and alcohol. Between the fermentation and aging steps, sometimes another step is introduced. This is the malolactic fermentation, sometimes abbreviated to MLF.   What happens during this fermentation is that malic acid, which has a sharp flavor, is acted on by special bacteria. This usually takes place in a barrel set aside for this purpose. The result is that carbon dioxide is given off, and the malic acid is converted into lactic acid. This smooths the flavor of the wine. This was a key development in the past century, and by 1990 most red wines and many sparkling wines underwent malolactic fermentation.   Once a barrel has been used for malolactic fermentation, there are always bacteria in the barrel and from that point forward it must always be used for wines intended for this kind of extra fermentation. Often in a winery you will see barrels labelled "ML" or "MLF", and this is why.   Usually a wine that has undergone malolactic fermentation will be more complex and less acidic. It also can take on buttery and creamy overtones, as lactic acid is the type of acid found in milk.   Like politics, there are two distinct camps regarding MLF.  First is the flat earth society who believe that wine should be made exactly how it was made a century ago (no new technology... period!).  While MLF is not necessarily new, its acceptance is new.  Like many great ideas, it was discovered quite by accident by a microbiology graduate student nearly 50 years ago.  The secong group are the MLF groupies who think that they can taste malolactic acid (MLA) in nearly every wine.  At a recent tasting of Italian reds, no less than 5 of the attendees complained about MLA in the wine (only after being told that none of the wines had undergone MLF).    There is no way of knowing at the store when purchasing wine, but needless to say it adds some cost to the wine therefore it is doubtful that your Hardy box wine has undergone MLF.   I am pretty sure that this is quite enough information about MLF - but as I said, the question was asked I was compelled to answer.   Cheers!

						    What is cork and why do we use it (Part 1)?   We recently got an email question so simple, yet elegant that it spawned a chain reaction of research and blogging to both provide a decidely geeky and relevent answer. The question comes from Sarah Davis, Modesto, CA: "I am a chemistry student and have a simple question. What is cork (chemically) and why does the wine industry assume that it is neutral enough not to effect wine's flavor"  This is a great question and not much data exists for the average person on this subject. As you may or may not know, cork consists of a honeycomb of tiny impermeable cells made from suberin, a complex fatty acid that are filled with an air-like gas. There are on average about 40 million cells per cubic centimetre of cork or around 800 million cells in a single wine cork.The suberin base is thought to be fairly inert (I would use that term rather than neutral), although they are made up of long chain polyphenolics and polyaliphatics (aromatic hydrocarbons and straight chain hydrocarbons) that "could" theoretically oxidize and deposit in wine. The compound thought to be the base structure polyphenolic is hydroxycinnamic acid which is considered totally inert because it has been polyesterized and would not be likely implicated in leaching phenolics into wine.  Suberin is another subject completely, as huge body of data exists regarding suberin chemistry and how it reacts with certain compounds. My favorite suberin reference is noted at the following site:  urlLink http://publish.uwo.ca/~bernards/temp/demystifying_suberin.pdf   The chemistry of the cork is such that the hydrocarbons are SO large and so chemically stable, that they are nearly unlikely to react with compounds found in wine (water, ethanol, glycerol etc). That is not really a good answer (technically), but I will attempt to answer with as little "chemistry geek" language as possible. Essentially, the cork is bark from a cork oak tree. This means that the suberin is created by a living thing (a tree) and thus are there for a reason. Evolution biologist suggest that cork oaks evolved due to the climate differences in Portugal and Spain. It is assumed that through the centuries, high amounts of atmospheric humidity caused the cork oaks to evolve a method to "respirate" the moisture into the tree. (again, this is an educated guess since we don't have the master plan figured out yet).  So the cork bark after harvest is cleaned, dried, disinfected and finally manufactured into corks. The suberin material while not still alive, is extremely stable (chemically), to ward off oxidizing invaders from the atmosphere. These very large chain hydrocarbons or large aromatic hydrocarbons are very difficult (chemically) to oxidize or reduce. Since wine is chemically pretty tame, the wine sits on the cork and it is believed "breathes" ever slow slightly between the cork barrier and the outside world.  Next time, we will get into the history of using cork and why it is still in use today. Until next time, cheers!  PS - Remember - we are unbiased in the closure debate and the information provided herein is not intended to support or decry natural cork... just the facts maam.  Cheers
