      Every time I see that chessefest Drew Barrymore film  Never Been Kissed , I get all weepy during the end scene on the pitchers mound. What's worse is that I feel compelled to share this information with strangers over the Internet. So now you have something to hold over me if I ever lose my mind and join the NRA.  This evening I also took, of all things,  urlLink Jaleh's knitting quiz .

      To celebrate, I spent three hours watching movies on IU's free movie channel last night.  I finally feel in syncronicity with the rest of America, who was also home watching television; I could see the glow of all those flickering screens from out my window.  Today I clean the old place, empty out my car of moving debris, unpack, catch up on email, and apply for jobs.   I'm also taking a box of books that are good but that I don't want to carry up or down any more flights of stairs to the Library Science library. So if you want something new to read, stop by there this afternoon.  I was going to type up a list of them, but then I  realized that I am not quite that geeky.  There's some good stuff, though: Salman Rushdie, Sherman Alexie, Russell Banks, Kingsley Amis, Oscar Hijuelos'  Mambo Kings , which is a sexy, sexy book.  Steve Martin's  Shopgirl , and John Cheever's short but excellent  Oh What a Paradise it Seems .  I've either read these, or had hoped to but now have some other books to read instead.    Can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to one day having a stable place to live, where I don't have to give up so much of the stuff I've enjoyed over the years.

      Last night I packed up the last of the small items from the old apartment.  With most of my moving over with, I brought over some beer to the apartment of my soon-to-be ex-neighbor and fellow library geek, Sally.  She was with a new neighbor and fellow library geek, Mary, whom I unsuccessfully tried to remind myself throughout the evening was   born   the year I turned   fourteen  .  The injustice.  We all spent the next four hours drinking beer on the front step.  It was a nice way to say good-bye to the old place.  P.S.  My consolation for this confrontation with the broadening age gap between myself and the typical graduate school student is that apparently, to them, I look 26.  You can tell that I'm having age issues this week.  That, or I'm turning in to Michael Douglas.

      [inane post may be next to go... Stay tuned!]  ...Since 1990 is the last time I lived in campus housing, which is where all the partying was going on back then.  Funny how weird that seems when I stop and think about it.  I had a look at the new campus apartment this morning and I think I'll really enjoy living there.  In fact, I wish I had known how nice they were earlier on; I could have saved a few hundred dollars over the past school year in what I've been paying for an Internet connection and utilities.  Sadly, this boring news is all I have to write about.  Since I've done a good job moving stuff today, however, I can go enjoy another one of those movies.   Intolerable Cruelty , which I watched part of this morning, really is great fun.  Though I always confuse the title with that Drew Barrymore film,  urlLink  Irreconcilable Differences  .  I bet you do the same thing, don't you?  Sometimes I am exceedingly dull.

      Two things a person should not do: grocery shop when hungry, and go to the video rental store when avoiding packing.  However, I am pleased to have taken advantage of one of those previously viewed movie specials and can now enjoy  Mystic River ,  Cold Mountain , and  Intolerable Cruelty  as soon as I push the cardboard around enough to see over to the television.  Also, Oreo cookies are on special for, like, $1.99.    I loves movies almost as much as I loves making  urlLink goo-goo eyes  with sexy library girls.

      My four day weekend starts tomorrow, which is only the first part of a two week break from library school.  I'm very excited.  I have to pack and move, sure.  But I also get to read for fun, send out job apps, watch movies, sleep in, and go through my email inbox.  I get to plan meetings, get school stuff together for Fall, train for the new job, train the new person at the old job, work my twenty-five hours and invite folks over to housewarm the new digs.  I get to visit Jaleh in Hanover and see off my friend Stacey who is Portland-bound.  I get to go outside.  I have been treating this two week break like a junk drawer, thinking that if I just put stuff in there to worry about later, it would all eventually get taken care of.  Now we find out if that's gonna work.  At the very least I had a day this week when I didn't have to be on campus, and today has been cushy too: I spent it mostly pre-packing and playing the  bling bling .  Gloriane left for home this afternoon, and Stacey leaves tomorrow.  We went out for farewell beers the other night, but I don't think I've quite gotten it that they won't be around town anymore.  And it makes me feel strange to think that it's only just been a full year since any of us got here.  Feelings about my friends leaving are mixing with memories of arriving in Bloomington this time last year.  It will take some time to think about, but I'm both excited for our respective futures and sad to see this time together end.    You are never quite the same away from college as you are in it.  The people you meet seem somehow more part of you and the experiences seem more genuine.  Maybe because of how much stress you all collectively share, or maybe because you're in a place pursuing things that you want to pursue - it might just wake you up a little.  I spent a lot of time after college wondering why I wasn't making more of the types of connections I made then.  Now I'm back in it, and really, I think it's the mix of brainjuice and frantic optimism that draws people together, and keeps them in memory together for some time afterward.  Anyway, this is rambling.  But I hope it finds you well and at the very least, appreciating the transitions.  The weather is ridiculously perfect - caught between three seasons at once.  Everything around us is deciding what it wants to be and where it wants to go next.

      For the next 14 days, you can read this brief article from the  urlLink Salt Lake Tribune  regarding HBO's plans to make a series based on a polygamy-practicing family (one husband, three wives) in a very Utah Valley-like community.  The show is produced by Tom Hanks.  One problem is that my birth state will never be taken as anything more than an oddity. Knowing a woman acquainted with this type of set-up, however, I feel it's fair to say the roles women receive in these marriages are, you know, less than empowering.  The worst of it, I feel, is how predatory polygamy is toward women with low self-esteem, or with histories as recipients of sexual abuse, or how the practice targets young girls who have yet to define their personalities outside a structure of imposed expectations that come dressed in the guise of divine requirement.  Is polygamy funny?  Is it fair game?  Am I being all crusty about a future Emmy-winning program?  I don't know.  I'm estimating that probably 2 out of every 5 women I met in college had experienced a form of sexual abuse at a point in their lives.  I know men who have experienced sexual abuse.  Not all these people are from Utah, of course, but the topic gets me up enough to talk about it here.    Some things must just seem funnier when you're pitching them to a television production company.  Or maybe this will turn out to be a program that will help people get help.  I don't know, it could be  Titus Andronicus  for our times.  Wait and see.

      Gloriane has a signature to her emails that I've always enjoyed, so I've dug up the poem the line is taken from (Section 7, line 4):   urlLink The Carol of  Occupations.   Part  7 :   Will you seek afar off? you surely come back at last, In things best known to you, finding the best, or as good as the best, In folks nearest to you finding the sweetest, strongest, lovingest; Happiness, knowledge, not in another place, but this place—not for another hour, but this hour; Man in the first you see or touch—always in friend, brother, nighest neighbor—Woman in mother, lover, wife; The popular tastes and employments taking precedence in poems or any where, You workwomen and workmen of These States having your own divine and strong life, And all else giving place to men and women like you.

      A few weeks ago in Business Sources class, I did a presentation on product placement and talked briefly on how strange it would be to think of kids growing up in a completely product-branded reality, where the line between home and market had disappeared. I think it's a fascinating topic. Courtesy of Sports Illustrated,  urlLink here's a completely random example  of published writing that got me thinking about the topic again.  The piece is written about the Madden 2005 football video game but you'll notice too how the author identifies Playstation, Nintendo, Subway, Mountain Dew, Top Ramen Noodles, Slam Magazine, Jerry Springer, and Jet Blue Airlines, all by name. Only the details of his life  without  the products seem vague.

      Finished up Cataloging last night and now have only one project to go.  To make things even better, there's a  urlLink Neil Finn  record coming out this month.  As for the nebulous future, I was at Target with Stacey yesterday and saw signs.  Not  Signs -signs, though that was there too. But spiritual signs, or so I thought. See the TV's were all playing a Yeah Yeah Yeahs song called " urlLink Maps. "  That's surely a sign.  And in the computer lab earlier, a woman had been Photoshopping a really pretty  map  of Southern China & Tibet. Are you with me here? Is this completely ridiculous? I did score the map library a new box fan via Anthony at the Lilly yesterday. Lou was pleased about that.  On a completely unrelated note, I've been feeling peppy about John Kerry's emergence of an agenda. (When's the last time you heard a presidential candidate mention  urlLink Native American health care , for example?) He also wants to up minimum wage, free up federal funding for stem-cell research, get us some help in Iraq, get us out of Iraq, follow the 9/11 commission's report, and use alternative fuels to decrease America's oil addiction. In contrast, I have been trying to figure out what Bush's agenda is. Well, his  explicit  agenda anyway.  I can't come up with anything except the Anti-Gay marriage amendment, his hunger to drill up Alaska, and his continuing to instill us all with deep seated paranoia. Does Bush have an agenda? Can you name an item off it? Bush has likely the least articulated vision for a presidential term that I think I've ever heard a candidate express, let alone for a second term.  It makes you wonder.

      I am not looking forward to tonight. Tonight is homework. Tomorrow is homework too, for that matter. Homework is my life until Wednesday. But I just need to focus and get it done, then I get two whole weeks away from classes, though (unfortunately, I say with a sigh) not from work or IUB. Maybe you can tell I'm a little eager to get out of town, whenever that might happen again.  However, this morning, when I was feeling more awake and positive, I realized that in about ten days I will have spent a full year here in Bloomington, Indiana. Considering everything that has happened in the past year, it seems like a long time. Working at the law firm seems a lifetime ago; applying to grad school seems a lifetime ago; living in Salt Lake seems like some irretrievable illusion of contentment, which it was even when I lived there, but that's why I say 'seems.'  So when your past is fuzzy, you focus forward. You look ahead. And I've being doing that by getting out that application to the job I mentioned before, and starting to really think about where I want to be come January when I hope to once again load up the yellow Ford Focus and put Bloomington, Indiana in the rear-view mirror. My friends, I  cannot wait  to get in the car, turn up the radio, and drive myself free of graduate school. As 2Pac says (and I really have to thank Jaleh for that record), it's me against the world, baby.  By the way, my cover letter was reviewed by my bosses, and they both seemed very positive, though it is probably too early and not very bright of me to get excited now.  And fall is in the air. Hints of it. The smells are coming and the cool wind is blowing them in. That in and of itself reason to focus now; so I can get outside and go get lost in Indiana for a day or two. I can't wait for fall. I can't wait to get my free time back, my evenings back. I can't wait to sit on the porch with friends and beer on Fridays after five, I can't wait to spend Thursday nights at a restaurant, Saturday afternoons in the city, and Sunday mornings sleeping in.  All this happens after Wednesday. Sort of. Wednesday + a fall semester. Don't tell me you aren't counting the days too.

      Earlier today I found my first position to apply for as a soon-to-be librarian. Or rather  urlLink Sarah  found it and sent the link along. Very exciting. What is equally as exciting is the number of jobs in libraries overall. They are literally everywhere: across the country and at all types of facilities. I've gone from paranoia about getting a job at all to wondering how many I can reasonably apply to before I graduate. This is a fantastic time to be entering the profession.  If you need a reason to visit  urlLink Kara's new site , I found links to many of the jobs I'm excited about there. This says something, again, about the value of content-specific sites -- themed sites, topical sites -- versus the extra-myopic brand of solipsism that I tend to practice here.

       From  urlLink Kara's site , or rather its Google Ad, I found the site  urlLink DATA,  which is one pretty easy way to get involved with the African AIDS problem should you feel so inclined. There's a petition and a newsletter you can sign up for (it would be kind of novel to petition away a pandemic), as well as some pictures of Bono if you like the superstar-as-motivational speaker ticket (I do too). Anyway, check out the site if you're interested. I'm beginning to realize that volunteering and participating in your causes is not only relatively easy, but truly a source of, I don't know,  happiness .   Does that sound  cheesy?  Maybe.  But it beats complaining away your days.  If, on the other hand, you prefer inactivity think of how much that aligns you with our sorry president. The inactive will be particularly pleased with his half-assed (if not full-assed) response to the 9/11 Commission's report in which he has decided that a new information director should not be adequately funded, made a cabinet position, given any real power over the agencies its oversees, or all-in-all taken seriously. Now who wouldn't re-elect a guy like that?  On a somewhat related note -- related because it gets you thinking in new ways about information you already know or suspect to be true -- I have been enjoying the  urlLink Penguin State of the World Atlas .   urlLink Amazon's page  for the title shows you others in this publisher series, including ones on War and Peace, Women, Human Sexuality, and  urlLink Media and Information .  Today being Wednesday, we're in our last week of classes for the second Summer semester. I have a large business class project to start and finish, as well as the cataloging final -- all due next Wednesday. This is not expected to be a fun week in SLIS, but it will all get done in its own time, I'm sure.    *** News item: Was told staccato tone sounded self-important. Am double-sorry! Initially thought I was channeling Bridget Jones. Will not happen again. Love, Bill ***    Last item: the  urlLink Rallying  continues.  My reward for at least getting a little bit done while at school.

      At the map library this afternoon we had a genuine reference question.  It was about the Alaskan oil pipeline.  If you are paranoid, you can believe the patron is a possible terrorist, though my boss Heiko and I were pretty excited to have (finally!) a map question to work with.  We dug through the 7.5's, the 250,000's, the cataloged and the uncataloged until Heiko found a nice little number that plotted the oil pipeline along with Alaska's natural gas pipelines, and did so with a lot of white space to spare.    Score one for the map geeks.  For the rest of the afternoon, we were on a map high.  So Heiko pulled out a book that divvied up the map collections of all the U.S. libraries.  For some reason -- though for the life of me, I have no idea why -- we got quite a kick out of that.  We made fun of libraries that had fewer globes than we do.   We were giggling like school kids.  I don't know why.  Globes are just... ridiculous.    Yeah.  Obviously you had to be there.

      Was hired to work the  urlLink Information Commons  starting later this month, which is great news.  Also have an excellent intership at the Map Library this fall with Dr. Kinsey's wasp maps.  This last item is cleverly timed to coincied with the release of the Kinsey film.    All part of concerted effort to have best possible resume by time I leave IU.  Not sure how I feel about breaking up posts into short items - especially as I don't yet know how to categorize these posts.  Secretly suspect will be gouging other site and reformatting it for Movable Type.  Am enjoying having this untrafficked site to post to, especially when away from home.  Wish I knew better how to do CSS.

        Honestly.  None.  But this blog is free, whereas other, you know, requires me to work a little.   Pressure to write stunning introductory commentary is overwhelming, but am resisting successfully by being completely dull. Am enjoying noir-esque tone and clipped sentences. Hope you enjoy too.  All right.  Am posting now.  Soon will be having coffee and continuing mad exploits in ESPN NFL 2K5.
