      I leave for South Carolina Saturday morning to meet my family at Myrtle Beach. I'm actually driving down from Boston, and plan on making it down in a one day trip. You never know how these things will work out, especially driving on your own. Maybe I'll love it. Maybe I won't. Maybe I'll get arrested. Or maybe I'll fall asleep and drive into the ocean. Or maybe I'll get kidnapped by raging mutated inbreds while in the hills of some backwards state... alas, it only happens this way in the movies.  I can't wait to lay on a beach all day with Coronas and yell at women.   But I always feel wierd getting drinks with my parents around. They NEVER had drinks when we were growing up. So it still makes me feel out of place when I have a beer in front of them. I know, I'm old enough to do whatever, but somehow that doesn't apply. They are still parents. But who knows, maybe I can get my dad to have a few and open up about some things. I think there are some stories I'd never hear about otherwise; I just know he was an idiot, I just can't prove it.  If I ever have kids, will they wonder if I was an idiot kid? I think they'll know. This generation has so more access to pictures and videos than our parents did. Honestly, I've only seen a few pictures of my mom or dad from their teenage years or their twenties. So it's scary to think that my kids might get ahold of some of the drunken pictures I've got laying around, or even worse, videos I've made with friends (The Bears is a great example, even though you could never PROVE it was me. A New Years video, however, is a different story). Hey, maybe my parents did have these, but threw away the evidence. But I don't think so.  And think about how many pictures they have seen of THEIR parents from their younger years. It's barely a handful. And these pictures are usually very formal things, in suits, or in group pictures with the entire family. You'd never see them passed out drunk in a bathtub, or running around a bonfire with no clothes on. You know they did these things (or something like it), but they just didn't have access to recording their history like we do. So my parents had even less of an understanding of their parents than I have of mine.  And so I think we're all raising a different generation of kids right now, that have so much access to the past that they'll be able to find out almost anything they want about what's come before them. Obviously, there will be the school reports, the research of our current events (their history), which will be amazing because of how much they could know. But what happens when they decide to research their parents? And so what happens when your 12 year old kid sees pictures of the "Photo Shoot" that just happened to be shot without any clothes, or a website made for an ex-fiance? They'll understand us in a way we never understood our parents. I'm scared already.  Anyways, I'm just excited to drink beer on a beach.

      I woke up last night passed out on my floor with porn on the computer screen staring back at me. I was still too drunk to feel pathetic, and too tired to care.  Otherwise, the night was great. Going out on a Tuesday and getting loaded isn't always an easy thing, especially when your boss decides to call you way too early in the morning to wake you up.   Sometimes what I love about life though, is that you can be almost incoherent and drunk one minute, then just 9 hours later find yourself walking around the city pretending to be a real grown up.  Dave and I met up with the drummer last night. It was perfect; she was perfect. I wasn't sure we could find what we needed, or if we even knew what that was. But she was great, and it should work out fine, as long as she can keep a beat, of course. We talked and drank, and when she left we had the inevitable conversation of having a threesome with her. We agreed that we would.  And so on my walk home I decided to call up a friend, his wife answered, and I ended up hitting on her and then randomly yelling words or phrases, my favorite being "sesame seed chicken". I'm afraid I can't remember much more than that.

      I've been buying way too much music lately, and having people burn their CD's for me, and I just realized that's I've replaced any sort of relationship with a woman with music. But that's beside the point. Here are some recommendations, with songs below if you download stuff:  THE PIXIES- Doolittle download "Monkey Gone to Heaven" or anything, really  BUILT TO SPILL- Keep It Like a Secret. download "The Plan" or "You Were Right"  BRITISH SEA POWER- The Decline of British Sea Power. "Remember Me" or "Lately"  NICK CAVE AND THE BAD SEEDS "Red Right Hand" or "Lay Me Low"  INTERPOL-  Turn On the Bright Lights "Obstacle 1" or "NYC"  MODEST MOUSE- Good News for People Who Love Bad News "World at Large" or "Float On"  LORETTA LYNN- Van Lear Rose "Porland Oregan"  By the way, Loretta Lynn is an old gospel/country singer who just made an album with Jack White of the White Stripes producing and playing guitar. It sounds great. This is "real"  country music, bitches.

      Does God or some form of god try to speak to people? Is there some sort of guiding spirit that actually send us messages? I'm not sure. But if there was, I'm convinced that today the message was sent through a 50 year old gay guy on the subway at 6:45 in the fucking morning. What was the message? Well, I don't really want to go into it. But I'll tell you this: it had nothing to do with being gay.  Speaking of gay, I had a strange moment the other day. We had a lot of weddings this weekend at the hotel, and while checking two guys into a room, I realized that these guys WERE the wedding. They were the ones getting married. Disturbing? No. Shocking? You bet your ass.  BAND UPDATE: Dave (lead guitar) and I (vocals/rhythm acoustic) are meeting up tomorrow with Katie (drums). We still need a bass...

      Friday night I got drunk with some guys from the hotel, and I can't remember talking about anything other than the band we are starting, and asian women. I guess there is a bar in Boston where 99% of the people are asians. We almost went just because we wanted to be the big white giants in a sea of asian women. After the bars, we went back to this kids apartment, where I passed out right after we ate burnt hot dogs and were tired of calling up the call girls in the phone book.  So far, here are possible band names: 1) Heroin for Breakfast, and 2) Consider My Liver. We hate the second one, but it's all we've got, okay?  My roomate Colby has friends in town, and it seems like there are 10 of them. So last night they all went out and came back in a frenzy. I talked to one of them while half asleep, and all I could remember was that Nate was tearing up the place, and they had women in the apartment. It sounded awful, but I wished I was involved. Man, I miss tearing shit up.

      So I'm planning on getting a new used truck sometime in the next month to month and a half. I've narrowed it down to an F-150 or a Tundra, but that's not important. I don't konw what color I want. I need some sort of "I have 2 B-holes" color that makes a proud statement about who I am and what I do (with an additional "yay!" at the end). I was thinking gray, but just about everything I own is gray. Dark colors are out because I don't want the truck to get too hot and steamy inside. White is probably out because it shows too much dirt. What's left? I don't know.  Clint, when are you coming to Florida? Brian, you need to take away chief's chief pipe and move to FL too.   urlLink www.shoutcast.com  - commercial free radio through winamp. I love it.

      I'd like to get in a few thoughts on how gay- or undergay- the three of us are.  On myself:  I've never really thought about it before, but I just realized something very disturbing. Follow me now:  as of that night (my kiss with Brian), I'd never had a girlfriend. And so if you think about it, I had never even kissed a girl... This much I've known. And besides the fact that I was 17 year old idiot who had never kissed a girl, I can accept this.  But what I've never thought about is this: was Brian my first kiss? Did I really kiss a boy before I kissed a girl? This I cannot accept. I know I was forced to kiss a girl in that game, too. Was it before Brian or after? It's all hazy. My memory is failing me. Could this be right? What is wrong with me?  Some other comments: I'm suprised that Brian thinks I don't hug, I love hugs, damnit. Yes, I shower too long, I have a ritual, and it's too long. But you can't skip a step! And finally, I'm suprised that Brian thinks I'm the least gay looking of all of us. Brian looks just like his dad, and NO ONE has ever thought Dan the Man was gay. Aaron...okay, his hair is gay, and he does work out a lot... But what about me? The tight clothes? The skinny frame? The hair? And what about how I sleep with men?  On Brian: I've never really thought he was gay. Pretty normal, actually. Law school student. A wife. Plays golf. Short hair... But then we complete the triangle... Clothes come off. Guys are humped. Chiffon shirts are worn. It's a mess. But it's a lovely mess. But for god's sakes, do something about the shoe problem.  On Aaron: So, Aaron's not gay? He's had some people convinced. But I've seen him in action when he's hitting on women. It's too genuine and awful to be fake.  And another thing, anal sex has nothing to do with being gay. Believe me, I know lots of women that are doing it. Okay, so I don't, but you could imagine (and I do).

      OK, i got to thinking about the spectrum of homosexuality we represent based upon our test results and I want to analyze whether it is actually accurate.   Clive - Seriously Undergay - Well, I know that Clint definitely didn't want to kiss me that time we were playing truth or dare during the mission trip of all places.  I don't even think girls have ever been that opposed to kissing me.   He never really gives anyone a hug, boy or girl.  I think the less physical contact clint has with guys, the better his day is. Finally, after researching gay and lesbian rights and seeing numerous pictures of the types of people we are talking about.  I think clive is the least gay looking of us 3.  That, however, is just a hunch.  This doesn't mean that Clint is a homophobe.  He just doesn't want to be gay himself. I can remember frequent times when he tells numerous people his desire to stick it in her ass.  Granted, he is talking about girls, but he does seem to be infatuated with anal sex at times.  Also, clive does spend more time than any of us in the bathroom getting ready.  Seriously, all it takes is...shower on, spin, lather, rinse, wash, rinse, spin, towel off...it's over.  I put my clothes on immediately and sometimes fail to even brush my teeth. Overall, i'd say seriously undergay fits him nicely.  Me - Slightly Undergay - I love sports, eating, scratching my balls, and basically acting like an idiot.  It takes me about 7 minutes to get ready in the morning.  Anal sex is a little frightening for me and I spend most of my free time staring at hot chicks, sizing them up, and discussing what they look like naked. However, I have way too many pairs of shoes.  I have way to many jackets and other apparrel accessories.  Sometimes I get a little sentimental when I talk to you guys(all you have to do is read my postings).  And lets face it, for the right amount of money, i'd be willing to do just about anything.  Not to mention the fact that chief was worried at one point that we were gay. Overall, i think there are several areas that I do not fit inside the gay stigma that wouldn't be so bad if I improved in them, but then again, NO.    bhole - All i'm going to say is that he talks way too often about anal sex and has used way too many gay sex jokes around us.  He has also prompted more than one person to beg the question, "is he gay?"   Overall, there is no way bhole is gay, even though his screen name is "i have 2 b-holes"(why would a straight person need 2?) and he has made some of us think.  He likes having sex with Amy way too much to ever stop that routine and for the most part likes sports, eating, scratching his balls(he is the one that introduced me to the differing theories of ball scratching) and all the other typical guy behavior that makes him a nice and even "just gay enough."  Keep up the good work, I'm outta here.

      I am sitting in this back room completely not doing any work.  It is awesome.  Although, if any of my employers get wind of this site i'm screwed.  I really don't have much to say other than it is good to see bhole finally figured out how to work the internet after spending 6 years in school to figure out computers.   The whole "sure" thing.  I think that might be subliminally correct.  I'm using that from now on.

      I was discussing the possibility of moving to Fort Myers with someone yesterday, and apparently she was against it because she claimed that maybe it wasn't the place (boston) that made me unhappy, maybe what made me unhappy was MYSELF. I never even said I was unhappy with Boston. I hate talking to people when I'm not drinking. It's so much harder to yell at them.  Anyways, speaking of listening, maybe this is old news, but has anyone else listened closely to the end of Sound of Urchin's "Happy" (track 14)? As the song fades out, he starts giving random shout-outs to things like cable, checks and balances, and my personal favorite, soda. That's what I call moxie, bitches.  Oh, and I learned "Torn" on the guitar the other day. Natalie Imbruglia ladies and fucking gentleman.

      Thanks for the compliments. My desperate pleas for attention are sometimes more fun than actually dating women. At least, I tell myself that until I wake up at night with my cock in my hand.  Here's how it unfolded:   I got up to leave, was walking out the door of the bar and realized I left my card, turning to see my lovely running towards me. Alas, she only wanted me to pay the bill. A couple at the bar, realizing I was stupid and drunk, asked me if I'd pay for all their drinks. At that point I said the now infamous (it's MORE than famous) line, "Oh yeah, put those on there...And then go ahead and..." The rest is history.   To my credit, the guy there with me tells me she seemed flattered by the whole ordeal.   In related news, the drummer will be meeting us sometime this week for drinks. Dry-wall sex will be planned at a later date... By the way, ever heard of toast-fucking?

      I thought I was the most effective person at alienating hot bartenders as of the last time we got together.  I can see that I just wasn't persistent, nor even creative enough to compete with an inspired Clive.  I mean lets face it, all I said to one of the girls was "So you speak Spanish, Que tiempo es?"  That was it, she obviously didn't want anything more to do with me and I gave up.  I even felt bad for making her turn and run the other direction.  I pail in comparison.   Evaluating Clive's response, this is the point where he would just be beginning.  It is the chase that I should have looked forward to, not simply the solicitation.  How could I have been so nieve.  Clive, you must tell me more.  You have to tell me where you come up with lines like "go ahead and charge the amount it would take to buy your love."  That is incredible.  You've taken a seemingly routine situation at the end of the evening and completely turned it into a direct last chance desperation plea for attention.  Awesome.  no, Perfection. One question, did she add anything to your bill?  It might have worked and you didn't even know it. On a side note, i'm done with classes, i don't really care what grades i get, i'm white, i've been drunk for about 4 days since finals ended, the pacers lost last night, i kicked chief's ass at golf yesterday, lindsey lohan is smokin' hot for a 17 year old, the movie lost in space was a complete waste of more than 2 hours, Nate is a bitch, Colby rocks, recycle that shit, researching gay and lesbian rights isn't the funnest thing to do at work, my piss is bright yellow from all the vitamin B-12, and finally I just got confused for a woman.

      Well I went out last night, and drank some beer. Eventually I started talking to women. It never goes particularly well, because I try to see how far I can push them, and let's face it, everyone has a point where they're like, you're going to have to shut the fuck up.   Anyways, I was asked by someone to tell the bartendress that I loved her, so I did this, while giving multiple reasons for loving her. She didn't love me back. I told her I'd accept her "unrequited love." I don't even know what that word means. As a final effort, while closing the tab, I told her to "Go ahead and bill me for whatever it takes to buy your love." God I love myself. I feel like I'm in middle school all over again. SPIN MOVE!

      1 more test to go, and I feel completely fucked at this point.  I'm sort of reaching panic mode.  Not good for studying conditions.  I knew this day was coming and I just continued to put it off.  Why do I do this to myself.   Good news is that everyone else feels like they are retarded too.  So I will be in good company when I fail.   So bhole, it is good to see you check the page after all.  I was getting worried about you.(again, I probably sound gay) Clive, any luck w/the drummer chick.  Have you guys had sex yet?  Tell her that the best way to spark each other's creative side is to get in a good rail session, you know, put her head through the drywall.  It might work.  Plus, if you do actually put her head through the drywall that would give her a whole new outlook on your(or hers)apartment. I'm out like a fat kid(Emerick-Me) in dodgeball.

      OK, i just had about 4 pages of stuff typed and when I went to publish it, it disappeared.  No way in hell I'm retyping everything so here is a quick summary. 1)  My test sucked last night   a)  it consisted of:     1) T/F questions that could go either way including one that asked "Do you think..." how can someone get counted off for something they think?     2)  Multiple Choice Questions that were able to eliminate 3 choices quickly, but left w/2 choices that were completely identical, only worded differently   b)  I'm going to kill my professor 2)  I'm going golfing tonight if you want to come? 3)  I miss golfing with you fuckers(the vulgarity is to reduce sentimentality)   a)  the last time we were golfing together, you 2 turned my minister cousin to the dark side   b)  my favorite line from that day was when he said to you 2; "You guys need to get some girl friends."   c)  So bhole did and Clive was busy ruining an engagement 4)  There is a 27 year old hottie in my class that needs it and I think Clint should get with her. Good day, Tank Slagknuckle(sorry clive, you waited too long)

      So, the drummer girl wrote me back. She wants to know when we play... Poor girl.  I know it's Tuesday, but I want to write about my weekend. It sucked, but we found a good bar downtown that has cheap beer and a great jukebox. The hour or so we were there we heard the Pixies, Radiohead, and Wilco. Afterwards, we met the women that played the songs and followed them. They thought I was cute, so I more or less called them old. And then I called one of them "Whitey." Our friendship was tragically cut short.  I hope that someday I'll learn to deal with women.

      Dude, that is a good word.  How is it you run across that in your daily travels?  Another question, what is it this sex thing?  Alright, well, I have about 5 hours until my exam and I doubt that I'll be as prepared as I need to be.  Speaking of exams, I want to get something off my chest. Stop telling me you rocked it, you rocked it out, you are going to rock it, you rock starred it, etc.  What the fuck does this mean.  The word rock does not have that many meanings, nor should it.  I hate when people say it in this manner and I hate the people that do it.  Someone honestly said the above phrases in less than a minute to describe  A) how they did on an exam B) what they were going to do later C) how they thought they were going to do on an exam later on D) the type of gay sex they were having Well, all but the last one is true.  Does this "rocking it" bother anyone else?  Am I the only person that knows about it and I am the only one people say it to?  The next person that says "rocked it" dies.

      I have just taken another step towards my goal of being in a real band. Not that She Touched It wasn't real. It was. I loved our half-assed practices in barns or garages, and the brainstorming sessions we had in my shitty ass apartment when Jeff lived with me at Purdue. But let's face it, nobody ever saw us play. That, and we sucked.  Anyways, I just contacted this girl, she's a beginner, and she plays drums. Can we still be called "KY and the Brown Eye" with a girl in the band? We'll see. Maybe I'll bring back Tony Extravadanza. The possibilities make my mind boil. And yes that's a good thing.  Now if we can just get that same magic that She Touched It had when we played "Scotty Would You Like Some Sausage?".

      So, I have a feeling that bhole is not going to be keeping us up to date with his daily goings on and what have you.  That son of a bitch.  It's not enough that I know he's got a jew and a sardine.   Me you ask, well, I'm at the library.  Again.  Be here tomorrow too.  Probably the next day.  But I do plan on golfing either tonight or Wednesday for sure.  Maybe you guys could road trip on out here and we'll hit the linx.  $100 a hole? Dude, there is this trip to Vegas from Cleveland only $280 per person for Air and Hotel.  Not too shabby, that is usually the price of airfare alone.  I'm thinking about taking chief out there this summer, just for joke though, nothing more.  You guys should head out there too.  What would be better than us three terrorizing The Vegas?  I'm at a loss.  All the strippers we could patronize, the number of hotel security teams we could be black balled from.  It would be awesome.  Not to mention all the food buffets, and Celine Dion.  Kidding, kind of.   Another thing, i'm drinking water out of a coke can.  It is kind of a let down once you take a drink.  You see Coke and you expect that sugary taste, but no, it's nothing, just water.  Reminds of the Cheerleader I dated in High School.  She was a freshman hottie, but when I actually started talking to her, I wanted to punch her in the face.  Not what I had hoped for.  Ironically, her name was also Sara, maybe she's my neighbor?

      You know what I like about this.  I can sit here and look around at people and then think of things to say about them and they have NO IDEA.   I.E. Bombs is here again!!!!!!!!!!! No one else in the library around me is in law school, so what the fuck are they doing spending a spectacular day in the library.  It's not like you actually study when you are in college.  Then again, I'm pretty sure they are the same people that studied in the Purdue Library on the weekends if you catch my drift.  These people need something better to do.  I need something better to do. Well, i'm glad I could join you, now take your clothes off.  Oh yeah, I forgot.  I woke up today and it was actually sunny and hot out for the first time in forever.  So I decided to go outside and get a tan on my white bob while reading.  The problem is that after about 10 minutes of laying out, I kind of felt like a giant tool because here I am, no shirt, shorts rolled up, other people's houses are only like 10 feet away and the last thing they want to see is me.  Sure enough my ancient neighbor comes outside.  I felt a little awkward.

I can only dream that one day, she will give me this same, lovely death stare. I could explain, but would it really matter?

      I have officially lost all inhibitions around the people at work and I'm saying the most random things that come to my head. For Example - My diabetes was acting up and I couldn't get out of bed. That was the reason I gave for being 45 minutes late to work today. I hope they didn't believe me, they were all laughing so I doubt it, but you never know with this crowd. They either believe everything or just think everything is funny, i'm not sure yet. So A is done and doesn't want us to go check out his new crib in Florida because of his main bitch.  That's cold.  C, tickets from Boston to Akron definitely hover around the $50-65 mark the week that you were talking about. (one way flight tickets) So book it now and I'll see you later this month. Sweet. We'll definitely go get wasted downtown and maybe we could check out an Indians game. We can't forget to eat pizza at Johnny Malloy's and I'll be sure to get Lindsay involved in some way shape or form. Hopefully she'll take the shape of a quad fuck 2005. Chief will be gone next week, she is leaving this friday. Once again, the old lady is taking off to another city without me. I'm starting to get the message. But atleast I can act like a bachelor again. Well, before I go i need to complain about work again. This whole time I have totally neglected this simple project I have to do. I just found out yesterday that I have to present it to the Judge in a week. Let's just say I have a lot of work to do before I can say anything intelligent to the Judge. Peace

      I'm moving to Las Vegas.  That is the place to be.  I don't know if you guys have ever been there but damn.   why las vegas is better than cleveland 1.  only 4 inches of rain a year 2.  it was 104 degrees, but it only felt like 90 degrees  3.  no clouds 4.  hot ass bitches everywhere 5.  free drinks everywhere you go (as long as you are gambling, unless you stay at a cheap hotel that needs people to go there like I did) 6.  buffets as far as the eye can see (only good if you have a fast metabolism) 7.  every other corner has a group of mexicans wearing shirts that say "strippers direct to you" and they are practically throwing porn and stripper advertisements at you no matter who you are 8.  old grandmas that wear the t-shirts and push porn on you 9.  everything is open 24 hours 10.  elvis impersonators all over the place 11.  the hotels are ludacrous 12.  did i mention the strippers yet?  Why cleveland is better than las vegas 1.  i usually don't drop $400 in 3 days in cleveland and have nothing to show for it 2.  there are actually seasons of the year and you're not in a desert with the nearest water source like 40 miles away.

      Sorry, not Wilco related.  I had the dream where you're driving and the brakes don't work earlier this week (or was it last?). It got me wondering: before cars were around, did people have dreams about riding out of control horses or wagons? Do pilots dream about flying planes that don't respond? That would be crazy.

      So far, this blog has been filled with quality crap. I love it. I especially like to read about how C's Doctor thinks he's depressed. Man, it reminds me of my own depression. Oh well. On the bright side, I am going to Vegas in like 2 days. I'll be getting lots of mixed drinks and spending lots of money that the government loaned me for education. They never said not to spend it educating myself on how to play blackjack and craps so, I figure, why not.  So I am sitting on the train coming home from work and this pretty cute girl gets on at the same time as me. There is no one on the train except for like 5 people, however, I almost wanted to sit in the seat next to her. Just for joke though. How I would have explained that I needed to sit next to her I don't know. It didn't happen so I didn't have to think of anything. Instead, I watched all the graffiti go by. it's just as good.  About reading, the only thing I plan on voluntarily reading this summer is the boxes to all the James Bond movies before I watch them. I had a conversation with one of the guys at work how, pretty soon, if i had my way. I would totally replace reading books with just watching the movie. It is so much easier and stays in your head longer than any damn page with words on it. Not to mention its easier and only takes like 2 hours to complete. This way, I can completely take away the creativity of america's youth and secure myself on top of the world.  By the way, who wrote the book that turned out to be the movie "the order" with heath ledger, they need to be a part of the bad author's club tavern. That movie sucked. Sin Eaters? More like shiteaters.com.  I think the Judge is going to call on me tomorrow to recite our assignment. He has memorized my name and asked if i was ready to do it today. That can only spell trouble that he knows my name. So far I have dodged his aggression. Now i'm fucked.  Before I go, a definitely underrated dessert...animal crackers. especially the ones with the lightly coated frosting. Deeelicious. Type on.

      I had my doctor appointment today and it went well, other than that they think I'm depressed, and I may have a hairline fracture in my right leg. But my blood pressure is perfect. Actually she said, "Normal is 140 and anything under is great, and you're at 115." And then I said, "So I'm perfect." She didn't disagree.  On my way home on the subway there were tons of hot women heading to the Red Sox game. And so I read my book, which is written by this angry old man (Bukowski) who is obsessed with his death, betting at horse tracks, and his own death. I could tell the girl next to me was reading it. Poor girl. I wanted to slap it (IT being my cock) on her neck. I thought about talking to her till I realized I wouldn't. And so that's that.  A really odd thing though, is that I was walking through the city today and saw a bar called the Bukowski Tavern, with a sign that said "BAD AUTHOR'S CLUB" in the window. I have to go, because you know these people are all obsessed with death. A great crowd, to be sure.

      Okay, sorry, but it has been another hectic week.  First, as my comments to the other postings state, no luck with the new girlfriend.  I think that whole married thing scared her off.  Understandable, but now i'm going to pimp clint for him so that when he visits it will be nothing but movie quoting people around me. It's funny that i like movie quotes and lyric quotes so much.  I think it's because I would much rather not think of things to say on my own.  It is a hassle.  Not to mention the fact that it is always cooler when what you said can be related back to something else.  It automatically extends the conversation.  Now you have to talk about where it came from, who said it, what else they have done, whether they liked it or not, if they like to binge drink?  All of these things are likely responses to the simple; "That's what she said."  Plus, you seem as cool as the movie or song you quote without actually being cool at all.  They just automatically associate you with the feeling they get from the movie.  If they like it, they will want to suck it.  If they hate it, probably assasination is the best step. I went and saw dodgeball over the weekend.  I don't know if I would tell anyone else to waste that much money on the theatre, but definitely make sure to rent it.  If you liked Zoolander, you'll like dodgeball.  Fucking hilarious.  I especially liked Christine Taylor(ben stiller's wife).  Dude, Lindsay Lohan who.   Speaking of Lindsay, Debbie Downer was the funniest skit i've seen in a while.  We were just talking about it today with the Geeks.  Although, the geeks I work with are not that bad.  They are growing on me.  Maybe I'm just becoming one of them, but they gave me a ride to school today so they can't be that bad.  They want to get a night together where we all go to an Indians game on Friday night.  They want to be completely sloshed by the time the game rolls around so I'm probably going to be going for the gold that night.  I leave for Vegas in less than 4 days.  I'm as pumped as iron.  That's all.

      I've only been back from vacation for a week and I'm already wanting to scream at the hotel guests for things as minor as requesting toothpaste. Couldn't they fucking remember to bring their own? I hate them.   I arrive at work and shut down, just let my body go through the motions.   I only wake up when guests get angry. I'm suddenly alive again. It's all up to me; I have some sort of control when they argue. I could ruin their vacation. I could make them not just hate me, but hate the entire city. I like that control for a few seconds, and then it's not fun anymore.  On a different note (still at the hotel), once there were two couples on vacation together. The two men were old friends from around college. One had made himself into something respectable, seemed to be intelligent, and had an attractive, classy wife. The other guy's life seemed like a mess. His credit card wouldn't work (the respectable guy ended up paying), he looked like a slob, complained the whole time, and had a hot but stupid girlfriend. I was forced to spend some time with these people and watched how one man was constantly arguing and defending himself, the other was doing his best to keep the entire vacation from falling apart. Here's my point: back in college, they were probably the same. After college, one grew up, the other didn't. They started at the same point but grew apart because one was unable to take himself seriously. It was sad to watch but I couldn't help thinking that this could happen with my friends. Who would grow up? Who will end up the outcast? Who will live with their parents after 30? or 40? Will I ever have sex again?   Sometimes I think my brain is eating itself.

      I swear, i'm going to kill my professor.  This is bullshit.  That asshole gave me a C.  He's dead.  He needs to be assaulted for that hoooey.  Not only that but he made me wait a month to find out that I got a C.  Son of a bitch.  There goes Dean's list.  Mother Fucker.    Enough of that, although I would like to borrow and line from Clive and tell him to Shut the Fuck up before I'm done.  So, I need to get drunk tonight and get some ass.  One of those things will be easier to do than the other.  I'll let you decide.    Although, things are looking up with the girl at work.  I'm totally infatuated with her.  Maybe not but you hear what I'm saying.  I find myself wanted to flirt with her a lot.  It's really too bad that she isn't attractive.  I mean, we ate lunch together today, and she totally quotes movies all the time.  Good movies, not like Ya Ya Sisterhood or anything but Breakfast Club.  "Let's take a look at what life is like at Big Bri's house."  That's good shit, she said it.  Anyway, I was sitting in trial all day long and then the salad I had for lunch was starting to get a little squeemish.  So my new girlfriend is sitting next to me and my body is totally making the "i have to fart so bad that i think i'll squeal back up into the colon and let everyone know I have to fart" sound.  That is the worst.  To make that worst scenario even more bad, I couldn't shake it out my one opportunity to go to the bathroom.  So for like 4 hours my body is writhing trying to find the one position that doesn't create a squealing sound.  didn't happen.  Although leaning forward slightly did quell it somewhat.  I'm going to watch the NBA finals tonight, not that you give 2 shits, or even 1 shit for that matter.  However, I did get to see the Lindsey Lohan (way hotter than Avril) SNL again, it was glorious.  Too bad she isn't an extern.  That would make life perfect.

      Today at the magazine I had another nice argument. It's so stupid. At one point I told my Senior Art Director to "Shut the fuck up." This was after he told me that I needed to "learn how to have a conversation." It's the most childish thing I've ever been a part of. The good news, though, is that he's leaving at the end of this month.  I bought a bag of Sour Patch Kids today. I love them more than people.  Did anyone see Jon Stewart rip apart Jennifer Love Hewitt during her interview on the Daily Show? Well, she's in the new Garfield movie and she came on to promote it. Here's what I remember.  JS: So Bill Murray did the voice for Garfield. JLH: Yeah, isn't that great...Bill Murray! JS: Man, Bill Murrary must be some whore for money right now...  He went on to say that "Garfield was popular in the 80's but now... not so much." And when they showed a clip, "Wow you'd almost think that cats are REAL." Wow. Reminds me of Craig Kilborn on the Daily Show, back before he wasn't a bitch. Remember when Craig spent an entire show insisting he be called "Kibbles-In-Bits," claiming they had bought his re-naming rights?  I watched Adult Swim last night and saw a show called Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Has anyone heard of this? It was  about a milkshake, french fries, and a meatball. I would tell you about it but it makes no sense, but it's really really funny. The Brak show was terrible, I was so dissapointed. It used to be hilarious.

      God what a loser I am. I'm sitting here listening to the SNF soundtrack. What's playing right now? "How Deep Is Your Love". One things for sure though, "A Fifth of Beethoven" still pleasures my socks.  You know, it wasn't too long ago that you could find us parading around in disco costumes. Or chiffon shirts. Or naked Indian costumes. Or like the time Jeff and I showed up at Jami's party wearing our Lebanon letter jackets. The confusion. THE AWKARD CONFUSION! The look of "I think it's supposed to be funny, but I don't quite get it, and nobody else is laughing, so maybe they're serious, so I'll just stare." The kind of moment when even your friends are having doubts. Screaming gibberish through entire karaoke songs. Wearing headphones that are plugged into nothing to the bars. Dry humping in a stranger's basement. These things don't happen nearly often enough anymore.  Anyways, enough of that. I've been so bored the last two days. I've talked to almost no one (though I did manage to smoke up yesterday). I need to have sex. My mind is going to explode. I'm thinking of getting a call girl but I'm afraid I'll get beat up. Nate moved out this morning, I was going to say goodbye but I was half asleep. And too lazy. I downloaded IM, nobody I know is on here. So depressing. No Chrisann to sweat over. No Pam to irritate. And no MojoBag12. I miss MojoBag12.

      I am addicted to Gobstoppers! This week I have eaten nearly 140 Gobstoppers. If you get the 7oz. box there is a crypto thingy on the back. It already has the code broken down for you (A=21, B=23, etc.) because it was meant for little kids, but I was able to translate the message without lifting a pencil because I am an  urlLink ADULT . So this stupid litte non-crypto says, "check out wonka's web site www.wonka.com." That's rather shamelss. To top it off, not one inch below the non-crypto it says, "enter the wild world of wonka and wonka.com." Plus, the answer is on the box. How many times do you have to put your web address on a box? Anyway, if you want to be completely annoyed, go to  urlLink www.wonka.com .

      So, i'm sitting at my computer trying to find all the techno music that I have on this POS, and I don't have too much to listen to.  Tomorrow (friday) is a Federal day off, being a federal employee, I'm gonna kick it off by getting drunk by myself on Thursday night.  Wait...I already am.    So what did I do all day you ask, well, got on the train and went to work.  I had to memorize this fact sheet but it was exceedingly difficult because of this dude banging his head, repeatedly, into the window.  That shit had to hurt.   During the work day, me and the other retarded externs, except for this girl Colleen who I find extremely attractive even though she couldn't hold a candle to someone like Avril Lavegne(?), were talking about getting T-shirts made and parading around public.  (That conversation was probably the only one I wanted to participate in during the entire day)  Anyway, we get to discussing the shirt and I mention that it would be a shirt that you would find at Goodwill and you would have to buy it because it is so weird.  I next wanted to tell them about the NADS shirt that I got from Goodwill.  Well, while explaining that while rooting for your team, Nads, you would say "Go Nads" one of the girls completely did not get it.  She wanted me to explain, not just that they are reproductive organs, but on which one (guys or girls) and then asked whether they were below the waste.  What was I supposed to do there?  I wanted to bitch slap this girl so bad for being such a dipshit.  Instead, I made fun of the way she talked for the rest of day by mocking her voice and mannerisms.  You need to know that this girl acts like she came straight out of the movie clueless.  Anyway, I was having a good time for the rest of the day, and she never caught on that I was completely dissing her the entire day.  I love it.  Before I end this subject, I told her that my friend Clive would like to date her because she is skinny.  Then I walked away from her.  Have I talked enough about how much these people are dipshits?  I tried telling one of them over lunch the other day about the disruption that the 3 of us like to cause when we get together.  I specifically referred to invading that house party with the pizzas at Purdue.  The sombrero, the pizza, the karaoke, the fact that we were completely uninvited, the fact that Rob wasn't invited back for another party there again.  He didn't get anything about that story.  I guess I should be used to that by now since I don't really think anyone understands where we are coming from.    Another thing, I'm taking it upon myself to watch every single James Bond movie in the next couple weeks.  THe other day, me chief and a couple other people watched all 5 star wars in one day all the while we ate nothing but star wars food from my star wars cookbooks.  Jedi Juice Pops, Greedo's Buritos, Darth Maul Lightsaber Hotdogs (that's 2 feet of hot dog), Twin Sun Tatooine Toast, Darth Maults, it was one hell of an extravaganza and I was the only one to watch every single second of every movie.  So i've been typing for a while, yet i feel like there is so much else to say.  My car still doesn't run, the ditzy girl has a better GPA than I do, Calvin poops on the back deck instead of the yard when it rains, I want to sing, I want to dance, I'm buying a ticket to Boston tomorrow - chief is out of town and I could easily get out there and back before chief does.  Tickets are only $50 each way.  Damn it, it is so tempting.  Peace i'm out.

      I did think you were gonna to give it up to me. That was a dirty trick you played on me.   Yes, I told you I loved you. And yes, it was a lie. I guess you could say that I tricked you, too.   But listen: words are words and sex is sex, and it's much more fun to do it than to sit on your bed and talk about not doing it. So I guess I'll just see you tomorrow at school.

      To start, bhole's comment to that last posting made me laugh.  Mainly because I can see him saying that to your face and then that would be the end of the conversation for about 20 minutes.   Anyway, that music is all I listen to.  I'm sorry i'm not as cool as you guys and can waste my time searching for undiscovered, underground, underwear bands.  I'm sure I'll get around to listening to that shoutcast shit, but probably not for another couple months.   Let me be the first to tell you that having 2 jobs sucks my ass.  I'm at the courthouse all day then I come to school and try to get some money at a paying job for about 10 hours a week.  I almost spend as much time getting from the courthouse to here as I do time at the 2nd job.  To make things worse, my car died and I don't really know what to do about it.  One idea is to set it up with explosives, but that won't solve anything.   Avril Lavegne or whatever is not even attractive.  I have this picture in my head that she has filed down her teeth and looks like a freak with a microphone.  Then I start thinking about Amy Poehler making fun of her on SNL.  That is funny shit.  Yeah, but not attractive.  You know who is attractive = Dido.  Sure her name sucks, but with a clear lack of creativity in the name there has to be something more to her.  There is, her jugs.   Speaking of unattractive, i'm wearing this pea green button up shirt and matching tie, and I'm thinking I don't look real good.  Chief thought I did so i went along with it.  What do you guys think? Sorry for not posting any more on this blog, there is no internet access readily available anymore.  The internet stations the buildings do have I am not about to get caught chatting and posting on this site.  I'll be out of there in no time.  I'm not even supposed to be accessing my email from that place.  So basically, i'm at a loss of internet time to do this stuff.   Before I go, i did go back and comment on the past postings if you want to check those out.  Peace

      Tonight I started a game that I thought could be fun because it involved drinking and doing things by myself.   I decided that on my walk home (from the North End to Fenway) I would visit AT LEAST 10 different bars.   The Rules:  one beer = 10 minutes  OR  two beers = 30 minutes  AND  No more than 2 beers at one bar.  Sadlly, I failed. Around the 6th bar, I decided to visit the place I was fired from last Fall. Met a really hot blonde Irish girl that worked in the gift shop, and gave in to the sweet talking of the bartender while I was drinking. I ended up staying an hour. Somewhere in there I called Brandon. He picked me up, and we eventually went to meet his friends. We got to his bar (which would have been the 8th bar), but they didn't let me in because of my sandles. I said "that girl has sandles on". They said that it was women's wear. After the argument, I went to change my shoes (luckily I was two blocks from my apartment).   But when I got back, there was another argument about a cover charge that, somehow, Brandon and everyone else didn't have to pay. I started yelling. Mostly at Brandon. The last words I said to him were "I was having a much better time by myself before I met up with this shit tonight." He said, "Me too." We walked away from each other after this.  I walked to get food and called it a night. Next week I will definitely play this game again.   Without people, that is. They always let you down.

      I feel like I have to apologize for not posting anything in a long long time. I'm sorry. Take it or leave it.  What can I say? Life in F-L-A (say each letter; it sounds better) is pretty easy. I've only been bored once, and I had beer to help with that. Let me just sketch a normal day for ya.  Get up and go to work. Don't do a whole lot at work. Just sit around and try to remember all the interesting things I wanted to read about on the Internet. It never works when you have the Internet at your fingetips. Lunch = watching Sports Center or Conan. There's this guy who is a Cubs fan that everyone gives shit. I'd stand up and defend him, but it's just too easy to make fun of Cubs fans at the moment. Plus, I'm new. I'm going to use that excuse a lot. Today I asked some woman at the front desk if she needed help because the receptionist wasn't there. The woman was looking for someone, but I told her I didn't know the person because I'm new. So she says, "I guess I'll just wander around until I find a human. Not that you aren't human." And then at McDonald's there was this woman in a car in front of me with a child and a large dog. The dog was well behaved, but the child was barking like a dog. Women here are crazy! Except for the hott ass chick in the golf cart that I didn't bother to talk to. She just has to be sane!  It rains. Right...now! (4:03 pm, daily)  Anyway, so I get home and have two options: 1) eat dinner and start drinking, or B) start drinking then eat dinner.  This always involves sitting outside and watching and listening to our neighboors. These people are LOUD.  There are anywhere from 4 to 15 people living in this two bedroom apartment. They walk around in the morning double fisting bottles of Bud Light. There's a kid living with them (maybe 12 years old) who we saw walking around outside one day smoking a cigarette. One night during a thunderstorm one the "residents" asked us to give him a ride to the beer store so he wouldn't have to ride his bike. We declinded the offer even after he sweetened it by offering a couple beers. He ended up riding his bike. When he got back he yelled, "Thanks for the ride, guys." We ignored him, so he yelled again. Later, two guys carried him out of the apartment and drove him somewhere.  I haven't been to any bars yet, but I know where I want to start. There's this place called Curves. You know the kind of place that is. I'm thinking I'll have to pick a fight with my main B so I can get away from here long enough to check out the curves. Or I could go out with the salesman who sold me my truck. He offered to take me out when I went to finish the paperwork. He says, "Do you have a girlfriend?" I say, "Yes." He says, "You won't after you go out with me." The main B's dad is looking thoroughly appalled at this moment.  I lean back so I can see both of their faces at once: the salesman looks like he just stepped into the biggest pile of shit ever; the main B's dad is ready to kill someone. The paperwork was hassle free after that.  Anyway, I gotta go.

      Saturday.  Woke up, my head was pounding, stomach churning. After way too much resistance, I gave in and puked at about 1pm. From then on the day was as pretty as pony.  Saturday was my turn at the Indians game and, more importantly, free food. We ate a lot, stalked women, and watched the peanut guy totally drill people in the face with bags of peanuts. Then we walked around downtown, Mr. B pointed out all the gay buildings in Cleveland. I've never seen so many blatantly homosexual buildings. They were so flaming, you'd think the whole town would burn down. Bah-da-dum.   But seriously, downtown Cleveland is much cooler than I thought. And I could walk around with no shoes on without getting glass stuck in my feet.  That evening, Mr. B cooked a nice dinner while we sat and chatted with my would-be dinner date from the previous night. So, this girl was all like, "I'm cool" and I was like, "I'm bitter and awkward" and Chief was all, "I'm drunk" and Mr. B goes "Turn off Whitney Houston."   It was cool.  After dinner, I did my best to avoid any more awkward situations, which meant going to whatever room Chief and my dinner date weren't in. This was a success, in that I think it totally pissed off Chief.   So Mr. B and I were in high spirits after ditching the women. We hit the same bar. Things get a little hazy from here on.  Then came women. I remember this coincided with a Cure song I had requested--no, demanded-- that our DJ friend play. And I remember thinking that, because of this coincidence, it must be love.  Sadly, there was no loving to be had this night. But it wasn't due to a lack of Mr. B trying.  So here it is: we closed down the bars, stayed at an apartment (brother of the girl) until after 4am, talked her into coming to Mr. B's, realizing that I had no way of taking her home, explained to her that she had to go back home, and then, standing there in the headlights of a fucking mini-van, we exchanged email addresses - EMAIL ADDRESSES! So weird. But somehow, it fit. I like to look at weird moments like they were unintentional life-long goals. Like, somehow, I had spent my whole life working towards... what?...this? This whole group of people couldn't do any better than this? The best intentions of four people couldn't get me in bed with this girl just ONCE??  It should be so much easier to have sex with strangers.

      Ahh. Friday...  Yes, Mr. B beat me in golf. No, I don't want to talk about it. Yes, Chief was pissed about us being late. No, it wasn't the only time we pissed her off this weekend.  Anyways, I was left to fend for myself after my dinner date cancelled (I was set up by Chief, the girl was married... married women are so HOTT) and Mr. B and Chief went to the Indians game. Fortunately, my dinner date's husband was cool enough to fill in for her, and we had a nice time. We talked about 311, how it was wierd that I was set up with his wife, what 5 year span of the last 100 years we would most like to live through, and politics (it's SO in right now). And I tell you what, not many couples can make it through a dinner date after death threats from a beggar, so I think that says something about how fucking deep our relationship is.  So Mr. B finally came around with Chief and a couple other deadbeats, and we went to some bars. We had some drinks. For some reason my pace was faster than the rest of the crowd. I danced with Chief. I touched her ass. I wanted to make out. Hey, I'll admit it, I think Chief is attractive. But man, she looks REALLY good when you're drunk. Add to that the whole desperate thing, and that explains my drunken assault. Plus, you know, she's got the whole married thing (HOTT). I plan on doing this again.  Met a guy named Sean, and told him my name was Sean. We sort of hit it off. I sort of insisted we become instant best friends.  Later, I asked him to play the "suck-the-bottle-of-alcohol-that's-on-my-crotch" game that Mr. B and Chief won. The damn DJ stepped in though, but I think Sean was into it.   Speaking of the DJ... remember that scene in Swingers where Vince Vaughn is in the diner, standing on the table and screaming about how the place is trash, and how he is never coming back... but then shows up the very next morning like nothing ever happened? That was my relationship with the DJ that night. I hated him. I screamed at him. Spent more time doing this than I remember talking to Mr. B himself that night.   And then we showed up the very next day (same bar, same DJ) and acted like old friends. I even gave him my email address.  The last thing I remember about Friday night was forcing Chief to listen to the Pixies in their living room, while I was passing out on the floor. If I couldn't score with her, I could at least annoy the fuck out of her. Am I right, ladies? Where my ladies at? Nothing? Aah, whatever.  It was a great night. It had just the right mix of drunken debauchery and sexaul assualt, with that added spice that I like to call homosexuality.

      So, this weekend was awesome.&nbsp; Let me provide my recap for those who couldn't take part. Thursday - pick Mr. C's ass up from the Akron airport and drove back to Cleveland.&nbsp; Stopped and got some free chips and salsa in the bar area of a Chili's.&nbsp; Did anyone else know that you got free chips and salsa if you sat in the bar?&nbsp; It is 2 bucks if you sit anywhere else.&nbsp; This has got to be some&nbsp;kind of age discrimination case.&nbsp; Chili's, you've been warned, i'm coming after you for free chips and salsa thoughout the whole establishment.&nbsp; (Watch them make you pay for it no matter where you sit, bastards) Went to sleep after watching a movie, I don't remember what one, but i think it sucked.  Got up the next day and went golfing. This is where the fun (for me) begins. We played 18 at the place near my house.&nbsp; It isn't bad, not a lot of sand or water but plenty of trees to avoid. I shoot a 47 on the front and I'm feeling good.&nbsp; If i would have made a few putts here and there I would have been spectacular, but that was before the second nine.&nbsp;  The back started out like the first nine, in that I bogeyed the first hole after missing a chance at par.&nbsp; The 11th hole, a 365 yard par 4 was all mine biotch.&nbsp; I killed the drive and gave myself a second shot about 90 or so yards from the green right in the middle of the fairway.&nbsp; I pull out the pitching wedge and give a pretty good cut, then watched it roll off the back of the green.&nbsp; Oh well, I'll go up there and chip and putt for par.&nbsp; No problem. As I walk to find my ball, the guys on the tee in front of us come up and wonder who hit that ball.&nbsp; I thought I hit someone or something so i'm like, "What ball?"&nbsp; He's like that one.&nbsp;&nbsp; I said I did, not really knowing what was the deal yet and he told me "Nice Eagle," and shook my hand.&nbsp; I fucking dropped it in from 90 yards away and didn't even know it.&nbsp; That gave me a 2 on a par 4 and my first eagle.&nbsp; I could have stopped golfing there and been completely happy.&nbsp; But I finished the day with a blistering 41 on the back to give me an 88 for the day.&nbsp; Definitely my all time best.&nbsp; Oh yeah, Mr. C and I were playing for beer and basically he had to buy the 18 pack for me at the store since that is about how many holes I won, but who is keeping track?  Get home from golf and Chief is pissed.&nbsp; Apparently we were out there for like 5 and a half hours and we were going to be late to meet some other friends, which meant C had to go solo for awhile, since I had plans to go to an Indians Game.&nbsp; (It is much more complex than that but that is the basic story)&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. C&nbsp;hung out with one of my buddies while i stuffed my face at the game with free food and drink.&nbsp; Beer was really expensive so I couldn't get too drunk, but I did some damage.  After the game, we met up with C and went back to my side of town for the bars.&nbsp; Mr. C was wasted.&nbsp; I mean wasted.&nbsp; He was biting me and chief, hitting on her every chance he got, screaming "fuck" as loud as he could, assaulting DJ's that wouldn't play The Smiths, you name it.&nbsp; We hung out at one place before going to another because we got hungry at about 2.&nbsp; It turns out me and chief won a shot contest where the girl had to get on her knees and suck a shot out of a bottle from between the guys legs.&nbsp; It was funny, and now we get happy hour prices on everything no matter when we go, for life.&nbsp; Pretty sweet.&nbsp; I'll give more later, but Mr. C will have to post stuff from his perspective, just to give the full picture.&nbsp; Peace.

      Where in the world did that song come from?&nbsp; Is that something we created?&nbsp; After the sacrifice maybe?&nbsp; Either way, you should sing it to her in the car when we come and get you tonight.&nbsp;  Speaking of googling names.&nbsp; I tried Mr. A and found a&nbsp;bunch of emails he has sent to his bonehead cronies about&nbsp;responding to some questions he had about&nbsp;computer crap.&nbsp; I could read every single message that was sent.&nbsp; Something about plug-ins?&nbsp; I don't understand computers too well so it made no sense to me but&nbsp;there were a ton of them.&nbsp;   So&nbsp;I went golfing last night and totally lost 2 bucks playing skins with this dude I go to school with.&nbsp; I'm not too sure that I really lost that much but I don't care, if he's&nbsp;cheating i'll just kick&nbsp;his ass.&nbsp; We were stuck behind these women golfers (for anyone that reads this and is female but not michele wie or anaka sorenstam, take note).&nbsp; There were 2 groups of 4 ladies and they took about 14 strokes to get to the green.&nbsp; To make matters worse, the guys that were immediately behind them and right in front of us were waiting until the got completely off the green before they would hit.&nbsp; This was ridiculous because they sucked too.&nbsp; All day long we would wait about ten minutes and hit one about 4 feet from where they were standing after about 3 shots.&nbsp; Needless to say, it wasn't the best time&nbsp;to be&nbsp;a golfer.  I come into work this morning and there is no one here.&nbsp; I think I am by myself for this office with the hottie in the Financial Aid office who doesn't speak English.&nbsp; I'm think a scene from a Cinemax porn is about to happen.&nbsp; She just got her own office so I may have to slip inside for a one on one interview (if you know what i'm saying). Speaking of that last phrase, isn't if funny how lazy we are getting with the english language.&nbsp; Take the phrase, "do you know what i am saying."&nbsp; That is 8 syllabels.&nbsp; Here is the current version, "Nome Say'n."&nbsp; That is only 2.&nbsp; I defy you to find a longer phrase that has been shorten like that.&nbsp; In fact, I challenge you.&nbsp; Biottch  &nbsp;

      I just found this stuck in with a bunch of old notes:  A song, titled "Suck It, Chief"  When you have your sacrifice, I'll be the first in line.  Break my bones. Oh, break my bones  (break em if you can).  S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S (Su-Su-Suck it Chief!)  Deliver the mail In a million pieces.  Pick up the pieces. Oh, pick up the pieces (I don't know where they're at).  S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S (Su-Su-Suck it Chief!)

      Embarrassingly aware that I was being somewhat self-absorbed, I did a Google search on my name and here's what I found:   urlLink  a lost page   from my old website for Jami  and   urlLink  a website    with my name still listed as a DJ in Shreve at Purdue. Click the microphone, then DJ List (note Matt Earl's name below mine).

      The band (we are still, for the moment, Strawberry Buttplugs, but we kind of like Buttplug Birthday-- any thoughts?) practiced again tonight (just Katie and I), and it went really well. We have about three songs already, no lyrics yet and they still need work, but definitely a great start. But we play well together, and it's easy to try different things.  ::WARNING:: beginning of Mr. C opening up:: I can't help but be infatuated with this girl. She is adorable. Plus she plays drums, which is so cute it's disgusting, and even though she has an unhealthy obsession with Pearl Jam, I still can't help but get really excited about being around her. But to be honest, I DON'T want to do this to myself. I'd rather NOT get excited. I don't like waiting. I don't like wondering. It's a waste of fucking time. Someone help me get out of it. Someone bring me a prostitute. ::END OF WARNING::  Last night I went out with Craig and Dave, we started at Rattlesnake's downtown, ate and drank on the roof. I swear, I love being on roofs of buildings. Something about it makes you feel in control. Of what I have no idea. Anyways, we went to the Bukowski Tavern, then to Cambridge to see a few bands at the Middle East, and they sucked. Seeing these sucky bands made me 1) bored, and 2) want to get up there and do it myself.   My favorite part of the night though was getting back on the subway. Craig and Dave wanted to use my pass. So I screamed. And screamed. They still used it. I screamed some more. I thought this was hilarious. An MBTA worker came to see what the fuck was wrong. I stopped screaming and we jumped on the train. So then I started yelling about Chinese food.   At this point I was nearly incoherent...  So you must agree, DRINKING has it's BENEFITS!

      I'm done with the externship.&nbsp; Now I have to think of things to do like mr. C on the weekend.&nbsp; This is great.&nbsp; I'm thinking of turning into a professional drinker.&nbsp; I know, I know,&nbsp;mr. a already is one.&nbsp; He can identify 200 different beers just by their scent, and sometimes by their color.&nbsp; That is what I want to do with my life.&nbsp; It only took law school to figure this out.&nbsp; I'm going to start out by emailing all the small breweries in the world and work my way up from there.&nbsp; Maybe they can give me&nbsp; a job cleaning up spilled beer......with my mouth!!!&nbsp; I'd do it. As I'm typing this, I can't help but wonder if the font has changed on me.&nbsp; What he hell is this.&nbsp; I don't like it.&nbsp; Mr. C, change it back.&nbsp;  Oh yeah, who likes to spell words wrong as much as I do.&nbsp; They just look better.&nbsp; Everyone knows what you mean but if it is intentionally spelled wrong, they carry more emphasis.&nbsp; Maybe i'll start intentionally misspelling my name on resumes.&nbsp; Then when the say, that is quite an interesting way to spell your name.&nbsp; I can say; "dude, that's not how you spell it, I did that on purpose.&nbsp; I can see you don't understand, maybe Jones Day isn't the right place for me."&nbsp; That will leave him confused for days and most likely, because he will remember me, I'll get the job.&nbsp; What am I talking about?

      I finally have weekends off now, and I don't know what to do. Woke up around ten and couldn't relax. What do I do with all of this time? Even if I find something to do, it won't last all day, so then what will I do after that? I'm afraid that maybe too much free time isn't a good thing. I could end up sleeping every day until 2pm while looking at porn all day out of boredom.  But I was fine. Did some reading, or, I at least tried. I started Dostoevsky's "Notes from Underground", but couldn't deal with his yammering, or at least not today, so I switched to Oscar Wilde's "Picture of Dorian Gray"...but that put me to sleep. So as my mind was resisting any sight of words I decided to do nothing, and just lay in the sun. This was well worth it. Plus there were hot women everywhere.  Did some cleaning. Did some jogging. Put in a new  urlLink  search for a bassist . Saw Anchorman, and definitely recommend it, if only for the weatherman character (Steve Carell from the Daily Show). So many one-liners, Mr. B you will love this.

      I hate when DJ's play stupid songs that are impossible to dance to, unless you're some sexy Brazilian that was trained to dance to this complicated shit since birth. Just give me Footloose. Or any other cheesy/brilliant song from the 80's, for that matter. I don't want this stupid baseline with a stupid reggae-rap over the top. It sucks.  Hey, Mr. DJ, turn the music off, you fucking drive-me-cra-zy...

      I want to shit on someones face. It's ridiculous. I walked over two miles tonight because I couldn't keep track of time.  Ended up missing the subway home, ended up walking home, ended up singing songs to entertain myself while strange women gave me strange looks. I went to the Bukowski Tavern while it was closing, actually I ran to it, just to make it in time. But they already had last call. I went inside though. Looks like my sort of crowd: greasy hair and greasy smiles, as John Cougar used to say.  Went to get pizza on the walk home (the pizza that Mr. B eventually puked all over my walls, computer, etc.), and ordered a slice, but it was deformed. I told them to get me another. They gave me one, and said the other was on the house. At first I declined, then said okay, I'd take it, and gave it to the homeless man outside, along with a quarter. I felt better about myself, especially after a night of sloppy drinking and grabbing ass. The emotion was a fleeting one, however, and I feel like shit again.  At least I have the weekend off. Maybe I'll go to the beach.

      Dude, Rocks, The only thing I open up to is a stage of 30,000 screaming fans that want to touch it. I made that up.  It is a week from today and you and I can run amuck.  Hole, i hear you called last night but I don't know what happened.  Whatever, I'll talk to you some other time, I have a shit load of work to do tonight.   Sorry no postings lately, I've been dreaming of Lindsay Lohan.

      How's that for a band name? Sure, it's stolen (from the first line of  Aeroplane Over the Sea), but what isn't? We all suck too much to be original anymore. That goes for you, too, Ghandi. Plus, the only other name we have at this point is Strawberry Buttplugs. That's actually stuck for a few weeks now (no pun intended). Just need to run it by Katie (drummer), and somehow I don't think she'll go for it.  Speaking of the band, Katie and I practiced last night at a place called JamSpot. They have rooms with all the equipment needed, you pay by the hour. It's awesome. I played some pretty cool guitars and sounded pretty mean with some badass distortion for awhile. Katie actually thinks I'm good. I like her.  We went for a couple of beers at the Baseball Tavern afterwards and sat ignoring the All Star game talking about mostly our parents and marriage (I think the other guys at the bar wanted to kick my ass). Managed to get through without talking about my failed attempt. Sometimes it's good to open up to strangers about really personal things. You can't get in trouble that way.

      I couldn't be more proud of myself: today was my final day at the hotel. I actually feel better about getting out of the hotel than I did about finishing college. I feel like I accomplished something.  So now that it's done, I'll let you in on a secret. When visiting a hotel, complain as much as possible, and as often as possible (without getting kicked out). Two things will happen: 1) Your name will be known by all the workers in guest services. The front desk, the managers, even housekeeping, will be at their best for you. 2) You WILL get what you want. Whether it is an upgrade in a room, or a free breakfast, or a round of drinks, or free parking, if you complain enough, they will give you something for free. And it's all because they want you to shut up.  It's just like when some parent drags their kid through a store, and the kid won't stop screaming until the mom or dad folds and gets the little fucker what it wants.  And so this is the life for someone working in hospitality. Guests get to cry like kids, stomp around kicking and screaming until they get $5 off their room bill. That's why I was never that good at it. For me it was the principle of it; you aren't getting it because you're acting like a fucking fool. Just because you thought you were right, that still doesn't make you right. Well, it was that, plus the fact that I don't like people.

      So I went out last night with my main b. We met this guy and his wife and started talking about whatever we were talking about. I think there was a lot of religion, science, politics, school bashing, region-of-the-country bashing, etc. The part I remember most is that this guy 1) has heard of Wilco; 2) likes Wilco; and 3) actually knows who The Sound of Urchin is (no luck with Neutral Milk Hotel). At this point we went up to the bar and he bought us some tequila shots. These weren't snakebites or anything. Straight tequila, no chaser (except beer). His thoughts on chasers and salt 'n' lime tricks is that they are the equivalent of training wheels. I agree. Take it like a man. Any time we go out from now on, alone or together, we should make a point of ridiculing anyone who takes a wussie shot. Do you want me to hold your hand while you take that? Did you leave your purse in the car? Do you really suck that much? These are all appropriate things to say to a complete stranger.  Oh, yeah. Last weekend I pissed off a bouncer and he wouldn't let me in. Whiney bitch.

      Yeah, I was just thinking before I logged on how it would be a great idea to be a little less specific about things.  The last thing I need is someone using this lame stuff against me in the future.  I don't think the general public would really understand any of this.  From now on, I will refer to you guys as Clive (instead of I threwsomerocks) and bhole.  These names are of course subject to change and let me know if you don't like them.  I'm also going to go back and delete any names from my previous posts to be on the safe side.  So, I totally just got busted by one of the clerks for leaving work like 2 hours early.  The judge went home and when he is gone there is nothing else to do.  I'm not sticking around for nothing.  However, as I make my way down the stairs, I totally go right by her and she asks, "Are you going home?"  Uh, yeah, what the hell else am I doing taking the stairs to avoid people.  Hopefully she realizes that I'm supposed to be part time anyway.  Hopefully I don't get the boot tomorrow morning.  By the way, that girl is way cuter than Avril Lavegne.  Good work.  I'm heading to an Indians game with the other workers tomorrow.  We plan on going to a bar before hand.  I think then would be a good time to get completely wasted and freak out the squares.  I'll have to keep you posted on how that goes cause it may get ugly.  Did i mention i am the shit at golf.  I got a 14 on the first 2 holes and somehow managed to end with a 47.  when is the last time you fuckers played some golf.  Clive, when you come out or come back to Cleveland, you should bring your clubs or something.  Chief has some but they are female.    This party is great, good friends, good food, good brew, man this is awesome.  I'm gonna go pick a fight.

      I love  urlLink  this   urlLink  girl    urlLink  here   (3 pictures). She's sexy. She's adorable... I don't know her. But does that mean I cannot love her? No.  Today a conversation went from how Boston is one of the safest cities in America to how great Viagra can be for sex. This happened all within about three minutes. The connection between the two escapes me now. Anyways, someone I know, about 23 years old, used Viagra, just for joke. Apparently there is a noticeable difference in the girl's reaction (she didn't know he took it).  Damnit, isn't she cute?

      I love our little corner of the internet. So cozy. Sometimes I wonder if anyone comes and violates our unknown regions. I wish they would leave a comment.  By the way, we should make this site more anonymous. Maybe just stop using our names? The archives will still be there, but if they are that determined, they can find out. Just in case, you know?  Just found out that  urlLink  Alf has a talk show special   July 7th on TV Land, with the immortal Ed McMahon as co-host. Remember on old episodes of Alf when he dreamed he was Johnny Carson? They used to have Ed on those. And all these years later, Alf's dream comes true. It was our dream too, Alf. It was our dream, too.  I didn't know Skittles was still around. I actually haven't had a real conversation with her in months, so while it's suprising to hear that she is dating Skittles, at the same time, it's not that suprising. But, it is definitely odd. They'll be married in less than a year. Who wants to take bets?

      I think the picture of the Basic Instinct cover was by far the best. So it is already Tuesday. When did that happen? The fireworks here were supposed to be pretty cool but I didn't go. I was at home watching some James Bond when that went down. Bond was much cooler and i'll even say more explosive than fireworks downtown. I have to agree with C that smaller towns get more out of the fireworks going off at the little league fields. That shit is the bomb. I especially like how the community rallys together and each family brings a delectable treat containing chlorophyll green so that the new families will be rid of their stinking blood. (oh elliot) Today this attorney came into the chambers and I almost got up to proposition her while chief is out of town. I figured the Judge wouldn't like that type of thing, especially since now he knows my name. Needless to say, the entire hour long settlement negotiation was consumed with thoughts of skull fucking. Does anyone else use the term skull fuck as often and meaningfully as we do?  I doubt it. C, i'm pumped about you coming out to Cleveland. I've started counting down the days to christmas but it is tough since i don't know when you are coming for sure. On an awkward note: I saw C's ex this weekend and she was talking about wanting to come up sometime and she was going to bring Skittles Mike. I wanted to tell her that I'd probably rig the front porch with landmines if that were to happen but I restrained myself. Instead, I told her that I would have to tear off his nipples and feed them to the bums that ride the Train in the morning. not really, but i know a guy. So, you need to start making arrangements to come to the Pig Roast next year with me right now. I don't want these plans to fall through. For Aaron, the pig roast was over the weekend and some friends of mine from school and all their high school friends have this giant outdoor festival. This year there were 35 kegs, 11 different animals cooking at some point throughout the night and day, 250 people, and plenty of sex and substance abuse. Not to mention a pool and games called Cornhole. (figure that shit out) All of this takes place in the middle of nowhere in Logan Ohio at a Farm House that is abandoned the remaining 362 days of the year. Needless to say, I had a good time and I was only there for 1 night. Next year will be a marathon, i'm talking Boston Marathon. when I say that, I mean the time we got up at 8 and drank till 2:30 and then ate pizza till 4 and then I blew chunks some time before clint woke up which narrowly avoided Nate's wrath. I love it, i'm out.

      I just finished watching some Adult Swim, and I've got to say that Aqua Teen Hunger Force has to be one of my all time favorites. I've only seen two episodes, but this was even more strange than the first. And Harvey Birdman was hilarious. The bear on that show kills me.  Today I was walking down Jersey Street and came to the Boylston intersection, and standing in one spot, I could see the Goodyear blimp, a low-flying helicopter, about ten people carrying paddles (for a boat), and a black albino (At least I think she was black; she had black kids). Anyways, I'm not saying all of these things are strange, it was just strange to see all of these things happening around me all at once. It's one of those moments where everything is normal, then you take ten more steps and you feel like you've entered some parallel universe. I just felt strange and out of place, or maybe I felt I was in just the right place. I can't tell.  I wasn't feeling this year's 4th. It seemed like a normal day, but with fireworks. From what I've seen, I think this holiday fits smaller towns much better. You just don't get that feeling that you're connected to something in the city. It's only a holiday out of routine. I was telling someone about Lebanon's 4th of July, and how after the parade you basically walk in and out of people's houses you barely know, eating their food, because for one day at least, it becomes a real community. She said it sounded weird. Then I told her about our disco parade. She seemed uninterested.   What the fuck??

      Jeff came up Friday night. We were at Jake's with a bunch of people, and somehow Jeff and I got to talking about the time at his place when we saw the pigs fucking. Later, Darren asked Jeff what kind of farm he lived on. I immediately yelled, "A pig fucking farm!" Then I slapped Jeff on the leg and asked him if he wanted to go to the bathroom with me. The two girls next to him heard all of this, and when we came back they were gone.

      So it's official, I am leaving the hotel for full days at the magazine. It's sad, in a way, but then I check one more person in and realize that another small piece of me has died. Plus, they're starting up with the "Cut your hair" routine again. Once was funny. But this time I wish they'd see that it's just not funny anymore, and I'm not fucking cutting it.  Went boozing last night and let loose. We actually picked up a group of Australian girls that were semi-cute. I danced. I drank. I somehow knew a lot of lyrics to that Outkast song about thinking you're shit don't stank. I remember one girl dancing with me, and I must have used too much hands, cause it didn't last long. But that was more action than I've had for awhile, so that was nice.  Jeff and Chris Jones called while I was out, they were at Johny's in Lebanon. Chrisann was there too. Here's how Jeff explained his coming into Johny's:   (Jeff sits down at table with Chris Jones.) Jeff: Hey Chris. Wait, is that Chrisann??? Chris Jones: Yep. Let's call Clint.  I don't know why but I think thats hilarious. But the good news is that she is NOT engaged, but has a boyfriend. God this is pathetic. True story: I once told Jami that no matter how much I loved her, or how long we were together, I would always have a thing for Chrisann Swanson. It didn't seem like a bad thing to say, I was just being honest. I had no idea that, years later, Jami would be gone, yet this strange obsession for a girl I hardly know would still be around. Oh well. It will end someday, right?

      I cannot make this stuff up. The dumb girl that plays tennis I work with is unbelievable. Today, we started talking about how some of us hate to mow the lawn and others don't mind it. Jenny starts telling us that she will mow our lawns for us. We said, "If you want to do it so bad why don't you just mow your own lawn?" Her reply, "We don't cut our grass. But somehow it stays pretty short. I don't think we mow our lawn." You can't make this up, why would you?  She has no idea how her grass has been mowed for the past 23 years. She's never seen her dad do it, she's never seen anyone else do it. She will admit that she has heard a lawnmower going outside of her house but can't confirm that it was someone mowing her lawn. As far as she knows, she lives on astroturf. (not that she knows what that is)  It was about this time that I fell in love with this girl. How can she be so dumb yet succeed in life? She's applying to transfer to the Georgetown Law School. No way in hell should a person like that be eligible for that school, yet she will probably be accepted. Unbelievable.  There was another thing that was completely insane that she said today.  Let me think what it was.  Oh yeah. We were walking back to work from lunch 2 days ago and we were outside at a different building downtown. We are about 3 blocks away and you could see the 21 story courthouse right in front of us. We walked a total of 5 minutes to another building. She looks up at the building we work in every day this summer, points, and asks, "What building is that, that looks pretty cool." True story. I think skull fucking is in her near future and C is the man to give it to her when he visits. I love it. So basically I have her phone number now and I have invited her to hang out with me while chief is gone. I can only imagine how good my evenings will be filled with her mindless rambling. I'm out.

      I'm going to be on vacation for the next week so you'll bitches need to make do without me.  Mr. A, I swear I am not avoiding your calls or anything, but i am a lazy forgetful bitch and I intend to call back.  Perhaps while i'm sitting in the car on the way to WV, but I would have to remember, damn it.  C, I'm still pissed that you cheated on me with Dan after one night.  Did you get an email from his sister yet?  Ha ha ha, baby jesus jokes?  Is the minivan driver divorced yet?  Where are my keys?    Jester, i'm going to be thinking of you when I'm bangin around the river and I want to give up because the rapids are so brutal or when the switchbacks seem endless.  This will probably result in an erection and an awkward situation with the family all around.  But I will continue my journey with the lesson you taught me in mind - don't eat the soggy biscuit.   You know, because the water will have soaked everything in the raft and it'll taste nasty, WHAT?  I wonder if I told my work that I wasn't returning for a week and a half?  They don't care.  A person from the black eyed peas could do my job and no one would know a difference in quality.  I'm naked right now, again thinking of Jester.

      So, no Modest Mouse concert for me this weekend. Dave waited until TODAY to get tickets, two days before the fucking concert. Obviously, it's sold out. So I think we're going to plan B...  the Cure and Interpol. Not bad at all.  So, right now I just want to take a moment and address a life long problem of mine.  Stalking.  It kind of just happened. One minute things are normal, the next I'm on the wrong subway line and 20 minutes past my stop, following some random girl.  "I'll talk to her," I think. "Just wait for your chance." But there isn't a chance. And if there was, I couldn't do anything about it. It's around then that I start questioning myself, and start to get paranoid. I see someone looking at me and I think, "They know. They all know." I ended up riding the damn subway to it's last stop. I couldn't bring myself to follow her.  It's that decision that makes me feel okay about the whole thing. I can play the game, but I know when something starts to be "wrong."  Writing "Abby Christmas" across from her locker was funny. Acting as a timer during a swim meet was funny. Looking up her class schedule (thanks A) and watching her from the hallway was fucking hilarious. Actually following her home would have been "wrong."   And in college. When we watched the lesbians through their window across the street, that was funny. Getting out binochulars would have been wrong. Wait- we did that. Getting caught would have been wrong. Oh shit, we did that too. Nevermind, that's a bad example.  But here's the deal. My mind likes to believe that fairly irrelevant acts can somehow reveal something about a person's true character. And so, along this line of thinking, I've decided that if I ever get married it will be based on whether or not she'll play the stalking game with me.   That, and her name has to be Charlie.

      Dude, i remember reading this thing on espn.com and it mentioned the wife of one of the pitchers for the Pirates. Apparently she was smoking hot and I have confirmed that she is. Check  urlLink her  out. Be sure to check out one of her links. It is worth the 1 minute of your day to see her, trust me. However, there are quite a few pictures that I am wondering if she thinks this looks good to other people or if she had this shit in her closet and pictures to burn. Keep it real

      I have to agree with A, I was thinking all of the same things.  Not completely aweful for you as a refreshing drink (its about the same as fruit juice, w/o the healthy fruit juice crap), and it doesn't have that ultra sugar taste that is way over the top.  It is a good balance.  I think they should abandon the regular cola and use this recipe as their base cola.   Then again, sooner or later I plan on owning a potato farm and making potato chips that taste like whatever you want them to taste like.  If you want steak, grab a steak chip.  You want General Tsao's chicken, you got it.  You want C2 in a potato chip, its fucking done.  This new meal is perfect for those that like the taste of other foods, but enjoy the simplicity of grabbing a potato chip.  (take for instance, ME)  Plus they will be baked (how else do you get all those flavors in a chip?), so they won't be really bad for you.

      So where was I?  Oh yeah, we are at a bar on Friday night and C is yelling and screaming and biting me and Chief and so on and then there is the walk home and more yelling and screaming and finally getting back to my place where C wants to pump up the stereo with the Pixies.  Too bad my landlord lives up stairs or I'm down with that, but not this time.  Besides, the glassy look in C's eyes meant that he wasn't going to be awake long enough for the chorus of the 2nd song.  Woke up on Saturday at like 10:30 and felt great.  Somehow, I either feel like a million bucks or i'm a complete POS.  I'm wanting to get to the Indians game early so that we can eat for about 4 hours straight.  I told C that we would be leaving by 11:30 but that was about the time he sat up from the couch.  C finally pukes at 1 and we leave.  The game was good, the food was great, but there wasn't any slushies that we could suck down.  That ruined the afternoon.  So we get back and then I have to cook for Chief her friend and C.  I wasn't hungry so they did the eating (probably because I ate 10 pounds of food at the game).  C did a good job of not making any friends of the new chick and we effectively alienated ourselves from them.  We downed an 18 pack (not of Corona you freaks) and went back to the bar that we got our lifetime pass from.  The DJ was there again and instead of yelling at him, C made him his best friend and they talked and exchanged email addresses.  It was weird.  It got weirder when these girls got up and danced with C and I (we were the only 2 dancing to the Cure).  One girl wanted C's nuts, so I had to play wingman with her 26 year old, married, 3 kids friend and her Brother Dan.   Wingman might be my favorite thing to do while out with people.  I'm off the market but it gives me an excuse to peruse and talk with other fly honeys all the while fooling myself into thinking this chick wants me.  (But this chick with the kids and husband did want me, i swear)  We close out the bar and somehow end up at Dan's place with the girls, playing Battle of the Sexes.  That lasted for about 3 minutes when I start rolling around on their floor.  I am completely wasted by this point.  The room is spinning, i've thrown my wallet behind his couch (or someone did), and I think I started just staring at people and asking where the pisser was.  Overall, Dan was the coolest dude we've ever met.  I'm in love with him, but not more than C is. The only visual I can give you is, we love Dan more than A wants to have Sex with Charlie.  I mean, that is big time.  At about 4:30, the girls are leaving and I managed to give C one last shot at action.  However, when we finally got to my place,  we had no way of getting her home and then that led to the awkward email exchange in the minivan headlights.  (she drove a minivan)  I went to bed but this was after pondering, "will i blow chuncks" on the back porch.  I decided I wouldn't and if i did it would have to be in bed.   Anyway, I woke up on Sunday, realizing that I don't have my keys, thank god the door was unlocked.  I started piecing together the night and eventually remembered Dan's last name because his dad is a Judge near Cleavage (new name for Cleveland).   I looked in the phone book and there is only one Dan with that name, and sure enough, he is still asleep.  I felt really awkward, but I had to get my keys back.  "Dude, this is B, the guy that hung out with you last night.  Umm, do you have my keys?"  It was weird, but not half as weird as going to pick them up from his place.  I felt like I had just had a one night stand and left my purse at his house with all my credit cards and shit.  I now know what the walk of shame feels like.   It was this extremely weird night and morning with some of the coolest people on earth that concluded the weekend and I had to drive C to meet his parents.  Kind of anti climactic, but it worked.  Hopefully I see Dan out again one night and we can rekindle the flame.

      I tried the new Coke C2 last week. I'm having another one right now. I kind of like it. It tastes better than regular Coke, has half of whatever it is people think is bad right now, and it isn't sickeningly sweet. Nice. Fluffy.  A bunch of us were watching Conan today at lunch. It was hilarious even though it was a rerun. He was going around to experts in antique cars and trying to convince them that his '92 Taurus was worth a lot of money. He would demonstrate things like the cup holder or the radio. He would sing at the top of his lungs for an entire song while this stuck up prick is sitting next to him not knowing what to do. He ended up giving the car to Brad Pitt, but only after he (Conan) stripped down to his boxers and tried on some armor and a skirt. Wow. Scratchy.  That's all I have to say right now.
