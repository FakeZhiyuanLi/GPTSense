      I live in a dream cos the dream never happens in real life.  

"It hurt like a rusty spear tearing through her chest, its jagged edges ripping at her flesh, decemating muscle and bone in its path.  She gasped, fighting for even one breath against this invisible enemy but just wanting to give in to the pain.  How could one person not say anything and manage to destroy her whole world with a glance?"

      I feel eyes on me but no words are spoken, 
no smiles explained,
just looks that I cannot fathom.
He glances at me with his big blue eyes,
there's a message behind them
but he never tries.
I hate him, I want him, 
somehow he might feel the same
I'll never shed a tear for him
but often I weep with shame.
How can I blame him for being a boy,
When It's with my own fears and actions
that my feelings toy.

      I can't get him off my mind,
I think about that evening all the time.
It's driving me crazy,
It's sending me nuts,
I don't want him to be my all
But a hint of affection and down I fall.

      "The warm water splashed down, drenching her hair and skin, Sian could still taste the hot salty tears cascading down her face.  Closing her eyes, she breathed deep.  Waiting for the tears and blood to wash away.  The cuts on her wrists stung as she held them up to the spray; cleansed through the pain.  She would be reborn..."

      This black hole is an abyss,
sucking me in,
sucking me dry.
I feel out of control,
letting the fates rule me
which ultimately means
my life becomes empty.
watching time pass me by
I'm not making the most of things
my eyes dry, I silently cry

      I dreamt a dream,
but what does it mean?
I have an urge to run and hide,
to keep myself protected deep down inside.
I should risk everything,
for a brief time when my heart could sing.
but I'm scared, paralysed by fear
and everyday the end gets far too near.

      we sat there like little kids,
our legs dangling through the railings high above,
and the silence was rich and beautiful,
but full of clarity.
no need for words or movement,
we were there.
our minds aware of one another,
but free to follow their own journey.
i could bare my soul to you
strong, soft, silent and observant,
thinking a million things at once,
but still so slow.

      while I'm sitting hoping and praying that this one person will notice me, he's probably doing the same thing about someone else, who is also doing the same thing over yet another person...it's a tragic circle of bitter irony.  And to make things worse everyone knows everyone else.  Is this a circle of friends or just a circle of pain?

      Your head laid on my breast
and your naked body
pressed against mine.
Our breathing slowed,
we caught ourselves.
You make me feel beautiful.
There's a silent connection
but I don't understand
when you clasp your fingers around my hand
What does it mean?

      I didn't realise I'd miss you so much
we were only friends
but I felt our souls touch.
Radiant beauty shines out of your heart,
you're a special man
and it's a shame to part.

I'll think of you when I'm far too old,
you have so much potential
burning bright, when I'm dead and cold.
It was only brief,
but I saw that you're gifted
and I'll leave you now,
my heavy soul lifted.

      Now that it's too late,
I can't get you out of my head.
It's one of those things I hate,
like words I almost said.
I see your face in my sleep,
What do you really feel
way down deep?
I want to ask, I have to deal.
Too scared too know,
frustration and fear,
but if I finf the courage,
will you even hear?

      well it's done, i've paid and received the tickets.  I am officially going to knoxville for two weeks in september.  okay so my mum still doesn't know yet, but I got a job this week and i start on monday, so i thought i'd break the news to her in about a week.  my sister and i have made a pact.  I'll tell my mum over the phone and she'll deal with it for me, try and soften things.  she has a way with mum, that i just don't have, i.e. she tends to be a spoilt brat who always gets her way.  but i love her, and as a thanks i'll bring her back 200 cigarettes without making her pay for them.  she's broke, i'm nearly there (although not so bad off now cos my overdraft went up) and mum keeps saying that her bank account is nearly empty and she might have to borrow some money from my savings.  that is the main reason she's gonna have a fit, it'll just top it off that i'll be in america (again) for my gran's birthday.  oh well. I'm actually scared of telling her. hmmm.
well on to happy thoughts.
i will arrive in knoxville at 7.10pm on thursday 9th september and leave at 11am thursday 23rd sept.  so if anyone wants to offer me a place to stay during this time i'd be very greatful, also a ride to and from the airport would be very much appreciated and probably rewarded some how, depending on who it is ;-) 
I've promised heather that i's stay with her, she seemed really excited and told me i had to spend the most time with her.  she's really sweet, however i fully intend to catch up with the smoking crew and will probably crash on christine's couch for a few nights to make that easier.  I love having different groups of friends that have nothing to do with each other, but sometimes it makes it difficult especially during visits.  I want to see everyone but i don't want to offend anyone.  I really cannot wait.  btw this is the time to ask me if you want anything from england!  I wish i had more money i really wanna buy lots of presents.
although as usual i'm nervous as well as excited.  I hope everything is the same but i have to prepare for the possibility of an anticlimax.  i had such an incredible time especially in that last week that how could anything really compare.  also i just wonder if people will be different with me now, they've had time to think and talk and also that rather large faux pas a few weeks ago definately has potential to put a spanner in the works.
so people, that means especially, Christine, Eli, Warren, Sander, Heather, Mike, Dan, Charlene, Anne-Marie, Kelly, Samar etc etc, you better make sure you have some free time.(if i left anyone out, i apologise and didn't mean it)
It'll be very cool because everyone (except Warren, awww) will finally be 21 and we could actually go out places which could be very exciting. ahhh i want to jump up and down ands shout it from the rooftops, it almost feels like going home.  I feel as though part of me has been left in knoxville (part of me has always been in america), but now that feeling is even stronger. it's just the way things are, the way i feel.

      well the other day me and my mum were walking down the street and out of the blue (bearing in mind i've been back for over a month) she asks me if i'd been seeing anyone in america and deducts that i am no longer a virgin!  conversation goes like this

mum: so did you have a boyfriend in tennessee, or go out with anyone? 

(wow where the hell did that come from)

Me: ermmm, not really.  there was some guy who i made out with occassionally, but that's it, we didn't "go out", just friends  (please don't ask any questions, please)

Mum: so my little girl's not a virgin anymore 

(um okay, big leap but true in a round about way)

me: um no.  (lack of virginity confirmed now please change the subject, i refuse to talk about this with my mother)

end of conversation

so my mum deduces that "making out" means having sex, and i guess she's not entirely wrong.  I thought I'd just let her believe i was de-flowered by some yank.  It's a whole lot easier than explaining the truth.  I mean what would i say.."hey mum, I was 15 and he was 26, oh yeah you know him"  somehow I don't think that would go down to well.
it's funny what my mum is cool about and what she's not, it can seem to be completely contradictory.

      well you know what, I think i just got most definately ignored, great, way to make a girl feel good.  I don't even want you to like me (i mean it would be nice but who gives a fuck right?).  So i'm wondering if i should see this as some backfiring of my fuckup or whether it's entirely separate and therefore worse.  i don't need some complicated blah, but a hey would be nice, show that i didn't completely waste my time.  but maybe i just am that much of a loser.

      all i seem to be doing these days is apologise.  and kate i'm sorry for freaking you out, that was a really daft idea fueled by alcohol and stupidity.  it was a selfish and weak thing for me to try and do.  thanks for caring for me.  so now after an hours sleep i'm off to the dentist, then i think i'll make an appointment to see the doctor.
i feel like crap and when i woke up my mouth tasted like arse...nice.

      this wasn't really fair.

CENSORED (1)  i'm an idiot, a stupid fucking, childish idiot.  why have i done this to myself and others?  why?  i sometimes wonder if i have any working braincells in the lump of shit that sits on my shoulders.  I don't think I'm ever going to be able to make up for this, infinite apologies will never be enough and i've ruined everything. EVERYTHING!!!!!! someone please shot me!  god, i hate myself, i truely despise what i am. how did i become this...thing? this monster?  how could i do that to someone I care about?  stupid mistakes always backfire up my arse and explode out the top of my head. 
not only have i ruined things with one person I care about but probably with everyone.  Even those i might love.  and who could blame them really if they never want to have anything to do with me again.  CENSORED (2)

1. I should have left this out in the first place, i was feeling despondant.  i should have more faith in people.

      after reading your away message earlier i wrote this for you.  it may be a rather crap, but hey, I can but try.

you look like a man,
but sometimes in your eyes
i see where a little boy hides.
you feel like a man
strong arms to embrace
but a silent shiver runs down your arm.
i want to hold you tight 
and keep you safe from harm.

a man and a child
wrapped up in one.
i worry about you
now that i'm gone.
be happy sweet boy
you are not alone
the strength in your soul
has already shown.

yeah, it's pretty bad, sorry.  Also I hope it doesn't offend you in anyway and hope all is well and you take care of yourself. x you can talk/email/text etc anytime and i'll be there for you.  do you think i'm a psycho now? ;-)

      well turns out my mum wasn't so bothered about the computer, she was more pissed that I hadn't done the vacuuming.  also, this dude looked at my laptop today and found out what was wrong with it.  no i wasn't going mad, i hadn't change the password, the computer wouldn't register it because the keyboard's fucked and needs replacing.  hopefully he's gonna get it done for free for me....yay.
thank god I'm moving to canterbury on thursday, because my mum was really starting to piss me off.  She's getting on my case about stuff.  I haven't told her about my plan to go back out to knoxville, but, she's lettingmy sister go on holiday with a friend and is even lending her 100 quid to do it, so she can't complain if i pay for my self....i keep forgetting that i'm a grown woman now, so does she.  she still treats me like a kid sometimes, a lot of times.

      well my mum's back, so far so good but i haven't informed her of all the mishaps that occurred in her absence.  let's see, oh yeah, well, i broke my glasses (well technically Alex broke them by elbowing me in the face), we accidentally dyed my mum's white underwear blue, i installed os x panther on the imac and it erased everything, and i mean everything (i haven't told her yet, but all her accounts are gone, she is going to kick my arse.  in response I plan on teaching her how to save shit on the zip drive)  also we almost killed her plants by forgetting to water them.  it's probably lucky that I'm moving out on thursday, i need to avoid the wrath of my mother.  she's only a little woman but she can be damn scary at times!

      so just out of curiosity I was looking at flights back to america on the internet.  It looks almost possible.  If i want to fly direct to knoxville it will cost me about 400 pounds, but if i'm willing to shlep around I can get to new york for under 200, then i could just get on a bus for about $150.  hmm me thinks I'd rather pay extra for comfort and quickness.  it would be so easy to jsut bung it on the credit card.  if i could stay with people i wouldn't have to worry about paying for accomodation so esp if i get a job this summer i can just about afford it.  i have a high credit limit and the government just gave me some money.  Am i being stupid, is september too soon to go back?  maybe i should wait till later, but sept is such a convenient time of year.  i won't have nay classes yet, all my friends will have just started, but hopefully won't have too much work, it's football season and the weather is still fantastic. Also is it Eli's 21st around then sometime?

      so i passed the fuck out last night.  we were all watching movies in my room, and I just couldn't hack it.  it was a combination of hungover, being inside all day, being stoned and dehydrated, plus alex broke my glasses at the dinner party on friday so i've been wearing my old ones which are totally the wrong prescription, it really didn't help my head to have eye strain. ugh.
I looked up at my clock when they left and it was 4am.  this bad sleeping pattern i've slipped back into has really got to stop.  which it probably will because my mum gets back tonight.  we did a lot of tidying yesterday, really just got to finish doing laundry and vacuum the carpets and we'll be good to go.
i woulda slept for longer today but the damn neighbours decided that drilling and basically using any power tools that have the ability to sound like they're pounding into your head, would be a good idea.  I'd totally forgotten that early sunday mornings was when they always choose to do this.
i can't wait to move down to canterbury.  I'm gonna miss my friends terribly but i'll have freedom down there and hopefully a job.  I kind of feel smothered here.

      i go down there in the morning sun,
to meet my friends and have some fun.
we take a dip in the rising waves
and look for birds' eggs in the darkened caves.
as the sun gets higher
the sand turns to gold
and we look ihn the shops 
at the things that are sold.
when the sky gets dark
we all go home
and wait for tomorrow
when again we'll roame.

      i'm so frustrated
what do i do?
emotions are taking over
i don't understand myself
what do i want?
there's so much underneath
just waiting to brim over
who am I?
i'm not this shell 
this body that i hate
my heart thumps so violently
beating against a cage of ribs
impatient to be free
something's got to give
to let me be me.

i can see your pain
but i can't relieve it
i caused it
and there's no going back
i can't say it aloud
because if i do 
you'll know
that i know
i want to hug you
to hold you tight
but i know you'd push me away
you should
because it's my fault
oh god,

you've caused me so much pain
why did I bother?
you won't even talk

like rivers of salt

with the heat fo fever

farther and farther
deeper and deeper
leaving me confused
it's all out of my control.

      i wish i could die
there's no point being alive
all i do is cry
it hurts deep inside
my chest feels tight
i can't breath
i can't be bothered to fight
every morning i wake up
just to face another day
i dread when morning comes
will it ever be okay?
i can't sleep at night
my brain never stops
i hate myself
i hate my life
the problem with living is
it just gets so hard
i can't see a solution
my only comfort is food
but all it brings is pain
it's all the same
over and over again
i'm so ugly
inside and out
am i really here
or is it one long nightmare?
i'm stuck
i cut myself and it hurts
but i feel no pain
i'd kill myself
if i had the guts
life isn't a game
i want to play
if only everything
would just be okay

      the way you look at me,
there's something in your eyes.
I know it can never be,
you never hear my longing sighs.

you belong to another,
I have to see it everyday.
Your hands entwined together,
I wish I could look the other way.

the torment and pain in my heart
sometimes I can't bear to live
it's tearing me apart,
will there be no reprieve?

everytime she hurts you,
I can't help but care.
I can feel my chest crack in two,
but I could never break the love you share.

but when you look at me
with that way you do
I know it could never be
even if you feel it too.

I see your lips close to mine
just inches between our faces
your brown eyes shine
I feel it as your pulse races.

      Do you ever wake up and realise that you're nothing?  I do.  I hurt and sometimes I don't know why.  My chest constricts and my throat burns.
I'm not special, I'm not good, I'm not even bad, I'm a misnomer, an afterthought of life.
Sometimes I feel nothing, empty, if nobody can see anything in me then surely it must be true.  A waste of space, a large, gaping black hole.
I'm here alone.  I seem unable to fix my life.  I'm an idiot, a dumb little fuck full of pathetic fantasies.  No one sees the scars even when they are physical, scratches along my arms, perhaps they just choose to ignore in general.  I feel I could kill myself, up here in my room and not a soul would notice or care.

      I crave your exquisite embrace, constantly, every night, in fevered dreams of gentle caresses and sweet breath over soft skin.  Even the tiniest, feathery kiss would satisfy my want.  This perfect love for you deep in my heart, searching for a whisper of returned emotions.  the need to hear that even the absence of beauty can not hold back the love that I deserve.  That even though unlike me, she is the picture of a goddess, the fiery passion hidden in the depths of my soul could ignite a response in you.  Until then I remain an empty vessel, waiting and enduring agony every night, ready to be eased and healed from an ache so violently heavy, that burns here in my breast.

hold me up, I'm tired
my body aches for comfort
I depend on your soul
through all my life

your body is a boulder
to stop me sprawling
on the cold hard floor
your embrace lifts me into warmth
where my mind will soar

      shattered teardrops
beyond repair
sting my eyes
like razor sharp needles
a million teardrops 
fill a chasm of despair

a broken reflection 
of a broken self
splintered glass
razor edges
that cut my life
to painful shreds

shattered teardrops
crystal shards
prick my skin
like crimson velvet
rivers of blood
the emptyness within

      hey i found some more poems etc that i wrote years ago.  I've decided that everything even the crappest of the crap will go online for preservation.  Somewhere in cyberspace they might be safe.  Recently my old laptop died and I had bits on there that weren't saved to floppies and I lost it all.  That can't happen again.

      well maybe it's not so satisfying to read other peoples blogs.  Unfortuanately the phrase, curiousity killed the cat is a perfect description of me.  I just had to do it.  And of course my suspicions of what people think of me were confirmed.  Yes I am that girl who's pretty cool to have as a friend but I'm kinda chunky and jsut not attractive.  yes it's a shame. Story of my fucking life, it's nice to know that I've made such an impact on someones life that that's all the mention I get in something the length of a novel.  Now I love this guy to pieces and I know he means no harm, but I can't help feeling let down.  It's the sadness that comes with knowing that you've made some of the best friends of your life, they've impacted you, you'll never forget them, but that you've barely made a blip on their radar of life.  When you find out you're no one to people that mean everything it's pretty devastating. 
my first year at university I got to know this exchange student from america, we were pretty good friends but when she went back she cut off all ties in england.  I thought that was a shame, but I think I'm starting to understand why she did it. 
I want to go back to Tennessee so bad.  I had such a great time there, even with all the bad stuff that happened.  But I know that if I did it would never be the same, never be as good.  It's almost as though none of it really happened and it was all just an elaborate dream.  if it wasn't for the physical scars it would be so easy to completely erase all evidence of this year out of my life.  I won't, I don't want to.  That's one of the reasons I'm so keen to keep in contact with everyone, so it doesn't become just a faded memory, because no matter how surreal this year did happen.  And even if I'm forgotten, everyone and everything that happened will stay forever treasured within me.

      Well, my dinner party went really well.  The food was good, the company even better.  it was lovely to see Chris.  I really don’t see him often enough and he really is my oldest friend.  I’ve known him since I was 4 years old, he was even my first boyfriend at the age of 5.  And even though we’ve often gone our separate ways, different classes, different schools etc we always find our way back to each other.
I was terrible with keeping in contact with him while I was in Tennessee, but we’re still the same with each other.  Sometimes I feel kinda weird and insecure that over the year he’s spent a lot of time with my sister, she even went to stay with him in Manchester, but he seemed genuinely to have missed me.  
Me and Liz are so completely different from each other that we can’t really be compared but sometimes I feel that we are and I always miss out.  She’s the wilder, flirtier, more outgoing and prettier sister.  It’s hard to compete so generally I avoid it.  Romantically it’s usually not a problem because we go for completely different types, but occasionally they’ll be that one person we both want, and my self esteem takes a battering when 9 time out of ten I lose out.  Typical.  I think that’s one of the reasons I loved being so far away from home.  I can be who I want.  I always end up being me but sometimes, somehow, more me than with the people I’ve known forever.  It’s strange how that happens.
It must be late I’m getting all inward looking and shit.  Bad idea.
Anyway it’s been a really good day and then I checked my emails and actually had a response from someone, and although it was nothing special or intimate or anything.  Just a brief reply, it was appreciated. 
Now I'm gonna go to sleep and dream wonderful things about people who have touched me not just physically but emotionally.  I'm going to explore the 'what ifs' I wonder about with pleasure but no regrets.  Goodnight.

      OH my god.  I can't believe what I just heard.  I'm totally in shock and have promised not to say anything.  but OMG!  if you happen to read this dude...you are so intelligent, so it's not that.  maybe this is for the best.  Hey maybe you could even come and visit me.  okay so always thinking about myself.  But really I'm sorry and I feel for you I've been very very close to that position. many times.  it fucking sucks.  I miss you and love you.  Keep yourself well.

      so last night after already having stayed up so late, I couldn't sleep, which is bloody typical and now my sleeping pattern is gonna be all screwed up.  So I've had maybe 5 hours sleep.  I hope it's enough.
I've got a dinner party for 6 to prepare for.  Thankgod my sister didn't have to go to work.  Now she can help me cook.  I'm looking forward to it, I just am not really in the mood to start making pizza bases from scratch etc.  Plus I have to go to the gocery store to actuaally get the ingredients.  We're not gonna eat until about 8.30 probably.  That's seems plenty of time to get ready (7 hours) but I know that time will fly by at the speed of light to spite me.
Don't get me wrong, I'm actually in a pretty good mood, just tired.  
Some of my favourite people are coming tonight.  3 girls, 3 guys.  Becks, who I've known since high school, she's fab, my sis and I, then a trio of absolutely gorgeous but utterly gay men. rarrgh! bloody typical.  Oh well they'll have to do.  I've really been missing the company of my straight male friends.  Things could probably be helped if SOMEONE would make an effort and just talk to me.  why do I always get entangled with these moody gits?
oh well gotta go do stuff.  here's a little something I started last night in my delirious insomniaced state 

In silence we sit
as you stroke my hand.
Your touch is gentle and loving,
almost more than I can stand.
Alone now, you don't say a word.
The silence is deafening,
but no one else heard.

We end up kissing often enough,
but socially you ignore me
and it gets increasingly tough.
You look at her fondly as she calls you free
While I sit in the corner,
wishing it could be me.

Then when you pull me to you
my heart lifts and my hopes soar,
but the next day I'm no one
and I feel like a whore.

      well I have just had the most incredible memorable year of my life.  In knoxville, Tennessee of all places! so I think I need to dedicate a lot of space to this and there is a lot of catching up to be done, but as I am a lazy git indeed I will do that at some point but not right now.  To start I am going to post some poems and shit that I wrote so you can all get a laugh.  Gotta put it somewhere so it might as well be here.

      well I have a blog now, what to do with it?  I've got no idea at the moment but it's 3am (english time) and I'm kinda fucked.  who wouldn't be, my mum's been out of town for a week and I'm moving next week so no job to worry about at the mo'.  I will think of something soon.

      it was really weird at issy's party, it was hard for anyone to relax because paul's mum and dad were pottering around trying to get us to eat food and making sure we all had drinks.  I think Issy's a bit depressed, I'm trying to get her to come and stay with me in canterbury for a few days.  I think she relies to much on paul and she was really upset that hardly any of her friends could come in the end.  everyone kept cancelling so I'm glad now that I made the effort to come to london specially for her party.  I felt really bad for her.  well next year i will have graduated and will be living in london permanently (unless I can get a green card, wink wink, hint hint, lol) so I want to arrange something for her.

      when you think you're well and truely over someone, that it's been so long that you've got over the depression, through the anger to forgiveness and actually having fun being platonic friends, isn't it typical that he would say something small and relatively insignificant like "Roberta, I really miss spending time with you", but there's just something about the way it was said and when it was said that felt like it wasn't as innocent as it should be.  So then I get all confused and kinda angry because i don't like having my heart strings tugged, and he knows he hurt me back then, big time.  And, officially he's still with his girlfriend.  I suspect from other sources that he only recently had a huge barney with her and I happened to talk to him when he was a bit trashed, but why say these things?  It makes me begin not to trust him and it will ruin our friendship, and i quite like things the way the are/were thanks.  Besides, all that, regardless of how pathetic it makes me I'm still a little hung up on what's his face.  But I just can't help feeling that attraction start to rise up again, and i don't want it too.  

It would be great if I could just not fancy anyone. life would definately be a lot easier.  Unfortunately knowing myself these people will be on my mind for a while or at the very least till I meet someone new, but quite frankly, how likely is that?

It's a pattern, I resist liking people too much because I always get hurt, i just don't let myself for a long time and then eventually I can't help it and I start to fall, fair hard.  Once it's got to that point and god forbid they actually show some interest it gets really tough.  I try to talk myself out of it, but that's pretty inaffective most of the time.  This only happens about once every two years, but it bums me out.

well blah to that.  I'd love to meet someone and it work out this year, that would be really nice, unlikely, but nice.  But I guess I could benefit from not having anything and actually get on with my studies and maybe for once do alright?

Anyway, I'm back to canterbury properly this time.  I may have officially moved there but I've been backwards and forwards a lot. However, I don't plan to come back to London for a little while now, besides I actually have a job now!  Money! woohoo!

It'll be nice to have something to do, it's been really boring there recently, Victoria works, a lot, so she's not around much and neither is anyone else really.  But I plan to just work any hours I can, get more money and use up more time so that before I know it I'll be in tennessee angain.  It's weird that in a way I actually can't wait to go back to school.  Just for something to do.
