      While walking the streets of where I live, I felt like writing down something good about the City of Rain.  I usually say 'I hate it here', but thats too simplistic I guess, I dont hate it 100%.  There is 10% of goodness here, and its not something conscious, its in the background, usually forgotten or ignored.    Markets on my right, fresh fish, CD-R's, clothes, fruit, market sellers shouting "two for a quid, two for a quid, what a deal!", black people, white people, everything in between people, people with no homes, people with too much money, dressed to kill, kill to dress, street thugs, thug-wannabes, girls, boys, parents, and the soundtrack for today can be RJD2's 'June [Remix]'.  On my left your typical stores, clothes, electrical, nothing remarkable.  Its hard to walk in a straight line, people always in the way, but its ok, they're so distinct and invididual.    I grew up amid many different races, exposed to different systems of living.  For instance when you enter my house, you must take your shoes off.  And you will not find pork in my fridge, although I do eat like a piggy sometimes.  I feel sorry for people who grew up living only around one type of people, because when they grow up they wont feel any kind of affinity for other cultures, they'd appear to alien to them.  And hell, they might even end up racist as a result.      I've hung around many black and Indian people in my life, but never around Chinese or Japanese, which is a shame.  I always wanted an Asian pal, I identify with Asian cultures alot.  They make great food and films, and their family system is similar to the one I've grown up in.  You always see stories about families of ten people all living in the same house or something in Asian cultures, but in the west you'll be lucky to find four people, the mum, dad and their two kids all living together.  Of course I'm generalising here, I'm not speaking for millions of people, but it is something of a defining feature of the two major sides of the planet.  East and West, mingling together more and more these days.  Though in my opinion the West is still more overbearing.    David Bowie can tour the whole of Japan and sing in his own language.  Faye Wong probably would not be able to do this in any 'Western' country.  There is something of an unspoken rule of anything from Asia being converted or filtered before it is allowed in the west.  What the hell makes the west so special anyhow?  I'm so sick of seeing brilliant Asian films being remaked (very poorly too), why not just release them the way they are, and sub them?  I must admit, another good thing about the City of Rain is that we get many subbed foreign films here.  I remember watching Wong Kar Wai's Fallen Angels at the Curzon Soho, watching one of the lead actresses masturbate with an electic soundtrack in the background, and thinking "Yeah, this is how it should be".  I had a slightly different experience at the Prince Charles watching Takashi Miike's Ichi The Killer which is quite probably the most violent and depraved movie ever made, and watching it with this stinky guy on my left eating throughout the entire film was not fun.      Miike is one of my favourite directors.  He makes like 5 or 6 films a year.  And they're all amazingly original and entertaining.  I think I might be in love with Japan.  I know no country is perfect, Japan has its fair share of fuck-ups.  But there is something about that place that draws me; the food, the land, the history, the media, the people; hell even the language is similar to Turkish which I can speak and read.    But I'm not Turkish so dont go thinking you've got me pegged already.  I'm just showing sympathy for the City of Rain which I despise alot most times.  Its not my home, its my habitat, somewhere to live for a while before I move on.  The world is my home, and I just happen to be stuck in the toilet.

      "AAAIIIEEEEEEEE" is what the bears of yellowstone park somewhere in that quirky nation the United States of America screamed in the dead of the night. One day. Probably.    I need to stop babbling on about animals really, this isnt reflecting well on my blog.     Ok, so anyway. I've been bumping into more and more articles and news reports revolving around the Bush administration post-9/11, and as if I didnt feel this already, but they reflect a tyrannical system of control and censorship, fondly reminiscent of  urlLink Mr Stalin  and co back in the day.    2003 was a particularly bad year. If anyone voiced concern over the government's actions they were mocked, ridiculed, fired from their jobs and thrown out of malls for wearing 'peace' t-shirts (this actually  urlLink happened ). Bush said it himself, everyone was with him or against him, life is black and white, its about good V evil, yaddi yadda. The ravings of a maniacal immature teenager would've sounded similar. Not that I'm calling Bush a maniacal teenager, I mean he just reads what people shove in his face; guess my beef is with his insane speech-writers. Everytime I see him addressing the press or public I cringe or just plain laugh, it sounds insanely ridiculous for a President of the Most Powerful Amazing Country in the Planet to say the things he does. But I guess if you dumb down your speech, you kind of dumb down whoever's listening. Which is the whole point of the Bush administration. Maybe.    So the other day I came across Elton John  urlLink explaining  how he and other celebrities felt bullied last year by the government, everyone was afraid of speaking their mind. The Dixie Chicks did, but they got  urlLink flamed  alive. A bunch of other artists did (ok so I cant remember their names and cant be bothered to look them up) and their sales went plummeting and their contracts went snip snip.    Then today while browsing Guardian for news, I came across an article about a film that was completed ages ago but hasnt been released for murky reasons.  urlLink Prozac Nation  is an adaptation of a  urlLink book  by Elizabeth Wurtzel, and one of the reasons, maybe  urlLink THE  reason the film of it has not been released is because of her flammatory comments regarding 9/11.    "I had not the slightest emotional reaction. I thought, this is a really strange art project... it was a most amazing sight in terms of sheer elegance. It fell like water. It just slid, like a turtleneck going over someone's head.' She concluded: 'I just felt like everyone was overreacting. People were going on about it. That part really annoyed me."    Of course she was flamed by the press and everyone else, and I guess rightly so, however we have to take into account Prozac Nation is a sort of biography of her fucked up life and all the many drugs she (and her country) consumed. Now, I dont agree with her comments, BUT that doesnt mean I'd suddenly not release her film, which has nothing to do with 9/11. What purpose does that have? To punish her? She didnt direct the film, she just wrote the source material years ago, she still gets royalties from her books and stuff. Its such a ridiculous knee-jerk reaction that seems to define the US media in this new era. If you criticise the President or the government, you are suddenly deemed unpatriotic and a traitor, or a hippy! Two points:    1) The President likes to boast of his democracy (for more about 'democracy' and such, check out Uncommon Sense in my Links section) and yet he stifles everyones freedom of speech and even worse; their basic human rights (more about this another time).    2) To question your government, to question whether they are doing the right thing or not for your country and the rest of the world is the true definition of patriotism. Probably. I mean I dont agree with the concept of patriotism at all (more about this one day), but if there was a positive thing about patriotism, then the above is it. To not go along with the majority so blindly, to always question and make sure that the actions of the people, supposedly leading you, are RIGHT.    "A patriot must always be ready to defend his       country against his government" - Edward Abbey (1927-1989)    All of the above is all my subjective opinion on the life around me, and anyone reading should not be forced to accept it, but to make up their own damn minds.

      After watching Eddie Murphy voicing a donkey who had been transformed&nbsp;into a white horse, being chased around a whimsical fairy town by knights in shining armour, all being recorded live for the TV viewing masses, and seeing Eddie himself scream "Police brutality! Police brutality!" while being manhandled by the knights, and being arrested on false charges, I have to blink through my tears and wonder if I've been smoking something pungent recently.   It was just Hollywood though, it does that to people.  urlLink Shrek 2  is the joint (step back Spike Lee), the US film industry is the dealer, and the paying public are the junkies. I went willingly into a fantasy land full of talking creatures and ugly green monsters with feelings. Just like I go willingly into the City of Rain, lots of talking creatures there. Especially on the buses. And trains.Everywhere. They haunt me on the pavements and harass me on the phone.   Ok, seriously I havent been smoking. I just had black coffee and was remembering a scene from Shrek 2, thats all. I could've made some allegorical point on the black man, voicing a white horse, imitating a racial event still echoing in the minds of African-Americans in the USA, in an irreverent animated film aimed at the whole family.   But that would have been expected.   What wasnt expected was seeing little Baxter the dog in the recently released  urlLink Anchorman , communicating with crazy bears at one point. Who would've known that dog barks can be understood by bears? I know some girls who bark, maybe I should find a bear to translate their ravings for me. Girl to bear to me. Just bear with me here...

      Blogging; it was bound to happen to me I guess.    I am a writer.    Dont expect a rundown of my private life here; what I ate for dinner, who I licked for dessert and how many crazy people I offended.  Instead expect a commentary of the life around me.  My thoughts, ideas and opinions, all delivered as entertainingly as possible.  I'll only write when I have something to say, be it a rant at the powers that abuse the world, or a review of a film that tickled my insides.  I'll probably be vague at times, but if you read carefully, you might discover more about the world we live in.     More about me too, not that I'm very interesting, or worth knowing that much, but you'd be surprised at what you might learn via my fingers.
