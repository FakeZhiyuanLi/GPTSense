       Just come off the phone from Katie, and my ears are burnig. That phone handset absolutely kills your ears. Anyway, she’s being really annoying now. She keeps phoning me, EVERYDAY. I wish she wouldn’t. I’ve been going and staying on the internet recently about the time she calls so she can’t get though but it seems she’s going to try constantly so I have no choice but to listen to her ramble on about a load of crap. We were, well she was talking for about an hour, more than that even. So I missed relocation relocation and a bit of grand designs, programs I watch every week. She’s really pissing me off now. I’m rtrapped in a relationship which I don’t want to be in. I don’t want to get any further in but I can’t get out because she apparently really really likes me. So Laura was telling me earlier. In science today all the girls bar Laura were out because of the German exchange people, so it was just me Lloyd and Laura on the table. I wish Lloyd was ill that day or something, because there was a good bond going on with us and I felt I could tell her how I feel about Katie but Lloyd kept interrupting and getting in the way. He’s pissing me off to. I feel like I have no choice but to hang around with him all the time when I would prefer to be with my kinda ‘new’ friends. At least they actually listen to me and ask me if I’m ok. Lloyd does nothing like that, he just calls out stupid comments which make me look bad for sitting anywhere near him, and talks to me about stuff I’m not really interested in. Anyway, back in science with Laura, she asked me if I was gay, can’t remember why it came up, oh yeah, cause I wanted the pink set of work cards, anyway, I desperately wanted to say yes, but I had to say no, especially as Lloyd was sitting right next to me. If he hadn’t been there I would probably have said something like, I can’t tell you that, and that would make her think I am, but it would be unconfirmed. I think she would be cool with it but I don’t know if I could trust her not to tell anyone else. I really wish I had a girl best friend type thing going on with someone like Laura or Amy, who I could share these thoughts with, but I’ll be using this for the time being. So after I said No, to Laura’s question, Lloyd chipped in by saying he trough I was Bi, and I don’t think he was joking. I think he refuses to believe I could be gay, but at the same time my campness makes him think I am, and in Lloyd world someone who seems gay but isn’t must therefore be in between, bi, which is bollocks, but Lloyd doesn’t really get the real world. He knows what all the words mean, gay bi straight but his knowledge on these topics isn’t cultured enough. He seems quite homophobic, and he seems obsessed and perhaps disgusted by the thought that there are openly bi girls in out year. Lloyd lives in a world where words are more important than definitions.

       Last day of school today, for the weekend anyway. There’s no school tomorrow because of tutor consultation day you see. Tomorrow me, jack and Lloyd are off to Colchester, I think, to see the new Starsky and Hutch movie, so that should be quite cool. Hopefully tomorrow I’ll also open up a Lloyds TSB bank account, and get myself an Visa Electron card. Once I have that I’ll be free financially from my parents – kind of. It means I can buy stuff online without asking my parents. I tried to open an account with Halifax months ago, in the hope of getting a Solo card, but the bastards still haven’t got back to me, so fuck ‘em, I’ll go with Lloyds instead. Mum took me down to the bowns house today unlike last week, although she almost didn’t cause I didn’t make my bed this morning. But then on my way back down the street (on my paper round) I cocked it all up and missed five houses, so I had to go back and do them all, so it probably took like 15 minutes longer. Then I got back and had dinner – the Jon Carr picnic style speciality. Basically you search the cupboards and stick anything you like on a plate. I had digestives, chocolate swiss role, dairylea slice, and a packet of Worcester sauce crisps. School today was ok, not brilliant, but ok. Lloyds off at the moment with ‘back pains’ so in a couple of subjects I have no one to work with, which is a little annoying. When I got home from school today it was just me and Tori, because mum was at Richards tutor conceltation thing today. We kind of messed about a bit, racing to the bathroom se who could reach it first. I won but I let her go first anyway. Then I went in for a piss and when I came out she was hiding in my bed. So I was rolling over her, like, pretending I didn’t know she was there kinda thing. We were then talking and stuff. I love Tori, she’s great, I think she’s the only person in the whole world I can truly get on with and almost be myself. Naturaly, I prefer being around women, and as my sister I can do and say stuff to her I wouldn’t say to ‘outsiders’. I don’t think she feels the same though. She would make a great best friend I think, if she wasn’t so attached to dad and could understand my sexuality. We have such a laugh sometimes, and are so on the same wavelength. Ok, so, what was I doin today at school. Well, first IT – really boring. At the moment we’re doing a graphics topic and we have to design a garden. This lesson we had to make a list of what we want to change keep or remove – I just don’t see the point. It isn’t ICT. The only thing we ever seem to do in IT is practice using Word. Why can’t they teach as more advanced stuff and things that will make us more productive, things we actually need to know. Why make a written plan of a garden you’re going to design when you wouldn’t in real life? It’s such a waste of time. We should spend more time using the design software than writing crap that at the end of the day will be erased. Oh well, it’ll all be over soon. So, anyway, then I had Business studies, which was ok, we were just doing practice tests on finance, had to calculate and draw a break even chart. Then I had geography, which I’m really hating at the moment, it’s unbelievably boring. Then I had science, nothing special, periodic table type stuff. Finally PE, which wasn’t bad at all. I usually hate PE, bt it’s not bad at the moment because I’m doin lots of badmington, which I don’t mind much. So, today in PE we were doing badmington, and I paired up with david, I wouldn’t normaly but Lloyds not here so, I did. And were played none other than the loverly dean, and emma. [sighs] deans legs, what could be better? He really has the best set of legs on the panet, they are perfect in every way. Dean and Emma, kinda won against us, by a lot, I think, and dean came up with this really sexy phrase – “cheaky number”, meening a move which was sneaky I think. See what I meen by perfect, he says “cheaky number” in a way that makes me write about it. He was also acting very gay/camp, which is always nice to see. Wiggling his ass and stuff. [sighs again]. Me and Katie kissed a couple of times today again. I’m getting used to it, but I still don’t enjoy it. It’s a little worrying though, when you sit down, think about a kiss with the wrong sex and picture it going further (toungs I meen, not any further than that). I guess even when I younger I used to imagine having sex and kissing women, although it was always men I fancied. I was confused back them. I fancied men definatyl, but I don’t think I quite realised that ment I was gay, so before I understood gay sex and the idea that being could be really quite cool, I imagined girls. I always though I was going to get married, to a women and have kids and stuff. I don’t think that no more. When I was making my bed earlier, I sort of laid down and got to thinking that, this journal is something for me to do when I feel like it, and not some kind of thing that must be done regularly. There are no kind of rules. It’s just, if I’m bored I sit down and type what I’m thinking, what I’ve done and what I want to do. If I remember that this is something I can do to just like let it all out and not some kind of diary, which I have to keep updated, I should get on with it a lot better. Right, I’m off to watch the telly now – Tara,

       Right, haven’t updated this in a while but I’ve been a little busy you see. I’ve had a tonne (the metric kind) of homework to do. Well, actually just graphics English and maths, but I’ve been doin a lot of graphics coursework recently. I’ve just finished é.caf, my design for an Internet café in London, well almost, and I think it’s looking quite good. Not as good as I first pictured it but nothing ever does. The Incredible John Culshaw has just stated on TV and to be honest I don’t really feel like writing much more today. Today at school things were quite good, I was happy, although I had a horribly snotty nose and was spraying  it everywhere. Got a bit of a cold at the moment, I don’t think my nose has never been so blocked. I think the kissing counter is up to five now, if I’m counting right, and I’m stating to get used to it. Where at lip level now, and I think Katie was wearing lip gloss especially. The other day I’ve been trying to avoid kissing because I just don’t really want to and I think she really got this message and has been sprucing herself up. I’m just thinking though, is Katie good looking? You know, I’m not sure, I really can’t tell. Blond hair, blue eyes, smooth skin, I guess that’s a good combo. But her shape isn’t really good. She’s all bulky and, I don’t know, not fat but sort of strangely shaped. Maybe that’s a normal women shape though, thinking about it, a lot of girls are like that I think. I’m not really looking at them though, so how can I be expected to know what looks good in a woman. Right, this’ll do for today, I’m extremely tired.

       I just got home from doin my papers 20 minutes ago, and now I’m having my dinner. Just a mixture of stuff bunged on a plate. So, I was home 5 minutes and me phone was ringing – withheld it said, it picked it up they hung up. Again. The same thing happened yesterday at 4:17 and today it was 4:31 (just so I’ve got it noted somewhere). Something pretty big happened at school today, Katie kissed me, I say she kissed me cause it was her who did all the kissing not me. Not that there was much kissing it was a more of a brief cheek slap. Everyone’s being saying we should kiss for quite a while, but up until now she’s been to scarred and I’ve never really wanted to. So, were standing outside my tutor room, there weren’t many people around which I guess was strange seeing as it was absolutely poring down with rain (I had previously got very wet from running through it from youth club to tutor). So, yeah, we’re standing outside my tutor room, and then she has to go to her tutor, which is usually next door but there was some drama exam so her tutor group had been moved elsewhere. She dropped her bag throws her arms around me, I’m thinking, she’s going to kiss me I know it. We’ve been talking about it a lot recently you see, because everyone else is kinda havin a go. Then we pulled apart a little, made eye contact and then she waked her cheek against mine and made that kissing sound. Why do we (as humans) do that, there is no lip usage yet we still make a lip sucking/clicking/kissy sound – odd. Then she picked up her bags, and I picked up her plastic bag, think it had art work in it, and gave it to her. Then she literally ran off towards the door. I then walked towards the radiator, to dry up a little now that it was free, and she looked back seeing me doing a girly walk, which looked like a run towards her. I think she thought I was going after her, and that made her run faster. So, then I was doing a few rolls along the radiator in an attempt to dry up me soaking shirt, and got a crazy look from, oh, whats her name, errrr, oh god what is it [smacks head], Katie, of couse (but not gf Katie a different one in my tutor group). Then miss came along to unlock the tutor room doors and I did a girly walk from the radiator to the tutor room (which I quite enjoyed). I was a little lonesome (is that a word?) in tutor today. Amy and Elle weren’t there to start with, Chris went on the computer to play some game thing and Charlie (as in Charlotte) and Lara were standing the other side of the room by the heater, until they noticed me and came over. I still felt a bit left out though, cause they were talking amongst themselves about some secret thing. It really annoys me sometimes, cause I want to be part of the girls, and talk about fit blokes and the latest episode of sex and the city, but society (the school) wont let me. Laura seems to let me in a lot more, today, she told me about a letter Arron sent her, presumable a love letter, the other day, something which Lara and Charlie refused to tell me the day before, but, to be fair, I suppose it wasn’t there gossip to tell. Of couse Lloyd wanted to know in Science what Laura was talking about but I said nothing, actually I misled him, in an attempt to show the ladies I can be trusted with secret stuff. Not sure if any of them noticed. Arron, really confuses me, he’s so blatantly gay, and yet he does things like send love letters to girlfriends and saying he believes gay people shouldn’t be able to get married and adopt children and stuff. I’m sure it’s a cover. Unlike me he doesn’t want to be gay and denies it through constant gays are bad references. I managed to get out of doing my PE analysis thing today. Basically, one of the PE teachers ask a load of questions about the sport you’ve chosen and grade you for it. The end of the double period lesson came to an end and I was not next but the one after that, so I just missed it. But, of course, I still have to do it, another day, so I guess it isn’t that much of a great thing. Lloyd was sitting with us again today in youth club, which really pisses me off. Lunch time is my girly time, and having a man there doesn’t help. He sat behind me cause there was no room in the human circle, to start off with I pretended I didn’t know he was there until he spoke, then I had to acknowledge him. I did a tiny little flit with Arron in youth club (god I hate hate that name, makes us sound like yobs) as well. He was resting his legs on me seat and when I got up to throw some rubbish in the bin his legs fell down. He jokingly said oh, Jonathon, so I pushed the chair back forward so he could reach. Like I say it was a very small flirt, in fact know one could possible have know it was a flit other than me. You see, I’d only do that for someone I like, besides I enjoy having Arrons legs resting on my seat cause I get to see a little bit of leg flesh (he wares trainer socks), and Arrons got well nice legs – perfectly tanned, perfectly shaped and they have lovely little hares on them. I guess that’s all that happened today, from yourth club me, Katie, Amy and Vicky ran in the rain to our tutors and the rest I’ve already been through. Oh yeah, on the way to maths I saw Amy (not the one just mentioned, a different one, although they both have the same surnames – Smith), and told her about the kissing action, she’s one of the main people trying to get us to kiss. So, we both got all excited and high-pichy voiced, and, you know I might even done a bit of a gay limp hand movement.

       Ok, so I think I’ve reached an important point in my life, just had a wank in a public place for the first time, and I have to say I’m actually pretty impressed with myself. So, my mother usually takes me to the Bowns house on a Thursday because she lives right outside the village and it takes ages to walk there to deliver her paper. But this time cause I apparently haven’t been talking to her today she refused to take me so I walked. It was on the way back I was thinking I might take a long cut through the fields, along the public footpath, it takes a whole lot longer, but that was the point, because the longer it takes me to get back home the more guilty my mum will feel. So, I walking back along some road, don’t actually know whats it’s called, and I thought perhaps when I go through the fields I’ll have a wank, I feel kinda horny. So I go down this other road, don’t know what it’s called either (!) and then up bakers lane as this is where the footpath starts. I go down the path and start to fiddle with me cock a little to get it hard, but nothing much was happening. I got round the corner of the bushes where pretty much no houses can see made sure no one was looking and put me hand down me trousers. I jerked it a ittle and It came to life! So, I’m standing the the middle of the field having a wank, I was finding my trousers quite restrictive so I unzipped and got me dick out and had a proper good wank. It literally lasted about 30 seconds, maybe a minute (time flies when your havin fun) and I came. Holding my cock end cosed I riped a leaf off this plant on the ground and wiped away the ‘produce’. I had to use two leaves. Then I poped it away still a bit cumy, but not to bad, zipped up and through the leaves in a ditch. Then I carried on walking with a pretty big smile on me face. So I’ve just got home and made myself something to eat, a microwavable cheese burger, there ok I guess, get a tad boring when you eat them all the time but my dad seems to buying less of them these days which takes the pressure off I guess. I saw a film a few weeks ago, Cruel Intensions it’s called. It really is very good, I’ve seen it before and I liked it then. So, basically the main character in it, pretty fit by the way, Sebastian keeps a journal thing and I thought I’d do the same, seems pretty cool. So, my names Jonathon William Carr, crap I know, and I’m 16 years old, I’m not going to do the whole Adrian Mole thing and say and a ¼ (which is actually how old I am now), guess I’ve said it now – does that all make sence? I live in a village called Tolleshunt Major, in Essex, UK. It’s pretty small as villages go, and small isn’t good for me. I like to have shops and stuff nearby, we have a pub though, and a postbox! I think when I’m older I would like to live in London, or somewhere, everything I need all in once place – around me. And, you know they say London’s the most gay excepting place in the UK, at least I think they do. So, I guess that’s another details you can know, I’m gay, and it’s pretty important to me now, cause I’m kinda going into this phase where I want everyone to know about it but I can’t tell anyone, which is pretty annoying. I think a few people may have already guessed, but I’m not 100%. God I can’t wait to tell someone. I rekon I kinda like a sterio typical gay guy, I have more girl friends than boy friends, although this is quite a recent thing. I’m quite stylish, I no what’s looks good and what looks shit unlike some idiots. Plus I like to dance around like a girl when ever I move. But, unlike the average gay guy I have a girlfriend. Which Is really annoying me cause It feels like I’m lying to myself. But maybe I’m not, after all I’m able to write down that I’m gay, ‘I’M GAY’ – see. I’m pretty cool with it, but about six months ago, I could never imagined myself having a gay lifestyle, especially not at this age. Ok, so, nowadays I hang out with the girls at lunch and in tutor and some lessons and I enjoy it, we have a laugh. Life hasn’t been all that great recently, things with Katie (girlfriend) aren’t great. We started going out with each other like six months ago, infact it was her who introduced me to her friends which in turn made me realise how cool it was to relate with women. Up till then I had all boy friends, not many though. I’m seen as kind of a geek at school, especially when I was younger, I used to act all posh and clever, when I wasn’t, I wish I hadn’t now, I wish, I’d been myself from day one. So, I kind of have this label of being the geek even now in year 11 when I’m so not. I’m still friends with the ‘lads’ – hate that term, there’s Lloyd, he’s been my best friend since I started in year seven, we didn’t go to the same primary school though. I’m getting to the stage though where I want to shake Lloyd off – nasty I know, and replace him with me girlfriends, you I can associate with much better. It really annoys me when in youth club at lunch Lloyd comes and sits with us ladies, which include me and Arron (he’s gay too but really tries to hide it), cause I don’t feel comfortable being all gay and soppy, with the women when there’s a bloke around. And that’s what happened today, he usually just lingers around but this time he sat down. He’s supposed to stand with the rest of the men by the pool table and do a masculine cheer everytime some gets the balls in the holes, and live us women to have a laugh. Although I do have slight suspicions that Lloyd might me gay as well. I don’t want him to be though, not sure why, I guess I want to be the only ‘unique’ one and not share. I love Arron though, he’s fabulous, very camp and I love that about him. He’s pretty good looking and would be very good looking had it not been the spots on his face. I occasionally fantasize about having a relationship with him, kissing, sucking generally touching naked bodies, that kinda thing, and who knows, perhaps I will one day, when were both out the closet. The other big love interest for me, and has been since I first saw him in that music lesson in year 7, is Dean Courderoy. He is BEAUTIFUL, absolutely gorgeous, every woman in my year must fancy the pants off him. He’s had girlfriends but I’m not entirely convinced he’s straight, he hangs around with the ladies just a little to much, wouldn’t it be great if he was gay? – don’t answer that, it would be. Ohhhh, the number of times I’ve wanked over him, must been more than 500. I think about him a lot and can’t help but stair in class. I’ll tell you though I was THE (emphasise the E sound) luckiest guy on the planet a few weeks ago. As part of my GCSE in PE (I would not have chosen it if we weren’t forced too) I’m doing personal survival, which involves jumping in a pool and swimming and stuff. But I probably won’t do that for my final grade though, cause I was sick both times I went, but that’s another story. So, I’m in the changing rooms with some of the best looking guys in our year, Dean, Justin, and Robin, do I need to say anymore. Dean I’ve just mentioned, he’s the love of my life, not entirely sure on sexuality. Justin, is gorgeous, better looking than Dean I rekon, but he hasn’t got that certain spark that Dean has, I’m almost defiantly sure he’s straight. Infact the only put of me that doubts that, is the part which wishes he was gay. Robin, is quite good looking, although, I’m not really a fan of the big, fluffy, skater-boy hear style, I think he’s straight, but sometimes little comments he makes leads me to think he’s bi. He’s pretty open-minded I think. So, I saw Justin almost naked, he wrapped himself in a towel, so did Dean. But, Dean was sitting down do I was a almost able to see up the towel as he pulled up his boxers (I like boxer shorts). I’ve only seen a couple of cocks in my lifetime which is pretty disappointing. That don’t include porn and stuff, I mean real life cocks. I saw Rob’s on the geo field trip, it was quite nice, looked quite large if I remember, although that might be me imagination! I’ve also seen Will’s a couple of times, on the French trip in year 8, like when his towel dropped, but it was no big deal, it was small, cute though. Apart from that, don’t think I’ve seen any other cock, nothing special anyway. Anyway this is supposed to be a jounal, not my lifes story. Today at school was pretty boring, Errr, I had ICT, where we loaded the PowerPoint presentation up on to the computers since I finished it off a few weeks ago, Lloyd seemed to like it, but I think I might have pissed them all off by adjusting all there bit’s so It looked half decent. Then I had business studies, didn’t really do much other than chat and mess around. The geography, I have a lot to say about geography so I think I’ll leave it for another day. Then science. On Thursdays we have science in the C block, which I don’t really like cause the tables are in twos, I sit with Lloyd. In most other rooms though the tables are in groups which I prefer (sitting with the ladies you see). I did crap on the science test, I think I roughly worked it out to be about 30% - shockingly shite. Final lesson of the day, was PE. Were doing this analysis thing this week, which meens all PE lessons (3) are practical. So I was playing Badmington, partnered with Lloyd, think we lost both games we played – I’m pretty crap at it, so is he. Think I’ll leave it there for today, bloody hell, I wrote a lot. Don’t be expecting that much everyday.

       Todat was pretty cool. As part of my pe exam stuff I went to this athletics centre place in Chelmsford with a load of people from school. It was pretty cool as I was with Arron. God, I love him so much. We sat next to each other on the minibus. Imagine, both of us wearing shorts in a crampt minibus, there was just a little bit of leg touching/rubbing. Sighhhh. So we were at the center thing and we kinda hung out which was cool. And then when we came back to school we walked down together to Robinsons where I was meeting mum, although Katie tagged along for a little bit of the way, which wasn’t to good. Cause I spend all that time being all gay with arron, and then I had to hold her hand and kiss her. Yesterday we all left the youth club early and we sat down on the grass square thing which was fantastic. I felt very nice to be out in the sun with my friends. I made myself a daisy chain bracelet, and of course everyone was making comments, gay ones, which I was lovin. Katie has stopped phoning me now, which although I like, I know the reason she’s doing it. It’s an attempt to piss me off, she’s playing hard to get I think. She thinks I like our phone conversations, and therefore expects me to phone her, but I don’t so I wont. I guess I’m playing hard to get as well. But only one of us can do this, you can’t have to people going in the opposite direction. For a successfully relationship both parties should come together. Katies going inwards for us to meet in the middle but I haven’t gone in because the stuff inside really doesn’t appeal to me. So she’s chasing me and I’ve just jumped in a car and sped off into the horizon. She’s given up and walked back out to try and gult me into coming back.

       So, I’m back at school now, and I guess it’s not too bad. Things with Katie are really bad though. I haven’t done the letter thing yet. When it comes down to it I just can’t do it. Me and Katie though, kinda aren’t talking and apparently she’s almost been cryin and shit. I keep receiving messages from other people about me and Katie. She’s telling her friends stuff like its all bad but pretending it’s good when she’s with me. We really need to talk I think and get everything out in the open. Laura was having a go at me today because I didn’t tell Katie I’d miss her on the phone the other day, cause Katie’s been telling her. I explained that I don’t like hints and all that and I think I got off. I’m guessing Laura’s probably passed this on to her so she’ll probably be hassling me tomorrow.  Anyway when we kissed at the end of lunch today I flung my leg into the air (just like any other fabulous woman) and ended up kicking heather’s bag which Laura thought was unbelievably funny, because it’s so feminine. Which I hope will get people thinking I’m gay. It’s really kind of annoying me at the moment the way that everyone treats me straight. I guess I do act straight when it comes to Katie. I need to act all ‘nice’ about her all lovy dovey to get people thinking of me as gay, but then they’ll just think I’m in love with Katie, god life’s confusing. Ok, so I have a couple of options. I can pretend to love her and leave her when we go to Ireland and forget all about it. With this option I risk having to be with her if I don’t go, she’ll get even more attached (if that’s possible) and I’ll have to put up being with her for a little longer (I’m not sure I can bear it). Or I can tell her I don’t love her. Leave her, maybe loose some new friends, disrespect from some people, but at lest I can get out of this hell hole now. Which one? I don’t know? The latter is best in the short run, the former is better in the long. I think. The short being max week and long being a few months. Not much difference so maybe I should stay with her. Try and get closer to keep everyone happy and forget when I move where I can start my new gay lifestyle. The thing is though I want to be gay now, with these friends and that can’t be done unless I break up. My ladie friends can’t possibly imagine I could be gay whilst I’m with Katie. I want the best of both worlds but I can’t have it. Right I’ll have to think about it. Anyway, I’ve realised something. I’m in love with arron. I realised it yesterday when at break he waved to me access the thingy and I waved back. Our eyes connected for a second and I felt someone small but powerful. I really think I love him. He’s so gorgeous. With arron it’s different. Unlike dean and Justin I don’t think about fucking, sucking or rubbing him I just want to lay with him in bed. Cuddle him and kiss him with my tounge. I figured I’d add some lite porn at this point. Spuce this journal up a little. That’s want I want with arron, two beautiful hunks of man to hold and kiss each other. Ok, so I’m off now to watch Frasier.

       So, it’s the last day of the easter holidays toady and I’m not sure I want to go back to school tomorrow. We no longer have to were uniform which is quite good I suppose. I didn’t send the letter, and it’s now really pissing me off. If I was going to send it it had to be done of Thursday, Friday absolute latest, but I didn’t have a stamp, and if I ask my parents they will omly demand to know what I want it for. So I’ll go back tomorrow and she’ll be waiting their in the D block to kiss me and I really don’t want this relationship to go on any longer. After what I’ve been thinking and saying to myself recerntly I really can’t see how I could go to school and continue to go out with her. I can’t say it to her face, it’s just to hard for me. That leaves mail or email. Using email to break up with someone, especially someone who is in love with you is not good. Mail is my only option but when do I post it? I think my best option will be Thursday night/Friday morning so it will arrive on Saturday. That way I don’t have to see her the next day at school. But then perhaps that would be the better idea. If I post it tomorrow it will arrive Wednesday and I can confront her at school Wednesday/Thursday/Friday and get over it. Or maybe I should just give it to her and tell her to read it when she gets home. If I give it to her on Monday last period in IT, just when were leaving, then she will be forced to read it at home. Then Tuesday I wont have to confront her until lunch. There, that seems the best idea. That also gives me a couple of opportunities to have a conference with Amy, I really need to confide in someone about this. On Thusday me and mum went to Freeport and I bought a couple more tops. I need to make sure I’ve got lots to wear so that when I go to school I non-uniform for the next month or so I don’t look like the ‘dirty’ kid. I’m now not so sure the two new tops I bough are that great. I got a brown one which in heinseight was perhaps not a great colour to choose and a white short sleeved top which was also not to good because it’s a little big and short sleeves really don’t suit me. Oh, well. Tomorrow I will be wearing my calvin-klein jeans with probably my optitions top and beige shows. So, I should look good hopefully. My spots are going down quite nicely so as long as I don’t start binging on chocolate as soon as I go back I should have a nice clean face, and the facial mask I’m using at the moment makes my skin really smooth so hopefully when I go back to school next week I should be really lookin good. On Wednesday me Lloyd and jack went to la cinema (en francais) and we saw Shaun of the Dead which was really very good. We also plaid quasar (dunno how to spell that) which was fun, although I came second last in my team (of 7). Since then I’ve been tryin to revise, got my GCSE’s coming up in a few months, less than that even, but I just can’t seem to get going with it, just so boring. Right that’s enough for now, I’m gonna have a go at doing some revision and homework.

       Today was pretty crap, Katie had to come round my house, which I really didn’t like. It was awful and I don’t want to do it again. I think today has fuelled my [can’t think of the word that goes here] to post that letter. Hopefully she’s now getting the message, that I don’t really like her. Towards the end they was a bad atmosphere, after we argued about sound speed crap. We were talking about concord, and she said ‘I wonder what it must feel like to be on it, things must look really strange’. I explained that it wouldn’t look much different outside as it does in a standard plane, but she was intent on talking about things looking stange when she didn’t actually have a point to her ‘lecture’. She gave me this look as if to say your so stupid, and was saying stuff like whn don’t you understand, it’s really obvious. Errr, excuse me you stupid bitch, who her is in the lowest science set and reads harry potter. That’s another thing we were argueing about, the the dvd I brought around the other day. The comedy in it is to advanced for her closed mind, she just can’t comprehend it. It’s a fucking chick flick for god sake, girls are ment to like it, all girst should like it, I like it, and yet she doesn’t. She is diffinatly part of dumb Britain. The population of Britain that watchs ITV and thinks peter andrey is funny and clever. Sometimes I feel like I’m the only decent, normal, person ain the whole fucking world. Someone who can appreciate good music, film and art. Someone who actually gets ‘it’ - life. So were sitting there on the sofa, I’m trying to get away as far as possible from her and she keeps moving closer. It ends up with her all over me, well, cuddled up to me with her head on my shoulder, which makes me really uncomfortable. Then we were talking about the weird stuff about fingers and toes, and she held my thumb and I really had to pull my hard to get it out of her grip. What the fuck was the stupid girl trying to do. She just doesn’t take a hint, I don’t like her. She’s trying to get all close to me and I don’t want her to, I keep rejecting her advances but she’s just to stupid to pick it up. She reckons I have a weird thumb cause it bends back, as far as I know that’s what thumbs do, apart from her fucked up thing. So then we were talking about psychological stuff, like why I don’t tell her how I feel. I tried to explain that I only tell my true feelings to those I feel closest to. But I don’t she really picked up on the fact that I don’t tell her stuff therefore she can’t be close. I think she began to get the message when she was going about how opposites (us) attract and I argued they didn’t. I said you need a good mixture of similarities and differences for a good relationship. I then went on to say that we basically have no similarities. I know it sounds really nasty but I hope she goes home to night and feels really bad, stupid, and starts crying or something. God, I’m really callous, but that’s what the silly cow does to me. I do not like her as a girlfriend and I’m now starting to realise that I would also hate her as a friend.

       It’s 12:24 In the morning. I’m still up downloading another anti-virus program to help me get rid of the bastards. I’ve already managed to find and erase 3 in the last few days, maybe this one will find some more. I phoned Katie earlier, which was technically yesterday, I had to tell her she can come over on Thursday. My mum is insistant on me inviting her over because I always go to hers. I really don’t want her to come, it’s going to be so so boring, I know it will. That should be the last time I see her before we become ex’s. I still want to go ahead with the leter posting, but speaking to her today only makes me feel guilty about writing a letter expressing my guilt! But is has to be done. I can’t go on any longer with this, it really is tearing me apart. I hate going out with her so much. I was looking in the kays catalogue earlier as well, just looking at suits for the prom, although, I don’t intend to have a girlfriend when I go to it. I like the Nehru style, which a kind of professional Indian influenced style, in black and pinstripe.

       I’ve just finished writing a letter to Katie explaining that I want to break up with her. I gave her a load of bullshit saying that it didn’t feel right going out with her when I didn’t love her. I guess that’s partly true but the fact I’m gay and the fact I actually don’t like here also play a part in the desission I made to end it all. I havn’t posted it yet, and I don’t intend to for a few days. Shes going on holiday next week so I’ll post it then so she gets it when she comes back, I don’t want to spoil her holiday. God I’ve just had a though though, what if she buys me something from spain, and comes back to find a letter saying I want to break up our relationship. I’ll have to tell her I don’t want her to buy me anything. If she phones tonight, which wouldn’t surprise me, I might tell her I wrote her a letter, I’m not sure if I should, I wont tell her what the letters about, no I wont. I’ll tell her not to buy me anything and post the letter while she’s on holiday. I really am not sure if I can do it though, it’s a really simple action, putting a letter though a slot but the consequences will be so bad I’m sure. She’ll tell all her friends, who are kind of my friends and they’ll hate me I think. I suppose they might see it from my point of view, especially if Katie lets them read the letter, I hope she does because I want to be able to explain my reasoning to all the girls as well as Katie. Hopefully they’ll support me, they know things aren’t that great between us, and hopefully they will agree that I shouldn’t go out with someone I don’t love. Perhaps they will even feel sorry for me, which would be good, it would be really good if they all felt sorry for me including Katie and could all understand where I’m coming from and we could all remain friends that would be great. I think we go back to school on a Monday, and first lesson I have ICT, with Katie, which is not ideal. I want to see her at lunch time and give her a big hug straight away, and hopefully she’ll think it’s sweet and forgive me so I can put my conscience to rest. Anyway, the other day, Saturday, I went to Katies house and we watched a couple of movies. I brought round virtual sexuality, which I personally think is a pretty cool film, but she didn’t really give it a chance and nor did her brother who insisted on sitting in the living room with us. She just wouldn’t shut up though both films we watched going on and on and on about her new job. She just keeps on talking and she says the same things over and over. It’s really annoying me now that she keeps on saying realistically, it’s as if shes trying to impress me with what she thinks is a big word and with her psychological knowledge which is frankly a load of bolloks. Yesterday she phoned me up, AGAIN, and was lecturing me on how people shouldn’t change themselves physically. I meen I can understand how changing your mental self is not a good thing, because that is something built in and can’t be changed unless you act or were acting as the case my be. Then she go’s and contradicts this by saying it’s ok to dye your hair, cause she dyes her’s. I think she’s confusing changing your mental self and physical self. She was also saying that people should be happy with how they look and not try to change it, she is so stupid, change is key to progression, the thing that made our race so powerful. The thing that after thousands of years has allowed me to touch a button in a controlled environment, in a democratic society, and make a character magically appear on the glass panel in front of my eyes. Katie now want’s us to do something over the holidays, and my mum insists that she has to come here, to my house, which I don’t want. She wants to take things further, I know she does. Like when I was at her house the other day. She was sitting there and she said, ‘people like shona keep saying we have to take things further tonight’ which was blaitently a hint at me to actually go a head and take things further. She is so crap at hints, and I hate hints, say what you meen and don’t try and cover it up with some shit. Yesterday on the phone she said to me, ‘why don’t you take hints very well’ – that bitch, she has the audacity to say that I don’t take hints, oh, I get the hints, I receive the hints, I process the hints, I juat pretend I don’t to fob her off. I can’t belive the silly cow isn’t getting that, does she not realise that every time she hints at comeing round mine I make an obvious excuse as to why she can’t, she’s the one that doesn’t take a fucking hint. Just a minute ago is was thinking I can’t send that letter but all I have to do is think about that conversation and I’ll have no problem sending the fucking thing. For the rest of the conversation on the phone I didn’t really bother listening, I just left her to yap on while I watched TV, and just said the occasional ahh-huh. I think by the end of it she was realising that I was angry with her, and when she said bye and just bye back and slammed the phone down, hopefull she’ll start to get the message. Hopefully she’ll see a bad side to me which will cushion the hurt when she reads the letter.

       I got my first 'nasty' comment today. I was walkin back from the dinner hall at break, and as I walked past the E block, someone shouted QUEER. It actually made me laugh, I though it was quite cool. Yeah, whoever said it is a total wanker, but at least people now recognise me. I did think about putting my finger up without lookin back but I didn't. Anyway, school is almost finished, tommorrow will be my last full day at school. Everyone's got books and getting people to sign them and stuff. I'll have to remember to bring one in tommorrow myself. It's really sad, cause I've really made some good friends these last six months and I feel now like they're all leaving. I kinda don't want to go to Ireland anymore but i'll just have to see what happenes. I would love it if the rest of my family went away and I stayed with one of my friends like Laura B or someone that would be so cool. I feel so close to Laura B at the moment, I'm actually starting to imagine myself kissing her. Don't worry, I havn't swiched teams, just feel like being close to her and having a 'bond' with someone. It would be good practice too. I might even say something some time. If we get on the subject of kissing, I'll say I've never kissed and need practice and It'll go on from there. Life at school, is, really quite good right now. Finally I feel like I can be myself. Talk about guys, fashion and stuff, it's all good. Dean was looking gorgeous today. He was wearing shorts, so I could get a look at his beautifuly long slender legs. He knows I fancy him, and things get really awkward when we see each other. There ain't much eye contact goin on. Oh well, I don't expect him to feel the same.

       Wow. My mum now knows. I wrote a letter last night and left it for this morning. Here's what I wrote:   Dear Mum, 	There’s some stuff you need to know, which I feel I can’t say to you directly. I figured I’d write a letter to let you know.  This is going to be a shock, and I think you should make sure your sitting before reading on.  Last week, on Wednesday, me and Katie broke up. I didn’t tell you before because I knew you’d ask why and the reason is really complicated and hard for me to say. Ok, so here goes, I’m gay. I’ve known for quite a long time, and I recently ‘came out’ to my friends at school. I’m ok with it, they’re ok with it and I hope you will be to. I know you can be quite homophobic, but I hope in time you will grow to realise that I’m still the same person.  I don’t want Dad to know straight away, I’d rather I could talk to you first. I really hope you can still accept me and that you won’t make a big deal about it. I realise this will probably shock you and that it may take you some time to get used to the idea.  This is a really hard time for me and I could do with your support. I don’t expect you to accept homosexuality in general, I know you were brought up being taught that’s it’s wrong and all that. I can’t help it, it’s just how I am. I didn’t choose to be gay.  I know I never say it, but I do love you.  Jonathon.  x x x   When I got hoem from school, she was outside in the back garden. I went straight out and asked if she was ok. Richard and Tori cqame out ss well, so I couldn't really say anything, but once they went we briefly said a few things. She asked how long I'd known, and why I went out with Katie. I was just talking to her in her bedroom, and we had a more in depth discussion. I do feel better that she and pretty much everyone else knows. Today at school, was partly good, but also partly a nightmare. Everybody now knows about me being gay and I've just had people coming up to me constantly asking if it is true. In science Charlotte asked me, cause the other people in the class were to afraid to ask me themselves. I told her I was, and she said we could be friends and go shopping and stuff. She was really nice about it. She even said gay people are fucking fashionable. So, I've had people from me year group looking at me all day, and I have to say it's been kinda fun. All my friends have been really supportive and great about it. I stupidly told Lucy the other day I fancied Dean, cause now everyone seems to know that part as well, which is extreamly embarissing. I'll be seeing him tommorrow first lesson in Graphics, so I don't know what's going to happen there.

       The prom on Friday was a lot better than I though it was going to be. Me and Katie sorted out 'the issue' in the limo I hope. We talked a few things through, and I think she's coming round. Me and Katie went in together, linked arms. She was still my date despite everything that had happened. We went in and I was lucky enough to get a table with the girls just as it was about to fill up. Lloyd on the other hand wasn't. I was quite happy about this even though it sounds really selfish. I little way into the night Lucy came up to me and we had a brief little chat. It seems that pretty much everyone in the year knows about me now. She was really nice about it and we had a couple of dances together which was great. I really felt comfortable with her. We did some pretty steamy stuff as Gemma pointed out later. Lucy said she really fancied me and though I was handsome. I don't know how true that is but it made me happy. I bonded quite well with Laura B as well. She was smokeing and she gave me a few puffs, a 'drag' I beileve it's called. The first time made my cough, but after that I though it wasquite good actually, I never though it would be like that. Katie was a bit disgusted that I would do such a thing, but if you don't try new stuff you'll never know. I'm kinda looking forward and dreading tommorrow. I don't know what it's going to be like. I imagine everyone will be asking whether it's true or not and I'm sure there will be a few comments, but with the support from my friends I think I can get through it. I really need to tell my parents today because I'm sure Richard and Tori will find out soon enough, and it'll be better coming form me. I've written a letter actually and I might leave it for them (well, mum) to read while I'm at school tommorrow. I guess it depends whether the right moment comes along today or not. Yesterday, we were in Chelmsford, and I bought myself a new bag, and a bracelet - both Ben Sherman. I'm quite looking forward to showing them off tommorrow at school.

       Today started really badly, English was as boring as hell, Science was also boring, and everyone was just interested in Lloyd. This seems to be a new thing. Nobody really cares about me anymore and they all want to talk to Lloyd, and I can understand why, cause he makes them laugh and that, I'm a little jealous I guess. Double PE was absolutly horrible, always is. Heather and Lloyd were talking amoungst themselves 99% of the time and I was stuck with Arron Tickner, who's a total twat. He was really pising me off. Launch was when my day dramaticly improved, I was in youth club, I had heather to one side and Arron and Gemma to the other. I mentioned if anyone had seen Sex On TV last night. Gemma and Arron both said they had, and gemma said about the gay rimming bit. I turned to face her put my hand up to the side of my mouth, and said, in the gayest way imaginable, "I liked that bit". She burst out laughing, and I caught Katie shaking her head at me. That pissed me off a little. Anyway, at the end of lunch, we were walkin down to the D area, I got lumbered with Katie again. I finally said something to her, and she said "Oh, you are talking to me then". When we arrived at the D block, she said she really wanted to kick me in the balls and stuff. Then she suggested that she didn't believe I was gay, and said it was a phase. I told her I liked men and I didn't like women sexually. That I'd know for ages. But, she still wasn't convinced. In tutor Ellie sat down and said, what have you got on your face. I came right out, and said foundation. She asked why, I said it covers my imperfections ad spots and stuff. She then went on to ask me why Katie and I broke up, I though she might know and was trying to get it out of me. When Amy sat down as well, they where kinda both wanting to know why. I leaned in towards them, and said I don't want everybody to know about this, so keep it to yourselves. I'm Gay. They sat back smiling, not saying anything. Then Ellie put her hand out and shook mine and said well done. Then she said, nah lets have a hug. So we hugged accross the table. Amy remained silent and I said to her, please say something. Then Lara came in and said, atleast now we can all talk about boys and make up and stuff. Then Amy asked who I fancied, I said Dean, Justin. Ellie agreed about Dean, but no of them really liked Justin, cause he's so full of himself. Once Amy had a few minutes to think she was fine about it. It felt so good, deffinatly one of the highlights of the week. I can't wait for the prom now. Now Amy nad Ellie know, I'll be able to talk to them about fit guys as well. I was hoping to go to Lara's afterparty, it would be so great, talking about men and all, but I'm not sure I can go, apperently, her parents have said only eight can go, and it's full. I've texted her, in the hope she can make an exception but I wont hold my breath, I should have sorted this a while ago.

       My mum was just in my room, when I was watchin Fairy God Fathers and she goes "is he gay", I said yeah. She then said are you gay, and I said yeah, to which she laughed and said you better not tell you dad. SHE THOUGHT I WAS JOKING! God, it's gonna be so hard to tell them, when the time comes.

       I'm getting really scared now. It's starting to get out about my sexuality. Origionaly I only wanted a few people to know, a few of the girls, but the more people that know, the more chance it has of getting out, and I'm not sure how but I think it's already on its way out. I think in the long term, my gayness getting out will be quite cool, but to begin with, it'll be a right old bugger, and I'm really scared about violent reactions to the news. Arron was really nice about it today. He wrote me a note in youth club, just saying that, he knows, that he's ok with it, and that I should make sure I'm sure before it gets out everywhere, cause there'll be no turning back. I wrote a note back to him saying that I've known for a while, and that I'm happy they were all being really supportive. He's so sweet, I'm still in love with him. I hope he suddenly realises he's gay, and comes out as well, I really do. Katie is still really angry with me, and I completly understand why. I wouldn't like it if my boyfriend suddeny told me he was straight. I'm not really sure what we're gonna do about the prom tommorrow, I guess I'll just have to go with the flow.

       Where do  start. A lot has happened today. Ok, the biggest thing is that me and katie have split up. One of the girls, Laura B, I think, hinted that I had told her something about me to katie. Katie got in a stress about it cause I don't tell her anything at all. So, I saw her outside the A block area after break and said hello, as you do, and then Victoria, said can I speak to you lloyd, and sort of led him away. Katie said she was really pissed off, cause I don't share stuff with her. We walked down to the C block, where we stopped to talk. She asked if I was gay, I said yeah. I sort of imagined that she would run off crying but she didn't, she asked a few questions like how long have you been gay, to which I replied all my life. She was so pissed off with me, she had every right to be. I hugged her twice, and on the second time she went to kiss me and I turned my face so she got my cheak. The bell went and she went off in one direction, and I in the other. I went for a short walk just to clear my head, and then went up to science, where lloyd, the lauras, gemma and heather were all waiting. I think gemma said are you alright. I nodded. I felt so so bad. Lloyd kinda ignored me, I don't think he ment to but I felt like that. I walked over to where I leave my bag and started unpacking. When I turned around I saw them all going down the stairs to the other science room. They though we were in the other room today, but then Mr Doyle came along to our class and I walked in, there was so much in my head I forgot to talk my bag off. Anyway, I sat down with no one else around me cause they had all gone to the other class room. I almost started crying, I was so close. Then in came gemma and heather, later followed by lloyd and the lauras. They asked if I was alright, and I said no. They sorta asked what happened and stuff and I told them but I was trying not to say anything in front of lloyd, cause I didn't know how much he actually knew. We then went to english, and I walked with Laura B. I was nice, I felt as though, she kinda forgave me for what I done to her friend. Anyway she asked what I said, what katie said and all that kind of stuff. After English, me and lloyd were walking down the stairs and he said, Jonathon, I think I should clear the air. I know. I asked how much he knew and he said everything. I felt good to finally be honest with him. I said I'm glad we got that out the way. Surprisingly he was really nice about it. I didn't expect that at all. I though he would absolutly hate me but he didn't, he treated me no differently to how he normaly does. I went into youth club and sat down next to arron, he asked if we'd split up, I said yes. Everyone was kinda asking questions which I was fine about. Lloyd came over towars the end, and I actually didn't mind, perhaps insted of trying to move on from lloyd, I should be taking him forward with me. He asked me a few things, and for the first time in a long time I felt I could tell him anything. I can't believe how much difference coming out has made in my life. I'm glad it's this way. Quite a few people now know, 12 I think, and it does feel good. Victoria's just texted me to say she knows and thinks Katie will come around, which is good news I guess. It's all definatly for the best and I think today, will also be one of those days I'll never forget.

       So, I wore foundation today, and I think it looked great. If you get it right it makes your skin so smooth and clean looking. Only one person noticed, Amy, in afternoon tutor. To start with she didn't believe me, and then we got talking about it and I was explaining my applying technique. I think my sister noticed this morning at the bus stop. She goes, what have you got on your face, I said stuff, trying to avoid saying foundation in front of the others. Then as we walked over to where the bus stops she said you need to rub it in a little more under your eyebrows. So, I think she knew, just didn't want to embarrise me, which was nice of her. I hopeing my mum will notice, or tori tells her, cause then she'll confront me about it and it'll be the perfect oppertunity for me to ask if she can buy me my own bottle thing. I really did look fantastic today, along with my new found like for foundation, I was wearing my pinstripe trousers and my white 'Guide London' top. I felt really good about myself, I think making yourself my physicaly attractive can also affect your mental state of mind. I especialy liked the fact that Amy said I did a good job of it. Lloyd and gemma seem to be getting on really well at the moment which annoys me. I want to move on but my past is clinging on. Usually in science lloyd goes on the computer, but today he stuck with me and the girls, infact he actually sat in my place, but I still got in there by sitting next to gemma but where the cuboards are, so it was a little uncomfortable. Laura B said hello fagot boy at the start of the lesson, which I should find offensive but I didn't, I just said Hello back, as if to say, I'm not going to argue with the truth. Later on she said I was sweet, which made me feel really great. I think Laura might want me to be her GBF, and I would love to do the honour. Perhaps I should leave gemma to lloyd and choose laura insted, she's just as cool. I've been so so so tired these last few days and it's really pissing me off. I try to go to bed early, 10:00, but I ended up not going to sleep until like 12:00. I want to see if we have any sleeping tablets cause I'm in dire need of a decent nights sleep. My eyes are aking so much, I was strugleing to keep them open all day. Graphics this morning was pretty good. Although the stuff were doing (revision) is terribly boring, I'm now sitting with Heather and Rachel, and I love sitting with the ladies, it just makes me feel so much more comfortable.

       Today was ok, coulda been better, but that’s life. I stated with IT, which was just as boring as usual,  Then in RE, we had this religious rock band kinda thing come in, which was a total imbasesment. We had to do these dance moves and things along with the band. It was quite interestingthough. One of the woman was talking about when she had an abortion and it was really sad, she was almost crying, and I swear if she had I would have to. I could feel myself welling up but I managed to hold it in. In science I felt quite alone to start with. Lloyds pissing me off right now. I found these new friends and I want to start afresh, specially with what’s happened recently, but Lloyd keeps me back, I can’t be gay with him around. Then gemma and laura asked me what I’m gonna do about Katie, I said I didn’t know, and we sort of briefly mentioned a few ways of going about it. But with Lloyd there I couldn’t really talk. It was later on in tutor that I found myself talking to Charlie about it. She asked me when we were waiting outside what I was going to do with Katie, I sort of said I could either break it up with her, and give a false reason, or tell her with the real reason, that she’s the wrong sex, or I could wait and see if I’m moving away in which case the break up will be externally forced, if that makes sense. Then when we were in tutor she sat next to me and we and Amy had a bit of a laugh. In tutor there is a pretty clear devision between the two halfs of the room, and we were all saying that we were the real cool ones because we didn’t actually have to say we were cool. I sort of managed to get in a comment about that half of the room being all those macho boys, which hopefully ment something to Charlie, ie, I’m not one of the macho boys. Today I wore makeup to school. I think It gives my skin a better look, but I think I need to still experiment a little more to get it right. I’ve also just discovered johnsons baby lotion, it makes your skin so smooth so I’m defiantly gonna try that tomorrow morning. I thinkit’s about time I started buying my own face masks and stuff instead of using my mums stuff. I’m starting to really not care wehether my parents no my sexuality. The other day my dad and uncle were making some really homophobic comments and I so wanted to just shout out I’M GAY, but I didn’t, I wouldn’t.

       Ok, so, some really massive stuff’s happened these last few days. Wednesday was a really big anti-climax for me. I kinda thought after what happened on Tuesday there would be a lot more interest in my answer and stuff, but there wasn’t. I felt as if people were avoiding me or something, not in a nasty way, if you know what I mean. I was expecting far to much to happen Wednesday, I thought it would be the start of a whole new life and it wasn’t. When I got home I had a really big cry, it was the most I’d ever cried as far back as I can remember. My parents were away (looking at houses in Ireland) so, it didn’t matter how much noise I made. I let it all out. All my pent up depression, all my crap, I just got it all out of my system. Then I went downstairs took two paracetamol with a glass of water and went to sleep. I’ve never considered taking drugs, but these were amazing. I didn’t know drugs could help me so much. After resting for half an hour, I got up feeling fantastic, well, not fantastic, but an awful lot better than I had done previously. Then I went around the house doing house work, singing Sinatra and had some stuff to eat, watched a movie, and decided this would be a new start for me. I realised during my crying fit that I’ve been depressed for many years, but just accepted it as a part of my life. Seeing people around me recently having the time of their lives, only made me feel worse, from seeing what I did not have. That’s the reason for my recent extreme depression. So, I went to school, on Thursday, determined it would be different and it was. Second lesson was business, and as usual, I tried avoiding having to walk with Katie from IT. But she just hangs around waiting for me. She’s so stuck in routine. Anyway as we split to go our separate ways we kissed, I stuck my leg in the air, as usual, and gemma saw. She didn’t really comment on the leg and said something like aaarrrr. I sorta did a gay head shake and smile and went into the classroom. Then we had science, I think Laura K must have told Lloyd what happened on Tuesday, cause he made a comment on it. Something like what’s all this about laura asking whether you were gay, and you didn’t give an answer”, I started saying, “the reason I didn’t give an answer was” and then he interrupted with something like, “it’s ok if you gay”. I didn’t say anything. I think Lloyd thinks I’m gay, cause latter on he said he though the teachers were a bunch of homosexuals (as an insult rather than it’s actual meening), and there was a second-long, weird atmosphere and he kinda looked at me to see if he had offended me or something.  Anyway, that lunch time was really good. I didn’t sit next to Katie but opposite her, I find this is a much better way to sit cause by doing this I seem to get inside the group more. I had heather to my right and gemma to my left. It was good, despite the fact that some twat pulled my chair from under my arse causeing me to fall to the floor. But, it was after lunch that the really good stuff started to happen. On my way to PE, I caught up with Laura B. To start off with there was a kinda awakward silence, but I did something gay, like walk around a muddy area or something. She said “you’re so gay”. Then she said “are you bi”, I said no firmly, and she said “are you gay” and I said yeah. She responded with a kinda high pitch excited, wow, your gay, really, I can’t believe it and that sorta stuff, I looked over my sholder to see if anyone was around, I told her to keep it down and not make a big thing out of it. She did. She said she wouldn’t tell anyone, but I said I didn’t mind the girls knowing. On our way into the sports centre she said what are you gonna do about Katie, I said I didn’t know and that was that. I sat down for a crapy PE lesson with a massive smile on my face. That moment where I said “yeah” and she got excitable, will be something I will never forget, it will be one of those key moments of my life. Today, wasn’t quite as good, but a lot better than a lot of the days I’ve been having over the last nine months. Once again by sitting opposite Katie I found myself in a much better position to socialise with everyone. I was talking to Gemma quite a lot. It was good. I’m so happy right now.

       Something so, so big happened today. I kinda came out. It was in science, and Laura asked me that question, “Jonathon, are you gay?” I didn’t give an actually answer, but said “that’s an awkward question”. Which basically meant YES. So, gemma heard as well, which was really cool. And then Laura passed it to other Laura and Heather heard. So, that’s four people who hopefully now think I’m gay. After Laura asked me I was so embarrised, I said something like “I’m going all red now”. Then sir started talking so we had to quieten down. I was shaking and my heart was beating so fast while I sat writing stuff down trying to avoid making eye-contact. Once he finished other Laura (Laura K) said “I don’t think your gay”. I responded with “Why not?”. Gemma was really nice about it. She was telling the others to stop going on about it and that, and when we were leaving class she said, just ignor Laura B, or something to that effect, which was so nice of her. I want to be her GBF. Although it was really hard, it felt soooooo fantastic. I’m really looking forward tomorrow, business studies first lesson, and who’s in my class, only, GEMMA. So, I’m hoping we might have some little ‘chat’. Where I could climb further out the closet. Gemma is the one, she’s the one I want to tell everything to. At launch, I once again ended up outside the main gang. I tried to sit in the middle area in the hope I would be closer to the centre, but the circle ended up forming in the wrong place. I’m hopeing after today, more of the ladies will want to sit nearer to me. I always seem to end up slightly on the outside, and the only person I can speak to is Katie, which isn’t great.

       I’m feeling really depressed right now. It’s kinda a combo of being in love, seeing a clip on tv of a fantastic gay lifestyle, feeling really horrible and ugly, you know the thing. You just have these days. So, all my pe exams are now done which is a real great thing. I no longer have to worry about them, may never have to do another bit of physical exercise again in my life. I was saying that last week to Katie and arron, jokingly, but they kinda took it seriously, thinking I’m gonna be some kind of couch potato. Which I rekon put them both off. On Friday I was really showing my depression at school, being quite, stairing into space, that kinda thing. Katie kept asking me what’s wrong, and I aint gonna tell her but I like the fact she asks. It shows someone does actually care about me, even if I don’t care for them much. I really want to tell someone everything. Gemma, is the latest I’ve been considering telling. She seems like the best candidate to keep a big secret and I don’t think she has a problem with gays (can I say that, it’s what I am, and yet it sounds so wrong). I just want to tell someone, female, everything that’s going on with me right now. The problem with Katie, my sexuality, my love interest. On top of all that I’ve got gcse exams coming up in like a month or two and I may soon be moving to Ireland. My life is quite a mess at the moment, and I want someone to share it with. Someone to talk about it with. The more I see gay lifestyles on the telly, the more I want to stop living this lie, leave the closet, come out. If I do move to Northern Ireland, I will seriously consider telling my friends here. Gemma, the Laura’s, Heather, and wouldn’t it be greate if Arron knew too, and it made him come out. Last week there were art exams so our tutor was moved to the textiles room, which I guess was kinda cool. It would’ve been better if I could have stuck with the girls but chris drags me anyway from them. Well, not literally, but, me and chris sit next to each other in tutor. I don’t particularly want to, I want to be with the girls where I belong, but I can’t leave chris on his own, so I’m stuck. Anyway, we were in the textiles room and I got started on reading elle magazine. God it’s good. I want to read more womens magazines, they are so cool. I can’t wait to get my own home and start subscribing to these mags. Gaytimes as well, it’ll be great. I needto stop thinking about the future though, I want to read these magazines now, I want to subscribe today, but I can’t. What would my parents say for a start. Hopefully they would think I’m gay. They certainly don’t right now. Dad’s always insinuating that I’m at that legal age and mum’s always treating me like I don’t know how to choose clothes which go. Seeing Todd’s (coronations street) clothing style the other night reminded me it’s about time I stopped following straight conventional fashion, and start going for something a little more exotic. A little more gay. I need to stop pretending I’m straight for my parents beniefit and just be myself. Read elle with my mum in the room. Were a face mask in front of my dad, run around clothes shops with my sister and friends finding cool new clothes. My dream is that one day I will sit at a table or bench or something and me and my girlfriends will rate the men as they walk past. That is what I’m aiming for. On Friday everyone was encouraging Katie to snog me, which I wasn’t happy about. I don’t want to snog her. I want to actually like the person who I first snog. Hopefully, Laura, who was the one trying to set it up, will have a go at me next week, as that will give me a chance to say I don’t want to kiss her and get a tiny bit of the stuff of my chest. Katie has obviously told Laura she’s want to kiss me, properly, and lauras trying to make it happen. I think I’ve finaly decided what I want to do at sixth form. I’m thinking maths, business, photography, graphics. Two academic subject and two creative. If I had been making this decision last year, I probably would have chosen maths, business, IT, and geography. But after really discovering my gay self I’ve also discovered a more creative side to myself. I now want a job in design. Whether it be fashion, graphic design, photography, interior design, architecture. That’s where I want to go. I think the subjects I’ve chosen reflect this. I’ve also decided I want to go to university. AIU-London looks really cool. They do degrees in all the areas I’ve just mentioned and provided flats in central London. How cool would that be. I’d be living in the middle of London, hopefully with a few girlfriends and be studying, full time, something I love. Sounds great huh?

       God, it's been like a month since I last updated. I just couldn't be bothered lately. Don't know why. So, what's been happenin. Well, I've got one more exam to go, business, before the end of my GCSE's, that's on Monday. I havn't really revised for any of my exams, which probably makes me really stupid. I so should have revised. Oh, well, can't change it now, just have to wait and see what I get. After my graphics exam today, me Amy, Heather and Arron hung around the school for a little while until Heathers mum got there. Then me amy and arron walked off. Amy split away to go home that left just me and him. God, I love him so much. I really do. We were walkin back to his house, because my mum was like on her way, I didn't get inside, cause mum rang just before and said she was here, but I got very close. Just imagine what could have happened if I got further. He is so gay, definatly gay, I just don't think he realises it yet. Which is such a shame, cause he'd make a great boyfriend. Hopefully Gemma will organise some kinda get together over the holidays, otherwise I wont see everyone. I feel pretty good at the moment. Finally I can be myself, the camp self. I can shake my ass when I walk, talking softly and talk openly about my sexuality. What I need to do now, is really develop my personality, cause I thin it's really crap. I want to be closer to all my girlfriends. I need to be about more excitable, more fun and laughy. I need to get lots of new incredibly gay clothes and shoes. I need to get my hair looking a million times better with a bit of dye, and it need a nicer tan. If I feel I'm better looking, I'll feel less stupid getting physicaly close to others. I really am starting not to want to wear make up anymore, I'd rather have darker smother skin - fake tanning seems to be the answer to this. Once I've got a bit of cash I rekon I'll buy some dye and tanner and make myself look a lot better. I really really really need a proper job now, I'm so despirate. I need money, lot's of money to get myself some beautiful new clothes (grands worth I've picked out so far), a nice little retro italian scooter, and an iMac. With those thigs my life would be complete. I just need some damn money. I'm alredy lookin forward to sixth form next year. I'm doing photography, graphics, maths and business. But, I'm now starting to think maybe I should damp maths and go for something a little more interesting/creative. I don't really want to go back next year and do more boring maths, I don't know if I'll be able to stand it. Photographies gonna be great I think, gives me a chance to be artistic. I'm already finding myself coming up with ideas for photographs, and I havn't even started. Can't remember if I said before on here, about a fantastic university in London, I think I did. Anyway, I want to try and slip this idea into conversation with Arron some time. I know he wants or at least wanted to be an interior designer and that's what I'd like to study at AIU-London. If he knew this he might, just might want to come as well. Just imagin me and Arron go off to london share a flat together go to the same university, the same subject. I would love to do this. Arron is such a cool person, and I get on so well with him, who knows what could happen - wink, wink.

       I don't know what it is but I'm just bored of computers now, ever since I came out I just can't be bothered with them there so much hassle. I was laying in bed and was so bored and got to thinkin I hadn't updated in a while and decided to have a go. OK. So. What's been happening well. It's the summer break and I really really need a job. I need to money to fund my expensive taste in shoes and clothes. I would also like to by myself a cute little italien retro scooter - extreamly camp, so I can have some freedom. I would also like to decorate my boudior in suede and faux fur with cappuccino walls and a big fluffy king size bed. And for all of this I need some money. I have applied at the local jam factory and co-op but no one wants me even with all my grade A/B GCSE's! Why why why don't they like me, all I ask for is a little job, friends that work for both of these companies have told me there are job vaccancies, so what's goin on. What I really need to do is ask my dad to hand over the money in my trust fund thing. I'm not supposed to get it until I'm eighteen but why, I need it now, it makes more sence to have it now. With the money, which I think is a good grand and a half I'll get myself a scooter and lessons and a cute little matching helmet. Then i'll be able to look for a job properly, I can go much further affield. Apparently Arron got himself a job at the jam factory as an IT junior. Huh!!! Only the other week he was telling me how he was hopeless at computers. Now, I don't really want a careea in IT but i'd be a damn sight better tham him and I have the GNVQ to proove it, almost. How the hell did he manage to get himself a £40/hour job. I'm soooo jealous of Mr Arron. It's not fair, he just has everything I want, and yet I can't hate him cause I just love him so much. Talking about guys I love, I only saw John Jup earlier today, my primary school heart throb. He was looking absolutly delicious and also v v gay, with his big quiff, blonde/dark hair. I remember one time in year six, there was six of us at the desk including me, katie (not my ex katie, a different one) and john himself. Katie totaly fancied john and so did I, although I don't think I quite realised that made me a total homo, but, anyway, once I looked in katies diary and it said I love john, as teenage girls do, I immediatly, nastely shouted this from the rooftops telling everyone what katie wrote. Lookin back I now realisie I wasn't bothered by the fact that katie liked him, it was kinda like I used katies words to let out my true feelings, kinda like when one says something jokeingly when it is really the truth. I have always been gay since I can remember. I remember one time when we used to go swimming in primary school and the best part was getting to see the other boys 'willies', sorry I just can't use that word, cocks, the other boys cocks. Me and my mum seem to get closer everyday and me and my sister as well. My brother on the other hand hates me more than ever, which is fantastic. Since coming out I've found myself suddenly absolutly adoring Cher which is really cool, I've also sudenly developed I likeing for judy garland and daughter. Oh, shit, I've just realised, I missed Queer Eye. Damn, I love that show so much and that's the second time I've missed it. And I was watching a recording at the time which I could have watched anytime. Gay tv is so important to me right now more than ever. I have no role models around me, I know no gay people, TV is the only place I can see my people. I'm loving will & grace right now as well, and sex and the city, all this gay/gal TV is great. I just got thinking, on my last day of school I got my friends to sign my bye bye book and rekon I should add a few of the comments on here:  Laura B  Hi ya Jon!
