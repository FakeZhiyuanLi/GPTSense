      gEtTing enTertAined bY: walk on the water(CCC youth)   Sometimes when you dun see certain things.. its doesnt mean that its not done. My heart yearns for you to understand, but language is just another mean of barrier between us. U said you know me well. But i'm no longer the young girl i was. I can and will change. I pray that one day u will see who i am inside. Turn back and look, I am no longer who i was. Let me fly. Its always you. You never fail to be the main source of my pain. how i wish things are not this way. i know that you don't mean it. I know you think that you are caring. but somehow i dun feel any consolation. the more you seem to try to understand the more you think of me the wrong way. Please. look at me. don't just see the surface. Look in deep. i am no longer what i was. look at me please. I really pray that the next time i feel hurt, the source is not you but myself. because i don't want to hate you. I rather hate myself. Let me learn. Let me fly. At least i know that if i fall, the next time i'll finally be able to stand by myself. Please look at who i really am and please listen to what i say before you dismiss all my thoughts that you never tried to understand. Please turn and look at me and remember me. Remember my face, know that i've change. I'm so afraid that you will forget the new me and always remember the old past. Daddy Mummy, please look at me. Let me fly. Please.  - *with his love* -

       i decided tt i might as well never write getting entertained by wad le... since i practically entertain myself. i'm juz sho wonderfully interesting. crap. haha. ydae didn go sho bad. thnk God. the scolding was quite short. but 2dae morning was bad. dunno y mama sho bad mood. gt scolded badly.. den cannot tahan cry. i never bargain or talk back to her though. first time. its bcauz i remember Luke 14 says to always take the lowly place and as wad John says... i have to honour my parents. Since they were specially chosen by God to be my parents, i know that i'll be able to go thru all things. Thnk God. :) was really blessed during BS. yay!!!!!!!! laying foundation le. hehe. BS was about fatherhood. in the midst of BS i realised that ever since i bcame a christian, God has really moulded me into a different person. I realised that though my parents couldn't fulfill my emotional needs.. (its partly bcauz i couldn't open up to them myself.) i know my heavenly father can always make me feel significant, self worthy and he always make me feel special. :) 2dae's service was incredible and unbelievable. i couldn't stop crying...i was practically weeping. today, i realised that i'm actually very sensitive to the spirit. when i see people getting touched my God, and when i see their pain. My heart will juz cry for them. Think i cried so much 2dae is partly bcauz of the pain in my heart and the love of God working through me and also a portion goes out to those ppl whose hearts are so deeply burden. but thank God!!!! after 2dae's svc we've all been set free!!!!!!!! Amen? hehe. We are all ppl that break free!!!!!!! Thnk God for God... bcauz without him... i wouldn't be able to go through this day.  -*with his love*-
