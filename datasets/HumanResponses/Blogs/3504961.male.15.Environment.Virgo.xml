        Hippies  are people that have different coloured hairstyles, and are probably vegeterians. They have ribs showing and often have cigarettes in their mouth. They have a bunch of leaflets and are pestering you to take one and give money to various world peace organisations.  Type: Non-Lethal Distactor (Distract:Close) Cost: £6000 Initiative: 180 (V. fast) Health Points: Very Low Armour Points: Very Low Health Damage: Very Low Armour Damage: Very Low Primary Target: Innocents (70%) Secondary Target: Non-Lethal Thugs (30%)  Usefulness: As well as being one of two combat units available when beginning Bushtarion, it's worth noticing land thieves are classified as the innocent. Hippies are practical defence units, stunning Geo-Phys units before they can steal.  Pros: Cheap, good for defending against thieves. Can move fast (ETA: 1). Cons: Physically weak (killed v. easily), need many to affect stronger targets, primary target for Yobs.  Best used: Initial defenses. They are cheap, and will knock out any wheelbarrowers or thieves sent by your opponents. They are also useful for shocking enemies, with an ETA of 1 and the influence of numbers. They are usually the first unit to fire, and few units primarily fire at Non-Lethal Distractors.  TheDeviousDuck Practicality Rating: 8/10

       I am hoping to be able to release a detailed description on popular/common units over the next few weeks, posting one unit per day. I'll make a start today, and anybody can submit their own writing creations to describe units by emailing me at  urlLink snipperworm@hotmail.com .  Let's start writing!

       For a reference, here is the Official Bushtarion Tutorial.  Bushtarion is a browser-based game, where you head up your own company. You can choose one of five different routes: Military, Protestor, Thug, Robotics or Special Operations. You grow different types of plants on your acres: Tree, Bush, Flower or Grass, and go and steal acres from other players.  Before we go any deeper in how to play the game it's recommended that you read several parts in the manual to understand the technicalities of certain game pages. The most important ones now are Overview, Hiring, Maintenance, Supply Depot and Land Management. After you have read these parts, and feel secure about each page and what they do, come back here.  This tutorial is broken into three parts:   Quick Start  - this section is for those who don't want to take the time to learn the in-depth details at this time and are just interested in getting started. It is split in to 4 steps:   * Step 1    * Step 2    * Step 3    * Step 4   What to do Next - this section takes you the next step after you have learned the basics of getting funds. It is split in to 3 sections:   * Purchase Acres    * Purchase Troops    * Begin Researching   After Your First 10 Acres - this section will take you to the next level after you have learned the basics and give you some additional hints and tips. It is split in to a number of areas:   * Researching    * Routes    * Attacking    * Defending    * Combat    * Intelligence    * Alliance   Because there are too many different types of ways to begin the game, only a few ways will be included in the tutorial. There will be additional tips/hints and recommendations that are included as Side Notes.   Please note that unit stats etc. are subject to change (the latest stats can be seen on the Hiring page in the game manual), and so combat report examples below may differ from the time this tutorial was created.        Quick Start (Level I)    Your ultimate goal is to become the number 1 company in Bushtarion before the round ends. In order to do this you need funds to do research (found under Development) and buy troops (found under Hiring) that will allow you to do 2 basic tasks: 1. Attack and steal the acres from other players. 2. Defend your own land and that of your friends/allies.  Your source of income comes from seeds that are produced from the plants planted on your land. To start out with you are given the following: * 5 uncultivated acres * funds of £250,000 * Staff of 150 which consists of 50 Gardeners, 50 Harvesters, 25 Basic Protestors and 25 Basic Thugs * 40 Seeds stocked: 10 of each type of crop  So let's get you started.        Quick Start Step 1    Go to Land Management and you will see that your 5 acres are slated as uncultivated. This is shown under the Land Makeup section in the "Total Acres" column. What this means is since your land is not specified as a specific crop (tree, bush, flower or grass) you will not produce seeds. In order to make progress in Bushtarion this step is required.  Side Note: You will notice that the system will automatically produce 10 seeds per tick of each crop regardless of anything else. This is an "emergency income", so in the worst possible case scenario, you will always have something coming in which you can sell for money to get you started again.   Now you need to make a decision as to the type of land you want. All four land types are balanced, but have different seasonal abilities - for example Bush is an "all-rounder", whereas Flower is a Summer boomer. For the purposes of this tutorial let's select 2 tree acre and 3 bush acres. Under the Prepare Land section put a 2 in the "Amount" box for tree and a 3 in the "Amount" box for bush and click the SUBMIT button. You will notice that the Prepare Land section disappears and in the "Total Acres" column of the Land Makeup section it now shows that you have 2 tree acres and 3 bush acres.        Quick Start Step 2    After allocating your uncultivated land, go to Maintenance. Under the Plantation section you see at the bottom "You have enough land left to plant 360 Trees, 1,080 Bushes, 0 Flowers and 0 Grass." To start the plant growth process so you produce more seeds, you will need to plant plants from your stock. In order to get the plants you will need to grow them first. So look under the Grow Plants section. You will see a number of seeds for each crop. Type in an "a" (without the quotation marks) in the "Amount" box for tree and then do the same for bush and click the MOBILIZE GARDENERS button.  Side Note: Instead of typing in a number like 180, when you type in "a" it will either use what is available or plant the maximum possible.  At the bottom you will see a message like this: "You are currently growing 40 Tree Seeds, 40 Bush Seeds." Let's wait for the end of this tick to see the results.        Quick Start Step 3    You should still be in Maintenance and looking under Plant Plants section. After the tick you will see that you now have some plants in stock. In this scenario there are 39 trees plants and 36 bush plants in stock. Now you want to plant the plants in stock so you will be able to produce more seeds. As you did in step 2 for growing plants, type in an "a" (without the quotation marks) in the "Amount" box for tree and then do the same for bush and click the MOBILIZE GARDENERS button. At the bottom of the Plantation section there is a message like this "You have enough land left to plant 141 Trees, 1,044 Bushes, 0 Flowers and 0 Grass." This is telling you that you need to plant another 141 tree plants and 1,044 bush plants in order to fill up all your acres. Also under the Grow Plants section you see this type of message "You are currently planting 39 Tree Plants, 36 Bush Plants." After the tick has completed, you will then begin to see a lot more seeds show up under the In Stock column in the Grow Plants section. This is because there are now more plants planted on your land, each producing seeds. Continue the same process until the message under Plantation says: "You have enough land left to plant 0 Trees, 0 Bushes, 0 Flowers and 0 Grass."        Quick Start Step 4    If you have excess plants in stock in the Plant Plants section (more plants than you have space to plant on your acres), you can sell these to gain additional funds. Go to Supply Depot and under the Plants section you see a column called "In Storage". Any plants seen in Maintenance are seen here. The selling price is different for different plants - different plants have different values. To sell your plants type in an "a" (without the quotation marks) in the "Sell" box for whichever plant types you wish to sell and then click the SUBMIT button. Your in stock plants will show zero and your funds in the upper left hand corner will automatically increase.       Congratulations!   You now know the basics of getting additional funds. Now that you have filled all your available acres, continue to grow plants under Grow Plants section in Maintenance and sell them in Supply Depot when they show up in the column called "In Stock" under Plant Plants section.        What To Do Next (Level II)    * You can purchase additional acres in Land Management. * You can purchase additional troops in Hiring. * If you have enough funds you can begin researching which is found in Development.        What To Do Next - Purchase Acres    The purchase price of the acres at this stage is very reasonable and it is very common that you purchase additional land in order to increase your funds. With 5 acres in your possession the purchase price of additional land is as follows: * 1 acre will cost you £88,750 * 2 acres will cost you £192,250 * 3 acres will cost you £310,500 * 10 acres will cost you £1,551,250  To complete this step go to Land Management. You will complete this step under Purchase Land section. Decide how many acres you would like to purchase and type the amount in the purchase box and click the PURCHASE button. The funds will be automatically deducted from your total and you will see that you now have uncultivated land again. You will need to make a decision on where you would like to allocate the land. Go to Quick Start - Step 2 for explanation of what needs to be done.  Side Note: If you decide to go this route, make sure you purchase additional gardeners and harvesters. You will need the gardeners to grow plants (move the plants from the seed stage to the plant stage). * 1 gardener can plant 100 seeds. * 1 harvesters gathers 250 seeds. You will need the harvesters to pick seeds. There are other units that can garden or harvest available later in your development stage. The amounts they can plant/harvest can be found in the hiring page in the game manual.  The Harvesters pick the seeds so the gardeners can plant them. A good guideline is to purchase equal amounts until you gain some experience.        What To Do Next - Purchase Troops    Go to Hiring to complete this section. You will only have the option to hire 4 types of staff at this time: Gardeners, Harvesters, Basic Protestors and Basic Thugs. This page shows the description of the unit, the cost of each unit and how many of each unit you currently have employed. If you want to hire 50 Gardeners and 50 Harvesters do the following: * Under the "Hire" column type "50" in the box for Gardeners and tab to the next box. * Under the "Hire" column in the box for Harvesters type "50" and tab to the next box. * Once you tab to the next box, look at the "Cost" box above the ORDER button to see how much this purchase will be. For 50 Gardeners and 50 harvesters the cost will be £260,000. * Once you decide this is what you want to purchase click the ORDER button. Your funds will automatically be deducted and the "Employed" column will change to show 100 Gardeners and 100 Harvesters.  Side Note: In order to see the updated cost of the troops you hire go to the next box. Make sure that you are hiring the correct number of troops before you click on the ORDER button. This saves you from using all your funds at one time or hiring the incorrect number of troops.        What To Do Next - Begin Researching    Go to Development to complete this step.   Side Note: This will not really be an option early in the round. If you look at the cost for some of the research items you can see they are quite expensive compared to what funds you have available. This will be discussed in more detail in the next section. For now try to focus on getting more funds through the process of purchasing additional acres and hiring a good balance of gardeners and harvesters to go along.  Now your funds should be growing faster and faster and you will need to balance your gardeners and harvesters. JUST remember that each plant gives a maximum amount of seeds and if you do not have enough harvesters you will not get the maximum amount. What this means is that as you increase your acres you need to increase the amount of harvesters to try and find that "perfect" ratio.  Side Note: This is one of those areas that you will need to try and figure out for yourself.       Congratulations!   You have successfully completed the next level. Hopefully you are working on figuring the right balance of gardeners and harvesters that you need to maximize the amount of seeds you can produce. As always please read the manual and view the threads under the forums, as there is a significant amount of help available to you.  Side Note: Now that you understand the basics a little better it might be a good idea to read through the FAQ's and go onto the forums to read some of the help threads.        After Your First 10 Acres (Level III)         Researching    You should have enough funds now to begin researching and you should be thinking about what route you would like to try. To begin researching go to Development and you will see several options available: * Research column - tells you the units that are available at this time to research. As you complete each unit there will be more options available. * Time column - time (number of ticks) it takes to complete the research. As each unit becomes complete you will notice that the time will increase on units further into the "Tech Tree".  * Cost column - tells you how many funds are needed to complete the research. As each unit becomes complete you will notice the amount of funds will increase on units further into the "Tech Tree". * Completed column - if the research is available it will say "Research". If the research has been completed it will say "Complete." If the research is in process it will say "Researching". Once you have started a research you cannot start another one under the Research section.  Side Note: You really have 7 choices in how you want to get started here. * The Geo-Physics option will allow you to get the Geo-Phys Thief units, which enables you to steal land. You will still need to complete another research step that falls under the Research section before the units are available to hire. * The Placards and Pamphlets option is the start of the Protestor route. If you start researching this all the other routes will be disabled. Once research is complete this will enable the Protestor Guru unit. * The Rioting and General Disorder option is the start of the Thug route. If you start researching this all the other routes will be disabled. Once research is complete this will enable the Hooligan unit. * The Engineering option needs to wait until later as you can see it takes quite a lot of funds to get started. This will allow you at a minimum to get the tractor and combine harvester units. Please note that some players may want to choose this route first and that is fine. The choice is yours. * The Basic Robotics option is the start of the Robotics route. If you start researching this all the other routes will be disabled. Once research is complete this will enable the Small Droid unit. * The Simple Traps option is the start of the Special Operations route. If you start researching this all the other routes will be disabled. Once research is complete this will enable the Sleeping Gas Trap unit. * The Training Camp option is located under the Construct section and will enable the Private unit once the construction is complete. This is the start of the Military route.  Make sure you read the Manual and look over the Tech Tree before making a final decision on the route you want to choose.        Geo-Phys Thieves-Researching    Let's walk through the Geo-Phys research.   1. Go to Development. Under the "Completed" column select the word "Research" for the Geo-Physics option.  2. Go to Overview and look under the section called Researching. You will see a message that looks like this: "You are currently researching 'Geo-Physics', 8% complete, finished in 11 ticks."  This is the message that you will see after one tick has passed. This tells you how many ticks are remaining before this development is complete. Once the research is complete the Researching section will disappear. 3. Go to News. You will see a message like this for when you start and finish the research: Start Research = "Thu, 14th May, year 5. Morning time -- Research Started -  You started to research 'Geo-Physics', it will be complete in 12 ticks."  Finish Research = "Sat, 16th May, year 5. Morning time -- Research Complete -  You have finished your latest research." 4. Now that the research is complete, go to Development again. Under the completed column you will see "Complete" for Geo-Physics which indicates you are done. You will also notice that another development item has appeared called "Geo-Phys Thieves". As indicated above this is the second step that needs to be completed before the units are actually available for hiring. This research item is a bit more expensive than the first one.  Side Note: As you are waiting for your research to complete it is a good idea to conserve your funds for the next development stage. Actually this is a good rule of thumb to use throughout the round. It is always good to have some funds saved for many situations.  5. Stay in Development so the second part of the Geo-Physics research can begin. Under the "Completed" column select the word "Research" for the Geo-Phys Thieves option. 6. Go to Overview and look under the section called Researching. You will see a message that looks like this: "You are currently researching 'Geo-Phys Thieves', 0% complete, finished in 20 ticks. "  This is the message that you will see once you have started the research. Again, this tells you how many ticks are remaining before this development is complete. Once the research is complete the Researching section will disappear. 7. Now that the research is complete go to Hiring. You now see one of the available troops to hire is Geo-Phys Thief. 8. Now go back to Development and start another research item.        Routes    For this tutorial I will choose the Military route. Go to Development again and look under the Construct section. Under the "Completed" column select Construct for Training Camp. Go to Overview and you will see under the Constructing section this message after one tick has passed: "You are currently constructing 'Training Camp', 4% complete, finished in 23 ticks."  Now that Training Camp is complete go to Hiring and you will see that Private is now available for hiring. Now go back to Development and you will see that the other options available for Protestors, Thugs, Robotics and Special Operations routes have now disappeared. The next item available is Military Training that gives you the Officer unit. To research these units go through the same process as was completed for the Private unit.  Now that Military Training is complete go to Hiring and you will see that Officer is now available for hiring. Go back to Development and you will see that you now have 2 more options to choose from. In reviewing the Tech Tree you will see that there is a split at this point. You again have to make a decision as to what side of the Military Tech Tree you want to go down. The Heavy Weapons Research will produce units with firepower. The Shock tactics will produce units that enable rapid troop deployment. What this means is that you need to decide if you want to be quicker mobs with less armour and firepower or slower mobs with more armour and firepower.  Side Note: Take note in the "Time" and "Cost" column. To start the Heavy Weapons Research you will need funds of £60,000,000,000 or £45,000,000,000 funds for Shock Tactics research. Since this will take quite a bit to get started now is the time to work on gaining more land to increase your funds. Once you are able to get those funds, the research for Heavy Weapons will take 132 ticks and for Shock Tactics it will take 126 ticks. You can also use that time to try and get enough funds to research the next item.  For purposes of this tutorial I will choose the Heavy Weapons Research. In Development again look under the Research section. Under the "Completed" column select Research for Heavy Weapons Research. Go to Overview and you will see under the Researching section this message: " You are currently researching 'Heavy Weapons Research', 0% complete, finished in 132 ticks."  Now that Heavy Weapons Research is complete go to Hiring and you will see that Heavy Weapons Soldier is now available for hiring. Go back to Development and you will see that Grenade Designs option is now available for research. Once this research is completed you will see the Grenadier unit become available for hiring. In looking under Development now you will see the only option available to research is Engineering. This will need to be completed in order to open the remaining units for construction. Under the "Completed" column select Research for Engineering.  Go back to Development and you will see 3 additional items under the Construct section: Striker Factory, Combine Harvester Factory and Tractor Factory. * Completion of the Striker Factory enables the Striker unit and now allows the Helicopter Pads research under the Construct section. * Completion of Helicopter Pads research enables the Apache Longbow unit and now allows the Stealth Camouflage research option under the Research section. You will notice that under the "Completed" column for this option it shows "Purchase Blueprints". Once you click on this the Purchase Technology Blueprints section under Purchase automatically comes up. The cost for this option is £10.00 GBP. Once you purchase the blueprints you will still need to go through the research to enable the unit. * Completion of the Stealth Camouflage research enables the Marine unit. * Completion of the Combine Harvester Factory enables the Combine Harvester unit. * Completion of the Tractor Factory enables the Tractor unit.  Side Note: This tutorial has taken you through one option under the Military route. You will not necessarily be able to complete the research and/or construct steps as quickly as this tutorial shows you. You will need to save funds in between each step and even after as you can see the amount of funds needed. The above examples are to show you how to complete the research. Make sure you review the Tech Tree and read the Manual to understand about the different units within each route.        Attacking    You shouldn't be launching your first attack until you have hired the Geo-Phys Thieves so you can steal some land from another target. There are 3 basic things to remember about attacking.  * You cannot attack someone who has less than 10 acres. This is the message you get if you attack someone with less than 10 land: "The target does not have more than 10 land" * You cannot attack someone who is less than 17.5% of your score. Take your score and multiply it times .175 to come up with the lowest score you can attack.  * You cannot attack someone who is sleep mode. You know this if they have the brackets { } around their rank, ID, owner name and company name.  To attack someone you need to first identify a target. You do this by searching for a target. Let's go through how this is done.  1. Go to Search. 2. For this example your score = 2,224,913. Take this number by .175 and you get 389,360. So this is the lowest score you can attack. 3. If you look there are several options available for searching. In this example we will search by score. In the box for "Where score is equal to or more than" put 389360. If you now click the SEARCH button you will get a significant amount of targets to choose from including those that are a lot bigger than you. As a recommendation let's use another number to put in the box for "Where score is equal to or less than". For this example take 2,224,913 times 25% or .25 and you get 556228. Put that number in the second box and click on the SEARCH button. 4. This should give you a much easier list to work from. It is recommended that you print this list off because once you select another option in the game you will lose the list. For this example we will choose this target:  Rank ID Owner Company Acres Score  1252 1555 Scant Industrial_Salvage 130 393,380 5. Having gathered your list of targets you now need to scan the target to see if it makes sense to attack. The types of scans are explained in more detail in the Intelligence section below. 6. If this is a good target you now need to go to Military and look under the Staff-Mobilise section. 7. The "Send" column is where you put the number of troops you would like to use to attack the target you have identified. Go through each type of troop and put the amount in the applicable box under the "Send:" column. Each type of troop has an "ETA" which means this is how many ticks it will take to reach the identified target. For your Gardeners and Harvesters it will take 2 ticks to reach your target.  8. Once #7 is completed go to the Target section. The left-hand box is called a drop-down box that has 2 options: Attack or Defend. The default is always attack. So you don't need to do anything with this box. The right-hand box is where you put your targets ID. Once you have put in your target ID click the SEND button. 9. At the top of the Staff-Mobilise section you will see a message like this:" Mob sent to Tutorial of Bushtarion [123]" 10. Go to Overview and look under the Outgoing section and you will see a message:  560 staff approaching Tutorial of Bushtarion [123] eta 2. Attacking. 11. Once your troops land and attack you will receive a battle report that can be viewed through News. The report will summarise the events that took place.        Adrenaline Rush    Adrenaline rush is used to attack an enemy larger than you. Your men will scream all manners of things and charge in to battle, knowing they are going up against a larger force. This adrenaline burst will give them an instant boost to their outgoing ETA - up to 2 ETA knocked off their total ETA (taking the ETA down to a minimum of 1). If the target is 6 times your score, you get 1 less ETA. If the target is 12 times your score, you get 2 less ETA total. Your ETA can be reduced to a minimum of 1 ETA. This is not in effect in recalling, only launching.   Let's walk through this. Go to Military and look under the Target section. As you have done in the Attacking section above put your target ID in the right-hand box. You do not need to do anything with the left-hand box, as the default is "Attack". Then right below you must check the "Adrenaline Rush" box before you launch, otherwise the ETA will be as normal. Once you have completed all that click the SEND button and at the top of the Staff-Mobilise section you will see a message like this:  "Mob sent to Tutorial of Bushtarion [123] Mob has rampaged nearer through adrenaline and rage due to the sheer size of the target."        Defending    Unless you are in an alliance you probably won't deal with a lot of defending unless you have a friend that asks for your help. The process for launching your troops to defend is the same as you have done for attacking with one exception:  Go to Military and look under the Target section. In the left-hand box you will need to select "Defend" instead of "Attack".  You will receive battle reports when you defend someone. If your troops stay through all 3 ticks, then you will receive 3 battle reports. The following is a battle report you get if you defend and there are no attackers at the target.   Defenders Battle Report - Defending Tutorial of Bushtarion [123]  Fortunately we remembered to bring the kettle with us, since we didn't have a lot else to do.  The following is what a battle report looks like if there were actual attackers at the target.  Defenders Battle Report - Defending Tutorial of Bushtarion [123]  [range] 9,988,529 allied Terrorist attacked and killed 18,893,098 hostile staff. [range] 882,320 hostile Terrorist attacked and killed 2,200,800 allied staff. [range] 898,545 hostile Hippy Van attacked and distracted 1,038,796 allied staff. [range] 349,304 hostile Loudspeaker Protestor attacked and distracted 1,064,600 allied staff. [range] 4,964,482 allied Private attacked and killed 2,043,450 hostile staff. [range] 1,874 hostile Private attacked and killed 2,471 allied staff. Deaths: 2,203,271 friendly deaths. 20,936,548 enemy deaths.   There is a benefit to being in an alliance when you are defending someone. To explain this go to Military and look under the Staff-Mobilise section. You will notice an "ETA" column for each type of staff you have available. This is the amount of time or number of ticks it takes to reach your target if you are defending a non-alliance target. So if you send 100 Officer units to defend a non-alliance target, it will take ETA 5 or 5 ticks before it reaches that target. Assuming the same target is in your alliance, it will take ETA 4 or 4 ticks before it reaches the target. This is one benefit to being in an alliance.  Here is how the ticks work when you are defending or attacking:  Example: At 10:55 GMT you sent troops to defend a friend with an ETA of 5. So you will see the following messages show up under the Outgoing section of Overview. As you can see after each tick (10 minutes) the eta changes. Your troops will not see any battle when they go from the "Eta 1 defending stage" to "Defending for 3 ticks" stage. The first tick of battle will occur when they go from "Defending for 3 ticks" to "Defending for 2 ticks".  Approaching At 10:55 GMT xxxx staff approaching Tutorial of Bushtarion [123] eta 5 Defending At 11:01 GMT xxxx staff approaching Tutorial of Bushtarion [123] eta 4 Defending At 11:11 GMT xxxx staff approaching Tutorial of Bushtarion [123] eta 3 Defending At 11:21 GMT xxxx staff approaching Tutorial of Bushtarion [123] eta 2 Defending At 11:31 GMT xxxx staff approaching Tutorial of Bushtarion [123] eta 1 Defending At Target At 11:41 GMT xxxx staff at Tutorial of Bushtarion [123] Defending for 3 ticks At 11:51 GMT xxxx staff at Tutorial of Bushtarion [123] Defending for 2 ticks (First battle report) At 12:01 GMT xxxx staff at Tutorial of Bushtarion [123] Defending for 1 ticks (Second battle report) Returning At 12:11 GMT xxxx staff returning from Tutorial of Bushtarion [123] eta 5 (Third battle report) At 12:21 GMT xxxx staff returning from Tutorial of Bushtarion [123] eta 4 At 12:31 GMT xxxx staff returning from Tutorial of Bushtarion [123] eta 3 At 12:41 GMT xxxx staff returning from Tutorial of Bushtarion [123] eta 2 At 12:51 GMT xxxx staff returning from Tutorial of Bushtarion [123] eta 1  At 13:01 GMT your staff will be back at your base ready for another attack or defense.        Combat    As part of this tutorial combat and targeting will be explained in some depth to help you understand some of the details involved. There is no way all aspects can be covered, as there are too many scenarios. You can take what you learn and apply it to your own experiences throughout the round.    Basic Explanations:  If you do not see a particular unit fire in reviewing the battle report it could be related to 5 areas:  * Your unit has been eliminated before it has had a chance to fire. * Your unit has been distracted by another unit before it has had a chance to fire. * Your unit has been disabled by another unit before it has had a chance to fire. * There are no targets available for your unit to fire at. * Your unit has been bribed by another unit before it has had a chance to fire.  A unit will fire based on the Init (Initiative) assigned to it. Review Hiring for the assigned Init of each unit. The lower the initiative, the quicker the unit will fire in battle. As an example unit A has an initiative of 80 and unit B has an initiative of 140. Unit A will fire before unit B.  Each unit is assigned a Class. * LET or lethal will kill other units based on their target class. * NLT or Non Lethal Thug will disable other units based on their target class. * NLD or Non Lethal Distractor will distract other units based on their target class. * INN or Innocents are units that harvest, garden, steal land, or destroy seeds. They cause no harm to other units.  With the exception of INN, each unit has been assigned a Target Class. A unit can have as few as one target class or as many as three target classes. The units will target one of the assigned classes listed above. * T-1 or Primary target class tells the unit that when you go into battle this will be the type of target you look for first. * T-2 or Secondary target class tells the unit that when you go into battle this will be the type of target you look for after the primary target. * T-3 or Tertiary target class tells the unit that when you go into battle this will be the type of target you look for after the secondary target.  Now let's take the Target Class a step further.  1. If your unit only has a primary target then when you go into battle all your units will fire at the primary target. As an example let's look at the Striker unit. When the Striker goes into battle it will have all available units fire at lethals because this is their primary target. If there are no available lethals, then the Strikers do not fire because there are no available targets. 2. If your unit has a primary and secondary target then when you go into battle the possible scenarios below could occur. As an example let's look at the Terrorist unit, which has a primary target (INN) and a secondary target (LETH).   * The Terrorist enters the battle for the 1st tick and sees available INN and LET targets. Because INN is the primary target, about 70% of the available Terrorist units will fire at the INN. The other 30% will fire at the available LET targets.   * The Terrorist enters the battle for the 2nd tick and only sees available LETH targets. Because INN are the primary target and non are available, 70% of the available Terrorist units will not fire. The other 30% will fire at the available LET targets.   * The Terrorists enters the battle for the 3rd tick and sees no available targets. 100% of the available Terrorist units will no fire. 3. If your unit has a primary, secondary and tertiary target then you can use the same process in #2. What is different is that about 50% of your units will fire at the primary target, 35% will fire at the secondary target and 15% will fire at the tertiary target. If there are no primary or secondary targets available, then 15% of your available units will fire at the tertiary target.  Each unit is assigned a Type:  * All - this indicates that the unit will fire during all 3 ticks of the battle as long as there are available targets. Some examples of units are Assassin, Crazed Droid, Officer and Striker. * Range - this indicates that the unit will fire during the 1st and 2nd ticks of the battle as long as there are available targets. Some examples of units are Automoton, Ninja, Petrol Bomber, and Terrorist Leader. * Close - this indicates that the unit will only fire during the 3rd tick of the battle as long as there are available targets. Some examples of units are Basic Protestor, Heavy Thug, Monster Truck and Small Droid.  Each unit is assigned characteristics such as health points, health damage, armour and armour damage. A generalised rating (to be used as a guideline) for each of these units ranges from a low of 1 to a high of 6, and can be found on the Hiring page in the game manual. As an example the Apache Longbow unit has the following ratings: * HP (Health Point) = 1 * AR (Armour) = 6 * HD (Health Damage) = 1 * AD (Armour Damage) = 6   Battle Example:  This next step you will be taken through some battle reports to have questions answered on why certain scenarios occur. This is only one battle and is here to help you understand how to read the battle report. It is recommended that you have a copy of the Hiring page from the manual. This will be much easier when reviewing the information below.  This is the mob that was sent to attack ID 14. Below the Haxor of ID 14 is also included. Gardener 5,000  Private 500  Officer 500  Heavy Weapons Soldier 500  Grenadier 750  Striker 500  Apache Longbow 750  Marine 750  Geo-Phys Thief 750  System hack on Ned of Neptune [14] results: Gardener [5,000] Harvester [0] Combine Harvester [0] Tractor [0] Basic Protestor [5,000] Basic Thug [0]  Geo-Phys Thief [0] GM Harvester [0] Bunker [1,000] Cloner [1,000]   After the first tick you will receive a battle report describing what happened.   Attackers Battle Report - Attacking Ned of Neptune [14] [range] 1,000 hostile Bunker attacked and killed 6,063 allied staff. [range] 483 allied Striker attacked and killed 1,270 hostile staff. [range] 182 allied Grenadier attacked and killed 291 hostile staff. [range] 1,157 hostile Ninja attacked and killed 587 allied staff. [range] 726 allied Apache Longbow attacked and killed 787 hostile staff. [range] 198 allied Heavy Weapons Soldier attacked and killed 397 hostile staff. [range] 445 allied Marine attacked and killed 461 hostile staff. [range] 143 allied Officer attacked and killed 110 hostile staff. Deaths: 6,650 friendly deaths. 3,316 enemy deaths.   1. The first unit to attack is the Bunker. This is because out of all the units at the battle site the Init for this unit is the lowest. This tells you that all 1,000 units were available to attack and killed 6,063 other units. 2. The 2nd unit to fire is the Striker with an Init of 170. In the initial mob that was sent there were a total of 500 Striker units. What this tells you is that 7 Strikers were killed by the Bunker unit before they could fire. What this also tells you is that there were LETH units available to fire at as this is the only target for the Strikers. 3. The 3rd unit to fire is the Grenadier with an Init of 220. In the initial mob that was sent there were a total of 750 Grenadier units. Because you only see 182 units attacking, this indicates that 567 Grenadiers were killed by the Bunker unit before they could fire.  4. The 4th unit to fire is the Ninja with an Init of 230. If you take a close look at the Haxor above you will see no indication of this unit. If you look on the Hiring page from the manual you will notice that this unit is an S Flag. This indicates stealth capabilities so it will not show up when you complete a Haxor. 5. After the Ninja unit there are 4 more units that fire in order of their Init. Apache Longbow = 270, Heavy Weapons Soldier = 330, Marine = 390 and Officer = 510.  6. One unit from the attacker did not show up and that is the Private with an Init of 490. If you look at the Hiring page very closely you will notice that the Private unit is assigned the Type of close. Again this tells you this unit only fires during the 3rd tick of the battle. There are 3 units from ID 14 that also did not fire and they are the Basic Protestor, Cloner and Sleeping Gas Trap units. These units are also assigned the Type of close.  Again you will receive a battle report after second tick:  Attackers Battle Report - Attacking Ned of Neptune [14] [range] 848 hostile Bunker attacked and killed 1,547 allied staff. [range] 448 allied Striker attacked and killed 895 hostile staff. [range] 171 hostile Ninja attacked and killed 15 allied staff. [range] 691 allied Apache Longbow attacked and killed 713 hostile staff. [range] 35 allied Heavy Weapons Soldier attacked and killed 37 hostile staff. [range] 188 allied Marine attacked and killed 144 hostile staff. Deaths: 1,562 friendly deaths. 1,789 enemy deaths.   During the 1st tick there were 8 different units that fired, but for the 2nd tick you can see that there are only 6 units that fire. You already know that 4 of the units are assigned the Type of close so they will not fire this tick. The 2 units that do not show up are the Grenadier and the Officer. If you look at the top under Basic Explanations you see 5 reasons why a unit will not fire and 4 of them do not fir this scenario. So that means these 2 units have been killed before they had a chance to fire during the 2nd tick.   Here is the final battle report which happens after the 3rd tick.  Attackers Battle Report - Attacking Ned of Neptune [14]  [close] 569 hostile Bunker attacked and killed 381 allied staff. [close] 4,874 hostile Basic Protestor attacked and distracted 259 allied staff. [close] 781 hostile Sleeping Gas Trap attacked and disabled 71 allied staff. [close] 416 allied Striker attacked and killed 243 hostile staff. [close] 656 allied Apache Longbow attacked and killed 662 hostile staff. [close] 72 allied Marine attacked and killed 45 hostile staff. [close] 5 allied Heavy Weapons Soldier attacked and killed 2 hostile staff. Deaths: 381 friendly deaths. 952 enemy deaths.   What you should notice in this report is that there are 2 units assigned the Type of close that did not fire during the first 2 ranged ticks - the Basic Protestor and the Sleeping Gas Trap. Also we see that a unit that was not in the originally Hax0r is visible and active - again the Sleeping Gas Trap unit. This is because the Sleeping Gas Trap unit is a "Stealth" unit, and so not visible in Hax0rs. Notice that the Cloner unit did not fire once - this can be attributed to the fact the unit was most likely entirely wiped out before it had a chance to fire.  Attacker Units at beginning of battle = 10,000 Units remaining after the battle = 1,408 Gardener 0  Private 0  Officer 0  Heavy Weapons Soldier 5  Grenadier 0  Striker 416  Apache Longbow 656  Marine 72  Geo-Phys Thief 259  Defender Units at beginning of battle = 13,000 Units remaining after the battle = 8,947 System hack on Ned of Neptune [14] results:  Gardener [3,103] Harvester [0]  Combine Harvester [0] Tractor [0]  Basic Protestor [4,866] Basic Thug [0]  Geo-Phys Thief [0] GM Harvester [0]  Bunker [197] Cloner [0]        Intelligence    The Manual has a section on Intelligence so it would be good to look through that before exploring this option. Basically this is where you where you can gather information on other players in the game. There are 4 different types of intelligence you can gather:  * Drive by Gives you the land type and the amount of land that particular company has. * Haxor Gives you the amount of staff and the kind of troops that the company has along with the plant storage and the seed storage.  Side Note: This is a good way of telling if someone is online. During sunny weather you can use one of these scans to see if a potential target has planted their seeds. Also this is the scan you use to plan an attack and defense. If you have incoming, you can complete a Haxor to see what type of troops are going to land on your base or someone elses.  * Fly Over This shows you the type and amount of land and how much of that land is full.  * Spy If you do a spy report on another company it will show a detailed report of everything that the particular company has been doing, who they are attacking / defending, ho much, if any, defense they receive. From this you can usually work out if they are in an alliance by checking to see if they receive a lot of defense from the same people. If you see them receiving government help you have triggered the anti rape and this shows they are solo. More information on anti-rape can be found on the anti-rape page.   Side Note: This is a very important scan to use when attacking and defending. It is very important to check your target to see if they have received any defense. At a minimum you need to start checking when your mob is 3 ticks from reaching your target. One other important time to complete this scan is when your mob goes from an eta 1 to a status of "There for 3 ticks". This is to identify if the target is classed as solo. You will see if they have received government defense. Two of the messages you might see is as follows:  "Government incoming defences Huge strange aircraft hovered above our company, then all of a sudden, strange lights flickered on our land and 7,335,364 bio-mechanical warriors appeared."  "Government incoming defences Helicopters flew in overhead, dropping lines down around our land. Figures dressed in black, faces covered with balaclavas, dropped down the lines, assault rifles strapped to their backs. We couldn't be sure how many just yet"  If you see these I would recommend that you return from attacking. If you don't you can expect your mob to incur heavy losses.        Alliance    In order to start an alliance you first need to create a name. Go to the Create Alliance section in Preferences. In the box for "Create Tag" put your alliance name. Tab to the next box and put a "Tag password" that other players will need in order to join your alliance. Make sure you remember this password. Then click the SUBMIT button. Once you have completed this you will notice a new option available to you called Maintain Alliance. This is basically the control room as the Leader of the alliance.  * To set your alliance taxes, go to the Set Alliance Income Taxes section. There is a box there where you input the new tax rate. Once you do this click the SUBMIT button located in the Public Displayed Alliance? section. Under the Alliance Info section at the top you will see that your Income Tax has now been changed. Once the alliance members start selling their plants in storage, the alliance funds will start to increase. * Once some players have joined your alliance you can set positions under the Set Positions section. There are 3 boxes available. One for the Military Officer, one for the Communications Officer, and one for the Leader. Just put the players ID's in the corresponding box and click the SUBMIT button located in the Public Displayed Alliance? section. As noted above there is a box available for a Leader ID. Just below where you would put the new Leader ID, there is a check box that you would check if you are going to change leadership of the alliance. * The available HQ buildings will show up under the Alliance Constructions section. The very first construction that needs to be completed is the "Empty Land". When the alliance funds under the Alliance Info section equals or is greater than £175,000,000,000, you can proceed with the construction. * Under the Public Displayed Alliance section you can specify whether your alliance is public or private. If you select private no one outside your alliance can see who is in your alliance. Under the Alliance Info section you can see if your alliance is specified as public or private. In order for your alliance to show as public you will need more than 1 alliance member. * The Change Alliance Password section is self-explanatory. A recommendation for the leader of an alliance is to change the password quite frequently.   The first item to construct as shown under the Alliance Constructions section of Maintain Alliance is Empty Land. You must have the funds available shown under the Alliance Info section before you can start the construction. Once you start you will see a message like this: "Constructing, 0% complete, ETA 6." under the "Completed" column. Once the construction is complete you will see that your alliance now has an ID as shown in the Alliance Info section. It will say: Alliance HQ Details: Targettable ID: 100001 The ID listed is just for purposes of this tutorial.  Now if you look you will see the next available item to construct is Basic HQ Buildings. Once this is complete you will see 4 additional options available:  * Mess Hall - this option enables the Dog Training Facilities and Armoury. * Barracks - this option enables the Office Quarters and the factories. * Sandbag Bunkers - this option will enable both the sandbag and concrete gun nests and bunkers. * Barbed Wire Boundary - this option will take you down the path to getting the High Intensity Search Lights. Once the construction is complete on the search lights you will see Incoming mobs detected at close proximity change from (ETA 3 or less) to (ETA 5 or less).   As certain alliance HQ items are constructed another section will show up under Maintain Alliance. This is the Alliance HQ Army section. This is where you will hire your army for the HQ.  Side Note: The key for the alliances is to get the High-Intensity Search-Lights as quickly as possible. This will allow your alliance to see any incoming at an ETA of 5 or less. This makes it much easier to defend. Also make sure you review the Tech Tree for HQ Development. There are certain buildings that need to be completed in order to enable certain other buildings. As an example: Before you can construct the Tank Factory, you must first construct the Armory, Concrete Walls and Inner Boundary and Office Quarters.         Final Note    There is a lot more to the game than what is included in this tutorial. This is only meant to be a way to help new players get going more quickly by learning the basics. There are too many strategies and ways to play the game to include in this short format.
