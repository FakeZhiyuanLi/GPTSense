      I don't want to get all political, but there is one thing that needs to be said about the Republican party. How is it alright to unjustly send our young soldiers into war and for them to die fighting in that war, but not alright to kill an unborn fetus? How is it alright to kill a mentally retarded person who commits murder, but not alright to kill an unborn fetus? Isn't it an oxymoron to say you are "pro-life" and "pro-gun". The whole purpose of a gun is to kill, which, as I understand, would be the complete opposite of pro-life. Can you say "anti-life"! What amazes me even more is that all of this craziness is based on some crazy philosophical mumbojumbo. My stance on all the afore mentioned situations is that war should not be started unless there is credible evidence supporting it from people other than those wanting control of the country in question; I am completely pro-choice; I am anti-capital punishment for the reason that I beleive it is far worse of a punishment for someone to rot in prison for the rest of their life than for them to be put to death; and finally I am fully anti-gun. This whole thing is very flawed and I know that, it's just my opinion.      "The question is not whether we will die, but how we will live."   -Joan Borysenko

      I'm so scared that the way that I feel,Is written all over my face,When you walk into the room I wanna find a hiding place,We used to laugh, we used to hug,The way that old friends do,But now a smile and a touch of your hand,Just make me come unglued,It's such a contradiction, do I lie or tell the truth,Is it fact or fiction the way I feel for you. It's so complicated, I'm so frustrated,I wanna hold you close, I wanna push you away,I wanna make you go, I wanna make you stay,Should I say it, should I tell you how I feel,Oh, I want you to know,But then again I don't,It's so complicated. Just when I think I'm under control,I think I finally got a grip,Another friend tells me that,My name is always on your lips,They say I'm more than just a friend,They say I must be blind,Well I admit that I've seen you watch me,From the corner of your eye,Oh it's so confusing I wish you'd just confess,But think of what I'd be losing,If your answer wasn't yes. It's so complicated, I'm so frustrated,I wanna hold you close, I wanna push you away,I wanna make you go, I wanna make you stay,Should I say it, should I tell you how I feel,Oh, I want you to know,But then again I don't,It's so complicated. I hate it 'cause I've waited so long for someone like you,Should I say it,Should I tell you how I feel,Oh I want you to know,But then again I don't,It's so complicated.

      It's 11:30 pm on a Wednesday in August and I am sitting at my computer contemplating what to right. I guess I should write that this is my first entry into this blog in which I have no idea why I writing in it. Oh well, I guess things could be worse. I could be completely drunk and have no idea what I was writing. That would definitely be worse than not knowing why I'm writing. Which reminds me... I'm just joking for all those concerned or I am... Life is good at the moment, things could change though. Sleep is good and that's what I'm gonna do. I have to go play golf tomorrow and need all the sleep I can get.   "The doors we open and close each day decide the lives we live." -Flora Whittemore
