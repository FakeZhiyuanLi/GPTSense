      I actually had fun at the wedding. My dad introduced me to all the people he works with and I heard a lot of stories about my dad and what my dad tells them about me. lol It was rather interesting. Then jokingly I asked my dad to get me a glass of wine, well I didn't think he would, but to my surprise when he came back he had the big glass of wine...Well, as the reception went on these waiter guys kept coming around to fill up the glass...I really didn't notice them doing it, they just sorta did it when I wasn't looking. Well after 3 big glasses of wine and 2 glasses of champain...I got a little tipsy...My dad and his work buddies were laughing at me because I was stumbling around and had trouble keeping my head up...and yeah...Now the whole point of me being there was to talk to a recruiter from Westpoint. Well...when I talked to him it didn't work out to well. I couldn't concentrate on what he was saying...Instead of concentrating on what he was saying...I was concentrating on standing...lol it was great...I'm sure I made such a good impression on him lol...Well, when I got home I had no trouble sleeping...I KNOCKED OUT!!! We got home at 5 and I woke up at 11 only because my damn cell phone was ringing off the wall...O well, still had a good nap, I know if my cell didn't ring I could have slept until tomorrow morning...o well...tomorrow should be fun, we got a swim party for church and Juan might go. O well, I'm gonna go...Catch yall later!

      Well, Recently I haven't been getting a lot of sleep. For the last week they have been working on our ditch outside and they have some machine out there that runs all night long. Due to the fact that its loud it prevents me from sleeping. In fact last night after my last post I laid in bed and tossed and turned until 9am when I finally got out of bed. THIS THING IS DRIVING MY CRAZY! Now I cant go to sleep at all because we have a wedding to go to in about and hour. O well, hopefully we will leave right after the thing and not go to the reception. I really need some sleep. I hate not being able to sleep.   On to a new subject...For the past few weeks my internet in my room hasn't been working and we have tried and tried to figure out what was wrong with the damn thing! We bought a new Ethernet Card for it and took it to a computer place and nothing would seem to work...Well at 9 a computer guy from SBC came over (that's why I had to get up) and he told us that it was the damn portal. We would have never figured that shit out. We would still probably be looking for the damn thing if he hadn't come out. O well, the fact is the computer in my room is working now...and that makes me a happy person. :) Well, I got to go start to get ready for the stupid Wedding, catch yall later!

      Well, after debating about it for several days I finally decided to get me one of these things. Although it isn't live journal like the rest of my friends I still got one! This is where my thoughts will go about what happened during the course of my day. I have a feeling I may piss some people off as the weeks go by but o well, I don't care.  Well today, or sense its rather late it would be yesterday, I didn't end up going to sleep until around 8 or 9 in the mourning. I just couldn't sleep. I tried going to sleep around 1 and for some reason I just kept tossing and turning. Well after I finally got to sleep the phone rang and woke me up...and once again...I couldn't go back to sleep...So I got my ass out of bed and cooked me some food. Around 6 my parents and I picked up Juan and we all went to Specs liquor...Very cool store, went to best buy and then to Wings and More. At WAM we watched the Astro's game. That's another thing...WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE ASTROS?!?! We need better pitching. I have been an Astros fan all my life and I will always be an Astros fan...but geeze guys...Get out of your slump and start winning some games! O -well. When I got home from taking Juan home I saw this thing about that new Movie Fahrenheit 9/11. Now that shit really pisses me off. All these damn liberal media people never give Bush any credit. All I ever hear when I turn on the news is Bush bashing! That damn movie makes the creator of the film look stupid because all the stuff he uses in there is all spliced together to make him look bad! IT MAKES NO SENSE! I hate the fucking Demanazies...O-well...Back to sports...t.u is in the college World Series...I hate the fact that they made it that far. Many people think I should go for them just because they are from Texas...but no...I hope the lose, even though they will probably win. I will give them some credit and say they do have a good team. O well, A&M did pretty good this year with their baseball team, but they ended up losing to LSU in the Super Regionals...o well, good year for them. Well, now that I have bored all of yall with my rambling, I think I will go now. Talk to yall later!

      Today after church we had a swim party at one of them members house. That was a lot of fun. I haven't been swimming in a while...Hell I haven't been outside with my shirt off in a long time so I was WHITE! I got burn like you wouldn't believe. I have a hard time sitting, laying, and it burns like a bitch when I take a shower. O well, but the day was productive. I got to know someone a little better today. I've known the person a while but I got to know her a lot better. Makes me think...and its scary when I start to think lol...Anyways...today my lil friend from church got me a late birthday present. This boy is a lil longhorn boy and when he gave me the present I was surprised because it was in an A&M bag, had an A&M card, and all A&M stuff...it was pretty cool. Might end up getting him recruited to A&M by the time he gets outta elementary...hah...anyways...I'm bored...I hurt...and I'm hungry...Ill catch yawl later!

      Well today started of with a bang! I had to take my dog Desie to the vet...well that didn't work out to well! Now...if you know Desie you will know he is scared of everything! Well, when I was walking up to him with the leash...he ran...so I had to chase him down. After I finally got the leash on the damn dog I had to put him in the car (so I thought) when opening the door to get him in the car he got real freaked out and started to run...well I had the leash on him so he couldn't get to far. I grab his collar to pull him to the car...then the damn dog bites me gets his head out of the collar and runs under the house! Needless to say he missed his appointment.  Then just a few min. Ago my dear sweet Dolores called me...boy that went real well...Past few days she has been giving me an attitude...saying I haven't been "the same"...bullshit...She's the damn one giving me the damn attitude...I'm trying to have a nice convo with her but no...she wants to be sarcastic and ignore me...bleh...I hate this shit...I can see that this week is going to go to hell...Its already gotten off to a bad start. O well, maybe it will get better...I can only hope...I'm out...talk to yall later

      Well, Thankfully Tuesday and Wednesday went great! Tuesday I didn't get a lot of sleep and I was awake for 24 hours but it was good. Tuesday night I went to wings and More and came home to find out that they moved that damn blue thing that was out in front of my house! That made me they happiest person on this Planet! So needless to say Tuesday/Wednesday I got the best sleep ever.   Wednesday afternoon I woke up around 3:45, told you I slept good, and freaked out because I saw the time. I went to bed at 1am and slept that long, that has never happened to me before. Usually if I go to bed at 1 I wake up around 10am or so but this time I slept great! So after that I just watched a little TV and picked my mom up from the bus stop then Juan and I went looking for this CD that I've been wanting, Big & Rich, because I like their song "Save a Horse Ride a Cowboy". That was an adventure! We first go to Best Buy...I can't find the CD anywhere so I asked one of the sales people, well...They SAID they had 15 in stock but they were nowhere to be found. The lady looked in the back and everything, but I dunno if she really looked...She didn't look to bright. So after that we walked over to Barns and Noble to look in their CD section...Well the lady behind the counter seemed high on something and she told me they didn't have it after looking it up. Juan is telling me to forget it and order it online but I was determined to get that CD. So finally we drove to Target...and you would figure it would be the FIRST CD I see when I walk up. So I bought the CD and then went to Starbucks. It was a fun adventure lol and well worth it. I think Juan even thinks it was worth it too because he likes one of those songs on the CD because one of the Country people raps in it lol. Its a pretty cool song...and a really cool CD. :) Ok people, now I am going to bitch about politics so if you don't want to read on you don't have to...but for those people who always argue with me, I encourage you to read on.  Now, when we got into this war all the Demazazies bitched about it and wanted nothing to do with it. They wanted us to pull out and hand it back over to the Iraqis! Well...Now that president Bush does that...THEY BITCH ABOUT THAT!!! WHAT THE HOLY HELL!??! President Bush handed the country over the  Iraqi government early so it would eliminate the possibility of a Terrorist attack. That just makes them bitch! They are saying "We shouldn't of handed it over early because it didn't give a chance for people to celebrate" What the hell? He was doing them all a favor! Yall finally got what yall wanted, hell you even got it two days earlier than what President Bush said, now yall bitch about it. I wish they would Just sit down and shut the hell up! I saw a bumper Sticker that said it best... "The road to HELL is paved with Liberals" ...Thank You!

      Well its been a while sense I last posted and figured it was time to post again. A lot has happened sense the last time I posted and a lot of it I don't really want to talk about. Nothing really happened on Thursday and on Friday Juan and I saw Spiderman 2. It was a pretty good movie I guess...I liked it better than the first one. Saturday I did a whole lot of nothing. I went to this BBQ in Crosby thrown by some guy at my church, it sucked ass. My and two of my friends were listening to the radio in my car and it turns out when its time to leave we kinda drained the battery...lol that was funny. Sunday went to church and then my uncle came over and we all watched the fireworks between Jacinto City and Galena Park then later on went to Starbucks in the Galaria...not a whole lot going on to post about. Have no complaints about the way things are going right now. Things can be better or worse. Oh, one last thing...If you want to read my blog and get mad at me because you don't like what I have to say about politics...Well, you can stop getting mad at me and sending me vulgar e-mails cussing me out because you don't like what I have to say. My e-mail address is not where you cuss me out. I told yall at the start I don't care if you get pissed off or not. This my place where I can put what I want without fear of what people read...If you don't like what I say and want to complain about it...Get your own damn blog...Don't e-mail me and CC all your friends...That's just gay...Make your blog...Type what you have to say...Post a comment telling me to go there...Then we can have Blog wars...That would be fun. And I think I just pissed off the person even more...lol I DON'T CARE!! :) Anyways, I'm out...Later!

      Ok, I recently read joys journal and all the responces so I have to get my word in. Everybody knows my views on gays, cant stand them, never will. And I seriously hate the fact that the Governmanet want to leagalize it... In a responce to joys journal a person wrote "Ever hear of seperation of church and state?" Well, in my opinion seperationg of church and state is a bunch on nonsence. This country was founded on the principals of christian believes and i hate when i hear people bitching about saying the word "God" in the plege or in school or anything to do wiht our government. Wehn a president gets sworn into offince he hold his hand on the Bible and says an oath, same thing in court. Is that now wrong too? I hate this Bull about seperation of church and state. Now back to the gay subject. The bible falt out says Homosexuality is a sin, "Do not practice homosexuality; it is a detestable sin" Leviticus 18:22. You can also find it in Romans 1:18-32 and in 1 Corithians 6:9-10. Now wether you want to say that the bible has its faults and blah blah blah, thats your decision. But it says right htere that it is a sin, and thats what Ill believe.  &nbsp;  "We take his name out of schools  &nbsp; Lawyers say it breaks the rules  &nbsp; Pledge of Alligence cant me read  &nbsp; And 'Under God' should not be said  &nbsp;&nbsp;I wounder how much he will take,  &nbsp; I just pray its not to late  &nbsp;  &nbsp; What if God quit trying?  &nbsp; He just turned away  &nbsp; If there were tear drops on his face  &nbsp; Tell me how would you feel,  &nbsp; youd prally give up too  &nbsp; If nobody believed in you"  &nbsp; ~Joe Nicholes

      " 'This country was founded on the principals of christian believes' Bullshit, this Country was based on freedom of religion. Therefor, all your bitching about how christianity is the only religion that isn't going to burn in hell is very rediculous, because you've got to realize that Christianity is a new idea compared to buddism and hinduism... fuck it, atheism is older then christianity. I can't wait for one of these days to come when you really care for someone, and you try to further your bond with them in whatever way, and you cant because of bigotry and hatred. Do you think you have a bigger cock because you stand in the way of people's happiness? Do you get some sick amusement to make people feel bad? It's bigots like you who give the United States a bad name. Congratufuckinglations on becoming a jackass."   Ok, First of all, whoever posted that comment needs to go back and read what i wrote! Not once did i say that christianity was the only religion not going to hell....In fact, i didnt even mention anybody going to hell...I just stated what i believed as far as the bible and christianity. And as far as this country being founded on christian beliefes...HELLO GENIOUS!!! IT WAS!! Read in every history book...it says it right there. On money it says "In god we trust"...in teh plege..."One Nation Under God"...It mentions god in our constitution! Like I said, I wasnt denouncing other religions or beliefes. Thats what makes this country great, you can worship whatever you like. I have friends who are athiest and the list goes on and on. I have no problem with a person being gay! thats their right, Im just saying what I believe is right, that my faith tells me is right! So if that makes me a jackass I guess i am...I dont know how you got what you did from my last post...but its however you want to translate it. O btw, i have 2 gay friends and a gay aunt that i love to death...but it still doesnt cahnge what i believe. God Bless America
