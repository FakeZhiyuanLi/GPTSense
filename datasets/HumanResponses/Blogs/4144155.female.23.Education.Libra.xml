      Well, this morning has been a bit hectic! - I was due to have an early night last night, which started off OK - I was in bead fast asleep by 10.30pm!  I zonked straight out.  11.30, the phone rang.  It was Mark... sorry that he'd forgotten to call earlier but he'd been on a winning streak at the pub playing pool.  England had won 3-0 and he was a bit "hammered"!  I said OK and I'd see him tomorrow.  I fell fast asleep again!  12.20, the phone rang.  It was Mark... Did I want any company!!??  I had been asleep twice by now and sooooo tired... But the thought of snuggling down next to him is a nice one, so I said OK.  Went downstairs, unlocked the door and went back to bed - accidently fell asleep!  12.35, the door opened, waking me once again!  "Hello, it's just me!" the stage-whisper came floating up the stairs... "Where are you?" "I'm in bed, fast asleep!"  I stage-whispered back! We got snuggled down quickly and just as we both dropped off to sleep...  12.50, the phone rang!  It was Tree this time, asking if I'd got sorted with Marius for my lift down to Ideenlehre, the Maelstrom event next month.  I said he'd not been back in touch and I couldn't get back in touch with him.  Tree invited Mark along, but he made it clear he wasn't interested in LARP at all!  I can understand - it must seem a little bit mad!  :D  Anyway, finally got back to sleep and, other than the occasional snore or cat purr waking me up, I slept soundly until this morning.  7.45am, the phone rang!  It was my sister telling me my Dad was on his way over to wait in for my new mobile phone to be delivered!  Minor stress as Mark threw on his clothes, left and said he'd pop home, change and pick me up for work!  :P  Dad arrived and grumped a little bit about staying in, (it's a rainy day, so it's not like he'd be playing golf!) until I showed him how my big TV worked and how to play a DVD on it!  Anyway, it's A Level Results day here at Derwentside College and I was asked to come in specifically, (I was going to wait in for my new phone) but so far everyone's run off to get all excited about the possibility that the press turn up!  I guess I should go and see if they want a hand...  *sigh*

      Well, here I am again - working late till 7pm today.  Well, I would be working if there was anyone wanted to enrol to our fabulous College... But it's been quiet - well, except for my singing.  My boss would probably be a bit upset at the unprofessionalism of my singing, but everyone who's come through the front doors have either joined in or have been smiling with me when they've left.  If people can come past me and leave feeling happier than they did before they meet me, then I think it's got to be a good thing!  The reason for the singing is one of two things: 1 - because I'm still seeing Mark and VERY happy about the fact - I've had a HUGE grin on my face for the last 2 weeks and 3 days! 2 - because I've been taking Actimel ProBiotic for the last 2 weeks and 3 days - It's supposed to make you feel this good - or so the adverts say, but everyone I work with assumes it's the first option that's had me feeling so good about everything!  I'd just like to point out for those who don't really know me - it's unusual for me to be this chipper (or in fact, to use words like 'chipper') but, in case you've not guessed, I'm feeling quite good at the minute!  *HUGS* to everyone in the universe that is making my world turn in the direction I've been dreaming of for so long!  ~T x

      ARGH! Just when you want it to rain!  It's been pouring down for the last few days and Mark and I thought up some (quite naughty) plans to keep us entertained while it was raining!  It was that nice hot rain too... *sigh* I guess you can't win them all!  *starts to do a rain dance!*  ~T x

      Last night I had a girly night in, with Gill, Cat & Krish, 3 of my best friends in the world.  General girly-chat commenced (talking about everything from fluffy bunny rabbits to vibrators!) and various Chinese food was ordered!  Yummm!  We also discussed the fact that Mark (my new-b/f) still lives with his ex-g/f, which doesn't really bother me, I've got a lot of ex's who are still friends and if I'd bought a house with one of them then I couldn't imagine either of us being thrown out onto the streets just coz everyone else thinks it's a bit weird!  But - it's the fact that I know this though a mutual friend, not coz he's told me which my friends are worried about.  I have just assumed that it's coz he assumes that I know, but I've also heard that they break their relationship on and off on a regular basis.  I don't want to be a stand in until he decides to get back with her (like my friends think might be a possibility), but I don't think that's what's happening.  Then again, theoretically, if it is, I don't really care so much - I'm happy as it is (I've been a happy, bouncy, smiley kitty since last friday) and, short of a death of a loved one, I can't imagine anything bringing me down at the minute!  If he ever did want to get back with his ex, that's up to him, not me, I wouldn't be able to do anything about it, so I might as well just really enjoy the time I have with him now!  Just like anything, there's an uncertainty, but without the risk of getting hurt, there's nothing worth having there!  I went to bed quite early and texted Mark for a while, (his last reply "nitey nite and sweet dreams sexy.xxx") then went to sleep purry happy...  ...To be worken up by Tree calling to ask if I've registered for Maelstrom yet!  Maelstrom is a Live Action Role Play event - see  urlLink http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/index.asp  for more details.  We've come up with a character concept for me, but I've not registered as I'd not thought of a name.  Now I have a name, Pica Nuttallis, so today I have to see if I can have the days off.  :)  THEN I was woken at 3am by the loudest thunder storm I've heard in a long time.  It lasted for about 2 hours, so I'm a bit tired today! *yawn*  *hugs* to Smartie &amp; Scruff who kept me company through the night.

      Well, here it is - since I couldn't be bothered to add new web-pages each week to my website to let the world (and me) keep track of what's happening in my life, I finally found blogger.com!  At the minute, I'm kinda deliriously happy, I've just got a new boyfriend, I might be getting my parent's new car (which I happened to crash - oops!), my two cats are happy and purry and my boss is off work for a fortnight, so I can chill and get on with my work at my own pace without being interrupted and told to hurry and stress over every little thing!  *hugs* to the world in general!

      A bit of a weird title for a blog, but I'm getting a bit freaked out by the occourances of this number in my life.  It seems to crop up randomly, but often enough for me to notice and be a bit weirded out!  Last night, I stumbled through the door (ready for my early night), went straight upstairs, removed my shoes, looked at the clock and it was 22:22.  I was watching a video today (Mel Gibson in Leathal Weapon 3) and the phone rang.  I stopped it, answered the phone and when I came back in the room to start my vid again, the timer on the video read 22:22!  I'm gonna try keep track of these in my blog and people can let me know if I'm just paranoid or if there might be something behind it.  Maybe I'm destined to die on the 2nd of Feb 2022???
