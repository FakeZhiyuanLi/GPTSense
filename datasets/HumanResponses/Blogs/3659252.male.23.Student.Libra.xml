      What a day!  So here's my input on the week's plans:  I have not seen Spider Man, but would love to watch the DVD.  If you want, we could hit a matinee showing of Spidey 2 on Wednesday or Thursday.   I haven't seen any of the Harry Potter movies... does this put me at a disadvantage in seeing the last one?  If not, I would be interested in seeing that tonight.  BUT... if you guys want to see a movie earlier in the day, we could always go to a matinee showing of Farenheit 911... it won't be $4, but it will be pretty darn close.  Lana... the Onion is perhaps the greatest literary achievement of our time.  I love their "Point, Counterpoint" pieces:)

      do any of you guys read the onion? well, i was looking at it this morning and came across these two gems so i thought i would share... i could NOT stop laughing!  (to cover my ass for copyright purposes: http://www.theonion.com/)  Local Woman Dies Of Lost Cell Phone APALACHICOLA, FL— Catherine Polk, 24, died at a local Starbucks Monday afternoon, due to complications resulting from the tragic loss of her cell phone. "It was horrible—Cathy didn't have any of her numbers written down anywhere else, and she was waiting on a call about last-minute tickets for a concert," said best friend Melissa Barreth, who was with Polk when she first discovered that her Cingular V400 quad band/GSM cell phone was not in her purse. "We tried everything to find it, but in the end, there was nothing we could do." The coroner's report confirmed that Polk died of a sudden lack of wireless service.  7-Year-Old Asshole Demands You King Him COS COB, CT— On the 23rd turn of the game Monday, 7-year-old asshole Andy Scot advanced a checker to the opposite end of the board and plunked it down on a black square. "King me," the smug little bastard said, folding his pudgy arms across his sweater-vested chest. "Do it." The checkers game, which continued apace after you placed a checker on top of his, was at least a reprieve from hearing the little shit say "sorry" during the game of the same name.  thought that might brighten your day :)

      hey guys~ i know this is far in advance but i was wondering if you wanted to hang out on friday and if so, what do people want to do? i am not sure what time i will be getting to cleveland, but we could meet up to see Spiderman 2 (provided you don't see it w/o me earlier this week!! haha) or we could go to a bar or something like that. what do you all think? i figured if we started discussing it early then we could get something going for sure so the plans don't fall through...  i think my family is leaning towards having the bbq & party on saturday as of right now, but i will keep you guys posted. is everyone going to ravi's on sunday?

      Today, how about a good ol' half-priced AMC movie? I'm free all day, but the earlier the better. I think we should call ahead and reserve tickets so we don't have to wait in that massive line of punks. Here are the movies and showtimes of movies that I want or am willing to see:   AMC Westgate Mall Cinema    Around the World in 80 Days -  (1:30 PM), (4:20), 7:10, 9:50    Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban -  (2:00), (4:00), (5:10), 7:10, 9:15      AMC Westwood Town Center Cinema    Day After Tomorrow, The -  (1:10 PM), (4:10), 7:00, 9:40    Spider-Man 2 -  12:01 AM    Stepford Wives, The -  (2:55), (5:10), 7:30, 9:50    Terminal, The - ( 4:00), 7:00, 9:50    Oh yeah...so "Spiderman 2" comes out on Wednesday and I reeeeeeeeeeally want to see it. I own the first one and was going to watch it this week so I can refresh my memory with every nerdy detail. Either of these activities sound appealing to you guys? I don't HAVE to see it on opening day, but if I wait too long to see it, I may develop a bladder infection. If none of you want to see it, I'll be forced to take my mom. I'll be dressed as Spiderman and she will be dressed as Doctor Octopus...

      yo guys-  i'm down to see a movie tomorrow... unfortunately, i've seen the terminal (which i thought was awesome).  i would be up to see harry potter though - it's playing at 510 and 710 at one of the two theatres... i'm too lazy to check which one.  lemme know  anand

      Where did all the bloggers go??    I'm sorry to have missed out on the Hibachi action of last week.  My dad seemed very lonely that evening, so I decided to spend some time with him.  This entailed splitting a bottle of wine and learning about his early years in the old country.  Fascinating stuff... especially once the wine started flowing:)  So what is the plan for this week?  Sushi on Wednesday... anyone up for a $4 movie tomorrow?  Farenheit 911 is not playing at Westwood or Westgate, but we could go see the Terminal (even though Lana said it sucks.)    Lana, if you get off work early on Friday, when would you be back in town?  Maybe we could still do a ladies tea this weekend...  Sunita, what's your availability?

      yes my friends, i am back after a week long hiatus due to the lack of internet in my prehistoric ridgeville home. sorry i missed out on all the posts from this past week (including the La Tea Da plans - i am sad about that!)   i will be back in cleveland for the next two weekends and i hear a rumor that i may be getting out of work early on friday, which is VERY exciting!   for those who are interested, here is my take on the movies i saw this past week:  Fahrenheit 9/11: awesome. does exactly what it sets out to do - which is make Bush look like a jackass. i learned a lot of shocking things about Bush's reaction while the events were actually taking place (he knew of the first plane hitting before he went in to read to the kids and kept reading for another 7 or so minutes before someone had to come whisper in his ear to remind him that he is the president and should be doing something). it's really well done but moore is lying through his teeth when he says that he did not set out to make it a political film. (he said this with a straight face on the Today show)  FUN FACT: scott & i met michael moore and we got to hold his oscar when he came to UR! it was right after he won it and he said that he was carrying it everywhere with him.   dodgeball: i think most of you saw it already. personally, i LOVED it! so hilarious. not quite as good as zoolander, but similar humor and ridiculously funny characters.  the terminal (aka: one of the most painfully boring & long movies i have seen) enough said...but i will say more: it sucked. the main storyline wasn't that great and tom hanks is played out.   who's excited for spiderman?? (other than jake of course!)   what are the plans this weekend? has anyone talked to tim?

      hey everyone,  I am having a party this coming sunday(the 4th).  It's kind of a tradition with my Case friends...it's always a great time... bbq and we buy a shit load of fireworks(real fireworks, not wimpy stuff) and set them off over the lake.  Festivities will start around 5 or 6ish, but just come anytime, i'll start grilling around 6.  If you just wanna come for fireworks, come at like 9 or 9:30.  I hope everyone can make it!  Ravi

      The Sushi Rock saga continues... do you guys want to try to go NEXT Wednesday?  The reservations process is getting a little ridiculous at this point... but I'm willing to try to get a table again.    Who's with me?! Blog it up ASAP so we can reserve early.

      Ladies, would you like to do tea today?   (Rephrase: If we don't do tea today, I couldn't be a part of an Earl Grey hour until next Monday.)  Sorry about the late notice, but I just found out that we are leaving for New York tomorrow morning to see some family friends.  Sunita, I know you have plans with your mom... are you spending the day together?

      So what do you guys wanna do this week? I'm most likely free every single day at any given hour. Here's a few things I'd like to do this week: - see a movie (preferably half-priced at Westwood) There are still a buttload of movies I want to see  - play basketball or play video games or play a basketball video game  - Greek festival is this week...its fun...eat some greek food, drink some beer, do a weird circle dance with a bunch of sweaty Greek people...  - go to dinner...eating is my favorite hobby  - drink, drink, drink! We have so many bars to go to, so little time! We've got the bars in downtown, lakewood, rocky river, westlake, avon lake, north ridgeville, etc...

      Did you guys here about this? Madonna changed her name to Esther - which is apparently a Hebrew name associated with the Jewish holiday, Purim. Not sure it fits...but I guess it follows from her goal of constantly reinventing herself.  What's next? The artist previously known as Esther and formerly known as Madonna?   urlLink Check it out.

      i'm down to hang out tonight... i vote we do something active (active does not necessarily preclude alcohol, though, so don't worry, scott) like bowling, pool or something like that...  what do others think?  or we could find a place where we could play that game i was telling you about at brendan o'neill's - the one with the bumber cars and the hoops... i can't remember what it's called.

      if justin's party gets cancelled tomorrow too, I vote we go out somewhere...locally or downtown.  Maybe in one of those bars in lakewood(jake, scott, u remember that one bar that was really cheap? like dollar drafts, what was the name of it?).  Or we could go to Wish or Traffic on W. 6th.  Or how about Dick's in elyria? maybe they'll be having a wet thong contest(as advertised on the radio).

( if this blogg had smileys...this is where I would insert the smiley with a single tear on his cheek )  Anyways, the party has been postponed until Friday (June 18th) so hopefully it won't rain then. If not, lets think of something else to do this weekend....like get drunk.

      i will be home from this friday through sunday 6/27 - so i def will get to hang out with everyone a lot (i miss last summer - when i did nothing but wake up at noon, go to emh to work out, and participate in the superfriends events planned by the social chair)  who wants to see dodgeball this weekend? it looks so hilarious!    sheila: this ZZ's big top obsession has been going for awhile now...i am willing to brave the unknown with you at some point - although we may want to get some of the guys to go as well because i always seem to attract sketchy random guys & i feel like there will be tons of those types at that bar. also, getting tea with you & sunita will be fun! i am def in :)   on a random note: have you guys seen the kill bill movies? i saw both and LOVED them - i think the second one is better (the whole exploding heart storyline was awesome) and i was wondering what you guys thought...also, as i was walking from my parking lot to work this morning i suddenly started whistling (which i rarely do) the creepy tune that is in the first kill bill (if you've seen them you will know what i am talking about)  in other movie news, i have become a HUGE harry potter dork - saw the third movie and loved it. i didn't see the first two but i just started reading the first book & i am a bit addicted.

      I am new to blogging (I accept Lana's decision to make "blog" a verb), so this is a big day for me.  I was thinking that while everyone is home, we should try to diversify our activities... this could include new bars and restaurants, outdoorsy stuff and non-paying activities.  Does anyone like playing ultimate frisbee or volleyball?  Both of these could be co-ed games... unless the beauty of playing basketball is the testosterone shield that radiates off the court.  And if you haven't heard already, my resolution for 2004 is to go to Z Z's Big Top on the corner of Detroit and Jaycox.  I'm very scared to go alone... and I don't particularly think I'd enjoy a lynching... but who's with me on this one?!  Okay, that's enough for now. (Shout out to my ladies... Lana, Sunita... do you want to go out for tea next week?  There's this cute place in Lakewood called La Tea Da.  I suggested going there once to Ravi, and he said he was busy "that night."  Funny, I never specified a date...)

      yo guys-  check this out... this guy won the darwin award for this year (basically for being stupid enough to eliminate his own genes from the gene pool)  AND THE WINNER IS.....   No.1 Based on a bet by the other members of his threesome, Everitt Sanchez tried to wash his own "balls" in a ball washer at the local golf course. Proving once again that beer and testosterone are a bad mix, Sanchez managed to straddle the ball washer and dangle his scrotum in the machine. Much to his dismay, one of his buddies upped the ante by spinning the crank on the machine with Sanchez's scrotum in place, thus wedging his testicles solidly in the mechanism. Sanchez, who immediately passed his threshold of pain, collapsed and tumbled from his perch. Unfortunately for Sanchez, the height of the ball washer was at least a foot higher off the ground than his testicles are in a normal stance, and the scrotum was the weakest link. Sanchez's scrotum was ripped open during the fall, and one testicle was plucked from him forever and remained in the ball washer, while the other was compressed and flattened as it was pulled between the housing of the washer, and the rotating machinery inside. To add insult to injury, Sanchez broke a new $300.00 driver that he had just purchased from the pro shop, and was using to balance himself. Sanchez was rushed to the hospital for surgery, and the remaining threesome was asked to leave the course.   Note: This last one wouldn't normally count, because the idiot didn't die. But because he cannot reproduce as a result of his qualifying act of stupidity, we have allowed it.

      Yo, yesterday I got the job at the Robert Half International Company. Heard of it? (the guy that interviewed e said they were a big company, but I've never heard of them) Anyways, they have a branch downtown called the Creative Group that deals with multimedia stuff. They hired me for the remainder of the summer so I'll be staying in Cleveland for longer than I thought.   Anyways, to celebrate, I'm going to go watch Spiderman 2 now and later get tanked.
