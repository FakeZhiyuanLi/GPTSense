      well people - how are we today?&nbsp; Today was my last day of classes - took my exams YEAH!!! Also, i went out and looked at this sweet house with a few of my friends were really interested in it - only problem is we need like $1000 for a security deposit and were all frickin college students so that is unlikely to happen if you know what i mean.&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend ashley and i were talking today and she said this really cool quote although she's not sure where she heard it&nbsp; :  &nbsp;  Relationships are like sand, the tighter you hold them the more they slip through your fingers, the less you squeeze them the more it stays intact  she's sooo smart.

      This song always brings me back to the wonderful price that Jesus paid for me:   Artist:  urlLink Seven Places  Album: Lonely For The Last Time Song: AwakeningJesus Christ our Savior who is the propitiation, the satisfaction if you would, for our sins, and not just for our sins, but for the sins of the whole world. The blood of Jesus Christ flowed from seven places. The first place He bleed from, the blood that poured from His head that day. The blood from the thorns in His skull cleanse you from thoughts, the blood that was on His face He has covered the things that you may not want to face up to because of what you've seen or heard. Know this, the blood fl owed for you. "Yeah, but Jon, you just don't know I've backed away from the Lord, I've turned my back on him." Well they took a flagellum and they beat His back and blood flowed from His back, it reduced to hamburger meat that day, His back was beaten so brutally. And if you've turned your back on Him and walked away from Him, know this, the blood, the blood that poured from His back, cleanses you sprinkles you. "Yeah but Jon, you just don't know what I've done with these hands." Those hands were pierced, those hands were pinned to the tree, spikes driven through those hands where He bled to cleanse you and cleanse me from the stuff that we've handled that we ought not to have handled, the stuff that we've done that we ought not to have done. Hey, understand, the blood flowed from His hand. "Yeah but it's stuff that's inside of me Jon, It's just things that I feel in my gut, I have bitterness towards them, and I'm angry with her." Jesus wants you to know that blood flowed from His side when they thrust th at spear into Him when He hung on the cross. "Feet that walked where I ought not to have walked." Blood flowed from His feet too, when the spike pinned Him through the feet, to the cross of calvary. And now I realize things that I can't face up to, thoughts that I've had that are not right, not good, not true, bitterness inside of me, stuff I've touched that I ought not to touch, places I've gone where I ought not to have walked. And I look and I realize the seven-fold flowing of the blood of Christ clean ses me in every area from all sin and I'm free, and I'm forgiven, by the blood. What can wash away my sin, nothing but the blood of Jesus. Seven times perfection, Seven places, that's what He went through, for me and for you.   It is my prayer that these words will bring you back to to the ultimate realization of Jesus'&nbsp; love for you  Goodnight - Travis

      Last night i finally made it to the Funamental Baptist church in Kincheloe, MI - it was a happy experience for me - i got to see extended family that i haven't seen since i was 6 or7 years old . . .&nbsp; I actually think they were more happy to see me than i them - I met a friend of mine's family and they seem really awesome - i actually am thinking about going out there for church on Sundays.&nbsp; The Pastor graduated from the first college that i attended "Northland Baptist Bible College"&nbsp; I actually miss portions of that University, I have friends there that finally graduated and are now in the field of Christian Service - maybe one day down the road i will meet them again.&nbsp; If not, there's always heaven.  Right now i'm reading a book called the  Da VInci Code  it's a relatively good book - except it's making me doubt some of my beliefs that i've been raised with - which i don't appreciate, sure it means i'm a critical reader - but the delusions put forth in this book are written in such a way that a lesser CHristian could be caught up in the lies.  Anyone reading this , please know i need prayer - i just found out that i'm moving into my Fraternity house for this year - it's the only way i can stay @ school that i know of.&nbsp; I so much want to be a strong Christian, but in the presence of so many non - Christians my faith has to be deeply grounded ----> This is my one prayer, that i will be a light in the darkness and won't be consumed by the darkness.&nbsp; Jesus loves you, now i must go to class .&nbsp; Have a great day - Travis

      wel, i don't really know how to start - i'm back lke i used to be . . ..church @ night and then smoking and other stuff soon afterwards.&nbsp; I found out last night that my buddy is giving me his scholarship for Cedar campus; and one church is giving all of us from the school $25 towards the $300 required for the intense week of Bible camp - God's starting to answer questions even if i'm not really relying on Hiim at the present time. I have to write this paper about my worldview for my humanities class due next Thursday and yet i don't know what to write - to initiate creativity i pulled out one of my drawing pads and went to work on that trying to figure out how to say what i believe -&nbsp; so that it makes sense to the reader. . .&nbsp; i'm an English major so i best macke this peiper make cents. . . . :)&nbsp;  Peace out people - God loves you  T

      interesting is the first comment - intriguing would be a second . . . Although the third comment would be - "haven't i seen something like this before?"&nbsp; This film vaguely reminded me of  Fight Club .&nbsp; I still would highly recommend this - i liked the character development - others didn't&nbsp; - maybe they are better critics - who knows.  Today i turned in my apron at "the Antler's"&nbsp; as much as i may have liked aspects of the job - it was too time consuming - my grades were starting to suffer - mainly because i wasn't getting any sleep - let alone time to work on schoolwork -  Aslo suffering was my God time - he kind of took a backseat over the past 4 weeks as i slowly, but surely squeezed Him out of my life.  God knows the predicament that I've put myself in now - concerning summer housing, bills, and camp in August - also, maybe God wants me in Anchor house - which would actually be pretty sweet, but i f i stay in the fraternity house - i just have to pray that I'm a light in a dark room and that i not be consumed by the darkness around me - thankfully i have a family and others at church who will help support me in whatever endeavors i take on.  &nbsp;  peace and God bless  Travis   &nbsp;

      if anyone reads this - i could use a whole lot of prayer.&nbsp; My life is a wreck, i turn to God and it's almost as if He's not there.&nbsp; I see small changes in my life - butthey are nowhere near the extent that i want them to be. . . . why do God's answers sometimes move slowly?&nbsp; How does one know when He's not forcing a door to stay open, when God in fact wants to shut it?&nbsp; How does one increase his/her faith&nbsp; =&nbsp; like i feel like God really wants me here at this time but certain criteria are lacking for said thing, or how much should i reach into the world before i am the world?&nbsp; i apologize for the ramblings&nbsp; - i usually like to speak coherently - peace people > Travis

      Why is it - that many Christians are put in situations that they don't know how to handle especially in regard to parents who don't hold the same convictions as their offspring?  Jesus said love one another that your joy may be full, and honour thy mother and father - do these commandments still apply when your early parents are cursing your heavenly father?    A man who hung on a tree for everyone is ridiculed and made fun of day in and day out in this, our "modern" society.  Jesus saves yesterday, today, and for forever - His love is everlasting.

      On the tree of Calvary in AD 32 a Godman hung as the crux of humanities existence. He said "I love you this much as He stretched His arms on the cross . . .  A young child when asked by a parent how much he loves them is always - i love you "this" much as he stretches his hands as far apart from each other as is humanly possible - is it possible that this mannerism - was predestinated to be used as a reminder to those who look for it - the undending love of God for you and i.   I ws just reading    The Purpose Driven Life    in a chapter about the love of God and came to my own conclusions based on watching children, and remembering how much i used to say i loved my parents - I love you "this" much

      It's been a few days since i last posted.  My buddy aren came up with his girlfriend and her family for her brothers wedding which is tomorrow.  It was kind of fun hanging with aren - in fact he hung out here so he didn't have to sleep in the van.  Playing guitars til early morning hours - i really missed that  . ..  but it was awesome, cause we played Wednesday night til about 4 am when the next door neighbors started sending phone calls our way to stop playing.   You know somewhere along life's road i was told that God gives His children "rest".  I wonder if i'm a child of the King because my life is in constant motion, i even wake up tired - but, somehow i make it through another day.  I just can't wait for school to start so i can go back  to one job. I got my information from InterVarsity Christian Fellowship today about this Small Group Leaders Training that i'm going to be doing in August (Lord Willing).  Reading about it has got me stoked - to be an instrument in the hand of the most supreme artist of all - God.  Although, i find that through my tiredness aspects of my personality seem to come out at certaim people - my apathy for one - i hate it when i get so tired that i don't even care - it's such a bad place to be.  I have thought of a new thing - before i go to bed i listen to Classical music, deeply.  And, then throughout the night i have "Christian" music playing at a quiet level and it's amazing the levels of relaxation  that i reach as i sleep.  I must be off for now - to my faithful readers, and others :  May God direct you in the way He wants you to go.  The road is long and narrow - but the end is Glorious

      holy, it was crazy i went into class tonight thought i was prepared for the essay test - yeah, i wasn't ... there was this question that was required i didn't bother studying for that one - WHOOPS So i just made up a whole bunch of theoretical jargon in relation to the symbols being asked for - i think that i was pretty convincing it remains to be seen.  I got my English test back today - got a 106%  in high school i never got above a C - maybe things are finally starting to sink in - WEll, i can wish can't i?   Didn't get any financial aid for the fall so i'm gonna have to kiss the feet of the alternative loan companies. ... I'm so glad that the government controls the monetary system of this country - NOT!!! What idiots, they tell us that we spend too much money - yet they take tax dollars and give free services to the smokers to help them quit.  Why don't they take some of that money and give it to the colleges - this whole "Leave no child behind" thing is a bunch of crap.  They lost the children, and control of the classroom when they took the Bible out of the Public Schools - it's not a well rounded education unless you get the myth of evolution and the Biblical truth of Christianity.  I think of a carman song right now- but i can't think of the title words to the first verse start out:   Ball got dropped in 62, they wouldn't let the children pray in school Grades went down the kids got high teen pregancy on the rise Free love, gay rights, no absolutes abortion on demand  Brought VD, Aids and no morality  Today no one knows right from wrong  THere's blood on people's hands  World you 've had your turn at bat Now stand back and see  Chorus:  That it's our turn now  Things are gonna change WE're gonna bind the devil at every hand by the power of Jesus name And, it's our turn now . . . .  When the gates of hell come crashing down and you begin to see the church arise  Well that's about it for now  - Peace people God loved you and died for you - die to yourself and be a servant -

      What is the purpose of man on earth?  Is it to satisfy every mortal lust, or is it something more? What leads man to derive pleasure from alcohol, and tobacco?  What is the "base", this root that is grounded deep in our physical being? As a former Drunkard i have tasted the pains of situations that come because of the drunkeness  . . .  BUT God is faithful!   When i put my trust and daily walk in Him He helps me "... overtake the sins that sooo easily beset me." He has made a way of escape from the situations that i find myself in - just in order that i may be able to bear  up under them.   Hw can a young man keep his way pure?  Or, let's rephrase that - how can a young man renew his way?  By following the words of the law, as spoken to the prophets of old. A, friend, i shall call her answered questions in a sincere, logical God fearing way that i have long forgotten - i only wish that I can find myself once again so easily able to crawl into the Father's lap whenever i am lost in this world.  Words from a song by Petra now enter my mind:   We are pilgrims, we are aliens - we are not of this world.  How, if i would only apply these words daily to my walk on this mortal plain; my life would be soo different no bruises and breaks from the demons that ravage the lives of men that have taken me, a former bible college student into depths of sin that i only wish i never knew - But God is faithful - His love for you and me is undending ! HAlelujah - In another portion of scripture it says, "All things work together for good, to them that love God and live according to His purpose -  . . ."  Well, Hallelujah, God can take my "broken pieces" and mend them and make me something beautiful still.  The words to the songs "broken pieces" are:  Have you failed in life's battles to accomplish your plan  Is your heart heavy-laden, do you fear the Lords command  Do you feel that no one loves you, and there's no use to try Just bring your cares to Jesus - your soul he'll satisy  Chorus:  Pick up the broken pieces and bring them to the Lord Pick up, the broken pieces trust in His holy word  He will put you back together and make your life complete Just leave the broken pieces at the Savior's feet  You may feel that there's no hope Broken hearts just cannot mend Tho your torn in many pieces Christ can make you whole again Storms of doubt blow all directions But don't be afraid  God can make all corrections, He made a body out of clay.  I was six or seven when i first heard this song - my mom and dad sang it at church, and i sang it with them for my grandmother and grandpa - you know it's funny i never really understood the song until i came to the point last year when i had nothing to live for - then i went to a Bible study and God wonderously started a change in me that is going to one day make me a beautiful and fit vessel for the lady that He has in mind.  Peace all - if you're still reading - God bless

      one of the ladies at my church passed away on Friday during a "routine" heart operation from complications.  I skipped the early morning service today because i was plumb tuckered out of it - so i stayed @ home and worshipped my pillow for two extra hours.  I hope God isn't going to hold that against me :P  On Tuesday i have a humanities test that i lost my review sheet to - must ask roomate to borrow his.  This blog is seeming to go well, i've had more hits than i thought i would in like 2 months - yeah!! Now i'm sitting in church and a song by Rebecca St Jamesis being played, "I thank you . . ."  in remeberance for all of those who have paid the dearest cost to give us our freedom - their own lives.  How thankless i am, i find myself casting doubt and negativity toward those who are trying to make this world a better place -  America the Beautiful, what an awesome song.  it's too bad that the only time people feel like singing these and other patriotic songs is in a church somewhere .  .   . I bet you their are people out there who don't even know the words to America the Beautiful.  Imagine standing looking at the Rockies - "For purple mountains majesties;"  or the great plains of oklahoma and those states - "across the fruited plains" - the whole image of the song is lost on sooo many people.  The sheer reliance on God is evident throughout the next three verses - look it up, it's true.  A land that boasts in God we trust is shutting Him out at every turn. And the words on the tablet of the statue of liberty - give us your poor, beleagured . . . - we cast them out also.  Embrace the unloved, show them that someone still cares - i saw pictures of little arabian children, innocent . . . if we don't reach to them they will reach @ us but with weapons.  God's love is unmatchless and unending - He died for them as well as for you - today i'll end with words from my favorite song:    I'm proud to be an American where at least i know i'm free.  I won'ot forget the men who died to give this life to me; and i'll gladly stand up, next to you, defend her still today 'cause there ain't no doubt i love this land God bless  the USA.  Peace people i'll be onlater to talk more about the 4th

      Let's see, what to write?  I work @ Jc Penney i'm really annoyed by the slutty clothes that we sell; it's like i work at a cheap imitation of Abercrombie or something - we even have the double meaning t shirts - what is this world coming to?  Things that weren't even dared to be joked about are now plain and simply right in our face.  And that's only in the store.  The lack of respect for one's body is the only thing that could bring someone to put on that skimpy swimsuit or whatnot - the days of decency and modesty i guess are gone.  These are my thoughts not yours, although i am interested if anyone has a different viewpoint leave me a comment or sign the guestbook.  Peace all -  God loves you

      Tonight i went to Humanities - YEAH -  NOT!! Teacher is sooo boring, the bad coloured movie held more interest than his monotone voice.  Art is supposed to be fun - he needs to stop teaching like a coroner.  God's love for us is timeless - many people don't realize this - that God loves unconditionally  - That means "no matter what".  It doesn't give you an open invitation to live a life of debauchery and sin; but it is there to let you know that Abba's arms are always open to embrace a child of His own and hold them when they are hurt from the world's fiery arrows >>---->
