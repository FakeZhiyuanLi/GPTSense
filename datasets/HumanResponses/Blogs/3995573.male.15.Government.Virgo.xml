      :Open Log:  Hi all, I'm about to head out for West Virginia, I won't be home until next Saturday but my folks will be home. Eh well, I was so looking foward to Phils party too. *laughs*  Can't wait for all that fun I'm guna have with the precious few weeks left in Summer. Maybe I'll pay you a visit... never know.  Oh oh oh, today I ran into Roxanne, Robb and her friend at ACMoore, then bill saw us and came over, then we went inside and I passed Shelly, then I saw that J'Cock was working there today. I said hi, it was great to see a bunch of my friends before I left.  Oh well... Roxanne, You don't have to put up a red light. Roxanne, You don't have to sell your body to the night.  G'Nite all  :End Log:

      :Open Log:  Well, today was great. I hung out with Chavez, Greg and Ryan all day. We tried to rent the bourne identity so we could watch it&nbsp;and then see the sequel but that was just shot to hell. Both Chavez and Greg fell in the mud hahaha it rained like hell but it was a good day all and all.  Phil invited me to his birthday, weehoo, I wanted to go but I'll be headin' down to West Virginia, almost heaven, Blue Ridge Mountain. Ok, well anyways, thats about it.  In conclusion I do not think this has been a perfect week, but it has been a good one on some levels. *Laughs*  I think I should go to bed allthough for me this brings up the question of why I ever woke up in the first place. *Ahem* The reason I woke up is quite simple -- Maybe, just maybe, today will be that one day, that one day that is never going to come when I realise that my actions have paid off in the slightest margin. Today just might be that day when I know that tommorow I won't be alone. Today will be the day I go to bed without asking myself why I woke up.  As you can see I am delusional, but I think it's better to live life dreaming of world that will never be, than to live a life dreading a world that allready is. Where is the&nbsp;Suspense? Where is the Romanticism? Where are those Knights and Princesses who fall in love forever not for better? Do they exist?&nbsp;Frankly,&nbsp;I don't think it matters if they exist&nbsp;or not, no one&nbsp;needs&nbsp;the most beautiful woman in the world, no&nbsp;one&nbsp;needs a Knight in Shinning Armor. Now if you think that I will have a sentence, a single sentence, that will sum up what people really need then you are ridiculously&nbsp; mistaken. Ha.  Want some words of Wisdom? People who are Wise somehow obtained this Wisdom, But how? The answer is that they went out into the world to make mistakes.  "A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable, but more useful than a life spend doing nothing."  G'Nite ... Dream Weaver, I know you can get me through the night.  Always Yours LII  :End Log:

      :Open Log: My internet connection shot out from under me when I went to update my blog last so... sorry.  Mostly my profile was about an obsession I have... Infatuation if you will for this one girl I really like for more than body, looks or being popular. Ahh well, "There are two tragedies in life. One is not to get your heart's desire. The other is to get it." -George Bernard Shaw  Anywhom I must get back to my writting project which I did elaborate on in the lost update so ya know, if you for some reason care.... thanks technology   G'Nite.... Wildcat   Always Yours LII  :End Log:

      :Open Log:  Well everyone I am back from West Virginia and I feel great! I had a blast there, I got to know everyone from my ASP group a whole lot better and at the end of the week I felt truely happy. The sad part is that I feel myself missing everyone on the trip allready. Ah well, I am sure they are off making the best of their summer allready and not thinking about me at all... oh well I hope they know I love them.  The rest of my summer however is going to be spend Eating and Relaxing. Actually I probably will be doing alot of technical work and I will find myself running in preperation for track. My Mommy is away in Kentucky with my sister and new niece Lauren Angelina McCarrick (I can not wait to see pictures of her)  Well now I want to get back to my trip, Silly ol' me. On the van ride I was very quiet however I think that I became more of a people person as the week progressed. Warm and Fuzzie bags galore! I got to know everyone on a much deeper level and they all seemed happy to have me along, thats what really got me, I felt so included everyone told me that they were glad I was there and that I was in a much more up-beat mood this year opposed to last.  This year on ASP was probably, agreeably one of the more productive and just all together good feeling years. I will miss all of you who are going off to collage this year and I really hope to see you before you leave or when you have vacation during the year. We had so many laughs and such a great time that I do not think I can or ever will forget you. As a matter of fact I know that you will always be a huge part of my life. Thank you.  Always, Tommy Boy  :End Log:
