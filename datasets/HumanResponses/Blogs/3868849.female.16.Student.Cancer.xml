        Wow, I have had the BEST day ever! I am soooo out of my slump!!!!        &nbsp;    OK, all week long we have been voting for Ludo on Fuse, and at 5:50, Ludo was announced the winners! I literally SCREAMED!! I SCREAMED!! LoL. Then, I had to text 3 people, and write it on the message board, for an hour we were all freaking out. But, like 3 seconds before Ludo was announced the winners, Matt told me that this guy (he should remain unknown, lol) wants to produce 3 songs from Matt for&nbsp;basically nothing plus expenses then going to "shop me a record deal (with the help of his manager)!" I freaked!! OMG!! How awesome is that?!?!?!?!?!?! I couldn't be happier for him. He totally deserves it. Right now, he's concert is going on. I hope he's having fun.        &nbsp;    OMG!! I just watched FFF on Jay Leno.. **sigh**that just added to my best day. Ok, now back to my story....        &nbsp;    anyways, when I got the mail, My package from Reign Kings was there!! I ran back inside.. There was a LOT of stuff in there!! I got a signed CD, a poster that says: To Breena Our #1 Fan! Thank you!!! And I got a Bio page, and a group picture, and Iron on's and get this: a CD release pass!! It was from Feb. But that still rocks! Those guys (and girl) are soo awesome. Rhonda says that she can't wait to meet me on the Message board. Scottie is awesome too, I want to talk to the other pplz.. lol.&nbsp;&nbsp;        &nbsp;    I keep thinking about Matt, I know that he is on the top of the world. He&nbsp;deserves it. I hope his albums goes platinum 100 times :P He is soo sweet I told him I would live in LA for a year, and after thinking about it, That might be cool. I can go to an Elly K concert too :P That would be awesome. Well, I guess that's everything.        &nbsp;    ~~Breena \m/(>_

        I have had the most roller coaster week of my life so far. I hate it! Bad things first: I blocked Tony. I can't get along with him. He is sooo fake. I dunno, it's just him that I have been talking to. And all we do is argue, and, I can't be friends with someone like that. I really don't think anyone can blame me, either. And because I won't/don't talk to Tony, Phant want's nothing to do with me. Which sucks. We have such a close bond. **sigh** I am just in the worst slup. Then, people I know are online block me. It's just a bad feeling, I guess what comes around, goes around, right? I am just soo unhappy, and I have had some AMAZING things happen to me. Maybe if I talk about the good things, I'll perk up a little? Well, I have talked to Matt a lot this week. It's been really cool. He calls me "Night Owl". I love it! And since I'm ALLLLLLLLL the way in St. Louis, and he's in LA, and since he know's that I have had a rough week, he is sending me a copy of the "gig" as he put it, see, His dad records all of his shows, and I was sooo, touched that he would send me that. He is the sweetest guy I have had the pleasure of knowing. I am just so happy that I know him. Thank God for FFF to put him in the video. Speaking of FFF, I am the E-mail of the week there. For my e-mail about my birthday, I was really happy about that. Mom thought it was cool too. I can't remember if I wrote about the Reign Kings yet.. hmmm... Well, they are this incredible band from AZ, they're local, and I listened to them, and I loved it! So I joined the message board, I told Matt about it, he liked them too, Left a message on the RK board about that. Scottie, the lead singer e-mails me telling me that I have been choses the "Fan Of The Month" so they're sending me an autographed cd and Poster! They're production manager loves me, he said that I'm his new best friend, lol. Um.. what else.... actually, I think that's it........ grrrrrrrrrr. I don't feel better :(       &nbsp;   ~~Breena       &nbsp;   The feeling overwhelmed me.     I'm at the bottom of my grave.     The mud, and dirt starts falling     There is no escape     Up to my nesk.      I am paralysed.     Time to take my last breath.     My last though?     You.     Everything fades away.      Your hand reaches down     Saving me from certain death     A Halo over your head     My savior.     You.

        OK, last night was.. Odd, but I got up early and I watched Regis and Kelly to see FFF Play Devil In The Wishing Well.... Amazing. His music is so incredible I hope this becomes a big hit... And I mean BIG! But knowing the stupidty of most of America, they will say "He's sympathizing with the Devil! I'm not going to Listen to that! Devil Worshiper!!" But if they would only open their ears and Mind, they would see that the song is another way of saying "skeletons in the closet" John said himself that "...Everyone has a Devil in their Wishing Well" I hope people understand that. I am almost scared of having this be the new single. But Good news Time!!        &nbsp;    Alright, I found this AWESOME band, the Reign Kings, and I e-mailed Scottie, the lead singer, and told him my case, that being that mom would never let me buy a CD over the 'net, and yeah, and I posted on the Message Board a little, and Scottie e-mailed me back, saying the I was the fan of the month, and that he was sending out an autographed CD and Poster!! HOW AWESOME IS THAT?! And this band is incredible! He also said that he was putting in a St. Louis date, and he said that I had a "kewl" name!! This is soooo amazing! This sis why I love little known bands, they appreciate fans, they don't take fans for granted! I mean, even bigger bands like Five For Fighting don't take they're fans for granted! I am really happy right now, and I needed some more pick-me-ups.        &nbsp;    See, Tony said that he loved me and that Christy asked him to block me, but after he left, she told me that he was the one that suggested that I be blocked, I'm just sick of all this lying. It's bull. HE sent me this song, Crazy by KC and Jo Jo, and I sent him Richard Marx, Right Here Waiting... That's Shawn's song!! How could I do that to Shawn? I still Love Shawn, with all my heart.. How can I truly love Tony with Shawn still there? God, a few days ago, Tony sent me All&nbsp; My Life, too. Right now is the time that I wish I could just delete Tony, and Christy, just so I don't have to deal with lies, and un-trustworthy-ness. God, I am sooo close to doing that...        &nbsp;    I need to get a shower so I can finish moving into my new room. I slept here last night, And it was cool. I think my new room is going to work out, I can't wait to get my Autographed Reign Kings poster up!!! :)        &nbsp;    ~~Breena        &nbsp;    Maybe I can now remember that&nbsp; when I'm sad to listen to The Hoppity Song by John Ondrasik? No matter what, that song will make me smile, guaranteed ;)

        OMG, last night, I had the WEIRDEST dream! OK, I was in school, and I was in this hallway, and I looked down 2 classrooms, and Shawn was there. He was standing, and he was in full wrestling gear, but he had this jogging pants and shirt on. I don't think he had on his headgear on. But I walked over to him, and in the dream, I was still the wrestling manager, but for some reason, I couldn't go to the meet that night. So I was talking to Shawn, and he just kept saying that he was soo scared, and that he didn't know if he wanted to go to the meet that night. And he kept hugging me. So that's when I woke up, but I went back asleep, and it was like&nbsp; if you got up from watching TV to get something to eat, and you miss something on the TV show,&nbsp;cause next thing I know, we're making out! Sooooo weird!!        &nbsp;    Yeah, well, mom got me a new computer desk... Very nice! lol. And probably this week, I'll be moved into my new room!! :) I can't wait!! lol. I guess that's all for now!        &nbsp;    ~~Breena        &nbsp;      &nbsp;

        ok, so today was my 16th Birthday. My Golden Birthday (16 on the 16th). And I had to spend time with my Father.... Lord help me... It was horrible, I faked being happy the whole time, the only good thing was that I finally Heard The Beautiful by Five For Fighting, Dad had the We Were Soldiers soundtrack, so that was cool. Well, dad got me a real rose dipped in 24K Gold, which is pretty, but its a boyfriend to girlfriend gift, not father to daughter gift, I'm sorry. The other thing he got me was a CHEAP cross necklace, the cross was sooo what the word...Um...Thin. But the chain, THAT was pretty. But its all gold.. grrr! I really dislike Gold. I am a silver person, sorry. BUT he did send me a bouque of flowers. They were pretty, so did Bill and Jennifer. I called to Thank them, and to wish Jennifer a Happy Birthday too, but she is in Milwalkee :'( So I called her cell and left her a message. Ok, so I get home from dad's house at 4, and Mom still isn't home! So I get on the computer and talk to Selena and Tracy, who are SOO sweet!! Selena is like the most awesomest person ever. I love her to death! I wish she was my sister :(. But mom gets home.. She went grocery shopping..... Yeah, I know!! lol. But she doesn't want to wait for Bryan to get home, so she gives me my presents, I GOT A PALM PILOT!! It is sooo awesome. But I already over worked it, and Its kinda frozen at the moment, lol. Bryan says that I have to let the battery run out. Which sucks! Mom also got me The Butterfly Effect on DVD.. SOO cool!!! Bryan got me $25 for Hot Topic, and $25 for Streetside Records. I want to get a LOT of CD's: Lisa Loeb's Hello Lisa, Ben Folds Five's Rockin' the Suburbs, Josh Groban's Closer, Trapt's Trapt...grrr... lol. Dude.. I got NO money this year....... WITH?! lol. I'll live. Oh yeah, I wrote John Ondrasik. I told him: "I'm not 15 for a moment, and I'm not caught in between 10 and 20" it was funny. I hope he laughs. Um.. What else.. You know that I talked to Matt last night, that was awesome.. But.. No Tony :'(. I think he's gonna be mad more then me, though. He is a sweetheart, and I'm glad that I know him. I have been very fortunate lately. And I don't know why. I'm scared that something bad is going to happen. You know what I mean? Usually when something good happens, something bad happens to equal is out. So, that's why I'm scared. I believe that too.        &nbsp;    yah! I got my Palm pilot to work!! YAY!! **wipes forehead** I was worried about that!        &nbsp;    You know, I had a great birthday, but all of my friends online thought I was soo weird that I didn't have a part, or anything. And, now, thinking about it, I agree. I do regret not having a party or anything. But, when my friend "Dryve Bi" asked me who my boyfriend was, and was he taking me out to dinner, my heart sank. I should have a boyfriend right now, and I do miss not having one.        &nbsp;    ~~Breena        &nbsp;    Where am I headed      In this crazy world?      Destination Unknown      Something new      Around ever corner      Isn't growing up great?      What a wonderful life      But only if we make it so        &nbsp;    So many choices      So much anxiety      So much pain      But, so much happiness      So much joy        &nbsp;    The world is an equal place      But it depends who you are      This world can be a beautiful place      Or it can be your hell      What you do right now      Will forever effect your future      So, keep that in mind      As you grow up, and live        &nbsp;    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~        &nbsp;    Is this what you thought,      When you imagined Heaven?      Or did you think of clouds,      and forever light?      My Heaven is this,      Being in your arms tonight.

        YAY!! Its my birthday!!! lol. And right now, I'm talking to Matt through AIM. He is such a sweetheart!! And I got DSL today.. As Matt put it : "Oh Thank Goodness, its a necessity! lol" which is cool. Its so funny, I start shaking when I see him come online! Its so weird!! But Matt is a really cool person. I am really happy, and thankful that I know him. But everytime I talk to him, I'm shy and nervous.. Really not me, lol.&nbsp;So now, I'm bored, lol. OMG, I cannot believe that I am 16 now... My golden birthday!! This is really awesome. I can't wait to get my presents!! lol. Bryan told me that while him and dad were talking, dad said that he was going to get me a FERRET!! WTF?! lol. But Bryan said that he talked him into something else.. heeheehee, that's my favorite song! LMAO!! Cool, now Something Else is gonna be stuck in my head.. No complaints there! Wow.. Im goofy...er... Now I have nothing to talk about! lol. I'm listening to Austin by Blake Shelton, it's one of the sweetest songs ever. I really like it. I can't remember if I wrote about Matt's new song, it's really good too, He told me just now that he is writing new stuff..YAY!! He is amazing like that. Well, I'll write more tomorrow with what all I got :D        &nbsp;    ~~Breena        &nbsp;    I wonder what you're thinking      When you look in my direction      Are you even noticing me?      Am I alive to you at all?      A shiver runs up my spine      When&nbsp;I hear your words      Do you know that you have that affect?      My mind clutters up all spaces      Images of us, that will never be      But I am comforted by these thoughts      So I will let them be, forever      As you get older, wiser      Always know that someone,      Miles and Years apart      Will always love you      Will always feel your pain      And will always know who you really are  &nbsp;      &nbsp;

      I just read the newest entry in Elly K's diary, and in it, she said something like she would sit, drink tea, and think. SHe would wonder if what she was doing was right. She would wonder if the music indusrty was right for her, and things like theat. But when she did it last time, she stoped, and told herself that what she was thinking was wrong. She was healty, and Happy, and alive. The sky outside was still blue. She shoulden't worry so much, and was just so inspired by that. I wish that I could just escape myself, and think. But I am afraid of what I would think about. A mind can be very dangerous, and if used improperly, can be just horrible. I just wish that I could dive deep into thought, and just answer personal questions. But when I try, all I see is darkness, or a face of someone I know... Is that bad? Or is it just that I am young, and I shoulden't see anything powerful yet? Thinking so much, and writeing about Elly is making me crave tea.. lol. And I hate tea!! lmao.  Alright, I have returned with Tea.. I haven't tried it yet, too Hot, and it's still mixing. It smells wonderful though. I had to get the one with Peppermint in it.. my favorite! I can smell the lemon in it too.. yummy! Still too hot for me, though.. I know, Im a wuss, oh well ;) ANd it's strange, Im listening to Purple Sky by Elly, and it has an amazing piano chords in it, and smelling all the different things in the tea.. and its soo calming. I just tried the Tea, and it is really good, a little too watery, but thats my fault, haahaahaa. But the warmth is just coating my throat. Now I know why Elly does this!  I'm gonna become a Caramal Latte and Tea person, lol. Thanks, Elly. :)  OK, now back to my title question: What am I Doing With My Life? I am 15, 16 on Friday, and I know what I  want  to do with my life. I want to be a Criminal Profiler for the F.B.I in New Jersey, and I will be taking classing for that this year, and I have a feeling that I will acheive this, but, right now. Today, Tomorrow, what am I doing with my life? I stay at home all day, I never go out with friends, I don't really have any good friends. And for a 16 year old thats scary and sad. I have never been out on a date, the last movie I saw was... Darkness Falls. The last phone call I got was like a week after school let out. The only thing I can do right now is hope that with me joinging the Tennis team, and me being more social, I can get some friends. I know that in College, I plan on being different. I want to be the person I want to be. And I think that if I am away from my past, and.... well... family, I can acheive that. The person I want to be is me, just more self confident, more likable. I want to be happy with who I am, and what I look like. I just want to be content with myself. I want to look in a mirror, and be happy with what I see, and know that if given the oppertunity, I still woulden't change a thing about me. Is that really so hard? Is that wish so impossible to be granted? I almost think that the things I want can never be acheived, like something is keeping me grounded, and ... unhappy. I could never guess what, though. No matter what obsticals I face, I just want to be happy with my choices. I want to be able to look back at my life, and smile. I just don't want to regret anything, but I already do when I look back. I regret not telling Shawn how I really feel. And I will regret that every day for the rest of my life. I know that. I said something a long time ago, and I remember it word for word:  "I will just let fate take its couse, and let destiny navagate." " I hope I always remember that. I think it was one of those once in a lifetime quotes that you think of, you know? Well, I think I have said all that I need to say, and my Tea is gone :) yummy, lol. The last drink is the best, all the flavor!  ~~Breena  P.S. Is there a poem in my mind somewhere?  When I die, let me go There is no use for those tears Save them for someone else They do not help me When I die, Say goodbye Then never remember my name I am gone for good Never to return But when I die Remember my words The rest is fate We will disappear eventually Like the wild wind  Eh.. not my best, but what can you do?

      OK, So the April Wine concert on Friday with Thad and his family, it was an awesome concert. But we have to wait FOREVER for the "meet-n-greet", so that finally ends, and we say "Hi" and catch up with everything. Myles actually says hi to me and hugs me. Thad and Ryan are awe struck, But it was really cool. We finally say our goodbyes at, like 12:30-12:45, Jerry kiss my goodbye on the cheek, and the whole ride home, I can feel his beard on my cheek. Well, I finally go to bed at 1:45, and at 6:60 the next morning, mom wakes me up, and asks if I want to go with her to Illinois to see them that night. Of course I go! So I listen to their greatest hits CD the whole way there to learn the lyrics better. I am soo tired when we get there, and I call Brian's cell to find out where they are staying, and it is the NICEST place! But they have no rooms available! But she checks again, and says that if we wait one hour, we can have a COTTAGE!! I was like: OH MY GOD!! LOL. And the cottage is soo nice! It has a kitchen and a bathroom bigger then MY room! The couch turned into a sofa sleeper, which was awesome. So we nap in preparation of the concert. When we get up, we go to a bar and grill to eat.. Mine was....... Eh. LOL. But I do eat, and when we come back, there is a message on our phone from Jerry wanting us to join him at the "oyster bar" across the street. We meet up with him, and since we already ate, I ordered a key lime pie and a latte. It was soo good! But the Latte was bad, LOL.  So that was really fun. When we get back the stage crew that Jerry was going to the stage with are gone. He goes upstairs to call them to find out what's going on, and me and mom stay downstairs to wait, while doing that, we finally see Brian and Myles. We talk for awhile and Jerry comes back, and us 3 go down there. And we find out that its an out door festival for handicapped children, and Bikers are all we see! It was actually scary! So the concert starts at 9:30 and Brian gets us onstage next to Jerry and behind the stage hand. It was a blast! But after Jerry's awesome solo, I could tell that something was wrong with him.. He was just sick looking. I kept asking mom if he was ok, and I knew that he wasn't. But he keeps playing, and after "Roller" He gets up to stretch, or whatever, I'm looking ahead at the crowd and Brian and Jerry, when these two stage hands say "OH MY GOD!! JERRY FELL!!" I look over, and I see Jerry's hands grasping the side of the stage that is about 5 foot in the air. I run down the stairs and he is up, but he is soo disoriented, he is almost dizzy looking. But he gets back onstage, and plays two more songs! The man is 65 years old! I had never been so scared in my life. So the concert ends, and he goes back to the trailer they have for them, and a line forms for autographs, and Jerry signs them, he can barely stand! He says that he is going back to the hotel with us, Brian says that he is going with them, but he ends up going back with us. The had to get a golf cart to drive him the 10 feet to our car.. That's how bad it was! About 30 minutes after he is in his room, he calls for mom to rub his back for him, she won't let me go. When she comes back, she says that he has no bruises on him, but he is soo sore. We don't get up in time to say goodbye to the band, which sucks, but when we get home, me and mom pass out! I sleep on the couch from 3:30 till 9:30 then from that in my own room till 9:30 this morning! But earlier, mom called Jerry in Canada, and he is ok, just bruised on his legs. He had a concert again last night, he is incredible! But I thank God that I didn't see him fall. I would not be the same, I can promise you that!  On to more pleasant things; Matthew recorded another song: Anxiety, it is sooo awesome!! But what isn't by him? LOL. Um.. I had a weird dream with my friend Kyle that I do NOT want to go into details, LOL.  I came upon a horrible reality, I find myself forgetting things about Shawn already. I can't remember his voice, and that terrifies me. I remember everything else, but not his voice.... That's like a dagger piercing my heart. I can't believe this.. I am soo afraid that I will forget something else. I can remember his laugh, his smile, his eyes, his cologne. But not his voice, its like, a movie, you know? You remember the script, but not the actor saying it. **sigh** This hurts so bad. Oh Well, I'll hear him again in 2 months.... I hope.  ~~Breena  P.S. Im gonna write more poems.  "Blink" When giving up is your last option And there is no looking back In a blink you're gone When a smile cannot be achieved And tears will not stop In a blink you're gone When the end is near And life has just begun When the silence laughs And trees whisper In a blink you're gone for good When your heart breaks And your world crumbles When you're naked- vulnerable And no one takes advantage In a blink you're gone When everything goes right And you're finally happy In a blink you're gone  I really like that one!!  Shine your light On the dark corners of my soul Try and find What you have been looking for If you find it Let me know, for I have been searching too Fight everything The dragon, and beasts of the past Break through chains That keep me away from a deserving life Carry me though The fire and decay of my dreams Save me From the torture I give myself  100 Tears Every tear, a memory A smile, a look, a laugh One hundred tears Two years.. a lifetime Gone in a heartbeat... Much like life But a heart so guarded Has to come under attack Sooner then later When the white flag is waved Everything is over Its so hard to live With your face in my mind Your laugh in my ears Your touch on my skin Your smile in my eyes Your voice in my dreams The moon wishes me luck The stars mock my foolish ways Tears fall, memories coming back Eyes closing, preparing To do it all again   Angel  How do you explain When an Angel touches your life It's a feeling that stay with you until the day you die You came when I needed you the most You showed me that My life ment something Then you disappeared As quickly as you arrived The feeling you gave me Will never fade away I stay awake dreaming That I will see you again But knowing you are gone forever I'll remember everything about you forever I can never forget you Or what you did for me But how do you explain  When an Angel touches your life...

      Ok, so I'm talking to my best friends Tony and Christy, Christy hates Tony, visa-versa.. FUN!! And Tony just told me that he proposed to his girlfriend Megan, and I'm happy for him. I honestly am. I hope they have a wonderful life. And to think, when Tony logged on, I  HATED  him, lol. Now we're buddies! Its weird to explain. He is the best friend that I have always wanted, and so is Christy. I am very happy to have them in my life. Tony is just the BEST guy friend, and Christy is the best girl friend. They are both older then me, but oh well. I love them to death. grrrrrr, i need to write, I'm bored, but I have nothing to write about, I could write about Shawn, bt I don't want to mess up the website :P Hm........ What to talk about...... Ok, tomorrow, I'm seeing this band: April Wine, they have been family friends for YEARS, and I was kinda named after them. See, mom named my brother after Brian and Myles: Bryan, and the female version of Bryan is Breena.. my name, lol. ANd they are the nicest ppl. They always make sure we have seats when they come here, and one of them ususally gives me guitar pics and stuff like that. Jerry is my fav. He's the drummer. I wish he was my dad. I really do, oh there's something to write about, by scumbag father, but he is a waste of energy to type, so no. lol I woulden't mind writing poems here too. I think I'll give that try.  God must really want me to happy to have put you here For you always make me smile Yet you always make me cry You showed me that life was worth living But made me want to die. Only a matter of time before my heart expodes One hug from you would ease all of that You're hundreds of miles away Your heart is even farther away You have shown me love You have shown me pain But God still must love me for making you  Thats all for now.  ~~Breena

      I'm listening to his song: Nothin' Left To say by Richard Marx, and it has a good point: "Why Waste Tomorrow, Chasing yesterday" I think I need to listen to that quote.  I'm trying, clawing at yesterday, trying to go back to.. Well, everything. I think I'm afraid of the future. I'm afraid to let go. I want to stay right where I am. I don't want tomorrow to come. I don't want to wake up in the morning, afraid of what is ahead of me. I don't want to move forward, I would rather step backwards, to when I saw Shawn everyday, to when I stayed after school every day until 5, doing what I love, to when everything was less complicated. I think I'm happy, but what is happy? It's more then a feeling, I know that. And it's more then a hollow smile. You are just happy, It's like jumping into water, Happiness just covers you. It embraces you. But what if you can't swim? What if happiness is an illusion? But I have been happy. Saturday, I was happy. When I was around Shawn, I was happy, and when I was managing the  Wrestling team, I was happy. I know I was. But how do I achieve happiness now? All those things are gone. Saturday- was the past, Shawn- hundreds of miles away. Wrestling- who knows if I'll do it next year? I want it to be Saturday soo badly again. I want to be hugging my hero again. I was to feel.... Overwhelming happiness. I don't think I'm asking a lot. I really don't.  I'm looking at the picture of me and John Ondrasik. And a smile graces my face. I cannot help it. I was soo happy then. I want to be like that again. I was to feel like I'm supposed to. I'm going to be 16 in eight days, and I don't feel like I should. I should be soo happy, but I'm not. What if I am never happy again? I know that I will be.. But what if? See, right now, life is passing me by. While I'm sitting here, sulking over my life, others are having the best times, they are out enjoying their life while they still have one. It's soo sad.  When I met John, instead of calling my best friend, I got on the internet, and told my best friend, and I posted about it on 3 message boards.... How sad.... This school yeah, I will be different, I will go out with friends, I will be social. People will like me this year, and **gasp** I might get a guy! Wow, Breena, don't get to ahead of yourself. ~~I have to change myself before anything else will change.~~ I  like the way that sounds. Alright, I'm done sulking for now ~~Breena

      I just had a fight with my best friend, Christy. I feel horrible... But I honestly don't think I'm too much at fault. Gosh, that sounds worse! Now, on to listening to my music (right now "Waitin' On a Sunny Day" by Bruce Springsteen) But will it work? Only time will tell. As John Ondrasik said when I met him: These are the best days of my life. And its true, but I don't have enough of a life to make anything of it. When school starts, thingh will HAVE to change.. They have to! I have to make a life worth living. If not, I'm going to end up all dried up and mean. I need friends other then over the internet. I mean, my best friend is over 100 miles away, and 10 years older then me. What the hell? I am just soo disappointed in the way my life is turning out. I want a change, I want to get a phone call. I want to go out with friends.. Or **gasp** a guy! I just want something different. And I am happy, I know this, but I want to be  happy  you know? I guess not, I'm talking to a freaking computer! Wow, I am pathetic. I should get out my yearbook, and call someone... But I  HATE  calling people! I don't know why, I just don't like calling people. Another thing I want different. **sigh** I need to go out to the Mills.  I guess the only thing that will cheer my up would be talking about the love of my life: Shawn Knobelock. He is soo amazing. I can't believe that he is in Maryland with the Army. He is gone for 3 months, and I know that I will most likely never see him. But "Even though ending are never ever happy, It's the happy moments along the way, that in the end make it ok" John Ondrasik strikes again! LoL. Gosh, It's already past 1:00am... Weird. But I feel I need to talk about Shawn to cheer me up.. But what memory.. My favorite one was at the home tournment. I was at a table, scoring, and he was next to me. He was the time keeper. He wore a skull cap... susprisingly good on him. He kept hitting me with the towel... oh God, Trapt just came on my LaunchCast radio station.. I'll get to that later.. But anyways, that night, I know he was flirting with me.. Why couldn't I act on it? We might be together now if only I had acted! I'm an idiot, I know. OK, now onto Trapt. Everytime Trapt plays, I want to cry. See, one tournment, Shawn borrowed my CD player to listen to the Self Titled Trapt CD. He had to warm up, so he gave me back my CD player and said "You should listen to it, its an ok CD." So I did, and I loved it. Now, everytime I hear a Trapt song, I think of Shawn.. And I want to cry soo badly! He will NEVER know how much he means to me. I can see myself growing old with him. I can see us with Kids, and everything imaginable... Is it an illusion? It can't be. I cannot believe that. I just pray that I get another one of Shawn's hugs. They are so precious now. I wish I could remember every detail of him. I know that I can't ever forget his ice blue eyes, or his smile, or his laugh, or his smell of his cologne. I could be doing anything, then, just for a split second, I'll smell his cologne, then it will be gone, and I strain to smell it again. And my heart breaks. I cannot help it. Well, It's late, I need to go.  ~~Breena

      Alright, let me just start at Saturday. I met my hero. John Ondrasik of Five For Fighting. He had a concert at the fair St. Louis thing. It was an amazing concert. It completely changed the way I listen to FFF. All the songs he played just seem different. I was front row, center. John and met made eye to eye contact a lot of times. It was amazing. Let me try to remember the songs played: NYC Weather Report Devil In The Wishing Well Bella's Birthday Cake Angels & Girlfriends 100 Years Easy Tonight Maybe I Something About You If God Made You The Taste Superman (It's Not Easy) Nobody The concert was a blast! And John is an amazing person. I hope and pray to God that I am lucky enough to meet him again. He is truly my hero, and I hope for nothing but greatness for him. And if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have meet Matt, who is also amazing  urlLink   And he is the SWEETEST guy! And through Matthew, I found Elly K, who is also awesome. Both are piano/keyboard/singers/songwriters (wow! LOL) urlLink   Anyways, I need to be going. I'll Write later!  ~~Breena
