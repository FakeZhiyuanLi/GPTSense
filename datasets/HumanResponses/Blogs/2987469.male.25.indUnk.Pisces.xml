      So, it's Thursday, late afternoon here in Los Angeles and the temperature today has been in the low eighties (that's high twenties for those of you in the UK who prefer Celsius!). I'm told that this weather is unseasonably warm for this time of year, but I can't get over how fantastic it is to be able to wear a t-shirt in March! The downside is that the office is actually quite cold because of the air conditioning.  Work is going very well, although there is much for me to learn. I guess I figured that because my job here would be similar to my old job in London, that I would slip into it, but in actual fact things are done quite differently on this side of the pond. It's good though, as it really feels like a fresh start. It also feels weird as I haven't had a new job in almost six years, so I have that new job feeling of not knowing anyone and having to be shown where the kitchen is etc. The building where I work houses many other company's and there is an in house gym, restaurant (where lunch can be purchased) and an outdoor volleyball court complete with sand (!). There is also a huge car park and in a perfect way to demonstrate how the car is king in L.A., there is no way to enter the complex on foot.....you actually have to walk in through the car park entrance, stepping under the ticket barriers!  The weekend is fast approaching, which means that tomorrow I get to pick up my lovely new car (photos to follow as soon as I get it). For the past couple of weeks, I've been driving a hire car, so I'll be glad to get rid of that. I also want to do some more exploring of Los Angeles, as I have spent most of my time in and around the Burbank area. I hope to go and visit the ocean and actually walk barefoot on the sand, and perhaps watch the sun set over the water (I hope you're all suitably jealous). I will make sure I take photos of that too.  Well, I must away now, to go revel some more in how great this place is. So until next time, this is MT signing out from beautiful downtown Burbank, California.

      On Saturday I picked up my lovely new car and took advantage of the hot weather, by zooming down the coast with the roof down and the stereo turned right up. Even when the sun went down and it got a bit chilly I was able to put the windows up and the heated seats on. It is most definitely the nicest car I have ever driven, let alone owned! And to think that it only costs about £15 to fill up with petrol.....in the UK it would cost £35-£40!! Petrol is yet another thing that costs next to nothing here, but the funny thing is that whenever I mention to Angelinos how cheap petrol is, they look at me in shock, as the cost here has doubled in the last year thanks (as far as I am aware) to Gov. Arnie's attempts to sort out the economy. They look even more shocked (or maybe sick!) when I tell them that in the UK we pay almost $6 per gallon (yes I've done all the math!), compared to their $2. In a city (and country!) where the car is huge (both literally and metaphorically) this is a not a pleasant thought for them!  However on my way home on Saturday night, I was driving through a quiet residential area near my apartment, when suddenly I see blue and red flashing light in my rear view mirror. It seems that as I have just bought the car, the date and year stickers on the license plate (which indicate when the car is registered until, a kind of road tax) are out of date. No drama, as have temporary documentation and am completely street legal, but it's a little scary as the  armed   police officer shines a flashlight in my face and demands "license, registration and proof of insurance". He turned out to be very nice and all was resolved without need for physical violence or prison time. Suffice it to say I drove pretty carefully for the rest of the journey!

      My latest purchase is something that I now don't think I could ever live without.   I bought a TIVO  urlLink  , a Digital Video Recorder for those for you not up on the latest gadgets. This cunning little box of tricks sits neatly under my TV and allow me to effortlessly(without the need for tapes) record programs to disk. I can also use it to schedule programs up to two weeks in advance and (and this is the really cool part) can also set it to record a series no matter when the program is on. For example I have programmed it to record "The Simpsons", the box will record every upcoming episode regardless of when it is on and will store them together. Throw in the fact that you can search for programs by title, actor, director etc, recording programs has never been easier! I really think I should get a commission from Tivo. My box will hold 80 hours of programs (40 hours and 140 hour versions are also available) and when it gets full, you can either delete programs to free up space or archive off onto video. Plus you also have the ability to pause live TV that you're watching or rewind up to 30 minutes. It really is a marvel!  It's one of those things that I thought would be a total gimmick, but now I'm not sure I could live without it. I highly recommend it to anyone, especially if you are sick of there never being anything to watch on TV when you want to watch it. With this, you also know that Tivo will have a library of programs for you to watch.  It's a lovely sunny day here, but I'm off to watch some TV!!!

      It's been six weeks, but at last I've got organised enough to take some photos of my apartment and upload them. As you can see I have also included an "action shot" or two of me enjoying the space.  urlLink Sofa ,   urlLink Bed ,   urlLink Kitchen ,  urlLink Lounging    urlLink Balcony

      Well it looks like my digital camera has finally given up the ghost. I went to turn it on the other day and got the worst thing one can expect from an electronic device.....an error message!! Error 18 to be precise, which according to one website....  "is the worst that can happen to an owner of the Canon IXUS" ....great! It then went on to say  "If the warranty of the camera has ran out it's not worthwhile to repair it by Canon in most cases. With a little luck you can repair the damage by yourself..".  No problem I thought, I'm not beaten yet....so I took it apart, followed the instructions to the letter and put it back together and to my amazement.....it still doesn't work.  So it looks like I'll be popping down to the local  urlLink bestbuy and be picking me up a new digital camera.   That all said I do remember Toby a few years back spilling champagne on the camera in question. It is possible this technical failure is a delayed reaction. Toby you and me need to talk!

      I have now been in LA for over two months. 67 days to be precise. That's nine and half weeks. Unfortunately my life since moving here, whilst thoroughly enjoyable, cannot be compared to the film of the same name even though my fridge is packed with all sorts of interesting food. Anyway....my point is that the time has flown and whilst it doesn't seem that long, when I think back so much has happened since I arrived and London seems a long way away.   The funny thing is that while I miss my friends and family, I don't feel lonely here despite my lack of new friends (see above comparison to 9 & 1/2 weeks!). Right now, I'm enjoying my own company and discovering LA on my own. I am confident that soon enough that feeling will be replaced by a sense of being alone, but I am determined to create a new social circle here before that gets too bad.  This weekend I have enjoyed a typical Miles lazy weekend, which involves not getting up until late, not getting dressed until late and generally mopping around the apartment, drifting from Xbox to TV to computer etc. Sounds pretty cool eh? It's the kind of weekend that I found very easy to live when in London and the kind that I also found the most depressing. I was determined to try and snap out of the habit when I arrived here, but looks like I am slipping back into it. It's not without it degree of fun and sometimes it's nice to simply do nothing. I don't feel bad about staying indoors when it's sunny for example, since it's sunny everyday....this is California after all! But that all said, next weekend I am going to do something different.....or should that be...do   something  !  In fact I have started a list of things to do while I am here and while I have the time. Be it places to visit, films to see, books to read, starting a fitness regime (yes I know there are doubters among you, but it will happen....there's a gym in my apartment building for Christ sake!!) and I will slowly but surely cross each one off as and when I do them. I feel like I suddenly have so much more time, which is a surprisingly pleasurable and not at all daunting.   If I could only find the time to do those dishes from the week before last.....

      This weekend I am going to the  urlLink Doheny Heritage Music Festival  which is being held on teh beach just south of L.A. It's a huge open air blues festival and headlining this year is none other than the one, the only, the godfather of soul...Mr James Brown.  It should be a lot of fun and hoepfully the weather will be good, allowing for much open air drunkeness and frivolity.  I will upload some photos (from a borrowed camera, mine is still knackered) when I get back.

      Well, we all had a lot of fun down on the beach in Dana Point. The festival was a big success and the weather, which was looking like it might be distinctly British, was lovely and Californian after all. I can especially feel it on my sunburnt nose and forehead!  There was lots of cool music, from various diverse blues artists and James Brown was a lot of fun to see in person, even though I think he is now verging on senility! .....he kept singing "stab it...stab it...stab it" at one point??!!  The festival was held in a small state beach in the middle of  urlLink "The O.C."  or Orange County as normal people call it. It really is the Surrey of SoCal, full of rich housing estates, golf courses and smart restaurants. The particular place we were staying had a marina and more German cars then Stuttgart. Still, all in all a fairly nice place for a music festival.  Th only major problem was that you weren't allowed to bring any food or drink into the festival and they were charging $5 for a small glass of Miller (!). That made the weekend quite expensive, but still fun.  Click for larger pictures...

      On Friday I had to relive one of the defining moments of my life. In order to be street legal in the US, I have to have a California drivers license and in order to get one of those I had to take my driving test...again!  8 years ago when I first went through the whole horrible process in the UK, the angst and profuse sweating was offset by the knowledge that I would never have to go through it again. Well, 8 years later, at the age of 25, there I was. The one major difference is that when one first takes their test, it is such a rite of passage, moving you one step closer to adulthood, one step closer to total independence. I think it's safe to say that I am fairly independent these days, so there was no huge pressure for me to pass (unlike the hundreds of sixteen year olds that were taking their test on the same day). That said, whilst I think I am a good driver and wasn't overlay concerned about failing, the whole experience did bring back some bad memories!  Luckily the actual test consisted of driving around the block (no three point turns, no parallel parking) and I only failed on a couple of points (I hit a dog or something).  Anyway, hopefully this time, I can say "this will be the last time I have to ever take my driving test"!
