      Well, here in suburbia we worship the modern convinces such as cell phones, over priced coffee, and dry cleaning services, to name a few. Everything from our toothbrushes to our tacky lawn ornaments are all   intended   to enrich our very existences. One item, however, is just a menace to society. The shopping cart. Well, I have herd them called a "buggy" before but that term is to cute for such an evil item as a shopping cart.  May I present exhibit A: The Shopping Cart     Yes, I did a good job finding a particularly menacing picture of one didn't I? Thank god for Google images! Anywhoo, As I said, SHOPPING CARTS ARE EVIL! First of, if the rare occasion I'm in the store, and actually need enough crap to require a cart, I'm always cursed with the lame one. You know which one I'm talking about, with the front wheel that just spins around and skids when to take a corner to sharply and/or to fast, sending you crashing into the display of fabric softener sheets. Hey, It could be worse, daresay pineapples? And of course previous user of this said cart, we will call him "Hick Bob-Joe" who needed it to get his 6 pack of beer to his pick-up truck (god-for-bid he carry it and get exercise) set this six pack on top of some fresh produce he was picking up for his darlin' wife back at home, leaving me an attractive prize the check out clerk (maybe our friend Kari) wasn't quite sure how to ring up, much less identify. Meanwhile, Soccer Mom gets the spiffy cart that looks like a choo-choo train so her brats will have fun riding around the store. Of course this one has well oiled and maintained wheels, as to not endanger the passengers, a.k.a. future check out aisle clerks, Who will fill the summer positions so they can learn some responsibility. And who are we kidding, earn some extra money for their Pokemon cards and other grossly over priced fad items.   May I present exhibit B: My Car     Ohhhh Ahhhh! Ain't it special? Not really. But now it has a new unintended feature. A nice scratch left by, you guessed it, a SHOPPING CART! Now, what's funny is this happened while my car was parked at the library. Yes, the LIBRARY! Why are there shopping carts in the library parking lot? My main theory is that the library use to be a Safe Way store. Yes, how trashy is that? They just changed Dairy to Non-Fiction, thrifty eh? Ok anyway, some of the shopping carts for what ever reason remain in the parking lot. Nobody has taken the time to round them up and put them somewhere. So these wandering shopping carts continue to haunt the parking lot slamming into unsuspecting cars! Lovely I know.  Ok, I have no idea where I'm going with this.  Corn

      There's this woman who works with me who hates me because I took her pencil holder by accident. I was simply looking for some office supplies one day and saw one sitting on this counter type thing in the office hallway. It was a decent looking pencil holder.. the type with separate compartments for post-its and paper clips. I would say it was a high-end pencil holder. And it didn't seem to be owned by anyone. Why else would it be sitting in the hallway? So I grabbed it and brought it to my office and put it on my desk. I then filled it with various pens and highlighters.   The next day the woman in question came in to my office to speak to me about something and when she saw the pencil holder on my desk, she gave me a really dirty look. At first I didn't put 2 and 2 together. But now, months later, I realize that the reason she has been ignoring me when she sees me or flat out scowling at me is because the pencil holder was hers and was just in the hallway temporarily. I was having lunch with a co-worker and I said "You know, I don't think Lisa likes me and I think it's because I took her pencil holder by accident". My co-worker nodded and said "Yes, that's right.. you took her pencil holder without asking." Turns out Lisa had told everyone at work about how I swipped her precious pencil holder right out from under her nose like a common criminal.   Needless to say I gave the pencil holder back. It seems to have somewhat smoothed things over with it's rightful owner but I know there will always be pencil-holder tension between us. So much for sanity.

      So that everyone doesn't wonder what's up with me, I'm on vacation. There, I said it. See me in about a week.... *grins*  Ok, that said, what is the deal with hangnails? Am I the only person who seems to get these dang-blasted things more often than anyone else, and why is it that when I try to get rid of them, I end up hurting myself more (don't ask)?  It is my thought du jour.   Enjoy.....

         I was going through all of my photos on the old computer today and found this picture of my cats.  Altogether I have about 15 photos of them cuddled up together on my computer (can we say obsessive?) but this one is my favorite.  Feel free to ooh and ahh in the comments section, and if you don't like cat pictures just be thankful that I didn't post all 15.

       urlLink Comedian Elvira Kurt's web site   I usually don't declare "favorites" of anything. Not music. Not movies. Not books. It's just not my nature to be so exclusive. I have various things for my various moods and something I may love one minute may not "hit the spot" the next.  I make one category exception for declaring a favorite. My favorite comedian is Elvira Kurt. This cutie-patootie lesbian just cracks me up! Visit her website and click "TV Special" to see what I mean.

      I took this week off hoping for some rest and relaxation.  The plan was to work on my tan at the beach, ride a roller coaster or two, and spend quality time with the family.  Work has been really stressing me out lately to the point where I have to drag myself in.  Since I get bored easily I figured a few days at home would be enough to inspire me to like my job again.  Plans, even well thought out ones, don't work out sometimes.  Here it is Friday and I've accomplished next to nothing.  I didn't make it to the beach, our trip to the amusement park was canceled twice, and Aldo has been working like crazy all week so I've barely seen him.  I'm sitting at home bored out of my mind, and the idea of going into work still makes me wretch.  Other than the fact that my house is clean and I've finally gotten around to catching up on some business related things the week feels like a waste.  Tomorrow it's back into the city.  The job isn't the problem but the idea of spending yet another day fixing things for an incompetent floor manager is just depressing.  Come fall I plan to leave and focus almost exclusively on voiceovers and the new company, but getting through the summer is proving to be more of a challenge then I once thought.    What's really sad is that I used to love what I did, and still do enjoy the actual work part.  I like dealing with tourists.  The fast pace of things is intense, but it also kept me motivated.  I'm also really good at what I do, but try as I might I can't seem to master the skill of being patient with a couple of moronic managers.  I'm not sure where to end this.  Mostly I just wanted to vent I guess.  Despite how I'm feeling today (which admittedly is due in part to PMS) I hold out hope that next week will be better.

       bo·he·mi·an   n.     A person with artistic or literary interests who disregards conventional standards of behavior.    (what an intro, hunh?)  Don't get me wrong. It's not like you could braid my leg or armpit hair (although I suppose if you really, really wanted to, you could, but it might be difficult). I'm not 'bohemian' in that sense of the word. I'm bohemian in that I don't  conform ; I don't follow  convention . It's just not in my nature to cow down to someone and bend my will to suit theirs.  Trust me, I've tried. My failed marriage of 5.5 years is a good example of how hard I tried, how much I was willing to be unhappy within myself because I cared about (dare I say "love"?) the man I married. I wanted to make everyone happy, everyone but me. I worried about stupid, needless things, like whether his Mom liked a gift I was going to get/got for her. With hindsight, I should've told them all to stick it where the sun doesn't shine and do my own thing which is what I am prone to do, but I could feel the disapproval, see the looks in my eyes. I wanted them to like me, but I forgot that I had to like me first.   Now, you might be wondering, how on earth did I ever get to this conclusion that I exhibit bohemian tendencies? In a roundabout way, it happened as I was talking with a friend of mine last night who has known me since my high school days. We were talking about my stbx-husband, and my relationship with the stbx. My friend told me that, of the two of us (stbx and myself), I was the stronger one. I looked after Dave in my own fashion, making important decisions, taking responsibilty for everything in our relationship. I just did it unconventionally. He didn't look after me, short of paying a few bills, and he didn't give me the mental support that I desperately craved and needed.  I'm a demanding person, perhaps to the point of exacting. I'm selfish - I want 100% of your attention, your devotion, and sometimes, your time. I admit to those things. I also expect a lot from my friends. But from my friends, if I demand and expect from them, I give 110% back, no questions asked.   With hindsight, I suppose one of the reasons why I tried so hard to be conventional was the fact that I haven't  been  conventional. I've always been labelled - different, weird, strange, not normal - and for once in my life, I just wanted to blend into the crowd, to not draw attention to myself. As a writer and artist (I do draw on occassion), I should've known better than to try to be something I'm not.  But then again, society these days seems to breed sheep. Where's the Soma ?

      I'm on a mission.  I've decided to dedicate a good portion of my time and effort to protest against the C2 movement.  I wholeheartedly believe that it represents what is most seriously wrong about our culture: the commercials, the concept, the taste.  Everything is bad.  For those of you who regularly watch TV or listen to the radio, I'm sure you've heard a commercial or two about C2.  They play the oldie-but-goodie "You Can't Always Get What You Want," phrasing an unpleasant scenario in which you hypothetically must put yourself out to help out your best friend, your neighbor, your parents, your pets.  They float the entire campaign on the fact that C2 has half the calories and half the carbohydrates of regular Coca-Cola, and all the taste, so now you CAN get what you want -- guilt-free taste.  Look, ladies and gentlemen.  I've been against this Atkins craze since the beginning of its media frenzy.  There is absolutely nothing healthy about ketosis (the state of shock your body goes into when it is denied carbohydrates).  I fervently believe that this "low-carb" craze is just selling Americans what they always think they want: effortless instant gratification.  If you want to lose weight, get off your lazy ass and exercise.  That's the only thing we're going to have to do as a culture in order to not be laughed at by other countries around the world.  We can't cut this and add that...we learned that with the low-fat diets.  Usually when you cut down on one thing, you add twice as much of another; Snackwell's has no fat, sure, but it's got tons of sugar.  Steak sauteed in butter and smothered in A1 has no carbs, sure, but do you want to know what it's doing to your aorta?  So I say this.  America, get over yourselves.  You can't biggie-size ANYTHING and expect to not pay for it in one way or another.  Fries will give you a heart attack eventually.  If you sue someone because you're too stupid to use your common sense, the entire economy suffers.  Small-town doctors are going out of business because they can't afford malpractice insurance, and before we know it we're going to sue ourselves out of affordable medical coverage.  The price of food is going up because everybody has to hire researchers to figure out exactly how some idiot in Buttfuckville could use said product to hurt themselves and sue for kajillions.  It's just not easy...so deal with it and move on.  As far as C2, I say to you...don't drink it.  It symbolizes all that's wrong with our culture and more.  Oh, and it tastes like ass.  I tried it.  Nasty, nasty shit.  You've been warned.

         There was a life before Hercules SmartCard, and I dare say it was a simpler, finer life. It was a life involving cadging quarters, instead of say, buying "The New York Sun" every single day, or say, instead of hoping to land the yellow-marked baseball prize gumball in the machine in front of the Russian guy's shoe repair store on 4th Avenue, the one where you have to turn the whole damn thing over to get your damn gum out, sheesh Alik, fix the goddang gumball machine,  tvoyu mat' ... Occasionally, in the days before Hercules SmartCard you would even have to go to Chemical Bank, no I mean Chase Bank, no I mean JPMorgan Chase Bank, and ask the lady for a roll of quarters. She would gaze at you sympathetically. You would sheepishly hand her your rolls of pennies. She would ask you if you would like to sign up for a credit card. You would say, no, thank you, I have a bunch hehehehe.  She would smile sweetly, enigmatically pointing to the sign in tiny writing on her window, "A cheerful countenance turneth away wrath."   But in those days Before Hercules SmartCard (BHC), those lyrical idyllic days, you had a bunch of quarters, say, oh, about $8.00 worth would do it, and you would go down in the laundy room after using like 3 keys for the elevator and the double locked doors, and you would push these not-really-silver but-still-worth-something-in-the-real-world physical metallic spheres into an awaiting physical slot-in-the-real-world and walla, the machine would more or less start, more or less every time, and you could leave your laundry while you went to read "The Sun," which yes, Aldo, forms the center of my morning existence (*gasp* you mean I don't pay cash for that *blog* called "The Times")  In that BHC era, quarters were things-in-themselves, laundry was a thing-in-itself...we never had to enter cyberspace...we never had to lose touch with the Earth...we never had to think about how to connect up...we never had to think about elusive debits and credits in the sky...we never had to think about somebody tracking our movements...we never had to think about people in Bangalore...we never had to think, most importantly, that our actual laundry-in-itself might not get done. But all that's changed now. Now we have Hercules SmartCard. Now we are in the AHC era, and it's a bitch, I'm here to tell you, not unlike, nay, quite akin to, the Horror of Wal-Mart ( cf  Corn). First, observe the slightly raised gold bit of foil on the plastic Hercules SmartCard provided by Management, with a bit of wiring or webbing...you can't help but compulsively rub it over and over again with your thumb in the hopes it might help it "work better" even though you know that runs contrary to all common sense and even what you learned about sensitive weights and measures in a lab in a factory in Penn Yan, NY where you could see that the oil on your fingerprints can throw off the most *sensitive* calibrations...Now you have lost control...of life..the Earth...your laundry...because all the quarters are gone, the slots are gone, the investment is gone, the rolls are gone, the lady's sympathetic gaze is gone, and Alik is happy because now you can feed his machine way more often than you used to and soon you will be making Dr. Mansky, the dentist even MORE happy lol.   Because Hercules SmartCard is Here To Do It All For You. After staring at what might affectionately be called "the Dashboard" in your formery-familiar laundry room, all bearings lost, all bets off, you finally figure out that with a deft flick of the wrist, you can both stuff the Hercules SmartCard into its awaiting slot in that special way that only it wants AND you can press "ADD VALUE" and figure only $20 would be worth risking AND simulaneously with your *other* hand push in your debit card and prepare to use your *third hand* for punching in your password...OK, not surprising it didn't work, you only have 2 hands, too bad for YOU sucker. $20 has disappeared off your debit card, to be sure...but it is Out There In Cyberspace and not at all landing on your Hercules SmartCard...Casting your eye idly around the laundry room for some kind of 1-800-HOWZMYDRIVING type of complaint number...and finding none...you try again...risking all...Hercules SmartCard promises so much and your yearning is so great...Walla, this time it lands but don't get TOO Herculean or Smart because now you have to try to use it to first wash, then dry your clothes. Washing is a piece of cake, after you figure out that the "heavy load" option *will never, ever, ever come* with Hercules SmartCard. But 40 minutes later....there's the dryers to tackle.  And this is where even the smartest, most college-educated, practical-life-experience-credit kind of person is going to be boggled. Pushing the Hercules SmartCard into the slot of the dryer just once, say, in a rough analogy to the old "drop in the quarter in the actual slot" ritual, will NEVER start the machine. Push it in and hold it a second while it says "Welcome to HerculesSmartCard"...well, it's to court bitter disappointment because *in no time at all* it tells you to REMOVE CARD. You suspect it really wants to say REMOVE CARD DUMBASS.  You didn't put in that special tennis-wrist flick to get it to both WELCOME *and* kick in to say...nothing....which is what it does say mystically while it is debiting out, hehehe not 25 cents..but a whole lot more (you suspected that's what the Hercules SmartCard operation was all about in the first place NOT because everybody complained about never having enough quarters...)  Finally, after a pregnant pause...you suspect...you hope...you know it is time to PUSH and the dryer starts...with only 10 minutes...requiring you to start the entire ridiculous passive-aggressive Hercules SmartCard operation all over again...at least 6 more times...never quite moving fast enough past WELCOME to PUSH...encountering REMOVE CARD YOU FLAMING !@#$!@#$ several times...finally it's loaded...except now it is telling you LOW CARD VALUE and it's BACK to what we affectionately call the "Dashboard" to risk loading up another $20...for what used to be that old $8.00 caper...You suspect that the entire Hercules SmartCard production effort from door to door and dawn to dusk involves people from Bangalore to Trenton, NJ ("Trenton Makes, the World Takes")and you suspect that all those people need to get paid for making, distributing, tracking, and tabulating the Hercules SmartCard...and so we have entered a complex web...a more expensive web...a web where Alik and the nice lady at Chase and the Sun and your $8.00 are left WAY behind in some cyberspace tsunami involving thousands of people wedded to Hercules SmartCard and costing ultimately billions...  I know that Hercules SmartCard is winning. I know that Hercules SmartCard is Taking Over. Hercules SmartCard already knows what we had for dinner. Hercules SmartCard knows we didn't tip the pizza man more than $2.  Hercules SmartCard knows how many words are written...who forgot their best friend's birthday...who crossed the street and when and where...what's left in the bank...how many steps there are between here and..here and....wait how does Hercules SmartCard know THAT? Is there to be nothing kept from Hercules SmartCard? Hercules SmartCard is Everywhere and Nowhere. It knows Everything and Nothing. And our laundry is not done...

      I suppose the reason why I am thinking the above is partly because I  a) am returning to university part-time to get my Honours in English  b) write on the side (some prose and poetry) c) am a reader  This then poses the question: when is a novel 'literary' and when is it trash?  Of course, the first answer would be the "it depends on what you're reading". Why must we answer like this? What would be the distinguishing factor(s) between 'literary' (and thus worth notice) and 'trash'?  I suppose part of the reason why I am asking this question aloud is because I am taking a class called "Literature and Criticism" this summer session, and we had a 'discussion' (if you call one-sided lecturing a discussion) about this.   I've always wondered why there is this distinction. As someone who does dabble with pen and paper (yes, still use pen and paper, and not just word processors), I've wondered what qualifies a piece as literary. Is it because it is well-written? If that is a qualifier, what is 'well-written'?    I suppose the other reason why I am pondering aloud is because I have read some stuff recently that has been published but, frankly, isn't up to what I consider 'par' for worth publishing. I am thinking of a novel that was self-published that I somehow managed to buy over this past weekend at my local Coles bookstore.  I thought the premise was good. I got to meet the author who was cordial and easy-going. I didn't realize, at the time, that he was pimping his self-published book. Next thing I knew, I had a book that was signed, etc., and kinda felt obligated to buy. I wandered around the Coles, thinking of a birthday present for my Mom, and sat down in a corner to look over this novel that I had basically purchased.  Big mistake. I started to read it and I questioned giving the book to my Dad. From my own set of standards, there were many obvious comma splices, repetitive sentence structure, and, to my horror, two pages were missing from the book itself. I felt that I should approach the author to 'inform' him that his novel was missing two pages, but then I thought I might be pressured into buying another one (although I'm not normally an easy touch), and I couldn't set myself up for that again. So I bailed with that book and another that I thought my Mom would like.  But it made me question literary vs trash. Most would agree that Harlequin novels could be considered 'trash'. But could Harlequins be considered literary in the 'romance' genre? I admit to reading the odd Harlequin here and there simply for a fast, brainless read. Or is the fact that it's a 'brainless' read a signifier for non-literary. Where would Danielle Steele fit in then? Or am I just sounding like a snob when I say that the only Danielle Steele that I read was like reading a glorified Harlequin?  So now I look at the question of literary vs trash from a writer's perspective. Of course, most writers would not consider their own material as trash. I also look at the dribs and drabs that I have written, and I think I can honestly say that what I have written thus far has 'promise' for something 'literary', not trash. If anyone wants me to post some of my work here, let me know. I'm game for some critiquing. But getting back on track, would a novel be considered 'trash' if it was a la Harlequin; in other words, if the writer was following a set form, cranking out the novel in record time, not doing a lot of research, etc ? Would John Grisham be considered a trash novel?  More to ponder on the idea, I can't help but wonder how the literary vs trash idea is a reflection of our society and perhaps our generation. Do we, as a society, not want to think any more, and thus we opt for novels that fit form, give us a standard diet of what we expect, and we gain nothing from the experience?  Maybe I'm just ideallistic. Wouldn't be the first time someone called me that.  Shiara

      I live in my head a lot, and let me tell you, it's not the greatest place to live.   If my head were a city there would be lots of trains and every house would be on the wrong side of the tracks in one way or another. There would be evil landlords and NO suburbs. I won't allow it. Also my city would have fire fighters but no fires. Lots of floods, though.  The squirrel population in my city would be huge. There would be lots of lawyers who fight over everything but no jail, all the bad guys will be shipped out to another city. My city would also have a small airport because, from time to time, things fly way over my head (har har har).

         Very few people believe in the Giant Turles of Penn Yan, NY because if they didn't see them or they didn't hear about them back then, well, then, they just missed it and they are not willing to suspend disbelief for something as wacky as *that*. But I am here to tell you that the Giant Turtles of Penn Yan, NY *really existed* and not only did I see them, and see them many times, I even saw a dead one that time one of them somehow crawled out of the muddy waters of the creek and climbed up on the dangerous railroad bridge that we were never, ever supposed to climb up on but of course we did and it's a good thing, too, because if we hadn't we wouldn't have seen the Giant Turtle, the Dead Giant Turtle, and being dead, and being out there on the railroad tracks and smushed as a new wheat-back penny like the kind we always put on the tracks to smush, well, if we hadn't SEEN IT DEAD then we couldn't ever prove that it was alive. And it's a damn shame that things like Giant Turtles work that way in life, that you often cannot prove they were ever alive and existed until *after* they are smushed on the railroad tracks, dead as doornails, whatever doornails are, prompting some people like Mr. Monahan to make lots of sarcastic comments like "what's for dinner, turtle soup yuk yuk."    I often try to reason WHY the Giant Turtles of Penn Yan, NY really did exist. I know they existed because I watched bunches of them slither in and out of the muddy depths below Burkett Mill, behind Walkerbilt Mill. This was my operating theory at the time as to Why These Turtles Were So Large That Even the Men of Science Were Amazed! I think they ate the hulls from the buckwheat. Burkett Mill is something like the sole supplier in the United States of buckwheat/kasha, the kind that only Russians and old ladies eat. (Yes, go check that box of buckwheat gathering dust in your cupboard that you were meaning to include in your healthy *cough* diet and you'll see it was milled at Burkett Mills.) I think that tepid, muddy creek water filled with the warm millstream and the byproducts of buckwheat production -- and a rather brisk buckwheat production at that -- when consumed by the ordinary box turtle, or the ordinary, um, bog turtle, let's say, to be open-minded, conspired to make the Giant Turtles of Penn Yan, NY. There are other theories, of course. Maybe somebody had an exotic animals zoo out near Avon before you got to Wahl's hotdogs, not the Wahl's in Pittsford, the other Wahl, the brother, the brother that didn't do so well as the one with the ice cream parlor, and then the exotic animals zoo went belly up and their creditors were after them and they had to hide the exotic animals bought on that wild drunken sex tour of Thailand QUICK and what better place than the murkey waters below Burkett Mill, where nobody but dumb kids playing in a place they definitely weren't supposed to be playing were hanging out would *ever* see the shameful results of your pathetic enterprise.  Just in case they *were* the snapping kind, we didn't go too close, we didn't even poke them, we just watched. The Giant Turtles really, truly did exist because we saw them. Whenever I try to tell the Yates Country Historical Society or the old school teachers and experts of Penn Yan, NY that there were Giant Turtles in the water below the bridge on Main Street, they go all Aunt Em on me and start in with the "Oh, we all dream silly things when we..."  Um...when we what? When we were hit on the head by a house in a cyclone? But we weren't hit on the head by a house in a cyclone. *We saw them because they did exist.* Naturalists say it couldn't possibly be true because Giant Turtles that belong in places like the Galapagos can't survive an upstate New York winter near icy water...I can only offer you the solid tortoise shell of memory: they did exist because we saw them, and even an adult saw a dead one, and maybe he could see the Giant Turtle that we saw for maybe one zany moment because for a time he was walking in the same woods with a future Monster Drunk Driving Tree, the kind of tree that bloomed and blossomed in these small towns across America every spring around graduation time, and ravenously wrapped themselves around and ate alive a few sons like Tommy Monahan so that you could almost think that maybe they never existed, that maybe Tommy never lisped to you, his mouth ragged with missing teeth and excess saliva, 'Let's kill the cat," or that he never said, 'There's a Giant Turtle on the Tracks, a Dead One, You Gotta Come Look!"

           Little Wad of Meat Happy, dancing, talking smack Fills my heart with joy    I remember seeing  Aqua Teen Hunger Force  for the first time.  For a moment I was certain that I was high, then I remembered that I don't do that sort of thing any more.  The more I watch, the more I'm certain that the point of the show is to provide a service for those of us who no longer take drugs but sometimes miss the sensations involved.  This might also be idea behind  Sponge Bob , but I'm certain the execs at Viacom didn't realize that until it had been on the air for some time.  With adult swim it almost had to be the intent.  Much of the time I find that Meatwad and I are on the same wave length.  We both go through life looking for the good in others.  We both smile constantly for no apparent reason, and we're both likely to start dancing at odd times to the music of our own minds.  Both Meatwad and I seek the love and approval of others, and when someone doesn't like us we are apt to work harder for it.    The concept of relating to an animated wad of meat is kind of creepy, but I embrace the eccentricity of it.  ATHF comes on most nights at midnight, and I can't think of a better way to end my day than being artificially blissed out cheering on my favorite meaty counterpart.

      Yup, Shiara checking in on the Teh Collective Bug...  What to talk about... the worst part about a blog is that when you're not sitting down in front of the computer, there are a TON of things to think about, and that you want to record. For example, I could add Corn's rant about Wal-Mart and its steady spread into the wilds of Canada. What about the upcoming Canadian election? But the kicker is that the moment you are in front of the pc, with the blog site handy, the mind goes blank and you go, WTF ?  OK - I know what I'm going to rant about.... what's with the d@mn slogans in election campaigns? In the past provincial election (think running for govenor), we had 'choose change' as the main slogan. Oh boy, did Ontarians ever choose change. We're now saddled with a health tax levy of X dollars (and Canadian ones at that) in order to pay for our health care. I suppose it's money well spent, but considering all the fiscal mis-management that has been going on recently, the electorate is wondering....  Now, with the federal election coming on, we have "choose your Canada" and 'demand better' as election campaigns. Hmmm.... I get to choose the devil I know or the devil I don't know. Do I want to even demand better from my government? It's this cynicism in me that goes, "What's the dif? They're going to do the same thing. Zebra doesn't change its stripes."   I'm sorry, but from my perspective, any prospective government that threatens to use the notwithstanding clause to remove any fundamental right guaranteed in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms against me does NOT get my vote. I don't give a damn that you'll put it up to a free vote in parliament. The fact that you even entertained the idea means that you deserve a hard and swift kick in the bojangles. And not just one, either. What is this, we're going back to a pre-war Germany? Let's play 'Strip Rights from Various Fraction Groups?'  I believe in freedoms guaranteed in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I also believe that the Supreme Court of Canada has the legal right to define what constitutes marriage. If it were left up to parliament, the definition would be changing with the changing of parliament!   So sorry for the rant. The crap that is being spewed to the Canadian electorate gets to me. It's as if we're all stupid. What happened to not ASSUMING anything?  Shiara

      Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, right? Well, that's what "they" say, but who is "they" anyway? And why does  their  opinion matter? Ok, now I'm just going off an a tangent. Anywhoo the other night I was bored and decided to browse some random blogs, many were good and very insightful! I loved reading them. But, of course, as I browsed I did find some views and opinions I found offensive, and even hurtful. Now, I for one try to have respect for others opinions and try to understand them, but often I'm just at a loss. Sometimes it seems to come down to their own ignorance, mean egotisms, and closed mindedness. So to help out some of our clueless fellow bloggers I have put together:    A Basic Guide to Growing a Mind   By Corn        Introduction:   The human brain is probably your most valuable asset. One should take great pride in his/her brain and it's contents. Your brain is a private place for your own private thoughts. Literally, its about the only place one can store their most precious things. Thoughts. But it is not as simple as this. To maintain a healthy properly functioning brain one needs to provide it with proper maintenance such as a plant might need; feeding, pruning, watering, space, sunlight, temperature etc etc. These are essential in keeping your brain happy, healthy, and from thinking stupid thoughts. So, to help you all out I have outlined the following information for your disposal.   Sunlight:  Believe it or not, your mind needs plenty of sun to grow and flourish. A mind kept in darkness will never be enlightened. Take your mind out into the world, view and experience things for yourself and base your opinions and thoughts on personal insights.   Watering and Feeding:  Food for thought! Feed your brain good things. Reading is great for expanding the mind and letting new ideas into that small mind of yours (I know, reading?! Unfortunately Miracle Grow doesn't work here), but be careful what you feed it. Not everything you read is a reliable resource. As a rule of thumb, you can never have to much variety in your minds diet. In fact, the more you indulge the better. No diet pills or carb counting here!   Pruning:  Part of maintaining your mind and keeping it sound is keeping track of what's in there. Often you can't form new views unless you have let go of old ones. So... prune away! You never know a nice new branch may develop, or the same old one.   Space:  A mind needs plenty of space to grow. It's best to keep your developing mind in an open space where it can spread out. If you keep it locked up all the time your mind will experience nothing new. So keep that mind open!   Temperature:  How you store your mind is very important. Your mind is best kept a  varied range of different temperatures depending on its needs at the time. There is always a time for a nice warm thoughts, but don't try to hold back those callous cold ones as well. Balance is recommended in this area.   Pests:  Occasionally your mind may experiences pests. These are best dealt with head on. Going along with keeping one's mind open, there is such thing as "to open minded." Don't let ideas into your head that aren't wanted. Just because its popular doesn't mean its right.  Following these basic rules anyone can and should be able to maintain a strong sound mind. The important thing to remember is that each persons mind is their own plant. Instead of strangling theirs out allow theirs to grow so they may develop and mature.     Corn  P.S. Just to make it clear, I am not talking to anyone on   our   happy little blog, you guys are all great! : )

      I'll be the first person to admit that I'm addicted to TSO.  And those closest to me DO kind of make fun of me for it...the man even often refers to himself as a "computer widower".  It's true, I've gone days without letting the sun hit my skin...and I won't leave the house unless I'm forced to.  When I'm home, there's nothing else I'd rather do than sit at my wonderful new expensive computer for hours!  Corn and I should start a hermit club, I think.  But when I think about it...it's quite obvious that I just plain have an addictive personality.  If it wasn't TSO, it would be something else.  Really, it could be much worse...it COULD be heroin.  Or I could be a sex addict, having all kinds of dangerous disease causing encounters with sleazy strangers.  Or perhaps a gambling addict...but with my crappy luck, I'd be so in debt that I'd have to resort to the sleazy strangers thing anyway. *sigh*   So taking all these things into consideration...I think TSO is actually GOOD for me.  :)  AH punch, you have never failed me.

      I was bored in summer school today and as I tapped my pencil to the tune of Oops I Did It Again, I thought:  I like pencils much more than pens. If you make a mistake with pencils all you have to do is erase, erase, erase and that mistake is gone (unless of course you get a bad eraser which in turn makes a bigger mistake. I don't like those erasers).  Then there are pens with erasers. Those are OK.  Sometimes I worry that humans will use all the trees and then we would have no good paper or conventional pencils. I don't like mechanical pencils much, they are too much like pens for my taste. Also our paper would probably be made out of fabric or other plants. But we'd still have to use pens and mechanical pencils, so people like me wouldn't write as much.  I would also like to take this time to let you know that I did not forget about typing. But at this part of the future robots would have taken over. Or aliens. But computers would be outlawed for people and smarter, but still as funny-looking monkeys. We might use them for a rebellion.  Back on track. We would start running out of plants and fabric and we'd be forced to ration them (how long this takes depends on if it's aliens, robots or both that took over). That means writing would be done in stone or some kind of metal (which is probably really heavy, like stone) or maybe some plastic or futuristic material (most likely given to us by the aliens and/or robots). We wouldn't do very much writing and sooner or later we wouldn't even bother to teach it to the next generation.  We would only speak, so for people that are forgetful, life would be hard and frustrating. Blind people would get around much like they do today with the exceptions of no Braille and Supreme Beings. Deaf people on the other hand would have to learn one of two things: to read minds, or to read lips. If someone is both deaf and blind... well, the aliens and/or robots would probably kill them because they think feelings such as sympathy are a sign of weakness.  That's why I like pencils.

      10 random things about me:  1. I have spent over twenty years in the museum profession--most of it I'm pretty proud of.  I've worked in museums about firefighting, military history, technology and industry, transportation, and general urban history.    2. I have two great kids--them, I am extremely proud of.  They both are quite intelligent, articulate, creative, and funny.     3.  I have co-authored a couple of books about history, and written a number of articles.  I think my best writing however, is the packaging text I write for a toy company that makes historical action figures.  4. I was working for FDNY at the time of 9/11, running the department's museum, which is in Soho, just a short walk from the World Trade Center.  A lot of very good people I knew and worked with did not make it.  I lay most of the blame for what happened at the feet of the current administration.    5. Most of my adult life I have done living history.  At various times, I have been a member of the Union Army in the Civil War, the Detroit militia in the American Revolution, an 1860's baseball team, an 1850s fire company, and the Kaiser's army in WWI.  I have given speeches at political rallies for William Henry Harrison, cleaned castor oil lubricant off the wings of a Fokker triplane, set type and printed handbills on a hand-operated printing press, fired a Maxim machine gun, served on the crew of a hand-pumped fire engine, and cooked cabbage soup on a field stove for 40 men. I have been an 1820's tavern keeper on the old National road, a an 1850s German immigrant who helped on the Underground Railroad, a WWII GI who was in the first wave on D-Day, a 1910's NYC firefighter who responded to the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, And I enjoyed almost every minute of it.  Sometimes I think I have an innate desire to be in other places and other times.  Maybe that's why I enjoy being in the virtual world of Sims Online so much.  On the other hand, I really do enjoy the here and now.  6.  I have a Master's degree in American Urban History.  My master's thesis was on the history of sewers.  When one of the english professors  I had known early on in my undergraduate days heard about this, he commented to me, "Well, I'm glad to see you finally found something on your level."   7.  One of the coolest places I have ever visited was was the village of Chawton in England.  It's the place where Jane Austen lived for much of her life and the house is still there.  There are still cottages in the village with thatched roofs, not because its a recreation of ye olde days, or because it's a tourist trap, but just because the people who own the houses want to have thatched roofs.  There is a village church sits in a little glen on the edge of the community and isn't locked, so you can go in and read their "book of remembrance."  Across the street from the Austen house is a pub that's maybe three hundred years old or so.  They were serving venison sausage for lunch the day I went there.    8.  I live in a 1930's ranch cottage on the wrong side of the tracks in suburban Connecticut with Holiday and the cats.  As she mentioned the cats are in charge of things.  9.  The best vacation I ever went on was to Key West, Florida.  If you ever go to Key West, try to stay at a bed and breakfast called Marrero's.  They have a happy hour with free pina coladas and daiquiris.  I have no idea how these people don't go broke doing this.  The pool area is clothing optional and the plantings around the pool are just beautiful.  Also be sure to take a sunset "booze cruise"--we took one in which we went out on a big catamaran sailboat.  They gave us all the champagne we could drink while we watched the sunset.  While we were out, some Irish guys hit on Holi.  She zinged them with some comment about having dated irish guys before and how inadequately endowed they all seemed to be.    10.  I enjoy theatre, movies and certain operas (Mozart: yowzaa!  Wagner: ZZZZZZZZZZ).  At the same time, I enjoy being in front of an audience: I did a bit of acting in high school and college, and have learned to apply aspects of theatre in the museum biz.  I'm a pretty good storyteller too.

       I wrote this for the About Me section in my profile.  I've seen other bloggers do "101 things about me" posts, but IMO that's just pretentious.  Enjoy   1. I have a degree in Voice, along with a minor in music theory.  The theory minor is considered geeky even by other musicians.  I actually had to write a fugue and a sonata to earn it.  Not many singers can brag about having written a sonata, even a really bad one.  2. When flying on an airplane I almost always hit the airport bar right before boarding.  3. I was born in Kentucky and raised in Ohio.  Most of my family lives in the South still, and have outrageous accents.  I have a part time southern accent that comes out at unexpected moments or after any amount of time spent with my family.  4. My mother is the craziest woman in the entire human race.  I know that you'll read this and think: "No she can't be because *my* mother is the craziest woman there is."  You're wrong though.  My mother's crazy would wipe the floor with yours.  5. I am legally blind in my left eye.  6. One of my career goals is to do voiceovers for cartoons.  To my great surprise I'm close to actually achieving it.    7. Coffee is my drug of choice, and I consume it in large quantities.   I'm on a first name basis with the employees of four coffee places near where I work.   At my favorite coffee place they have both my time of arrival and my order memorized.  I often arrive there to find that my drink has just finished being made.  My current favorite espresso drink is a medium cappuccino with skim milk.  8. In the last year I've lost 60 pounds.   My ultimate goal is to lose 100.  9. Over the course of my life I've had several unique jobs.  I've been an orphan both in a TV commercial and a dinner theater production of Annie.  I've worked for several museums and actually got paid to wear a hoop skirt in public.  I sang show tunes in a gay bar on Fire Island.  Last year I did watch repair, despite being blind and not able to see the tiny watch parts.  Currently I get paid to take pictures of people, which is most ironic as I know nothing about photography.  Hopefully my next job will be as the voice of a cartoon character.  I'd also settle for being a media mogul.  10. I live with my partner Aldo (who also posts to this blog) and two male tabby cats named Elliot and Chester.  Elliot is more Aldo's cat, and Chester is my baby.  He adopted us when he was a kitten, literally grabbing my coat with his tiny paw from his cage and refusing to let go.  The volunteer got him out and he jumped right up onto my shoulder.  Chester and I have been best buds ever since.  The cats completely rule the roost at our home, we've long since stopped trying to pretend otherwise.

      I too have another blog, but it's more in the LiveJournal capacity.  Not horribly g-rated, but whatever.   urlLink Read at your own risk.   I haven't been writing in it much anyway, mainly because there are so many people who have me on their friends lists that I'd rather not think about anymore.  But I've got a couple gems, including the drunken rant I put up when I'd been scorned by yet another Nifty Net Guy.  That's the not-so-nice side of The Chres.  :)  I need photo hosting.  Any suggestions?  Pete and I went for a bike ride today.  We borrowed some bikes that his dad kept at the beach house and have been trying to get out more often so that we don't melt into piles of overfed, oversmoked, and underexercised mush.  The trails around here are absolutely gorgeous...I basically live in a rich suburb outside of Houston, and so I'm constantly glared at by people in spotless beige Lexi (yes, that's the appropriate pluralization of Lexus) as I drive to work in my 1996 Nissan Maxima with the Darwin fish on the back.  But the scenery is well-kept, and the bike trails are paved, which is the only suggestion of civilization among canopies of trees, wildflowers, and scampering bunnies far from the hustle of Highway 59.  I just felt like a kid again, screaming as I navigated through puddles left over from the recent rains and chasing squirrels up trees.  Now I know what it must feel like to be a dog...minus the licking the crotch thing.  Anyway.  It's late.  Must sleep.  I'm still trying to get the images out of my head from TNT's version of Salem's Lot...I don't do well with gory visuals.  They stick with me for some reason...I'm sure I'll dream about vampires tonight.  Maybe I'll wake up at 2, watch a couple episodes of Buffy, and sleep fitfully as I imagine making out with Spike and kicking some anonymous drone's undead patuckus.  Or maybe I'll dream about something even more twisted, like last night.  Regardless...good night, all.

          "Sir, Please put your bananas on the scale!" An innocent enough phrase in it's own right. But it can be quite aggravating when said by the 17 year old checker named Kari (of course the dot on the "i" has a little heart sticker over it) at the local Wal-Mart. Especially if its the one who once accused you of shoplifting a $.25 pack of gum. The fact of the matter is Kari is just a small little scale on the evil monster that is the Wal-Mart corporation.  Wal-Mart is just plain evil. Not easily convinced? Get comfy and keep reading!  Browsing Wal-Marts website I found some interesting material. Here is the first of Wal-Marts "Three Basic Beliefs;"     Respect the Individual  " 'Our people make the difference' is not a meaningless slogan - it's a reality at Wal-Mart. We are a group of dedicated, hardworking, ordinary people who have teamed together to accomplish extraordinary things. We have very different backgrounds, different colors and different beliefs, but we do believe that  every individual deserves to be treated with respect and dignity ."   Don Soderquist,  Senior Vice Chairman of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Retired)            Well... being tackled and frisked in the entrance of the local Wal-Mart store sure is treating this individual with dignity and respect. And as far as making a difference, well my town now has a striking architectural land mark, the big aluminum sided Super Wal-Mart right off I-25, like a shining beacon welcoming you to our fair town. It's warm and comforting sight for road weary eyes no doubt. And it only attracts some of the most colorful people around including but not limited to; homeless people, prostitutes (yes, they truly have everything at Wal-Mart don't they?), sassy teens, punk kids, soccer moms, creepy old hermits like myself, midgets, carnies, and other assorted magical creatures. So, in a way, they have created a gathering place for all us suburbanite freaks, and they should be applauded for that in the least.  I just hate Wal-Mart.  Back to the check out aisle with our friend Kari. What angers me about this so much? Well, besides the fact she's obviously a little snobby brat and has an annoying high pitched voice and is probably popping pills to be so cheerful. Wal-Mart just brings out the worst in people. Maybe it's the bad florescent lighting, the stark warehouse interior, the soft elevator music, or maybe we are all just horrible people to begin with. On a trip to Wal-Mart one can always expect to see two soccer moms dueling it out over the last box of Captain Crunch, each fighting wildly for the coveted prize, mostly so their little Karis' can grow strong bodies and minds and live a fruitful life; Or because they will never hear the end of it if they don't get the box with the free Pokemon plush toy in it.   Of course one could catch me roaming the aisles of Wal-Mart on a regular basis, but where else is one to shop? My town has never had, and never will have a "local grocer" or a "mom & pop" set up, because they can't compete with Wal-Marts "low, low prices," they are just so hard to pass up. All I can say is, Wal-Mart has hit rock-bottom, and I’m not talking about their prices.   C. Vanderbilt   P.S. Despite it's evilness, I would kill to be a Wal-Mart greeter!

      Hello, I'm here.  It took me awhile though.  AOL seems to think that Corny and Val are spammers so the invites never came through.  Well, I say Bah to that!  I'd never actually looked at my spam folder before and it turns out that alot of my legitimate E-mail wasn't getting through.  Thanks to The Collective Bug I now know that it's a good idea to check that once in awhile.  Not much else to say, so here's a fun picture that I took today on my cell phone.

      Expect nothing short of amazing and insightful remarks, discoveries, and...oh, hell, who am I kidding?  Screw it, I'll just ramble.    I've been looking into my psyche to try to figure out why I keep a journal.  I've been writing in journals since I was about 11 or 12 (I could go back and do the math from the dates, but why bother?), and I have about six of them now, one of which is unfortunately lost forever.  *sniffles*  It's not a diary...I don't write down what I did that day or what I ate for breakfast.  (Though I probably should...my thighs might be significantly smaller.)  I sit and write pages and pages of what I think about things that may or may not have anything whatsoever to do with me.   Am I insane?  Probably.  It is, however, interesting to be able to go back and see all the things I used to be.  There's been a lifelong search for the Meaning of Life, God, and various Important Things that most people already have their answers to.  And then I see patterns.  I can't ever seem to decide wholly on any of various topics...with religion, there is a possibility that you might be wrong, and I absolutely hate being wrong.  With relationships, there's the chance that it might not work out or that people (being as they are) will change and become someone different, hence my deep-seated fear of commitment.  Maybe that's why I like books so much...there's a sense of permanence about the fact that the words aren't going to GO anywhere.  Sure, there are revisions and translations, but once words are on paper, the only way to get them off is to somehow destroy the paper.  It's said, it's done, you can't take it back.  Scary, yes, but comforting in a way.    People come and go, trends change, religions fall in and out of fashion.  But books will be books, whether you like them or not.   You've gotta admire that.    --C*

      I was taking my picture today (because I'm obsessed with my purple-ish hair) and I thought,  I should get my picture taken professionally!  And then I remembered that I don't like professionals. They are pushy and have a lot of built up anger because they lie to the ones they love for personal gain.

        You herd me, Urban Canadian Gypsies! Outside town there is a small group for Canadian natives who hail from Montreal. I have dubbed them The Urban Canadian Gypsies. Apparently, for reasons unknown, these individuals have chosen to give up on conventional life and live a nomadic style. This band of Urban Canadian Gypsies have set up camp right on the edge of our beloved suburban paradise near the county dump. Many residents consider them a nuisance that threaten our very existence, I on the other hand have grown quite fond of these neighbors from the north. Their mindless wandering and over use of the catch phrase, "eh!" simply charms the pants off me! But... that's another story in itself!     Anywhoo, why do I mention these Urban Canadian Gypsies? Well, I ask myself the same question. Over time I have become secretly obsessed with these people and their developing culture. I often find myself in absolute awe of the things these people produce; They literally make the most useful things. Who would have ever thought that you could make a fully functional can opener out of a rusty coat hanger and some bits of string. Well, all I can say is I need a Tetanus shot at least once a week, but the extra bit of flavor it adds to an already excellent can of creamed corn is just what makes it worthwhile.   These people are highly skilled in the arts of making junk into useful junk. For example they have their pop cycle stick storage bins, made of what else but pop cycle sticks. What do they need to store them for? Well, that's a silly question... it's so they have a place to store them until they  have enough for a new bin! Duh, why didn't we think of that?      Of course, these guests in our community do have their windfalls, but then again nobody's perfect! They seldom, if ever actually harm anyone on their raids. Yes, raids. Can you really expect them to just linger around and do nothing? Well, all they do is hop in their veneer-sided older-then-you station wagons blasting Zamfir playing the Canadian anthem on his magic pan flute on the old 8-Tracks and ride past the "security" gates which can be opened by anyone with enough precision to press a little red button as they glide on by. They then proceed to raid and pillage our identical-humble-cookie-cutter-beige-mass-produced-mini-mansions while brandishing shiny objects and making spooky noises. Fortunately, these Urban Canadian Gypsies are illiterates, meaning they can't keep track of addresses, hence the fact they have raided the same three houses over and over again for the past six months. Then again, they may be the smart ones, as the owners of said houses still have not picked up on the trend. But then again they are the ones who stuck the waffle iron in a--  Pffft, I can tell you are not even listening... Just never mind... I had a point, really I did!  C. Vanderbilt

      I have come to the time in my life where I feel I need to share more. And we are not just talking about splitting a grape fruit for breakfast. When it comes down to it, I'm about as shallow as a puddle in the Wal*Mart parking lot. Oh sure those pot holes can be deep, but nobody cares to venture into them. That's why I am joining Teh Collective bug! Expect to find boring ramblings, crack-pot theories, and just anything stupid and/or offensive here to be signed with good old C. Vanderbilt.   As Val said when she thought I wasn't looking, "Insight into insanity."   C. Vanderbilt

      Ok, they're gone.  Yup, that's right, I haven't had the nails a week before I removed them.  After telling my parents that I went for a nail job, to which they went, "You did  what ?", I waited an entire week before removing them from my fingernails. My Mom looked at them, told me which ones looked really fake, and then watched in mock horror as I began the arduous process of picking them off one by one. Suffice to say, I would try to casually 'pop' them off, and she'd be wincing watching me.  Now my own nails are really rough. I have to 'buff' my nails. How ironic.

      Is what I keep repeating over and over in a panicky voice to my boyfriend last Saturday night as I combed my hair.&nbsp; And he kept replying with "no you're not, stop this..." But his words fell on deaf ears as I imagined myself in a toupé or sporting a horrendous comb-over à la Donald Trump. Of course this made no sense as I'm female and I would most likely end up wearing a wig. But like Is aid, i was panicking and not thinking clearly.   Well it turns I'm not balding after all. The average human sheds anywhere from 50 to 150 hairs a day and I think I'm at the low end of that. But I don't have all that much to shed,&nbsp;I have baby-fine hair...its smooth and soft but ultra fine and it's a complete bummer. I don't think anyone realizes how much a pain in the butt fine hair is , especially if you're female and like to have longish hair. My pony tail is a joke. It's a tiny little rat tail. I really envy people who have delicious thick hair follicles and an abundance of hair.  I told Corn about my hair woes but it turns out he's one of these people with a luxurious nest of unruly locks on the top of his head. No fair. So for now I will continue to fluff and style my hair daily to keep up appearances until I'm married, at which point I intend on gaining at least 50 pounds and losing all my hair immediately. And possibly acquirring a bad case of acne. And maybe the clap.&nbsp;

      So, to offset a phone call on Thursday night, I decide on Friday morning to have my nails done.   I'm one of those weirdos that is so not into the beauty scene. I'm lucky to highlight my hair once a year (even then, it's a bright fushia or some silly colour like that) and if I'm wearing 'face paint', it means one of two things: I feel really freakin' awesome, or I had time in the morning. So for me to go and do my nails meant that I needed something 'girly' done to me, to pamper me, as it were.   So I go to the place in the town I live and wait. And wait. Finally, the lady looks at me and asks what I want done. Gel Nails, I say. Ok, she says, we do that for you. She quotes the price and begins to get me set up.   After a quick run to the bank (I'd forgotten cash, thinking that I could pay by debit and went to the ONE store that does not USE debit!), I have my nails started.   Feeling mighty pleased with myself, after about an hour, I head home fake nails and all. And no, they're not red in colour - they're a light pink, natural-like. Just the way I wanted them.   So, the first problem occurs when I get in the door. I can't 'feel' my keys. These nails, being fake, and the whole process thereof, do not allow me any sensation except on the pads of my fingers. I can't pick up coins like I used to. And I certainly can't type like I used to, either! (I keep typing sued instead of used ... as an example). I can't get a good 'scritch' going. I can't open up a Coke can (you'll break a nail!), and there's crap that keeps coming underneath these things. It's the most ugly and gross thing I've ever seen. I can't bite my nails, and they feel harder than rocks.  Makes a great clicking sound when I'm typing, but other than that, these damn things are useless.   Next time I go for someting 'girly', I'm doing something with my hair.

      Today I went to the dentist. I  hate  the dentist with a passion. They are always so mean to me!         Anyway it was an average visit. I sat in the chair clutching the arms with a white knuckle grip. They poked and prodded with their sharp tools, asking me questions I can't possibly answer with their hand down my throat. And of course spearing my gums with their hooks and daggers offering, "let me know if something hurts, and I will try to be more gentle!" This followed by an over animated and equally hoaky wink. Of course this is just one of their games. If you admit it hurts they add a little "*" to your chart to warn everyone you are a baby, and giggle about you as they eat their lunches.     Of course they have to find something to criticize you on. If you are like me, no cavities, minimal plaque, and nice pretty gums they have little to complain about. Usually they throw out the old "brush more often, floss more frequently, and quit drinking soda" diagnosis they have been giving me for years. Apparently if I don't do this my teeth will rot right out of my head. I have been hearing this since I was 15. And of course they try and sell you an electric tooth brush and say that will fix all my problems, I wonder if It might even fix that rash...       So, the only logical explanation for them pushing me to brush and floss more, and give up soda for that matter, is a conspiracy. We all know dentists are up to something. Why do you think they wear those masks? It's to hide the fact they are beside themselves with silent giggles and smiles that they are hoodwinking us all into buying more toothpaste and floss. This as they pat the check in their pocket from Crest that they receive to trick us into buying their nasty toothpaste and dental accessories. Then, what about the soda? Why do they want us to give up soda? Our sweet little addiction? What did it do to them? Well that's simple, they are jealous. They obviously all had freakish parents who made them eat pop cycles with a fork and knife and never drink soda. Hence why they are dentists, they take their frustrated childhood experiences and drive the public to fear the love they never dared have, good old soda pop.  Corn

      As I was sitting on my couch watching Ricki Lake and eating 3 day old Mac-n-Cheese it hit me.     I am white trash!     How could I have missed this? Maybe I have just been paddling down that river in Egypt again. Sure it may be easy to over look the old truck on blocks (three more payments and its all mine baby!), the dead squirrels hanging from my porch, and old bathtub over flowing with empty beer cans outside my house.    I guess one of the signs is when you find yourself pausing as you pass through the paper plate aisle in  urlLink  Wal-Mart  and you find yourself seriously considering never dealing with dishes again. Who cares if I'm wastin' trees, what have they ever done for me?! Perhaps next time I'm there I'll just get it over with and buy some red elastic sweat pants and some knee socks to tuck them into. Of course complete the ensemble with sandals over those socks and an attitude cliche t-shirt. Who am I kidding, I will just pick up a box of White-Trash body detergent and scrub vigorously in hopes of curing this infliction.     How did I end up as white trash? Good question! I ‘spose it has something to do with where I was born, and the fact I’m a hick. Lets consult this diagram:     As we all know, I am a hick living in the South West, Colorado to be exact. So I fit in the "uncultured and retarded" area of the diagram. I think That just about sums it up.   I guess I can be content with being white trash, I will console myself with the fact I am now a real emperor by the standards of  urlLink NationStates . Well, I guess anyone with an internet connection can be, but that's besides the point.  urlLink  The Holy Empire of Corneli  will crush you all.   The Delusional Emperor of Corneli

      I spend a good&nbsp;deal of my time in the Nifty Sector of town, and today was no exception; first at the art store&nbsp;buying a replacement brush for the one that the little sister used for nail polishing, and then flipping through the bookshop for a while after that ( The Idiot Girls' Action-Adventure Club  by Laurie Notaro).&nbsp; The arrival of 3:00, as usual,&nbsp;took me to the coffee shop, wherein waited the usual group of four - two male and two not, but all more or less my age.  &nbsp;  We exchanged&nbsp;greetings - and devised a scheme. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  A three-minute bus ride later, my mother's boyfriend Brian -&nbsp;enjoying&nbsp;a beer-cigarette entree - heard the five of us rush into the house,&nbsp;amongst excited whispers of "Hurry up" and "It's almost on".&nbsp; He heard us all plop onto couches and recliners and piano benches and the sound of his baseball game being turned off.&nbsp;  Click .&nbsp;&nbsp;He then heard the distinct noise of the five of us staring at a blank television screen. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Brian, suddenly feeling curious, scratched at himself as he entered the living room and looked at us.&nbsp;&nbsp;My friends and I&nbsp;were leaning in towards the television, staring fixedly and beginning to drool.&nbsp; He tried to complete a thought, but was interrupted by the realization that he had no brain.&nbsp; Again he attempted to tackle a strip of gray matter with similar results, creating a nicely "Uhhr?" look on his face.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Brian then decided it'd just be easier to speak.&nbsp; He had begun to say "Wha-" when the five of us broke into a huge fit of laughter, pointing at the television and sputtering "Oh my god!" for emphasis.&nbsp; We then continued to stare and drool. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Brian Uhhr-ed a little longer.&nbsp;  Ooh, I know , said the little talking&nbsp;buffalo wing in his head, as his eyes lit up.&nbsp;  They're really watching something, but there's no sound.&nbsp; The only thing wrong here is that I can't see the picture. &nbsp; He walked&nbsp;a few steps and looked past his man-breasts to the television screen and, as should be expected,&nbsp;saw nothing. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "Uh, sir?" said Male #1, on the recliner, with a note of politeness.&nbsp; "Could you get out of the way?&nbsp; We can't see."&nbsp;&nbsp; Male #2, Females #'s 1 and 2, and I all&nbsp;looked up&nbsp;at him with varying looks of frustration and pleading.&nbsp; He&nbsp;gave a blank stare&nbsp;in acknowledgement&nbsp;and slowly&nbsp;backed out of the way. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Brian spent between approximately&nbsp;3:20 and 3:35 standing on the opposite end&nbsp;of the television&nbsp;and furrowing his eyebrows closer and closer together.&nbsp; The moment he had slowly walked out and closed the front door, Uhhr-ing at us through the process, I knew that we had to devise schemes more often.

      It's the freakin' pharmacist's fault.  &nbsp;  I put in my prescription to be refilled at the happy drug dispensary counter at the supermarket across the parking lot from the museum.&nbsp; Judging from the vibes given off by the people who work there, it is in fact, a suburb of purgatory.&nbsp; Today, however, there was a new pharmacist generously spewing better living through chemistry among the less affluent of greater Waterbury (we love our current mayor, mostly because he hasn't been indicted for anything yet).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  They kind of like me at the Outer Regions of Punishment and Remorse Supermarket Pharmacy, because I always opt&nbsp;to leave my prescription, saying, "It's OK, I don't need it right away, ....I get off at 5:00, so I'll pick it up then, if that's all right with you folks."  &nbsp;  This, evidently is very much all right with the folks at the Purgatory drugstore, because when I say this, they fawn like headwaiters who smell a big tip, heaping blessings on the heads of my children, both born and as yet unborn, and express the sincere wish that my camels may all be fertile, and never spit in the gazpacho (which unless I am very much mistaken, was precisely what had happened to the soup they gave me at Joe's American Grill in Fairfield the other night).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  As a matter of fact, the druggist's assistant who I spoke with today seemed so relieved that I wasn't going to want the prescription filled right now and I MEAN RIGHT NOW ASSHOLE BECAUSE IF I DON"T GET MY MEDS IMMEDIATELY,&nbsp;I WILL GO AND PEE IN THE&nbsp;SEASONAL NOVELTIES AND KITCHEN GADGETS AISLE, that I thought, "hey if I play my cards right, I might--just might--get a happy pharmacist's assistant hand job along with my anti-diabetes crap when I come back at 5:00."&nbsp;  &nbsp; And...oh yes....I should specify that I have to get "non-generic-we-have-to-cover-the-costs-of-sending-Eli-Lilly's-great-granddaughters-to-Harvard-and-making-immense-political-contributions-and-taking-care-of-the-nice-plants-at our-immense-brutalistic-style-corporate-headquarters-building-in-East-Dogfart,Indiana-so-we-only-sell-this-over-priced-brand-name-version-of-our-crappy-drugs-that-will-keep-your-miserable-diabetic-ass-from-going-numb-and-falling-off-while-you-cross-the-street" medication, for which of course,&nbsp; my charming and sympathetic Insurance Company&nbsp;will pay a smaller share of the costs.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Bcause it is not generic.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because, as I just explained (if you were listening at all), the Jolly Purveyors of Drugs from East Dogfart only make this particular chemical concoction with a delightful and appealing Brand Name.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Why? Because the other versions of anti-diabetes drugs that are made in generic versions by everybody including Bob's Storm Door Company and Phamacuetical Manufacturing Establishment in West Dogfart, Indiana, don't seem to do jack shit for me and my friendly little malady.&nbsp; And they want you to know that because it has a clever moniker, it no doubt works better than "glorpiostinkingmetapreheneticyoucanbiteme-o-zine."&nbsp; BUT REMEMBER, YOUR AVERAGE GODDAM EVER-SO-HELPFUL INSURANCE COMPANY (when they are not busy strangling cute small furry mammals) WILL ONLY PAY A SMALLER PORTION OF THE COST OF THE SHIT THAT ACTUALLY WORKS.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Ah, crap.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Where was I?  &nbsp;  oh yeah, well anyway, I drag my sorry diabetic ass back in there after work, and lo and behold, even though I didn't get the&nbsp;no-extra-cost-happy ending from the pharmacist's assistant (I think shifts had changed), the lovely chief drug&nbsp;dispenser says, "oh by the way, they now have a generic version of that crap you are taking.&nbsp; You only owe us 10 bucks."&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  And I say, "holyrerfrieddogturdsonwhitetoast, lovely pharmacist person, you did that without me even asking?"&nbsp; And she had, indeed.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I was left with 20 extra bucks burning a hole in my pocket.  &nbsp;  Scene change: Moe's House of Underpriced Imbibery in Fairfield.&nbsp; And at center stage, we see an excessively&nbsp;large bottle of Chianti with an incredibly small price tag.  &nbsp;  to be continued....  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  1

      I told Corn I would write about this, and so I shall. See? I didn't even need the prodding.  Last night in my wanderings in SimArts, I joined Corn at James' place, where my sim decided to be wacky in James' many canals (many many canals). Fortunately for me, my sim can swim, albeit with no direction whatsoever, and I was able to wander around.   Did I mention James has a really cool layout? Almost made me want to give up the library and move in. Speaking of moving, here's where today's thought du jour comes into place....  That was when this character drops in on the lot. Immediately he goes, "Can I be a roommie?" and then presses the issue.   What's the deal here, people? This is one thing I have never understood about TSO and the whole 'roommate' idea. When I first started playing over a year ago (was it that short a time ago?), I had IM's out the wazoo from people going, "Looking for a home?" "Wanna be my roommie" when I was a homeless sim. Some would be ostentatious to the point of inviting me blindly without even really talking with me to know if I suited. When I played my sim in FF, full of newbie dust, I became a roommie without being 100% comfortable at the house. Within a week and after visiting other houses, I found one that suited me so much more, and I moved there. When I started my sim in AV, I didn't become anyone's roommie, preferring to wander to find where I fit. I built the Library in one community, and after a lot of thinking, I moved to SimArts. But I knew I wanted to be in SimArts because of the people in the community. I found people of like mind who understood where I was coming from, and I haven't regretted moving. In fact, you will typically find me with other SimArts neighbours.   Enough regression. Back to the point at hand.  Is this kind of blind "hey, I wanna move in with you" an indicator of how society is today? Does no-one want to get a feel of a place, look around, see if the house (and people living near/in it) suits them before moving in? I'm not only talking about TSO. People seem to be blindly looking for places to live without weighing whether it would be worthwhile to do so. Housing in Canada is at an insane rate. The semi-detached house that my stbx and I bought a mere 3 years ago recently sold for 40k more than what we bought it for. This is a semi, people! It's not even a detached! I went looking at www.mls.ca just to see what the going rate was (I humoured a thought last night), and I'll be damned if the house didn't sell at the going rate.  I guess where I'm going with this rant is that people aren't really looking at what their suitability is for places or people. They're rushing blindly in, not stopping to think about how well they interact with other people. It reminds me of the article in the Globe and Mail (newspaper) that my Mom told me about the other night. Apparently it's 'en vogue' to have a 2 year relationship. IE - meet someone, get married and at about the 2 year mark, say, "See ya". I find it more apparent given my own situation. Because we're in such a fast-paced society, we only have 'time' for a 2 year relationship before we embark on the next 2 year relationship and so on. What the? All of these gadgets that were supposed to allow us to have 'more time' have reduced us to being glued to a clock where, when the allotted time is up, too bad, so sad, thanks for the fish?  Call me old-fashioned, but when you commit yourself to something, it's a committment, not something that after a period of time you trash. You see it to the end, not when fancy and whimsiness beckon you to change your mind.   Unless, of course, one party ends it for you. But then, you could say that they broke their committment to you.

      So this afternoon I finished  "Angels and Demons"  by Dan Brown. First off I will admit it was a good read. It lived up to the authors style and hype of having a twisting plot and a surprising end yada yada yada. BUT... He blew it...   "Vittoria slipped off her robe. 'You've never been to bed with a yoga master have you?'"     That's the last line of his book. Ok I guess he could do worse. With his writing genius I just expected something a little better then that. Maybe a final exciting twist that left a burning question (besides what Robert and Vittoria had for breakfast the next morning). Or perhaps a profound message, as the book did touch a lot on the meaning of science and religion and how they are interconnected. And there is always of course the option to somehow leave an opening for a sequel, perhaps he is planning to go into erotic fiction?  Well, maybe its just me but I thought it was trashy. Although the book did have a dash of a love story in it, it seemed very out of place. It was about as classy as a Hooters on 5th Avenue. Then again, there was a brief part about aliens and gypsies harvesting testicles, so maybe he's running with "variety is the spice of life" idea.     "Definitely not  urlLink gypsies  , he decided in his semiconscious delirium.  Aliens perhaps?  Yes, he had herd about things like this. Fortunately these beings would not harm him. All they wanted were his---"   You get the picture...     Corn

      Yes, I know it's hard to believe...but I actually did NOT have to twist Neruda's arm to drink RL punch at the gathering in Waterbury, CT.  Believe you me, I was WATCHING him...to see if he was just trying to make it LOOK like he was drinking punch.  He did drink slowly, but I'll be damned if I didn't watch him go up for refills WAY more frequently than I expected.  I only had to refill his glass for him ONCE, and some well placed comments here and there seemed to do the trick just fine and dandy. ;)    I realized that the punch was taking effect when Neruda sat right up next to he BIG screen...maybe things were getting a little blurry?  *giggle*  Anyway, Neruda's admission of the effects of alcohol manifested in his comment, "Is my face all red? I'm feeling flushed."  That's when we grabbed the cameras to document this momentous occasion.  He actually posed for this picture willingly. :)    -or view  urlLink  Full Size   And here's a picture of the punch...it is ALL things!

      Well I have taken to browsing other blogs for fun, there are some really neat ones out there! I wanted to share this one called "No Milk" its very funny and witty but insightful.     urlLink  No Milk Please   This man could be my triplet... better yet considering he is ALSO a twin, I guess that would make him my quadruplet? No Milk, his blog title is because he hates dairy. As do I! I only enjoy a little milk with my Honey Nut Cheerios. He also shares my irrational fear of flying. I had a lot of fun reading it, good for a laugh or two!  Also he has a little commic strip I found very clever as well:   urlLink  Deep South   ENJOY!  Corn

      Well, we all read my overly dramatic "Computer Heaven" post about my computer dying. So I reformat the stupid thing and it works much better. Until recently. I have now entered Pop-Up Hell. What horrible computer sin did I commit to deserve this? Yes, I am a horrible person. Brace yourselves... I visited a website where I could download free fonts...  Well, before you judge you must understand I can't live without the font Minstral AV. It's one of my few human weaknesses I'm allowed. It's not something I’m proud of. At first I was just using it casually, maybe with a few friends, or when I was feeling down, needed to make something look semi-handwritten, but obviously typed. I was stupid to start. I didn't even find my fix of Minstral AV, I had to bum some off an anonymous friend, we will call her C. Prophet, no that's to obvious, we will call her Curbside P. Well, I guess I shouldn't say friend, a real friend wouldn't have given it to me...  Anywhoo, I'm now in a loosing war against Pop-Ups. A war many have fought, few have won. I have tried increasing the security options on my browser, Google pop-up blocker, disabling messenger service (most of these thanks to suggestions by Brandon), running Llavasoft endlessly. First time I ran it I got 127 items, second twenty-something. This morning 94 Items and a desk top full of Pop-Ups. 24 Pop-Ups. All identical, for Low Cost Prescription drugs by order of the internet. All I have to say is:  No thanks, I don't need low cost prescription drugs, but thank you for asking!

      I recently moved into a nice, roomy, airy apartment. I painted it Martha Stewart colors, I cleaned it within an inch of its life and moved all my pretty stuff into it. I'm really into personal spaces and a largish, empty-ish apartment is like a blank canvas for me. After about 3 days it was decorated (including the balcony)and comfy and I was feeeling very pleased and snug in my new digs.   Then some old guy died across the street in the other building. Not only was this a very sad event but quite gruesome as no one found him until 6 days later. The smell in that building was overwhelming apparently. After the coroner left, the industrial cleaners came in with masks and shovels... yes... shovels.   My little utopia was now tainted for me. Despite the flowers and the trees and greenspace around my neighborhood, I couldn't stop thinking about the rotting dead guy who had been in the other building for a week. Then I started to think about all the possible scenarios that could have happened in my own appartment. I had visions of a dead guy hanging from a rope from the ceiling, an old lady decomposing in a half filled bath tub... My imagination was running amuck. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat... I was a mess. And so were the people who lived in his building from what I heard. I wanted to move out and live in the park.  Then a few days later I got over it. I met people in the park talking about what had happened in the adjacent building. "So did you know the guy who died?" - "No but I hear he was pretty fit for a 68 year old... went biking everyday... slipped on the bathroom tiles and hit his head and that was it. So where did you get those shoes?" Funny how other people seemed to be getting over it too. The tenants were back sitting on their balconies, or outside yelling at their kids and walking their dogs. What was once horrific gradually became old news in just over the course of the week. I've stopped thinking about what could have happened in my place because if I didn't, I would end up homeless. People spend alot of time in their little homes and apartments and it just makes sense that they'll end up dying in them too unless they end up in a hospital. It's still gross but just part of life I guess.

      For many years I have been practicing the ancient art of Bonsai. Although many people *think* they have a bonsai tree those little balls of foliage glued into a pan of rocks you buy at Walgreens is NOT a bonsai tree; or at least not one worth owning. Many people, including myself have little patience to train a twig in a pot into a masterpiece. A real bonsai tree takes years of dedicated work to create, many hours are spent carefully trimming and shaping branch structures to give the appearance of an ancient tree miniaturized in a pot.     So, for people like myself who want the beauty of a completed masterpiece but don't have 20 years and/or the artistic talent and vision to attempt such a thing as picture above, how can we achieve our inner Zen? Well without further ado, may I present:    BONSAI POTATO! ZEN WITHOUT THE WAIT!      This is a cute idea I saw presented on a Bonsai hobby forum I visit regularly. Although I still will continue the tedious task of attempting to grow real bonsai trees, this is a fun little thing I have tried, and with surprisingly nice results!        Although you may buy a "kit" for this hobby at  urlLink  www.bonsaipotato.com - Waste your money!  It is really as simple as putting a grocery store potato in a dark, dry place for several weeks. You start to get sprouts and within a month or two you have a fabulous Bonsai Potato! Put it in a bowl, a little aquarium gavel, and presto! You have an interesting knick-knack for onto of the TV.  Nothing  screams great taste then a budding half rotten piece of produce!  Corn

      Since my first day at Second Life, I've been talking to this guy Jeroen.  He's Dutch, actually, but his English is incredible; and for ME to say that about someone, you know it's gotta be good.    In any case, we talk a lot.  Good talks, not just "how was your day" talks.  He said he'd been wanting to write me a letter, and he finally sent it to me...  So here it is.  --------------------------------------------------------------------       This could have been about fences and third parties  --------------------------------------------------------------------  First, we have to go back in time for about a week.   Chrestomanci's gruesome act, to put it mildly, of suddenly leaving Jeroen all by himself in a hot tub in the heat of the night, has yet to be performed, and everything is still looking shiny and bright.   Furthermore, we change locations. Right before us we see Jeroen Rock, an impressive natural phenomenon not far from the Second Life newbie arena.   It's dawn. Or dusk. That's actually hard to tell. In all directions brown colours are expanding.   The moon turned yellow again, and judging by it's reflection water is near, though all that's displayed is a giant field of mud.   Apparently it's time for another CPU-upgrade. Jeroen Rock can't be meant to look like this. Not unless we're confronted with a masterful, cynical work of symbolism.   Chrestomanci, wearing her familiar blue jeans and green shirt, is sitting somewhere on the rock, and explains why she never burned her diaries, manifesting herself as a slightly self-satisfied humanist along the way.   Jeroen is walking up and down the rock to make the impression he's busy.   If he could be a humanist, he'd underestimate the value of money too.   But his eyes are open.   Oh yeah, Jeroen.  Several minutes later the already not too pleasant silences have turned into pain.   Even Chrestomanci has stopped talking, for some mysterious reason.   Speak! Jeroen imagines shouting to her.   Then it dawns on him.   The one-legged girl and the Robin Hood - Elf - Dwarf - Whatever crossover!   They are needed, and they are needed badly. But they're gone.   Jeroen stops moving. There is nothing to move to anyway. Jeroen Rock isn't much bigger than Jeroen himself.   He clears his throat.   "We need a third party," he says.   Or actually, he whispered it.   We enter the domain of fiction.   "A third party?" Chrestomanci asks, quickly but casually running a hand through her hair... "Elaborate."   "Elaborate please."   "Elaborate, please."   Language is not mathematical. Language is a form of warfare.   "I was thinking of this," Jeroen says.   He takes a seat, close to Chrestomanci, but distant at the same time.   At least his parents taught him manners.   He clears his throat again.   English would have been a more useful lesson   Then Jeroen starts typing, stops typing, continues typing, erases the whole sentence, and repeats this process several times.   One, two, three, more, minutes pass by.   Finally, and almost unexpected - Chrestomanci is already IM-ing a TSO friend to discuss the new fluffy rabbit shoes they got - a message appears on screen.   "I'm sorry," it says. "I think game is gonna crash."   A second message, saying: "+the," immediately follows.   Chrestomanci remains silent for a moment, probably appalled by this astounding anticlimax, then she replies: "Awwww. :/ ".   She's such a friendly girl.   Or woman.   Jeroen stands up and taps the cursor keys a little.   You see?   Heavy lag.   Quickly he logs out.   Next day events take place that make all talk about third parties out of line.   Not to mention fences.    --------------------------------------------------------------------  - Jeroen de Groot, ESL student Class 4a, Ms. C. Bard

      I love my RL friends dearly...but getting together with them is often like a smartass convention.  You have to be on your game, or you get slaughtered!  Everything is fair game...nothing is sacred.  Add alcohol, and things can get pretty damn amusing...as long as you're not the target!  I'm tempted to say that I'm the worst of the bunch for busting chops...but they sure do give me a run for my money. It all starts with my friend's father...he's known me since I was 12.  He *cough* lovingly refers to me as "The Beotch". Being greeted in that manner certainly sets the tone...and then it's a vicious cycle where we all try to one-up each other.  Sounds rough, I know...but we spend the majority of our time together near tears we're laughing so hard.    Honestly though, we're all very loving and devoted...we're the family that we got to CHOOSE.  So as it turns out, in our circles, those zingers we send at each other are actually a form of affection, a sign of our endearment.  The way I see it, that's true love and friendship...being so comfortable with each other that we can filet our friends with mock insults and not only do we not take offense, we find it hilarious.  Of course, we ARE nice to each other now and then, but obviously that isn't nearly as fun for us.  After all, if we can't laugh at ourselves we may be tempted to take ourselves too seriously...and that's just plain dangerous if you ask me. ;)  So if I seem mean, or you think I'm insulting you...*cough* Neruda *cough*... it actually means I LIKE you.  It's when I'm nice that you have to watch out. *evil grin*  Can you guess what they bust my ass about most?  *nods*  Yes, my computer addiction.  When my friend asked where I was going next weekend, and I said it was "computer related"...she just shook her head slowly and said nothing.  Leaving the Queen smartass speechless...priceless!

      My Saturday Nights are usually pretty boring.  It's my longest day at work and I usually have to catch a late train back to Connecticut.  While other people are going out and having a good time I'm on a crowded train full of annoying children and the even more annoying adults who brought them into the world.  The good thing about this is that the noise keeps me awake enough that I don't fall asleep, miss my stop, and end up all the way out in New Haven.  Anyway, when I finally do get home I'm usually to exhausted to even think about doing anything and fall asleep within the hour.  Last night was different.  We had a slew of tour cancellations which meant that everyone got to go home early.  I caught a train that go me back to Fairfield before nine!  Aldo and I decided to go out to dinner at this fun seafood place with a view of the Sound.  We got there and discovered that the town was doing their fireworks display that night as well.  We had an excellent view, as well as a good meal.  It was a winning combination.  I'm not much of a drinker; well maybe a better way to phrase that is that I have no tolerance for liquor.  We split a bottle of chianti and by my second glass I was pretty darn buzzed.  If drunkeness exposes our true self, then I must be a happy person at heart.  I was smiling and giggling about pretty much everything.    Chianti is good stuff.  Usually I'm more of a merlot kind of girl, but I think I'm going to start ordering it more often.

      I remember when I first brought it home. So small, it's cute little circuits, innocent little buttons and not to mention shinier then my old one. I just had to love it. Got it all set up and cozy in my office, then pulled my eyes out in frustration every other week trying to get the stupid thing to work. No, we're not talking about a toaster (that's another entry for another day}, we are talking about my computer.  Although my current computer's service was short (I only got it in December), it seems to be on it's death bed... literally.  All the fond memories we shared, playing TSO... and um... talking in Yahoo, making insane signatures for Stratics etc etc... it always gave me trouble. I don't think I will miss it! Perhaps I will stamp "good riddance" on its forehead and send if off to some boot camp to get it in shape (har har har).  Ok, so I'm just pissed at my computer, its being a jerk. Maybe I forgot our anniversary... or it's birthday? WHO THE HELL KNOWS! I could blame this all on the computer... but I must take some responsibility. I tried my best, I guess that wasn't enough so the computer has shunned me away, "jdfkahsdakihdkjahd.dll required, please restore" is just its way of saying, "Let's start seeing other people." Bitter sweet rejection... After I gave it such a nice home!  Ok, I'm done with weird ranting; My computer is broken, for how long I cannot say! I can't even get passed the start up screen! It's really awful! I thought I would post something here since I probably wont be logging into TSO or Yahoo, or anything for that matter as much, which can be expected when your computer can now be outrivaled by a key chain flash light for entertainment. Hey, at least I can make shadow puppets with that, the soft blue glow of an error screen just doesn't provide enough light to capture the depth of my characters! Maybe I will get a real life now... maybe just maybe... Oh, and someone tell the Nayrooduh he can have my computer now! (I bet he says, “Bah!")  Anywhoo, I will still check in from time to time by hijacking others computers (like right now), but until I get my computer  working again, and at this rate it will probably be days, you will not be graced with my presence often. So please console each other and mourn me as much as you see fit!   Corn

      As we all have had drilled into our heads forever, America is made up of 50 states. Nice round number! 50 States, 50 stars on the flag, keeps everything nice and normal. Well, that is for normal people.  Growing up I always spent part of my summers at my Grandfather's house in Florida. Yes yes, who wasn't shipped off with "good riddance" stamped on their forehead in the summer? However, this was always a highly odd summer vacation, if you could even call it that. My Grandfather was a highly unusual man. A summer at his house was usually referred to as "Grandpa's Boot Camp" in a non-joking manor. So me and my evil twin brother were sent off and put at each others throats in a competitions of academics and playing try-to-win-Grandpa's-favor games. Although there was time for relaxing and fun usually there was time set aside each day that had to be dedicated to academics and/or physical training. Of course the daily curriculum chosen by the old man himself depending on what kind of mood he was in. There was always some task waiting for you in the morning; Often there were tests in the afternoon to go along with whatever it was you were doing/learning in that said morning.  Ok so now you are thinking, "My god Corn has gone completely off topic!" I'm getting to that mythical 51st state...  Anywhoo, one time my grandpa had made this puzzle of all 50 states, and I was just suppose to put it together. Simple enough, right? WRONG! The problem was, despite his tendencies for perfection, he had managed to make a puzzle that didn't quite fit together right at all. My best guess is he didn't want it to be to easy, so all the states were rough shapes. But... one problem, some areas left big gaps. Also keep in mind, none of these states were labeled, I was suppose to be able to identify them on sight! So I soon find this particularly odd shaped state, pretty much an indefinable blob. As I continue to put this map together this little state just doesn't seem to be fitting in, much less identifiable. So, being the slow one I am I finally for some reason count the pieces. 51. Can't be right, I count again... 51! Kept counting... 51! Bah! So eventually I'm getting this thing together anyway and I soon discover the South Eastern USA just is giving me trouble. Finally I figure to try mystery blob in there, and tada!!! It all fits kind of nicely. So, apparently as I later found out, this was an abstract state created by my grandfather because his puzzle was flawed. It was called Williamsylvania (named after him of course see I'm not the only egomaniac in the family!).      So, just a reminder, if my education/knowledge base is slightly off, obscured, lacking, bizarre, or any other adjective blame it on my grandfather!  *This was a little trip down memory lane*  Corn

      I just saw a commercial for a refrigerator with a TV in it.   A TV, folks.  It keeps your food cold *and* assaults your children with various ways to absorb popular culture...all before breakfast.  I'm on a mission against TVs In Things That Shouldn't Have TVs.  As a child, I read books.  I had to learn to entertain myself in the car with little more than a piece of paper, a crayon, and a paper clip.  I began to understand hydrodynamics, perspective, depth perception, and relative speed all because our only TV was in the living room.  Not the kitchen, not the bedroom, not the car.  What are we teaching our next generation if everything they encounter has some sort of installation that endeavors to actively entertain them?  On the other hand, I live with a man who grew up doing nothing but watching TV.  He was in the hospital a lot as a child due to a birth defect he's got, and couldn't do much *but* lie on his back and watch the boob tube.  Because of that he has a severe case of dyslexia, and has trouble reading even the simplest things; even attempting books gives him a headache.  It has been a chasm during our entire relationship that I have tried really hard to overcome.  I find entertainment in words, in books and chat rooms and magazines and billboards and even in the local bank's warning sign that says to beware of people squirting you with ketchup or mustard at the ATM.  (Picture pending.)  When I'm not watching a certain show, I turn the damn thing off.  But then I come here.  Which he doesn't get.  I have already decided that my children will not have a TV in their bedrooms.  We won't have one in the kitchen, and we won't have one in our bedroom, either.  We will have one in the living room and possibly another in some sort of play area depending on the layout of the house, but none of them will stay on unless someone's watching it.  If there's one thing I will demand of my children, it's that they use their freaking imagination.  And Barney just ain't gonna cut it.
