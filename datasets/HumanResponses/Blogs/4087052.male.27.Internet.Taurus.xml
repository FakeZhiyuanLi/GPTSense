       Right, I've started a wee blog. Can't be cunted posting anything just now as I'm working, but rest assured this page will start filling with shitey mince as soon as I can be arsed, probably any time I'm at work.     Gaahhhh, something that really does my box in is the drop down menu country boxes. "Where do I come from you ask, well, put FUCKING Scotland in the drop down and I'll tell you. But no, United Kingdom it has to be, even although there are all manner of tiny insignificant countries in that list, Scotland gets no mention. Fuckers.    &nbsp;  And as for forcing me to put my date of birth in Month/Day/Year format? Don't get me started.Fucking don't.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;

      Well, still got the shits. Was packing solids when I woke up this morning but it seems my bowels have turned to liquid in the past 2 hours. Great.  Played a bit of Red Orchestra last night when I got home from work. New version (3.0) scheduled for release on 27th August. Got into an amazing battle on Kaukusus, that game is fucking amazing. Better be able to get broadband in our new flat or I may have to scrape my own face off with blunt knives.  Currently looking for a new flat, seen a really nice 4 bedroom in the West End, upstairs downstairs, parking, girl seems to not want students and has asked us to email her with a 'run-down' on ourselves. Looks like we'll have to use our "by day" personalities, ie 4 serious mature young professionals holding down vital jobs, and not our "by night" ones ie 4 fucking wasters, stoned out their faces all the time, only looking forward to the weekend so they can stay in their fucking beds, or go out and get wasted.  She's only showing it from start of September though, and we're needing something from 13th so it may be a biut of a tight squeeze. Also, Belson has to get a job before we move in, or it's a big no-go and probably a 3 bedroom on the South Side. Hopefully she'll like our banter as nice 4 bedroom flats are hard to come by in the West End, especially at this time of year, with students descending on the place again, and shady landlrds renting out death trap pig-stys to said students who give not a fuck about the state of their houses.  That is all for now.

      Monday. Shite.  Feeling pretty ropey today to be honest. Have done nothing but spray hot liquid faeces pretty much since I woke up. That'll be caning it a little too hard at the weekend payback time.  Well, that party was absolutely fucking amazing. Easily the best House Party I've ever attended. In the middle of nowhere, this guy basically owns a large house/flat type thing in which he also runs his business. Downstairs is basically just a club, with a cool chill-out toom full of sofas, and even public toilets.  Everyone there was having a great time, shame it finished as early as 5 am. Then we (Me, Kate, Karnowski, Rich, Roly, Clair and Nick, Dancing Paul and Leeanne) fired back to Glasgow to do some drinking. Went up to their (amazing) new house and Clair and Karnowski went and bought Mushrooms from some guy they met - he grows them himself. Everyone took a full dose, but being a bit of a Hallucinogen Homosexual I decided only to take half a dose. Good choice old chum.   Everyone was totally out of theuir faces, in a kind of "We've all turned into feral beasts, primeval man" type way, barely managing to utter sentances that made any sense; Karnowski actually struggling for 1 minutes to just get out the words, "How does   everything  work. It wasn't pretty.  In fairness, my wee half dose was quite enjoyable, but I could see that even a little more would be brutally heavy duty.  About 3 hours after taking them, everybody sobered up just enough to be able to leave Paul and Leeannes to take on the treck to mine.  Karnoski and Kate bolted for his flat, but the rest of us went down the Kelvingrove Park for a couple of hours, Nick fell in the river (FUCKING hilarious) and then some fascist Park Keeper cuntos came and moved us from where we were sitting next to the river as "We were encouraging children to jump into the river" More like you just don't like us sitting here you fucking arseholes. Give someone a tiny ballbag of Power and they'll abuse it as much as they possibly can. Dicks.  Managed to pluck up the courage to escape from the park and go to Cat's where I sat and dribbled rubbish to her for an hour or so before she phoned us a taxi to mine, and then chips then bed.  Excellent weekend though, roll on the next 'un.  Hopefully this week it'll be Monox vs Radar at the Soundhaus on Saturday. Pretty much my wet dream best ever possible night.  Nice.  Oh, didn't get that job. Bastard.

      Friday it is then. What plans for the weekend?  Well, I finish at half past five and will be sitting in my car rolling a doob until 5:35, then the big drive home, get in for 6 and fire up Red Orchestra I think. Rich's pal Roly is firing over for the weekend from Northern Ireland and is crashing at ours, so I reckon a few spliffs will be splifftoed. Then I'll be firing over to the West End to see Mr. Big and get restocked on supplies befre meeting Cat at 11 at Jenkins' party. Then back to her flat for a small smoke and bed I think.  Tomorrow will be filled by visiting my mum and dad (it being rico's birthday) and preparing for thiks all night party banter Saturday night.   I then p[redict Sunday will be filled with drikning and sleeping before starting the ball rolling again on Monday with another week.  So there you have it.  Still heard fuck all about that job interview.

       Going to a free Radar party outside Paisley this weekend - Saturday to be exact. Should be pounding maaaan.             Oh Yes.    Also, I've just started another Thomas Pynchon book, Vineland. So far it's looking pretty much as rich as his other two that I've read, Gravity's Rainbow and V.      Waiting for a T-Shirt to appear through my door at the moment which I bought last week from   urlLink  http://www.5hitflap.com   .      Here is the front design here:

       A strange thing happened last night in Byres Road Safeway.      I'd just been looking at a flat in Great George Streetand me and cat puffed a quick doob before firing up there for our dinner shopping - Never a good idea, suddenly instead of Kedgiree for dinner it's Pizza and crisps and dip.      As we were walking through the store, I saw this not unattractive woman, in the Ruth Campbell type mould. She caught my eye and seemed to catch Cat's as well before walking away.      Me and Cat then split up to find the butter and I came out of an aisle to find that woman smiling at Cat (there was no-one else there - Cat didn't notice though) then she caught my eye for a couple of seconds and looked away.      As we were at the checkout, I noticed that woman in another queue. Her queue went quicker than ours and when she was finished she came and stood next to the videos whjich were at the end of our queue, eating an apple and obviously not looking at the videos. As me and Cat got closer to the checkout, she came round the other side of the videos to stand about a yard from Cat with her back to her. As I said my 'Thank you very much' and prepared to walk to the car park, I noticed this woman had started walking, so she would be walking right alongside us. She had been waiting for us to move. Now, we were going to the car park so we walked a different way from that which she assumed we would go in. The woman turned round, noticed we had gone another way, stopped and stood by the door looking pretty flustered.      What a strange 'un.      Also, I feel really ill.

       Well, another Monday is here and I'm revving up for the week as usual.      Went up Loch Lomond with Karnowski, Rich, Kate, Nick and Clair Woolston, Cat couldnae make it as she was meant to be studying.      It was magic. Camped at that wee place between Balmaha and Rowardennan, a new NO CAMPING OR FIRES sign had been put up but we ignored it and set up camp. We made sure we removed al our rubbish when we left though, so don't feel too bad about it. There were a couple of Neds about, and they left all their rubbish (arseholes) which pissed me off a bit. I mean, they obvioulsy like the beauty of the spot; camping right on the loch side and all that so WHY THE FUCK do they leave all their fuckiong Pot Noodles and disposable barbecues lying about?? You like the beauty of the place so you detract from it by leaving all you shite lying about? Dicks.      Came back yesterday to tend to Cat (hangover - likes to pretend she's ill. awww ) and then we went out to The Parthenon on Great Western Road for our dinner. Very nice, very impressed; very expensive. It was worth it though, had really nice meal of Moussaka (my first) for starter - tasted a wee bit like lasagne - and some chicken with feta cheese and a rich tomato sauce guy. Amazing.      Back to mine and sat for a couple of hours gently puffing doobs before hitting the sack quite early. I'm in agony due to frisbee capers up North, so had to get sleep in an attempt to rid myslef of muscle pain and stiffness. Failed miserably, still in brutal agony.      Kate's birthday this weekend and talk of some kind of Unit/Radar party on Saturday.    Got that interview this afternoon, shat myself in regard to just bolting from work so told boss all. He actually seemed quite pleased that I'd been so honest, but knowing the wee arsepiece he's probably planning my downfall behind my back. Oh Well.    I'll keep you posted. Meh.

       My boss has got into bolting from work rally early. Today he's fled already and it's over an hour before home time.      "What is your beef" I hear you cry. Well, to be honest, sitting skiving at work (which is really all you can do when the boss is gone) takes sooo long. I have about 3 internet sites I ever look at, and it can get pretty longwinded reading the same old same old shite on a daily basis. Oh well. If I had work to do I batter rrrright through it then suddenly it's half 5 and I'm in my car.      Anyway, still no news on the "Monday off" scenario. Will just have to bolt early dinghying all attempted interventions by said bosses if I have to.      Going to my Mum and Dad's tonight in sunny Motherwell (Overtown to be exact for all you Shire-Fiends out there) for the usual massive dinner and sit and watch the telly Wednesday bant. Yas.

       Brilliant. I've got an interview on Monday for a new Über-Joab in Glasgow, cunty-baws of a boss refused to believe my lies about 'going away with my parents for dad's birthday' as my reason for needing the day off. Now I'm just going to have to twangggggggg work and face the oh so brutal consequences. Nice.      What a dick.

       Back at work (fuck) and have launched into a new week with gusto (aye my fucking arse)      Weekend was pretty good. A few cans on Friday night at Cat's, and then party at Belson's Saturday. FUCKING brilliant so and it was, took ages to get going though, didn't really get started till half 1 in the morning.      After that it was business as usual though. Had a cargo of 8 Tennants and a bottle of the famous Brown Wine.      Necked a few ecto as well, which is never dull. Ended up 8 or 9 of us sitting on the roof of the flat (cool as fuck, could imjagine heroically leaping from rooftop to rooftop as I dropped another toid. Meh.) drinking and talking shite. Learned how to play Shithead as well, which looks like it might take over from Switch as my card game of choice.      Some guy had passed out in another room, and sleep-walked in the complete scud through to the room we were in, ending up sitting on the bed Cat was sleeping on. Nay way came the cry as we all urged him to get TAE FUCK and fire some FUCKING clothes on Pal. Don't even know if any cunt new the bawbag.      Down to the Kelvingrove park after carry out shops opened brandishing another botteil du tonic. Tanned that, fired home in a Joseph Baxi in time to pass out for 5pm Sunday. Woke up this morning feeling pretty grim.      Got to work on time though, on time to fucking skive all day that is mwa.
