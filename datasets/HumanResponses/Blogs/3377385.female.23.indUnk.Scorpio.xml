      I'm two for two on weird or gross stuff happening in as many days.   1. Foot Lube Yesterday I had to make the lovely annual visit to the gyno. I tell you there is nothing more fun than lying on a sterile bench in an oddly cut cotton gown with snow flakes on it while the lovely and impersonal doc looks between your legs to poke and prod. Well it was over soon enough and as I was hopping off the table with the stirrups, trying gracefully to avoid being impaled by the nasty metal contraption, I failed to notice a spot of lube my doc had let fall on the ground. Mmmm....nothing like the feeling of lube squishing between you naked foot and the grey clinical linoleum...my one comfort is that the lube was not there before the exam...I think.  2. Peek-a-Potty In an effort to keep hydrated as I continue my daily running in the scorching almost summer heat (yeah, a week and a half and I'm  still  running), I have been drink water like a very thirsty thing. I knew my frequent trips to the toilet at work would not go unnoticed or without incident.   The women's restroom on my floor of our office building is tiny. There are two stalls, rarely are they both occupied, but whenever that does occur, I usually stall until the other person is done washing her hands because there is no room to form a queue for hand sanitation. So, anyhow, I'm in my tiny stall, liquidating my bladder (ha ha ha...you know that's funny) and next to me is a woman and her small child. Boy, girl, I don't know. All I know are little feet and a little voice. Apparently the little one finished it's business and was seized by insuppressible curiosity.   One moment I was contemplating how long I'd have to stall until my neighbors were finished with their business and hand washing as I looked down at the avocado green linoleum (why do people insist on linoleum?...it's really hideous.) the next moment I was looking down into the brown impish eyes of the child in the stall next to me. It (he? she?) had squatted down, the way only small children can, to peek under the partition to see who it's neighbor was.   What do you do with your pants around your ankles, underwear at knees, sitting on the porcelain thrown and a child playing potty peek-a-boo?

      Yesterday I went to one of my favorite places to watch people, a local dirty college coffee house. I was sitting in the hot sun reading an appropriately pretentious-cool book ( urlLink Lipstick Traces: A secret history of the 20th century  by Griel Marcus) when I noticed these two girls sitting near me, studying for their finals. I'm sure they were high school and they were so perfectly trendy it was unbelievable. It was not the kind of "plastics" trendy, but the "I'm not trying so hard, but I'm so counter culture, look at this bracelet I got at Claire's!" bleached hair, pink eye shadow, very eighties punk sheik. . . It was great. Oh how I remember when I was in high school and tried to rebel, being so perfectly what  urlLink seventeen   magazine said was cool, which had been another generation's counter culture.   I, however, was no better. The only reason I went to that coffee shop was that I'd just gotten a killer new  urlLink T-shirt  I was wearing that day and I didn't want it's first day to be in my house. I had a need to take this new shirt out, show it off to the world, and show the world how cool I am because I have this shirt. It really is cute.

I will try to save my pennies, maybe my sister and i can go there next year, loaf around kreutzberg, be bums, have fun. some of the best memories i have of the last year took place in berlin. if you ever have the oppertunity to go to berlin, take it...and then take me.

      last night, while my body was exhausted from my ill advised run, but my mind was still alive and alert and unwilling to go to sleep i flipped on the tv and happened to catch a cool film. it's called "for our man" and it's a strange short film by kazuo ohno. narrated in english, dialogue in german, "for our man" shows the frustration of the creative process of writing through fast paced circularity. it was shown on public television through the  urlLink southwest alternative media project , but more specifically, a program called  urlLink the territory  check it out. there's some other great small time indie film stuff there

      i hate running. i am morally opposed to running. the only time this practice is acceptable is when someone or something is chasing you. why then did i go running yesterday? because i want to like running. i have a similar feeling about tomatoes. i really don't like them, but i want to because i know so many people  really really enjoy eating them. they make great sauces, salads are prettier with a dash of red, i  want  to like them. i'm trying, and i actually voluntarily eat some tomatoes. i don't pick them off my sandwitch or salad anymore, but i still don't really enjoy them.   i want to like running. i want to be one of those people who can run for half and hour without stopping, fainting, or throwing up (like my best friend). if i force myself to run a couple of times a week maybe i'll get better at it, maybe i'll learn to like it (or at least not hate it). but right now, i'm not sure my body is up to the challenge.

      so, like many others out there i have been persuaded by the diet industry to fear fat and be very nervous about my carbohydrate consumption. seeing as that 3/4 of my family has diabetes, perhaps concern over my carb consumption is not unreasonable or over reactive, but that's not the point to my story. i really like yogurt...well actually i go in phases of loving and hating yogurt. yoplait has this new type of yogurt that is both low fat AND low carbs. i bought it, my favorite flavor - peach creme, with the hopes that it would be as good as their wonderful light yogurt. unfortunately this is not the case.   it's unusually thick, which disturbed me a little. it tasted alright at first, but then after the first swallow of it's creamy thickness i noticed something else. it felt like eating lotion. it was missing that wonderful astringency of regular yogurt and coated my mouth with a thick film of artificial sweetener and questionable fats. i ask you, have we gone too far? low fat, low sugar and the feeling of moisturizing my gums...hmmm...i'm not too sure of that.

      so, as you can tell this is my first blog.   it's the first posting of my first blog ever.   i really don't even write in a journal (that's a lie), what am i doing writing in a blog? (is it "in a blog", or "on a blog?" or "writing a blog" like a book? or maybe it's with a blog...like some kind of crazy pen.) the big reason is boredom. having recently graduated college, i find myself with so much time on my hands that i need a hobby. i've been trying to learn how to play the guitar, that's a noble hobby (i played the cello for ten years...maybe more). recently i've taken to going to one of my favorite coffee houses in town and getting hours of people watching in. i just finished reading Jeffrey Eugenides' Middlesex and like all amazingly well written books, it inspired me to write. so now i watch people and i write about them. that may seem a little creepy, maybe it is, but i enjoy it and it's not like i'm stalking anyone.    so, i'm not going to go on with some arduous personal history, because it's really not that interesting, and i figure over time things will come out, and if you're really that interested in my history, email me and i'll answer whatever questions i feel like answering. at this time i am reminded of Michel Foucault and his 1970 lecture to the college de france entitle "the discourse on language" (by the way you can find it in the appendix to his "archeology of knowledge") and he goes on and on and on about this anxiety he has on how to start the lecture. i have my own anxiety on how to start a blog. (please note the pretentious college grad reference to obscure french philosopher)  I will now start. . . ready. . . set. . . GO!

      There have been many exciting new things happening in the last few days. First of, there is the fabulous background to my blog which I love. The kinks are quickly moving from charming to annoying. As a friend pointed out to me last night, there is no space or link for comments like the old format had. I really liked that, and apparently others did too, but I don't know how to write HTML and the code for the background didn't have it already in there. I'm resourceful, I'll figure it out somehow. The Google add in the upper middle of the page also irritates me, but I don't think there is a way I can subvert that...it's kind of the price for a free web log.   This weekend was quite full of fun. I took it easy Friday night, went to shabbat services with my padres, went home and designed some new jewelry. Saturday I went to see  urlLink Fahrenheit: 9/11   with my best friend. It was really powerful, and extremely disturbing. When the movie was over and my friend and I were walking out we were so silent. I was sort of freaked out and when I got home, emotionally and psychically exhausted my sister tip-toed out of her room and wanted to chat. She asked me about the film and all I could say was "It was powerful." I really didn't want to talk about it just yet. It was sort of a scaled down version of what I felt after visiting Auschwitz. It was too raw to share with someone who hadn't seen it. I totally encourage you, my readers, to see it if you haven't already.   Sunday was a very busy day for me. I got up and after a debate with my Dad inspired by Fahrenheit I went for a long walk. I walked about five miles around Town Lake and ran into someone I think could very well have been Heath Ledger walking a tinny rich man's dog. That afternoon my friend and I want to see her cousin in a benefit performance. Some big local theatre person is doing a walk with the  urlLink Komen Foundation  for breast cancer research. She got all her theatre buddies together and said "hey! Let's put on a show!" And did they ever. It was well done and well performed but it was long. Long, long, long. I think it would have been greatly enhanced by the removal of about a dozen tunes. And instead of doing thirty songs they could have done with some small props, choreography and minor costume change to spice it up a bit. Anyhoo...it was a very good cause, I hope they raised a lot of money. A super cool thing happened for cousin-performer...she made a great connection with one of the other participants who's a director and puts together a weekly(?) cabaret performance at some club (apparently he's some kind of a big wig in the local theatre scene). He wants her to sing with the show. Yippeee! And tomorrow she'll be on Broadway, I just know it!.   So...Sunday evening I went to a trunk show at a local anti-gallery gallery. It's called  urlLink Parts & Labour   and is on South Congress for all you Austinites out there. It's all locally made stuff and it's way way super cool. You can check out some of the artists and designers at the  urlLink Austin Craft Mafia  web page. The cool thing is, I was talking to some of the folks there and I have an appointment Friday to bring in some of my jewelry to be considered to sell on consignment. Last night I designed a super cool logo and a business card, tonight through Friday morning I'm gonna be busting my ass to make and design some new pieces and clean up some of my old ones. I'll let y'all know how it goes.

      As you may have noticed, my blog is looking a little different today. I found this really amazing backround at  urlLink Blog Skins . It was designed by Niekki, who is absolutly brilliant and creative and has many many many beautiful skins. There are some little problems, and when I figure out how to fix them I will. I will also get all the links up and running again as soon as I get a chance.  In other news, I'm going to some great caberet show tonight that my best friend's cousin is in. I'm sure it will be fabulous and I'll tell y'all all about it later.

       urlLink    Great Balls o' Fire, (Tate Modern Art museum, London)   So, a picture is worth a thousand words, eh? Well, maybe so, but a picture also makes a blog more interesting. I have a goal of putting pictures on my web log as a regular habit sort of thing, the only real problem is that the only pictures I have on CD or saved on my computer are from last fall when I was abroad. So y'all have to suffer pictures that have very little to do with what is actually going on in my life.  This week has been relatively uneventful. Wednesday night I went to a local coffee shop I frequent all on my lonesome and happened to run into my old roommate (and current very good friend) and her boy friend (also a good friend). We hung out and chatted as I watched them play an rousing game of batgammon. These two crack me up! They are so competitive when they play games together and are obsessed with batgammon. I've never played the game before, but I equate it with old men in a park. Of course, I'm a big fan of dominos, another old man game.   Yesterday I hung out with my best friend from school and her girl friend for a little while. We got some dinner and drinks. It was great to catch up, and then after about fifteen minutes of catching up I thought, "well, that's it for me, nothing else new. geeze, I'm a boring geezer." It's crazy how much my life has changed since graduating. Mostly my life is kinda dull and I don't see my friends half as often as I'd like to.

      Not surprisingly, I'm finding that I have the same problem in maintaining a web log that I do in maintaining a physical journal. Life is slow slow slow and so I don't write, then life speeds up and a bunch of supper cool stuff happens and I'm too busy to write about it. So here is the update on my past week.     Tuesday:  Still recovering from recent wisdom tooth extraction, I decided that working out would be a good idea, I blame it on the narcotics. It was not such a good idea. I spent the rest of the night at home, watching movies with ice packs flanking my face. My cheeks and mouth became so numb that I later spilled water all down my front because I couldn't feel the glass with my lips. Through all of this, however, I saw a fabulous  urlLink film  about a lesbian/feminist chorus called  urlLink Amasong . I was moved...really.    Wednesday:  Feeling much much better on Wednesday, I'm nearly up to full mastication and I've graduated from yogurt and pudding to spaghetti, soft cooked veggies and just about anything softer than steak and beef jerky. This is a relatively uneventful day.    Thursday:  So this is where things really start to get interesting. The day passes much like every other day...work, exercise, gum down some food. Instead of our regular routine of post work afternoon of Dr. Phil, Ophra and Jeopardy my best friend and I branch out and watch  urlLink Bottle Rocket , definitely a new favorite.   Anyhoo...one of our friends recently started performing with a fetish troupe called Flesh Assembly and he invited us to a show at a local club. We donned our best fetish outfits and headed downtown. I really must say that my outfit was quite lovely. Try as a might I have difficult time looking trampy, and I've tried...a lot. Even in my fishnets, stilettos, dog collar and inch long false eyelashes I still looked classy. This was my first fetish show, and I think I was somewhat under prepared for the intensity of the experience. It was about what you would imagine a bondage fetish show to be. A lot of nakedness, a lot of spanking, whips, chains, hot wax, and a woman with a classic stripper body in a nun's habit black leather thong with a big black strap on. We were so proud of our friend...he sure does know how to tie someone up. I'm excited to go to their next show.    Friday:  I sent most of the day recovering from the night before. One week post op, I went back to see the oral surgeon who said everything was healing really well, but there is some concern that I may have developed a touch of the TMJ to I get to see him again next Friday for another follow up. That's fine with me....I really like my oral surgeon.   There's a new intern in my office, she's about my age and we hit it off pretty well. Earlier in the week we exchanged number in the idea that maybe we'd hang out some time. I never really thought it would happen because I don't really call people. She called and invited me to a party Friday night. We went and it was supper fun. I bought a bottle (very large bottle) of this crazy potent Belgium Ale called Delirium Tremmons to bring to the fiesta. I figured "It's Belgium and has pink elephants on the label, how can you go wrong?" It was a fun party, I met some supper cool folks and one glass of the Delirium Tremmons knocked me on my ass. I totally recommend it.    Saturday:  UUUHHHHGGGG....spent all day recovering from last night, but now I ready to go out again.

      So, as you may have noticed (my small and faithful readership) I haven't posted in a little while. Friday I had my wisdom teeth out. I actually prefer to say that I had oral surgery. It sounds so much more dramatic. Everyone has their wisdom teeth out...but it's a big deal to have "ORAL SURGERY". It wasn't too bad, really. I had opted to be put totally under, but they were unable to do it because of some familial medical condition that would basically result in death. So instead we went for the half keg drug. It's the kind of sedative they give you that you kinda know what's going on, but you really don't care. My memories are hazy of the event, and with time they will become hazier and hazier until I may completely forget the entire experience...kind of like college.  Right now I have the charming swollen look of a very cute chipmunk with glasses. I'm back at work fro the first day. It's my first day without vikadin (mmm...that stuff is great!). We'll see how long I make it. I've been here for half an hour and I want to go back to bed.

      Sometimes I think that I took a wrong turn somewhere along the way. I wasn't meant to be a social activist. I was really meant to be on the stage, a Broadway super star, dancing and singing, hanging out with overly dramatic theatre folks, being the hagiest of fag hags, doing eight shows a week and loving every second of it. I feel this most strongly when I watch musicals or the  urlLink Tony Awards .   Last night, as you well might know, was the Tony Awards. I watch them religiously. This is kind of an odd practice since it's rare that I've actually seen or even heard of the shows or performers who are nominated (I usually do well with the musical revivals, and I'm okay on the play revivals). The beautifully fabulous and versatile Hugh Jackman hosted last night and besides possessing the ability to make my heart flutter like a little school girl's, he's got these crazy long legs which he put to great use doing a high kick routine with The Rockettes. He took the Tony for best actor in a new musical for his performance of Peter Alan in "The Boy from Oz".   There where two incredibly surreal moments of the evening. The first was LL Cool J and Carol Channing presenting an award together...odd, but very endearing. The second was performance from the nominated musical revival "Assassins". This is a musical about presidential would be and successful assassins, from John Wilks Booth to Lee Harvey Oswald to the guy who shot Reagan (I'm always forgetting his name). It was bizarre, a sort of Sienfeldian moment.   Perhaps when I'm old and rich and very eccentric I'll get to be that crazy theatre supporter in New York everyone loves.

      I'm pretty low on inspiration at the moment. I'm at work and I really just want to go home and take a nap. The only thing that keeps me going is this absolutely fantastic magazine I recently discovered at a local independent book store.  urlLink HEEB  is the best new jew mag I've ever seen. It's really the only new jew mag I've ever seen. It's written by and for young punky Jews about young punky shit. I don't now what else to say. You should just check it out. I would strongly caution you against reading it at work or in a quiet space with other people. I laughed so loud and hard I nearly peed my pants.

      I have a very close friend who's parents are Cuban and Mexican (one's Cuban, the other's Mexican). Every year they throw a "lechon" or a "Cuban Pig Part" as my friend likes to call it. It's fabulously festive with lots of wine, rum, illegal cigars and a giant roasted pig. Now, I'm Jewish and as a rule I try to avoid pig. I'm not very devout, but I at least make the attempt, or feel the guilt when I eat it. But once a year I feast on pig and enjoy it and forgo all guilt.   The last pig parties they threw were met with some sort of horror and this year was no exception. Two years ago it was the case of the dispensation oven. This cinder block monstrosity that my friend's dad built with some local braseros took way too long to heat and we waited hours and hours before the pig was done.   Last year it was the case of frankenpig. Not surprisingly, it takes some work and planning to order a whole pig for roasting. The order had been placed several weeks before the party and when it came time to pick up the pig, the pig had been sold to someone else. They searched the city, but alas could not find a whole pig anywhere. Problem solvers that they were, they found two sides and ahead from three different pigs. A family friend, who happened to be a surgeon sewed the parts together creating the gruesome "Frankenpig"  This year's lechon was met with similar drama. First, the pig that had been ordered did not come when expected. A suitable pig finally arrived, about twenty pounds too big and without a head. Never the less, this pig was set to roast in the hot box for the required time. However, for some inexplicable reason the pig was finished much earlier than anticipated. The meat fell off the spit in three pieces into the hot coals beneath. There was a mad scramble to retrieve the pig and salvage it's pieces. People were cut and burned in the process...and none of us got to see the wonderfully barbaric display of roast pig on stick while we sing "poor piggy who gave it's life for us to eat" in drunken Spanish.    But it was still quite tasty.

      So, I know I haven't posted in a long time, but for once I'm actually kinda busy at work. I will give a bigger update soon. But I must say, today is starting out as an absolutly marvelous day. Yesterday I screwed up my back and was foreced to call off work and lay on the floor with a heating pad. Today I'm actually pain free, I went swimming before work and that was absolutly fabulous. I have a lovely breakfast of Puffins (this great wheat free cerial) an egg and half of the sourest grapefruit you've ever tasted. The drive to work was lovely and I saw the longest train EVER running along the highway. I'm going to see The Vilage this afternoon con mi hernana. It's shaping up to be a really nice day.

      The following story is a complete work of fiction, any resemblance to actual people and events is purely coincidental.      One upon a time there was a Shakespeare festival out in the country, in a small town in Texas called Winedale. Two friends decided that they would like to go see a play that the sister of one of their friends was in. The friends, Emma and Annie called their friend Dave and said they'd meet him at Winedale. With directions Emma got off the internet, she and Annie set off on their adventure to see a play in a barn.     Not knowing where Winedale was and only knowing the west end of the highway on the directions, Emma and Annie went west into the beautiful Texas Hill Country. Dave had said it took about two hours to get there, so after driving many miles west, neither Annie nor Emma thought anything of it. After about an hour and a half of driving Emma remarked to Annie, "I'm a little disturbed that we haven't seen any signs for Winedale, or Lagrange, where we've supposed to turn."     "Yeah, me too. Do you have a Texas map in this car?" Annie got out the map as Emma pulled over. Looking to see how much further they had to drive, Annie realized their error. Emma had taken them almost a hundred miles west when they should have been going east to whole time.     Overcome with the absurdity of their mistake all either of them could do was laugh. The laughed all the way back to Austin.        They never saw the play, but they did see the amazing beauty of the Texas Hill Country. An unusually rainy summer offered up lush greens, blooming wild flowers and yellow sunflowers dotting the country side.

      Last night I was hanging out with AF (please note, I'm gonna start using initials now to make things easier, "AF" was referred to "best friend"...don't worry, she still is). A friend of ours from high school called saying he was going to karaoke night at&nbsp;this bar a couple of blocks from her&nbsp;house. This bar, Boomerz, is a kind of&nbsp;sketchy neighborhood country type place. I've been there once before and I really had no desire to ever go back.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well...we went to karaoke night at Boomerz and I had the best time ever! I actually got up and sang my first solo kareoke performance. I did a nice, if somewhat wobbly rendition of "Cry&nbsp;Me a River" (no, not the Justin Timberlake song, but the softer croonier old school song). Apparently some folks thought I have a future as a lounge singer...ah, now I know I can pursue my dream of singing in smoky bars and clubs....karaoke is the answer.

      Do any of you out there watch Jeopardy? I'm living the summer life, which includes a good amount of day time television. I love Jeopardy, but since Ken Jennings has set up home in the Sony studios the one thing that keeps me coming back is to see the day he is defeated. Maybe today is the day...maybe tomorrow...maybe next tuesday, all I know is that I want to be there, tuned in to see it when it happens.   In the mean time, I suggest you read this terrifying  urlLink look  at the future should Ken Jennings never be unseated.

      Yeah yeah yeah, I know I keep changing the look of my web log, but I just can't seem to settle on just one template. I love changing them,I love figuring out the new looks I can give them. This one was obviously inspired by the piece of propaganda style *NERD* poster from nerdelite. Maybe I'll write one from scratch some day.

      So, my office boredom has come to intersect with my disenchantment with singledom and sexual frustration. I spent the first hour of work today browsing the profiles of men in my age range in and around the Washington, DC area on the Jewish singles matching making website  urlLink J Date . I'm moving to DC in about six weeks. I want to see what kind of fellas they have in our nation's capital and since I'm out of this office in a little more than a month, I'm not concerned that they may fire me for inappropriate use of office resources, although I do have the good sense to look really busy when ever my boss comes by. And I really do plenty of real work while I'm here...really.   Here is a sample of what DC may have to offer:    pretty nice, eh?  and there is also...    and...    I'm really looking forward to the possibilities. Odds are that I'll be just as single and frustrated there are I am here. Good thing my move has to do with something completely separate from getting an MRS. Unfortunately I may never meet any of these particular people because JDate makes you pay to contact members and to recieve messages and I refuse to pay for an online match making service. Oh well.

        Stephen Merritt of The Magnetic Fields  I bought the new  urlLink Magnetic Fields  CD called "i" this weekend. It's really different than some of the stuff I usually listen to, but I totally love it. I recommend it, but listen with an open mind, it might be a bit of an acquired taste.   ps: did you know Christy Yamaguchi is 32 today? How did she get so old?

         This weekend I was part of my first surprise party ever! One of my best friends from school was turning the big two three. Her girl friend decided it would be a great idea to do a surprise party. It was thrown together quickly and had the oddest mix of people EVER! But it was fun fun fun. The guest of honor was completely surprised, I was proud and sneaky.   Okay, so since this is my web log, I can talk about myself unashamedly. Friday afternoon before the party I died my hair black and cut my bangs very short and blocky. As my girl described it, my hair was "very Chicago...very Velma Kelley," and I must admit, I thought it looked pretty good. My hair was the topic of about five different conversations at the party, and when my old roommate's boyfriend put a red geranium blossom in my hair all hell broke loose. People would not stop talking about it. I do enjoy being the center of attention, but this was a little out of control. All I could say was "thanks" slightly embarrassed but very pleased. I was really looking hot that night.

      this is a little experiment to see how I can get pictures on my blog without using "hello".      cool, eh.

      Okay, once again, as you can see, I have changed the look of my blog. It's nice to have something so impermanent, although some of y'all might find it frustrating. Embrace the zen that blogging could be. There were some definite kinks with the last background that thanks to my ineptitude with HTML and ever increasing levels of frustration, these "kinks" were quickly becoming serious problems.   You will notice that there is once again a functioning comments link so please feel free to comment freely and frequently. I've really missed your comments. Yeah, that's right... your  comments...you know who you are.   I know this look is a bit more plain than that last one that was so flashy , but I like to think of it as "cleanly modern". I've finally decided to stop suppressing my femme-ish-ness and let it all hang out. This definitely has a very girly, but hip look to it (hopefully the way I do). Soon I will post an update on my life and the happenings of the last week. I know you're spending sleepless nights aching to know what you fantasy (or real?) friend Bell has been up to.   Patience my dear, patience...

      Wednesday night I went out with my best friend. A friend of her's from college (a snooty north eastern all women's college that hosts alumni like Senator Clinton) can into town for a very short time to visit. I sort of invited myself along. It was quite a fabulous time and since I wasn't driving I was drinking liberally. We had dinner, hit up a few bars, played pool, air hockey, did a little dancing, it was great great great.   On the drive home, it got bad. For the first time I my life I had to have my girl pull over for me to vomit out the car door. You know how your sense of balance is all off when your drunk? Well, so I was leaning out the door and I lost my balance, rolled out of the car and into my pool of vomit. It was an all time low. The rest of the drive is a little hazy, I stuck my head out the window and continued to vomit, it streaked across the side of the car and a little on the inside of the door. I spent the night at my friend's house on my knees in the bathroom. I was really really sick for a really really long time. My girl took such good care of me. Somehow I made it to bed (I don't remember getting there, but that's where I woke up, curiously and inexplicably naked). I was in bed all day Thursday, the hangover was harsh, but looking back on it now I'm really happy I woke up at all. I'm done with drinking for a while. Or at least a few days.
