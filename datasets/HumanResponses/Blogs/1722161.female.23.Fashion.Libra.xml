						   it's all around me. people, as distinct entities, and the way they behold each other. the way they interact with each other, with me, me with them.. and through them. some of my friends say that i'm good at handling relationships. some others think that these ones are plain blind. i don't know where all this goes, but here it is, for the moment. all my wisdom about everything i know about anyone - from any point of view.

						              so who you really are - lies in your  hands. "The doors we open and close each day decide the lives we live."  -Flora Whittemore  we choose which ones of our parallel lives we want to live. our choices make us the people that we are. and what is it really that drives us to our choices? who is it inside us that chooses our choices?  (sigh this is where all the grand old uncles and aunts of the  world of philosophy come in - but here's what i believe)  there are levels and layers and layers in our human consciousness. when we smack our lips in contentment after a particularly yummy meal of pasta - that's physical satisfaction. when we achieve our goal, complete our novel, solve a particularly trying case - it's generally the mental part of us exulting. and when we meet our lovely famlies, and other loved ones, or when we hang out with friends and have a blast of a time, it's the emotional (what, in my world, is called the 'vital') part of us that is happy about it.  smiley says, "No one truly knows who they are. They may have a slight perception. -- When you think you have it, things will change. -- It's just the way of the universe the yin and the yang. -- One big flux of varied possiblities."  the one big flux of  possibilities is us shifting levels.   when someone asks me "who are you" the easiest answer is, i am where my consciousness is. the level at which my consciousness is currently most active in/at/whatever, i am that. if i am exulting in a large pitcher of beer, for that moment, i am first and foremost, a lover of a large pitcher of beer.

						                  keri says:&nbsp;" But I'm probably  not who "THEY" think I am, either."      &nbsp;    this is lesson number two. you are  in all possibility not who THEY think you are, either. well and succintly put!  THEY have a different image of you - different from the one you have of yourself  (which as previously discussed, is probably wrong - incomplete or skewed too).  and it's not just one different image they have of you. there are as many images  as there are THEM. or THEY. each one sees you differently. and for each one you  change.. over the years.      &nbsp;    sigh. the flux thing really gets my  goat!      &nbsp;    so imagine how many of you's there  are in the world. floating around -- waiting for a chance to  materialise.

						                  our main occupation in life is us.  ourselves. me and myself.       &nbsp;    i, you, we see myself as ..  someone.     and i obtusely presume that  everyone else sees me the same way too. i forget that there's many a slip twixt  the cup and the supposition.     first of all, i don't know who i  am. i think i am brilliant, and helpful, but slightly awkward in 'pressure  situations'. my friends seem to feel that i'm rude and blunt enough to give  advice where it's really not needed. sometimes however i am the person they  might turn to when in need. thus proving that the picture i have of me, is  dramatically different from that of what they have of me.       &nbsp;    or you.      &nbsp;    us. anyone. all of us.        &nbsp;    similarly, the image i have of you,  is not the image someone else has of you. you think your wife loves the way you  smell. isn't that why she breathes so deep when you approach her? but, sigh. she  thinks you have bad breath.       &nbsp;    point illustrated.      &nbsp;    you go through your life thinking  you are someone, and one fine day you suddenly realise that the other person,  persons, whole world, has a completely different opinion about you.        &nbsp;    lesson number one: we are probably  not who we think we are. quite surely.      &nbsp;     &nbsp;

      whew! after a long long day of registering at obscure sites, and breaking my head over html code - i am not dumb, diary, but i might be ignorant! - i finally found a thingy to post comments - something not too encumbersome. so now what matters is to hold tight and wait for the comments.. used to post on opendiary.com till tehy went paid. that's what's happening to my life, wherever i go, i hear ppl saying "things just got worse" am i a jinx or something? kidding.

      blast it all.   there's nothing worse than having ppl around throw cold water on ur enthusiasm. b***z to the whole affair. this family thing is terrible to deal with, blows hot then blows cold.. i don't understand it. highly unpredictable. and how the hell am i to learn to live with it. either keep a distance, if they don't want to keep a distance, then elbow space disappears and there's bound to be friction. to avoid friction we have to adjust, change a little bit. in order to adjust/adapt, we have to know the nature of the to-be-adapted-to. which is HIGHLY UNPREDICTABLE AND IT'S PISSING ME OFF!  pah pah pah to the whole thing. they have a problem if i have a boyfriend. i don't have a boyfriend now. just friends with boys. and yes, it must be some fault in me that i prefer hanging out with guys.. not that, to tell the truth, hanging out with girls is also perfectly fine. it's fun.. my D friends are all wonderful fun. but - aaargh! they have a problem, unsaid, unmentioned but terribly obvious in disapproving silences and pursed lips. i hate it. i absolutely hate this. i change and change and change.. but they have to stick to their screwed up ideas... "who will marry a girl who goes camping with a gang of guys?" "who will marry a girl who goes out to drink (!!!) with only guys??" AGH! can i please pull off someone's hair!  somedays i amaze myself with sudden silent outbursts of violent inclinations.. in the head. i never thought of it earlier, but there it is. i suddenly see myself hitting my head on a wall. or there's an urge to smash something... wise me would say it's time to return to the gym. i agree. monday onwards, gym HO! not only will it appease the local powers that be, it will also channelise the 'energy' (#%#@).  ... ... ... ... ... ...  moments of silent contemplation. silent brooding. brooding and sulking.

      let this be about distances.  have always travelled distances, had long-distance friends, parents, homes.. india's a big country. what to italians is a paris or a portugal, is just another city or a state to indians. travelling from the north down south all the way, all the time, across the country, living across, taught me distance learning. sorry. taught me the meaning of long distances. and that long is never so long that it can't be shortened.   now that i am back north, the south is the long distance, the friends are longdistance-madeshort. isn't it all about adjustment, and seeing the important through whatever medium available? sometimes it gets tiresome.

      and no one writes to me.   that, in short, is the tragedy of my life. i need someone to connect to.. and no one replies. it's like calling out in the dark - only, it's not an echo that i am looking for. or is it?  na, echoes... no no. echoes are like you. mirror images of your own self, they feed on your strength. they have your defects, weaknesses. if you stumble, they can't hold you up. they fall too. you get weaker, they get softer.  searching for a complement. have you ever felt the need for the other piece of the puzzle that you might fit into? (as they say in those mushy books).   complements apart, the news of the day is, uh, that the sloth is sleepy. the sloth wishes the sloth could curl up and go to dreamland. no, no, not dreamland again. it's the same old dreams over and over again.   i dream of place called p. a place called p where i leave a part of me everytime i visit it. a place called p where i grew up, to which i belong. belong to the sea there, to the bowl of sky there, to streets that cross at a perpendicular. i belong, or does it belong to me? it calls to me everytime i shut my eyes. the place called p, and boy called a. there's nothing about him. nothing except a sense of being familiar. a comfortable fitting in. there are rough edges, awkward silences. but there are content hours of - nothing. of being comfortable with each other. no, this is not the lifelong complement.. this is a friend. a friend.. this word sucks. comrade in arms, companion - NO. dude? part of the gang? yeah, like a sibling, thick as thieves..  whatever the relationship is, i dream of him. every night. him, his family, of me belonging there, like another sibling in their ensemble. psychotherapists would attribute this to a lack of the family feeling in my own life. that's not the case. that's so seriously not the case. there can't be a better family than mine. but i dream of a. in p. it's as if a subconscious wants to - has decided to stay behind, and live a life there. there's a new adventure everydream. it's like a daily life.  and in the moments when i am alone, when i think back to the dream, of this night, of the night before, of the night before the night before... this world, this world where i type my blog, becomes unreal. dividing lines blur. the other is as real as this is unreal.   maybe i am simply over-reacting.

      as i said, welcome! or should i rather begin with a 'dear diary'? whatever it is, i am glad i am here. i finally realised, instead of writing my heart out in pointlessly long and intimate mails to friends all around the world.. actually trailing behind in every place i live in for a short while ..  it would be better to have it all here.. all the outpoured hearts, heartache, moonlight miracles, shining raindrops, grins, meaningless grins, sudden earthshattering discoveries.. all of it could come here.. consolidated.  point one is, i should learn to not use   points de suspensions  . proper punctuation is the rule of the day.  a short introduction to me. if this is someone else reading this, it's essential. if it's no one reading this, it's essential for my diary to know who i am. i am someone who dislikes bad spellings (unless they are intentional) dislikes bad punctuation. an inclination for languages and their structure that borders on insanity - not mine - i drive the others nuts with this behaviour (oh, i use british spellings). i grew up in a hostel - with the constant telephonic companionship of my parents and their 'guidance'. now that i am back home, to a town without friends - a town to which i used to return only for a month in a year, for 11 years of my life - now begin my grievances. the foremost being - loneliness. others are to be listed in the forthcoming blogs will be about conflicts with parents, changing values, changed values, lack of values, inclinations, baseless wondering, musings - stuff that makes up the journals of just about everyone else too. i guess that's but natural.  the essential points: 22 (as of now), female ;) india. someone has to tell me if i would have been the same had i been anywhere else. no boyfriend at this point in time. lots and lots of guy friends - but more about them later.  all the details shall slowly unfurl.

      cold feet cold feet cold feet..  i leave tmrw, and i'm feeling the empty feeling in the pit of the tummy.. jitters. - shal be back in a week.. and hope to god new things would've come up by then. i wonder why it is that i need to live off novelty; something new in my life? why do i getbored with everything after a while like it were an old toy? it's a dangerous thing, this fickle temperament. yes.. fickle. that's what everyone says. all the handwriting pundits, the long horoscopes (i must sure sound paranoid and an astrology - supranatural fan). the word fickle used to keep popping up - and all the while i thought it meant (find me a decent version of slut?) sigh yes. fickle's the word of the day. it's dangerous, and it wrecks havoc in life, relationships, career? - since when did i begin to bother? it's the mark of a petty mind that refuses to delve into anything fully. anything that requires concentration, dedication, single minded hard work.. it shies away from serious words. sigh.. i can't pinpoint a single time when i have given myself fully to anything - for a period longer than a month (even a relationship - something had to happen  for me to stay). i am beginning to look awful to myself. and this was supposed to a be support and strength gathering blog. terrible. there's no telling what introspective writing can uncover to you eh?  weeellll i look like i am changing in some aspects. i mean, for the new home-circumstances, it took me about 2 months and another of holiday away from home, to begin to adjust and to become the 'good girl' - patient, sharing work, un-distracted, participating in the work at the office.. hmm maybe even the 'fickle' part might change. but i fear it won't be very soon. i should never allow it to ruin my married life tho (HA HA! LOOK AT URSELF! AT LEAST GET MARRIED BEFORE YOU TALK OF ALL THIS). but i AM scared it might :(  yesterday there was mention of U. how can one take it lightly? how do i pretend i didn't hear and that it doesn't matter to me? of course it's weird what i am doing. someone i have never met? attribute qualities and an image to him based on what my parents told me about him.. and the sending-vibes part.  i thought i was dumb. now i know for sure. what makes me surer is the crystal clear certitude that i will not stop the sending-vibe - even in spite of this blog telling me i am dumb.  all you librans out there, watch out! it could happen to you too!  ah yes, and we do not stop hoping that something new would have been fixed by the time we retunr next week.

      restless. maybe it's all because i do nothing all day. a few moments of constructive suggestions.. they're good. but i guess the "idle mind=devil's workshop" rings true in my case. mind runs in pathetic circles all day long picking at events or conversations of the previous day.  this kind of lethargic restlessness is pretty contradictory. fruitless. someone suggested i should run. or any other equivalent.

      wrote this poem a long time back.. hmm not so long. thought i could keep it here (for lack of better content?!) .. pretty pathetic:  roses for the dead regrets for the living.  you feel nought but avoid. on a day of no surprises you turn my life around.  roses for the dead... 'don't you think it is a little too windy?' casaurinas sighing in the breeze like whispers from the past. a forbidden memory of salt spray on my lips insides burning with passion unspent; bottled up feelings make my hands tremble. gauche in front of you - almost forgotten -  a stranger with a myriad secrets; magnetism that still holds our fingertips together?  my hand throbs with pain as i wipe the memory off my brow.

      feeling.. funnily.. feminine.  no, there's no doubt abt my gender whatsoever, and i have no funny otherfeelings. but all of a sudden i feel feminine..  it's taken me loads of time to figure out where this feeling comes from.. there are some possibilities.  a) extra attention from boston - or providence or wherever. b) monthly cycle.. or the blasted tide even tho i am far from any large water body. c) am i cooking and associating it with being feminine? urgh d) new hormones YAY! or maybe now my Body Structure's changed ;) e) anticipation of meeting my friends.. tho' that should only make me feel all excited and bubbly.. femnine doesn't fit.   just feel as if i am bursting with the about-to-get-married feritility hormone. URGH! URGH A MILLION TIMES.  when i started writing, the feminine feeling wasn't about fertility. it was about feeling beautiful, soft, utterly feminine. sigh.. all my dirty secrets in writing!

      finally packed up n sent the lot of shirts i made. that's one responsibility that's somewhat done, carried out reasonably well. i would give myself 6.5 for that.  i was feeling good about something today, i can't really figure out what it is. it's there, bubbling right under the surface. it's the surprise party complex feeling. something's going to happen. . the i-am-getting-a-mail feeling when you check ur mail a trillion time for those 5 odd kb's *sigh* and what's worse is that no one even writes to me.. maybe it's coz i too have stopped writing.. largely. pshah! --- sneaky lil good feeling. some concentrate of some optimism sitting there.. sigh.. right under the skin!  AH! I FIGURED IT OUT! at least 50% of it is caused by the lunch i made! yes my dear i cooked! ha ha! good yummy stuff.. yesterday and today, and salads and all. good .. learning stuff... but the sneaky feeling goes beyond this. maybe it's got something to do with the program which is getting finalised.. will never get finalised. i don't think project bluestars' ever going to work out. some talk in the air. and some more talk and then some more. god alone knows whats in the books.  sigh!

       random - on the verge of insane    scared myself out of my wits today when one of the meandering thought-tag games led me to 30 yrs from now.  the space under the stairs looks beautiful. that's coz mom takes care o it. what if it becomes dirty n messy n more like a store=that shouldn't happen here, the upstairs godown could become a store=only if the printer leaves, the workshop shifts or shus down=only if the person - mom - is not there. aaaaagh! ouch. that hurt.  but 40 yrs from now... i can't beleive i saw it happen.  as an aside, i dreamt i was in srinagar! one of those pretty houses being built by the lake had one interestin bougainvillea. it was so sensitive, it retreated, disappeared at human touch. i don't know what made me think it was beautiful - it was pretty plasticky to look at. the 2 ragamuffins came to take me out.. illegally. went.. dreamt i had a drink in my hand, was swirling it, sipping it - when i woke up with a start. and yes, i felt the high!  funny.  diet has gone to hell. in spite of all the excercise i have puton weight :(

        stupid tests   your subconscious mind is most preoccupied with issues around your love life   On a conscious level, you might already be aware that something is troubling you, or eating up a lot of time when it comes to your love life. But it's also possible that thoughts and feelings about your romantic life have been preoccupying your subconscious mind — leaving you with nothing more than a general sense that things just don't feel 100% right in your life though you can't quite figure out why.  You may feel your love life is unfulfilling and needs a jumpstart. You might be going through a lot of changes in your love life that you find emotionally draining. You might simply spend a lot of time thinking about romantic relationships. Or maybe you're so frustrated with your situation that you avoid the topic all together.  Whichever feelings hold true, your test results indicate that right now, your subconscious mind is working overtime to resolve the issues confronting you in this area of your life — even if you don't feel aware of it.   -------------- very very stoopid :(

           somethings have happened. sigh one .. which is wonderful.. i really really believe in putting all the good news first. its' a tendency absolutely unique to the optimist.  a long lost song discovered itself to me. *hits her head on the wall* uncovered itself to me.. translation: i finally found an mp3 of a long lost song. escape club: i'll be there. corny and sentimental, it helped me through college and other growing years. two.. and all the other numbers. i uncovered a chain of thought. bitterness against prescribed change=don't want to change coz i am happy the way i am=not happy but i believe in individualism no matter how negative=not really individual, just being distinct from the image of me as i should be=a revulsion for the image because it makes me have to change=and i don't want to change because i am lazy?=but why change? sigh back to sequare one. and i thought i had i all worked out. at least so it seemed in my head. put on paper (ok put in html) it doesn't seem to work out in the same equation.  yes, a silent chamber that remembers itself. and a horizon that waits to be scanned, all along, flat and wide... expanse of ever changing hues.

      someone reminded me that i should write. sigh.   laziness has settled in every bloody pore. another list is dying to come out.. list of things i should do. including the projects i thought i would get cracking on. sigh! sigh sigh sigh. there's this thing that's coming up.. a 'job' ?? and i don't even know why i am going towards it. what do i want from it? like everything else, this too is  happening   to me. there was meditation in the morning. sat for half an hour. all my mind did was jump from one thing to another. even if i wanted to concentrate -- lazy again!  there is only one thing i concentrate on .. it is far from now, it is probably improbable. but is it true, if i think, wish imagine, picture something hard enough.. (it's been more than just a few months now) it wil come true? or is this imagining yet another stupid thing i am doing :(  things that remember themselves...  like the salt spray of the sea a phrase of music that haunts irrelevant yellow wall. a silent chamber  that remembers itself  i live the life of a letharge. does that word even exist? stuck to this chair and this screen.. meaningless notes in the background, sharing myself (pseudo) with ppl i have never met.. but know.. sigh. what a stupid life.

      from a mail.. of course!  watched dreaming of joseph lees. hmm, it's a purely girl-oriented movie. for once it was a sensitive girl, underplayed.. slightly shrill at times tho :( .. there was something terribly sensitive abt the movie..  she was basically in loooove with this cousin of hers.. u have to watch it. it's slow. but u have to watch it. a simple thing like 'he was in her thoughts most of the time' they dealt with it delicately.. hmm iguess i am just repeating myself. and of course there was this chap (GOD KNOWS why she even went out with him-like some last resort) who went mad for her, without her.. so she basically chose him over the cousin - who also loved her.. - in the end like some goddamn responsibility to herself - like some bloody obligation. the movie didn't preach. the end was halfsaidunsaid. i think she chose the madman in the end n not the cousin.. but i want to beleive it was the cousin.. good. i am glad the end was halfsaidunsaid.  then there was this younger sister of the lead (eva). silent grinner, giggling away with her sister.. she sort of knew all of the secrets (tho HOW it beats me!).. she had this amazing activity-catharsis-thinkingoutaloud. bouncing 2 balls on the wall she'd repeat some stupid ditty she'd make up based on the current events: like: my sister eva, she has a feva, was kissed by harry now he'll have to marry her.. some stuff like that.. mumbled under her breath.. excellent tool. like when she was upset, she couldn't make up a ditty. and she had this almost-telepathic connection with her sister. i liked the movie, in short. ah well. it got horrid reviews.. six years in the making!!  urlLink    urlLink

      finally discovered something..  i used to think i was a wonderfully unique person coz i could 'decide' to not be attatched to blah blah.. and presto, so n so was out of my life. of course the out of sight-out of mind phenomenon used to conveniently dole me out on such occasions. well.. here's the terrible discovery, it's not detachment, it's a kind of selfishness. i , me , myself, am at the centre of my own univ. of course, that's how it should be for everyone else too.. after all, i should worry abt my own troubles.. and if i do worry abt someone else's then that person means something to me.. that's how it generally is...  and so, class, we conclude that the 'me' factor in all equations is the central and most crucial element, without which the equation would have absolutley no relevance in the / my / imemyself world.. which is - watson! - the only world imemyself know.  among other things, i bought myself a copy of catch 22.. to read for the millionth time.  O well what the hell!!  heh! one of my nicest-loved lines.

      nothing deep, nothing philosophical - nor pseudo philo' to write today. was a little tired after that dinner.  this is the millionth dinner we've just hosted. for those not in the know, i live with mom dad and grandpa, and inspite of our saying we are not social we know practically everyone there is to know in this tiny town. and we have to invite them all for dinner or something this month. i must have done the dinner thing .. have i already said it?... a million times. lay the table, yellow or blue? make the salad. now i have graduated to making the 'bhalla's.. that's something we have with curd/yogurt. this girl's growing up and learning stuff now. there's no grumbling either, nor any losing of temper. that's good that's good. but one more dinner and i'll throw in the towel. or the napkin, or the serviette or whatever comes handy. there's a dinner in september. a major thing end sept.. am so not looking forward to it. ah but the cousins will be here.. from EVERYwhere... !! okok.  mom didn't like me msging A. now that's weird. she has problems with him too.. ah but she doesn't understand the rel. now that i have done it all, and seen it all (almost, haven't i) maybe now i am wise enuf to keep my relationships under control. i mean, after J. there's  really been nothing else.. lemme see. PK yes. but very short, and he was the last thing in the line anyway. next up is.. ahh but that i won't say.. and the preparation begins tomorrow.  o my blogness. if someone reads this blog they won't be able to make head or tail of it! :))  anywayz. that's about it. i guess i am missing my friends a little less. been thinking abt the REAL reason i wanted to go to pdy. the real attraction to that place. it's probably the fact that i am an individual there without the shadow of the Familee,.. and i tremble at the thought of A Familee i might 'marry' into. twill be like chiki.  ah well. let the horror come when it does.

      finally get some time to myself. of course, there's always something lurkin behind me, behind my back, in the back of my head. i never feel on my own. there's some expectation, some guilt for not having lived up to the expectation and then lots of disgust at self, followed by over eating like some kind of wilful punishment, not only on myself but on the p's too because it's the last thing they want..  twisted.. gollum like twisted.  sigh. i should stop sitting at my table like a sloth. however i might dislike it, working in the morning did help. something productive made me feel better. let there be a target of a certain amnt.. let there be a schedule.. and things will automatically improve. the gym's beginning on monday. that should be healthy.   now things to do include the paper bags.. i have to get cracking on them. someone please help! i don't want to be so alone. i know i am not alone.. but then.  that longing for a complement. back to scratch. longing for what you don't have. longing for what i don't have.  longing for who i don't know. longing for someone i don't even know.. and i want to know the way he breathes. it's like i know already everything abt him.. constructed in my head. completely constructed in my head.. and yet there's supposed to be full space for a new person to come along and enter my life, to enter my life with his whole family and his own whole life: friends, job, aspiration, weakness, everything. and when is it even going to happen? i am tired of waiting holding my breath.  the answer' right here i guess. the day i can prove to myself that i can work, that i can handle, all this. this is my challenge (this is my december) and no one else has to face it the way i have to.

       extracts from an enlightened mail to Ab.   you know, when we get to know people, we see one aspect of them. the A u know, or the jag or the gaw you know, is not exactly the same person that the other people around him think he is.  it's like this: the ab ur mom knows, is not the ab i know, is not the ab jag knows, is not the ab gaw knows and so on. my point is that the way u know me, the image you have of me, is not the one others have of me. it's understandable if you get surprised by something u just got to know, but you should remember that there's loads of aspects of every person.  sometimes it's weird, coz we are so busy being the son, the daughter, the friend, the sister, the brother, that we forget who we are. sigh.. but then there's the converse: what we are when we are with others defines who we are, inside. isn't that true too?   [...]i just wanted you to know that i am not only the A u know. and the same holds true for all the people you know. the same holds true for you vis a vis all the people who know you. and the fact that i am a nice person when with you is a compliment to you coz u bring out some of the best in me :)   [...]this happy feeling u n i discuss, after a day of good studying or a day of good designing, [...]- this happy feeling gives a certain confidence u can't get from anywhere else. this happy feeling changes many attitudes, helps you grow.   this happy feeling is The Happy Feeling the whole goddamn world is looking for. and all they manage to do is chase money. coz they think that that's the thing that gives THF. sigh. the poor ignoramuses. or ignoramii... (cactus - cactii; ignoramus - ignoramii?) [...... and so on]   the real concept   well the many personalities concept described above is a pet one. i got it from uno, nessuno, centomila by pirandello. (story behind the book is another post!) it's about genge, who suddenly discovers that the way he is perceived by his wife, is drastically different from the way he sees himself. (it all began with a pimple in the nose, sigh!) which leads him to discover that there are a million genge's: all images of him, but pretty unrecognizable by him, created by the people around him, based on the way they see him. imagine, everyone thinks you are someone else! and who do you think you are? (why else do you think i keep taking those dumb personality quizzes!) and how do i find out the truth unless it is through the other people around me. someone used to tell me that the people around me are but mirrors of myself. that i can recognise a certain trait in someone only because some of it, however miniscule, is there in me too. how true is that?  and damn, this is just the beginning.

        day four   well it's day four. and last day.. in a couple of hours mom n dad will be back - from a semi honeymoon holiday! (ha ha!) to srinagar - which they could make coz i said i'd take care of the work. so ... conclusions.. anyway! with their return begins a mad week of -- madness. the PARTY is this saturday. i have no idea what i am going to wear. i have no idea what my responsibilities are. i have no idea of what all is left to do. that apart, the amount of work pending at the workshop is bordering on insane. don't know how mom'll handle that.  well. day four. woke up late. hmm not so late, woke up at eight. K called up so i spoke to her about "how to live life" and gave her loads of pep talk. by the time i got out of bed it was past 9 15. soul session came n went. had breakfast (alone, but for the last time) with the newspaper. by the time i wound things up, did the laundry, it was time to get dressed, time for the movie! went out today, first time since i've shifted back to this morose moronic town, with a semi-friend. (she works with us). watched  urlLink a movie  about a mentally challenged boy finding an alien who heals his brain.. blah blah typical hindi film melodrama. but somethings were a little more tolerable in the movie... chuck it.  more later. tata.

       day three   that's right, day three. i forgot to write day two as a separate entry. so the words "day two" that would have been typed as the heading for the entry that never was (distinct) got cheated of their right, cheated of their  raison-d'etre .   one would be justified in thinking that that's unreasonable reasoning - coz the "day two" that was to be written as a heading never was, never came into existence - for the simple reason that the entry itself didn't manifest. so the "day two" in this entry that's claiming insurance for having been cheated is, in reality, an impersonator.  arrest him !  weeeell, getting down to the basics, day three was pretty much like day two. a little better because it looked like some of the work was actually done. there's nothing else really to say... wait!  now this is something i did today. it's the beginning of a tablecloth and napkin set to match a dinner set i'd got for mom last year. it never got used (the dinner set) coz nothing ever matched. but now, let's hope this works out!      another test  that's another test result, and for once it might be close to correct:   Romantic Realist   Love over money is a no-brainer for you because you're a Romantic Realist. But no matter how smitten you are, you know love doesn't pay the bills.   Your monthly budget, diversified portfolio, and penchant for bargains may sound predictable, but it doesn't mean you're not afraid to take a risk every now and then. Whether it's your new leather pants or that brooding stranger in the corner, you are entitled to your treats. But for you, true love is a long-term investment that has nothing to do with the trust funds and everything to do with trust.   other stuff  it's funny how easily you get used to attention. attention being showered on you. one day of lots of phone calls, and now i find myself carrying my phone around like a lifeline, and checking it every 10 mins for missed calls.   what did i do the rest of the day? i made no notes. that's what i did.  it's saturday night. all over the world people are freshening up at this time (9pm) and stepping out with their friends for a jollygoodtime. sigh.  i can't find music i really want to listen to. tried pink floyd, sister hazel, don't want to venture towards tracy chapman, tired of david gray, enya puts me to sleep these days. finally settled on the misc. folder. it's not fair. i want someone to talk to. i want someone who'll sit with me and watch a movie without saying a word and then roll off with silent laughter for no reason at all. i want to step out of this increbile unrecognizable person i seem to have become. the first of the problems is that i don't know what i was. and i don't know into what i will be stepping when i do step out.   why oh why couldn't They have made things a little easier. this phase of wondering what comes next is terrible. it wearies the soul. or so they say! (or so i say, who cares about what they say). going off to watch crappy tv. somebody make my day puhleeeeeeeeze! :(

      i write coz it keeps me company. and i dread the day someone'll make me read what i have been writing. especially of late, it's mindless drivel. recounting moment to moment events with no particular interest. (same old flow:A+ content:F)   paranoia  ( i am amazed that all i can write about is my family) be it a two day journey in a train that we've all done a zillion times together, or a trip my parents are taking as a work-cum-pleasure break. i get paranoid when they travel.    bouton d'amour    i am currently enjoying a huge overdose of affection and attention from my buddy (pronounced: friends since 11, constantly on the verge of a crush - either side, both sides) i have been told that all this adds colour to the cheeks! quite like the classic joke: mom: eat your salad dear, it will give colour to your cheeks. girl: but i don't waawnt green cheeks *sulk sulk indignantly* ha ha! i have written reams about him, to him, so right now i am quite out of words when it comes to him.   foodie  pigged on kulcha chana as promised earlier, for lunch. it was more amazing than i thought it would have been! *twinkle*   spilling my guts heart whatever all over my blog  i am working on figuring myself out. i am. following my conversation (a pretty long one!) i realised a realisation that's been sittingonmyhead. i can't recognise myself anymore. he says it's change. if this is change, then what was i before. sigh, i thought that these phases of figuringout happened only to teenagers. i can't believe (why do i always type it beleive?!!) that i am the same person who, a year ago, couldn't have imagined working in my mom's place, and sending her on a holiday. i could have never imagined myself being this good girl, who cooks entire dinners (simple though they maybe) for family friends and "why don't you join us" dinners. i guess i had always told myself that i could do it, if i wanted to. but, the truth is, that i am dong it. and there is nothing else i want to do. not because this is what i want to do, but because this is there to do and i don't have a strong urge to do anything else.  does this say that i am a passive person? *bites her lip anxiously* that's the kind i never wanted to be. tell me one project anyproject that i took up and saw it through on my own, a successful one. none. hmph. i should have been like my cousins : one with all that drive and hard work cooling his ass off in paris. the other with more than a couple of master's degrees under her belt.... she has a clear idea of what she wants to do.  ambition, that's what i lack. or is it, ambition of material things?  i wonder.  i have a goal. not a goal. it's a wish, and something i am working towards in my own way. why do i have to be like the others? my GoalWish is an intricately constructed castle in ze cloudz. sigh. with a prinz in de cloudz (grr) it hardly HARDLY sounds intelligent, leave alone mature.   teachers n frnds have told me to drop the lil' girl act. daddy's daughter. what am i without it?? don't know, don't know.    why a girl writes  the allan & barbara pease series (the men are from mars, women from venus list of books) has this strongly supported theory that women think out aloud. at the end of the day, a man can't bear to listen to a woman's 'nagging' coz he feels he is being expected to solve all her problems (while she's just sorting stuff out for herself with him as a sounding board).  lookitme, i got no man, but i got a blog!  special thanks to  urlLink gurg  for sparking off the why we/i write lead.

       urlLink the best reasons for writing : THE ELEMENTAL  The ancient alchemists sought to change base metals into gold, explain  life, and discover the secrets of immortality. Alchemists worked with  one foot planted in science and the other in the quasi-religious.  This sounds suspiciously like writing. Substitute "writers" for  "alchemists" and "words" for "metals," and I'd say you have a pretty  fair description of what we try to accomplish and how we go about it. We  try to convert base words into literary gold. We try to explain the  world, communicate themes and philosophies, connect on a visceral level.  And what is a published work but a slice of immortality? To work toward  a complete, effective piece, we combine cold, technical aspects with  sizzling spiritualness in the correct proportion. The writer who  concentrates only on grammar, syntax, and precise definition will  produce work that is sterile, soulless. Conversely, the writer who's all  fervor with no structure produces work that rivals the forbidden speech  of mad prophets.  So where does one start? Like the alchemists of old, we begin with the  elemental: we write. This may sound hackneyed and obvious, but it takes  an existential leap of faith before we can honestly embrace this  directive as truth. Of all the writing advice I have ever received or  imparted, this is the purest. What makes us writers is WRITING. Not  thinking about it. Not reading about it. Not fantasizing about it. We  need to sit down, put pen to paper (or fingers to keys), and just write.  Free write. Journal. Compose a story. Create a novel. Write. This is the  only way we will learn, the only way we will improve.   By writing, we get a feel for language. We begin to develop an ear for  what sounds "correct." When we write, we give ourselves the opportunity  to apply concepts learned from workshops, seminars, books, columns, and  coffee-fueled brainstorming sessions. The more we write, the more  confidence we gain. With confidence comes experimentation, which leads  to discovery.  Will we create gold every time we set out? No. Should we strive to  create gold each time? Of course. The act of writing is wonderful and  frustrating, transcendent and mundane, and it is ours to explore.  But for the moment, remember the elemental: we cannot create if we don't  begin.  Now go scribble something.   John Caruso john@coffeehouseforwriters.com

        home alone ctd    well that was half the night. what can i say about the rest of it apart from the fact that i wish i could poison theneighbours' dog. i adore dogs, don't get me wrong, but this one?! i only feel bad for it and guess mine would only be a good deed coz i'd be putting it out of its misery. it goes thus: small house, NO garden, and BIG BIG dog in stupid weather. unhealthy atmosphere and no love in that house. the poor thing remains chained all day on the terrace! beleive me! isn't his fault if he barks his heart out all night. it's my ill luck that my windows are on level with the poor fellow's terrace. silent neighbourhood's shaken with his barking. and i poor girl can't sleep all night! i hate this cycle. those sardars are really going to get a piece of my mind today.  well, last night was quite ok, after i complained for 15 straight mins to my bro on the phone about the dog, while he was suggesting ways i could get rid of the dog or the neighbours, i finally slept at 12. woke up fresh as dew in ze morning, like the good girl i am! no trouble with the car today, drove to and back hassle free .. even parking the car was quite a breeze! did other banal things like the washing and breakfast. bfst wasn't so bad today. i had the newspaper, and halfway through i came upstairs to sit at the pc with my coffee. had mah frnds online u see! that is sure a lovely thing. all the loneliness (all the possible loneliness) says a quick byebye the moment i talk to em! been working, organising work. felt a little more confident today and things were a bit better than yesterday because i could see that the embroidery was progressing.  lunch time now, and boy, am i famished! gonna pig on  kulcha chana . for those who don't know what it is, you're missing out one something YUMMY!

       day 1  day one of home alone.  it started on a bad note coz i couldn't even reverse the car out of the house. the gates at a terrible angle, and then there's a slope, and there are loads of cars parked outside. it's a driving test in itself. got to the gym late, but managed my hour of jumping n all that sweat! i didn't really plan to park the car back in, i thought i could have asked cousins next door to do the dirty work but sk (the cook) was waiting with the gate open (well, he was chatting with gardner! n opened the gates when he saw the car) and convinced me that i should put the car in. with a little bit of guidance, i actually managed it! yippe aaii yay! so now folks, i am pretty qualified eh! - breakfast alone was pathetic. i missed mom n dad and the stuff that i eat frm their plates. eating all from my own was no fun at all :( hmm.. working in mama's place. now that was a new experience. worked a little harder. my comments were a little more important (and intelligent) than usual. the workers knew that i was the last authority, on any design, colour, cut.. so felt somewhat kingly! heh heh! got a few orders for new things. it was good. the printer's hand slipped n he misprinted something. i spoke to him and added another line to the whole thing. it was pretty good solution providing! :D that's one thing ... i get 7 for that! sigh, it's only 930. more later. at night. tata diary

       today - special?    today was supposed to be the special day. 22nd sept has been like a silent b'day for me, for over 7 years. for various reasons.. every year, since '96 something special would happen today. something that'd make me stop and think, and then know that somewhere i had changed, grown, gotten an opportunity that changed something inside of me. something for the better. positive.  and today i forgot all about it. 22nd september is the day of special connecting with friends, with people who give me a new insight into my life. something special happens today. and i should respect this day.   and all i have done today is do stupid quizzes, work a little bit.. and hmm .. nothing. sigh, i haven't even become a couch potato, just a letharge vegetatin in my own words at my own pc..  maybe tomorrow will be better.

       what's in a name?   Brief Analysis: Your name creates a very versatile and creative nature. You are quick-minded and have the freedom of expression to mix easily with people. Because your feelings and desires are so changeable, you are never satisfied with conditions as they are. You have many ideas, plans, and ambitions, but too often they are for an easy way out of a difficulty or an easy way of making money. You seek change in order to have the opportunity for travel, new experiences, and new friends and associates. You find it difficult to systematize your efforts and to fulfil your obligations and plans as you are not inclined to apply yourself consistently to a job to reach your goals. Although you appear positive, you inwardly lack self-confidence and will-power. This name has caused you to feel unsettled emotionally and mentally, being too easily influenced through your emotional nature and by other people. The name makes it difficult for you to view life realistically, to be honest with yourself and with others. Instead, you live in your desires, longing for conditions and people to be as you would like them to be.    zap me!      Hindi or Navejo  urlLink What Language Are You?

      sigh. yet another grumbly self pitying log. when will it ever run out of steam and give way to something else? it is one of those timeless moments again, when it doesn't matter if it's midnight, 3 in the morning or 5 in the afternoon. what matters is that you are alone, with your thoughts .. when it could be any other time, and it wouldn't matter. the identity of this moment is not relative to where the moment is, or when it is. its identity, for once, depends only upon what it makes of itself. most of us live relative lives. relative to the family, relative to the friends who gather through various circumstances. we live like a daughter, sister, friend, girlfriend, wife mother (and etc for the men).  it is this that suffocates some people. they have something that pushes them into a world where they aren't 'related' to anything. where they can create their own identity. yet i feel that there are only a few who have the strength to choose this life for themselves consciously. for most others it is an escape from present circumstances: family pressure, peer pressure, society. ambition would cause people to leave behind the 'related' world. how many actually leave everything, KNOWING that they are leaving everything, and they leave it, because they have to leave it, not because something else calls and they can't take everything else along?   news:  given it a new look. pretty cool eh! wonder how to change the tranquility on top to nigglin doubts...    later:  it didn't work. a whole night of fiddling with html and all that, it looks fine in the preview, but not when i access it directly, so what's the point :(

          random ramblings   there is no real time when i actually focus on what i am, what i want. each moment of the day, i mould myself to the present 'mood' 'aspect'. you could call it fluid, you could call it fickle. it turns up again.   "forever trust in who we are, and nothing else matters". i want that kind of confidence and drive. not to rely on others, not to depend, or need or want. to steer my life the way i want. people talk of girls studying - and studying, and being brilliant - then the girls get married and have housemaids at their beck and call all day. it's not that anyone, leave aside 'anyone', it's not even as if i myself deny the luxury of that life. but one must give it up to live life by one's own rules. by my own rules. to step out of this protective cocoon.    i have lost track of any - if any - beautiful thing i ever wrote. sometimes i think i should dig up old drawers for my school and college essays. but then there's something that says, why should i recycle? if i could write then, why not now? WHY NOT NOW? bawl!   how does one go about writing a piece of good writing? 1 - WANT to write 2 - HAVE something to write about 3 - WRITE about it ach! non posso nemmeno scrivere delle *istruzione. ACH! i can't even write instructions, leave alone writing that line in italian without a dictionary.   it is as i feared.  i have become a vege table .

      now that it's really working - after some hard work - i am at a loss to write. of course, writing about being at a loss is enough not to be at a loss - coz i am writing, aren't i? but it's like one of those sad italian essays that had to be churned up in a minute for a last moment assignment - flowy language A+; content F.  this  urlLink gurg's  got it all worked out. he notes down passing thoughts and works on them, picks topics from everydaylife to make a blog out of it. i have a lot to learn.  - visited srinagar in june and lived in a houseboat for a week. it was right out of an ancient  shehzaadaa - begum  era.  urlLink this is about the Seine  in another corner of the world.. but it feels the same.  i vow to think and write tomorrow.

      something's wrong with this thing.. i can't view my own blog :( and that was one of my most repeated activities of the day ha ha! it was like leafing through a diary.. reading re-reading.. and then getting disgusted. interesting thing is, i have a diary from my 3rd yr at college. it was sposed to document work to be done, and work that was done in the classes each day. the interesting discussions were (supposed to be) mentioned and personal point of view noted.. it's there only in a couple of areas.. when i was super-enthusiastic! then it also documents special days and events (when i fell ill.. and when .. yeah.. special things happened! ha ha!) good quotes. dry flowers. hmm quite a scrap book!  i always wanted to start another one, but i guess this blog is as close as it gets..   been talking about the party of late. planning it. a hundred ppl! garden party. we spoke to the ppl who were to do the catering today. hmm things are moving. among the things to be planned is "outfits for mom n me" - hilarious! but yeah.. mine's pretty much decided. duh - dumb meandering. dumb talk.  downloaded some radiohead. is pretty interesting. they have a very pleasant sound..   more later.

      hah! funny thing is, i started the blog in july, and look! it's already september, and i am still writing! that's an achievement for sure!   i think i am about the join the we-dig-pink-floyd/pink-floyd-is-god gang. dug most of the albums out of some remote corner. they were part of my bro's collection. i never really enjoyed that music. tho now that i listen to it, it's a league apart from the creeds n the linkin parks. david gray's fine. but this somehow fulfills a need i'd been experiencing - even tried - blasphemy - reverting to pop. but AGH! thankfully found this.  radiohead's cool. downloading some of their music.   was looking for some oriental motifs to begin the oriental embroidery range. wonder where to look for inspiration. sigh. am too too lazy to draw. all i do these days is trace stuff from here and there. i can't really get down to making a good motif. when will i snap out of this. after lunch we vow to begin working on the chinese thing. another of the tiny responsibilities alongwith its tiny deadline's come up. end of next week wants a lot of printed suits. hmm.. and young designs. what no one realises is that what i do is nothing more than the stereotype mix n match. there has been no really innovative design by me. nothing exciting. i thought was i was doing was good, but when i saw the records of stuff that had been made previously i seriously flipped. it's pretty sad eh? someone who's done all the fancy art n fashion things can't do a thing beyond stereotype. it's actually a little difficult to measure up to mom's work. but.. is it mom's work that i have to measure up to? or is it an image of me, expectations set up by (whom?) about my capacities. everyone says stuff like (including a pandit who's only seen my horoscope and knows nothing abt me!!!!) even if she puts in 2% of her full capacity into her work/life, she will get returns that are hundredfold in measure. sigh! what am i doing? should i think about working out of town? but why can't i stay here? aaargh!  wore an old-ish t-shirt. the mirror says it is slightly looser now. isn't that something to celebrate! oh, and ah, a correction: it wasn't the wedding anniv celebration that dad was refering to, it was a b'day party for g'dad. now.. what should i make of that!!?? - confused!

        typeyourname   heh heh, that's my new msn id.. or rather display name.  there was a discussion over my possible sun sign in the gym today. at least have begun to talk to people there. never has there been a place or situation where i have been considered an introvert.. yet here..  funny thing was, trying to strike up a friendship with one of the girls.. (now for some clarification 1) i am a girl. 2) straight. no no no lesbian tendencies. 3) no friends in this lousy city, and no chance to make any - no matter how much everyone says that i have to go out and make some. because my honeys and my bunnys  there is no out!  )  she looked approximately my age.. or younger. bolt from the blue when she said she was married. .. and worse.. has a boy! AAAGH! what happened to all young girls.. with whom can i even ever go to watch a movie??? somebody?? anybody??  sigh. me the big sympathy extractor.. extracting it from myself! ;)  dad wants me to diet.. think about this.. complete emotional blackmail.. "don't you think it would be lovely.. on our wedding anniversary we're planning to throw a party... if you could go on a diet or something!" i mean whatthehell! whatthehell this is not fair so not fair so not fair. and now i know i will make some effort if not a lot. i don't WANT to make loads of effort.  first it was - if u'r fat no one'll want to marry you. (how cheap does that sound tell me!) and now it's - for our wedding anniversary.. imagine how happy it will make us.. and you too. yeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaargh! *pulls her hair out in despair*  gimme a break.. gimme some credit! i have changed. now i participate at work. i take responisbility for stuff. hell i even managed a whole dinner when some guests were over. mom didn't even know what the menu was! bawl!  this is not the end of the issue. i know it's not. it's going to come back.. every fucking day.

      if anyone's ever read linda goodman, which to tell the truth is dumb, but then that's not what this post's about.. or is it? well if anyone's read her, i'd suggest she use my previous post as a description for the 'balancing act' of the libran.  i suck :(  o which reminds me, one of the hoardings in mbai read "they suck we rock" i died when i saw that it was a hoarding of the govt, by the govt - anti terrorism. seriously. i died. - the autopsy didn't say if it was shame or delirium caused by laughing.

        back after a week    the 'week where things were supposed to change' has come to an end. as an immediate after effect, i was dumbstruck. just dumb, and struck by some choices i'd have to make pretty soon. i used to think that life was a cake (what about the calories??!!  one wrong thing is that i can't see myself doing it. while parts of me are saying "things don't come out of the blue. the opportunity's given to me because i can do it, and because it's good for me" a good part of me says "this isn't me this isn't me this isn't me"... - on further introspection one can safely deduce that the second part is un-plastic, inflexible matter that refuses to change/grow/improve.  but, sigh, i am not responsible - DAMMIT i don't want to be responsible.. -- but i guess we can make of our lives what we choose to.. so i shall see what i want to choose when i begin this new thing.     somefin else   when i wrote this, it was all crystal clear.. and nothing was redundant:  a more poignant blue stillness of an afternoon reigns over a frame - lived over and again a clip that is a frame of a more poignant blue dancing over burning golds.  picture perfect frame burnt into the memory blazoned by an authority that claims you as its own. there is no choice,  there is no turn to take, only a bend. only a bend that i must follow...  and beyond?  i give myself up to walk into the frame - inside the frame like into a still with a blurring sight - blurred with my own uncertainty while a more poignant blue watches over me with the calm strength of a dancing stillness.  golds and greens simmering in a haze of things to come,  a blue that is only what it was, and i am no more.     neccesaire et suffisante   then there's this concept that describes exactly how i want to be with - someone who's going to be with me all my life, with whom i am going to be all my life: this is the one supreme condition... that he and i be necessaire et suffisante (like some blasted propriete... or even cliched pieces of a jigsaw puzzle) for our existence - in order for us to live.

      now  urlLink this  is the kind of stuff i live for...  a palindrome is a word that reads the same forward and back (malayalam - south indian lingo)  . a palindromic pharse (madam, i'm adam) is fun. fun also is:  "“Signa te signa. Temere me tangis et angis. / Roma tibi subito motibus ibit amor”, each half of which is cancrine (It was supposedly said by the Devil to St Martin, who had changed him into a donkey and ridden him to Rome. In translation: “Cross thyself, you plague and vex me without need. For by my efforts you are about to reach Rome, the object of your travel”.)"  read through it, only make u richer by a phrase. someone like me, i'm memorizing it. i loved best the "musical palindrome" - bachs' crab canon.  tata, i'm off to look for it!

      and then there are days when i wish for someone else's life. only i don't know whose, and of what variety.  1 - i could ask for the workin-my-ass-off kind where the person totally loves his/her job and is dedicated to it and is good at it. each day is a success story. everyone looks up to him-her.. the - nice - kind of person. good at work, friends with everyone, gentle and witty.. oh :( 2 - maybe i'd want to fun life. workin hard partying hard. travelling loads, socialising and laughing. high adrenalin. 3 - or maybe the in-love life.. wake up in love, live in love, sleep in love. have the beloved by your side. (too pink??) but then there's sharing and growing. learning to love too..   what other lives can you think of? and if you had a choice what life would you choose?

      heh heh: this is my  urlLink email personality ... sometimes i find quizzes pretty limiting coz they don't have the 'all of the above' 'none of the above' or 'other' options... i still enjoy doing them!  Connector  If we asked your friends and family, chances are they'd tell us that email was invented just for you. Maybe it's because email is the perfect complement to your already outgoing personality. Or maybe it's just another excuse to spend time with friends instead of tackling that growing pile of work on your desk. (Weren't you the one who got caught passing notes in 6th grade?)  In any event, if there's a get-together that needs getting together, we'd guess you're the first one to dial in, grab your buddy list, and whisk off an irresistible invite. But with so many people to see and just as many places to go, a Connector like you needs multiple email addresses you can access through one account. Just imagine if you could manage your alumni, family, and friends' emails in neat little folders. And all in one email inbox! So next time you find yourself in one email account wishing you could access another, just remember you can!  *********************  writing is moving ... slowly working on my characters, thinking of a plot for them.. why can't they just make it for themselves...?   urlLink gurg  is the best! he really is! i wonder why he doesn't write more himself.   small things   urlLink this  is a pretty interesting article about the history and the different kinds of blogs people have.  there's a something about the way she winds her article into a story and yet not a story about the ideal way blogs grow and touch the lives of bloggers - the blog-writers and the blog-readers...

      when i was in college, i used to think i was a poet.. check this out!  (circa may 1999)  THE LIGHTHOUSE  Dwarfed now is its grandeur of yore By a multitude of buildings Thronging round it And a new lighthouse outside the coastal town.  Like a wife of many years, Newly wed, is the only one In the eyes of her man, Stood the lighthouse In the beginning of her time                 Grand and amazing.                 She was the only one.  Then crowded into the town The petty fry, Bickering for space and time. The new lighthouse                 like a mistress                 with finer looks                 and more alluring promises Stole from her the townsmen’s love. They extinguished her beacon of faith and hope Which had guided till then The ships, harbingers of abundance, Through times of fog and storm.  But she keeps ever her place. Erect she stands Though seemingly not as tall She glows still on a sunny day Reflecting the sun like a smile.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      one of the most satisfying things in the world: sipping on a guava drink with a touch of rum. it's not that strong, it's not that sweet, it all blends wonderfully - not really a godsend or a miracle from cloud nine, it is one of those drinks you could call an ordinary delight.

      well it's been years and years since i was born.  23 to be precise. here's what i've acheived: 1 - i can drive. it's been a big achievement coz i grew up in a world of non-cars = bicycles, bikes and bus no.11 (walking) 2 - i am slowly acheiving ideal weight. of course it's MY ideal weight, and has nothing to do with bmi, or weight charts. they all wish i was a skeleton. 3 - i know 9 languages 4 - i don't use too many of them and i'm afraid they're all rotting.  hey! that's not an acheivement 4 again - i got a short story published in our institution's magazine. it made me terribly proud. i still have the extra proofs they'd sent me 5 - i've made 1 decent oil painting, but it's too small to be called an oil as such. of course there are 3 more but those were experiments with colour 6 - i've also made a large pencil sketch. but it was a copy from a book. so it doesn't really count. but so was the oil painting - a copy. so this counts too!  - i don't really think there's anything else i can call a credit to myself. now i feel like a loser.

      so happy birthday happy birthday to meeeeeee! (i have loads of opinions about my own brithdate. that it's a special day (duh!) that there is no combination of numbers prettier than 22-10. that there's no season better than autumn. that i would'nt have wanted to be born on any other date, at any other time. same as i wouldn't have wanted any other name!)  i have been lazy .. but have been working on a couple of posts. there have been some beautiful things happening around me. one of course is this beautiful birthday that's still unrolling *grinnyfeelin* another is a trip we all made to the hills (that's where the stars were -previous post-) and i'm working on my 99-100 list (thanks to  urlLink none ) it's becoming more and more like one string of thoughts rather than a list.   the importance of a list  the 100 things about me list, the quizilla quizzes, the music i listen to, are all essential procedures that allow me to get to write. they're tools rather than gimmicks in the process of writing. precise eh? lol! i will be writing some more. i'm working on it. promise to m'self!

      and there were SO MANY STARS! if i could have reached out, and grabbed a few, no one would have known. the sky was a dense collection of energy burners. light years away. in a discussion (totally timepass) about time travel, someone was saying that if X could travel faster than light, he'd leave Star S at any given time, arrive here, take up a telescope and look at Star S to find himself waving back. the he-who-was-waving-back was the light that was emitted that many years ago as many light yrs the Star S was away from here. i promise never to read this post again.

      someone please tell me that this is wrong! whoever heard of a realistic n sensible vampire.    You are Form 9,  Vampire : The Undying.   "And The Vampire was all that remained on the blood drowned creation.  She attempted to regrow life from the dead.  But as she was about to give the breath of life, she was consumed in the flame of The Phoenix and the cycle began again."   Some examples of the Vampire Form are Hades (Greek) and Isis (Egyptian). The Vampire is associated with the concept of death, the number 9, and the element of fire. Her sign is the eclipsed moon.  As a member of Form 9, you are a very realistic individual.  You may be a little idealistic, but you are very grounded and down to earth. You realize that not everything lasts, but you savor every minute of the good times.  While you may sometimes find yourself lonely, you have strong ties with people that will never be broken.  Vampires are the best friends to have because they are sensible.    urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      state of nerves: raw. there's a burning in the head. in the cranium. i could flare up at anything. i don't want to talk to anyone. irrelevant incidents about some bitchy person SM, keep re-appearin in my head. and i don't even know her or care to know her. she simply represents the nouveau riche with an accent cultivated by watching bold n b'ful (argh) - that's the only thing which matches her intellect, or lack of it.  and yes, i almost forgot to mention it, i hate social get-togethers. or work related dinners or tea or snacks. anything that has an ulterior motive. i hate it. it rubs me the wrong prickly way. i feel like a hedgehog. and i hate making a menu, doing the dusting in a place that's dusted twfuckingice a day already.  there are days when all this is ok, there are days when it isn't. these are the days when i can't forgive my dad for calling officers (well i don't know if they're dumb or corrupt or both or none) and i can't forgive my mom for being tired coz she works the whole day. these are the days i like myself a little less. which is a whole lot less than other days :( i hate not having my frnds around. i hate not being just a student anymore. if anyone says another word abt me being married by this time next year i swear i'll pull his/her hair out. if anyone rings up to find out if their clothes are ready, i swear they'll never get to see their b'ful clothes again.  these are the days i wish i wasn't home.  or maybe its pms.  p.s missing half of kate n leopold (no i have never seen it before) doesn't help either.

      note 1  at the halvai  with all due respect to gurg and his strange attraction for indian food, here's a report of the mithai wallah, the halvai, or the sweetmaker (how horrible) in the festive season. bansal's the best reputed lip smacking sweets ever ever ever. what with all these festivals, their business is in full swing. went to get some stuff (drove down myself! in all that crowd) and see these huge burners set up on a side. at each burner is a huge kadhai (semi-pot?) with ooodles of ghee at which presides a halvai. fat belly sweating in a banian. he is concentrating on frying matthi's. flat rounds/discs of flour fried in ghee, eaten with mango pickle. yumm yumm.  so there sits the halvai surrounded by TINS huge tins of ghee, pouring monstrous ladle after monstrous ladle of ghee into the kadhai. then he slides the raw matthi into the ghee. it sinks to the bottom and then bubbles up like a u-bahn, sorry, submarine (ha ha private joke!!) then it's sent ofr a double fry to the next kadhai in line.. what a sight. and all that wowwerwhelming smell of ghee, much as i may love it, makes me un-hungry for a whole day.   note 2  this is how you should have your coffee  this is how, 3 parts water, 1 part milk, boiled. add strong coffee powder. add a spoonful of chocolate fudge - nirula's, or any other form of soluble chocolate. 10 ml of rum or brandy. this is how i like my coffee. how do you like yours?  no more notes. just reading archer - to cut a long story short. have hardy, grisham, du maurier (frm which era i wonder) and a few more lined up, so don't expect to hear from me very soon!

       urlLink gurg  showed the path to the  urlLink political compass  and guess what? i was:  Economic Left/Right: -2.00 Libertarian/Authoritarian: 0.00  can someone please explain what this means? i was never really interested in politics. the politicians in india are all selfish jokers, in search of that formula for perfect power. the current prime minister, although a sharabi kababi, is nice. at least he does good stuff. like the pokhran tests, his stand against pakistan, final inclusino of sikkim in india. he's reasonable, and constructive even if he's old. LONG LIVE VAJPAYEEE!!!! hip hip hurrah! ha ha ha!

      yes, this is finally post madness. not mad for posting, but post  (as opposed to pre-) madness. i am back to my routine, finally, gym and early mornings. it's a wonder how an hour of excercise can make you feel energetic all day long. on the other hand, mom's been telling me to exert a little less. wah wah! that makes my day. the only thing left is to hear her tell me to eat cakes (which i am already doing! sigh!)  damn i forgot to take notes again. my mind's all scattered.  they want me come to mumbai again.  probably a mindless casual visit, without any purpose so i am still waiting to see ... i don't know what's making me take up this commitment. ah, but i'll be learning something new. that's the biggest incentive. class type thigns again. yes i am a nerd. i like attending classes and having someone tell me stuff i didn't know about new stuff. and in this case it's diamonds. not that the pieces of rock inspire me more than silk does (which is also close to nil) but we shall see what we have to say after the whole training thing is done.  --== more when i can make sense ==--  miracle of miracles: we had bloody mary's at the dinner table at HOME a couple of dinners ago. dad made 'em. now that's something new! if only it happened more often!! and then there was wine ysterday. wah wah!

      I could be the most delectable, the most delicious, the most wondrous peach in the world. And I could offer myself to everybody. But there are people who are allergic to peaches. They may want me to be a banana. And so often we become a banana for other people who don’t want peaches. Better to say: ‘I am so sorry, I cannot be a banana. I would love to be banana for you but I am a peach.’ If you wait long enough you will find a peach-lover.                                                                                             Leo Buscaglia     How long is “long enough”?  You could wait a long time, and then find a peach-lover, but not one who loves your colour, or flavour, or size. Wouldn’t it be better if I, the peach, became a peach who tasted a little like a banana; and you became a banana-lover who liked just that little bit of a peach in a banana? Compromise.  Then, there are those who say, “Dhobi ka kutta, na ghar ka, na ghat ka.” (The washerman’s dog bleongs neither at home, nor at the river) They would say that the peach that tastes like a banana is no more a peach and that the banana lover who likes a peach is no more a banana lover. They would say that in such a compromise each party would lose its identity.   So I ask you: have you come here to find company, a partner, harmony? Or have you come here to be a peach in all its entirety?

      i am mad. insane.  i am also very very tired and i wonder what it is that made me switch on the pc and sit to write my two lines. maybe it is what i think it is: i am developing a relationship with this bloggy thing.  it's been 48 hours of maddening non stop takingcareofguestsandseeingtoithattheyarewelltakencareof = being a good hostess. my weet are forn out and my swead is dimming. yesterday i spent all day running up and down making sure the house was clean and inhabitable for the 10 or more expected guests. mattresses had to be laid out for the night, the lounge (read: sloth filth place = my junk) had to be cleaned up. my room had to gain a resemblance to a clean room too... sigh. mad work. and then.. i don't know what i was busy doing but i was dead by the time it was time to begin the party. this is my mehandi.. put the day before:   i might take a pic of it soon, before the colour fades.   -= later =-   well it is later.

      the weather's a-changing. and i can feel it while gliding back home on a cycle rickshaw like a pseudo queen! ha ha!  had to go book tickets for my aunt. sadly enough, i just got dropped and had to return on my own. now mine is a small town. to say the least. to say more, it's tiny, miniscule, miniature, petit, klein, piccolo, pequeno blah blah (and that's one of the things i don't like about it, and like as well).returned on a cycle rickshaw. i watched the new lights on the newly re-decorated shops; there was a heritage house (almost) [roshni from my kg days used to live there] saw huge UGLY signs on it saying AC & Deluxe rooms. ugh! the buildings are pretty - if anything here is pretty - and they've just about ruined that too.. the highlight of the ride was the breeze in my hair. imagine, sitting quiety behind this guy pedalling away, being carried like a pseudo queen (have i said that already?) on a dicey little carraige thing. it's october, you feel a chill in the wind as it blows in your hair. you want to grin and dance coz it's so lovely, but all you do is sit silently and tell the uncouth driver (pedaller??) to turn right.. sigh!  ah, but the breeze got to me. intoxicating. the freshness and the slight chill. winter's coming! hmm i shouldn't be so excited coz i don't really like winter with all its thermals and socks and layers -  but with it, winter brings a certain seductiveness. (ah! where'd that come from!) will have to put more thought n research into this thought...

      i watched a feather float down, dance down fly down, from my terrace. i watched it fall on the water cooler and then into it. i thought about picking it out and letting it fly down to the garden - i didn't.  all will vs. free will.

      someone was talking to me about how strange it might be to share myself with strangers. why do i find it so difficult to share the link to my blog with people i already know (barring a couple of them, oh well, one)?  i don't find it strange.   dad wants to read my blog. why? why don't i want him to read it? mebbe it's got something to do with keeping a private life. tho' in this family, what u thought between the last moment and right now is public knowledge. there are no 'secrets' or unshared parts of life. so why would i not share this? not that i have any gory secrets...   yeah. mebbe it's just to keep some part of me private, and away from scrutiny. even if that part of me isn't any different from the rest of the whole.

      this is truly jinxed.  urlLink CG  said she lost the post she had written when she wanted to BIF (bloggitforward) - and the same thing happened to me. of course it could have been simply because my internet connection conked off - and i hit "post n publish" without bothering to save my post :(  anyway here it is. an attempt at recreating my previous post.   Blog it forward  (BIF in short) is a concept started by  urlLink buzz  to whom we are all eternally grateful.. it's about saying nice things abt ppl and blogs that you like, that touch you - affect you. what i fear is that my BIF is going to serve only as an introduction of one person to another - what with only two people or hopefully four who read my blog. here goes:  meet  urlLink Crazy Girl : a crazy girl with a big big big heart. she's running  urlLink 500 miles to nowehere  and watches movies while she does it. currently attatched to her laptop she's working really hard at her nano - and approachng her goal. i really really really wish i had something of that drive - way to go CG!  meet  urlLink Gurg : a wise man, known to his friends as guillermo, or william or a horde of other names that he just posted up on his blog, i call him gurgle, tho not really to his face heh heh! he writes wise things even when he is drunk. i don't know tho if he likes being called wise. i must ask him.   no day of mine is complete without reading abt what my friends are upto. i also love to steal their quizzes and memes... i am sure they wouldn't mind coz u know, it's all about sharing in the blogosphere! eeeha!

       urlLink friday five   well here goes, yet another mindless list:  1. List five things you'd like to accomplish by the end of the year. finish that novel (and find a name for it); lose 3 more kgs' (pretty improbable); go to pdy (hopeful); fall in love (wishful); figure out a way to keep my room clean without making any effort   2. List five people you've lost contact with that you'd like to hear from again. i can't think of anyone. i don't usually let my favourite ppl lose me, or i don't let them get lost.   3. List five things you'd like to learn how to do. html; play a musical instrument - guitar or piano - or even a violin but i know that's too tough. there is the sarangi but i don't even know anyone who plays it; learn to keep my mouth shut - and also to know when i should; learn japanese, greek and russian. that's more than five now  4. List five things you'd do if you won the lottery (no limit). i'd travel. go to italy, spain, france and the likes, spend a month or so in every place that i visit. build myself a 5star luxury swimming pool, huge clean, blue and perfect. while i'm at it, i might add a sauna - and have a masseuse (?? gender??) on duty full time - for me and any of my friends who'd care to join me. visit pdy as often as i liked. paint walls and walls and walls - umm that doesn't require a lottery. well i could get huge canvasses and paint em and then frame them in exquisite frames. or also the old photographs, of my g'dad's childhood and the likes, frame those.  5. List five things you do that help you relax. musica, my pc, just being in my room on a sunny winter day, swimming or working out, a massage ! heh heh!

      a visit to  urlLink nanowrimo  wasn't really helpful. it showed me the millions who have already finished their 50k, and the billions who've crossed 25k... and lookit me. i'm thinking of changing my plot. no, not really changing it.. altering it. coz i have kind of run out of things to say with the story i was currently telling. i'm thinking of writing storylets and then combining them under one title as a book. it all fits under the 'puzzle pieces' thingie on my  urlLink nanoblog . let's see tho. i have started writing, so it should begin to work out.  i did get someone to finally read at least part of it. surprisingly, i got a few very nice remarks, and suggestions. i wish my pc was in a closed room, and not in the lounge. the whole house resounds with my typing. it is a funny thing, the pc is here, upstairs, but downstairs near the kitchen you can hear me hitting the keys. darned place wasn't designed with acoustics in mind. uff!  oh, and i have updated my  urlLink list  of "things about me you couldn't really want to know".

      and she says: by the end of it all i guess am going to put it down to a longing to be touched. there i've said it and may i be damned, but it's the closest to the truth  and he says:  i dnt tend and rationalize my behaviour when it comes to likin sumbdy - and luvin sumbdy - and wantin sumbdy - so it cld have been just abt anybody sittin there in frnt of u - is that what u are sayin  and she says: not at all - it being u had a lot to do with it.  so he says: that makes me feel better and then he says: but u know sumthn - ... ... u were made to be loved  now that's a conversation i could use in my novel.

      got home last night. the train was two hours late. waited one hour on the platform. sigh. i didn't know there were so many people in delhi. not an inch was spared on the the platform, what with the tea and pakoda vendors, the coolies, the passengers-to-be standing with their luggage, without their luggage, sitting on a bench, or on their bags.. the train officials were there too, and so were security personelle. fat, slobby sardar policemen. what can i say, this is my world.  over the whole week i gathered enough experiences to make the novel inch ahead. a new baby in my family, a 4 km drive up and down in one day (that's still less than the 500 miles  urlLink CG  is planning to run over the next few months! jeez!). there was a reunion, a surprise meeting, and discovering that i wasn't wanted in a place that was home to me for two years. or maybe i read the signals wrong. maybe i'm just not needed, which is normal, but not wanted.. that haunts me. it does.  there is this human longing to be wanted. a place that was home, with some people to whom you were laughing crying companion, working slothing companion, for whom you made tea when they slogged and who cleaned up ur corner of the room when you managed to make it sloppier than u could handle.... of course everything changes. with a heavy heart.  now we shall start working on the novel. and we didn't click any snaps :( but can post a sketch - some time in the near future...

      well, now we are officially in happy place delhi.   yesterday was an amazing day of girlie hugs, screams and loads of fun. class people met up at college and considering that we were al girls (practically) in college, now this was a total girl re-union. seeing each other after two months was as great as it might be after 10 years. who wants to wait that long to meet friends anyway!  it's good to be here, alone, friends, no family. whew!   road trip   not a road trip in the usual sense of the word. late afternoon i discover that i am a brand new aunt of a brand new baby girl. so arly morning we take the car and drive drive drive 4 hours.. and then late evening we drive drive drive the four hours back home. tiring but worth the pleasure. the baby was just a day old - not even a day old when i saw her. the face was sort of wrinkled up and she was so goddamn tiny - i wouldn't have dared to pick her up for fear of dropping her unless my niece all of a year old insisted "Maachhi aap mele baby ko uthaa lo" - translated from baby talk - hindi it means, my dear darling unmarried single and young aunt, pick up my baby girl. so there it was. the baby was hers. the baby girl didn't belong to her mom anymore.   the road trip. i frgot to say anything about it at all. we started driving much before sunrise. so, it was after a long couple of months that i actually saw the sunrise. the soft famliar colours, the ball of mellow gold that began its journey at the horizon and grew progressively furious as it climbed up and away..   more later.   oh and on the nano front: i finally have somewhere that i want the story to go. obviously muc influenced by events here in my life! but i ams till at 8 thou - and 50thou is nowhere in sight. NOWHERE :(

      my blog has been invaded by nanowrimo. sigh. only it's not such a bad thing.  the news is that we are going to delhi for an alumni meet. the news is that we are going to go there and have a super duper blast with friends. the news is that we are going to forget about this tension-less life here and go enjoy a tension-less 2 days in delhi. 2 friend-full days in delhi. where we will go to the cafe that G runs in our book heh heh! AND have the strawberry yogurt and pasta and ginger fizz... mmmmm drool drool.  the tickets are in my hand. and the neck pillow's already been handed over. i just have to decide what bag i am carrying, dump my stuff and RUN ha ha! the wait till friday is going to be simply interminable. sigh.

      i know that i might not manage 50k by the end of the month. but i'd have managed a 30k story. and a story that i'd like at least in parts.  -- don't know why all the sentimentality today. there was someone i had met recently. it's been a year, rather. we only talk online. i know this is dumb. i know this very very very dumb. but we've talked a lot, and spoken and seen pics and cam and all that. and when the talks got irregular, i felt slightly bad. both of us are short tempered. it's never been like this with anyone else. but we tick each other off. and now we don't talk at all. i've deleted him from my friends' list more than a couple of times. now he isn't there. but out of the blue he drops a message. he probably wants to talk...  knowing men, or guessing how they are, i'd say he's just spending some spare 5 mins talking to me. and why should it matter at all to me - i have a strange attachment to him. of course it is dumb, very very dumb. but at moments like this when he msgs out of the blue, it hurts. because at some time, at some vague moment i must have thought that we had something going. and of course there's nothing.  this is a stupid post but i'm posting it. i know i can always delete it.

      the noises inside and around a house define it as much as the looks of the place.  when i was young, there wasn't anything much near my home. i mean, there were no adjoining houses. therefore there were no dogs in the adjoining houses that weren't there. and there was n construction going on with maddening hammerings on the other side of the wall or marble polishing machines and the likes.  this post wasn't supposed to be like this!  i didn't want to write about washing machine drones and sewing machine cliques.. i didn't even want to write about pressure cookers whistling in the kitchen and my tv noises at night.. now i wonder what was it that i did want to write. but then, maybe it's not so important.  my house is lovely when it's silent too.

      there was a combinaton of things that happened to me today... added to the combination of things that have been happening to me in the last week, it is a surprisingly large number of lessons that life seems to be doling out.   - the phone call there was some news about a cousin that i was simply delighted to hear. i wasn't really sure if it was supposed to be a fmaily news thing, not supposed to be shared with 'outsiders'. - she had concieved- that was the news. now that i am putting it up here, it's more public than anything else. anyway. i wasn't really sure if it was supposed to be confidential news. so i shared it -out-of-pure-and-simple-harmless-joy with my buddy.  i got a phone call from the concerned cousin: i didn't want to share the news with your part of the family because i didn't want the whole world to know about it. the general train of thought goes thus, that if you want the news to reach everyone, just tell it to (me).  i agree, it was a sensitive issue. in the end, immediate family who didn't have the news got it through some strangers. and many people were hurt, all because of this leak here. i made a mistake. i realized it. and now it hurts. there is nothing i can do about it now but be careful about things in future. but doesn't the court understand that it was a harmless gesture??   - the missing packet lesson number two of the day. this was nothing new. i was supposed to exectue something, get someone to collect something from my office. it was my job to get the packet ready. i got the whole thing done, but at the last moment, didn't check where the packet had been kept. in technical words, i didn't 'follow up' - see the job through. so when the packet was to be delivered, i was practically in tears. got to hear a handful from my mom. it was my fault obviously. and this wasn't the first time it was happening.  we found it in the end and no harm was done.   - an offer someone saw the visiting card i made for my mom. and now i have an order in my hand for a stranger's visiting cards. i don't even deal in such work. excpet for that teeny module in my course...     what i want to know is... what's the divine scheme behind all this? add to this the recent visit to delhi. i wish i could simply drop all these things and go into exile. or just drop off the edge of the earth. sometimes i want to shut myself in a cocoon and sloth till i make myself do all the stuff i ever wanted to do.   (sloth here is used as a verb - maybe i should claim coinage rights?)

      the juicy news is that i found his phone number on my dad's cell. no i wasn't snooping. i was calling someone else and his name was just next to the one i was calling. now the thing is.. i am going to delhi - again - for someone else's wedding this time.. in jan first week... or maybe i am turning into an obsessed stalker.   other news  other news is that someone wants me do her visiting cards for her. weel... ahem ahem! this is lovely. i get to make some wonderful cards, do what i like, and she's going to be paying. wunnerful. there's this lovely idea of making cards with a white on white printing, with touches of silver. she's this spiritual healer/nurse... so. um. that's news item 2.   the most important news  comes in the form of an attitude change. it's not really a complete turn around.. but. there's some progress. some would call it a classic case of sour grapes, but let me not ruin it by killing it before it begins: i was wondering, this whole thing - meeting him and all that and wishing and hoping that he'd say yes.. was slightly off the mark. wishing that he would say yes is completely distinct from hoping he was the right one.  and more, i don't think i should be compromising.. he doesn't have time. he is OLDer, and fat. let me be judgemental, at least it saves me some heartache.   news to blow your minds  i finally am convinced that you can sit at home and make money. one method is: 1 - sit in the sun. 2 - drink a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice.  3 - shut your eyes.  4 - and wait for orders for graphic design to land in your lap. 5 -  it works   second one is being promoted by msn. chatting with friends. 1 - log on 2 - find your favourite person to talk to 3 - land up with the most awesome idea that's going to make a play that's going to be a best seller in your time, and a classic piece of literature in the years to come. 4 - dream, next, of signing a book for your co-author (the friend you were chattin with) and of him signing a copy for you. 5 - wonderful.

      i don't know what is wrong with me. i can't get the whole thing out of my system. every second minute a thought about the whole affair pops out of thin air and plagues me for - attention? completion?  - he wakes up at 6 in the morning and jumps for his phone.  - his factory works 24 hours a day, in three shifts. out of the three, he works two shifts and sleeps one shift. he wakes up at 6 coz that is shift-chage-time and he must take a full report of all that happened at work while he was asleep. - did i mention that he has a bodyguard?? - if there's trouble anywhere even at 1 in the night, be it brother's or sister's factory, it's he who must go.  - he corrected me when i said "status" (A as in Act) - as "status" (A as in stAY)  his father asked him what his response was. he says: give me time. father asks: how much time? he says: give me one week's time.  this was on friday. today is sunday. end of Day Two. end of horrendous waiting day two. and nothing happened.   there are still five more days that this silly brain of mine is going to convince me to hope and wait. why am i such a moron?   I WANT CLOSURE. and i am going mad :( and not only that... i want a positive outcome. at least give me a chance to meet him again, will charm the shirt off his back. and he won't know what's hit him. i behaved like some moronic village girl when i last met him. argh.

      - he is 30. - almost 6 feet tall, almost fat. - she has one dimple, he has three. - he has a dog he calls tank. he weighs 50 kilos. - he has a machine that prints 300ms per minute. she has a man who prints 5 ms in 5 hours. his machine prints 12 colours. hers prints 4. - he says he is headstrong.  - he calls himself a rebel. if his parents tell him to go left, he goes right. and she asks, "even if left is right?" - he is a gadget freak. mobile phones, laptops, dvd players crowd his room. she suggested he build a museum of technology that would track the growth-progress of these obsolete (he called them obsolete) models. - he can do all of his business by phone. maybe he can live with someone else on the phone too. why would he need a real wife? - he is a car freak. but he doesn't like to drive in delhi. one can't drive and talk on the phone all the time. - he made me laugh. he made me comfortable. - all the time we spoke, we looked at each other directly across the table, eye to eye. this is not what happens with people who meet for the first time. maybe it was not 'contact' but critique and/or appraisal. - he doesn't like social do's. he hates getting up to say 'hello' to ppl he barely knows.  - he is fiercely competitive. maybe he wants a wife who will be the same. cut-throat.  - but he said, people should be different, and not totally alike. if one is hard, the other one should be soft. - he loves travelling. i wish i had travelled some.  - it looks like he did all the talking, and she did the listening...  - he didn't say yes. he wanted time. maybe that means he won't say yes. it'll just be a polite "excuse me for not liking you." unsaid.   maybe i am weird. but all my life - all my short life i waited for the 'right person'. i never thought that i'd have to get up and run after someone to make him the right person. thought he'd come right out of nowhere, like a bolt from the blue - principe azzuro. we didn't DO anything to make this meeting happen. we didn't force it to happen. mom said she liked him (after she met him) and that was enough for me. literally. so the 'slot for the right person' was almost filled.   almost.  my mistake was imagining that it was really filled. inspite of the many things that i would have to compromise for, or change in future. i liked him. truth. i could learn to love him. that was my mistake. to be so open, simple, and naive.   life's plans can turn things around when you least expect it. to simply leave it upto to 'life' and expect her to brng you happiness, you have to leave it totally upto her. no matter what games she plays. she might almost give it to you in your hands, and then take it away. if you snatch for it in the thin air... it's only your loss.

      all this time i was waiting wishing and hoping and dreaming and praying (like the song eh!) for something to happen. like a fairy tale, for the right man to come along and sweep me off my feet. .. it's like this, it's going to be arranged. the match. and so, while i waited for the day my parents would tell me, here, this, now.. i was wishing for it to happen inmmediately. but now, there is a family in delhi. the family has a son in delhi. the son works hard, is supposed to be a mature responsible hard working person. and now all of a sudden i have an eerie feeling in my stomach. somehow i don't want to go to delhi next week to meet them all.. somehow i find myself wishing that this wasn't happening. if it happens, it's going to be final. it's going to be that step of life that's going to change everything. no more small girl spoilt at home, happy and 'fresh' and sweet. no more lotsoffriends and carefree joy.  i am scared. scared till my marrow..   writing is supposed to be cathartic. why isn't this helping. why have i finished writing about it in just a few words. is that all there is to it? or is there so much that one can hardly begin to tell. or is this not the timw to write about it. if i can't write here, where can i go. whom can i tell, whom can i talk to.  yes, all of a sudden i am extremely scared - this will mean becoming a new person. i am afraid the man i am to marry will be old and boring. i am afraid he won't understand me. i am afraid that i won't have the chance to say no. i am afraid of saying no even if i had the chance to because i am afraid that i don't really know what is good for me. oh this is hopeless.

       the movie  i watched "my best friends wedding' all over again a couple of nights ago when i had nothing to do. it was actually mom who had nothing to do.. rather, she needed some unwinding and thus we took the fateful decision of watching that movie together. now, before you proceed, you must remember that my mother loves comedies. the happy simple movies without any undertones of, or jokes on, sex, feel good movies, the more the laughs, the better it is. but of course, like us all, she is also a sucker for senti old hindi drama movies. the emotional ones that sing vande mataram at the drop of a hat, and then go and fall in love with pakistani girls.. well i like those movies too, but this isn't about that. we watched my best friends' wedding, and it was probably my millionth time. glued to the screen, i wished fervently that it would end differently. not till the end, i wished till somewhere midway - as long as there was a chance for lady luck to change the course of events... after a certain point, you know what is going to happen. the end is then a foregone conclusion. but for a long time i wished, oh i wished! sigh.  there is something heart rending about a blood-friend.. turning to someone else for life. in some scenarios it would be alright, but where there is attachment from one end... that is unfair. un fair    the book  after a long while of dawdling in modern day fiction, john grishams, salman rushdies.. i finally returned to good old thomas hardy. tess d'urberville.   in the ill-judged execution of the well-judged plan of things, the call seldom produces the comer, the man to love rarely coincides with the hour of loving. Nature does not often say "See!" to her poor creature at a time when seeing can lead to happy doing; or reply "Here!" to a body's cry of "Where?" till the hide and seek has become an irksome, outworn game.   ill timed things have thus been explain by the master of tragedy. it might be strange, but in this era of harry potters, i still find the poignance of thomas hardy's books unbearable beautiful. things that ring true, touch the heart - he understands inexpressed sentiments and portrays them with extreme delicacy. an art.     flutterby  international fashion  urlLink trends  forecast butterflies for spring 2004. there couldn't have been a more beautiful creature to portray in womens' fashion - ever.

      talk to me about sunday the holiday of the week, and i will tell you about the one day of the week when i feel crowded. well, not really. but i must find something to whine about, and this is the chosen topic of the day. besides, i really wish there were fun things to do in this village. my old old old, really old school, i was there in first grade, was supposed to be having their annual fete today, or so i heard. but i heard too late, and couldn't go. i wasn't even invited, even though the princi's my dad's good good friend. bad eh? i had nothing to do, nowhere to go. so we went out in the rain, yes, cold december rain, and shopped at the smuggled market - often called landa bazaar, or pakistani bazaar - this i don't know why, because most of the things there are chinese duplicates. well, whatever. i bought myself a cheap transparent mascara on one side, and black on the other. now this is something you could do without knowing eh!   state of affairs  someone we know is planning some construction in his backyard. this is actually what was being discussed when we last met: A- so don't we have to inform the (municipal) committe or take permission from them, or pass the plans for construction before we begin? B- actually we must. but look at it this way. they'll say: no loo, so it's a commercial construction. pay tax. then get a completion certificate after the whole thing is done, if it isn't exactly the way they want it, which is going to be crappy, no certificate. if it is exactly the way they want it, then they'll find something else through which they can extract some more money. it's better to make the whole thing the way we want it, and then when they come bribe-hunting, pay a little. that saves us loads more money, and much more time.  state of affairs in india, i fear, is not so good. i have seen this face of corruption for as long as i can remember. if what i have written is not credible or sensible, my apologies. because it was truly a sensible way of thinking. there is no gain for the average indian if he follows the law.  all the tax money is spent on politicians cars and foreign trips (et al). no improvement to his living environment - there's a park near my house. a humoungously huge park. ill maintained. the municipal corp recently built a 'pretty' compound wall all around it - 4-5 km circumference. it was fashion in the old 'fort' style - or gurudwara style, i am no expert. it already has cracks and all it did was block the green view into the gardens...  the bloody corp should have spent the crore (100 thou) or so on maintaining the park... that would have been far more welcome. but they generally choose the method that allows them to pocket large margin of the grant/fund for the project.   sigh. this is sad. sad state of affairs. and i've only just got started on it.   hic hic  when i used to read enid blyton (pronounced: 14 odd years ago) i used to believe hiccups were fun. now that i have been hiccoughing for the last 15 mins at a go, i must send my headquarters a petition for change of opinion. it is positively annoying.   news  oh and i met gurg online yesterday. this is what we call new technology. sigh, i know it's not so new, but meeting new friends is new. it's always exciting interesting inspiring - makes you stop and wonder at what might happen next. oh yes!

How, where, with whom would you celebrate to make things perfect? till now i have spent all my holidays with my family. mebbe it was because i was without family all the other time. now that it is the other way round and i am with family all the time, without family would be a good way to celebrate.. what do you think?  3. Do you do have any holiday traditions? lots. i am indian you forget. there are lots of holidays' festivals, and each one of them means a billion traditions. of course you mean holiday=this season, xmas et al.. but we have a zillion other holidays too.  4. Do you do anything to help the needy? mebbe.. yeah sure. all the clothes the spoilt brat doesn't wear, warm and practically new, bags, books - that were - then.... then.. there's lots more. yes, the answer is yes.  5.

"no," he continued, "till yesterday i wasn't sure. but last night i saw god, he came in my dream, and manifested here, around me. now i see him in everything" - points at the wall, me, his pot of colours - he dyes fabrics for us. his face was glowing as he folded his hands and smiled beatifically  wow

      and we are back. home is the sailor, home from the sea, and the hunter home from the hill!   the wedding  the wedding was in the family. a big huge family with tons of relatives from all over the place.. there were cousins and cousins and more cousins. mebbe if i had seen my big fat greej wedding i could have known if a comparison would be accurate, but it sure does sound correct. there were loads of ppl, loads of gana bajana - songs and singing (traditional wedding songs) and khana (food) and naachna (dancing). new clothes and looking pretty. it was one long party. quite like a wedding that one sees in hindi movies (bend it like beckham - kabhi khushi kabhi gham kinds).   and then other things  everyone fell ill. my nephew, my niece, my cousins' husband, my dad, my uncle, the grooms mom, my aunt, everyone i know fell ill.. fever, throat ache - some kind of viral. i have a cough too (no laughing-coughing here  urlLink gurg , just a dry raspy cough). the hill station was terribly pleasant thoughout the 4 days we stayed there. the moment we began to pack up and move out, clouds moved in - we left just as the first drops of rain showed up. and now we hear there was rain and sleet, hail and snow. what a relief. it's cold enough here without having to face all that in the hills.    an old mail - timeless moments  "saturday night... after a long wound tiring week. lots happened and lots didn't. right now alone at home, no roommate, no one around, it's almost like being back at the flat, on my own. at my own terms.. with music i love, a book close to me.. there's a feeling of timelessness about this. this hour, this mood, it's what you live for. it's when you live. all the other time-moments in the day, those are passing of time. how many more times will i feel this feeling, and who will i have, to share this with?  there's that intake of breath, eyes shut, and you can feel time stop.  everything is so normal then, the fan turning.. full speed too. not even the slow creak one could call nostalgic nor romantic. the fan turning, nostalgic (are they?) songs..   i crib and crave all day for some beauty in my life. it is right here. with me.  moments stolen to be with myself..  or maybe this is loneliness.   there are times when you feel like a statue. there is so much inside you that what is outside seems numb insensitive insignificant unimportant. no matter where i am, in the years to come, this feeling will remain just the same. this whole time-stopping thing. you can feel something inside you tighten, stop, wait to feel, to listen, to reach somewhere, way back in time, or way ahead in a place time-frame it has never been. and it doesn't matter whether it reaches back or forward. what you look at is the reaching out, groping almost for that anchor point, and it does find one. i still don't know what that is. it is a spot, a being with myself. it is just that time of the night or day, returning to a place, a world where no one interferes, where i am myself.  yes, i know finally what i am. and who i am. and this is the one person i have always had inside me.

      i forgot the word i wanted. the one that says that this is the time when you stand in front of your mirror and actually see the flab that's gathered at your waist while you were pigging it out at that mutton food festival all week (fictitious analogy!!) what i mean is.. it's something-something time. not really a rain check.. but time to face the reality time.. watever.  what brings me to this is a new development in my life. this is a semi self created monster call my master's degree. i have just applied for a masters in english. the kind of totally boring and crappy thing that i thought i'd never ever do.. but dont ask me - for i dont know - why i'm doing it. in a way im excited about it, coz there's going to be all ths fun reading - somuch poetry, these novels (EIGHT!) and these plays (EIGHT!) - some of them might be interesting reads. but some (read birthday party - harold pinter) are going to be excruciating...  anyway, torture when i get to it. right now am sitting with figers crossed coz ihave just sent in my forms. there's some trouble with my graduation certificates, so im afraid that univ won't accept me as a graduate.. anyway. hope for the best.. and pray with me, for me.. that i get through this, and i get through this alive (with my wits somewhat intact)... annywayz - that's the news. more about perspectives on life coming up in a forthcoming post ;)

      sitting in a middle of a veritable cacophony. there's a wedding in the house next door. the whole jing-bang is collected there and everyone's enjoying (i hope so) this very loud pathetic truck-wala hindi music. soon they will all be off to the bride's place with louder music played by the local band. among the very famous tunes, there's an indianised (or rather bandied  .. i could go on counting for a long time..  added to the cacophony is the music in my parents' room. playing voyager on worldspace. surprises the hell out of me.. mom would generally call that true noise, but right now, anything would do to drown out the noises of the wedding procession.  ah, well. im back. finally. after a not very short jaunt to delhi - again - wouldn't you guess? there's so much noise, i can't hear myself think :(  as a last note, i am pondisick now.. pondicherry sick. sick for pondicherry :( :(

       i did. i had made mental notes abt stuff that i wanted to have it out with - deal with - purge from my system .. but it seems a devious karma gnome has gone and done the misplacing act with them. the notes. so here i am minus notes, minus backlog.  it might just turn out to be a blessing. you know how having a clean slate always helps you live better. how exchanging the paper with the zillion crossed out thumbnails for a design - for a clean new blank sheet of paper can yield the most effective solution ever.. what you have crossed out, has shown you what cannot be - should not be - will not be. but the sheet is already ruined. the design will refuse to appear/manifest on this one. one must start all over again, but realise this we must - that it is the experience of the mistake that allows the design to manifest in its entierty.  realise, common folk, that thus spake great methinks the thinker, once upon a while, in her village. these be no regretful thoughts aiming at catharsis. these be thoughtful musings of a mindle ide - oops idle mind.   ho ho ho ho

       eerie dream   we were all very excited and happy and jumpy - of course no one said anything about it. it was a feeling deep inside.. we were off to a pub or someplace. funnily enough i was with three of my friends (all guys) - funy becoz in practice, i don't mix my friends.. like i don't mix my drinks heh heh.. well. so there we were, three guys and a girl. at a pub. drinking, and it was a party that i was attending with them. they weren't alll present at the same time. at the end of the party, i let go, and asked a 'someone' if he was a human or an alien. when he asserted his species as that of homo sapien, and not, as i feared, aliens who can take on the human shape (steven spielberg's taken??) - then i went ahead and kissed him. heh heh. nice kiss! then we returned (me nursing the thought that i had seriously let go... returned.. home? it was this lovely flat with wooden parquets that belonged to one of my friends.. he didn't really figure in the dream except for having that flat and probably being the one who took us to the party..warm wooden floors. dream like place. bright curtains. one room for each one of us... i think i woke up (in the dream) with a vague morning-after-good-sex feeling.. but i can't remember!   i don't even assume that it could mean anything. maybe if it were real, i'd have loved it!    i think  i am 13 years old again. not that it is really that far down memory lane.. just ten years back. TEN YEARS BACK!! i can't decide whether i want to feel young or old.. anyway. i think i am 13 again with this moronic crush on this movie star. ok laugh. laugh and fall off your chair laughing.. but that's the truth. and here, this sensible girl has put him on her desktop wallpaper. you want to see who it is.. ask me! ha ha ha. it's probably more the character he plays in the  urlLink movie . it was all the attention, and the way the character was moulded that draws my fancy. and.. umm of course the way he treats and manages the whole affair. heart rending and endearing.. sigh, don't get me started!   my horoscope said If you're romantically involved, expect a marriage proposal. If you are already married, your partner might put forth the idea that the two of you take a long trip together by air. If you aren't romantically involved, you could meet someone interesting. Communication between you and that special someone should definitely improve.  this is my daily horoscope. mebbe i should wait till midnight before announcing all horoscopes as bogus. but then, i have a lovely feeling inside of me. mebbe i am imagining it.. i wish it were true.   confessions  of a snoop. yes i admit it. i peeked in my ex's mailbox. last we spoke he wanted to know if i was sure i wanted out. then he dropped by the way a comment that meant that he was hoping that he'd found someone else in his life. it's his b'day today. and i - the large hearted sweetheart - wanted to make up - innocently, and send a simply bday wish. just, you know, to erase any unhappy memory that i might have left behind. so there we go, peeking in his mailbox to check if what he'd let drop was true. and yes it was. he's going around with a female who says 'honey' in every second sentence. eugh! sorry i shoudn't be bitchy! but i don't know what to make of it. should i feel glad that he's hopefully going to make it to the marriage pandal this time.. or should i feel sorry that everyone around me's finding their special someone.. and while i had the chance, i let it go.. sigh  but nothing can take away that lovely feeling inside of me :)

      funnily the days have been whizzing past, and i have no idea how this year has already begun, and is one week into january.. of course, there's nothing great about the change of year from 2003 to 2004.. and all that. but this fact does make me realise that i am not doing anything. nothing. seriously nothing. i might be going to the gym (no 'constructive work').. i help out here n there in the workshop, i am not indispensable, i do stuff at home. take care of things, make sure all ration paani comes, decide what khaana to make, make sure sabji is there.. and all that. but as i said, no one will miss me if i am not at home. i am not involved in something which would fall down flat in my absence. now i am not feeling this out of a sense of ego or something, that "I" must have something which finds me essential.. but.. somehow.. towards what is everything going? sometimes, i feel it is easier for guys. they KNOW they have to work at something.. and that the something that they choose will probably be the permanent something in their life. here, i am not even sure of what i want to do.. how long i will be able to do anything..  that brings me to point two.. how long can i hold my breath, and wait to live? i keep thinking, i'll start working after shaadi, coz then at least one thing will be permanent. but i guess that's the wrong atittude..    i went and bought a book at the delhi station. ladie's coupe. anita nair. interesting to say the least. it's practically all about women.. as individuals. the book fights for the woman's spacein society.. who is she, and does she need a man to make her complete?? and all that. anyway, at some other point in my life, this book would have seemed superflous, but - it's about a woman travelling alone with 5 other women in a women's compartment (puraana zamaana) - the coincidences were great !! ha ha!!   so it got me thinking. it makes me want to do something. i wish i could simply join a couple of classes and be happier.that would be the quickfix solution. but here.. i dont know what to do. i don't want to work in the workshop. it doesn't matter to me that it pays well. it doesn't matter to me that all the work is already organised, it doesn't matter to me (very selfishly) that mama has much more work than she can handle.. i just want to do something on my own. something fulfilling. that's why i've got down to some writing .. (hope i can complete something!) - a little bit of - not painting, but something inbetween, mixed media... i started aimless searches on the net for correspondence courses that i can do...

       a familiar sense of familiarity  i spent two days in a friend's house.. basically one night there.. and lots of time in a train and some other time in auto-rickshaws and all that. got back home last night, and there was nothing more wonderful than a long hot clean bath and oodles of my favourite cold cream... before going to bed. tell me, what could be lovelier? my brother was sharing my room.. actually it's our room, so while he was here, we lived in the same room. i know this sounds selfish, but it's just a fact that having the room to myself again was a wonderful feeling.  aw, and he left home while i was in delhi. we met in delhi, near the station. he saw me off and then went to board his own train.. which was supposed to leave 15 mins after mine, but left 3 hours late. sigh. sad. point being, that i felt :( when i said bye bye to bro. :( guess it's going to be phone - life now...   flushing him out of the system  flushing mr.sharma outta mah system. it some talking my heart out to two very patient girlie frnds. and it was a miracle. things like "he didn't give you a chance to talk" - "if you feel bored with him.. what's the point" - who else but good frnds can point this out? that, and a blank call. he did sound pretty awful.. a little coarse, if i may be allowed to bitch about him, now that nothing is ever going to come of it! and i hope this is the last you will hear me speak of it.    urlLink ladies coupe   on my way back frm delhi, i bought this book frm the railway station. my complete mini-pseudo library that consists only of indian authors (mostly - give or take some salinger and bach) has been bought at railway stations. railyway station -rather. usually the delhi station. excpet for one or two from the chennai one.. heh, don't i sound well travelled. the only thing is that i do travel alone. and i love it. every single moment of it.  there's this sense of isolation from time, place - location.. it's like being suspended - totally alone. no matter if it's a bearded man sitting beside me (usually chair car - you know, the seats are just that much more spacious than a plane's economy class) or an auntie from kolkata.. or some girl my own age. all i do is sit at the window (i make sure it's a window seat when i reserve the tickets - myself- at the station - in the queue -- this is a big thing for a girl from my family.. i mean. all the others just tell their father who tells their servant... but me. we likes to go on our own and get it done :) )so i was saying that i like to sit at the window seat, gaze out the window.. and dream. or read. - which brings me - fortunately - back to the topic - which i am afraid i was about to miss. the book that i bought this time on my return was "ladies' coupe". interesting reading. and a strange coincidence. the book - about a woman questioning the role/requirement/necessity of men in her life... meets all these other women when she chooses to travel alone by train...   please note. i was travelling by train.. a week after a close brush with someone i could have landed up being married to. it made me think. i am still thinking.  the one thing that counts - after the book - is the burning wish to DO something. to paint (like i used to- it's been so long, the hand is out of practice.. the eye sees no more. i have become old before becoming old!) to learn something new.. a new language.. to specialise in any of the lingo's i already know, to teach someone - small kids (but do i have the patience.. do i have the skill)  at least it's made me want to do something. it's going to begin.. something's going to happen.  watch!

       urlLink friday five   What one thing are you most looking forward to . . .  1. ...today? I am going to delhi for a friend's wedding tomorrow. planning to wear a sari .. me and my friends. so mom's letting me wear one of hers.. a lovely bottle green sari. looking forward to getting the blouse altered to my size!! yippeee!  2. ...over the next week? well.. for now there's only the delhi trip. a welcome break from home. of course i have been going to delhi much too often of late.. but then! also, dad suggested i get a long overcoat made for myself. so... anyone have any good links or designs... im getting mine stitched but i need a good design...  3. ...this year? the unknown! the surprising turns i KNOW my life is going to take.  4. ...over the next five years? ditto, doh!  5. ...for the rest of your life? multiple dittos! but of course, the dream of the hopeless romantic.. to find someone to share my life with. sometimes i feel there is so much to share, there is so much i have to give, i would suffocate, die, if i had to bottle it up in me. sometimes i want to be a teacher.. but.. umm.. this is not the answer to the question!

      and a whole new leaf to turn, and a whole new tree to grow and a whole new chance to bloom... corny corny corny  there's this very conveniently adopted attitude that allows me to say "i somehow don't get the thing with new year" it's just another day. they don't rain chocolates from the sky! but still, we go along with the holiday cheer and wish everyone a happy new year. think i could make it to the National Jingle Writer's Competition"? kididng.   yesterday was officially the last day of the week - the one week's time that we had allowed the buusinessman to think over his decision for life. poor chap doens't know what kind of luck he just passed over. sigh. some people really don't see good fortune even if it shares a cuppa coffee with them.   i've been thinking about it. and i have finally come to the decision that i am SO not ready to tie myself down with golden shackles. garn. we wants to see the world. we wants to go roam around. we wants to work our ass off on something we likes. and we is going to do exactly that. the world can wait and watch, or the world can prepare to welcome the new ME! balls to all businessmen in their big cars and bodyguards. grr!  frigging cold in my world these days. and yes, i am going to delhi this sunday . can i please be nasty??

      there is definitely nothing more delightful than a long hot shower in your own bathroom with your own soaps and towels - after having stayed out for months. the only other delight that can possibly supersede this one is sleeping in your own bed with fresh clean nice-smelling new sheets. now you know how i feel sitting at my pc and writing in my blog. i haven't really been out of town that long, nor have i been working overtime n not had a moment for myself.. my monitor was out of order. oh banal occurrence - it is surprising how the most insignificant, or negligble thing can upset your routine/ expectations/ plans.

      there are a few new additions to my reading list - let me introduce a couple of my friends. - i believe some of you have already met.. but here you are:   urlLink charles  : started his blog only recently. basically a graphic person, he prefers photography to writing. what attracted me to his blog is his regular updates of this diary he found in some thrown away stuff - dated 1975 - you know it's not all that way back.. and it could be anyone anywhere to whom this diary belongs.. somewhere i feel i'm snooping when i read the entires.. but the curiosity is too great to be supressed.  as for him, charles is still wondering why at all he started a blog.. so if you could help him find out...    urlLink dee  : newly discovered, i already feel i'm going to have to read her daily post before i make my day complete...       urlLink wednesday whatevers   1. If you were to commit suicide, how would you do it? this is the question of the century. if i were a jury member on the "Best ever question in a meme" contest, i'd vote for this. how would i commit suicide? this presupposes that i would want to commit suicide.. now for that i'd need lots of reasons.. to commit suicide.. i'm thinkin i'm thinkin..   well, if i were to commit suicide, i think i'd like to jump off a plane.. without a parachute.. of course i'd choose to jump over the sea.. the impact would kill me, but at least i will be sure i'm not landing on anyone's car in the city...  2. What is your best stress reliever? stress reliever.. working out, reading in bed, crying - yes, crying helps. it does leave swollen eyes and a delicate system.. but it helps. working out is the best, though.  3. How do you feel about jokes bashing the opposite sex?  umm never thought abt it.. there are good men and bad men. the jokes against men are directed against the bad men, the good men are generally safe from these - in my perception!   a very late  urlLink friday five   1. What's the most daring thing you've ever done? i'm not such a daredevil.. bunked some important classes? sneaked out of home (hostel actually) for a drive with the then current boyfriend.. smooched on the road..?? what is daring?  2. What one thing would you like to try that your mother/friend/significant other would never approve of? ahh dunno.. as i said.. i'm pretty sensible as a rule. i wouldn't want to have a significant other who'd not approve of stuff i do on an impulse.. my most impulsive actions are impulsive shopping.. mom doesn't mind.. don't have friends who are allowed to mind.. ;) heh heh  3. On a scale of 1-10, what's your risk factor? (1=never take risks, 10=it's a lifestyle) 3, definitely three. i'm a pretty 'safe' and practical person. .. even the risks i take are practically sensible..  4. What's the best thing that's ever happened to you as a result of being bold/risky? i got a new hairstyle.. or so i like to believe.   5. ... and what's the worst? i dunno. i have been lucky so far.    other stuff  i've been browsing and have found some interesting sites that help you write - even if it is nonsense.  one of them   urlLink fragments   is rather interesting. i might be posting stuff from there.. on the writing in progress blog.. poor thing needs a reviving boost while my nano breathes in my thoughts.. i will never give up that story.. i will finish it one of these days in my life sometime (ah procrastination.. thy name is me!)

      et voici mesdames et messieurs, le nouveau visage du blog de methinks.  this is a whole new resoltuion based on yet another whim.. my blog is now going to be peppered - liberally - with lines from other languages. this, or else, i shall die with all of these rusting in my head. bon? e allora, ecco un giorno assolutamente nuovo et bello. e cosa sto facciando? molte cose.. primo c'era un'ora al gym. poi ho fatto lo breakfast.. and now im running out of steam! sigh. first there was gym, then i had to go and take care of the block printer...   hey. this is beginning to sound like something i had promised myself it would never sound. strangely enough, in order to make a blog that rises above the common, that has a universal appeal (can't u just hear my tutor in these words? u can't? that's strange - coz i can! watch him say it again) for a blog that rises about the common, that has a universal appeal, it has to detach itself from the daily activites. people don't want to read stuff that they live everyday - OH STOP! did u just say  - PEOPLE want or not want to read?? are u writing this FOOOR someone? are you out of your head?  please refer to quote in sidebar. expecially the bold parts. that part was specially emboldened (ha ha) for you so that that would be the first thing to catch your measley attention. and now that you have somewhat remembered what we are on this earth for, we shall proceed.  event one to be understood through the writing of it: i saw my ex yesterday - after a whole YEAR - with his new fiancee (i know she is his fiancee coz i've been snooping - ew - in his mailbox - ew) late at night at a cafe i just happened to visit (the only cafe, please note, in this village)... grr. i knew he was in town. i knew he was sort of engaged. and i now know he's also almost getting married. but - but - but i am not supposed to know all this. sigh. GR! added news is that he was in my line of vision - DIRECT line of vision, but he was facing a perpendicular direction. not once did he try n meet my eye - nor say hi nor greet nor acknowledge. no, it did not hurt in any tiny remote forgotted area of my consiousness. but i sure got shook up seeing up. with a girl. but i was glad. she seemed nice, sensible, grown up. my height, my weight.. fairer, pinker. working girl who says she loves him a million times per mail. not too bad eh?   im glad for him at the end of the day. at least the responsibility of his -- umm despair at having been rejected has now been put in its right place. in the box of non-existence.

      this might be uninteresting, but it happens to intrigue me... yahoo - in a search for swead vegetables, turned up my site in the results. one of three. either it was someone attempting googlewhacks and i completely ruined their most ingeneous (sp?) efforts - or .. can someone tell me wat a swead veggie is??? or what swead even means!  there are no deep thoughts anymore. all that i think of these days is stuff about the stuff that i'm reading.. plot devices that could've been better placed, characterizations that lack unity.. mebbe i'd make a good critic one day. a good critic to webster (the ancient playwright).  darn. i should start taking notes about things i should write.. but im just getting more n more boring by the day.  more when i'm more thoughtful...

      i'm a simple nightsuit person. so, much was my surprise when my mom made me a lovely cotton-silk nightie, dull pink with green reflects.. like a rich man's daughter's nightie. so that was what it was called. rich man's daughter's nightie.  all these years it gave me great pleasure, and my mom much amusement.. and now, i write its obituary. sigh. it's old, well worn, and worn out - and now has a recently developed slit at the waist in the back.. which i'm afraid is getting longer and longer as i get more and more reluctant to bid it goodbye. so with this final adieu ... may it Rest In Peace.

      a deluge of music all over again. i've suddenly begun to download music at an alarming rate. now that i've got most of what i wanted, i don't know what else to get! it's the compulsive shopper's syndrome.. i-want-shop-but-don't-know-what-to-buy. i know how that is because i AM an example of the compulsive shopper.  shopping is therapy. new music in my room is therapy.  one of the loveliest songs i just plucked from the freeforall net-tree is barry white's you sexy thing. soft corner for the oldies! and here's my theory why...  as opposed to the concpet of 'harmony' in the western classical music, indian music is based on melody. one sinlge voice, or one instrument plays at a time.. a combination of notes - one at a time, generally.. to an accompaniment of beats - percussion - tabla.   this melody thing , or so my theory goes, is to be found in the 'oldies'. thus i enjoy those coz they are more like my desi music than any other..   that is why you can hum oldies or hindi songs - and never songs like time of your life - green day. granted that the song can keep running around in ur head.. but try singing it without the music. and then try singing a hindi song without the music. u'll see the difference, you'll see the melody!

      i dreamt of sharma again. this is stupid.  im putting him out of my head.  there's a funny kind of tension/depression in the air inside my head. (you didn't know i have air imy head? - now you do). i can't put my finger on it. mebbe it has something to do with mounting pressure with looming exam dates. i have never sat for an exam like this, where you have to write for three straight hours. where content matters less than quantity. where worth is counted by number of pages. my whole education was different.  why did i pick this up? exposure. mebbe i should learn to experience the 'indian' educaitonal system from inside? i don't know how this is ever going to help me later on, a degree in english which every tom dick n harry has these days.. but then, i never know why i do the things i do in the long run. nothing in my life has ever been planned. all decisions regarding my educaiton were impulsive. i don't regret any one of them. i don't regret anything that i might have missed along the way. but this exam thing is somewhat terrifying. i still don't know if i will be able to do it well enough. i don't even know how i am going to finish the long syllabus...  that's tension number 1  tension number two is the - sigh - uncontrollable swaying of the weighing scale from one end of the spectrum to another. i hate it i hate it i hate it. and then i sometimes hate myself too for it. this. is. probably. the. one. and. only. thing. that. makes. me. not. like. myself.

      i swear there are days when a cloud of melancholy follows you around like a menace. and at unsuspecting moments it makes u crave for chocolates or some dessert or some stolen delights. all menacing calories :( - and then u indulge. sigh sigh.  but the melancholy doesn't leave you. it's like when you're two drinks down, and then you get all nostalgic, and sentimental. and you want friends, and love and corny things in life. mebbe that's what happens when you have chocolate too (or at least in my case - mebbe im addicted to it -- is that possible?) - two chocolates down and you're all sentimental. you whine and feel tears welling up in self pity because you don't have friends. you behave like a moronic disbalanced teen.. i sometimes make myself sick.  a persistent feeling of groping in empty space dogs me. i turn to talk to someone, and i suddenly see there's no one there. it's like this false security at all times, that my needs are complete. one person, even a girl-friend fulfills this need easily- and actually no one can do it better - this need to sit comfortably, without any blocks, resistance, without feeling that somethings have to be censored, or somethings toned down, or some feelings, however instinctive they are, might be unture, so they should not be aired.. i don't want any restrictions. i want to open myself up and let go, let myself be.   but in a way, this restrictive life is kind of teaching me a discipline. but one requires a break from this once in a while. but this 'discipline is such that it can work in only this way - this way without breaks. it knows only this one way --- and i, i who have to learn, who have to grow and movie ahead, have to learn to be master of this. stronger than it. the only way is to let it control me, lead me for a while, till i learn to follow it well enough to change it..   tomorrow i shall wake up early and study from 6 - 8. what say!!

      the satisfaction of studying hard.. it sounds weird but true. of late i've been surrounded by piles of books, all open for references and writing away (as opposed to 'typing away', sigh!). and i feel like a scholar! heh heh!  the funniest thing happened a couple of days back. i dreamt of sharma. that was weird coz he's been the last thing on my mind in a long long time. and there he was, in that gfrey shirt which had become the greek burning blue.. . so there he was sitting in front of me.. telling me "and now it's only you, only you" i SAW these words speaking themselves. i READ them in my dream. i HEARD him say them.. and when i finished being dumbly stunned (it happens even in dreams)  i faced him with " and what about all those other girls?" he replies,"no, it's only you, only you."  weird, right? i am a much loved spoilt kid - i have no touch-deficiencies or any other weird love-deficiencies in my life. i know i wll get married some time down the line with someone super special.. but why this needy dream to see someone despicable say he will marry me! EW! and.. more! his mother called, i handed him his phone and he switched it off. and that, after my recent conjectures that he actually has a mother fixation. bloody oedipus! and .. even more! he started crying. so i held his hand and consoled him. FUNNY!  why would my subconscious want him to say he will marry me! why does my subconscious want me to be wanted by him when i already have loads of superbly adoring and adorable people in my life.... downright fishy, i say. this subconscious matter...

      my family is sitting in my room and watching the second one day international between india and pakistan - as if you didn't know. super exciting.. and nail biting. india loses this one by around 8 runs? that's what's happened. sigh sigh. all the super excited screams of FOUR! yes!! and the dismayed aww's and ooh's..   a family feeling prevails. my grandad has climbed up to the first floor to my room - which has the 'big tv, and the good reception' - so that he can further enjoy the match. dad and even mom are watching. now look what has replaced the long time favourite of the indian family - the soaps howling and weeping - the cricket match. and it is only the ones between india a pakistan.. living on the border.. 50kms away from lahore - we feel the distance like no one else. when we visit the border, watch the retreat at sunset, the whole ceremony acquires a whole new significance.. india on one side, pakistan on the other.. a tract of 10 ms in between of no man's land. ah!  sorry i got all senti.

      so we had this interview. where  urlLink keri  got to ask me the five most important questions of my life. it took me over a week to answer them. i didn't er er er all week..    1)    If you could recover one thing you have lost in your lifetime, what would you wish to find?   the state of having lost something is akin to that of regret. so far, i'm glad to say i have none (regrets, that is). of course there are lots of things i wish i had, like: control over myself and my life; a drive and a strong will power to see my projects through; patience with everyone, and everything. but then i never had these, so i can't wish to find these again.. conundrum!  ah yes! i wish i had (and i know it will come soon with blahblah) the sense of intimacy - that - i - shared with j - a long long long time ago - we were kids, but it was delightful - no questions.. no unmet expectations .. semplicissimo      2)    If you could marry someone that you presently know unromantically, and spend the rest of your life as their spouse, who would you choose?    if i had to choose between the ones i already know.. it would immediately exclude the possibility of being romantically involved with anyone, coz there IS no one :(.. so who will it be?? i don't know how this sounds, but if someone could become the person my brother is.. the comfort levels we share, the values and all that. if i can find someone like him i'd marry him.. but then how would i deal with two of the same in my life.. this gets confuseder and confuseder..  but. ..umm...there is one i don't really know. it's just someone i have heard abt, met once, parents were thinking he'd be a nice match for me. the thing is, i need to choose someone i start a new life with - from scratch. what good would it do to him to know me the way i am.. it might just be a different person he's marrying. i sound awfully horribly old fashioned and limited.. or what?      3)    You learned you have 24 hours left to live, how will you spend them and what will be the last thing that you see before you die?    my last 24 hours, i would spend them like i spend any other 24 hours. daily routine. because if i give that up to do something i wished i was doing, i'd be missing the routine, the normalcy of my daily life, which is, after all, quite a treasure to be reckoned with.  the last thing i'd want to see before i die, sunset in the fields outside my city. the last people i want to see before i die - my parents and my brother.. the last thing, the sunset. seeing anyone at all would be unbearable. painful.    4)    If you just learned that tomorrow morning you are to be permanently exiled from your country and can take just three things with you, what would you take?    lifetime supply of spices and pickles. all the other things can reach me wherever in the world i might be.. be it books, clothes, family - of course i can't carry my room with me. that'd look quite absurd eh? like a snail.      5)    If you had to pick the most difficult question you could be asked, what would it be?    there are loads of questions i have no answers to. like:  why are you?   the essential why and wherefore and purpose of my living. of my existence. i get fatalistic when i get to this point in thinking.. coz there IS not reason for me to be here. there is nothing i am working towards. there is no one i am living for. there is nothing i aim to achieve.  happy the way i am, changing myself slowly into the person i want to be. that's what i'm living for.  oh, now that we have an answer for this.. what's the most difficult question, again?       THE RULES! 1 - Leave a comment, saying you want to be interviewed.  2 - I will respond; I'll ask you five questions.  3 - You'll update your journal with my five questions, and your five answers.  4 - You'll include this explanation.  5 - You'll ask other people five questions when they want to be interviewed.  simple! but a prior warning is not out of place.. it makes you think a lot. a lot.

      what do you do when you have no one to talk to. what do u do when u realise that u have run through all the options in your list, and there is not a single person you can call to talk to ? what do you do when you suddenly realise that it's finally you on your own out there. being judged, being held responsible, with people who wish you were otherwise, with people who don't even remeber that you're around, with people in your daily life who are not satisfied with you. what makes you feel that you must live according to them?   why, even if it is true that they wish you well, the best, why is that that u don't want them to tell you how to live. it's not as if you don't know how.  i never knew i was non social. i never knew that i don't want to go out. the 'friends'  have begun to bore me. i can't manage a straight face in front of anyone. it's always a bored one. however hard i try to hide it.  why don't i get up and work. why don't i smile when i can't. why am i not the perfect person they want me to be. why do they want me to be something so difficult to be. everything is wrong. nothing is right.  and today, today when i have nothing in my mind. when i can do whatever it is i am doing with a clean clear conscience, today they are stopping me from doing things my own way.   for the first time, i didn't cry while she spoke to me today. listed out all my weaknesses in the glaring light. is it actually fair for them to know everything about me. just so they can put their hands inside me and try and mould me?  what hurts is that i know that i am not strong enough to go and live on my own, with my own rules.

The patterns, the crazy leaves,        the swing. The six smiling people and the        kisses of passion. Your pillow a landmine.

      In time the strong and stately turrets fall, In time the rose and silver lilies die, In time the monarchs captive are, and thrall, In time the sea and rivers are made dry; The hardest flint in time doth melt asunder; Still living fame in time doth fade away; The mountains proud we see in time come under; And earth, for age, we see in time decay. The sun in time forgets for to retire From out the east where he was wont to rise; The basest thoughts we see in time aspire, And greedy minds in time do wealth despise. Thus all, sweet Fair, in time must have an end, Except thy beauty, virtues, and thy friend.        - Giles Fletcher (1549-1611), 'The Elder'  in time i become pleasant. in time life changes. in time everything does.. and what is this rubbish   im evidently not too happy. pls overlook.

      a catch of a tune, a face cut, a perfume.. vagabond instances that have no right to walk into your ken, into my ken. they open doors to memories i don't even know are there. more and more everyday, the little girl in me longs for that intimate balance i shared with him. there were hardly any complications.. the ones that were there, were there because of the grown up in me, comparing him ruthlessly with ppl whom i knew he didn't stand a chance to. a glaring gap of thinking between him n me.. but it's only grown ups who think. small children don't. innocence doesn't think. simplicity doesn't think. primitive sensations do not think.  people now call me a person of the mind. i think too much. split hair. dissected thoughts. sometimes its sad to see my thoughts wander, and watch myself track them back one by one to the source that triggered them. i canconvince myself to love anyone. i can convince myself to do anything. i can't convince myself to stop disliking myself - luckily in this regard alone.   regardless of how little importance the grown up is given, it sits in the back of my head, passing comments on everything i say or do. the child then remains embarassed for weeks over playful comments.   writing is painful. it's been a long break.

      some more abt studies...  for those of us who are acquainted with the system of education in india, i am amazed that we don't puke - or spend the rest of our lives hitting our heads on walls wondering how this perpetually 'developing' country is every going to get to the 'developed' stage...  in short, no one studies in college - school. no one even bothers to attend classes.. where to tell the truth, nothing really happens - usually. everyone manages by attending 'tutions' = extra classes taken by the teachers who do nothing but sit in the classes. these tution classes are ways for the students to cope with the coming exams "these are the questions that you can expect - coz i set the paper."   they are taught the  right 'formula' to pass exams, and so on and so forth. what ever happened to good old enjoying the books, literature. whatever happened to studying in order to learn?? 'critical guides' have replaced original textbooks...   rant rant rant.. it hurts me to see this kind of hollow educationg going on around me. i was luckily in a different education system, and now that im learning all this, it shocks me. and there is nothing i know i can do.. rant is a result of the tutor (hah!) i go to, because there are no classes in my course.. and i see the others studying. studying how? copying down answers of possible questions in every topic.. and learning them by rote. gah gah gah!  okai, i have been  urlLink writing.. some .

      there are funy days and then there are abnormal days. today was one which came out of the blue. a day like none other, totally out of the context. when you feel that everything is moving towards a warped kind of an end. it begins like any normal day should - lazily. moves on to the gym where we work up a good sweat. return home to a slight minor lashing frm M. the weather turns cold and there's a consistent wind blowing from the north. we all go to the garden and enjoy the change from the heat we'd been subjected to. i go to the terrace and stand at one end, feeling the wind blow through my hair. this isn't something that happens here. this is something that happens only in pondicherry. only on the terrace of my apartment building. it's a private soul cleansing feeling - and it's out of context here. it doesn't belong here. in pondicherry i live inside out. my emotions and thoughts walk the streets - the very yellow-walled street and the straight one that leads to the burning blue sea on a hot afternoon. the events of my life happen on the phone to elsewhere.  and then it began to rain. a strange thing happend, some drains got blocked and water poured into our drawing room.. impossible in the well behaved household. it poured, i was in my car. one with the drumming of the rain. living my experience on the outside. impossible in this part of the world.  how can all this happen today. i am not in pondicherry.

      so now it's just one more to go, on 5th may! so wish me luck! it's all about fiction. there's loads of strategy involved in giving exams in india.. there are eight prescribed novels and here they are. share my agony:   joseph andrews - a picaresque novel by henry fielding;   emma  - a novel of 'sensibility' by jane austen;   great expectations  - gah gah, a choky horrible thing by charles dickens;   sons and lovers  - intersting psychological novel with an oedipus complex by d h lawrence;   mrs. dalloway  - stream of consciousness novel by virgina woolf - i quite liked it!;   passage to india  - don't even intend to read it - horrible colonial thing by e m forster;  and  jane eyre  - still good for a second reading - a compliment to charlotte bronte!  so you can basically see, that of the eight, i'm going to skip three, which means - as any good arithmetic student can tell - i shall have only five of those novels prepared. which is not such a bad thing after all. the amount of choice they offer in our MA exams is a miracle in itself.  more on that topic later. the only thing i can say that it is a relief to be typing instead of scribbling at the speed of 5thou words in 3 hours - which means, quick quick, an average of 27.77 words per minute.. and with lots of pauses to look at the cieling, i can safely say that my average would have been close to 35 had i written non stop. which is a paradox in itself, coz if i hadn't stopped to stretch my arms and wrists and crack my fingers, or turn my neck, i would have stopped before the three hour time limit. blah blah i go on and on, but it'd be a dream come true to give exams on a keyboard. ah, the relief of doing away with hand written stuff and pens and calluses on fingers.  my writing's going to the dogs. and i am going to pondicherry! cheer, dear world! 6th may, the day my exams end - i head for el PARADISO!! for those who came in later, pondicherry is where i sort of grew up and where my heart and my head and everything is. where i was moulded, and where i grew. of course that doesn't mean that my darling hometown here in punjab means nothing to me.. we will give it and its culinary delights their due credit another day. for now, here it is:  ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for PONDICHERRY!   urlLink     all about pondi!  this is the gandhi statue on the tiny and best loved part of the boulevard that runs by the now non-existent beach   urlLink courtesy     this is the view we used to have from our college classrooms. seriously, it was right there, on the road by the sea.     and this is the ONE the ONE secret part of pondi that everyone knows and that i love.   many thanks to  urlLink her  for capturing this most essential picture ever   a  urlLink street  in pondi. this is one of those summer afternoons and the bright yellow ochre wall..         and  urlLink this  is the what and the wherefore of me.  i know this is going to ruin all my efforts at remaining annonymous to the multitude who already know me.. but sigh. i leeeeeeaving on a jeeet plane. weeell, it won't be a jet plane (a train, rather) and it's not until 9 days from now. but what the hell! i can sing for the nine days... denver and kreva-whatever! turn in ur graves!!!!

      Mad Anne Read - Every pirate is a little bit crazy. You, though, are more than just a little bit. Even through many pirates have a reputation for not being the brightest souls on earth, you defy the sterotypes. You've got taste and education. Arr!  now that's a new one.   and i haven't really been around, and i won't be around till may 5th = last day of exams. i didn't know grown ups had to give exams too.. sigh sigh sigh. why did i ever take it up. lear and cordelia doing a death dance inside my head. pinter's b'day party orchestrating my tissue into tighter and tighter intrigues of aching muscle. and then i go on confusing Lerner's my fair lady with Shaw's pygmalion. why oh why can't we just read them, enjoy them and forget them.. why this repetitive redundant study??  if you catch me posting could you please remind me i shouldn't be here??

Oh, if it have, let my word worke on mee,      And a just office on a murderer doe.     Except it be too late, to kill me so,      Being double dead, going, and bidding, goe.  (read it aloud, no seriously, read it out aloud. listen to yourself read it aloud.)  it's strange, but there is an unbearable longing.. pain. inexplicable pain. i don't know how to handle, and not even whence it came.  tomorrow's the exam. the first of the four. if i live, i shall post again.

      "and i can't see where i am headed. the initial baby excitement of 'getting married' has run its course, not without its upleasantjolts. reluctant but good natured work at the blpr goes on - to no real purpose. there is no involvement in the areas thatmatter. exams are approaching, but the attitude is one of duty, shorn of passion.  i see happiness around me. settled bliss at home. the blush of a romance else where. small things push me over the edge and i want/lack the beauty that love brings to life. the tragedy is that i don't see it appearing any time soon in my scheme of things/life.  i am destined to find a purpose in my daily life, discover or even create a passion/dedication to some purpose before a chance for this sense of completion can come my way.  and the options are: unlimited, but unwanted. the intertia of a letharge -   or maybe the change will come like it has - over the last one year. creeping in without a squeak. unnoticed in small crannies until, slowly, it overtakes me completely and i become an entirely different person."

      i surprised myself with the following comment to a friend (who wouldn't have misunderstood me, however weird i sounded): "yesterday i finally got to speak with a guy."  taking stock of current situation, i am amazed i am still alive. the only interaction i have with people (apart from my wonderful virtually real ppl online) is with my parents, some workers at the workshop - which is as good as no interaction, coz it doesn't really count - and my instructor-friend at the gym. that's about it. and do you know what the most surprising part of the deal is? there is no guy interaction. i am amazed i live still. sigh!  some folks from up north drove down - and stopped here on the way to pakistan. as an aside, it's the indian crossover madness, initiated by the indo-pak matches. anyone who had any link with pakistan, anyone whose family had left pakistan for india during the Partition (1947) - got visas - apparently for the cricket matches. and now the whole country's out to visit The Neighbours, who, it seems, are suddenly exceedingly hospitable and warm and loving. i know i sound cynical, even though i don't mean to.. but mebbe it's the sour-grapes syndrome coz we aren't going (my dad's mom's family's from lahore. so i have my roots there too). so this bunch of far off relations-family stopped by for a quick tea before the last lap to the wagah border.   the point that im driving at is that they had a son. the point that i am trying to make is that the son is six years younger than me. the slight swagger, the newly coaxed stubble, the sideways glances in passing mirrors - new found confidence. the almost shy, but not really shy, way of talking; courteously opening and shutting the door for me - aww!.. it would all have been endearing - like watching him grow - and i would have been an auntie. whereas, i found it sexy. i was attracted by a kid.   maybe i should do something about this lack of men in my life. seriously. *quietly begins to hit her head on the wall*

      how do you write about feelings you weren't supposed to feel? this is a friends changing life. how do you feel her pain, her apprehension at the coming change? how can you see through her bravado? how can you peep into her soul? how can you put yourself in her shoes, like you've known her all your life - when you've only known her a couple of months.  she's getting married. a close family friend. i feel like an invisible person around her, she showers me with love, affection.. the whole thing revolves around one undeniable fact: that she lost her mother. it's been a year now. and, she, finds solace in my mother's presence. which automatically puts me where she loves me too. and.. she does. and. she is so open and frank. transparent is the word. you can see the gap their mother's passing away has left in her house.. and that hurts.  more than anything else, i am scared it'll happen to me.  there, i said it. and i can't face it.  you can't pin point the moment where a friendship tranforms into a bond.. a relationship. like a rishtedaari - family thing.  i know, i've been away. there've been lots of things.

      i reached pondicherry at 4 pm. i was entering the city by car, from the other not-so-familiar end. and so i almost missed out on the unbearable excitement of the familiar East-Coast Road that runs along the sea, and gives occasional peeks of the bay of bengal. there were some familiar landmarks, and then the hospital where i almost died (ooh melodrama) and then the intense ex boyfriend of two of my friends - both of whom are now married to someone else.. and then famliar roads, streets, the shopping street - Jawahar Lal Nehru Road.. and, there it was. my pondicherry! the all too familiar red roofed pretty but empty house. our student's mess - the corner house. and there, 1 rue compagnie! all i had to do was walk up, and call @. oh and the sea. and then my favourite street down to my home.. oh and then home. the watchman was delighted to see me. he almost fell off his stool. and in his funny hindi he started "arre papa! aa gaye! amma papa kaise hain? anna kaise hain? unko kehna poocha hai.." (arre girl! - BAD TRANSLATION) you've come! mama papa, how are they? how's your brother? do tell them i asked about them..)  and then i put the key in the door of my flat,  and opened the house   of which i had dreamt so much!   heaven! it was full of dust, messy, the fridge had fungus coz it hadn't been cleaned before the last person had left. there was stuff lying all around the flat. the cupboards were smelling. one window was broken. the grill on the door needed to be changed. but i was home. home like a private little heaven that only i could access.  sometimes i feel that even if someone else does have the key, does use the flat to sleep, live, bathe, eat, only i can liiiive there. and the 'flat' the home that i know, no one else knows.. easy subjective ways to make myself happy. but there it is. i was home. i had physically reached that specially guarded memory of late afternoon sunlight, white walls, and space space space. fresh floating flowers, incense, cool floors, happy solitude. i was home!  then of course, there were dead cockroaches lying all around the place :( sharp thud brings us back to reality. it seemed like some entire colony of roaches had chosen Faith II as their sacred dying spot. or maybe my brother will be happy to hear about the results of the pesticide spray we used the last time we shut the place. i had to clean everything up, so i called the maid, cleaned the loos - while she did the rest, i had a quick shower and rushed out. out to the city of the open sky. city of the favourite street (i must ask someone to click a snap and send it to me!)   and there it was. the ashram. peace. flowers at the samadhi. the cool feeling of marble under the palms as i did pranam. the feeling of pebbly ground under my bare feet. lifting the edges of my salwar coz i had tied it too low for walking barefoot, i walked back to my slippers. and walked into a crowd of zillion teachers, group captains, classmates parents and, well, ashramites! warm loving and almost snoopy.. i'll dedicate a separate post to that species..  walked over to @'s. had a nice long chat about god alone knows what. it was lovely seeing him again. easy banter. nice music. comfortable spaces. great!  the day ended with loads of shopping at grinde's - the old favourite place for all general merchandise. i bought us some sorely needed footmats. detergent, soap, shampoo and the likes. and also the lovely palmolive green powder that i was missing! walked home on the lovely street. read some. slept!  the next day was yet another lovely day! (more so coz i did lots more shopping, but more about that some other day!)

      all good things come to an end. it's a good thing that all bad things too follow suit.  im back, home. almost. right now i'm at the new delhi station, preparing to while away precious 3 hours of my life waiting for brother dear to appear in another train that will come, as i said, in another three hours. mine was almost an hour late, which, for once was a good thing coz that brought the four hours of waiting down to the aforementioned three hours .. round and round eh?  so i'm here, in delhi. like a no man's land. almost before i get home - that is 8 hours (+ the three aforementioned = 11 hours frm now) that sounds like a long time. so im here. it's taking me a long while to believe it or to get used to it, as you can see. i can't believe that the trip is already over. it is harder still to come to terms with the fact that it began, and has ended.. shortlived delights! but i suppose that adds to the pleasure of waiting for it. there is so little of it that i can barely begin to ever tire of it! (ah optimist!)  the streets in pondi were exactly the way i had left them. nothing had changed. n o t h i n g. which was a relief. for 12 short days, i extracted the memory of pondi from my brain (or wherever it is stored) and lived it all over again. there were no changes. it was full of its lovely yellow walls and blue skies... not to forget the shiny greenery all around. blessed was i coz in the middle of May pondi experienced some freak rain showers. everyone in asr had been saying that i'd get roasted in pondi - but having spent half my life there, i thought the conditions would be bearable. they were more than that, they were wonderful! alternatingly rainy and sun bright. lovely breeze at all times of the day. i frequented all my favourite places. had loads of coffee. and walked up an down my favourite street like i had nowhere to go!   i also made 1, rue compagnie, my second home - or haunt - as discussed with relevant ppl. more about that later, in relevant posts.   and then i packed up my memories in off white crinkly butter paper. right now im carrying them with me. when i get home, they will go back to where they came from, under the paper under the piles of unworn clothes in the cupboard i don't really use.

      but the pleasure of being in pondi is almost killing me!  it is all about the sun and sea and the sky. and the 'unbearable lightness of being' (will write about it when i get thru with it) and running in thin rain, rides on bikes, leisurely cycling down familiar roads.. people i have known since forever...  whoever sees me, meets me with love and affection. it's touching to see everyone stop and talk for ten minutes on the road. of course it could also mean that i'm extremely sociable. i tried keeping a journal as  urlLink jamie  suggested. haven't really gotten anywhere with it. the only thing it drives home is the looming date of departure :((

      has anyone ever felt a sudden rush of mad enthusiasm? mad enthusiasm for totally unrelated projects?  i am sure we all have, at times, been completely taken up by what seem at the moment, mind blowing projects. voila. me, a mad girl.  even as i type, idea after burning idea sears my brains, and i want to get everything done immediately. what amazes me beyond belief is that in the normal world, a normal person has to face uneneding opposition in the scheme of things. but ideas i had discussed with my mother more than a year ago, are coming back and, surprisingly, coming alive. all of a sudden, i can see myself taking the challeges up.  i wanted to start a yoga class session. because i felt capable of helping people out with their trouble.. i am not professionally qualified in the field, but i have definitely had lots of hands on experience. and, some say, an exceptionally good had at massage.. for the muscles.. and spots. anyway. the point being: our physical education has given us a deep understanding of the body and how it works, especially where the muscles are concerned. i don't claim to know much, but instincts do help out. and i do hope to learn. mom and dad are not even in town. but the moment i said i could start yoga classes, and that i already had ppl who were eager to know more.. dad said: take that room, get this fellow to install a new AC and start.  then, the thought of some paintings i wanted to do, tiny sketches, cartoons, illustrations.. simple stuff to decorate the walls.. came back. and - co-incidentally, i was surfing the net and came upon this treasure of lovely caricatures and girlie cartoons, which.. goodnes, i don't even know what i am saying. but this i do know: i have already dug out my paper, and my paints, and my ruler and my blade.. and the room is set for an all night session. if it is not successful, at least it will blunt this numbing enthusiasm.   i always wanted to start a cafe - a kind of a corner, with books, coffee, paintings - somewhere. a niche. a nook that people would be comfortable in.. music. discussion. have reading evenings. reading for children.. i am getting flooded with these ideas, and i am soon going to lose my head.  but of course, tonight is just a night. we shall see how long the enthusiasm lasts.. what comes of it. even if an iota of this sees light, i will consider myself a little better than the current loser image i have of myself.  and... the work i'm handling for ma, that's going normal. moving along. and there are loads of offers. i am going to die!

      blink.. blink.. blink  the cursor does that. not me. blinkblink..   i don't know what to say or do. a sudden sense of inadequacy has overcome me. there was this piece i began.. embroidery- the colours never matched. and now halfway through, and with a lot of time = money already wasted on it, it looks AWFUL. honest to god awful. and so anyway. it looks like im going to have to shelve that piece till mom returns. i've begun something else instead.. green green green.. :-? im feeling low, inadequate .. and the funniest part is that it's a pendulum. all day i was high on a wave of enthu - (one forgets that the wave has to crash when it reaches the shore) - planned some new outfits. mostly for myself - or other young girls. i am so totally not cut out for this work :(  anyway. another thing to make me feel lovely, and awful at the same time.. i watched a hindi flick. mushy sweet lovely endearing, and some called it pathetic.. quite contradictory.. but whatever. starring saif, sigh..f. i could go on and on about the movie being 'inspired' or the movie line having been completely lifted from When Harry Met Sally.. but that's the hindi touch! but let me return to my cup of joy - saif. he has a pathetic voice, lovely comic timing, and a something that tugs at the heart strings. this is not mushy fan drool, this is.. sigh!  urlLink listen to his voice    ok, so at least i have a crush. and i have a more real crush on U.singh.. what's going to become of me.. im losing my marbles. my balance.

      dear bloggie.  i am writing to tell you how i have been. i know you aren't really interested. you might be more interested in a bag of popcorn and a movie starring al pacino and brad pitt. but for now, you'll have to put up with me. coz ur mine. and i made you (of course the credit goes to blogger n the various amazing ppl behind the scenes too, or rather, mainly). not only 'put up' love me. no choice.  dear bloggie. like i already said, i'm writing to you to tell you how i've been. how i've suddenly felt vulnerable. suddenly in love. with a someone i don't even know. search your memory and you might come up with USingh. tch. bloody custard. how can you fall in love with an image you never met? how can you believe you want to Spend Your Entire Life with this person who seems too perfect to be true. too perfect to ever be yours. too perfect to even notice you're there. ah, but he called up to talk - to your father. not you :(   dear bloggie. i got my hair cut again today. therapy for a lonely heart. then as i had the bigger car, with the newly installed music thingie, i took it for a round. a nice long round on one of the loveliest roads in my village. it runs along a stinky sewage canal. you can learn to forget it's there coz ur windows are shut. but it's this winding round smooth empty road, that leads to nowhere. nowhere is the next country. on the way to nowhere there is nothing. and the weather was lovely. a nowhere-kind. neither rain, nor sun. wind and dust that settled with a few pseudo raindrops. it was like floating in a bubble. familiar music numbing my senses. a blur outside the window.. a feeling of being nowhere. the place wasn't familiar enough to intrude on my privacy, it wasn't new enough to make me curious. deadening of the senses. or was it a tingling of the sensations.. reaching some kind of a daze, a intoxicating levelling of the consciousness -   dear bloggie. on a small-girl tone, i feel bad. my friends know i am alone. but no one calls, no one mails. i do all the calling and mailing, and reaching out like a loner. like a needy fool.   :(

      and i had thought that when i would be home alone, i will be able to write oodles and oodles and oodles of stuff in the blog. that i will be able to give my much neglected writing challenges in DII some attention. that i will have lots of leisure time and that i would do some creative and sensible work in the 'leisure time'.   turns out, i don't have leisure time. and when i am free, all i want to do is crash, or get some cheap entertainment. now who's tried the 'french pop-tarts'  IMVironment in Yahoo messenger? it's an AWESOME timepass. awesome is not the word. it's an understatement. it's mind bogglingly dumb and time consuming. and it makes u a complete addict, all u want to do all day is serve truck drivers some toast.. funny eh?  the other day i ran through something on gurg's blog.. it was a discussion about the god's will and general will. in my life, in my sphere of consciousness, the terms are All Will and Free Will. allwill is god's will. the Will that decides what directino your life will take. what your possible weakness can be.. and whether it'll rain today. and free will is:   i was walking by my garden. i watched a feather float along with the wind.. down down down. i looked at it falling. i didn't bend to pick it up. it reached the ground.    this is free will. the will not to move the feather.    the all will also leaves lots of choice for us humans. it might give us the hypotheses of the problem, but it leaves us full room to develop our own solution. and while the solution can only be one - The One Solution - which, depending on our upbringing or religion differs vastly - the route is our choice. and so. the all will decides the destination/destiny. but it loves to watch us work towards it. it revels in watching us make the right moves. and nudges us when we slacken. this is the Divine Grace.    and we are Her/His/Its toys. Maya. according to some hindu lore, God (Purusha) was getting bored with his creation. his beautiful worlds, and creatures. and then he called Maya (Illusion) to entertain Him. Maya spun a web around the world which causes us to lose our way, on the way to our destination. watching us blunder along - and attaining our destiny gives Him delight. hes Leela, we are his Game. Le Jeu Divin.   ------------------   Mirror magic   mom and dad left for the US a couple of days back. today was technically day Three of being on my own. i got some payment (minor) and a nice couple of customers - mother and daughter - who bought the SAME suit. heh heh! It was the one i'd just got printed. the black white grey and red one. awfully smart i must say. and they do have an awfully good taste! will be putting up a pic of that suit soon :D   work's not really going on that fine. the handling everything is not all that easy. especially when there's really not much work. creating work for the tailors is not really fun. more than the tailors, it's the hand embroiderers who need work. and i don't really see a conjurerer in the mirror.   there are some fun outfits i can't wait to have made. and some that are really not turning out good. im apprehensive about the one I's started now. on purple. but the one with the tibetan roses is coming out pretty cool. i've also made the new pattern and shall be implementing it in the next piece we make in the same style. so, conjurer. more till we meet next.   did you know u'r quite a loser. you haven't even thought about the DII challenges. quite horrible.

      there's nothing better than writing a mail, and having blogger publish it without going through all the bother of loggin in at the blogger site, opening the account and all that.  i know everyone already knows this, but i just realised the huge comforts of the arrangement :)

      am too lazy to post. frantic preparation is going on at home. bro's home. he has to shift to the Western metro of india, after having covered the other three zones. work. parents are preparing a trip to the US.. where most of my readers are. most? the few that i have ;) all of u folks! they'll be going to new mexico, and umm.. new york. and umm.. houston.. and im bad at geography. so, i was saying, frantic prep's. packing, for the exhib there. and so, im busy getting involved with the workshop. have to handle mom's work while she's going to be gone. (for a whole month n a half :( ) going to live alone. never stepping out of home. among so many other ppl, but still alone without family :(  im tired. i'll write more some time before the end of the week. these few words are simply to remind me that i must write. that i have a lot of that log to re-experience. that i have those dreaminginink challenges to meet. that i must must write. that i must have something in my head that makes me want to write.  tho, to tell the truth, i have been creatively involved of late. with drawing. patterns. but not writing.

You're inner Bombshell is the beautiful Audrey Hepburn. Like her you've been blessed with a "certain something" that no one could describe accurately. You are more reserved than other bombshells, and that shows in your gentle, graceful nature. You like doing things for other people and love volunteering for your favorite charity. Yours is a rare gift in this day and age. You don't need to show a lot of skin to be sexy, all you need is your eyes.

                     i'd begun a post more than a couple  of months back. it was all about how i now think of my blog as another world,  and my blog friends as another family!      &nbsp;    i don't claim to be a budding  author (though i did try my hand at the nano, and failed miserably). this blog  is not even one of those linkoramas with links to all the links to all the  wonderful and intriguing news around the world, categorised according to  interests. nor do we have regularly updated columns on the world politics.  bloggie's a mix between a writing therapy - a message board - and a platform for  introspection and meandering thoughts. it consists of some of my scariest, most  reluctantly admitted thoughts, some of the most treasured fantasies. it's one of  those normal people whom you don't notice in a crowd. and it's a year  old!      &nbsp;    i change when i write here. it's  funny what a pseudonym can do! over time, the pseudonym becomes someone, and  develops an organic world, be it virtual, but organic!      &nbsp;    happy birthday again, methinks and  bloggie. it's just a year, and i wish me many more years to go. god give me the  perseverance to continue updating it with details of minor importance, and my  friends the patience to keep returning!      &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;

                     i am scared that i don't have the  vision of a stronger imagination. or rather, scared because i don't have it. i  can't see the end product when i begin working on it, and the final result is  always a surprise.      &nbsp;    i am scared that i have been doing  things wrong.      &nbsp;    i am scared that my laziness has  had an adverse effect on the work. the craftsmen can see i don't have any more  work to give them. the lack of enthusiasm - or of a professional facade is  probably contagious. and i am scared of that.       &nbsp;    i am afraid i have done so many  things wrong. it's only a short period and so i agree to take care of the unit.  but otherwise, it's not my thing. i'd be happier working on my own. no one to be  responsible for, and no one to answer to. no one to give orders to. just myself  in the equation. and that is almost more than i can  handle.

                     a major contribution to the  slowly rising sitemeter is the traffic searching for a photo of ' mehandi '.  some also came looking for railyway - spelt wrong. and a sexy suit (recently  posted) - and, funily, there've been quite a few people looking for  letharges   and  ignoramii       &nbsp;    that apart, everyone meet  dee  (#2- dionysus). and  please give  this fellow  a  job. please.

        if this was a letter pad or "scrippling pad" (as my sketch pad of cheap paper was called by the local stationer) this would be the last sheet. and hopefully, i'll be able to post it. no matter what.         i've been trying to write for the past one hour. all i've come up with is mundane musings about the weather and how it changes in this village of mine, how we like the music we like, how we (read i) are fickle enough to change our minds at every given opportunity. so today, i am finally going to a friend's place, where we will both indulge in the most primitive and the most refined form of timepass. painting. the way we paint, it is timepass. and TP in our college lingo is really the lowest level of interest and productivity that any activity can attain. i promise to put up the results of the day. maybe we'll even put up pictures of us painting, hm that's a thought. and i bet that'll be more interesting that the stuff we ome up with!         my parents will be back in, guess guess... 10 days! the countdown begins. and like a little girl, im going to cross off each day as it ends. of course, everyone dreams of the day he-she will get to live alone at home, with the run of the things and everything in his.her own hands. but trust me, i detest any sort of responsibility. and truth to tell, now that the "little girl" has finally stepped up and sort of taken care of the work.. with the return of the mama, the little girl will have to work harder. figure that out,  but it's like that only . (a la indian accent).         which brings me to a funny topic. my indian accent. of course i'm indian. and i talk basically english n hindi (apart from the others i claim to). and my english is so full of indianised words and  hinglish , and so punjabi in its accent. ha ha! who's ever heard someone say buhd-MIN-ton, uh-SEPT (that's accept) and other stuff. i have.      who's ever seen the wind? i have.      heh heh.  that was stupid.         well i'll end the miscellanous dumbass things here. happy sunday to everyone.

                     CHB = could have been.      &nbsp;    i don't want to land up at the end  of my life with nothing better in hand than a bunch of chb's :( but that's  probably just how it's going to be. and you know the worst part? the chb's are  all in my head.      could have been a good  fling.     could have been a good marriage.       could have been a lovely  painting.     could have been a wonderful  business.     could have been a happy life.       (ok the last isn't so true. my life  is already wonderful. i was just - umm - getting into the moment!)      &nbsp;

                     and tonight i shall dream of  a younger al pacino ;) heh heh. i spent the whole day with my ass moulded in the  bean bag. most of the time my eyes were glued to the tv screen. watched the  godfather (yes yes, i confess, for the first time) - and began watching part II  too. and that's why i'll probably dream of al pacino tonight. it's not about  being good looking. it's not about being a star. it's about the measured  confidence. the restraint. it's about smooth and solid teakwood. polished  granite. slicked back hair, impeccable silk suits (he wears raw silk at times,  and man, can he carry that stuff! ) the man i marry, i dream, should be one who  can carry stuff like that. suits - jackets - stripes, bright colours,  everything. everytime i step into a store, there's so much interesting stuff now  in the men's stores. and my bro n dad hardly ever like to look at it. my man...  sigh sigh sigh!!      &nbsp;     -- the next day  --       sometimes, our  electricity department feels we need to be reminded that we live in india.  backward and bloody unreliable. every five words i wrote, the electricity  flickered. and then it finally went out for the xillionth  time.         &nbsp;     the good thing about  it was the reason behind the electricity problems: rain. and... hail!it was  lovely summer rain. what i live for. it fell like a sheet. there was no dodging  the raindrops yesterday. believe me, i tried. and in the gap between two  raindrops there were 10 more. raindrops. raindroppone's more like it. (english  is a poor language. i said it afore, n i say it agin).&nbsp; so .. and hail. i  inch in diameter. cold ice hail that fell on my head and face and  hands.         &nbsp;     (ha ha and hell to the  neighbours who peeped into our garden to find a 'grown 23 yrs old woman' jumping  in glee and shrieking with pleasure!!)

      yes, that's how far the enthusiasm kicked me. if i were to post an update on the myriad projects i intended to work on, i'd have to  doob maro  in  chullou bhar paani  (that is, drown n die in a gulpful of water - literal translation) because i haven't gotten anywhere.   all i did manage was to convince g'dad to buy himself a new AC and donate his old one to my proposed yoga room. the thing with the yoga classes is that i realised how little i know. what i do know about my own body and muscles, and how to relax, i don't know how to convey that in an authoritarian enough manner to sound authentic. i am going round and round. i do see how other people around me are not conscious about their bodies, posture, breathing etc. it's not like i'm perfect, but at least i am aware of it. and i want to be able to share it with them. i don't know if it's wrong, or a vice - i don't know if the others feel offended by it, but if someone spells it wrong, i have to correct it. if someone pronounces it wrong, i have to point it out. if someone breathes wrong, i have to tell them how.. it's a compulsive nature. someone has to tell me if it's normal. it's the same thing with some other people, they go over and straighten a painting on the wall, or adjust the flower arrangement, turn the angle of something to the sunlight..   so that's the secret of my insecurities about whether i'll ever be able to handle a yoga class. at the root lies an experience: my friend - who runs a gym - saif (saif!! how that word cheers me up! ::mad mad mad::) said i could take her saturday yoga/stretching class. and it didn't really go very well. as in, i was just about doing the normal stretches, none of the 'asana' things. none of the yoga thing. i think it's all in the presentation.. ::ponders::  at the root of the non-painting stint which has been lasting forever.. laziness. i finally have found a pencil sketch i want to do. copying a temple picture from a postcard. sigh yes, originality of idea: rock bottom. but, talking about it reminds me that i CAN do it. it's not all that tough. at least i won't have to deal with colours. -- which brings me to a primal fear: i think i am colour blind. so there. today is a day for confessions!  i spoke to the TeaBagLady today. she mentioned my cousin who's shifted into their apartment / PG.. and did we bitch. again, did we bitch! i spent at least 10 minutes talking about how dumb, how slow, how unlikeable, how lazy, how closed and how limited someone could be. and how.on.earth.someone:namely cousins' mom:compare.her.to.me - WORLDS APART is how TBL said it. "you're the north pole, and she's the south pole, no beyond." is how she put it. and there, gentlemen and even gentler ladies (as said the boringly enthusiastic loud man at the rotary club), there the case rests.  so goodnight blog dear. and good night whatever loyal readers i still have! i still hope i have.. (i've been pretty dead on the blogging scene of late. someday, i promise myself, someday, i'll write a daily thing like  urlLink he  does. some day!)

                     my maternity leave (as sunil put  it) has lasted longer than i meant it to.&nbsp;it's a little over a week since i  put in a post.. and i'm feeling lousy about it. meanwhile so much has been  happening. im afraid i haven't got the time to catch up on it all..        &nbsp;     first things  first:  THEY'RE BACK! yeah yeah! my parents are back. and have been with  me now for over a week. how awesome is that!! it was lovely. their train got  here dot on time. (2 mins before schedule, rather) and i was there dot on time  to recieve them. them with their lots of suitcases. no changes in them all. the  same mama papa that i'd said tata to long long back. i was so happy, delighted,  relieved, glad, and every other nice thing in the world. now mom's back to her  work. she spoils me. i don't have to spend that much time in the office. i spend  all my mornings walking to the golden temple, gymming and wasting time. i also  spend some time with her.. in the workshop.       &nbsp;    that apart, she lovvvvvvved the  work i'd done :D awesme feeling. and my manager gave a nice report of me to her.  that i worked hard. spent a lottof time in the workshop everyday. took care. and  that -- sigh. awesome awesome!       &nbsp;     other - maybe - interesting  news  is that mr.consultant has become regular at calling up. for  therecord: mr.C has entered the picture as the friend of a friend. started  talking to him coz he was planning a trip to pondi. and then .. chatting  continued. the other day i was talking to my friend, and realised it'd been over  a year since i'd been talking to mr.C . and the story goes thus (facts first)  that he chats with me only when he is bored. during his exchange prog, he was  lonely. so he chatted. now in ahd, he gets lonely in the evening so he calls up.  sadly enough i don't seem to be able to talk to him .i feel dumb and  inarticulate. don't know what to say. somehow the conversation seems pretty one  sided. and this is quite a mutual feeling. he, infact, brought up this point in  a recent record length conversation. and i had to explanation. the accuation  went thus: and u have now gathered enough trivia about me to fill an entire  volume. and i know nothing about you.      &nbsp;    so tell me dear friends, what can i  talk about to him. he's travelled half the world (in the last year alone). he is  interested in 'fun'. god knows how i can relate to that. he thinks im limited in  my expression - or whatever.. and i know i'm limited in my exposure and  experiences. if i start talking about the pet dog i might soon get, he starts  tlaking about all the dogs he sawin germany, and all the dogs he wished had  since the age of 5. well, that's something not everyone would know about him.  but he's pretty yappy. so im sure that getting him to share stuff about himself  is not all that great an accomplishment. problem = don't know what to talk about  to him. when i last started discussing relationship issues about expectations  and misunderstandings, he couldn't relate. i can't talk about my work. the only  things i do talk about are very personal issues, regarding me, my family or my  friends. how can i even begin to share the whole perspective with someone else?  not only would it be unfair on my behalf, it would be practically impossible to  give him the context of my sob stories.       &nbsp;    in a very very very weird and  pathetic way, for just one tiny TINY fraction of a fraction, i wished i could  find someone like pk. at least there was no trouble relating to him at all.        &nbsp;     a HUG OF CONGRATULATIONS  and many happy feelings:      miss.TeaBagLady has now got through  her college of choice. the College of Arts. a biiiiig hug goes out to her. even  though i know she doesn't read this. the feeling's out there in the cosmos with  her name on it. may she get it when she needs it most!      &nbsp;    i'm going on a 'pilgrimage' this  weekend. walking up a hill to a temple and all that. for all i know it might be  raining. and there have been reports about mudslides. so people, pray for me.  and when i return, please keep some advice handy. and do do remember that i've  never even met mr.C.
