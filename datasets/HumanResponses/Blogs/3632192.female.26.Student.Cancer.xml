       It is said that the Buddha was reluctant to accept images of himself, as he did not like to be venerated as a person. To symbolise the Buddha, in the very early art, one can find the Eight Spoked Wheel and the Bodhi Tree as symbols for the Buddha. The Eight-Spoked Wheel, or 'Dharmachakra' (Sanskrit) symbolises the Buddha's turning the Wheel of Truth or Law (dharma = truth/law, chakra = wheel). It relates to the story that shortly after the Buddha achieved enlightenment. The Buddha is known as the Wheel-Turner: he who sets a new cycle of teachings in motion and in consequence changes the course of destiny. The Dharmachakra has eight spokes, symbolising the Eight-fold Noble Path, and in the centre are 3 swirling segments, which represent the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. It can also be divided into three parts, each representing an aspect of Buddhist practice; the hub (discipline), the spokes (wisdom), and the rim (concentration). (http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/general_symbols_buddhism.html) The “'Dharmachakra” has been a great influence in my life. When I was a kid and living in my school hostel, the head matron sent us to the Buddhist temple to practice Buddhism.  Decipline was taught to me and my fellow Buhhist friends by the monks at the temple, teaching us how to respect yourself and then others.  Decipline is also taught in the prayers which is in Sanskrit.. The five main deciplines are refrain from destroying living creatures, refrain from taking that which is not given,  refrain from sexual misconduct, refrain from incorrect speech, refrain from intoxicating liquors and drugs which lead to carelessness. Even though it is hard strictly obey the five percepts, I make an effort to abide by it.  There might be occasions where I have lied, or killed bugs or even had wine. But I believe that if you try to follow the five percepts it helps to discipline yourself.   I have meditated in several occasions to improve my concentration and wisdom.  Meditating is not easy as I have a hard time staying in one place.  But I can assure it helps to concentrate in studies and think calmly when you are mad.  My wisdom is yet to be gained.  Because I believe we never stop learning in life.  Lord Buddha gained his achievements through great sacrifices in his life.  I know I can never come to Lord Buddha’s stage of life, but his teachings have made me who I am now.

      “An old man turned ninety-eight  He won the lottery and died the next day……” isn’t this “ironic”? Yes, I like Alanis Morissette’s songs.  I like the music she plays and mostly the lyrics which make great sense.  I love to listen to her music because she has the talent to write her lyrics connecting to real world issues.  There are some days when you just feel so down for no reason and this is when I mostly listen to her songs. Because it makes me wonder about various things which will never occur to me at all.  It makes me think it is not only me who is feeling like this or I am not only the one who goes through situations.  Ironic is the best!!!  I don’t like techno that much but I like this one song “Northern Lights” by Enigma .  I like to listen to this when I am playing a computer game or when I go to the gym. The beat itself hits right to your head that it feels like riding a trailer on a highway.      Also I like songs by Five for fighting and my favorite is “Superman”.  It is hard to live according to everyone’s expectations.  I guess all of us go through the phase of trying to satisfy someone’s dream.  The lyrics say  “It may sound absurd...but don't be naive Even Heroes have the right to bleed, I may be disturbed...but won't you concede, Even Heroes have the right to dream, It's not easy to be me ….” .  The music is soothing to listen to, when you are stressed out with school work and   other things.

      Culture includes language, behavior, music, writings, art, clothing, food and many more which we cannot describe in one word. Although in “What is culture?” the author generalize the definition culture by stating it is “learning”, which I think is a reasonable definition. If we take behavior for an example, as humans we are trained to behave in a way that our culture has taught us.  Humans’ thinking capacity is more developed than any other species; therefore we tend to act in a way that resembles our culture.  But this could defer from borders of a nation, states, region or a city.   I was disappointed by the term “high culture”.  It said that “Generally, the most powerful members of a society are the ones who have the most influence over cultural meaning systems, and therefore the more powerful classes tend to enjoy the privilege of defining high culture”.  It breaks down the value of culture.  I don’t think culture should be divided into classes.  Culture could be different but it doesn’t mean that it needs to be ranked.  This is where all the disputes amongst cultures begin.  No individual wants to be discriminated for their cultures.  Culture is a way of adapting to a certain environment and as Montesquieu said it should be "To render an intelligent being yet more intelligent!”. I like how Raymond William has interpreted culture.  It makes more sense.  He states “Every human society has its own shape, its own purposes, its own meanings”. He talks about observations and meanings which we put into practice in our everyday life.  Humans are not perfect, they lean by their mistakes, observations and experiences.  All this happen within a culture and the culture can be improved by learning from experience.  I guess not only humans have a culture but even animals do.  Culture is ordinary not only to humans but also to animals.    Geertz argues that culture is "public because meaning is"--systems of meaning are necessarily the collective property of a group”. Most people are not diversed enough to accept other cultures, because they live in their own worlds and cultures and wouldn’t open up to the fact that there are other cultures around them.  This makes them totally ignorant.  Learning is the best way to overcome this unawareness.  Acceptance is not a must but respect is, therefore if humans respect each other’s cultures and learn from their mistakes it wouldn’t have been this bad to live on earth. If humanity is preserved by culture then our goal of been perfectionists have been achieved.

       .   “Bend it like Beckham” is about an immigrant family from India to the United Kingdom and the movie emphasizes the clash between traditional values and culture.  Jessminder (Jess) loves David Beckham, the Soccer star from Manchester.  But her orthodox Sikh parents are totally against not only for been a fan of Beckham but her talent in Soccer.  Jess and her sister have grown up crossing borders and cultures and they have learnt to negotiate with the current culture in Britain. A community can have similarities between its neighboring communities.  Therefore, Sri Lankan culture and traditions are similar to its northern neighbor India.  Women have been segregated from many activities in a community.  In my community a woman’s role would be cooking, cleaning the house, looking after children and etc.  I see this in the movie “Bend it like Beckham” too.  Jess’s mom always “nags” her daughters about cooking “Aloo” (potatoes) and “Chapatties” (bread).  I think if a woman has a talent for something then she should improve on it by practicing it.  But Jess’s dad understood about her talent and the stress she went through as he was also unfairly treated when he was good at cricket. He was shunned by the British Cricket team because he was wearing a turban (a head dress).  Weddings in India last for two weeks.  The movie showed some of the events of the wedding with women dressed up in their best “Saris” and men in their “Kurtas” and turbans.  One event was very amazing to watch.  It was the wedding reception where everyone was dancing to the beat of drums. Celebrations are the best thing in the Southeast Asian cultures.  They are colorful, brightly decorated and musical.  It doesn’t matter if you are old or young; everyone dances and has a nice time. “Guru Nanayak” plays a major part in many Indian families.  Jess’s report card was opened after praying to the “guru” for better results.  This reminded of my mother, who is very superstitious and religious.  She would have an auspicious time for me to go out of the house for an exam.   My culture is based more social than individual. One couldn’t pass without been noticed by relatives and friends.  “Gossip” is the disease for my culture back in Sri Lanka.  I could relate when Pinky’s (Jess’s sister) in-laws sees Jess and Jules (The English girl), hugging each other at the bus stop and they thought that Jess was hugging a white boy.  Therefore they called off the wedding.  People don’t judge you by your own actions but by someone else’s actions.   Even though the cultures continue to clash, I guess it is all about understanding and respecting each other’s values, culture and traditions. Living in different communities helps to preserve your own culture and values.

      Does “place-making” play a major role in preserving your culture? and how far will it go to prevent disputes amongst people?  Since most people lack the experience of diversity, wouldn’t understanding different territories help people to understand each other better?  The author states that one of the three things that territoriality regulate is social interaction.  But isn’t territorial behavior the main cause for wars and conflicts amongst each other?

      1.	Does voice always have to reflect your character?  2.	When it comes to expressing yourself, why does talking seem much easier than writing?  3.	Is wiring like marketing? Where you promote yourself to a certain audience? Is there a target? 4.	If writing is done through someone’s perceptions, how do you keep the reader on the track and not bore him/her? Does the writer have to exaggerate on his/her views?

       Cancer kills over thousands of people in the world.  Cancer affects a person when abnormal cells within a tissue of a certain part of the human body continue to divide with no control.  Since many types of cancer exist, anyone at any age has a risk of being diagnosed.  In “My family has cancer”, Oswaldo’s nightmares started when he was three years old when his father died of cancer.  Now Oswaldo and his daughter Lara are going through the same nightmares.  I could relate to his story because my grandmother had cancer and it took only three months for her to leave us.  Oswaldo states about the medicine that can be aggressive against the illness, with appalling side effects.  I have seen my grandmother totally changing her appearance with no hair, red blisters all over her feet, hands and her skin as grey as it can get.   She could not walk as she was confined to bed with all tubes around her.  She couldn’t recognize anyone.  I could see the pain in her eyes, and she couldn’t talk.  There were only two nurses for the whole ward.  The nurses would avoid the patients as they didn’t want to see their pain. The cancer hospital in Sri Lanka is run by the government, therefore it lacks lots of funds, resulting few beds, staff, doctors, medicine and etc.  When I was visiting my grandmother there would be people lying on the floor and there was one time the patient next to my grandmother’s bed has passed and only a sheet covered the body.  This was a pathetic scene.  Cancer is like a queue to be stayed in to sign your death sheet.  Visiting the hospital made me feel so lucky to be healthy, although I was manipulated by the fear on when cancer is going to hit me.  Oswaldo says the same thing about people who do not want to face reality.  He also mentions how some people might not want to see the pictures of his wife posted on the web, because they do not want to see the truth.  I agree with his statement, because people do not think of unexpected circumstances that could happen to them.  They would just worry about money, positions in life, power and all the materialistic stuff they could gain.  It is natural to think about climbing a hill and not climbing down a hill.  But life is so unpredictable and anything could happen at any time.  Today, people worry about changing their self-appearances by doing all sorts of operations such as silicon implants, liposuction, and many more makeovers. I sometimes wonder why? Is this all happening because lack of love?    We should be thankful for just being alive. Life is a hike with hills to climb up and down.  No one should waste time by feeling low about oneself and regretting what you have done in the past. The world and life is too beautiful to waste.  Because you would never know when you would be hit by a dreadful disease like cancer, and be in that queue of suffering.  All we could do is hope for the best and live life.

       .   I went to an “Anglican” girl’s school. Since my dad worked for a tea plantation, my parents lived out of the capital, which will be like 5 hours drive from the capital. Therefore, from the age of four I was in my school hostel for thirteen years.  I still have memories at the Bishop’s college hostel.  It was 1983 when I first went to the hostel.  I was the youngest out of all girls in the hostel.  The halls were divided into age groups. Age 4-5 hall was called  the “baby dorm”. I can’t remember any exact situations during my stay at the baby dorm, but I do remember everything from “Arc angel’s dorm” (Age 6-12) and “St.John’s” (Age 13-16). The halls are wooded floors, and the beds are lined up separated with a locker for each individual.  We all had the same colored (green) bed spreads, provided by the school. Rule number one was not to sit on the bed while the bed-spread is on.  Yes, it was definitely strict with rules and regulations.  We had to get up at 5.30 am for the bell that rings just on time, and the sound would just pierce through the ears.  After getting ready there would be a 15 minute prayer time. We had separate rooms for the Christians, Buddhist, Hindu and Muslims.  6.30 am is breakfast time. I always looked forward for the food.  The menu was same for each day of the week.  So we would know what is for Mondays, Tuesdays and so on.  No, we couldn’t rush to the dining room. We had to line up according to the age group and go to  the “refectory”.  Even though some of us were not Christians we had to sing the grace before we sat down to eat.  Everyone had to use cutlery provided, no using fingers (Most Sri Lankans use the hand to eat), because that would mean cleaning up the table and laying the table for the next meal.  If we wanted more food, we had to raise our hand and ask for it.  We were given half and hour to finish up and then a bell would ring and everyone had to finish eating and sing the grace again.  We were not supposed to take any food from the refectory. I would never forget the moment, when my friend (Surangi) tried to steal bread and go pass the matron and she ran behind her.  Surangi ran as fast as she could, but she was stopped by the principal and she was punished for breaking the rules. From that day onwards, Surangi was known as the “paan hora” (bread-thief).   Since, we had boarded floors, it was scary at night.  There were stories about ghosts, as the hostel was like 150 years old.  The rumor was that the hostel was a hospital before it was a school. Because we did have hospital like beds and the halls looked like wards.  There were stories like that at certain nights a nurse would push a trolley counting all the patients.  And this nurse had a candle and she would wear white.  This really freaked me out.  The scariest part was hearing footsteps.  One Saturday night I was having trouble sleeping.  I was tossing and turning when I heard the “footsteps”.  It sounded like someone wore high healed shoes and was walking up and down the hallway.  I couldn’t breathe.  My eyes were hurting after squeezing them so hard. I would never forget that day.   	School starts at 7.30 am and goes on till 1.30 pm.  Right after school we would have lunch and then we would have a rest period till 3.30pm and then the same bell would screech for tea time.  After tea it’s play time which is one my favorites.  I was with a small clique of 10 and we would have our own little games, hide and seek, hopscotch, “one-two-three bumble bee” and so many more fun games.  Well next bell was for “prep” time.  I dreaded it so much. Two hours of silence and glued to the books was not fun.  But after that it was diner time and then “shower” time to get ready for bed.  We were allowed to watch TV for half and hour and that would be news.   Bishop’s College hostel was the best time of my life.  I have gone through tears, laughter and every possible feeling that a person could go through.  Learning how to get a long with various people from different backgrounds, abiding by the rules, learning to respect teachers and each other was some of the things I learnt.

       In Conclusion of Homeland Dale Maharidge talks about that America needs hope and economic elevation to overcome this time of depression. He states that America needs to limit its trade with other countries that would more opportunity to the locals.   But isn’t this the time for globalization?  Shouldn’t all countries inter-connect to make the world one big village? It might cause some kind of elevation in job opportunities, but then would it be more productive? People expect to be paid more to lead a “comfortable life”. But with higher salaries the companies itself would face financial problems.  I think the government should have a better budget planning.  The government should be more people concerned than concerned about their own benefits.

       The war in Iraq is taking a different turn, changing the minds of people in the US, and other countries as well.  It has affected America not only economically but also politically.  I believe the government of America should take steps towards solving this war on terror with clear targets.  I feel the war is like a “game” where the spectators comment on the players by sitting on their seats, commenting how the players should play.   It is true that a war will crumble down the economy in a country. This is where the president and his administration should take steady steps to be more specific on their regulations.  Instead of been a “dictator” and forcing rules on people of the country, I think Bush should be more concerned about the people and their concerns.  America has gone through a lot during the past couple of years and people seem to be frustrated with everything.  The standard of living has gone down due to low paid jobs, loss of business and many more.   Now I understand why the “Patriot Act” is opposed by many Americans.  Liberty is America, and now with this Patriot Act and its constant changing of the constitution has aggravated many people.  I feel the Patriot Act is like one of the reality shows where the act is like the live camera, waiting to busts someone for some so called “terrorist act”,  be it drugs or taking off a  man t-shirt in public.    If the US government is so worried about the country and its people then they should stop acting like the spectators of the game and start playing in the game.

       Does anyone have any clue how hard it is to get a student visa to the U.S? Well, let me explain the procedure. First an application has to be faxed to the U.S embassy and the reply may come maybe in 3 weeks or longer. But if they “suspect” anything you don’t have the opportunity even to be interviewed.  Once a date is sent through fax for an appointment, we have to go stand in a line from 6 am.  They take you in at 8 am and then you go through a security check.  After the body search and everything, you sit and wait till you are called.  First you have to pay USD 100 to process the application and IF you pass the interview then you pay another USD 96 for the visa issuance.  Well let me also tell you what sort of questions they asked me when I was interviewed. The US officer looked at my grades and then asked me how I am doing in my classes. I said “pretty good”. And then after some basic questions the closing statement was like “Well you know, we don’t want any terrorists in our country..”. I was like “sure..”.  The whole interview procedure is like a cattle show. They might even turn you inside out, just to make sure that we are not terrorists.  Is this how America treats all countries? Oh I forgot to mention the most ironic thing.  One year ago, the FBI had to make a sudden visit to Sri Lanka as two US representatives in the US embassy had issued some visas to some Pakistanis.  According to the newspapers, these US officials were bribed to issue the visas by the Pakistanis.  Anyways the FBI arrested the officials and took them back to the US.  I found this ironic because America is digging their own grave yard.  Well anyway, I hate going to the American Embassy of Sri Lanka, as I feel that it is like going to get a visa to the prison. Air ports in America are also one place where any “Arab” look-a-like doesn’t want to be in.  They go through random checks, and I have noticed I have always been chosen for the random check.  I can imagine how Anna (Book Two – Homeland) must have felt when she was chosen “randomly” for a security check.   Well, I don’t want to be biased and be lambasting the Americans. The Americans have gone through enough already.  I guess people are all tensed and more careful.  Sometimes it is just hard to understand when innocent people be the victim of the harassments.   For a fact I wouldn’t like if someone says “F*** America”.  In the story of “Book Two” it says some Arab kids were screaming cursing Americans.  And some people where happy when America was attacked. This is not fair. We are all in one world.  Why can’t people understand? If one country goes down, it has bad effects on other countries too.  I don’t understand how this world works.

       I was not interested in American politics until I started to read Dale Maharidge’s Homeland.&nbsp; It is distressing to see how the government is handling the whole issue about national security.&nbsp; I do understand the fact that people are tensed about the current situation in the U.S. But people are sacrificing their fundamental rights to national security.&nbsp; Is this the only way to find the terrorists?  The “Patriot Act” is violating everything about America (I hope I won’t get killed for saying it). When I hear the word “America”, I picture freedom.&nbsp; But today it has come to a level where Americans can’t be Americans anymore. Rights of expression, privacy and religion have been deprived from the people. Is this what the people in America voted for? Well it is true that the “terrorism” was not expected until the Towers and the Pentagon was attacked.&nbsp; But I “hear” that the government knew about this brutal act even before it occurred.&nbsp; Why didn’t the government do something about it then? &nbsp;Why did the terrorist even attack in the first place? &nbsp;I have so many questions wandering around in my mind. I hope someone can give me an unbiased answer someday…

      Until I read Katie Sierra’s story, I was under the impression only third world countries had problems like violating human rights.  It is sad to know that America “the land of opportunity and freedom” has failed to keep to its constitution.   Sometimes I wonder whether who causes for this downfall, the people or the government.  I am not sure to answer that.  But somewhere in the book says you have to go out of the country to value America.  This is true.  Only if each American had a chance to go out of America, they will start to value their country more. Because there is a  lot going on outside of America that people should see and experience. Americans always shout about “patriotism”, wearing clothes of the American flag, having flags hanging from cars, houses etc.  But are they truly patriotic? Or just showing their “patriotism” to the outside world?  Most Americans are trapped in their own worlds.  They simply can’t accept the fact that other religions, cultures exists.  I think parents, teachers and leaders should start to teach the younger generation how to respect other cultures, and to value and respect their own cultures.
