       It has become some sort of ritual nowadays; can't sleep without watching two movies. Watched "Erin Brockovich" on HBO in the night. Thought the dialoagues in the movie were fantastic. Even if it was a real-life story which should deserve a lot of sympathy, there are parts in the movie where you would wish someone could just give a whack to Julia because of the way she behaves. If that was the point that the movie intended to convey, it has done that tremendously well. Earlier, you could have seen me coming out a theater very disappointed about the movie that I had to endure - called "Murder". It's a movie in Hindi and it was remarkable how the director managed to turn the movie from being bad to bullshit in the closing stages. 

 The movie was supposed to be a sex thriller. But all it did was to help shed the inhibitions of my friend who shared with us his first sexual experience. Mind you, we are from a very conservative part of society in the place I live in. Therefore, don't get yourself excited too much. Actually, I'm brining up this because I wanted to throw light into a couple of idiosyncrasies. My friend told me that he wouldn't get excited if someone sucked on his nipples. He also shied away being at the giving end of a blowjob. Come on! How can this be possible? I am wondering if these are attractive to me because I'm queer. I hope (and I'm sure) that it's not! 

 By the way, I'm planning a trip to visit my sister. I might end up seeing her in a week from now. Another thing that I noticed today - I think I'm more comfortable being with my college friends than with those who I share common interests with eg. music. I'm really wondering why such a gigantic change is occuring to my personality.

       I went through the second half of the topsy-turvy "Pulp Fiction" to start off the day. Wow, what a movie! Great ending and it's very funny in a grave sense. But, as I have posted in another forum somewhere else on the internet, I thought the F-word and the graphic violence were accentuated to levels which ended up tainting the movie. As I began searching online for great movies to watch, I stumbled upon JRR Tolkien's epic; Lord of the Rings. A few days back my dear friend, who's is an avid reader, suggested that I should read the book before I watched the movies. 

 I was very anxious to get my hands on the book and had to hurry through my chores to get to the library. I got the paperback monster of the book of the "trilogy" (which actually it isn't. It's supposed to be six books and indices). I visited my friend wearing the short-shirt which he had bought me from Delhi. I love the shirt. But, there is a slight problem which is confusing. The two halves of the shirt are not of equal length. The right half of the shirt is half an inch longer than it's counterpart. Is this some kind of a new fashion statement? 

 Anyway, I went to the DVD rental shop and got myself "Ben Hur". I read up about the movie online and I hope to be as thrilled as the reviews suggest. But to my disappointment, the DVD is not original. Picture and Sound qualities are far from perfect. 

 In the night, I watched the wonderful movie "The Hours" on TV. I really enjoyed the movie and was really touched by the amount of sadness depicted by the different roles. What really stuck out was the amount of home homophilia in the movie. There are three kissing scenes involving women only. There are two same-sex couples in the movie. Wowowowow, what's this? I never thought I would so much of 'gaydom' on Prime Timve television in India. 

 Things are looking really up! Or is it too early to call?

       After all the hype about the movie, I went to watch it First Day First Show. You have to admit that all these sub-plots in a movie such as this destroy it's intended moral. When you get such corny dialogues such as "I made a promise to my son. So I have to keep it.", you will start disliking what is otherwise a splendidly taken movie. But had fun watching it and will recommend it to all movie lovers. Especially the scenes involving the city of New York drowning. 

 That is two movies per day for the last three days. I felt a sense of relief earlier in the morning after finishing the last part of the Godfather Trilogy. The movie was better than what I had hoped it would be, mainly due to the unexpected twist in the ending. 

 Spent the rest of the day with a friend with the admission to his course at the college. I got rewarded by being eyed by his father later.

       Do you ever get this feeling of utter worthlesness while waiting at a hospital lobby for something to happen? Well, today it happened to me when I went to see this cousin who needed emergency Laparoscopic surgery. Okay, I'll explain why... 

 I was rudely awakened from my sleep by a call on the mobile asking me to turn up at a blood bank as a donor. I was late in getting to bed yesterday after posting at this blog etc. The donation didn't eat up too much time. I got time to get back home and get dressed for a housewarming at my friend's home. Felt really good catching up with him and his family. A wonderful house and a great lunch as well. 

 Lack of sleep, a hypersomnic lunch and the bleed must have all contributed to the fact that I felt rotten during the 4 hours I had to spend waiting at the hospital. Besides, I was being bored to death by a dull conversation with the aforementioned cousin's hubby. The only good thing about this - got to stare at a few hot older men! 

 I had to lie to get out of the hospital. I took a nap in my friend's room at the hostel. Came back home and watched the rest of the Godfather 2 movie. The nights are becoming more boring as they have taken a couple of my favorite shows off the prime time. "Caroline in the City" and "Will and Grace" have both been replaced by "Mad TV" which doesn't match up to their standards. 

 By the way, any one reading my posts?

      I have a few problems in my life. If someone wanders on to this page and has a suggestion, I would be very glad to hear it.
 
 I have crushes on a) A Professor at College b) A friend's father. What do I do about them?
 I have 'come out of the closet' to a few friends. I still have to break it to my family and a few other friends.I have to find a way move to my hostel in a far-away city. 
 I have a lot musical gear like guitars, drums etc. Oh, it's getting on my nerves...
 

Someone helpe me!

       The reason why I start blogging here is because of getting inspired by another blog ( urlLink Search for Love ). There are similarities between this blog and the one which inspired me. First of all, both deal with Gay issues. Secondly, both involve medical professional (I presume). So welcome! 

 Today was an odd day. Most of the day I spent trying to clean up my room before I start my JRship at a hospital. That was really messy. In between, I felt like writing and recording songs, watched the Godfather II DVD and caught up on some action on the tube. There is an amazingly hot man in the movie who is acting as the villain. 

 In the evening, I met a fascinating gentleman who has a splendid collection of Rock classics. I was dreaming of the day when I'll meet the gentleman with the kind of musical taste that I desire. Let's hope he comes around soon. 

 In the night, I watched a "Catch me if you can" and bits and pieces of the UEFA Champions league finals. Great movie I should say! How I wish Monaco had won! And now here I'm rounding up my first post amongst the many, hopefully, in the future.

       Finally, I've come across other blogs maintained by Indians which discuss about gay issues. Here are two which seem to be a little dormant at present. Let's hope things will liven up soon. 

 

  urlLink QueerIndia  by  urlLink Nitin Karani 
  urlLink Queer  by Praana Sakha 
And I stumbled upon a few articles about the Section 377 IPC in these blogs. 
  urlLink Sexuality and The Law  on  urlLink Frontline 
  urlLink India: Section 377: How natural is normal?  by Nivedita Menon

 

 To Nitin and Praana - I hope you will give me some much needed 2 cents on my ramblings. ;-) 

 Here is another article on another Frontline with relevance to sexual minorities in India. 
 
  urlLink India : The Sex Workers. The Story 
 

 Of particular interest to me is a little part of the article that I'm quoting below. Is this the hospital that I'm about to work in? 
 Not surprisingly, Mumbai's AIDS rate has soared in recent years. Aronson visits one of Mumbai's largest public hospitals, one of the few in India that doesn't turn away AIDS patients. There she finds a man who is well into his sickness.

       In the past couple of weeks, I have been mentioning about Crosswords. I've been searching the web for some good crossword sites. Here is the  urlLink list  and here is the best that I've come across until now -  urlLink Newsday Crossword . It gives me great pleasure to inform you that I, with Ray of course, have managed to solve one whole Crossword from the Newsday site. 

 Apart from that, I've been enjoying these hugely enjoyable, educated chat sessions with this guy named Docker from SF, USA. He is the one who ushered me into the world of MC Escher the other day. The fun thing about chatting with him is the kind of stuff that he comes up with. 

 For example, his name originated from the term 'DOCKING'. There is a new meaning for this word - In gay sex, this refers to the act of protracting one partners foreskin over the other's glans, masturbating and then finally ejaculating into the others urethras. See the picture below. 
 urlLink    The process of Docking&nbsp; urlLink   

 The act is rounded off by a nice session of 69. Docker, who is circumcised, finds this as the ultimate in sex. And he believes himself to be the ultimate in Docking! 

 Finally, I've found a reason why I should find fellatio so attractive. The reason is pretty straightforward. And it is from Docker himself. Here goes - 
 "Remember that if men were not meant to be sucked, their bodies wouldn't have come with a nozzle!" - Docker 
 Doesn't this sound way too logical? For me, yes! And to take to my craze to another level, I went through this site, which incidentally was discoverd by Ray, which features a fellatio tutorial. Check it out here -  urlLink Fellatio Tutorial

       The agony of not hearing from your date is horrible. Especially when it is due to such trivial reason - the computer guy sustained a freak injury which delayed the formatting an installation of the OS in Mr. Lion's computer. But after 3 days, I've had an e-mail with the preceding information which lessened the pain a little. 

 The agony of having to do something I hate is excruciating. Especially when the the aetiology is hopelessly shallow. Most of my relatives want to use me as their own personal doctor who could give them advice, which they could otherwise obtain, with a huge loss of money of course, from Cardiologists, Neurologist, Anaesthetics, Neurosurgeons, Infertility Experts etc. And I hate that. Why can't they ever try to understand what I would like to be talked to? 

 The agony of not being able to enjoy sex because of preputial stenosis, or in even easier terms "True Phimosis", is horrible. When you decide that you have to get cut, a dozen well-meaning Dads on  urlLink SilverDaddies.com , who are willing to go to any lengths to coaxe you to retain your couple of centimeters of skin, make you re-think. Their reasons are varied. Most center on the fact that prepuce is a blessing which you can't discard at will. Others argue that it is painful, causes decreased sensations etc. Now I'm going to try conservative methods after consulting a Urologist. If that don't work out, I'll try the radical method. Try this sit out if you have time -  urlLink http://www.nocirc.org  

 The agonies of being unable to master CSS, of not getting a JRship with pay, of not yet finding a new home for my dog, of suspecting my friends about their committment towards me etc. are being obscured by the aforementioned ones. 

 Well, if there is so much agony in my life, why am I not even crying? I'm not the kind of macho man who would waste a tear for fear of losing masculinity. Maybe my pain-control "Gate" mechanisms are state-of-the-art. Or maybe I'm hallucinating. Or maybe I'm just too cool.

       This post was meant to appear two days before. Thanks to my great ISP which can't figure out how to solve a local cable problem in under than 48 hours. 
 
 Yesterday was another special day. Ray celebrated his birthday with Mr. Lion in bed. It was the best possible birthday present that he could ever have I guess. Both enjoyed every moment of their time together. The day before, both were being apprehensive about how things would work out. And I, being the pimp, did my best to reassure them. I think it worked marvelously well. 

 To put things in perspective, Ray had sex with the man I’m almost in love with and I am still feeling great about it. It must be something to do with us being insane because this kind of thing works out only in porn movies or fantasies. But the truth is, we are very happy ‘sharing’ the treasure that we have found from this desert for gays. And as I quote Karen from ‘Will and Grace’; “It is like finding a needle in a gay-stack”, I’m feeling proud about our friendship. 

 To celebrate things, we two decided to try our luck at another crossword, from another newspaper, hoping that things would be easier. To give you an idea how committed I’m to improve myself in this, I bought an Oxford Advanced Learner’s dictionary before we headed off to the beach with the newspaper. As things unfolded, we realized that the miraculous transformation in our skills, which the dictionary seemed to guarantee, was not going to happen yesterday. 

 Ray’s vocabulary is simply amazing compared to the average ordinary educated Indian graduate, thanks to about 10 years of voracious reading since high school. Mind you, even with that, these crosswords are being very difficult. I suggested Ray to give a shot at writing; even in a blog like this. But he says he is not yet good enough and that the knack of writing is something he doesn’t have. I hope he changes his mind, and the sooner he does it, the better. 

 Yesterday, I thought I went overboard trying to explain how lucky I was feeling after finding men of such quality on Silverdaddies.com. I am forced to continue doing so, as I found out yesterday, that a man that I’m chatting with is ultra-cool. I’m referring to Docker, again from Silverdaddies.com who is an artist/professor by his own right. He has worked with an amazing artist/painter/writer called M. C. Escher during the latter’s lifetime. And now, he is the proud owner of a collection of the works of Mr. Escher which is second only to the one found in a Washington Museum! 

 As pointless it is, of me, to point out that I’m feeling onerous at this moment about this, M. C. Escher’s work is very interesting. You can check out some of the impossibilities in his featured paintings. I’m not even scratching on the surface of this great artist’s work, but I feel special having added a bit of knowledge into my own brain about art in general, and him in particular. 

 Yet another gentle-mature-man from the US was kind enough to let him read his article on a magazine that he writes in. Very entertaining read indeed, it turned out to be. 

 See, this is what I love about older men. They seem to be more wise, more creative, more intense, more knowledgeable, more powerful, more ‘everything else that you can think of’ than younger men and of course, any kind of women. My infatuation should be self-explanatory now. 

 I’m now in touch with about 10 different older men over the internet from the US, Canada, UK and Australia. Most of them have hit on me at SilverDaddies.com and seem to be very interested in me. I chat with them and enjoy flirting with them, even with the feeling in the back of my mind that I might be cheating on them. Is there any other way of going about this that the generous reader might suggest? 

 Out of these 10 odd persons, 4 have offered me unimaginable luxuries if I were to fly over and start living with them. How and why should they be so generous, I may never understand. But I’m feeling uneasy about these offers. Sometimes I feel like a part of the flesh-trade. There are times, when I remember a friend of mine friend saying that “An older man wanting to have a relationship with you might be a pedophile.” Even other times, I feel that I’m being a fool rejecting such great offers. I can assure you that rejecting them takes a great amount of will power. 

 I was chatting with an American Silverfox who enjoys international soccer. He likes watching the players and I enjoy watching the coaches. It suddenly occurred to me that just about everything I do in life these days is related to getting closer to an older man. Although this has been a blessing to me because such an urge made me improve myself as a person, it’s time I got a hold on it.

       I don't know if anyone is keeping a track on gay blogs for the past 2 days, especially those from New York. The main event featured in these blogs is a broadway musical called  urlLink That's SO Gay: Tales of Extremely Gay Gayness . My godfather in blogging, FAUSTUS MD, performed a gay cabaret song which he himself had written. From the comments on his blog you can be pretty sure that he did a great job. Now, Faustus actually went on to describe, on his blog, a few facts about his life which, he thought, made him gayer than most other gay people. Having thought I had read enough about gayness for a day, I went through another blog called  urlLink Evelasting Blogstalker  by a man who calls himself  urlLink Charlie . Found out even more about extreme gayness. 

 Ergo, my self-doubting alter-ego took center stage. How gay am I? I don't dress like gays. I don't walk poodles or matisse around. In fact, my dog can be considered as a 'bisexual' kind of dog. She isn't either too masculine or feminine. I don't frequent the gyms nor am I a particularly well built person. Okay, I adore boxer trunks! But very few people know that I'm actually gay. But I'm sure I'm gayer than most other gay persons. It's just that I don't go around splashing it all over myself. Maybe it's because I'm in India. Maybe it's because of the way I'm. Whatever it is, I'm very comfortable with it. 

 I may not be the gayest person alive. But I'm one of the geekiest persons to hail from my neck of the woods, I'm sure. Yesterday, I managed to get invited to 3 G-mail accounts from a source I wouldn't like to divulge because I value their privacy. Now, most persons around me don't even know what G-mail is. If that was not geeky enough, I actually spent the whole day migrating to these accounts from my current Yahoo accounts. My initial review gives 8 out of 10 to G-mail. The problems with the interface and slackness with attachments etc. seem to be problems that can be sorted out in the alpha version. 

 On a different beat, I talked for a long time with Chuck. We sorted things out. He has promised not be this creepy again. He actually wanted to hear all about my encounters with Mr. Lion. And I, as you might have expected, confided in him like a little pre-teen girl. I can assure you he was feeling like throwing up the enjoyable Punjabi food that we were having at a restaurant when this happened. But he still listened to me. He put forward his opinions. And he, mind you, is absolutely straight. And that is why I think he's cool. 

 I don't know if I'm the latest casanova on a site that I'm registered in ( urlLink SilverDaddies.com ), but I'm getting a lot of proposals from older men from all over the world. One of them, of special mention, is a very well known person (who is known as Skip  ) in the sporting circles in Australia. He is a charming, funny, enthusiastic man who actually carried the Olympic torch when it went through Sydney. And he likes me very much. So much so, that he has actually invited me to come to Sydney for watching a summer test match at  urlLink  the SCG  with complete hosting and entertainment from his side. 

 I told Chuck about this. And you should have seen his jaw hit the table to create a minor dent that would go unnoticed with the restaurant owner. He asked me “What’s happening to the world these days? Don’t straight guys have any chance at all?” Coming to think of it, he might be right. Look at me. I live in a conservative society which is orthodox and where, being gay is ridiculed. But, I’m seeing someone, enjoying a sex life and finding great persons from all over the world. And Chuck, he’s not doing any of these at the moment. Straight persons, as someone said, must be out of their minds! 

 I'm rounding this post off on a sad note on behalf for those who follow English soccer. Yesterday's game was breath-taking. But Portugal did give England the kind of fight that would at least, bring in some respect to the English defeat yesterday. And for da Wayne, he, in my opinion, will be good enough to be a force for at least a decade. And we will see more of him, talk more about him and raise his iconic status even further.

        urlLink Epistemology : Epistemology(Noun) 

 Pronunciation: [ê-pis-tê-'mah-lê-jee or -ji] 

 Definition 1: (Philosophy) The study of the nature of knowledge: suppositions, conclusions, and all that happens in between—how we know things; the structure of knowledge itself. 

 Very interesting word. Something like a fact about fact. I thought I'll share the word with you. Another new word usage that I came across today is 'acme'. Someone told congratulated me on reaching my acme. Well, I'd rather think that I've never reached acme and am striving for it. Keeps the drive going. Some of you may have realized, my life's peaking right now. But I am hoping that this is not the highest that it can ever reach. 

 I'm trying to don my Power Personality mode these days. Appearing confident about everything that I speak about. That can sometimes be deceiving to unsuspecting persons. Today, at the marriage ceremony that I had to attend, I had a few persons sermon me after hopelessly misunderstanding me. Check this out. I was having some fun with my uncle who I always enjoy having lively, humorous conversations with. I said "In four years time, I'll be one of the  most-wanted Orthopedicians in town. I should be very busy and hard to reach.". The man behind me, my father's cousin, pulled himself up from the slumber in a chair and said gravely to my ear "Whatever you do, always do something to help out the poor. Never let yourself be a money-machine who doesn't care about people. This is my advice to you." Escuse me! I was just kidding. I am one of the proponents of the doctrine that my father's cousin preached. 

 Chuck had called me when I was at the wedding. I said that I was disappointed that he didn't inform me where he went. He explained that he thought I would want to come if he had informed me. Since there was not enough space in the car, he thought I will feel disappointed. Excuse me! I'm 24! I can understand when someone says no to something. Especially if it's for such a valid reason. He said sorry finally. But I need to talk to him about what he thinks of me.

       I guess most of you bloggers must be aware of the G-mail theory. 1 (whopping) GB of space with a little string attached: Context sensitive text ads. For all that I figured, I thought they might not be good. Life has a habit of proving me wrong these days, but only for the better. Check the top of my blog out. You see the banner ad saying " urlLink Indiana Jones " or " urlLink Sean Connery "? I'm very impressed. Apart from Mr. Lion, Mr. Connery is the only man I've been dreaming about. I'm waiting with baited breath until I get hold of his biography from the  urlLink The British Library . 

 Apart from the my dating dilemas,  urlLink Euro 2004  is happening too. I bring this point up as the first person to comment on my blog is a big time soccer fan. I too am a soccer fan. Coincidence? I too support England. Coincidence? I too root for  urlLink Rooney, Wayne ! Not a coincidence! Not in any bloody way. And the answer to that is because he's on top of the world at this moment. People from all over the world are comparing him to Pele. Well, that might be a little premature. But this kid is good, I tell you! I hope he keeps up the magic and get England their first major title since 1966. 

 Oh by the way, Mr. Lion is happy to see me more often. I'm relieved. I'm happy and am gay. I'm expecing an explanation from Chuck today.

       Life gets weirder. First of all, FAUSTUS MD, the man who inspired me (with the blog  urlLink The Search for Love in Manhattan ) to create this blog, replied to mail saying that he enjoyed my style of writing. Great! Mr. Lion gave me and Ray a wonderful tour of the zoo. It also featured close encounters with tigers which is what I have always fantasized about! Everything about Mr. Lion is infatuating! Ray finally agreed to my earlier descriptions about the man. Mr. Lion and Ray were meeting for the first time and now they are going to meet again in about three days’ time. 

 Now, you must be confused about the picture. I’m dating Mr. Lion. I along with Ray go see Mr. Lion. Mr. Lion is making plans with Ray. It’s not a complicated love triangle. I and Ray can’t figure out why we are doing this. But the truth of the matter is that it’s very hard to find any SilverFox in this part of the world, forget someone like Mr. Lion! And therefore, we are okay with Mr. Lion seeing both of us at the same time. 

 Back to cloud 1. I want to see Mr. Lion more often. Not for sex always. Just to share some time between us. I don’t know if Mr. Lion is game for it. I’ve sent him a mail asking him if he would be interested. I hope he says yes. 

 What would you do if your best friend did something like going to a hill station without telling you? What if the reason for him not informing might be that he is scared that you might want to go along with him to the tour? Chuck is doing this to me now. But I’m fine with it. I’m not that easy to convince against in such situations.

       Yesterday was a wonderful day in my life. I should admit that I was feeling very happy after my first date "in Bed". Even though I was able to please Mr. Lion (to an extent I think I have), some sort of nervousness hidden in me prevented me from enjoying the reciprocation. 

 So, feeling wonderful I was; but also feeling rather anxious about not hearing from Mr. Lion. Finally, he responded in the afternoon saying that it was nice experience blah blah. I wanted to chat with him somehow. It didn’t materialize yesterday and not until now. In the back of my mind I was feeling undecided whether to go to Delhi or to join my college as volunteering intern. Plus, I haven’t decided on a date yet to ‘give’ Julie to its new master. 

 Multitude of reasons made me wish there was someone with me to do something to take my mind off. I set out to see Ray who was actually busy at the hospital relieving someone. I met him in the intensive care unit and learnt something that I have always wanted to learn. How to operate the Ventilator and other monitoring devices. Ray is very good at explaining. He’s patient and answers all your questions with disregard to the actual intelligence involved in putting together the question. 

 After that bit, I took Ray home to help me out with my website updates. Plans went awry as we found ourselves at the mercy of the games that the Kerala State Electricity Board likes to play. Mind you, it’s not even a week since they have taken off the Load-Shedding bit. The half an hour per day cuts have been generously replaced by outages in the morning which last about 2 hours. Anyway, what this meant that we had to go out and we ended up having a lot of fun. 

 To the beach we went first and spent a lot of time knowing more about each others’ past lives. It’s alarming that we should have so many similarities. We also tried solving crosswords but ended up feeling like miserable jerks when we couldn’t even find more than 4 answers out of 50. A stroll on the beach is always great for ‘silverfox-spotting’. Even though a drizzle made a decent try at stopping us from enjoying, we beat it to the new park in the cultural capital of the city. It’s an awesome place and things like this should be encouraged. Except for the loud and senseless speech about some kind of harmony between religions blaring over cheap speakers, the park too was a pleasant experience. To top things off, there was this awesome dinner at the “Punjabi Dhaba”. In a matter of a few months, this place is becoming “the” place to have food. I love the “Aloo ka Paratha” at the place. 

 Did I ever mention to *you*, the reader of my blog, that I’m feeling a bit like ‘living’ Will & Grace? If I haven’t yet, then I’m feeling like that. I have always wanted to lead a life in the way one of these sitcoms portray it. Look I’m gay. I’m seeing someone. I have a friend Ray who is gay. I have someone like Chuck and May who know practically everything about me. Great friends, gay friends and an active sex life; Wait a minute! Isn’t this Will & Grace without all the jokes? 

 Among the things that me and Ray have been talking about, one thing that I would like to write about is about the relationship with parents. Ray had the opinion that I’m just taking things too seriously at home. I am expecting too much from my parents while not giving what they want. I know that this is true to some extent. But then, I just wish for someone like Chuck’s parents who enjoy dining out, having fun and talk to each other more. Then again Chuck is not gay, he’s religious and does do things that his Mom and Dad want him to. Thinking about what might have been had I not been like what I am now is never going to work, is it? 

 Anyhow, I would still like to give you an example of what goes on in my house which always seems to irritate me. Today afternoon, I was feeling happy about having worked out properly for the first time after my sprain. I had gone down to have lunch keeping a happy face and feeling good. Mom and Dad are watching the Sun News channel. Mom served me the set. I thought I will watch some TV while I’m eating. I ask my father if I can watch TV for 10 minutes. 

 Dad said “You can watch TV alright. But if you don’t mind I would like to watch TV for another 10 minutes.” Mom said “Why do you ask? Have we ever prevented you from watching TV?” Both don’t look in the eye. Mom said what she did with the kind of unhappiness which depressed me. Now you might be thinking that this is normal. But when you understand that my father always says things like this without actually meaning it. He actually wanted to see TV for half an hour. If he wanted to say he would like to watch TV for half an hour, why not say that? Why should he be dishonest in this? 

 Dishonesty is one thing my father always sports. Especially when it comes to saying things like 

 
 “I know it’s there somewhere here, but can’t find it now.”  - The thing was never there.  
 “This thing is brand new. I bought it a couple of weeks back.”  - It was bought about 10 years back and it looks damn old.  
 “I have never seen the TV go as dark as it does. It was normal until today.”  - The TV has not been working properly for about 4 years now. 

 The levels of dishonesty creep up to dizzying levels when he speaks to a guest/friend. He tries to praise himself and everyone else to glory. I can’t stand that. Why can’t he be straight-forward and say the truth? 

 My Mom’s cooking is in such a way that some times the gravy and the pieces in the curries seem like separate. Now this is accentuated when the curry is hot. When she’s at home, she cooks late and at lunch everything is warm. This of course, does more harm to the curry than not because of the problem. I hate this and always ask her to cool everything down before serving. But she never seems to understand and always blames me for complaining too much. The same happened today. 

 So I’m left eating at the table munching my not-so-delectable lunch. I try to drown with my best effort. This is what goes on around me. 

 Dad’s picking on his nose. It is ugly to see how he does it. He sort of lunges back after each pick and the whole upper limb motion is very jerky. After each pick he carefully inspects what is between his fingers. If there is something appreciably large, it ends up on the floor by the couch. 

 Mom’s trying to act interested in what is going on in the TV. She makes strange faces. She has her hand inside her underskirt and she’s also picking somewhere. I can’t see properly where. 

 Seeing this, I hope to see something pleasant on TV. Surprise, surprise it’s Sun TV. They show ugly Tamilians with weird hairdos, weirder accents and even yuckier things to talk about. At times the guy on the tube talks so loud, I have to plug my ears. And even more surprising, my parents are enjoying it. After all, they aren’t watching TV! They are busy with picking at themselves. 

 It’s too much for me. I have to stop eating lunch and come up to type this. I feel so bad at not being able to adjust to these apparently trivial things at home. I hope someone finds out that this is not so easy to adjust.

       My sister finally went back. I was glad and relieved when she did because now I didn’t need to talk to her. Furthermore, she was depriving me of precious time to type mails to Mr. Lion. Hell whatever, I finally decided on meeting Mr. Lion in a hotel room and have some fun. I don't want to go into graphic description of the whole event. But it was so much fun for me. Lots of kissing, caressing, fondling went on. I gave Mr. Lion the time of his life (I hope). It was the first time I did it but I felt at home doing it. In between, we talked about a lot of things including my Sis. 

 Having said that, I was a bit disappointed that I couldn’t respond properly to what Mr. Lion had to offer. I have been thinking about the reasons why. I have concluded that it was due to the fact that I never fantasized anyone doing such things to me. I dream of me doing such things to others! Maybe a physical factor (which might need a surgical consult) was also involved. Again, I’m not detaling. 

 In the end, I feel wonderful after going through my first sexual experience. It was certainly fun. I hope to have more fun in the coming months! Thank you Mr. Lion!!!

       It did seem a little strange when I first started talking to my sister after she came home. Two years back, I was being the post-pubescent younger brother without any sense of direction in life and she used to be the mature person who had the life that she once hoped for. We shared everything between ourselves. I have been grateful to her for supporting the way she has did in letting me become what I’m now. 

 Now it’s almost the exact opposite. I am enjoying what my life the way I want with the kind of confidence that I rarely experience. She is going through one of her worst phases of her life after marrying. And she seems lost in her own castle of shattered dreams. She and I have been rarely talking for the past few months. I was feeling bad about not doing that. 

 The conversations seem to follow the same course. She explains how wonderful she’s feeling being back at home. Then goes on to say how bad her life is at her new home but how good BIL is. I try to explain to her that it’s over a year and a half and that they two have to decide on a proper strategy which would work to make her life better. She says “You don’t understand. This isn’t easy!”. 

 For three days the conversation went on in this pattern with me trying in vain to suggest that they are allowing someone to rule over them without any need for the same. Finally, I felt lost again and contacted my personal shrink, Mr. Lion. 

 Mr. Lion asked me to stop bothering my Sis and BIL with their troubles unless they demanded help. He said that me and my Sis are showing something called “Allelomimetic behaviour” which actually means group thinking behaviour. He said it’s fine just to give them support and in due course things will clear up. He also suggested the origin of my homosexual tendencies from one of my parents. He also thinks this might have rubbed on my sister. Honestly, I never thought about that! 

 This is extremely interesting. I’m in a situation where I think I have found some answers to the origins of my sexual orientation. Also, Mr. Lion has cleared up my dilema about my sister. I’m quitting from being allelomimetic with my Sis. Thank you, Mr. Lion!

       The day of my dream date with this guy didn’t start off that well. I was unsure why he wasn’t chatting with me. But apparently, MSN had to resolve issues far beyond human comprehension to get us to chat with each other. But that was not the jolt which I received in the morning. Well, ‘jolt’ probably isn’t the word that I should be using because at that point the news that my sister is arriving the day after could have meant good or bad. Anyway, I thought this might be a bad experience because of the fact that I could never explain to her why I wasn’t talking to her as much as I used to. This was shocking because I had to get everything clean and spotless before she arrived. And I had a date on in the afternoon! 

 Before I get any further, I would like to give the characters in my life with some names. So here goes; Ray – my gay friend, Chuck – my straight friend, May – my straight girl friend, Mr. Lion – my current date. These are the important characters. I’ll introduce more as the story goes on. 

 So with the new of my Sis coming, I called Ray and asked him to help me. We would discuss about the date along with cleaning. So all was said and done and I was getting ready to go to meet Mr. Lion. I logged into MSN with the hope of at least hoping to chat with him once before meeting. And there he was! Apparently he had been hoping for the same from the morning. He had a visit from a cousin. We chat for sometime and start out to meet. I decide on a set of formals. The best set I have. 

 It’s a rainy afternoon. I reach there 5 minutes before schedule and wait for him at the parking lot. He doesn’t turn up in time. I start worrying. I even called Ray up and he suggested that Mr. Lion might have waited until the rain subsided. Finally, I pick his car up and greet in and get in. Boy, he looked good! Much better than what I had expected after seeing his photo. He’s younger looking than the photo suggested. Great forearms, arms, sprinkle of silver hair sprouting through his shirt top, no shoes just sandals. Dresses smart and talks nicely. 

 Wonderful start I guess. I was feeling a bit nervous. But we started talking and things started easing out. We went to good restaurant where we hoped to get some privacy. We start off with soup and he carries on talking. He’s not having any main course cuz he had lunch already. I order a Biriyani and listen to him. 

 The conversation is about his sexual encounters in the past and his professional life. I only get time to add stuff here and there. I’m awestruck by the things that he did, the things that he knew and the stuff that he had been through. Honestly I have never realized that sex life among men from India can be this colorful. 

 As he’s talking he starts to grab at my thighs. With waiters interrupting, this never goes on properly. Finally, I start reciprocating and I’m feeling happy about what I’m doing. We never reach the ZONE because of the lack of privacy. There was this one moment where he actually felt my nipple which was so weird. But then, I am not gifted with my body; be it nipples, muscles or anything else. 

 This was pretty romantic because of the setting for the first date. I thought I liked him then. After this, we rode on his car to the place where we met and from there he took a side lane. After reaching a relatively empty part of the road, he grabbed me and kissed me. Wow, what a feeling it was! I thought I reacted well and we shared two warm kisses with tongue. In between I groped at his thing which was responding. At the end of the second kiss, Mr. Lion caught someone looking at us. We then made our way out and then came back to the parking lot. We parted after I gave him my mobile number and he gave me his business card. 

 After this, I felt on top of the world. It was my first date and I thoroughly enjoyed the kisses. I finally felt like I’m entering my adult life proper. Wow, it took about 2 hours for me to explain the whole story to Ray who was very happy about this. We came to my place and started doing the chores. It really felt wonderful having someone like Ray beside me who understood all my feelings. I called Chuck up to say that I had enjoyed the date. I promised to tell him all the details on the next jogging session. 

 One thing that really amazes me is the number of good qualities that this guy has. He’s almost my dream guy. Intelligent, educated, handsome, caring! Could this be a dream? 

 I worked late into the night and then got up early in the morning to finish my chores. I did finish them up before my Sis landed. Me and my cousin went to picked her up from the bus station. BIL was looking hip in shorts and tees. After we took them home, I was really anxious to get started talking to my Sis. Rest in the next post…

       I’m back on the blog after a week where my life turned on itself, for the better! So many thoughts in my mind I wish to put down. These are very important days which I’m talking about. Those you are unlikely to forget for the rest of your life. So where did I leave you? I’m meeting an olderman on a date for the first time in my life. 

 The scene shifts to Friday evening, when I finally fixed a time and place for meeting my man. He has his own car and we plan to meet at a common place and decide on further plans. I’m thrilled to the core. I even start feeling a little nervous. Come on, this is my first time meet on a date! So what do I do? I got to SilverDaddies.com and start asking around for tips on dating. And some tips I got. I met three gentlemen in there, all very kind and considerate persons willing to give me tips on how to be safe etc. One of them, a painter/artist, was a very interesting person. He actually reviewed the Promises demo after getting to know that I was writing songs. The kind of dissection that song received from him (called Jim) was remarkable. I felt wonderful hearing from an art critic, a person who knows his bearings when it comes to music. This guy plays about 5 instruments and has had a singing career. 

 The point I’m trying to make is the fact that it’s amazing the quality of persons this SilverDaddies.com has to offer. I have been using the internet for some five years now and I have to admit that this site now has generated for me, five or six persons who are awesome, not just from the sex point of view. Thanks to Mr. Dennis Andersen, the owner of the site. I pity my friends who are straight but interested in meeting interesting persons over the internet. They don’t have such a site I’m sure. 

 After this, my friend comes over from College and we both watch the movie “Indiana Jones: The Last Crusade”. What a movie! I really mean it. I loved the movie as much as I loved the Godfather series. The most moving part of the story for me was the bonding aspect between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery. Connery played his part charmingly well enough to enter my list of “Persons I would like to have sex with”. The screenplay was captivating and the amount of thought that went into writing it must be remarkable. I can go on blah blah blah for a long time. But the point is – what are the new age directors thinking when making movies these days? With all the technological advances, surely movies should be made better with such great screenplay. This friend of mine has suggested two movies which are actually out of the way from my kind of movies, which have been exceptional. The other one is “Hero” by Jet Li. 

 After that, I went to my friend’s place to check on his Dad who has had a surgery. This is a person who, I have had the worst days of my life. But now we have settled the issues somewhat. I would like to really ponder why I did this after he almost forced me to committing suicide one day. Might that be because of the fact that I secretly had a crush on him stretching a few years back? Or is it because of my friend, with whom I’ve had my most inspiring musical moments with this friend back in the days when we used to jam. Maybe, I expect some magic when we jam again in the future. Or is it because of the fact that he was my sister’s idea of an ideal person, the kind that I looked up to emulate when I ‘grew up’? Maybe it is because of my grudge with the persons who said I can’t possibly do anything in a relationship because I suck at it. Am I trying to show them that I can bring a relationship back from a point of absolute no hope to its full bloom? I think I’ll keep on pondering till death about this. 

 Okay, so back to this friend’s Dad. He, along with his wife, had almost destroyed the careers of both me and my friend 4 years back. Now, they are seeing new light apparently! They have finally realized that their son is not going to realize his full potential until he goes to a career featuring music production, a field for which he is most blessed with. It felt awfully strange to hear the words “My son can’t work in a field which is not interested in!” tumble out of their mouths with a kind of hesitation and with a feeling of dejection. Was I not saying the same thing when they accused me of destroying their son? 

 The point is: Finally I’ve won a victory in a battle that changed my life. Wow, I feel so much better! Story continued above in more posts…

       I'm not getting enough time to type in these days. Very busy always spending time outdoors, with friends or at the hospital. Maybe I need to drop this idea of the blog until I get enough time. 

 I am exchanging mails with this guy I'm about to meet. He's not a natural gay. Is married with wife and children. But he looks hot and seems to be a good guy and I think I'll meet him in a couple of days' time.

       Oh my, I can't believe this is happening. Finally, an older man from my very own city is interested in me! He has replied to my earlier message. We're planning to get to know more about each other before we meet. I'm ecstatic about this.

       Some about turn this is! Three monstrous changes in my life. Firstly, Creed has been disbanded. I don't know how to react to this. Thinking from one angle I feel that it's for the better cuz I know that Tremonti and Philips can kick ass without the limitations set by Stapp. But then, I'll be missing his voice! The new band (minus Stapp that is) is called and their record is coming up in August. I'm looking forward to that. 

 The other two would certainly bring about changes in my personal lifestyle. One is the news that there is a gay minister in the Indian Cabinet! Come on, this has to be a dream come true! This might come into more relevance when I'm actually contemplating losing my virginity to a daddy I met on "SilverDaddies.com" who resides in my home town! I never thought I would find someone from my town. This guy is called "oldlion" and has not yet replied to my message. But it's been only hours since I found and sent him a hello. I hope this turns out to be a great experience. 

 These three events have forced me to work on another song.

       Nothing interesting happening in life these days. Last two days have not been interesting enough to generate enough thoughts to write a blog entry. Apart from constructive criticism about my new song, nothing interesting has happened. I'm reading Lord of the Rings, apart from sleeping all day.

       Finally, after a long wait of over 700 days, I was at the my college hospital doing some work. Oh, I can't tell you how good it felt! I was a little edgy when I went there. I didn't know if I could fit in to the system to which I was so snugly engaged 2 years back. The first day, or night rather, went very well. I feel like a changed person now while interacting with persons, especially patients. But since I was not officially on duty, I had to keep a check on myself through out the whole time. I have this problem of putting myself under all kinds of rules and restrictions during some occasions where I was uninvited/shouldn't have been present. It's fine to have some kind of restriction always. But I overdo it most of the times. Thankfully, except for the wretched feeling it gives me, it has never back-fired! 

 It was a very different day/night yesterday. I went back to the 2 movies/day theme. Watched Gladiator on TV in the morning. Again, I fell in love with the magnificience of Rome and the empire. Lovely screenplay, great fight scenes and of course, gorgeous SilverDaddies! Wait a minute! Every movie I love has one or two of these cute older men. Is it because of them that I watch movies? I was able to generalize the question sometime later on in the day. After reading/sleeping till tevening, I switched on the tennis on the tube from the French Open. It was a total mishap of the Ladies singles championship match. I was still enjoying it very much? Why you may ask? What? Not again! Yes, there are a lot of moustached daddies in the spectators that, very curiously, attract the attention of the cameras. They keep on showing such guys between points dammit! Is this why I watch Tennis? Maybe it's not just me. Perhaps, everyone likes them! 

 After spending the day until about 4 AM at the hospital, I came home feeling fresh. I had decided not to sleep and watched "Braveheart" on DVD. I think the theme is naive but the cinematography deserves some applause. Having seen Gibson's "Passion...", I feel that he makes movies in a similar way. 

 One more thought that I would like to share with you today. I don't know how many of you interact with so many persons in your professional life. But, my profession is such that a lot of unsuspecting persons pass through my life, as patients, who, under different circumstances, would be ideal persons to have a crush on or start a relationship with. During my internship, I had a lot of feelings with patients. But I tried supressing them not only because I was still uncomfortable about my sexual identity, but also because of the fact that I believe in strict professionalism at work. In the last 2 years or so, I have come out and now am very confident about myself being gay. It's the first time after this that I have worked in a professional enviornment. I saw a couple of interesting men and I stared at them a couple of seconds longer than others. What should I do in such situations? Does anyone have any idea? 

 The lack of sleep, about a couple of dozen hot men (combined total from TV, movies and hospital) and the pleasure of finding my feet back in my work environment is making me very horny today.

       Yesterday's mystery has been partially solved. From what my friend suggests, the concept of man descending from the Dwarves is there in some mythologies. More specifically, the Nordic mythology (a.k.a. Norse mythology). For those who don't have a clue of what this is, it is the mythology originating from Germany. I have not yet found reference to this link. But that ain't the point. With the British Council library providing online access to the Encyclopaedia Brittannica and Oxford Reference to it's members, internet has become very useful to many like myself. Now I can look up anything that I don't understand at possibly the best knowledge bank available. Reading books, watching movies etc. has changed since this facility became available. For example, I learnt that the Harmonica comes in two types - Diatonic and Chromatic. The one which I started playing about a week is of the former type in C. This is so much fun! 

 I'm very excited about the fact that "Promises" is listener friendly. Most of my friends who have listened to it are happy about the song. This makes me wonder if I should devote most of the free time that I'm having currently to songwriting instead of having fun watching movies, hanging out etc. But then, artists should not be deprived of their sources of inspiration! Could somebody passover my 'issues list'? The insatiable craving for amusement today meant that I don't have any time to start on a new song. 

 Today's movie was "Harry Potter - The Prisoner of Azkaban" at the city's best theatre. It was my first experience with Rowling's work both in print or screen. I thought the story was a bit of a drag and the acting not up to standard. Screenplay could have been a lot better. But the best part of the movie was it's Animated parts. I really think that movies like "Hellboy", "Day After Tomorrow" and this Harry Potter movie have raised the standards of animation in Hollywood from the critically backed "highs" in "Spiderman". Honestly, I don't think the animationg in Spidrman was all that good. I'm referring to the jumps and landings in the film which look highly artificial. In this Harry Potter movie, the animation featuring "the Buck Peak" was simply breathtaking. 

 Coming off the topic of movies and back to my personal life which is taking a gently swing, I spent some quality time talking about topics from Profession to marriage with a couple of friends from college. This is something which I wouldn't even have imagined a couple of years back. Now I want to spend more time like this. Although I still suspect it has got something to do with the delectable variety of the Older Men on display at the locations where we choose to hang out, this is remarkable if you have been a friend of mine in the last five  years. 

 Another thing which I must note down is that I'm feeling very good about my right wrist these days. I played a whole badminton game with a friend of mine today without even feeling the slightest discomfort. If you are wondering why I should be mentioning this, I had sustained a sprain about a month and half back and couldn't even lift a glass of water using my right hand about 3 weeks back.

       I was never a good reader during my school days, thanks to the 'quality' of teaching at the schools. Add to it the fact that my parents never seemed to have time to spend on these apparently 'trivial' leisures, you get a prefect mixture for 'hypolexia'. I noticed something while I was reading a passage about Gay Issues on the computer with a friend of mine - he would finish a paragraph in about 2/3rd time that I would take. If that made me feeling funny, a comment about having to read the entire Lord of the Rings book set, multiple times, during your childhood got me doubting my scholarly achievements. 

 Although both of these didn't directly pushed me into starting the jumbo paperback of the 'pseudo-trilogy', I feel better right now after going through the first thirty or so pages. It has got me really interested mainly because of the fact (that I think) that the plot is based on mythology which attribute the Human race's origin from other forms of intelligent life (Dwarves). That's very interesting indeed. I don't know how many of you are bored after reading this post about some thing which you might have thought about a decade back, but give me a break guys! 

 As I mentioned yesterday that I'm recording this new song called "Promises". I did some remastering today and the demo sounds balanced. I got wonderful reviews from friends from all over and I'm very glad about it. If you want to listen to the song  urlLink click here  to download. Listen to the song (lyrics are in an earlier post) and send in comments. 

 About the two issues that I've been working with lately, one has been resolved to some sort of solution now. The other one is still there. I hope it's not too late before anything bad happens. Late in the day, some persistent rain spoiled my plans to be at the Casualty (ER) at College after a gap of 3 years with my friends. I felt bad about the missed opportunity which had given me the time to start the book. 

 Comments please.

       This following is a passage that I typed in the Gay Bombay e-group. Thought it might be interesting to read. 

  I thought I would contribute to this ongoing discussion about the
self-realisation of homosexuality. First of all, I must point out that I like
older men. The reason why I have such a preference might become clearer if you
know about my experiences as a child. 

 I was brought up in a family where my father didn't spend any time with me. He
never used to talk to me about what I was interested in etc. Besides he was away
from home for prolonged periods for work. This was the reason why I always
envied friends whose Dads were 'closer' to them. 

 When I was 8 years old, I used to go to play at my neighbor's place where my
friend's Dad used to chat with him about a lot of things. I felt attracted to
his Dad from a very early time as well. He must have caught me staring at him at
times because after some time, he gave me a lot of signs in a sexual way. Those
included undressing and masturbating (once). Even though these things did arouse
me, I was no way aware that I was being homosexual/gay. Honestly, I didn't even
know what sex was then! 

 After that, I began watching out for older men. And things started falling into
place. I was at another neighbor's house when an uncle over there was watching
tennis on the "then Cable TV". An uncle who invited me over didn't change the
channel when there were seens of nudity and sex. That was when I was about 10
years old. 

 In my puberty days, I felt the physical changes and started understanding sex.
When I started trying to read about sex, I never felt interested in women. I
would always read about men. Then I understood that there was something
different with me than with the rest of my friends. The hots for older men kept
raging on after I found a lot of books relating to sex in my uncle's library. 

 Then right through college, and my graduation I kept myself busy fantasizing
about men and eyeing hot older men. Now I'm 24 and it's been three years since I
have 'come out of the closet'. Most of my close friends now know that I'm gay
and I like older men. Some of them even try to understand me. I have not told
about my likings to my parents although my sister konws about it and is
supporting me silently.

       It always feels nice to salvage a day which begins like a disaster. After missing jogging in the morning and going out with a friend, I thought I'd be down and out all day. Despite realizing that I was cheated by my DVD rental store by being handed over half of the full "Ben Hur", I enjoyed what I could see in the movie. I must admit that half the time I was admiring Robert Brown, the sailor chief, who adopts Ben Hur as his son. Acting was great and the script interesting. 

 Then, I started on a new song called "Promises". I'll give the lyrics at the bottom of this passage. In this song, I'm trying to venture out to increase the my musical spectrum by putting in some Harmonica (for the first time!). I'm already into the melody but am not getting great ideas for the verse as of now. 

 I'm fighting a couple of issues with my personal life at present. I must confess that I have found a great friend. Right know, he knows more about me more than anyone else at present. I have to make a couple of very important decisions in the next two days and I hope they will be wise. 

 "Promises"

Why does one promise so often
Only to keep some, the rest left broken
A word which is used without the knowledge
Of it's actual power, Oh what we pledge

If making someone happy is your aim
It makes sense to decide, before you proclaim
What to say and when to do without letting
Anyone get hurt by you forgetting

Your promises
The near misses
Your promises
The death kisses

Never let them call you and remind you
Of what you said and what was due
Your discretion would save you
From all the shadows standing in queue

I can understand why you make those
Mistakes from which, oh it was so close
Go on and get a grip of what you say
Or you might find yourself in the grey of

Your Promises
The near misses
Your Promises
The death kisses

       Ha ha ha! I am laughing already at the title of my post for today. No prizes for guessing the movie which I watched today. I must say that I enjoyed the movie especially the funny parts. Needless to say, the hunky Dads on the movie really whetted my appetite. Apart from sex, the movie provided me with a lot of thinking about my life with my family. I am feeling very much like "Tula" from the movie. I dislike most of the things about my family and it's roots. I have a real problem with adjusting with my parents, cousing etc. I am spending most of my days wishing I was in a different family who enjoyed life in the ways that I like. In fact this feeling has been strong enough to influence my sexuality. The reason why I seek older men is because I would like my partner to be a guide/advisor/dad to me. Much like the regular "Dad" in my ideal family. 

 The movie ends with the thought that wherever one may go in life, your family is going to be there and you have to get on with that fact. Right now, I'm trying to escape forever from the clutches of this family. I'm trying to finish my studies in a city far from where I have been brought up in and then going on to settle there. I don't think I'm willing to let myself adjust to the family which I have disliked for a lifetime. 

 Besides this, I'm starting on the "Lord of The Rings" books which seem to be very interesting. I hope they entertain me much the same ways as Asmiov did with "Foundation" series. Another problem has come up these days. One of my friends is acting funny and is not willing to talk to me about it. I'm really wondering what to do next.

       Things didn't go as well as I hoped the other day at the zoo where Mr. Lion took me for a tour. But don't ever misunderstand me; it was still awesome. Even though I was not able to touch a tiger cub-they were just 13 days old and no one other than Mamma tiger has touched them-I got to see them very close. I got close to other big cats as well. The keeper of the felines gave us company this time and since he was nearby, the jaguars, lions and tigers were feeling more comfortable. One tiger, the oldest one in the zoo, came forward in the cage and settled near  us after the keeper called her by name. The couple of jaguars from South America (I guess) were much friendlier. In fact, they came to near us and rubbed themselves on the railings of the cage and even extended a paw of affection. I heard one of them purr and eventually we were able to see them trying to mate. I am ecstatic about the fact that I'm getting to see all this so up close and personal. 

 Apart from this, we visited some other animals with the zoo vet. It was amazing to hear the vet and Mr. Lion discuss the treatment options. It was much similar to what we do in our rounds at the hospital. The main difference was that animals were much harder to administer medications. Another difference in this trip was the fact that I didn't have Ray along with me. I sort of felt odd asking Ray if he would like to come along as well. Not because I wanted privacy with Mr. Lion. But because I thought about what Ray might feel about depriving me of privacy with Mr. Lion. Anyway, I thought it was up to him to make a decision and he decided against coming. 

 After this, Mr. Lion drove to a nearby parking lot. All you perverts, do not exert your imaginative skills too much. It was mid-afternoon and we were by a main road. Besides, we two aren't the all-sex no-talk kinda pair. At least, I am. I hope Mr. Lion is too but I've my suspicions about it. Mr. Lion, I must say I'm proud and surprised to find him like this, did not waste time and started on the topic of my sister and her problems straight away. He did it with such a level of sincerity and genuineness that I felt that I needed to take him in right then. But as I said earlier, we are no sex maniacs. During the discussion, there was an uncomfortable moment for Mr. Lion when I asked him his views about pedophilia. He apparently believed that sex between any two consenting  persons  was okay. I asked him whether he thought that a decision taken by a 14 year old (not just a random number) would be considered well thought out. And if no, how such a person could be considered fit to giving a learned consent. I was stressing on the fact that it should have been consenting  adults  instead of just  persons . Anyway, he didn't have an answer to this. This had somewhat lessened my urges to get it on with him then. But again, we are not sex-crazed adults to do it there. 

 My e-personal-life is getting hotter. Mr. Anonymous JK has informed me of his immense interest in me. I think we have a good chance of getting along well sometime in the future. Besides, Saul and I are exchanging mails (he is attaching his pictures along with mails) regularly. Is it a coincidence that I fall in love with him (he is attaching his pictures along with mails) regularly as well. My friend R. was very depressed the other day about the fact that we can never  meet in real life. He was so feeling down then that he thought that he should quit keeping in touch with me altogether so that he could get his mind off me. I thought that was too drastic and have been able to convince him from taking such a decision. 

 My Mom has started to come with me for a morning jog/walk. Of course, I and Chuck jog/walk by ourselves and Mom would walk alone without company. She is sort of pumped up about this and I'm happy about that. It is a shame that Dad doesn't even make an effort to join her. The talks with Chuck in the morning are getting more interesting. The other day, we talked about sexual fantasies. I was surprised to hear that Chuck (an ardent admirer and supporter of the porn industry) had very little few. The main thing he had was about having forced-sex; forced on his partner of course. Maybe it was the fact that he can't open up to me about such stuff. The curious thing to note was that I basically have the same thing in my fantasies. The only difference is that  I  (feeling elated) was the recipient of forced sex. 

 Oh by the way, I'm getting braces tomorrow. I've been frequenting the dentist this week to get myself prepared. I have had to get two teeth extracted in the last couple of days. It was not at all painful but each one took a lot of time to be extracted. Apparently, my love for felines has translated into the reality that even the roots of my teeth are shaped like claws. This also meant that Ray, who accompanied me to the dentist, had to go through a lot of boring magazines in the waiting room. He was so bored with a magazine called Filmfare that he has vowed to not touch it again. 

 Just after I had my tooth extracted, I've had physical reasons to be intimidating. There was blood dripping from my mouth. My lips were swollen. But most importantly, I was acting like I couldn't care less, thanks mainly to the wonderful advancements in the field of anaesthesia. I must have looked like a thug, a very thin one though. Why I bring up this point is that I have had a few points raised as to why I might be neglected/ignore in real life. One of them was the fact that I might appear intimidating (not physically but as a person who had achieved a lot even at this young age) to others enough to make them feel scared and neglect/ignore me. Well, you guys are going through my life and thoughts regularly. Do you think I can be intimidating?

       I never realized that two days of my life could give me so much to write about. I don't have a clue as to where to start. Maybe I shouldn't really be writing so many things about my personal life in here. Wait; that was not me talking. That was my mexican friend Saul's thought after he saw my blog. Saul was sort of uncomfortable reading through my blog citing that personal diaries are meant to mean what they are called - personal. But this personal diary, I said in an explanation to justify myself, is different. It is a medium where I get to write what I want, the way I want and I get a lot of satisfaction in doing so and getting comments of a few like-minded readers about it. I can go berserk in here. I explode into my fantasy world where gayness is accepted like down-town New York. Yeah, I'm referring to you Faustus. I'm jealous of the way you live. But it is okay, and under control. But I would someday want to live a life like how you do. 

 The day before, I was invited by Chuck to a party sponsored by a pharmaceutical company. The party was actually meant for the fresh-residents in the Orthopedics department. I was invited to fill in the numbers. The pharmaceutical company held a belief that such parties are useful for developing amazing levels friendship, solidarity and the spirit of team-work among the residents. Chuck, being the representative of the residents, found that inviting me was the only way he could continue deluding the pharmaceutical company representatives for more parties in the future.  
 Anyway, after the initial formalities-for those unaware, this includes introduction of new medications under the labels and a lot of bullshit about how the doctors are doing a world of good to everyone bye prescribing the company's own formulations and vice versa-got over, the feast began. Although the quality of food was appalling, alcohol was there to salvage some respect. I, being a honest preacher of non-alcoholism, didn't even want to take a sip. But Chuck and A. (another friend of mine) convinced me on the grounds of inevitability-Orthopedicians are the drunkards among doctors, the college to which I was going to do my residency set high standards in everything, including drinking-that I can't go without a drink at least. Eventually, I had a 'large' of brandy. What happened next is worth another paragraph. 

 This was the first time I was drinking. Maybe it was the empty stomach, maybe it was the fact that the proportion of adipose tissue in me was lesser, or maybe that my hepatic microsomal system of enzymes was naïve as compared to the others'-the drink had an almost immediate effect. I was starting to feel dysbasic, ptotic, ataxic and dyskinetic. I thought I was dysarthric as well, but was relieved to find that I wasn't after I got out of being 'under the influence'. But, I could think very clearly. And I was feeling stupid. I was not being under control of myself; the one thing that I always feel I need to. I was worried about this. I was feeling plain bad about this.  
 To not indulge in anything remotely close to being inappropriate, I started to fiddle with my mobile phone after going to a corner where there was no one. I tried calling Ray. But he was busy. I tried calling my sister. She wouldn't take up the phone. I resigned to typing in messages to Ray, once having to type the same message thrice because I had accidentally deleted the composed message by virtues of being dyskinetic. The effect wore off in little under an hour, and I was so happy to back in control again. I felt sick even momentarily losing the only power I seemed to hold forever. And I was thinking that I would never drink again. I didn't find any benefits to being drunk, of course it is from my point of view... at least until I got up the day after when, astonishingly, my prodrome of viral illness was gone! Wow, that justified me having a drink. I hope I won't have to search for more justifications in the future for both refusing a drink or getting drunk. 

 Back to my physical charms-wait a minute, I don't think I had too many the last time blogged. But things change, sometimes drastically. I happened to send a upper body nude photograph of myself (chest hair et al) to this very good friend of mine R. He was so excited about this that he replied in an e-mail with so many wonderfully strung sentences having words such as cute, sexy, wonderful, beautiful, lovely, handsome, adorable, that I finally felt that I'm at least okay looking in part nude. So, someone thinks that I'm hot. This sort of is like a revenge of sorts to May who says that I suck in looks. Coming from an older man, she still won't take it as a reason to believe the fact that I'm even remotely good-looking. But anyway, I'm happy about it. This comment, finally, gave Ray some sort ground trying to convince me that I don't need to feel so bad about my body, the way it is. He is okay with the way it is. Even Mr. Lion thinks that I'm cute the way I'm. But, for me, looks are very subjective. The subjectivity of the person himself, or herself for that matter, is the most important aspect in modulating decisions to amend looks. Therefore, I'm justified again. 

 Mr. Lion is back by the way; back from the hospital, and is very happy about the fact that he has a grandchild. The lack of opportunity for hands-on action had made him very horny when we had a couple of chat sessions. I thought that he was too flirty for an old man, but I loved each and every moment of it. I like ment who flirt. Especially dirty old men. Only when they flirt with me, that is. In our chat, we discussed a lot of stuff. I even asked him about his apparently pedophilic tendencies. He accepted the fact that he liked it but he never forces issues. I admire his honesty about this, but I'm not sure about the justification.  
 More importantly, of course for me and not the millions of poor little kids in the world who I admit I don't care too much about, the discussion drifted off to our next meeting, which happens to be today afternoon. Now, I want you to understand that the following couple of lines were actually meant to be in capitals, bold, 600% more in size and in alternating colors of pink and fluorescent green-Mr. Lion and I are meeting in the zoo today and he said he will try to get me near tiger cubs! Maybe even touch and play with one of them! Oh my me!!! This is the most exciting thing that someone has ever said to me. I really hope things work out well because if you don't already know by now, tigers are my epitomes of perfection. Tiger cubs add a share of cuteness, playfulness and amazing degree of stupidity-just like a kitten. So they are more attractive than a thousand penises, to me at least. 

 Yesterday was a wonderful day in my personal life. I spent almost the whole day with my beloved friends; Chuck and Ray. First we went to watch Spiderman 2. Nice movie, I have to say. I, increasingly realizing that I'm becoming an unstoppable critic in just about everything, found the animation sub-standard and the technicalities of the story line a little under-worked. The first half of the movie was better than the second half, where Peter Parker was given more prominence than Spiderman. After this, we watched the India Vs. Pakistan cricket match on TV. It was during this match that I found out about the surge of my criticizing instincts.  
 All through, I and Ray had the opportunity of being in the proximity of the amazingly cute older man-Chuck's Dad. I had imposed restrictions on myself on staring, flirting, having conversations beforehand. As it was about a month since I made the enforcement, I was feeling more at ease and actually was proud of how I carried myself there. Maybe I just overdid it by not commenting about  da man 's Chicken curry which was really tasting good. Today morning, when I finally realized this, I told Chuck and he smiled back at me as if to sympathize with effort that I was putting in. 
 I have a lot more to write about. But I'd have to postpone it to my next post because I need to run to the college hospital to sort out my admission procedure.

       In yesterday's post I think I sounded irrational. Perhaps I was. But I don't think I am generally irrational while taking my decisions. Career still reigns supreme over all other priorities in my life. But I would love having a love-life of your dreams along with a nice and stable professional life. I'm getting a lot of response from a lot of nice persons in the mailing list that I subscribe to. I'm already having enough to think about for some time. 

 Another interesting thing happened yesterday. After I and Ray went to May's place to help her out, we had been suspecting that she might pick Ray's gay identity up. Well she did that yesterday. And once she asked the question "I hope Ray isn't that gay friend of yours, is he?", I couldn't resist and as a result Ray has came out of the closet twice now. She has agreed to keep it as a secret and Ray is okay with this. 

 I have been having this viral prodrome for four days now; sore throat, stuffy nose and slight fever. I'm not ruling out anything now; and that anything includes the worst possible scenario, but I'm sort of wondering whether it is actually as bad as it can be. It is even worse now that I need to figure out alibis to take those X-rays of my impacted canine from a dental clinic (where I used to go to) to another one run by my friend (where I plan to go to from now on). Wish me luck with this!

       Ever since I have been to my friend's wedding a couple of weeks back, I have been seriously thinking about marriage. The very thought that my so-very-radical friend could adjust and adapt to the situations that demanded him to do so, is looming large in my mind. In college, it was us two who were the odd ones out. We never believed in arranged marriage. Hell, I was a strong opponent of marriages of all kind during the days when I was still not at terms with my sexuality. 

 Now, I approach the concept of marriage with more confidence. Of course, what I mean by the term marriage is 'gay-marriage'. It seems like a wonderful prospect. To fall in love and marry, then share everything, have fun and of course, sex with a man of my dreams; seems so rosy. That is my dream. And it will remain a dream if I stay in India. 

 Gay marriage is still a long way from being accepted in India where being openly gay itself is very hard. That is why I'm considering migrating abroad. My newly-wed friend and I had a conversation about this before his marriage. He had the opinion that the US of A was not the best option for me, as I had presumed. He thought that Europe is the best place to go and lead an openly gay life and maybe even marry. Canada was another good choice in his opinion. 

  urlLink   Now, it must a great coincidence that I have a lot of e-acquaintances from Canada. I hope I could fall in love with one of them and marry them! ;) One of them is the handsome Raul, who I had mentioned in a post some time back. I also promised that I would share with you a snap of his. I'm keeping my promise. Tell me what you think about him. 

 Coming back to the topic of migration; one thing that hurts me is the fact that I could have thought about this before I took my all-important decision-about how to do my post-graduation. I could have so easily opted for doing that in US/Canada and could have been studying there right now. But at that time, I wasn't even sure about my sexuality. Forget marriage. And that is why I opted to do my PG in India.  
 This leaves me with just one good option. To finish my MS course in India and after that try for options abroad. I'll be 28 by then. If everything works out well, I could be starting to do my two year rotation in US/Canada by the time I'm 30. But then, if that is the only way, there isn't any choice for me. Getting a visa is tough in India. I might have to get married to a person living in the country that I wish to migrate, to even get a VISA. By the time I'm 30, I hope to be in a position to tell my family that I'm gay I would only marry a man. 

 Wow, things look really complicated as of now. I think I'll have to read up a lot about the procedures and make my mind up in about 5 years from now. But will I be able to find my love by then?

       I have been rambling about my physical appearance in the past few days. I am being very self-conscious about the fat content in my body and its distribution, about what kind of postures that I adopt during daily routines etc. As a matter of fact, I just repositioned myself in my un-ergonomically designed chair as soon as I typed in the word 'posture' in the last line. I'll probably do the same every time I read this post. 

 In the last 2 years, during my preps for the entrance exams, I gained a few pounds of abdominal fat. It is very obvious; at least to me. I have a couple of ugly love handles and I have started energetically on the sculpturing of a 'tummy', which for some unfortunate reasons, is a genetic trait having high chance of inheritance in my family. Of course, if I decide to employ almost all of the muscle fasiculi in the anterior abdominal wall, I can get away with these now. 

 Curiously enough, and to my dismay, my gene pool lacks those lovely alleles for a muscular physique. Up to about 2 years back, my mid-arm-circumference could easily pass as that of a kid of 10 years. I have put on some upper body muscle since then, but I'm still very thin. The disparity in the upper body mass and tummy-mass further ruins my image. 

 I do some exercises at home. I have a couple of dumb-bells and do some crunches. And of course, I jog as regularly as I can. But still this abdominal pad only seems to increase. Today morning, when I was waiting for Chuck to turn up for jogging, I accidentally ran my hands along my side and had the ugly sensation of palpating your own 'love handles', tense with lardaceous fat! 

 I badly want to go to a gym and get in shape. I want to reduce my waist line so that I can slip in my size 30 pants with ease. Right now, only some of these fit me properly. But the problem with a gym is the timing problem and the cost. The cost is actually not prohibitive. But, I'm not earning anything these days. So I have a mental block. Finding enough time should be hard when I start working (voluntarily, meaning without pay) at the hospital at the start of next month. 

 I don't know if I have a body image problem. Maybe I'm being just plain health conscious. Or maybe it is because I want to evergreen-attractive in the gay sense. When I say such stuff to my straight-friends, they seem to laugh me off. Of course, most of them are more out of shape that I am. That doesn't mean that I can compare with them and feel happy about myself.  

 Whatever it is, I need to find a solution soon. Maybe I should stop eating like a pig, which I often do. Or maybe I and Ray should pitch in and get a few more weights and make a personal gym. Ray seems to be the only other person in my life who want to keep him trim and in shape. It is funny to note that Ray is also the only gay/bi person of my age that I know in real life.

       We live in the electronic age. It is true and the realization came a couple of days back. 

 The day before, when I was hanging out with Ray at my home, I received an instant message from May's mom on my MSN messenger. She informed me that May was not feeling well. She had come home early from the hospital and was feeling giddy. She had almost fallen down on arriving at home and needed to helped to a couch. She had a low back-ache and it was hurting badly. She could not even move. 

 I was very worried and I told May's Mom that I would come over and take a look. I showered, got dressed and took Ray along with me to May's home. She was lying on a couch. I was very glad that she was smiling on seeing me; glad because I knew it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. You can't imagine what ran through my mind when I thought of all the differential diagnoses of a low back-ache and giddiness in a young woman. 

 Thankfully, after I took her history and examined her, that too with my rusty clinical skills, it seemed like a simple back sprain. Besides, she was running a slight fever. If it wasn't a sprain, it should be a Viral Myalgic Syndrome. I consulted with the budding Orthopedician in Chuck as well. It was funny because this is the first time I'm seeking help from him in Orthopedics, the same field I was going to specialize in. I and Ray explained it to May's Mom who was very relieved after knowing that it wasn't serious. We bought her pain killers and asked her to take rest. 

 We chatted over tea and a delicious snack that May's mom had made for us. And then we departed. 

 I was glad that I could help my dear friends in need. I was even happier because my dear friends help me help other friends. The world seems so nice right now; like a fairy tale, with an electronic touch to it. How else can you explain why I should know about an emergency over an instant messenger, which was intended mainly for precocious pre-teens to have brainless chat sessions. The same instant messenger, by the way, is the medium blamed widely for promoting pedophilia over the internet in countries like the U. K. How ironic!

       I seem to have a flurry of topics to write on. Expect a lot of posts in a short time. 

 A couple of days back, I was just messing around with a couple of web designing tutorials from the internet on a dull afternoon. Heavy Alternative Rock music was blaring out from my radio and to add to the bewildering array of noise, yours truly was singing along. Ray was around; he was reading a text book in the middle of this commotion. I asked him why he would be studying when he had a perfectly calm room at the hostel. He said 'Umm… I have to be distracted by something so that I could concentrate on my books.' And I thought I was an expert at dishing out oxymorons. I bow to the king! 

 This is one of the seemingly endless list of similarities between myself and Ray. There have been so many discovered in the past few months that I am beginning to suspect evil wizardry and black magic at work. Anyway, I too enjoy reading my books when some sort of sound is there in the background. Most of the times, it is music on the radio. I don't mind if it rock, classical or jazz or for that matter, any kind of music. Just that it shouldn't be a talk-show. 

 Some of the ceiling fans available in India make enough noise to shut out all kind of sounds from outside the room. This is the only reason I love and hate ceiling fans. I love 'em when I need to be distracted from a noise source - read 'my mother, relatives or any unwelcome guest'. I hate 'em when I'm watching TV because they cut out the crispness of the audio stream. 

 Speaking of irritating sounds, the reason why I hate watching TV at home when Mom and Dad are around is because they seem to specialize in making noises that are amazingly irritating. Wondering why? Get a load of this -- Every night, my folks watch a hopelessly shallow Tamil soap called ' urlLink Annamalai '. Everything about the soap is shallow; the story, acting, script and even the sound track. Since they both are busy watching this, no unwelcome noises are heard and it is a perfect environment for watching TV. 

 Right after that, it is the time for sitcoms which I love watching. I go downstairs and switch on the TV. Mom and Dad get out of the couch and do these;

 
 Dad
 
	   Goes to his bedroom and turns on the radio moderately loud. A classical western concert is usually being played. The recording is poor and the radio is awful in sound reproduction.  
	   Takes up his ' urlLink mridangam ' (which by the way is a percussion instrument used in Eastern Classical music) and plays along with this. Of course, I should be enjoying this as I like all kinds of music. But what can I do if what he plays seems out-of-sync and too damn repetitive.  
 
 
 Mom
 
	   Goes to the kitchen and washes the dishes or does something noisy. Astonishing that she fails to realize that it is bloody irritating.  
 Talks on the phone to one of my aunts over the phone. Very loud. Conversation topics range from ordinary gossip, putting down other aunts, discussions about why the world should be coming to an end and why fate has been so cruel to them.  
 
 
 Both
 
	   If they both have nothing to do, they talk about things like how bad the other relatives are, why the word should be coming to an end, why fate has been so cruel to my mother, why my Dad's body should be itching at 11 O' Clock in the night etc. 
 
 
 

 You must be thinking why I can't ignore these things. I don't know why. I used to be able to during my childhood. But right now, I just seem to unable to, however hard I try. That is why I can't quite hope to watch a movie at home on the telly unless my folks are away or are sleeping. This is one big reason why I dig movie-halls. This also explains why  I paid to watch " urlLink Gangs of New York " in a cinema yesterday when it was being shown thrice weekly in one of the movie channels.

       I’m disappointed at the fact that I’m unable to progress with my plans to convert my website into a database based site on PHP/MySQL. I’ve been looking at some tutorials and all suggest that you can’t be a novice to do it. Therefore, I’m reconsidering my plans. I think I’m going to get a CGI/Perl template which is already available on the internet. That way I don’t need to think about buying server space as Tripod can host the site without problems. 

 Because of this web-designing dilema, that I’ve been postponing my plans to put on braces and to see my Urologist. Once this website-work is shoved aside, I think I will get more time to even think about this. I’ve been getting too much involved in something that should always remain as a hobby; a hobby which should be under control as well. 

 Mr. Lion now is a proud grandfather! He must be so happy! He became one on Sunday. He is very busy tending to his fatherly/grand-fatherly duties these days; so busy that he has partly forgotten his fatherly duties to me and Ray. I’m just kidding. We two are really happy for him. 

 I’ve been very fortunate to get e-acquainted with the most handsome person that I have ever met online. He is of Mexican descent and works as a flight attendant. We have been interacting over e-mail for the past few days and seem to get along well. I have to admit that he’s so near my kinda physical-perfection that I’m drooling over him in my e-mails. I’ll ask him if I can post his picture on my weblog so that you can appreciate his cuteness. 

 This guy has complimented me enough on my looks to redeem my self-esteem. I’m feeling happy now!

       I have a big problem. I think I am being neglected/ignored by far too many persons whom I know in real life. This has been happening to me from the time I can remember. And I do not enjoy it. Not even a bit. And it hurts. 

 Take the case of this friend’s wedding I attended recently. I happened to be one of only  TWO  friends of his attending the wedding at a city far away from our home. I was with the marriage party for close to two whole days. And I am relatively tall enough to be noted by any interested onlooker. 

 On the reception at my home town a couple of days after the actual wedding ceremony, I had the displeasure of being introduced by my Mom and Dad to the bridegroom’s family. They seemed to simply think that I was meeting them for the first time. Funny that I should know so much about four of them and none of them even remembered me. Okay, I might not be very attractive physically. But that should at least make them aware of my presence I guess. 

 This happens time and again, day in day out in my life. Today, when Ray, Chuck and I went to a restaurant to have lunch, a colleague of ours spent 10 long minutes catching up with my friends while not even bothering to look at my face. Maybe I  HAVE  a horrible face. 

 One reason why I’m so e-active is because I get more attention online than I can ever hope to get in real life. Take this blog as an example—At least 5 persons who I have not met in real life go through this blog everyday. Some of them even bother to comment about me and my life. The reason perhaps is that they don’t need to visualize me during this process. 

 Facts are facts and they must be accepted as they are. But they hurt, and hurt badly. I think I'm going to need some plastic surgery to improve my social skills.

       It is nice to be back after a tour to attend my friend’s wedding. It was a pleasant experience. Despite the fact that the wedding was a drawn-out, boring process, I had a nice time mainly because there were a couple of attractive older men in the bridegroom’s (my friend) party. One of them was his Dad and my friend knows about this. But he knows that I won’t do anything stupid. 

 One of the things that I was really worried about while planning this trip was if and how I’ll get along with a friend of mine who always seems to get to my nerves. We have had our share of squabbles in the past and are currently cool with each other. But I’m very uncomfortable around him and have been trying my best to avoid meeting him as much as I can. To my surprise, we found a couple of common topics on which we held the same general stand and spent almost the whole time on the train, to and fro, discussing them. That left me with very few instances of annoying remarks from him. 

 Along with that I got some quality time with my sister. I went to her home and spent a couple of hours with the in-laws. Like my friend, they were very nice as well. 

 Finally after coming back, I am feeling good about the trip. I am happy to have given Ray and Chuck some gifts that I bought and I’m actually giving my newly wed friend a gift at the reception party in my town today evening. I like this a lot. I’m thinking of the days when I never believed in giving gifts. I didn’t have any quality friends then. 

 The only let down in the scheme of things at present is the fact that my weirdo friend K is pissed after I refused him time at my PC. I really think that I had a genuine reason, and therefore, I’m not feeling too bad about this.

       Yesterday was a hopeless day for me thanks to a get-together with my classmates from school. I never liked my days in school. There was a remarkable consistency in the lowliness in every conceivable aspect my school life. Undereducated neurotic fools with mannerisms donned the role of teachers. I was known as the geek who topped exams regularly and because of this status, everyone acted funny with me. Being the youngest in my class, I was pushed around in the playground and was considered immature for naughty jokes and porn. It was a boys-only school which meant that everyone, except me, was fascinated by a particular page on the biology textbook dealing with the female reproductive system. To sum up, it was like hell with the difference that it was hopelessly less exciting. 

 I started from home thinking that I could pull it off the experiences of self-realization in my adult life. I was  SO  wrong. The initial exchange of pleasantries was the only enjoyable bit. From then on, things went from good to bad to worse to hopeless—read—discussion about what we’ve been upto TO delusion of grandeur because of being successful in life even after passing out of such a shabby school TO amazingly cheap jokes and deceitful heterosexist remarks TO the apparent lack of purpose in their lives apart from getting it on with a woman, of course. 

  urlLink   I was feeling rotten. I was lost. I was gay. In reality, I’m not rotten, nor am I lost and I  AM  very glad to be gay. But even the thought of coming out to these guys seems more of an impossibility than getting Bush to spell the word ‘possibility’. 

 Life doesn’t get any easier for me, at least in the next four days. I’m going on a trip to attend a friend’s wedding with a ‘friend’ of mine who pisses me off about 4 times in ten minutes every time we meet. Wish me luck, everyone. The only things that have cheered me up in the last two days – chatting with Mr. Lion who seems to get more attractive by the day and the discovery of a sketch of my perfect older man.

       Today, I did something criminal. No, I didn't get arrested by the police while doing 'unnatural sexual practices' as explained in the article 377 IPC. I did something on the internet. I copied a layout design of a popular website on the internet which I stumbled across while searching for tutorials. Of course I'm not going to give you details because I'm sure most of you will forget about this when I get my website running. And I'm sure I'm due for some praise. 

  urlLink   But seriously, I'm feeling guilty about doing something that I profess against. But it's okay I guess because I'm learning by fiddling around with someone else's design. Such messing around really teaches a lot. It is like a guided 'hands-on-tutorial'. I'm making some solid progress on this last two days. Once I get my layout right, getting it up on the internet should be easy as I have most of the content ready already. 

 Time for older men. After a period of two weeks, which felt more like two years, I went to the movies with Ray and watched 'Hidalgo'. The movie as such is just okay. But it does give a lot of 'food for thought' for guys like us. Omar Sharif is very attractive in the movie.  Especially with the kind of facial hair he sports in his role as a Sheikh. He would end up in my WHILTHS list soon I guess. It gets even better if he sports a stubble like this.

       Yesterday was very depressing; so depressing that I didn't feel posting despite the fact that I had so many topics to write about. For two days, I was stuck to my CSS layout making no progress. Everything I had tried ended in a total mess and I thought I needed to drop this idea about re-doing the website. Thankfully, today was a better day. I think I've gained some ground; something which I hope to confirm tomorrow. I'm feeling better. And that is why I'm posting. 

 The day before, I was lunch with Ray and my name-alike friend (who I'll refer to as Unni from hereon). Unni, by default, is very weird. He is hard to make sense of because of his fast articulation. He also tends to do many things that are unacceptable in social etiquette. We pretend to ignore his shortcomings and attribute them to his rather traumatic childhood. But this time he was even weirder. 

  Imagine having five separate conversations with friends going on at the same time. That is difficult enough. But what if it was with the same person? That would be unimaginably complicated. That is what happened. 

 Picture this. Us three sitting at a restaurant having ordered ' urlLink thali meals ' for each of us. It's a busy hour and we are waiting for the food to arrive. 

 Unni says, "Busy day at work. I'm tired and I'm very hungry." Looking at Ray he adds, "You ass, what about tomorrow's presentation?" 

 Ray says, "I have to go to the library to read a few journals in the afternoon. Care to give me some company?" 

 "Sorry," says Unni, "I still have a couple of patients to see. What is going on these days at the specialty postings anyway? Dude, I need to start reading. How is your Cardiology going?" 

 Ray says, "Things are not all well. I'm getting to learn things the hard way. Chief isn't happy with me at all. I totally messed up the findings of a patient. Got the timing of the heart sounds…" 

 Unni cuts in, "Tell me all about  urlLink Cardiology auscultation and percussion . Start from the basics. Dude, I need to learn. Shit, what's with the food?  It's been 20 minutes since we arrived. What are these SOBs thinking? You know, these Nephrologists and Cardiologists… they are messing the whole system. The side effects of the drugs which Cardiologists prescribe are the reason why the Nephrologist are getting their patients. You know what, you should never take up a specialization. Stick to to being a physician. A physician is the best way to go!" 
 At this point I entered the conversation and voiced my opinion about specialists. The argument seemed to go on  well until Unni suddenly interrupted me by asking Ray, "What happened at the party yesterday. You were totally stoned. Saying a lot of bullshit. What if she had heard what you said?" While he is saying this, he pokes in his ear with the ear pieces of his spectacles. Ray shudders. 

 When Ray tries to answer him, Unni carries on with his concepts about specialists. At one point, when the discussion was hovering around Cardiologists, I interrupted saying, "Hey, you promised you would give me my stethoscope back a month back. Am I getting it back?" A smile came over Unni's face and he said "Kris, you are so nice. Don't you believe me when I say that I'll give it back to you?" 

 I say, "Yeah right. You said sometime back that you'll give it back to me in 2 days. Why, why should I believe in what you say?" He says, "I'll give it back in 2 weeks. Sure. Please..." Suddenly, he turns to Raghu and adds, "You ass, you should have not gotten that drunk yesterday. You know I drank almost as much as you but was totally under control. Never lost it. What happened to the damned waiters? Bud, we should walk out of this crappy restaurant if the food doesn't get served in under five minutes from now." And he starts counting down looking at his watch. 

 This is how the conversation carried on for another 10 minutes until the food arrived. While we were eating, Unni couldn't contribute too much because he was preoccupied with the fast-disappearing contents of his plate. I was contemplating saving money to buy another  urlLink Littmann stethoscope . And when we left the restaurant, I was wondering if I would live to see the day when I could have a sane conversation with Unni.

       I guess I should have seen it coming when he started saying  urlLink weird things about me . The actual ditching process was arrogantly wicked. I had e-mailed him if I found me so annoying as to stop chatting with me and had suggested that if that was the case, we should stop interacting altogether. He edited the text that I had typed deleting everything but this -  'we should stop interacting altogether' . I'm sad to lose a very knowledgeable friend. But I don't think that I have done anything wrong. 

 It is funny that he should ditch me on the day when I found that my nick name Kris has a hurtful meaning; 

  Kris : Malay or Indonesian dagger with a wavy-edged blade.   
 In the last three days, I've found about half a dozen interesting blogs to read. I have actually started gathering a list of them which is on display on the sidebar on the right above my 'Previous Posts'.  urlLink Jalal 's  urlLink Search for Love in Karachi , so curiously named like Faustus MD's inspiration blog, is probably the one which I most enjoyed reading. The others whose style I'm still getting used to are  urlLink Sarah  with her  urlLink Tales of Ordinary Madness  and Sin with his  urlLink Venial Sin: Culture Chameleon . 

 As my irrepressable hunger to write about myself rages on, I'm amassing plenty--and when I say plenty, I mean it--of text for my personal website. Sometimes it is boring and I wish I could stop. But it cetainly helps if you get comments about this blog from someone as important as Mr. Lion himself. He actually typed in 

  "... is just fantastic. I do not want to boost your morale unreasonably, but i get a feeling that you are developing a fine talent. Your writing reminded me of Frank Kafka or Sharti Brata. Please keep it up. It gave a fine (though long) reading to me. All the same, I appreciate your style."   

 As I come to terms with issues in my life regarding  lengths , I'm glad I've found one where I need to decrease, rather than increase that of  something . ;-) 

 Wow! But I have to admit that I didn't even know who these two authors were until I looked them up on the internet. But I'm sad that I couldn't find more about their work. With suspicion of being deceived by flattery lurking in the background, I felt elated. And to add to this, I've been commented upon by a few of my readers. I feel very good about this. 

  urlLink   One strange feeling that is seeping over me is a desire to become a pig. Not any darned pig, of course. I would give up all of the rest of my life; rest meaning the part I haven't been talking about, for becoming a piglet like the one in the picture. For those still not getting the point, I love Cats - specifically Tigers and a certain breeds of Lions! The only disgusting part of the photo is it's source;  urlLink NewsIsCrappy.com . It's a pity that these people find such cute stories attractive.

       I'm learning HTML like crazy these past few days and as you might have noticed, I've been using the knowledge I’m gaining in the last few posts on this blog. Since it is turning out to be a pleasant experience, I'm currently working on a personal website describing myself and my life; something which, I hope, will be a welcome addition to my internet presence and something which the readers can refer back to and reflect upon. 

 That is the reason why, apart from checking my mail and checking a few other  NEW  blogs, about which I’ll write in an upcoming post, I have been sitting on at desk going on and on and on, typing about myself. I enjoyed it for the first 5 odd pages in my text processor when words were flowing like a jungle river. But things were different after an interruption of the most irritating type. 

 My namesake in real life, who is also a class mate of mine,  had  been my close friend until I found my new set of friends. We used to share everything at one time. After all, he was the first person I came out to. He has had his share of problems in life, some of which led me to firmly believe that the problems I have in mine are outright silly. Therefore, I have always tried to give room for him in my life because I felt like I have to help him out. Always. 

 Lately I've been suspecting that he has been making use of this freedom. He often rings me up late in the night, sometimes without any conceivable reason, rudely awakening my parents from their sleep. He comes to my place just to use my computer at odd times despite having a computer at home and having access to other computers in the hospital. His excuse would be that his own computer 'is not working'. He even goes through the personal messages on my mobile phone which has put me in several uncomfortable situations. I have tried to suggest to him that it is starting to get annoying and he always seems to shrug off my suggestions mostly by laughing or joking about them. 

 Yesterday, something happened of that sort. I was busy typing when he called. I tried putting him off but I'm very bad at that and ended up agreeing a one hour deal with him on my computer. I thought I will watch the Wimbledon final between Roger Federer and Andy Roddick. He came and I went down to watch TV. Well after the allotted one hour, I went up to ask him if he was close to winding up. He said "Sorry, but there is still more work" in a most fake kind of way that I felt like not looking at his face. To control myself, I had to take my guitar and play something to overcome my annoyance. 

 After a few minutes, I asked my friend. "Boy, if I were you, I would be running out of here as soon as I passed my time-limit." He said "Kris, you are just too good to be true." Although it didn’t, and doesn’t even now, make sense, I said "These days, I am very conscious about myself being a pain-in-the-ass to others. I think I'm beginning to be neurotic." He didn't reply. The sheer discomfort of the developing situation made me say that I will go out and get some dinner. I asked him that I would like him to finish his work before I returned. 

 Back after dinner, I was surprised to see that my friend had gone. I felt happy about how it ended; so happy that I thought I'll watch the Wimbledon match again. Not even ten minutes had passed before my friend came again. Now the excuse was that he couldn't open the file he had just made at his  home  computer! 

 Wait a minute! Was he lying about his computer? I felt horrible. Friends were lying to me and making use of me. But I played nice again. I actually watched some tennis with him trying consciously to avoid thinking about what had happened. I was so engrossed with concealing my feelings that I had to fumble through the stack of newspapers very clumsily, unlike the normal me,  to find out last Sunday's crossword so that I could cross-check it with the solution for it published this Sunday. 

 Thankfully, a call from my long lost friend who is getting married in under 2 weeks time saved me from further discomfort. I talked to him over the phone for over half an hour and by the time I had finished, my friend had finished saving his work again to his floppy diskette and gone. 

 I must comment about the quality of tennis at this point in my post. It was simply breathtaking. Ballistic serves and fore-hands from from Roddick and elegant, graceful, flowing, classic tennis from Federer. I was instantly wondering what I have been missing in the past few years when I couldn't find enough time to watch sport on TV. But then, there will be times like these where compromises need to be made. 

 Back to my day-By the time, my friend departed, it was already too late to start on my monologue about myself as the Euro 2004 final was starting soon. I watched the splendid match; many would disagree to this I'm sure. I could watch the match only till my cable company screwed the whole thing up late in the first half! How mad I was at that time! First, I thought of waiting. I even tried staring at the in an effort to coaxe it back to life! After about half and hour, I thought this was not going to work out and decided to hit the sack. Before I did that, I switched on BBC World Service on my radio. 

 The match was on! Whoa! Fans screaming and perceptibly-excited commentators screaming on top of their lungs describing advances made by either of the teams; It was riveting! It was simply very exhilarating just to listen to it. I was left wondering why the TV commentary should sound so insipid. 

  urlLink   I thought I would re-start typing on my monologue. But now, the words were not flowing. I was feeling bored typing what I was typing. It was not happening for me. But it was certainly happening for Greece. They went on to win 1 - 0! I bow to the splendid work ethic of the team and execution of the tactics deviced by the coach Otto Rehhagel! In fact so much so, that I'm getting attracted to him already. 

 The cable connection was restored just after the long whistle at the end of extra time of the second half. I went down to see the celebration of the Greeks and the presentation ceremony. It was wonderful. I felt a tinge of sadness when I saw the face of Figo, Rui Costa and Couto. They all were from the golden generation of Portugese football which promised so much for the passionate nation, but delivered nothing. 

  urlLink   I have to admit that the best moment of my day was in the pre-match show when an interview with Scolari was being shown. Oh, he's so cute! He is so expressive. I felt that I was just melting into the couch I was sitting on when he explained how he would react if Portugal go on and win the tournament by a gesture - he pointed out where the his lips are at that point with his two fingers and then dragged these fingers to points bilaterally symmetrical in front of his ears to show that he would be smiling that big! In the end he didn't end up smiling at all. That was disheartening too. 

 I never meant to let this post go to this length. But I am trying not to put any restrictions on what comes out of me. That is the way, I've been told, to write engaging stuff. I hope this is true and you find this interesting.

       In the last few days, I've been referring to a list of Persons with whom I would like to have sex. Since I'm learning HTML from its very basics, I thought why not make a list in HTML coding? This, folks, is the final result. I spent about a quarter of an hour trying to figure out a name for this list so that the initial letters would become an easy acronymn. And that is why this is called "With Him, I'd Like To Have Sex" (WHILTHS) list. Those who are waiting with bated breaths to see if you have made it must note that the names are not arranged in any order of preference. 

 For those who have missed out; this list will be updated regularly. Therefore you have every chance to make it sooner than later. As a generous gesture to help out the not-so-lucky-ones, who may also be referred to as ' losers ', I'm putting a list of my turn-ons at the end of this post. I advise you to keep trying! Not to forget my e-buddies - a separate section is in the offing. Come on and please me baby and find your name on the list! ;-)

       The 'Godfather' has finally parted ways with us. In a remarkable career full of controversies and brilliance, Marlon Brando gave us a lot to cherish with his astonishing portrayals of characters. And for this reason, for the third day in consecution, I'm using photos in my blog entries. The reason is the same. I adore this guy! And he, as you might have guessed by now, is on my  urlLink WHILTHS list . Like Saddam, he lost some of his voluptuousness as the years ticked by, mainly due to his weight problem. Here's why.     urlLink      urlLink       Marlon in Godfather  Marlon in his later years    It might a stark coincidence to note that the first picture should come from a site called  urlLink Moustache Database . Most of my best men would be on that database I'm sure. If there is any other database that might reveal my favorites, it might be called 'Frown-lines on the forehead Database'. Marlon, Robert De Niro, Jack Nicholson, and Sean Connery - they all have such sexy foreheads when they frown!  I've been reading up about  urlLink Marlon's career on New York Times  and there were a lot of things which I thought I should quote here and comment about. 
  In addition to physical beauty, Brando brought psychological torment, moral ambivalence, savage intensity and a smoldering, at times oddly ambiguous, sexuality.  Now, I don't think I should search further for reasons why I like him as much as I do. Maybe it's the gaydar thing!  "Whenever we want something from somebody or when we want to hide something or pretend, we're acting. Most people do it all day long."  I really believe in what Brando is saying here. In fact I think that is what I'm doing each and every living moment.  Jack Nicholson, who co-starred with Mr. Brando in "The Missouri Breaks," (1976) and was a friend and neighbor for many years, termed him "a genius who was the beginning and end of his own revolution."  Mr. Nicholson said that Mr. Brando was the reason that he - and many other actors of his generation - entered the profession. "I was in high school when I saw `The Wild One,' " Mr. Nicholson said."He changed my life forever."  All throughout reading the article, I wish I was someone who knew Marlon in real life. But at this point, I wish I was Marlon himself. He lived next door to Jack Nicholson and they have been great friends! Come on, what I have I done to receive this tormenting? And I could have changed Jack's life forever if he had allowed me to! ;)  Docker hasn't yet replied to me about what he thought about chatting after what had happened between us in the past few days. I am hoping that he would adjust with my 'limitations'. I haven't heard from Mr. Lion again since he replied after a gap. Maybe he is busy taking care of daughter before her delivery. I should allow him some room here, I guess.  Things are starting look brighter in my hobby field. Yesterday, I took a couple of books from the library about HTML and PHP. I'm going through the HTML books as I type because I'm using my HTML to design this little post here itself. Why such a sudden impetus? Well, because I got another offer from a person who owns a big shot in the Medical PG field on the internet to host my website on his servers. I really thought I should upgrade my website before I think about hosting options. The owner of the  urlLink SilverDaddies.com  site was also generous to help me out with my nagging doubts. I am grateful for that.  I've been writing some mails to my sister. But she apparently doesn't get time to read through these. I know things are not 'bright' with her in laws. But I think my BIL and Sis should try and read through what I write and reply the situation demands it. I don't know if I should excuse her for being lazy. But do I have another option?

       I know that the in-thing these days is Photoblogging. But it's not due to that reason that I'm posting so many photos in my posts, as I'm going to today for example. 

 I have been bragging about my  urlLink WHILTHS list . Yes, so from the time of the Kuwaiti invasion in early 90s (I know some of you would positively stop breathing when I finish this sentence), Saddam Hussein has been in there. If you are not seeing the light in my argument, this is why.

 If you still don't like him try these.

 At least this should get yourself attracted! 

 urlLink   

 I know that I'm crazy about him. But, don't you see the reason? Come on, wasn't he cute? Didn't he hold a powerful position? Doesn't he look downright - I mean business - kinda guy? But as many older men, he hasn't gotten any better with age. Check these pics out to find why. 

 urlLink   

 urlLink   

 Maybe it's because he didn't have nourishment during the months of refuge in that pit. Maybe he is having some other affliction (I heard that he might have cancer). But anyhow, he's not as hot anymore. 

 Mr. Lion's computer finally is back up and running. You know the funny thing in his mails is the way he conceals the words like sex, fellatio with words like 'discussion' and 'active participation' etc. This reads crazy when you actually are reading mails. I guess this is to keep himself under cover, from his family, about his gay identity. 

  Mr. Docker is acting serious and weird these days. The other day, he was offended(although he has not admitted yet that he was) when I asked him to read my blog. He said that he would like to know more about me before reading the blog as he thought that it was intrusion of privacy otherwise. That is strange enough for me. He went on to say that I keep on changing topics in chat and that when he wants to continue on a particular topic, I am tenacious. Today morning, he asked me a set of short, direct questions. I answered them. He asked me if I would like to ask some about him. As I was chatting with a few others at the same time, I took some time in replying. I apologized and explained this. He winded up the chat saying 'Next time I send you a greeting, if you are already engaged in chatting with someone else, please tell me.  I prefer to chat one-on-one, without competition. Good night.' Is this strange or what? Maybe it's the age factor - he is 75!  

 I don't know if you have heard of them,  Red Rain , a gospel (I presume) band from the New Zealand which performed in  my town  yesterday. I and Ray had almost decided on going. But the gospel thing put us off. Even  urlLink their website  is in an *.org domain! We spent the evening doing a crossword instead. I am wondering if I have squandered an opportunity to see a rock band in action. It's so rare a phenomenon in this part of the world!

       My mother retired voluntarily from serving the Central Government for over 40 years yesterday. She was an employee of Department of Posts. There was an official sending off function at the office and a lot of her colleagues gave her a farewell accompanying her home. She, as I can understand very well, was very touchy about this. This was probably one of the moments in her humble career-one in which she had to sacrifice promotions for staying with her family. She used to be considered as a trust-worthy, reliable, efficient person at her office; almost the exact opposite to what she was in her family's eyes. Apart from this, I know how a work environment can liberate oneself from the limitations imposed by the family structure. I knew my mother enjoyed working immensely. But as she was tiring, she had to compromise on that to enjoy a quiet retired life. 

 Anyway, the point that I'm trying to make is that I knew how important this was to her. And that is why I did my level best to get everything ready for the guests. I spent almost all day doing that hoping to make her feel really good about it all. And it worked! And I'm happy; maybe even proud! 

 Apart from her colleagues, almost everyone from my father's side of the family came for the function. Some even got her gifts! You should have seen the thrilled look on her face when she opened up the package with the Mysore Silk Saree, an expensive one, which my sister and in-laws had sent! Everything was so bright and happy! One any other day, this kind of get-together could have been one of my nightmares-I would get stuck in these pointless arguments with my relatives about topics such as religion and marriage. But it wasn't in the end! It was actually fun! I enjoyed being the "nu" Me; somone who  is  mature enough, and matured enough in the eyes of others, to not be tampered with in his concepts about various issues. Would you believe that I actually enjoyed recording the new mallu hit "Lajjavathiye" with me on the guitar and my cousins on vocals?! This remarkable step in my musical career can be looked at as a deterioration in the quality of music that I play. Or maybe just expanding one's own horizons. I take the second. 

 I never want to get too serious about anything in life, at least for a prolonged period of time. That is why I'm giving you this piece of info about the origin of the "Man with the Moustache". I adore men with moustaches; they are the sensitive stimuli for my Gaydar. But this one's actually a bit too straight for my pleasure. But it's fun!

       Go Portugal, go! Go Scolari, go! Yes, he was looking really hot yesterday when the Portugese played sublime football the go past Holland to the Euro 2004 Final. It was funny that the TV anchor (John Dykes on Star Sports) should point out similarity between the looks of Luiz Felipe Scolari and Gene Hackmann. Being the crazy nut I'm, you'd expect the proof, which is below! Woof!

 I guess this occasion calls for Scolari to be added as the latest entry in my " urlLink With Him, I'd Like To Have Sex " List (WILTHS List). Gene was already in there long time back. 

 A few weeks earlier, I was talking about the rumor of a gay minister being in the Indian Cabinet. Since then, the thread of the discussion in the Yahoo! Group  urlLink Gay_Bombay  where this info was posted has revealed two other personalities; a couple of Chief Ministers, including one who's presently holding post and a former prime minister. None of the members have gone on to point out who these persons are. The closest I could get to guessing was that the former gay Chief Minister is the late Mr. Rajesh Pilot (I hope I'm not mistaken) and the former Prime Minister - Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. 

 Today, July 1st, is Doctor's day! I wish all my fellow colleagues on the occasion. And to just to pep things up, I'm posting a medical-related joke. 
  A lady walked into a pharmacy and spoke to the pharmacist. She asked, "Do you have Viagra?" 
"Yes," he answered. She asked, "Does it work?"
"Yes," he answered. 
"Can you get it over the counter?" she asked.
"I can if I take two," he answered.

       Today, I got into our college library after about 3 years. It felt wonderful to be back inside the place where I used to spend a lot of hours in my undergrad days. But I had to go through a lot of shit to get in.  To get inside the library, you needed a college ID card. I was denied of one because I was doing Voluntary training. Without and ID you had to get an external membership after paying extra charges. That is not the actual catch. With external membership, you cannot use the library after 4 pm in the afternoon. Of course, I can't accept that. So I had to meet the Principal and a couple of professors in charge of the library. Hopefully, I can get the confusion sorted out by tomorrow. 

 Ray and Mr. Lion met again and had sex today. Ray was really ecstatic about this when I met him in the evening. I couldn't get Mr. Lion's reaction to this. I am sure he would have enjoyed this as much as Ray did. The coolest thing is that I am not even feeling bad about missing out. I guess, I can wait even longer for more action. 

 In the night, after a sudden surge of inspiration, I re-recorded 'Living Your Dream' again. This time, I did it with a capo on the 3rd fret. I was amazed to listen to the result. This really looks like a listenable song. I really wish I had written something better. Maybe I should re-write the song. I don't know if that is technically correct ie. compose a song and then re-write the lyrics. 

 Two days after, guys.

       I’m totally enjoying my re-entry to professional life. But, that means that I’m getting very little time to stuff like blogging. I guess that this would mean that my blogs will get more concise and therefore, more readable. Fine. 

 I have started on a new song called ‘Living your dream’. I thought the lyrics sucked. Try the poem at the bottom of this post. I have the basic melody and the chord progression and I recorded a demo a couple of days back. It sounds okay. I hope I’ll do much more with this song than previously. Usually, I end up making a melody and recording a demo, stop there and start working on another song. That means that very little time gets invested on improving the song. Sort of lazy, isn’t it? 

 I had a disappointing time watching ‘Van Helsing’. Screenplay was drab, acting was average, animation poor and the movie was very, very predictable. I hope ‘Troy’ gets released here soon. 

 I read a couple of books by ‘Ben Elton’ in the last month or so. I think I’m getting very interested in fiction of the comedy/satire genre. I’m going to try P. G. Wodehouse again. 

 

‘Living Your Dream’

  After what seemed like eternity 
I redeemed some dignity 
Head held high, beaming face 
I saved myself from more disgrace 

 If you want to know why 

 A few years back, I recall 
On a rainy night in fall 
I discovered a hidden beauty (which) 
Cleared out the dark and misty 

 I won't get paid for this 
But it's something I can't miss 
I want to run and scream 
Nothing like living your dream 

 It was a busy day 
I missed a movie today 
A routine With my best mate 
And more of this I can take 

 If you want to know Why 

 Because Now, I have realized 
A dream, from the day I cried 
And it gives me what I need 
Without which I would bleed 

 I won't get paid for this 
But it's something I can't miss 
I want to run and scream 
Nothing like living your dream

       Yesterday was my first 24 hour duty at the hospital. A good one actually. Not too busy. Got a nice sleep in the night as well. Got time in the morning to come home and clean up and be at the hospital in time for rounds. 

 Yesterday, when I was eating at a restaurant close to the hospital, I ran into the bystander of a patient. This patient is a 'hot' older man. The bystander was not as 'hot' but was very well behaved. I greeted him and asked him about some lab results. Nothing serious, just small talke kind of stuff. Today, while leaving the patient after checking him, the bystander said a 'Thank you sir.' I felt honored. I felt wanted. It was a great feeling. 

 I have got a Yamaha acoustic guitar, courtesy my friend. The strings are very old and need to be changed. Other than that it sounds great. I'm looking forward to changing the strings and playing it. Maybe I will try writing something tomorrow.

       I’m very glad to inform you that I’m very happy about starting to work after more than 2 years out. I’m feeling great about it because everything was great about today. The team with which I will work in the future were warm and friendly. I got over my initial anxiety and nervousness in under an hour and was very comfortable doing those routine things. Talking with patients, discussing clinical problems, listening to little lectures, sharing a joke with a fellow doc; it was all so much fun. Yes, I’m back as a doc. 

 Why am I feeling so happy? Maybe it is because I have removed the possibility of another perfect stranger asking me what I’m doing nowadays and I having to reply to it with ‘… uh … duh … basically, nothing!’. Maybe it is because I have started on living my dream of becoming a successful Orthopedician. Maybe it is because, every day, I can go from my home where I’m considered an outlaw, to a place where someone would smile at me and give me some respect. Maybe it is because of the fact that I can get to see a lot of cute older men in all ages, sizes and shapes in the hospital. Don’t worry. I saw a couple of ‘woofables’ today (as patients) but was under total control of myself. 

 I guess, I should put this good mood to use and re-start song-writing! 

 But, things can never be so perfect for anyone. Not even me. On the downside, I’m having 
 
 a toothache because of one of the extracted teeth 
 a lot of silly arguments and fights with my parents in the past two days 
 getting used to my altered diet after my braces have come on 
 

 The funny thing about the problems with my parents is that, even though I realize what is going wrong, I don’t feel like doing too much about it. I can’t explain it why, but it is so. 

 Oh, there was this one thing that brought me a wonderful smile in the morning. There was a photo of one of the tiger-cubs in the zoo being bottle fed by the zoo vet; the guy who I was discussing about things the other day when I went to visit the zoo with Mr. Lion. First of all I felt happy. Then I started feeling jealous. I hope I can coaxe Mr. Lion to try getting me closer to tiger-cubs soon.

       First of all, I never meant it to be this bland, a happy friendship day to all of you those who come and spend their precious time reading my blog and commenting on it. You have made my life richer by doing so and I'm very grateful for that. 

 Now, having that load off my chest, I can write on some grave issues. Grave issues from my personal POV (Point of View for those who don't follow such wicked acronym's). The last few days, I have not been finding enough time to blog! Whoa whoa, stop it right there? What am I saying? Yes, it is true. It is a fact. I'm not getting enough time to blog, to read and reply to e-mails etc. The reason for that is that I am starting work on Monday, August 2nd. 

 It has been over 2 years since I have been to a hospital. Lots of stuff I had to do to get everything just right as I start work. I had to get my wardrobe back up and running, especially the formals section. I had to get my lab coat, theatre-dress (scrubs) cleaned. Tomorrow, I have to iron a truck load of stuff while watching the Asia Cup final between India and Sri Lanka. My scooter needed service. The list of chores could go on and on... 

 Besides, I have been spending a lot of time at the dentist's. Oh! I haven't told you yet, have I? I have finally got braces on. It is not as uncomfortable as some of my friends suggested mainly due to the fact that traction using rubber bands has not been applied on mine yet. And because they are  urlLink ceramic braces , they look great. For that, I have had to subject myself to a couple of tooth extractions. Both were relatively pleasant extractions. But the second one has given me a long, thin, crevice in my mouth which lodges food residues which accumulate, putrefy and impart a nice little toothache/headache. 

 This has been quite a problem for me over the last couple of days. So much so, that I have had to use analgesics (painkillers) for the purpose. Well the pain is sort of dull, vague, depressing type and handicaps me in almost everything. Besides, I have have horrid time eating because it is hard to chew with braces on. And once you have eaten, you actually feel like a rhinoceros in a stenchy pool of dirt because just about everything you have eaten seems to have stagnated in your mouth. 

 That is not all. It is better for me to not have tea/coffee or any colored/stainable beverage because they can stain these ceramic braces. You have got to admit, what is the point in having these expensive ceramic braces if they get dicolored? 

 Having read all this, you might be worndering if I'm feeling bad about putting on braces. It must be obvious, right? But it isn't. I'm feeling okay. One of my friends pointed out a few years back: 'Kris, you have a wonderful face. But you need to get your teeth sorted out to let the beauty through!' I guess, all this trouble is worth taking if I'm going to get a wonderful smile in under 2 years time. After all, I'm going to be on the hunt to seduce the hottest men on the planet. And for that I need to be physically endowed.
