       Stop Calling Me   I feel sorry for men in a way because you really can't win.  I want you to be the hunter, yet when you take on the role you automatically become a psychopath.  If you call everyday, I think you are a pussy. Yet not calling at all makes you a player. So I ask myself, what is the proper amount of times to call during a week?  I say five times max. Wednesday should be the day you call to organize for the weekend.  Then Thursday to say "you miss me and can't wait to see me." Friday to set something up for Saturday. Saturday to make sure everything is cool and you'll see me where ever. And Sunday to tell me what a great time you had and to tell me to have a great week.  Then let it breath for a couple days.  Although, I know this phone rule only goes for me. I know there are these needy women out there that require you to call everyday, if not several times a day. Those are women who want you too cut off your balls.  Maybe you don't like your balls? In which case call everyday, call a hundred times a day. Call me when you're with me, just to let me know "you miss me" when you are outside smoking.  Okay well? that one is oddly cute, but you get the idea.  Less is more...

       Making it in NYC   I hate trying to “Make it” in NYC,  I’ve worked the most insane jobs in the world, just to “Make it.” I go back and forth between the restaurant industry and the Back of the Village Voice. For those who do not live in NYC, the back of the Village Voice is the adult help wanted section. Otherwise known as the last resort job section.  So this is how the past two and a half years have been… Waitress, phone-sex operator, Waitress, Phone Girl for an escort service (AKA PIMP), and now back to being a server.  But the worst part is, I feel like being a server is just a more respectable way of whoreing. Especially in NYC where it has more to do with how pretty you are, and less to do with how good you are at being a waitress.  I mean why do I need a headshot to wait on tables?  Why are my tips dependent on how well I flirt?  I wish I could find a normal job, where I didn’t have to depend on the kindness of strangers.  Heaven is stability. I just want a normal life.  I want a desk job….

       Funny chain letter   You've gotta read this.  It's hilarious!  Did you know that you can tell from the skin whether a person is sexually active or not?  1. Sex is a beauty treatment. Scientific tests find that when women make love they produce amounts of the hormone estrogen, which makes hair shine and skin smooth.  2. Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses the pores and makes your skin glow.  3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that romantic dinner.  4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up.  It stretches and tones up just about every muscle in the body. It's more enjoyable than swimming  20 laps, and you don't need special sneakers!   5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases endorphins into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and leaving you with a feeling of well-being.  6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called pheromones. These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy!  7. Sex is the safest tranquilizer in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM.  8. Kissing each day will keep the dentist away.  Kissing encourages saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid that causes decay,  preventing plaque build-up.  9. Sex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release the  tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain.  10. A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a natural antihistamine. It can help combat asthma and hay fever.

       I'm a pussy   Last night at work I cried, and I feel so retarded, I know there is no reason, but I do.  We were playing the psychology game and came to the question, what is your number one strength that will take you the furthest and what is your weakness that will keep you back.  I thought about it, and I thought well, I can lie or I can be open, which is the entire point of the game, to be open. So for my strength I said, "my kindness, my ability to be open and read people."  for my weakness I said, "that I'm uneducated"....I lost it.  As many of you know, I did not graduate high school, and I ended up getting my higher education at an Acting school.  I'm not saying that I'm stupid. I'm intelligent, but I'm just not educated.  Now I shouldn't let this bother me so much.  But most of the people I hang out with are at least five to ten years older than I am.  The thing is? I'm the only one that puts myself down about this.  I mean sometimes people will say condescending things to me that hurt my feeling, but I just ignore them, it's not that I can't say anything back to these people, but I was raised to be better than that.  I just wish I was more educated.

       Silverware   I am so insane, now anybody that knows me knows that I am far from Martha Stuart.  But there are certain things I do that I’m… um…how do you say? Anal fucking retentive about. Like when it comes to doing the dishes, I’m really bad, I start off with a pre soak, then the pre-wash, then the wash itself, and this evening I went even further and put all of the silverware in a pot, and boiled it.  I felt for some reason that this would make the silverware particularly clean, as it in fact did do.  As I put the silverware away, I thought to myself how happy the silverware was to have been so nurtured, how glad it was to be so clean, and how pleased I was to have it so clean.  I imagine they felt the same way I do after I have an hour-long shower,  and I’ve just done the laundry and I have a fresh towel waiting for me. I smell amazing and the towel smells so clean and welcoming. The very same way my silverware must feel. Clean and welcoming.  Like a girl knowing she is going to get laid that night, and how she cleans and pampers herself just to have the night end with her all sweaty and dirty. But in that really wonderful way.  My silverware is so ready to get used, they look all hot and...damn...they are just asking to get all dirty and soiled again.

       STOP...snuggle time   I hate to be a little bitch, but I really hate the cold, and this has been the worst winter yet here in NYC.   I wish I had somebody to snuggle with.  Not even in a sexual way, this can be a girl or a boy.  But somebody to tickle my back, Although, my lovely friend Lisa did give me a back tickle last night.  I’m like a kitty cat unless you are going to stroke me I have no use for you.  I miss my friends Colleen and Debra   My favorite moments with them were when we would put a movie on, and debra would be in the middle, and colleen and I would lay beside her and she would rub both of our heads at the same time.  This was not just for like five minutes either, this is for like the entire length of the movie.  I would even say, “if you’re tired you can stop?” and Debra would always contentedly say “I’m fine”  she would often put me to bed with her back tickles.  And then when nighttime came, All three of us would spend the night in My queen sized bed. All three of us comfortably sleeping sideways on the bed curled up into little balls, with Debra always in the middle and colleen to her right and me to her left. Or when My friend Heather and I would get into the Hot tub at like midnight... and then go make pasta and eat it on the trampoline in the back yard. I miss that.  I miss that a lot.  They were such a simple things to do. Odd but simple.  Isn’t it strange though that some of the simplest things to do, are things you can only do with people you really know and feel safe around.  Some days I feel like I’m missing something, I think what I missing is a group of people I feel truly safe around. I love New York, but the people are very inconsistent … something I have always hated in people. I don’t even want to try half the time here. Because what’s the point of putting  any investment into people. Maybe that’s just getting older and not even NYC itself?  But the older I get the more I realize that I really hate people.  I guess what I loved so much about my friends back home is that, we were all kind of misfits or loners, but we found each other, we found all we needed in each other, and I was never alone.  Even if I was? I fully knew that there were people that really valued me in their life.  It’s not to say that I don’t have that here.  I just felt complete with the company I kept there. I don’t feel complete, I feel pacified, I don’t know if that’s the right way to say it?  I guess I feel like I have enough here to get by, but not enough to feel absolutely complete.  I truly can’t wait for my birthday, because it means I am one year older. I feel that people get better with age. I can only hope the same is true for myself and that 24 will bring me closer to being a content and  happy person. Or at least bring me somebody to laugh and snuggle with.  Somebody I could build a living room tent with,  and we could hide inside and tell jokes and be silly and make up songs and shit. That would rock.  I just gonna make up my own friend that does that... I call them Toby, because Toby can be a boy or a girls name.  And Toby and I will have the best time ever.  Go Toby...Go Toby.. it's your birthday, have a party. Yayyyyyyyyyyyy... I need help.

       desperately seeking google   All I want in the world is to be able to be googled.  Is this too much to ask.  Yes, it may be sad to measure ones worth by whether or not you can be googled.  But someday I will meet somebody who is slightly obsessed with me, and how will he secretly stalk me if I can't be googled?  It's just so sad to type your name in, and have some cheese queen from Wisconsin pop up.

       Can't sleep   I woke up at 6:00 am, and I can't get back to bed, I really want to sleep. But instead I will just write some bullshit and hope that somewhere along the way I will get tired and go to bed. But that has yet to happen. I love working in a bar but the only problem is that my schedule is so different from everybody else's.  I saw a great movie yesterday, I saw  The Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind . It was really good, and I am so Kate Winslet in that movie. You just have to see it for yourself to find out why?  Although then I have to hear about how I'm not really like her.  I also like to think that there is a bit of the Bridget Jones in me also, and just a splash of drew Barrymore, in Never been kissed  .  But I think mostly I just have a whole lot of gay running through my veins. I'm such a romantic, but what I don't get is how I can be so jaded at the same time.  I'm am such a contradiction...

       Missy Moser's Great Night   I was working at the Red Bench last night, and had the best time. The most amazing thing happened, this group of english folks on Ten month tour of the world came in, and one of the couples proposed, it was so great, I love love.  It just get's me all girlie and happy.  I know that someday i will find that.  or I hope to find that. But if nothing else, at least I have really amazing friends...yay friends....sigh...somebody kill me please.

      Missy's Restored faith in men    I was working tonight at the Red Bench Bar, and we were having the same discussion we have many a night there.  We were talking about men and women and relationships.  This guy said something that I truly believe and was so happy to hear from a man. He said that men and women should just be able to be in a relationship where they really know each other.  That there doesn't have to be this power struggle and that maybe people don't have to take advantage of other people. And both people can be equally strong and weak.  He was right in saying that maybe this is too idealistic. But I really want to believe this.  I really want to apply this too my life.  But I have become jaded. I think this would only work if people were honest with one and other, and that honesty wasn't taken as a weakness. Or used to hurt the other person.  I wish it wasn't a power struggle. I don't think it has too be? I don't know how to find balance though?  I always end up giving up power, not because I'm weak, but because sometimes, I allow myself to be open and honest.  I don't know?  I just really want to be with somebody someday that I really know, who really knows me.  And we make each other laugh and they call me on my bullshit, and I won't be afraid to be open with them, because when I am they won't use it against me.  I'll be able to be flawed.  I won't have to sensor myself.  And I'll have all of this and still be attracted to them.  I know that may seem like a strange thing to say.  But I sometime have a fear putting friendship and love together.  But I suppose if I don't, then I will never really find this person I am looking.  But at least I know now that I'm not alone in thinking that, maybe if people were more willing to get to know a person for who they are?  And didn't judge them? And just let them be themselves?  Then maybe they could have a really amazing love for one and other? Just a hope? Maybe it is all just one big game?

       Stalking Blogs   Okay, So I was bored and was doing what I believe many other people do. Which is google people you used to date. Sort of a way of checking up on them without making the phone call. I hit the jackpot and found the blog of the one who got under my skin.  A part of me wondered, if I am so easy to find myself, then maybe he has found this blog?  Maybe he is reading this right now and going she's stalking me. Although, if he is reading this then that would mean he is stalking me also. Hmmm? Dual stalking... Doubtful...But it is something to think about.  Although, his blog is fairly general I didn't read that much, I just more or less skimmed though looking for my name and the phrase the one that got away.  But I don't put any specific names of people I like or have liked in this blog anyway. I'm sure at this point I'm not the one that got away, I'm the crazy girl who would email stalk him, and I'm sure many not so nice things.  Everybody has a bit of the psycho in them, we just need that special somebody to help bring that out of us.  This is why after a while we date safe people.  People whom we like "enough", who are funny "enough"...You don't fight too much with each other, and everything in the end is just very nice, not exciting, but nice.  Or you do what I do, and put the three month ticking time bomb on.  I don't get how people have year long anniversaries how does this happen?  I need to stop blog stalking, and I need to stop writing about this bullshit.

       I know who I am   I was in Taco Bell today having my usual burrito supreme and a taco, when I thought to myself, Who am I? I mean really!! Then I came to the epiphany that I am a Homosexual man and a Black woman trapped in a white woman's body. Well really a black woman's body with white skin. You may ask yourself why? Maybe you won't? I don't even know if anybody reads this bullshit anyway. I have had many a black person tell me I am blacker than most black people. Whether it is my ablility to cut a rug, or just simply the hair weaves. Maybe it's the ass. My booty is the bomb yo!!  But My temperament is more that of a gay man, the diva-esque qualities I possess. My love of the cock, my keen fashion sense and love of show tunes. Well, maybe the last two were pushing it...Because I fucking hate show tunes, and I'm fashionable if you consider whorish or whitetrash to be the in these days. Maybe I'm really a Mexican, I love leaf blowers and Mexican food.  I could never put myself in the Asian category for they are far superior to us.  Nevermind, I am back to where I was, I don't know who I am.  Is there a crack whore category, because I believe I may be somewhere along those lines.

       Happy to be alone or Just alone   For the first time in months I am fully alone,  I guess I was alone even if I had somebody, because the men I choose to be with are men that I don't really care for... Or if I like them back, they are never really that into me.  I'm sick of settling for back-ups.  But back-ups can be fun and emotionally safe. Which is great for an emotional retard such as myself.  But people get hurt when they are back-ups. I should know, I've been one. Which makes it even more strange I would go out and hurt somebody the same way I've been hurt.  I feel awful that I took advantage of some of them. It's not like I meant too, a part of you hopes you can develop feeling for these men, a chemistry.  But you can't force chemistry.  I really hurt a friend of mine thinking I could make myself feel something more than was there, and it never was. Now I've lost a friendship.  But I learned something, you can't force yourself to have feelings for somebody, just like you can't force somebody to have feelings for you.  The hope is, is you will be lucky enough to like somebody someday and have them like you back.  Sometimes I complain because the boys I like never like me back, but I forget about the boys where it's been reversed.  A lot of times you think they don't like you because you aren't good enough, pretty enough, yadda yadda yadda.  But sometimes it's nothing more than for some reason it's just not there for them.  I've dated men who I believed to be good looking, and nice, they were perfect really.  Maybe that was the problem, I love the underdog, I love flaws. But because I'm crazy, I want somebody crazy too. Not too crazy, just crazy enough.  I want somebody silly and passionate too. No more logical men.    I keep going back and fourth, because a part of me is tired of being the three month girl.  I'm sick of dating,  But I crush too easily and am way too flaky for a long term, so basically I'm stuck in the same place.  The problem is, there are so many interesting men in NYC, and each one brings out a quality in me I really like,  I'm 24, I should go out and have fun...This is the time when you learn what you like and what you don't like in another person.  So this is what I've learned so for about what I dislike and like.   Dislikes:  -too logical -Short (dick thing to say I know, but, it's true) -wants me to be his mother -too perfect (I don't want anybody that looks good on paper) -Too nice to me -not nice enough -not adventurous in bed -more flaky than I am -unable to open up   Likes:  -silliness: somebody who can act like a child with me. -When they call me on my bullshit -When they give me the butterflies -somebody who can be open with me -somebody who's creative and makes me think -they make me laugh -they have balance -They are impulsive -when they are a little loony -Most of all passionate.

       Mom Email    My Mom sent this too me and I thought it was sweet.  A part of me thinks it may be true.    Women are like apples on trees. The best ones are at the top of the tree.  Most men don't want to reach for the good ones because they are afraid of  falling and getting hurt. Instead, they just get the rotten apples from the  ground that aren't as good, but easy.......   So the apples at the top think something is wrong with them, when in  reality, they're amazing. They just have to wait for the right man to come  along, the one who's brave enough to climb all the way to the top of the  tree.   Share this with other women who are good apples, even those who have already  been picked!   And... Men are like a fine wine. They start out as grapes, and it's up to  women to stomp the crap out of them until they turn into something  acceptable to have dinner with.

       Preparing for the week ahead   So this is the first week I start my new job at the mandarin oriental hotel, I'm also trying to stay on at the red bench, we'll see how this goes.  I'm hoping I can in fact do both. It's good because I'll be busy working and I'll be making money, but I won't have time to spend it. So my hope is I'll get some bills under control. Hopefully start to build up some savings, so I may travel. I'm really hoping the people are nice at the Mandarin, I've been spoiled by the red bench. And now I'm so comfortable I fear going off to a new place.  I have to start acting like a lady again, I'm not really looking forward to this. I like that I'm silly and childish sometimes. It makes me happy.  But today I should just have fun, I should enjoy the beautiful weather. I think coffee at yaffa.  I could invite a friend.  People should call me, they should want to hang out with me, but people are lazy bitches. As am I.  I suppose there is no solution...Well, off to enjoy the sun.

       Celebrating people who aren't me sucks   I had to attend a birthday party tonight, It wasn't very much fun, I can say this because I know the person who's bithday I went too doesn't know I have a blog.  It was at the Bowery bar, which is really awful and over crowded.  It's too big. I'm used to the Bench which is like this little hole in the wall. but it's better. It's cosy, and less of a meat market.  At least I looked cute.

       Central Park   Oh what joy is mine...it's finally sunny outside and supposed to continue this way all weekend. YOu know what this means? Central park time.  Get a few of your close friends together, or just yourself and a book, maybe some good tunes, and a blanket and head on out to the park.  I love to just go alone and watch all the pretty people.  NOw is a wonderful time because all of the trees are starting to bud, and soon the flowers will make way to leaves, and when that begins to happen, the wind will blow, and the pedals on the trees will fly off and begin to dance around in the air like snow flakes.  It's the most beautiful thing.  I also love to bring my journal, yes I have a regular journal also, for being such a pathetic writer I sure do do a lot of it. There are things in life we all do, that we may not be good at, but they make us happy.  Just like there are things that make us miserable, but we happen to have a talent for.   This will be the best weekend to go the park, before the awful summer comes, I want to enjoy the spring. Hell maybe the sun will even find it's way to my pasty whiteness. Ivory complection I suppose is a better way of saying it.  Anyhoo, I'm off to my home away from home, the Red Bench.  Tomorrow, I'm off to the lovely park.

       I got the Job   I'm very happy, things seem too be going my way.  It's a cruel, cruel joke. I'll just enjoy everything as it happens.  I'm just waiting now for the other shoe to drop.  But until then I will just enjoy my life.  I will enjoy the new friends, and hope the new job goes well, and just have fun. I'm sure I'll be hit my a car.  But at least I'll be happy when it runs me over.

      Today was somewhat uneventful, unless you count my huge zit that I swear has developed its own zip code, I think this thing started talking to me today. I don't know what happened? I feel like I'm thirteen again.  This whole puberty thing seems never-ending. I went to go see "The Girl Next Door" and I don't know what it was, maybe it was lower expectations? But I thought it was actually pretty funny.  It's kinda like "American Pie" meets "Risky Business".  And that girl is really fucking hot.  Anyway after that I went to my bar and had a couple of drinks, hungout with the bar buddies and then came back home.  What an exciting life I do lead.  I wish I had somebody to give me back tickles right now...sigh...cross your fingers I get that job this week.

       Desperately seeking my shower head   I really miss my shower head, I don't want to be vulgar but it was just about the best thing to masturbate with ever.  It was warm right away and it had this thing where it would make the water pulse. I'm so sad, how I loved you loyal shower head.  You always made me cum. At least once when I used you, if not more. You would make my whole body tingle with your warm water tickles.  Now you are no more, I suppose in the end it was never really meant to be.  You spoiled me, you gave me everything I wanted and asked for nothing in return.  You were turned on right away, and I never had to buy you anything, not like my needy pink pocket rocket. You never needed me to buy you two shiny new platinum batteries for you to get going. But I believe we will meet again someday. A love like ours can not be broke. But it's just not the right time for us to be together again. Know that I love you.  You are always in my thoughts, although, I'm with pinky right now, I still think of you. My first and greatest love. See you someday sweet sweet shower head.

       Random   Do you ever have those days where you want to say something, but have no clue what it is? So I'm there right now, but I figure if I just write, something may come out of it? Doubtful but it could happen right? I was on the train the other day and I was thinking about how much I wished I could play the piano, and how when I was little, I used to pretend my toy chest was a piano.  I would play for hours, and I would imagine that I was playing for the whole world, and that people were so amazed that a girl so young could play so well.  Then I thought how much I miss Missy land. I loved to day dream, the only time I ever get that now is when I'm having Missy time in front of the mirror, this is where I put on music and stare at myself for hours, or I dance or play dress up, I've done this ever since I was a child.  My mother used to say there was never I mirror I couldn't stare at myself in. This is still true today. I think it's my favorite thing to do, is listen to music and dance in the mirror, or play dress up.  I don't know.  It's sort of silly for a 24 year old, but I'm also an actress, so maybe not so odd for that type of person.  I sometimes will stop in front of a mirror, and catch myself and go, "you know what? You really are beautiful."   Sometimes when nobody's home I'll make up songs,  I remember on the Fourth of July one year I was hanging out with this girl and I told her that I was a song writer, I was like seven or eight, and I sang her my songs.  And she made me go sing it to her parents, who I remember being very impressed by my song about, "how pretty the stars in the sky are, and how much the twinkle and shine, that it makes me want to cry."  But my music career was crushed by my mother when I belted out my rendition of a classic Michael Bolton song, and she began to Hysterically laugh at me. I could have been somebody, but my career was crushed. So now I can only sing alone.  Thanks Mom.  My other favorite thing to do is shower in the dark, it just helps me to think.  I wonder what odd things other people do when no one else is watching them?

      Today I did nothing, and I mean nothing. I woke up, made a sandwich, pre-washed some dishes, realized I no longer wanted to do dishes, watched  Sex and the city  on  On Demand .  Thought again about what character I would be, decided I wanted to be Samantha, because I really think Carrie is a whinny pussy, although I'm a bit of a pussy.  Not to mention every other girl in the world thinks they are Carrie. I've also come to grips with the fact that having sex is fun. I like it. I want to continue to have more of it.  Anyhoo, after that I thought, shit I'll take out the garbage, this was my workout for the day because I live in a third floor walk up.  After that more TV.  It was good though.  I guess? I've been going though this phase I go though every once in a while, where I can't be at home.  I don't know what it is but I wake up I get ready and then I leave and don't come back till it's late, then fall asleep and do it all over again.   I was thinking tonight that your birthday is like your own personal New Year, I'm not re-inventing the wheel with this thought...But this made me think about what I want from myself this year? And what was missing from last year? And I decided I needed to be more honest, and I needed to stop putting up with people's bullshit. So I'm going to start. Even if I lose people, or hurt people, I just don't want to keep going the way I've been going.  So I have some honest emails too write, just because I'm going to be honest doesn't mean I'm going to stop being a passive piece of shit. I mean one thing at a time.

       Access Denied    So one of my best friends who will remain nameless (Lisa) won't give me the address to her blog...Now this can only lead me too one conclusion... That she is a douche bag!! Why am I not worthy enough to view the greatness that is her blog? Maybe because she is talking smack about me on her blog? Yes, that's it!! She's talking about what a hoochie mama I am. While that may be true, I won't be mad about reading that, and there for I should receive full access to her blog. Unless she's writing about her sex life, then I don't need it. At any rate I should be allowed to view whatever it is she may be posting. You hear that Lisa!! I know you are reading this...Come on, I want the address!! If you don't give me the address in the next week, I wouldn't use your toothbrush. Not that I would clean the toilet with it or anything, But if you do see a clean toilet, I would be in search of a new brush. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

       Not such a Nice Girl   I can honestly say that a few years ago I was a really nice girl, and I think in some ways I may still be?  I think I'm a good friend and a good daughter.  I think I'm a terrible woman to date.  I'm fun, I am the fun girl. But I'm also curious, and I'm not the most loyal girl out there.  I think there was a time that I really wanted to be a good girl, and I put myself out there for somebody who, maybe in the long run, wasn't worth giving my heart too... I really cared for this person.  Why? I could never tell you...Maybe I saw what potential he had?  I was also a different person,  I hadn't dated any boys for about three years, and then I met him, and I wanted to force things, and I had this idea of how things could be or should have been, and they weren't and I freaked out.  I did stupid things, I cheated, I broke up with him, I tried to get him back.  But he didn't want me. I let him take advantage of me for over a year. Because it was safe, we were both virgins.  But the truth is, we were both children, and I had this overwhelming fear of growing up.    I can't say that that relationship made me a better person. I think in some ways? It made me a worse person too men... It's not like I'm out for revenge? I just can't open up anymore, I'm not willing to put myself out there right now.  So there for, I date men who are emotionally unavailable, or who are in other states and I never get to see them.  I have become so secretive.  I would love to find somebody someday, whom I have this amazing spark with, and there's passion and love, who I can be silly with and who won't take advantage of my feelings, and I won't do that to them.  I want to be an honest person again.  I should no longer linger in relationships that make me unhappy.  But I fear real love like some fear the plague.  But I should not hurt people the way I was hurt.  Just like I should not allow myself to be hurt.    In some ways I wish I could go back in time and be patient, and just have fun and not put any pressure on the relationship I had with this boy, and maybe it could have fully developed, and then fully and naturally failed. Instead of being manufactured, manipulated, and then trashed.  I guess I am partially to blame,  I could point fingers and blame others, but in the end... I put myself through this, and we all go though it. I just am going through this later than most people.   Maybe I'm supposed to just date and be an asshole and just have fun?  Maybe I was supposed to mess up a lot the first time around just to learn what not to do.  I'm sorry to write about this, I'm not being deep so much as I am just venting, and still thinking about this person.  This person who honestly and for some sick and unknown reason still holds a piece of my heart.  Which is wrong. But no one has ever been able to control their heart.  We often care the most for people who give us the least.    I talk about this shit way too much, I really need to get a better hobby.  I need to start acting and being creative?  How does one start to become a better person? fuck if I know? I guess to start being honest and stop playing games.  I'm going back to the old me. And I'm starting today.

      When Missy met Google  Yes, it's true, I can be googled!! What joy is mine? For so long I have tried to stalk myself and have come up un successfully.  But now not only can you find me, but I am at the top of the list.  This makes me somebody.  Although, now other people have to think I am worth learning about, and let's be honest...I'm a cute girl... But I can assume there will be little to no stalking.  Sigh....

       Happy Birthday to me   I must say I had a lovely birthday, I can't thank my friends enough for making it so. We went to the Red Bench, and I had like 12 cosmos, I was very happy and very drunk. I had a good time flirting with the boys and just being my normal cute self.  I must stop talking to the boys, but I can't help it. I'm making up for lost time. Believe me I have plenty of lost time to make up for, after all I didn't start dating till I was 19. I didn't lose my virginity till I was 23 so I have a lot of making up to do, if I'm going to be that slut everybody thinks I'm going to be. I'm am now the young age of 24.  Yay for me.  I am happy for the first time in a while. I also may have found a new job working in a hotel, which means benefits. Which should put my lovely mother at ease.  Not to mention I am led to believe there is a bit of money to be made, and I can't complain about that now can I?  I do believe 24 is going to be a darn good year.

       More painful, being the spanky or the spanker?  Now everybody that knows me knows that I am a masochist, I would like to believe that someday I could crossover into sadist land, but yesterday was not the day.  I was visiting my brother's friend's house and the very boy I was talking about two posts ago was there. And he was very, very drunk and passed out on my brother's friend's bed.  so we were all giving him a hard time, and I found a belt on the ground, so of course I start to joke around that I should spank him with it. But I stop...then, my little brother is like "do it!!"  So I cracked that leather to the old buttocks.  and then covered my face and giggled like a naughty Asian prostitute. Thinking he was in pain, I was about to put the belt down and go about my business, when out of a half drunken slumber, what should I hear?  "HARDER!!" ..."What?"  I thought to myself. I laugh because I think he's joking, then he's like "HARDER!!"  I say "I can't" and he's like "Harder!!" again... So I start being silly and tell him to call me "mistress" and and I smack the belt again against his firm tight ass. But he still wants it harder. "HARDER, HARDER, HARDER"  he keeps saying... But as I'm whacking him It's actually starting to freak me out and becomes more painful for me to do, because I don't want to hurt him yet he seems to enjoy the pain I'm giving to him.  I start to get turned on a little bit by how forceful he is being in his wanting of the punishment, that I have become to reluctant to give him. It was odd because I felt we were both being the masochist. It was odd, and even more strange is the whole thing is on video tape.  That should be fun to show my children someday. I'm a naughty naughty little girl...TeeHee

       Guest blog done by Debra.  So for my birthday this year, (which is September 23, Missy!), my friends bought me tickets to the White Stripes concert, because I love Jack White.  I waited in line all day long, in scorching hot sun so I could be up front and see every drop of sweat coming off his head.  Like at every concert all the assholes behind you, who aren't dedicated enough to take a whole day off of work and sit outside for six hours before a concert starts, start pushing forward and crushing all of us dedicated fans.  One thing lead to another and girls had to start being pulled out of the audience because they were passing out.  Well, the girl in front of me got pulled out, leaving a space in the front row, but this stupid girl next to me that had been fighting me for position all night long got in front of me, and I got pushed back to the third row.  The worst part about it, is that Jack White winked at her during "Pretty Good Looking for a Girl."  THAT BITCH STOLE MY WINK!!!

      I have a crush...an old new one. I used to work with this kid at the movie theatre when I was a projectionist.  I had a crush on him then and I well... moved away, and I also never thought I would have a chance with the boy in a million years.  Not to say there is a shot now, but boy would I love to have a little tryst with him in the few days that I'm in town for. He's just as good looking as he was when I last saw him.  I guess, well acording to my little brother, who also happens to be his best friend, said that he at one point used to have a crush on me. So I say fuck it!! if this is true? then we should yadda yadda, why not? I leaving soon. I'm a girl, he's a boy, we're both pretty...Let's let the games begin right? let the good times role.  Oh well, at least if nothing else I have some eye candy until I leave.

       It worked!!   I'm so happy, I went home to Colorado to surprise my mother on her birthday, and it worked out brilliantly.  Klea, Tory, Lisa and I woke up early and got ready to surprise my mother at a garage sale, a past time she has had since before I was born. Klea, dropped me off at a home with Lisa, and Tory... and Lisa had a camcorder ready in hand to record the whole event.  We went to house that was selling a Harley, knowing that my mother loves harley's we knew it would be irresistible.  So I hid behind the harley and waited for Klea to come back with my mother and give me the signal, which was her honking her horn when she rounded the corner. As I hid behind the harley I could hear my mother's voice, and I felt overjoyed.  I flew up and yelled "happy birthday" much to mother's shock and happiness, she was so glad to see me, and was so shocked, which is a feat all on it's own because my mother is pretty un-shockable. I was just so happy to see her, she looked so beautiful. It was such fun to have a day out with the girls, we haven't been garage saling in years. I had the best time with klea, Mom, and Tory.  Tory's like me she grew up with all of these crazy women.  I'm sure someday we too will be these crazy women. It's just so nice to be home. I woke up this morning and looked at the mountains, and was just so overwhelmed by how beautiful the are. I also found out that my brother john and his girlfriend Melissa are coming out this week, which means for the first time in a long time we will all be together again.  I'm so glad I gave myself a week, I feel blessed.

      For the first time in a long while not saying anything won't get me into trouble.  I have a secret, but I'm sure this very secret will make some people very happy. It's killing me to keep this secret,  but all will be known in the next few days. I'm telling you, if this works, it will be the coolest thing I've done in a while.

      We're going to try something new.. Instead of finding myself in hilarious and awkward situations and then dutifully recording the incidents in my daily Blog for all of my fans and admirers to read, gossip, and aspire to, my fans will write entries for me to live out. They narrate, I follow. This weeks guest author of my fabulous life is Nick, a longtime and die hard friend and moderate liberal (fiscal conservative) and equestrian. Here goes:  Today I thought to myself, while pining over the orlando bloom picture I cut out from april's Cosmo Girl and still have in my wallet, I thought to myself... "...can there really be only one missy? am i truly one of a kind, or can i be imitated, perhaps even duplicated.. Maybe there is indeed an exact replica of me (apart from Samantha on Sex in The City) roaming the streets of manhattan, searching for purpose. Maybe theyre yearning to find me. Who knows? What if they were prettier than me? If I had sex with them, would it be incest or masturbation? As a lover of both, I told my delicate self not to fret; because I know I have the power to eliminate her. How dare she? Only I could cry at the death of a serial killer. I want a pony, I want a party dress, I want a party at the American Girl restaraunt, with a marzipan  cake that looks just like me. Or her. Its ironic, kind of like a sad clown.   Loving me,  You.

       Tea, Wine, the Rain, and puddle jumping   Last night I had the best time I've had in New York in so long... It was so simple, good people good conversation and some laughs. Some friends of mine and I went to Yaffa, and Sat outside and just talked about odd random things, like why we are all psycho...and other bullshit. But the best part was, was it was pouring rain outside, and we were out there sitting underneath a cheap tarp, just breathing it all in and talking and getting wet, and not giving a shit.  Then when we left we just walked in the rain, and puddle jumped, and then the night ended in what I would say was somewhat un-expected...Fun...But un-expected.  I hope there are many more nights like that one. That's all I can say. So simple and yet so fun...

       Tnuc Yeknom   Do you ever notice that no one ever calls you unless it's the worst possibe time for them to call, Like last night I was sick as a dog, and my phone kept ringing at like 4:30 am and then again at like 4:40 am.  Now I won't say any names, but I know this person knew I wasn't feeling well, Maybe they called to check up on me? But we don't check up on the sick girl at 4:30am... Logicaly you know I'm sleeping...Trying to feel better. The harsh sound of my phone ringing is not what I want to hear when I'm trying to stay asleep for fear if I wake up I will feel that I am sick. At least passed out you feel nothing.  People do crap like that all the time. I'm sure it's not intentional and normally it wouldn't be an issue, because I am often up until a late hour. But if you know I am ill, because earlier in the evening you told me to feel better, then don't call me at 4:30am...drunk or no drunk...no good. tnuc yeknom...

      So I was given some HOMEWORK by a friend of mine, which I am sadly having the worst time with...My homework was to stop putting as many question marks in my blog.. My best friend Lisa has told me the same thing.  but the problem is the question mark is such a part of my writing style. If a bad writer can possibly have a style.  this is really sad...one time I wrote this fake "Missed Connection" on craigslist about myself, and you want to know how my best friend lisa knew it was me...all of the damn question marks.  Although, how lame is it to write yourself a missed connection anyway.  I'm such a ding-a-ling.. Maybe someday I'll be cool? Am I cool now and just don't know it? Damn it!! I did it again..F-it..I'm out

       Nose pickers   Now I know everybody and there grandmother picks their nose, but some days you see these people and it's like they get some sort of sexual enjoyment out of having there finger up there nose. I saw this man on the train the other day and he was doing the dig, for like five minutes...Finally he just snotts in his hand, and then proceeds to roll the snott between his thumb and his index finger for what felt like an hour, and I'm going, where is this man going to dispose of this? I'll tell you where, right on the standing pole. I nearly threw up.  Who does that?

       Naked Time   Man I wish I was a child still, I remember when I was little and I would always be naked, like from the age two to four, I did not wear any cloths... I also believe I told other children that if they wanted to be my friend they too had to be either naked or half naked. I was always willing to compromise. So as I would look through the old family album, I would see me naked in my barbie pool, naked taking a pee in the minnow bucket. (I think at that age I thought anything that had a hole in the middle of it was my bathroom.) Naked in the linen closet. And the ever so glamorous toilet shot of me naked, wearing a Santa hat.  I was such a balsy girl in my early life...Man I just miss being a kid...Good times

       I don't want to go!!    Arg, I have been invited yet again to the Bowery Bar, I don't want to go, but must go...For the same reason as before, celebrating somebody who isn't myself.  Which as I previously stated...SUCKS. Now I have to deal with this meat market of people that I don't know when all I want to do is just go to my small little bar in SOHO, the "red bench".  Where I'll have people that I already know there and have good conversations with about stuff other than, where the person works, and lives, and pretending to care that somebody lives in Brooklyn or the upper-west side. Or that you teach French to the hearing impaired.  I could care less. Now I have to endure this, and why? Because it's for a very good friend of mine who's in town from Norway, he's one of my favorite people, so I will go to this awful place. I don't have to be happy about it though. All in all things are going well. Going to central park tomorrow, then to work, should be fun...

      Obsession free  It's odd to feel sad that I have nothing really to obsess about.  I've always had something.  Whether it was stripper movies, or the rocky horror picture show, hedwig, or cleaning products, like Oxy clean, or my un-dying love of soft scrub, which truly cleans any surface, not that I use them all the time, but when I do choose to clean? These are the products of champions. I'm always thinking about boys, but I used to be preoccupied by the thought of one, now I have a few, some I like more then others, but none really worth my time obsessing over.  Not because these men aren't great, but because nothing will ever happen with these men that I like... and I'm tired of putting all this effort into something that's never going to happen. I've finally learned you can't force anything. I guess I'm becoming less of a masochist.  I doubt it's gone.  I'm sure I'm in need of a good mind fuck... I would love to not be numb for the rest of my life. I just want a few little obsessions again. Like I used to love to play with make-up and hair...now...not so much.  I used to collect movies. I used to right honest emails. I used to drive by my ex's house and give him the finger.  I used to kiss girls,  I used to dance anywhere and not care, okay well I still do that.  I just need one little obsession, I do have one kinda, I dig these new disposable Palmolive dish towel, which is frickin brilliant.  But that will only take me a month to get over, give me some new ones..Help a sister out. New obsessions....Give me ideas

       I fucking hate people   I deal with rich assholes all day long, and the one thing I've learned about rich people is that, they are cheap!!! And I also don't get why rich people treat you as if you owe them something.  I want to shoot this one family, everybody hates waiting on them, because they are demanding and cheap. Like they make us serve them breakfast in the lounge, which may not seem like a big deal, but we don't serve breakfast... It's a huge pain in the ass.  And then on top of that, after we bust our asses to give these people what they want, they thank us by leaving us maybe a 10% tip. I hope this family dies.  I really do. Not to mention, there are these girls at my work who talk so much shit behind people's backs, it's like being in High school again.  Or like being friends with my Ex's friends.  This group, would talk so much shit behind the other's back. It was funny because the so called "leader" was the worst about it, and everybody would tell her their secrets. She was what I like to call a fire starter. She likes the drama I guess. It's not as though drama can't find you.  The group wasn't bad really.  I think there's a lot of love there. But it was very toxic for me.  I did make one really good friend out of that group.  But I fucked it up, well the dating fucked it up.  WE just shouldn't have crossed the friendship line.  But I'm sure he's better off without me.  To be honest, I was some what toxic for him.  You can have a wonderful time with somebody, but know it won't last forever.  I did have a great time... Even if I never talk to the kid again. I had a great time, and learned a lot. So you can't ask for much more,right?  I guess we are all dickes to some body? I guess it's all just karma huh...

         That's my Mom, is she a babe or what.... She's going to kill me for putting a picture of her on the site. But I love her, I think she's the most beautiful woman in the world. That's my Mom's friend Michael. He's a great guy and a dirty hippie like myself.

      Then there was Blog...  I don't know if anybody ever knows why I decided to start a blog. It's sort of sad, like so many things I do in my life.  I basically started it so I could be stalked, so if somebody is curious about me, they could just google my name and badda-bing badda-boom, they have my blog. But then I really started to enjoy it. Like it's nice to have a place to vent and people can read it or not. The great thing is as fucked up as I am, there are people just as fucked up in the head. I love being a misfit.

      The need to see the Ex.....  I don't know if I am the only loser who dwells over the loss of an Ex, But sometimes I just have those days where all I want to do is try and get in contact with this person.   But it seems so silly.   Why do I always want one more chance?  Wasn't the first time around painful enough...  This is a person who brings out the worst in me.  Yet all I want to do is too run into this man in a bar or something.  I want to see him and see some sort of transformation. This is the kind of bullshit I think about when I should be getting valuable sleep in... Like now, I should be fucking asleep by now... Okay, I'm going....I'm going...

       Rant   I'm so dreading the next few days, I have to work at my job and work a lot, which is great I have to make money, but this means very little time for me, I have the whole apartment to myself and I can't even take advantage of it. I really want to go and get a gym membership, but when would I have time to go?  I want to start on other tasks like maybe taking an acting class, or a dance class, something a little more creative then just going to work and kissing rich ass for most of my day. Which, is really the best part of my day, let me tell you. But if I'm not working, I'm looking for something to do.  Or sleeping, I love sleep, I work so hard to get it.  I also need to find a new crush, all of my prospects right now are ridiculous. And in the long run not really worth my time. But aren't those the best ones to go for, the pain free kind.  The kind you will never get hurt by, because you already know what will be the failure of the relationship.  So you date "the dreamer", "the psycho", "the child", "the un-attractive funny guy", "the attractive man, who isn't funny, or even that interesting, but he sure is nice to look at", "the guy who has a girlfriend you know he will never leave", "Lust after the man who lives in another state", "the Mormon, whom, even if he wasn't Mormon would still turn out to be gay" "the drug addict", "the virgin", "the mamma's boy", "the boy still in love with the ex-girlfriend he hasn't talked too for two years", "the emotional retard", "the pussy", "the guy who is too nice, who let's you walk all over him" ...There are so many really and I've dated most of them. See...See...I need a damn hobby...This is not a hobby. I must go to work now, sigh...

      The world looks so different after a Vacation.  I don't know if it's just me but every time I leave to go on Vacation, I have this overwhelming fear that when I come back the whole world is going to fall apart. And when I come back I will find that I have no friends, because everyone will realize that they hate me.  That my job will fire me, and that I will be left with nothing.  I know that this is a silly fear that I shouldn't even worry about, but at the same time I can't help it. We all have silly fears. I just happen to have a lot. But at least I cover it somewhat well.

      The death of pinky   Dearest Pinky,  I don't know how I'm going to go on without you,  I've been seeing you for about three years now, and we've had a lot of fun together.  But the other day we were together, and I don't know what happened, you were humming our favorite tune, when all of the sudden, you went silent.  I started to shake you and smack you, I couldn't let that be it...why!!! why did you stop talking to me? was it something I said, did I use you for too long.  Did you want energizer instead of durocells.  I would have given you that, but you never complained before, and now you're gone.  What am I to do? I loved you.  Nobody took me too the places you did, you spoiled me.  Was it because I was talking about showerhead again? did you get jealous? You can love two things you know....now I'm left with nothing but lefty, and lefty is lazy.  I mean I should be happy we had three loving years together. That's more than I can say for most things in my life.  I'll just remember the little things, like watching  movies together.  You loved forrest hump, and Anlylize that ass, or your favorite,  When harry met black beauty.  You thought it was so funny when harry was telling that horse about how men and horses can never really be friends because...OH GOD WHY!!!! why did you die on me? it's not fair, I didn't even have any warning....You were all like "ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ, ZZZZZ, ZSsssssssssssssssss.................then nothing.....silence....Goodbye pinky... I know you are in a better place.  i know you only want the best for me.  You want me to find a new pinky,  I will, I find a new one on friday, but I won't forget about you.  There's only one pinky....  All of my Love, Missy

      My favorite things past and present   I've been watching the movie "The Sound of Music" a lot lately because it helps me sleep.&nbsp; I hate the quiet, and I just got a TV for my room, so what I do is, I put in a movie and set the TV off timer for like 40 min.&nbsp; Then I just pass right out to "the sound of the music", but the trick is it has to be a happy film, because if it's not you have the wacky dreams, and I've found I sleep best when I put in this film, but I always fall asleep to song, "favorite things" So I was thinking today, what are a few of my favorite things?   1. Writing my blog  2. Hanging out at Virgin or Barnes and noble  3.&nbsp; Drinking coffee or Tea and shooting the shit with close friends.  4. Talking about sex openly  5. Stalking my ex  6.

Sunday Dinner's with Mom,&nbsp;Chris,&nbsp;John, and then Klea and&nbsp;her kids,&nbsp;Tory, Taylor, and Tanner,&nbsp; Michael, and who ever else would pop buy.&nbsp; Even my Sunday dinners here with Nick and Lisa.&nbsp;  26.&nbsp; back&nbsp;tickles  27.&nbsp; David's head butts  28. Sake's butt&nbsp;  29. Just when Ketler, fatter, Sake, and Myself are together...with the bonus of a lizzy for added humor.  30. Every time I go too Red Robin, I say it's somebody's birthday just to get the free desert.  31.&nbsp;My Family  32.&nbsp; My mom's cooking  33.&nbsp;&nbsp; Debra's Laugh, still the best laugh ever.  34.&nbsp; My late night talks with Lisa.  35. IM ing people.  36.&nbsp; looking at myself in the mirror  37. my mouth, my hair, my eyes.  38. Cursing and acting like a boy.  39. Falling in lust  40. Kissing  41. Watching porn (even better if somebody is with you to give you a hand)  42.&nbsp; Making people Laugh.  43. Dancing  44. Acting  45. People just showing up out of the blue.  46. Random phone calls from somebody you never expected to hear from.  47.&nbsp; Going to the movies alone.  48.&nbsp; Going to screenings at Colony square.  49. That sound your shoes make when walking on sand or dried leaves.  50.&nbsp; When people get excited when they talk about something.   I'm gonna stop there for now, I could think of 100 more, but we'll save that list for later.

       That Crazy Missy    I don't know what it is, but I have this boy I've liked for forever it feels,&nbsp;and&nbsp;no matter what I do I can not move on, I just can't, I just keep going out with boys,&nbsp; I keep hoping this one will be the one that makes me stop caring.&nbsp; But they never are,&nbsp; after a while I become numb, and then the boys lose interest in me because I've become cold.&nbsp; Then I try to hold onto them, because I need a distraction, because I don't want to think about him anymore.&nbsp; Sometimes, I go months not thinking about him at all... I think maybe this time is it, I'm over him, I really am... I can try and go out and have a normal relationship.&nbsp; Wishful thinking I guess...I even try to think about it logically, because the guy&nbsp;isn't that great.&nbsp; Like it's like that Shakespeare sonnet about, this man whose in love with this woman, who isn't perfect, but he still loved her, and that's how he is,&nbsp; I just like all of his flaws, and believe me when I say there are quite a few of them.&nbsp; But he's human.&nbsp; he's real, and he's nuts, and childish, and he can't talk to me to save his life, he drinks too much,&nbsp; but he has the best smell ever, and he's a romantic in theory, not so much in practice, he's not very impulsive. But he is passionate.&nbsp; He knows how to grab a girl and kiss her hard.&nbsp; He's obnoxious and sneaky, and just fascinating to me.&nbsp; Just such a waste of time for me too wish for... Where as I am not so interesting to him, and apparently too sexual... which is bullshit, and anybody who actually knows me, knows that.&nbsp; But he's waiting for this dream girl, and by dream I do really mean dream, he has had about five or six dreams about her and believes he will find&nbsp;her someday, and for his sake I hope he does, I really do... I should really stop obsessing over somebody that in the end isn't worth my time.&nbsp; I have to let one of the nice guys have a chance.&nbsp;&nbsp; I shouldn't waste somebody else's time like he wasted mine, or how I wasted my time I should say...How does somebody begin to let go of something you've hoped for for so long, I feel like I'm quitting. like I just didn't try, but if I try any harder the boy is gonna get a restaining order....I'm gonna stop being an asshole, too myself and to those around me.......in like a month or four...

       Kiss Me Hard!!!     &nbsp;   Maybe it's just me that feels this way, but why are men so passive these days? I want a cave man, I want a guy who will just throw me on the bed and make mad, passionate, love to me. I don't want these men who are too afraid to even go and grab the boobs,&nbsp; the boob grab is basic...I want a guy who knows what he likes and just goes for it...I want it to be like two animals, it's should be carnal and hot and passionate.&nbsp; I want a man with a little throw down, dammit!!!&nbsp; I just want passion.&nbsp; I just want every time you are with somebody to be like the last time you are going to be with them, and make it that much more raw and powerful. So you can really breath in every moment of that person. I just want to make-out, and I want to make-out long, hard, and passionately...GRRRRRR...no more of those nice sweet kisses, boring...kiss me like it's the last time you'll ever see.&nbsp; Push me up against a wall, with your pelvis pushing into mine, and your hand casually sliding under my shirt.... Come on! Is that so hard!?

       Being Drunk doesn't mean you don't know what you're doing...     &nbsp;  I always find it funny when people say something to you when they are drunk or whatever...But none of that ever counts because supposedly they didn't have control of what they were saying.&nbsp; Which is such a load of shit, if nothing else,&nbsp; most people only give you a straight answer when they are drunk...God knows I can't lie very well sober,&nbsp; and I definitely can't lie drunk.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are we still letting people use this excuse? I guess so we can still use it ourselves someday.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose the difference is when you are drunk you say how you really feel, not how you should logically feel... Many people are&nbsp;more logical than impulsive.&nbsp; I just don't buy it as a valid excuse, because I know when I use it, I'm full of shit....I think most people are full of shit also...

      I was thinking about how much i miss breakfast, like I love breakfast...eggs, bacon, toast, i love it all.  Anytime of day is good with me.  I wish I had eggs right now, and it was three in the morning, and I was at a diner...I was at the lyric and smoking a cigarette, and talking about crawling in the pussy, and laughing at midgets,  Making fun of asians  "oh no, i don't know?  teeheehee" if you know me? you know the voice that goes with that, so you know that what I just said was damn funny...because I am really cute and funny..I am so cute, I am so cute, everybody loves me, I am so cute...Sometimes at night I slip in a little porn and like to tease myself, I like to leave myself texts and not respond to me...and you know why, because I don't like small children, I think most dogs are gay and most men are dogs, so by that logic most men are gay right? LIke you know anything, you like poodles and trees that say "hey, look at me, I like yellow" and you're like "how can you like yellow? you're a tree?" and the tree's all like, "I'll kill you" you are shocked by this statement, because you always felt trees were peaceful and fun loving, but how wrong you were, trees are the new black people and they have been opressed to damn long, believe me when i say there will be a punishment, and it won't be pretty.   I think we just have a problem with the color brown, it's just not a good color. I mean I'm sure if it wasn't for blacky at m&m we would have no browns in that color assortment.  you know why we don't like brown, it's because we think of shit when we think of brown, and nobody but the germans like shit.  Man, I should sleep, i think I should go and ride the dream pony to lala land...take me away pony...

       Great Time   The other day I went out with this friend of mine I used to go to high school with.  We were acquaintances in high school. But anyhoo, what happened was: I was in Taco Bell about three months ago or so, and see this guy who looks just like this kid I knew from high school. So I keep staring at him and staring, and I'm working out the script in my head..."Hey, so this may be strange, but did you go too broomfield high school?" or maybe "I don't know if you remember me? I auditioned for one of the one acts you wrote in High School...and didn't get the part" (which by the way, has been discussed, and it turns out I was cast, but the dirty Nazi we had for a drama teacher decided she didn't want me cast in that one act, but in another one act.) But what ended up happening was, I walked up to him and said "Dan?" and he was like "Missy?"...so yadda yadda he gave me his number said we should hang out.  So I call him and he never calls me back!!! Then I forget about it and three months later I get a call from the kid. So I give him shit for not calling me back. and then we set up a little lunch date at taco bell...We meet up and it's great!! I laughed the whole time... Like my cheeks hurt by the end of day, and we saw Anchorman, which was comic fricken gold. I just had a lovely day...I think I made a new friend.  Although I feel bad because I don't remember us hanging out that much in high school, and he claims we hung out a bit more than what I thought we did, but he said he's going to leave it alone, because he doesn't want me to feel like an asshole for not remembering what he believed to be the greatest friendship he ever HAD...Okay I just made that part up...But either way I'm glad I got to hang out with a cool new/old person.  I mean it sucked!! I had the worst time ever, so bad I wrote an entire blog about it...I'm never hanging with that douche bag again..

       Earl Grey vs. Coffee   I'm in this odd phase where I really like tea. I've never been a tea drinker myself, but now I just can't get enough of the stuff.  I feel like a trader to the coffee drinkers of the world.  It's not to say I'm done with coffee.  I love coffee, coffee will always be my main love. But, sometimes you have to change it up a bit. I've been flirting a little bit with chamomile, lemon verbena, jasmine pearl, lychee green, But my favorite...The joy of my life right now is Earl Grey, with just a little sugar and some milk you have what I like to refer to simply as "a little slice of heaven."  It's just great to sit outside with your friends at "Yaffa cafe" with some smokes and My earl grey and good conversation. It's just so relaxing. Listen Coffee, I haven't left you, I don't want you to be hurt. I know that you don't understand, because I say I love you and can't live without you one minute, and then the next thing you know I'm hanging out with Earl.  We're laughing and having a good time, we're talking about philosophy, and relationships. You remember there was a time when It was just you I would talk too. I love you coffee, I do, but you get a little needy sometimes.  Just because I'm hanging out with another hot beverage, doesn't mean I don't want you.  You know you'll always be my baby.  Earl Grey is just a phase, we don't have the history you and I do. So you don't have to worry we'll be together again.  Remember coffee, if you love something set it free, if it comes back it's meant to be...

      this is a friend, updating for missy.  doing a guest spot, if you will.  so where shall i begin?  i'd like to share with you all a little story of me.  and who i was back in the day.  let me take you back to about 1993 or so.  eighth grade.  damn, eighth grade sucked.  i had no friends, the ones i did were weird and lame.  by some amazing stroke of luck i landed a part in the school play.  a *good* part.  the play was "a midsummer night's dream" and i was playing helena.  ace, no?  so it was pretty cool, i got to socialize with some cool kids for the first time.  but people still didn't really pay attention to me.  i don't know what i wanted...but whatever it was i didn't get it.  i kept most of the same friends...  i remember the first time missy called me and asked me to spend the night at her house.  i was kind of shocked.  it was totally on a whim.  we had never really hung out before.  my mom wouldn't let me go over there and i was bummed...but then she said missy could come stay over at our place.  it was like at that moment we became best friends.  i really believe to this day that missy brings out my best qualities more than anyone.  i don't know exactly how our friendship evolved the way it did, but we had become this sort of duality...you couldn't have one without the other.  but that's just the way it was on the outside.  other people didn't see how trully cool we were to each other.  the didn't see us in bathrobes, sitting on the trampoline and eating pasta.  i guess i should have a point with this.  i really don't.  my only point is that you get the opportunity for a childhood friend only so many times in your life.  i really only had one chance.  i jumped on it.  and childhood friends are the coolest.  missy i love you.  i hope this is an ok guest blog.....

       All the little things   So I got sick this week and lost my voice, some might say that's a blessing.  I also got an ear and sinus infection...Well, I called my mother, because I'm pathetic and told her to do "the thing" and she did,  she sang my favorite lullaby as only my mother can sing it: "Close your eyes, go to sleep, go to sleep lit-tle Missy, do be do, do be do, hmmmhmmmhmmm." and that how she sings it to me, because she never knew the words to the song. I love that, because it turns the song into something that is just my mother, it's a little thing that makes the song special. My mother also used to make me her special scrambled eggs, when I got sick which always used to make me feel better. And she would give me back tickles. Well she always gave me back tickles, but when I was sick she wouldn't fall asleep while rubbing my back; forcing me to shake my back to wake her up again to continue to rub my back.  When I was sick she would give me a perfect mommy back rub. She also always put a cooling wash cloth on my forehead.   When my Mom got ill I was the only one who would take care of her.  When she would get a migrain, I would rub her head till she fell asleep, and give her a cold wash cloth. I would make Christopher dinner, and be mommy till mommy felt better. This is one of my Mom's favorite stories to tell:  One time my Mom had this awful migrain, and when you get a migrain, on top of just the basic pain of the headache, you also get sensitivity too light and sound. Well My little brother was being a shit, and he was running around and being loud, and I knew he was bothering Mom, she needed to rest, and Bubba wouldn't shut up.  So basically, I got duct tape...I tied him up from head to toe.  And then put the duct tape over his mouth, and left him in his room with the door shut...Well my mother is sleeping and all of a the sudden she hears "Mmmmmm.... Mmmmmmm.... Mmmmmm"  she looks up and sees my little brother tied up.  She takes off the duct tape, and asks what happened, and Chris says "Missy tied me up."  I'm watching TV down stairs at this point. Not knowing he has hobbled his way to Mom's room, when I hear My Mother's Voice..."Melissa Ann"...These very words tell me that I'm in trouble and she knows I tied up Bubba, but she doesn't know why?  So I make my way up stairs to her room. I run in and tell her why I did it.  I told her "He wouldn't shut up!...I knew she was in pain, and needed to rest. Christopher wouldn't be quiet, so I made him be quiet!"  My mother just thought that was the sweetest thing ever. And Bubba ended up getting in trouble not me.    It's sad though, now that I live in NYC, and Mom's still in Colorado, nobody takes care of us when we are sick.  But we found a way to make each other feel better from far away.  I'll sing my version of the lullaby, and Mom will sing her's and it will make us feel better.  I'll sing "Close your eyes; go to sleep; go to sleep lit-tle Mommy...do be do...do be do...Hmmmm Hmmmm hmmmm..."  and she'll sing hers and for some reason, it still brings me peace when I'm ill. It helps me sleep that much faster, and get better that much sooner...I think it my favorite song ever.

       Jolene  by Dolly Parton  Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, I'm begging of you please don't take my man. Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Please don't take him just because you can.   Your beauty is beyond compare, With flaming locks of auburn hair, With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green. Your smile is like a breath of spring; Your voice is soft like summer rain, And I cannot compete with you, Jolene.   He talks about you in his sleep, An' there's nothing I can do to keep, From crying when he calls your name, Jolene. And I can easily understand, How you could easily take my man, But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene.   Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, I'm begging of you please don't take my man. Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Please don't take him just because you can.   You could have your choice of men, But I could never love again. He's the only one for me, Jolene. I had to have this talk with you: My happiness depends on you, And whatever you decide to do, Jolene.   Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, I'm begging of you please don't take my man. Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Please don't take him even though you can.   Jolene. ( Jolene.)

      That's my favorite story, it's by Shel Silverstein. I'm sure most people know that. I just wanted that story to be on my blog.

       THE GIVING TREE   Once there was a giving tree who loved a little boy. And everyday the boy would come to play Swinging from the branches, sleeping in the shade Laughing all the summer’s hours away. And so they love,  Oh, the tree was happy. Oh, the tree was glad.   But soon the boy grew older and one day he came and said, "Can you give me some money, tree, to buy something I’ve found?" "I have no money," said the tree, "Just apples, twigs and leaves." "But you can take my apples, boy, and sell them in the town." And so he did and  Oh, the tree was happy. Oh, the tree was glad.  But soon again the boy came back and he said to the tree, "I’m now a man and I must have a house that’s all my home." "I can’t give you a house" he said, "The forest is my house." "But you may cut my branches off and build yourself a home" And so he did. Oh, the tree was happy. Oh, the tree was glad.  And time went by and the boy came back with sadness in his eyes. "My life has turned so cold," he says, "and I need sunny days." "I’ve nothing but my trunk," he says, "But you can cut it down And build yourself a boat and sail away." And so he did and  Oh, the tree was happy. Oh, the tree was glad.  And after years the boy came back, both of them were old. "I really cannot help you if you ask for another gift." "I’m nothing but an old stump now. I’m sorry but I’ve nothing more to give" "I do not need very much now, just a quiet place to rest,"  The boy, he whispered, with a weary smile. "Well", said the tree, "An old stump is still good for that." "Come, boy", he said, "Sit down, sit down and rest a while." And so he did and  Oh, the trees was happy.  Oh, the tree was glad.

       Moments   I know that I think too much about the little things, and that in some silly way maybe that is wasting time. But I like to enjoy the little moments in life. I think life is about people and making connections, and really getting to know people and having them really know you. I love when you first meet somebody, anybody, man, woman, child, and they share something with you, and maybe only you. Because, if people are anything like me, then they give a different piece of themselves to different people, and then that person has something no one else has. They may not even know, you may not even know you gave it to them...But the beauty of people is how different we all are.  Every person you come across in your life is going to bring out something different in you.  I think people take that for granted, I try to not take people for granted as much in my life, because lately I learned how easily people can leave your life, I don't mean by death, no, nothing so dramatic as death, but through just living I guess, people will drift out of your life, sometimes they just disappear. I just assume when that happens it was something I did, for the beauty of being a masochist is that it is always some how my fault. This is not to say that I don't sometimes take people for granted, because we all do. But I try as much as I can to enjoy the simple moments with people. I think some people are meant to be in your life for forever like they are soul-mates and they are there to guide you and to teach you, as well you them. Some people are just there for a short period.  Sometimes I think I love people too much, which may sound odd from somebody who is always alone.  But It's very hard for me to let people in, for me to share myself, because even when I do let people in, I have to live with the overwhelming fear that they will leave me someday.  So there for it's easier to be alone, then to ever become attached, so I am with people usually enough to satisfy my need for people and companionship, but usually never long enough to have them become a part of me. Not until I really trust them.   But I do love people, and I love getting to know people, and first conversations, and first laughter, and the fist moment you find you have something in common, and the moment when you first disagree. When somebody opens up to you. The first time you go to a diner and talk about nothing for like three hours and smoke a pack and a half, and then you finally leave when the sun is coming up. And your cheeks hurt from laughing. And then to be lucky enough to keep those people in your life and to get to the part where the person really knows you, and knows when you are heart broken without you ever having to tell them. Or they knows when you are bull-shitting.  You get to the point in the friendship where you can finally shut up! The old friends will laugh with you, and at you, and about you when you aren't around. They will tell you how amazing you are, and how kind, how smart, how funny, and how happy you make them...Of course they will also tell you what an asshole you can be, and how retarded you are. I wouldn't want it any other way.   For all of my friends in my life, out of my life, or for whom ever will be in my future. I hope to share many little moments with you, I hope I take a piece of each of you with me as I grow, and hope to keep as many of you in my life. If you are no longer around me? Then I hope I took something good away from knowing you, that you gave me a story, and maybe, just maybe, if I'm really lucky I gave you something also. And for those still in my life, I thank you for many smiles, and lots of laughs, and hopefully many more years in my life. Unless I die, and then I hope you have a roast at my funeral...Thank you for being in my life...

       Full Moon   Last Night I went out to this bar called the Alphabet Lounge on like 7th and C...I saw a few of my friends I used to work with. We watched this sort of like rock/rap band that was cool. But the interesting part of the night came when I was walking to the subway to go back to Brooklyn. I had maybe walked a block before I ran into these three men outside that were talking about relationships, which is odd because I always thought men didn't really talk about that stuff, they ask me if I could offer a female point of view...I wanted to tell them that I'm not very female, nor can I offer any actual in site about relationships due to the fact that I've never had one I didn't some what manufacture, and make it real only to myself. Not to mention I'm fucking nuts. But I don't mention any of that.  So we sit outside for like an hour, total strangers, talking about relationships, and the ocean, I'm not sure how the ocean got involved, but it did, and it's a lot like relationships. So then I say my goodbyes and finally begin to walk to the subway, when out of the blue I here this "Stop", and I'm accosted by this man, who says "I just saw you walk by my bar as I was closing up, and I think you are the most beautiful women I've ever seen, can I please buy you one drink?" thank god for my low self-esteem otherwise I might get a big head about that, but my first thought is I think he needs new glasses. But I was still flattered non the less. So I say "I'm flattered, but I have to work in the morning (LIE)" He pleaded "One drink...I'll give you cab money to get home, just one drink?"  But I declined and thanked him again and then told him I would stop by his bar another time when I didn't have to work in the morning (LIE).  I'm sure he was a really nice kid, but he was shorter than I am, and I can't date short men. I'm an asshole, yes, but I can't.  But either way it was still really nice, I think it was the first time I've ever been chased down a street. Just sort of seemed like an odd end to a normal night. Much like the end of this blog..
