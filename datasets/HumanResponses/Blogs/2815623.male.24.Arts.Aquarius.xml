      When Peter Brissy bought the side of Turret Mountain some sixty years ago, he had pretty much his own choice of boundaries. And he had wanted his land to reach as far as the east slope because along that slope for a mile or more lay a cascading of stone. White, gleaming, jagged stone.  He could see as far as the stone and no further. So he had bought, and now his farm land, some clear and some forested, lay from the top most stone of the cascade to the pine darkened valley below.  Peter Brissy had been in his twenties then, made of the same material as the mountain, staunch and rugged.   First off he had mixed himself a mess of whitewash, then, stepping off his line, he washed a tree bole now and then. He began at the foot of the slope and worked along the bottom flat and up the west slope. When he had come to the summit of the cascade he set down his pail of whitewash and wiped his hands upon the seat of his pants.  Next Peter had taken his new ax, shiny, and keen as a hound dog for his breakfast, and he laid low a great many of the oak and pine, together with wild cherry and maple.  It had taken him nearly a year to build the road from the valley to where his house would stand; but it was a good road, with a stone base and stretches of log cleating.  Peter had driven his bride Selma, over the newly finished road in the light wagon to the big clearing.  Selma had cried because the road was so beautiful and Peter, big mountain lummox, had not understood her tears and so she had cried the harder. He had showed her, aside from the foundation of the big square house, the barn site and the spring, over which he would build the milk house. He had promised to make a heavy white trough to hold her milk crocks, neat and cold, in the spring water.  All this, Peter explained, would take him near another year and would she consider coming from her father's house in the valley and live in a one room cabin if he would be hasty and put one together.  Selma had considered that and so they had moved their belongings to the little shed-like place and set up housekeeping.  Selma's father had helped him make it snug and warm for winter and fitten for a woman to abide in. And she had cried again, this time over the cupboards built in the kitchen end, and over the poster bed stead Peter had turned upon his father's foot lathe, and again over the rich dark walnut stain he had made for the inside of the cabin.  But Peter was used to women's ways by now and her tears bothered him not at all. He had a new philosophy which was developed with his marriage and he reasoned that if God almighty had made women so crosswise that the cried when they were happy, then who was he, Peter Brissy, to question?  Things were as he had promised Selma and the house had been built and the barn, and in time, the wagon shed and milk house. The first winter Peter spent his spare time from feeding and clearing walks through the snow, in carving white wood butter bowls and a fancy mold in which Selma made out the little pats of yellow butter. He carved stirring spoons and a pin of maple wood with which to roll pie dough. He pegged together two maple crickets and waxed them with wax from the bees at his father's place. Winter evenings sometimes he and Selma would sit upon these low stools before their fire. Their faces would turn spotted from the heat and Selma would lay her skirts clear up to her knees, toasting her woolen covered legs.  And the evening which would seem late because of its early beginning, would pass. Together they slept. Patterns made by the low fire spread themselves out uncertainly here and there upon the low brown ceiling.  Years followed years like beads upon a rosary.  Close the end now, Peter might have looked backward thus: The year we moved into the shed house. The next year when we moved into the big house, and the next when James Benjamin, named for his grandfather Shelton, was born. The year the big west field was cleared, the next when Waite, the second son, was born.  Some years were... just years. Peter could not recall anything in particular, and then there was the year Carlotta was born.  And the year Carlotta had died. Her death, needless and shocking, had struck silver through Peter's hair and had broken her mother's heart.  Carlotta had been a bright dart of a child. That morning she had gone to the sow's pen with Peter and stood upon the bottom plank with her eyes which were the color of flax flowers, peering between the top planks, the while she had chattered in her gay little way.   Suddenly Carlotta's voice had stopped, and Peter, looking up from the slop he was pouring, had seen that her feet had slipped from the plank.  She had poked her head, with its starched blue sunbonnet, through the space between the fencing, and now she hung there helpless.  Peter's tongue had turned to stone as he released her limp form and his feet, too, had turned to stone as he neared the kitchen where Selma was busy with the breakfast dishes.  ........ It had thawed him a little to have Selma say she did not hold the accident against him.  That had been more than fifty years ago now, and Selma still kept the little sunbonnet laid away in the top drawer of the highboy. Always when Peter came across the bonnet he would remember the shocked look up Carlotta's face as she dangled from the fence boards. And it had taken Peter a long time to reconcile himself.   So he had grown old and no longer wanted to tussle with his steep flung acres of clearing, nor the tall wind bent timbers that hemmed them in. He split his farm, as he said, plumb in the middle sideways. He gave the bottom part to James Benjamin whose name had been shortened to JaBen. To Waite he deeded the upper place.  Waite and Elsie had lived with Peter and Selma and would always do so. They were childless and Elsie turned her thwarted womanhood upon her husband's mother and upon old Peter Brissy whom she spoiled shamefully and satisfyingly.   Peter had helped JaBen build himself a good house down on the valley road. After the building was done Pa helped the boys lay a fence of rails on the exact line that he, himself, stepped off.   When they had laid the fence as far as the road which ran from the valley bed to the homestead, they stopped and set a stout gatepost. Opposite this post, across the narrow road, the set another post then they left Pa with the building of a gate while JaBen and Waite continued around the mountain with the rails.  Pa had ordered paint from the mailorder catalog, a surprising bright blue paint, and had painted the gate.  Upon the topmost board he had lettered in white paint "Upper Brissy Place". The gate stood open as he lettered, then he swung it to and made lettering on the other side... "Lower Brissy Place."  With the drying of the paint there were two farms upon the fertile but stony unrelenting slope of Turret, where before there had been but one.

      Because the furrows were laid from east to west, the field looked, from the east end, where Waite stood leaning against his plow handle, a little like a partly opened fan. The late evening sun filled the long black furrows and gathered them together at the west end.   JaBen's boys had been following the plow for the last hour. They each carried a tin can into which they dropped fat, white grubs picked from the new-turned clods.  "Pa promised us we could go a-fishin' tomorry." They told Waite, and he kept a disapproving silence, thinking that JaBen was too easy with the boys, letting them idle around fishing when there was corn planting on hand. Waite and Elsie were child-less, and he did not understand nor hold with such slackness.  Directly the two big horses were loosed from the plow, and with reins slackened, Waite followed them into the barn-lot. Pa was there and he helped Waite with the feeding and rubbing down. Pa admitted he was too old to be a-following of the plow, but he would not relinquish the care of the barn and his share of the horses.   "Air we ready to start a-plantin' now, son?" Pa made to ask, from beneath the flank of big Dan.  "We air, Pa, and I don't ap-preciate JaBen a-lettin' the boys idle around fishin' tomorry." Waite's voice was tired and peevish. "I meant they should drop whilst JaBen and me covered."   "Tut now, I'll drop for you and Marcie can drop fer Ben." Pa was making peace for the boys, remembering how he had loved to fish and how it weren't the boys' fault that corn planting and fishing fell on the same day. What Waite didn't understand, Pa thought, humorously, was that fish that air a-rarin' to be caught just naturally got to be caught.   As Pa and Waite finishedj the barn work and went toward the house, they looked down upon JaBen's house where the blue smoke of the supper fire drifted up, up and away into nothing. Waitej wished mightily that he had a boy to scold over fishing. Maybe he'd scold only a little and let him go after all.  They went into the kitchen where their own supper waited....... and night came from somewhere back of the sunset, settling with a gentle wash of dark in the valley below Turret; ascending slowly until only the faint dark outline of the forest top showed where the mountain ended and the sky began.  ...............  Down at the lower place, JaBen sat with his feet in a foot-tub of water, warm and soothing to his feet, tired from the rough ground. He had rolled his overalls high upon his legs and given himself up to the comfort of the kitchen rocker. The while he soothed his feet, JaBen cultured his mind. He held upon his knees a copy of a book he had gotten from the mail-order house. The name of the book was "How to Speak Correct English."  Generally the Brissey men had been contented with what learning they could reasonably expect, but not so JaBen. In his own words, JaBen wanted to make something of hisself.  The light from the lamp fought back the darkness that entered at the open door and scarcely made enough light for him to read by, but he knew the pages so well now that a glance at the larger type was all he needed. For a year he had had the book and during that time he had struggled with his missing g's and his heritage of ain's. He had struggled with his having's, and with his alien weres. Before the inky newness had been worn from his book, JaBen had known it to be his romance, the answer to something that somehow he had missed in his youth.  Dimity indulged JaBen his whim for learning, but she would have none of it for herdelf. This evening she sat near the kitchen table, a bit of rug in her lap. ...  JaBen was tired and the hot foot bath made him sleepy. He nodded and the book closed itself upon his knees. Dimity brought him a coarse sacking towel and gently prodded him awake.   "Get yore feet outen there, JaBen, I declar' I'd rather clar up this mess myself than have you a-trampin' about the kitchen in yore bare feet and a-carryin' the dirt into the bed."  "You-all can just dry my feet whilst yore at it," JaBen said, teasing, and Dimity threw him a scornful look.  JaBen would go to bed now and maybe he'd lie a bit and dream about his raspberries. All day long he'd worked among them, and as he'd worked he had put two and two together and they had made exactly four. And he'd put four and four together and they had made exactly eight. His passion for raspberry growing had leaped within his exalted heart and he had hurried into the house to find Dimity. He had explained to her that a fortune could be made a-growing raspberries if only a fellow used good judgment in letting the old canes breed and bring up a mess of little ones. Just so many little ones, tho, the judgment coming in knowing when to take the grubbing hoe to them. He had explained how he'd only had twenty feet of canes last year and this year he'd dug the new growth and set twenty more. Last year's canes were white with blossom now, and he was certain Dimity would admire having the crop for jelly.   But JaBen's enthusiasm had cooled a little under the placid gaze of Dimity as she pointed out the fact that frost had laid low and blackened the strawberry patch two years and running and she was in no mood to set more plants to waste.......  JaBen was asleep the moment his head lay upon the pillow and he relaxed noisily upon the straw-filled tick that made his bed. Dreams of raspberries, tall silvery, rose-caned raspberries floated thru his head, along with dreams of the morrow, which was Saturday and the beginning of corn-planting.

      The pale Sabbath sun came through the stained glass window church on the Valley road. It came thru and struck at the hats of the women seated in the right hand pews and came no further than the aisle. Stopping there it made a kaledioscope of the faintly colored, faintly outlined reflection of the Christ on the window. Pa Brissy sat on the very end of the Brissy pew and regarded the reflection with appreciative eyes. The preacher's words thundered above him and around him, but he minded the words not at all. Pa had long ago acquired his own ideas of religion, and anything the preacher was saying probably only verified his own beliefs. Occasionally he looked toward the pulpit, however, nodding approval, and now and then he looked about the congregation with a manner of saying he'd told them so!  Mostly Pa studied the reflection upon the unpolished floor boards. He humored his imagination until he could make out the lamb, a little to the right of the lamb there was the staff and then the feet of Christ under His bright blue robe. Pa looked up at the window and smiled satisfiedly into Christ's eyes. The sun rose higher, the lamb on the floor grew more squat, the staff shortened, and only a little of the robe remained. But Christ's feet were plainer now, and Pa wondered how he could have walked so far in the frail and shallow sandals. He recalled reading how He had gone about in so many towns and upon mountains and thru valleys. Pa grew indignant, why, his own heavy boots would have been sorely put to it to have withstood the wear!  "Them things ain't no pertection to a man's feet," he scolded to ma in a whisper and she nodded and frowned in disapproval, not knowing whose feet he meant but reasoning that Pa was right.  Pa often fussed with God over trivial things and he meant to look up in the Scripture when he got home, and see for himself just how far Christ had made out to walk in those sandals, and he's kinda take God to task for allowing it.  Now the closing hymn was being sung and Pa rose stiffly to his feet, with Ma beside him, sharing a hymn book between them. The both scorned looking at the words for they knew every one of them, as they would have said, from their hearts. All the Brissys stood in their pew together. Next to Pa and ma stood JaBen and Dimity. Then came Waite and Elsie and JaBen's children, Benjy, eighteen, Marcia, who was two years younger, and last Thurlow, who was twelve.  After services there was handshaking and talk and inviting to dinner. There was exchanging of sympathies and much tongue-clucking over seemingly unheard of happenings. The men spoke of corn-planting and wheat and the favorableness of the weather. By now someone had bustled the preacher off to dinner. Those whose crops had been good the last years drove away in shiny new cars. Others less favored drove in cars of tall, thin, tin, and there were a few cars of heavy faded elegance, having an air about them of once having belonged to town folks.  The Brissy cars were of neither of these, but were a little lower than the tall tin ones, and a little higher than the new low ones, and a great deal lighter than the heavy elegant ones. Pa's car was square, and rusty black, with inside niceties, such as a bud vase where water had dried, and dried again. And it had big, fist-sized balls of silk cord nailed securely, which were used by Ma and Elsie to ease the bumps down the Valley road. JaBen's car was of the same goggle lighted vintage, but confined its inside splendor to ratty grey plush. The drove homeward now, as they did all other Sundays, Waite driving Pa's car ahead and JaBen following.   When they reached the farm road and JaBen's house, Waite stopped and asked which one was a-going up to have dinner as he did all the other Sundays, but JaBens', piling out at their own gate, returned the invitation which probably neither of the others heard. Anyway, Ma and Elsie had their dinner all ready at the upper place, as did Dimity at the lower......  April was deluged with rain, cold and chill, and the new leaves of the sycamore cupped upward like small umbrellas turned inside out, holding jewels of water upon their fuzzy sides. The pussy-willows, growing along the creek below JaBen's, poked out little gray heads along the brown winter branches, and stayed on with the cold and the wet. The kitchen gardens were flattened as tho the soil had never been stirred.   The Brissy's were used to fighting with nature, and so even tho spring did not come except on the calendars in the kitchens, the knew and accepted the season for what it was, and questioned not its lateness, nor its wanton stealing from the mountain's short summer.  Now May had come and gone, and June was about to be dumped into the Valley. There had been much trading back and forth at the two farms-- trading of boys for horses, JaBen having two of the former and none of the latter. Trading of seed corn and seed potatoes, and of Marcie to help Ma and Elsie, and of Elsie to help Dimity. And of tomato plants for cabbage. They forgot quickly that the spring had been long and tantalizing, beginning in March with cold bright days, and with winds high and ruthless, blowing night clouds about the evening sky and piling them upon the face of the white moon above Turret. Warm days had come to stay the season out, and warm like evenings, with frogs making great to-do in the creek. In Dimity's and Elsie's gardens, rows of lacy carrot and red-veined beet leaves came into being. White and yellow onion sets which had been washed top-side down, were straightened and covered again. Lettuce beds were re-made and fat white beans were put into the ground, to reappear amusingly, a few days later borne upon the wings of the bean sprouts.   They each had set their broody hens and dozens of yellow and black balls popped out from the breast feathers of their mothers. The balls, miraculously, had feet and tiny yellow bills attached...  From the kitchen window Dimity could see the sweet potato field. The ground had been ridged and today the men folks were setting the plants that had been raised in the big hot-bed at the upper place. Dimity could see the mens' backs as they humped along the ridges here and there, like rounded weathered stones that might have been left in the field and plowed about. Marcie and Thurlow were carrying water from the creek and pouring it into holes for the plants. Now and then Dimity caught a glimpse of Marcie's red cotton skirt, brown legs and bare feet beneath it. Later Marcie would come a-mincing across the yard, making out she had lady feet and that the grass was tickling her toes. Dimity would likely laugh at her and remark, "Yore feet air as tough as them pads on Thrasher's toes."  Then Marcie would dip from the sun warmed-rain barrel and wash her feet, a-sitting on the back steps..........  Late summer came and made a batik of the mountainside, dipping the fields into rich, deep dyes of the earth; making gold of the ripening wheat and silvering the pale green of the buckwheat, while the red clover became a rippling stream urged on by the hot winds. Later the clover fell beneath the clack! clack! of the mowing machine where it lay still upon the breast of the earth, curing to a terrible-like sweetness. The wheat bent on heavy heads and waited cutting.  The Brissey women canned the vegetables of the fields and gardens, greedily, for they knew the shortness of the summer and how frost sometimes nipped the corn and tomatoes even as they were hurried from the field. The yellow balls that had been the chicks were now domineck pullets, and white pullets, with here and there are quarrelsome rooster. Sometimes they stalked Dimity's garden, which was unfenced and open, and pecked the ripening tomatoes or craned thier necks and jumped to reach the ears of sweet corn. She or Marcie would come to the door of the kitchen and flounce their aprons toward the garden. The pullets would scurry into the barn-lot but nearly always a rooster would lag behind the others, throwing sassiness toward the kitchen door, poised to run unbravely should a stone or sun-burnt potato be hurled at him.    Few flowers grew in the short season on Turret, but in the farm-yards there were shurbs- lilac mock-orange and clovebush. Bulb flowers they grew, and chrysanthemums. Asters, given a good start in the sunny west window in the dining room, would bloom hurriedly in late summer, unfazed by the first light frosts. Ma Brissy cared not if she had not other than her chrysanthemums. Ma, with her shortening life, Ma was seventy-six, shortened her words accordingly. The chrysanthemums had long been 'santhemums, nor did they mind nor cease their blooming. The flung themselves against the west side of the house and along the white paling fence, and each fall burst into a veritable mess of brown little buttons and shaggy yellow heads. Ma thought she'd had some pink ones somewhere along the way, but nature had, unbeknownst to Ma, gathered the pink ones back into the yellows, gradually, so that even Ma who loved them, knew not whence the pink ones went. Now and then she dug into them, scolding that they were hogs, and sometimes she threw them head and tail over the fence where they were wont to turn reproachful yellow glances at her as she passed. Directly she as bound to notice that they had taken root and were growing in spite of her, remaining 'santhemums to the end of time.....    In the midst of the heavy cultivating Pa lost a horse. All evening Pa had noticed Big Dan and Job had been stamping their feet and snorting. Then he was awakened near midnight, thinking he'd best call Waite.     "Get up, son, I think they be trouble in the barn." Pa shook Waite. Going back to his room Pa dressed and with Waite, hurried to the barn.     "Hold that latern high, Pa." Waite called from the stalls.     "What air happened?" Excitedly.    "The thing that air happened air too bad to talk about." Pa, peering of the manger, saw poor Job lying upon the floor of his stall. Pa could never abide the sight of a horse, down, and now he spoke to Waite sharply.    "Wal, do something, don't stand there a-starin' at a helpless horse!"    "Now, Pa, don't be hasty. Big Dan has done kicked the gizzard outen Job, and there ain't no hurry." Waite was unruffled.    Pa brought his latern closer- Waite was right.    ..................    They buried poor Job the next morning, while the cultivating stood still. They'd dug him a hole in the soft earth of the west field. Pa declared, grumpily, to hide his feelings, that this was a tarnation bad time to lose a horse. Marcie stood by her grandpa and tearfully threw a few zinnias onto the filling earth. Then Pa scurried off to the barn and left Waite and JaBen to finish.    Pa wondered if Big Dan had had to pull more than his share of the plow yesterday. Maybe it wasn't just yesterday, but a lot of yesterdays piling upon each other until Big Dan's patience had burst in a mighty flash of iron-bound kicking. Possibly the racket he'd made infuriated him more and more. Possibly, too, he hadn't meant to kill old Job, only frighten him a little. But by then he had grown into a tall white fury, a plow horse no longer, too strong for a plow horse and only a little tamed.    Pa had stood away from Dan, but now he gave in, allowing Dan to nuzzle his hand a little.    "It ware right mean 'o you, Dan, and I reckon you know Ma and me can't scarcely buy no other horse right now, 'specially when we ware a-fixin' to help JaBen send Benjy to the Sannytarium at Far Mountain."    Pa thought Big Dan trembled, crying a little.

      "I wake up thinking about you, I go to sleep thinking about you, and the only time I don't think about you is when you're around."  coming to terms with obsession can be a tricky business. the first thing you have to realize, to understand, is that it is Never Going to End.  Ever.  you have to learn to live with your obsession, because one way or another, that is what you will be doing for the rest of your days. you can let that obsession control you, or you can learn to use it for your own devices. The obsessive impulse must be sublimated. some examples:  1) you wake up, thinking about the Crush. now, you have some options. laze in bed for two more hours, with picturesque frolics in fields of daisies dancing in your head, Crush and you, arm in arm, for eternity. Or, make use of the obsessive impulse - cook a breakfast worthy of Crush's divine tounge and tastebuds. use exotic seasonings. when you're eating your braised-egg and roasted red-pepper paté, you can be thinking of the fresh and invigorating shower your Crush would take afterward. then you can take that shower yourself. now instead of two hours of fantasy-land, you've had a productive morning, without ever once taking your mind off the irreplacable object.  2) say you've got to do a mundane task - getting gas, for instance. now, you're getting gas for Crush's car at his/her explicit request. "premium, please." but don't waste your money.  3) larger goals - if you could just become a better, faster typist (or dishwasher, or whatever), Crush would finally notice you, ask for your hand in holy matrimony, and baby-making would be the order of the day.  4) getting that shut eye. you know how Crush doesn't like to be kept up too late? also, Crush's exquisite sensitivity keeps him/her wide awake in the presense of anyone who's also awake. if you want to bed down with Crush, you'd better learn how to nod off at a moment's notice.  so we've seen that once you accept your own powerlessness in the face of obsession, you can turn it from a hinderance to a source of strength. like Barry Egan says,  "I have so much love in me; you have no idea how strong I am."   ...and how is the weather?

      just finished putting together a logo for my mom's wardrobe consultant business. today wasn't much of a day. woke up, went home, hand-rolled a cigarette, which took forever and kept threatening to fall apart; why did Carib leave me with so much poison? well, at least the neighbors like to come by and smoke. went grocery shopping, finally, and procured Amy's lentil soup (on sale), Mrs. Baird's bread and a large brick of cheese. i'm excited by the possibilities, although i haven't had a chance to delve into them yet. and i still have a dollar in my pocket.  i went (did you guys know went doesn't have an apostrophe?) up to the parents house and helped my dad with the fax project a little, and my mom with some mac stuff and her logo. still a few more steps before she can send out the announcement letter, but i'm happy that things are coming along.   damn, speaking of parents, how do they get so insane? the light in the living room just woke my mom up, and now she's stumbling around, shielding her eyes, saying "i don't want to wake up", and turning off all the lights in the house, 'cause they come in around the cracks in the door of her room  upstairs  and wake her up. so now i'm typing by monitor light. intimate monitor light.  so Claire thinks its funny to talk shit in my comments section. what she doesn't know is that i eat little Palo-Alto girls like her for lunch, all the time, without even thinking about it. i put 'em in my grilled cheese sandwiches, and it makes 'em cheesier. ba-boom!

      its raining pairs of giraffes and elephants right now at the Bouldin Creek Coffee Shop. I'm in my post-latte groove, and Evan and Mariah are here along with a host of others. Damn, my dad gave me $20 for driving cross town to deliver some documents, and I've already bought a latte, and I'm thinking about a Lone Star, and I haven't even sprung for TP yet. But the cloud-burst of zoo-animals has turned today into a carnival.   the other night I was singing Johnny Cash songs with the bums who live behind my apartment, and when we got to the part about the Tennesse stud being long and lean, it was a glorious chorus. took my signed petition by the office today, but didn't get paid. arghghgh! need ... 50 ... dollars.  oh well, I finished souping-up my website for the Incredibly Exciting Job Op last night and emailed it to them - only a meg. hopefully they will see that I know my way around html and interaction, and want to meet me. there's no telling how far this deal could take me if it works out.  the rain is slowing, and i'm thinking of 'desperados waiting for the train'.

      this album has taken the internet by storm, fueled both by its artistic validity and its controversial copyright nature. DJ Danger Mouse ripped off the Beatles'  White Album  and Jay-Z's  Black Album  both, making something doubly worth listening to. In an unsurprising move, all the record labels sued the hell out of DJ Danger Mouse and anyone who would sell or distribute the album. So of course, now the thing is all over the internet, and having d/led the album, i've got to agree that it's worth hearing.  If you're interested, know that this Tuesday is going to be an especially big day for mirroring the album, so it should be easy to find. Check boingboing.net.  Jay-Z's lyrics are better than I expected. I've always known he was a clever rhymer, but this album, or more accurately - the  Black Album , showcases his knack for genuine self-examination. "Moment of Clarity", over "Julia", shows him appreciating the hardships he's overcome. "December 4th", about his father's death, backed by "Mother Nature Boy", also gives a little back story on Jay-Z, in his mother's voice.   DJ Danger Mouse has created something both hard to listen to and compelling. As music reaches farther to the edges of genres, one has to be more versed in similar musics to appreciate what's in the sound.  The Grey Album  is stylistically out on the edge of remix music - but its familiar content allows even someone as naive to the ways of beat-cutting as me to get into the unfamiliar groove.  The Beatles sound improbable behind the crispy beats and J/Z's even crisper lyrics. Even with the  White Album  ingrained in my memory, some passages here are hard to identify. Without something like this interpretation of the two records, I may never have listened to Jay-Z seriously, and I bet the same is true for many people and the Beatles.  Conclusion: good stuff, also a perfect illustration of the way copyright law has fallen behind the creative culture it was designed to foster.

      "go to an extreme, come part way back" - brian eno, oblique strategies  the song:  Cremasta / You Make Me Worry  cremasta is the quintessential album track. quirky start, coupled with a catchier than thou body, this song embodies all the contradictions of at dusk, punk band and/or illuminated manuscript of the letter 'L'. what? well anyway, i think this is the song that becomes your favorite after you've had time to write the review. the sections:   intro  - cremaster  blend the sound of an explosion into the bells? old movie? "the charge of the light bridage" 	40 seconds in - classical guitar in the style of 'spanish caravan' mix notes - moutenate the bas(di) and guitar bell set up the drum mix, open all mics - natural tom - stick click just before change is the focus.     intro2 - johnny 5 	classical guitar sinks into the riff. moutenated guitar still rocking away, fills up more room.   A1 - suddenly organic interjection 	dry out the moutenator a little, and push the drum bus compression at tad 	aside from that, leave this section surprisingly unadorned. 	i think  making the album exactly like the rough here would not be a mistake.   w/ the exception of: cary's BV's throughout. how many distinct parts should be here? put a melody behind ooooh? something to make it sound like god. -continue this part writing in the next section.  B1 - g. love says "this is my room" marimba?  A2 - suddenly enhanced intersection mardi gras - party noisemakers / new years clacker, ribbon horns etc. the jangling of a thin string of bells, like a catholic priest, in the second half of this section. this is like a sound painting. make it float.  B2 - snare locks in not sure what to do here. something like b1, but maybe pizzicato violin in addition to marimba? will's rough vocals here are good also.  C - an essential vitamin symphony 	no chord left unturned maybe a Reid's Song orchestral section here, playing a piece which fills in the blanks. this could include marimba.

      today has been a day of iChatting. Erica, Cassie, Cary, Alison from the v-day party, Amy, Claire. like half my buddy list. and Claire dissed on me and went offline just cause i was talking to Alison, which is so like her. if you're reading this, Claire, you're in hott shit 'n shit. so beware. if i make it up to ptown on the 14th or whatever, i'll drink more than you, run faster than you, and beat your ass. Claire is unusually aggressive on the iChat, or maybe that's her Cali personality.  i think i'm gonna take a cue from Debbie and write blog entries that offend those dear to me. in that spirit, i say, Claire's a biatch, and if she reads this, i hope she Cries!  Cary and I talked overdubs, my website, travelling, the aborted fetus of my daa beach boys, and some newly written At Dusk songs. Unwater! hell yeah.   Erica and I talked all about college life and classes and hos. And Chunk 666.   and its getting on toward evening and my website is coming along, so we'll just see about what happens in the rest of the night. Anthony was threatening a party. i rearranged my room - err, rotated the bed. It makes me happier, but maybe it's not as good a bed for sharing. i'm all out of toilet paper. i'm trying to decide whether to go to the Blackhole (my parent's house) this evening. i know my mom needs help on her stuff, so it couldn't hurt.  damn, Peaches new album  fatherfucker  is radder on the whole than the first one. she rhymes menorah with labia majora.  speaking of music, i've got a review of the Grey Album i need to finish and post.

      i'm blogging offline right now - the internet window has become spotty. tonight partied, well, started when i woke up. how? well, it was a satisfying lift of spirits, and somehow the wave never seemed to cease. i sold a shirt to Elliott for $5, and bought condoms. just the essentials. then came the beer (just a little), and then later - more beer. random party. very strange, now that i think about it, but sort of par for the course for me.  at first it was lame when we arrived. there was no action. i mean, spam-fest! but Todd and his girl were there, and Jeff and Reese. we fucking killed that shit. first our crackheaded selves devised a plan to go up on this rAnDoM unlit stage just sitting in the backyard, covered in graffiti, and 'fan our crotches', so me, Todd, Jeff and Elizabeth are up there doing synchronized squat and fan-your-crotches. and then this other cracked-out motherfucker comes up and starts yelling, "Blarghghg!!" over and over again, and it catches on. next thing I know, I've got a lawn chair on my head and i'm saying 'beep ... beep' and this totally socially acceptable, unremarked upon, even. the dadaist lethargic punk portion of the evening was concluded by a group chair kicking. there was a sad little rolling office chair in the room with the Mr. Bungle, so we all started kicking it gently, and knocking it over occasionally.   and saying 'blargh' rather calmly. which is funny, 'cause that was not the first time the word came up tonight. somehow Jeff sang a song composed of only blarghs at the spider house show, earlier @ around 6 o'clock, which has become a circus, if you count the show Lauren made of touching her tongue to her nose onstage, and Elloitt's demonstration of independently wiggleable ears.  so back to the party. after the chair kicking, we took to undermining the fabric of music using only our bare hands and rudimentary instruments. i banged on this and that and we sung about how "i'd eat beef-jerky from your asshole, cause you're so goddamned fine." err, that was Jeff's line. and other campfire songs. but this was no campfire, it was someone (Andy? Scott? Gilbert?) 's house. it's rare that i find such a twiggledy time - they actually appreciated my 5 string guitar playing, while trumpet blared, barney piano plinked, and violin veered off key.   now i'm home and i have a new proto-song, 'nancy & lee' or 'the animal'. i am upset but unsurprised that the first time i sung the song, when it was perfect, it failed to record. i thought it was but it wasn't, but how would you know which the perfect takes were if they didn't getaway?

      the song in my head: "it's a wonderful life" by Black Box Recorder. other favorites of mine from them are "british racing green" and "weekend".  today has treated me well. finished up the first leg of my signature gathering process; got a response from my Incredibly Exciting Job Opportunity - they want a sample of my work. so i intend to spend the weekend cooking up something that cannot be denied. perhaps a webpage for the music promotion outfit i should have started a long time ago.  am rocking to the dance-a-litious sounds of Sweetchild. now where did i put my jiggle?

      since our last meeting, i've had taco bell drive through (thank the lord above for change under the seat!), visited grandma, and done some satisfying cloak and dagger work on the fax project.   watched  Duel of the Iron Fist  last night. seems that Q.T. replicated the resteraunt from Kill Bill exactly from this movie. i think the blood splatter effects were painted onto the film with red dye. back to my iced T.

      i experienced an intersting sort of nostalgia today. as i was driving south down guadalupe, i spyed a man eating a burger in his car. i immediatly became nostalgiac for the time when i could have fast food when i wanted it, without having to worry about budget. then, later on, the radio started playing tejano music, and i listened to it for the rest of the drive, thinking about la parrilla.

      I finished recording "Jennytalk (Science Bear Arcade)" today, soon you'll have the ability to listen to it. Thus far, I haven't found an ftp server for it, 'cause I think someone down at Spiretech realized the Alleycat site was eating up a lot of space, deleted a couple of files, and changed the password. hrummph.  Hopefully Greg'll get M4DZ back up so ya'll can here this new song about my whereabouts. Time to go down to the Alamo for the free Wednesday movie. Just ate a steak and baked potato of gargantuan proportions, courtesy of mom.  Derrida seems mostly to talk about himself. Keeping the legend alive.

      it must be christmas in the hotel reno! suddenly, my world of half-remembered sadness turned into a full-fledged world of woo hoo! the culprit: my wireless connection is mysteriously available again. to celebrate i took my last dollar down to the coffee shop and paid for a cup of coffee.  today was my first day on the job as a signature gatherer for the firefighter's union. i get paid 50¢ a pop to talk to cute UT students and today was beautiful, so it was a good time to be studying on the lawn, in picturesque knots of 3 or 4. many of which are registered to vote, right here in austin. i only got about 25 signatures, but i learned that it can be done, and tomorrow i'm gonna start much earlier, and get more done.  my sinus infection is still a fucking disability, i can't stray too far from home, or else i run out of tissues in my pocket to blow my disgusting effluence on. really, overall my mood today has been blah. grumpy from brokeness/unemployment, sad to hear about amy's various hardships, sick of living in a pigsty. but i've been making progress on most fronts today (even the apartment is getting cleaner), and i've got a whole series of job applications to send out.  -my smoke alarm beeps about once every 5 minutes-  the problem is, i think the job for me doesn't exist. not in a final, lost cause sort of way, but more like in a, there's an organization that i could be working for, that would benefit from my being there, but A) i don't know about them, B) they don't know about me, C) and consequently, they are not making their presence known to me. i need to figure out how to canvass possible employers, without relying on the classified ads. i do think this latest step in my job search is inspired by the REALLY AWESOME JOB i applied for yesterday. the inspiration being that if i worked for this company, i would be doing something i could consider career oriented, rather than say, BBQ oriented. so now i think career, and its wierd to me because i never said to myself "Austin, it's the place for me." and now i'm starting to feel more rooted, or maybe it's just habit, but whatever, i've lost my complete block on applying for jobs that i would feel bad quitting at a moment's notice.  strange becuase the first legal proceedings for the fax project are tomorrow, at which we stand to make some serious money. i guess that might be the best job for me overall, if it works out.   the keyboard player from saturday night hasn't called me yet, but i guess that's to be expected, seeing as how i didn't give her my number. ought i be thinking things like this when i'm in a relationship as i am? mariah knows i'm a one man guy, and i think she knows how much i appreciate her, so i guess it's all right.  so this blog thing is still a little strange to me. i guess i'm mostly writing it for myself. if i wanted a lot of traffic i'd have mostly links to saavy websites and hot topic news stories. how bout another shout out for human cloning? human cloning, yeah! i suppose doing this blog saves me the embarassment of writing long, meditative letters to people who don't share my passion for long, meditative letters. i guess i should get back to cleaning the pigsty.

      i'm just sitting here installing OSX on my momma's computer, type typing the time away. last night jack and jeff's show went well, despite the lack of a PA. i feel like these guys are going through the ringer, what with the cold weather, no PA, etc. but that they will be so ready to rock when the weather gets nice and the crowd starts to grow. so if you are in Austin, and it is a nice saturday, come down to the spiderhouse around 6.  last night I hung out with Reese, who'd been in Huntsville for a few years, he seems to have come out all right, although he never should have been put in there in the first place. after Jeff's show a bunch of us went out party crashing and ended up at this little house in my neighborhood where real live hipsters were having a real live hipster music show, complete with Juno 6's and iBooks, girl keyboardists and granny glasses. i fell in love with one little dancing fairy girl, improbably short and bubbly, and with the keyboardist of the second band. yeah! the first band i heard is like, big drums and loud guitar stuff. i wanna put some mics up and hear them go boom! so i handed my card to the gay boy singer, who put it in his mouth. sexy.   the pundits are praising kerry on tv for "looking like he could play POTUS." har. that's exactly what i want in a president.

      i had a very full day yesterday. in (no) particular order:   woke up, checked email (this is me in my PJs in the coffee shop, just to use the internet. i'm hoping they get the picture and move the antennae so it reaches my apartment again.) showered. went to Ruby's BBQ to inquire about my application, met the friendly manager lady, who was very busy, although the place was mostly quiet. i hope i didn't pull the resented-forever-for-coming-into-the-busy-restaurant applicant dude thing. hopefully the cute girl i always talk to will put in a good word for me.  then Jeff came along and bought me a Gyro. yum. and then chess and trying to fix his guitar and visiting 5 (five) music stores to rent pianos and get a part for his guitar, and no one has what he wants (yamaha S90) and no one has any kind of decent preamp/compressor channel strip either. one store had a decent collection of mics but who am i kidding anyway?  from music shopping then we stopped by Boulden Creek Coffeeshop to visit Mariah and freeze our asses off and breath fumes from the broken heater. and play chess. my play has gotten to be so aggressive that most of the time when i checkmate i'm down material. living on a prayer. this time, though, it was agreed a draw.  and back to the Hotel Reno to fix Jeff's guitar with the newly acquired electro-magical pluggerator. which it turns out don't work in any of the possible soldering configurations, because the original broken plug differs in some invisible to the naked eye way from the one we bought. i can probably fix Jeff's guitar, given enough elbow grease (and a different part), but working on it for like 3 hours was enough. i need a workbench and a multimeter (with continuity tester).  while i was attempting this unholy frankenstein operation, i had a visit from Carib, who sat drawing in his sketch pad while i blasted Nine Inch Nails and soldered.   so then eventually Mariah and I left a drunk on a 40oz Jeff to strum his guitar in search of seltzer water; after giving up at the Chevron, we went to the spiderhouse (ain't no driving on those frozen roads) where the unneighborly troll (er, um, friendly coffeeshop employee) proceeded to charge a bunch of money for not much seltzer water. i stomp him. but i have to get along with him because i need his help for putting out the PA for the shows on saturdays. glug blug slug.  so we say down outside so M could smoke her cigarette, and i went and got my computer, and eventually we realized that since we she'd finished smoking, we could go inside and check email in the warm. which we did and that was good. so eventually Mariah went back upstairs to hang with Jeff, and I kept internetting until...  chirp chirp chirp (my phone sounds like crickets) its ringing and i'm not sure what to do cause the line says (PRIVATE) which is like not what it usually says when it rings but I answer and its...  McCligglty! so i folded up my computer and went outside where we talked for 49 minutes. so digital. heard about her job and surfing and that she's hanging out with Ayelet and Lindsey and Van and Julia S. and her boyf. doesn't sound like a bad crowd for a Claire, not at all. and the surfing, which is her new life, surfing all the time when she is not at work. and talking to Claire made me feel like my own life right now is just a series of random events - unfocussed, as it were - because Claire always seems to know what she wants to do and does it. and she said she'd like to visit and we talked about how cool it would be if we went to film school together, but then i had an even better idea where she goes to UT RTF and i continue to be a slacker. and i would like to visit Claire in paradise also but i turns out we might be in Portland at the same time cause she's going up about when I'd maybe be up there for At Duskin'.   so she's gotta go and i gotta go so i go back up to the apartment, where Jeff is using his new-found power of playing by ear to do everything from "Man in the Moon" to "You Give Love A Bad Name" on the acoustic guitar, and Mariah is studying the tutorials on Chessmaster, no doubt so she can kick my ass (which she almost did later). and then I eat 3 more peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and Jeff decides to go home, so it's like 3 am and Jeff goes out the door and turns around and says "woah, there's snow on the porch" which if you remember was from the other day was something i thought myself but this time its not just a little snow, so we starting packing the stuff up into tight balls and throwing it a Shawn's window, till Anthony comes out and next thing you know it's a  HUGE EPIC SNOWBALL FIGHT! and people are getting smacked and frozen and I took the pacifist route and decided to build a snowman, but once i got a snowman sized snowball i threw it off the balcony at jeff who didn't see it coming and boom, a snowball in the face. ha ha! he got a couple of satisfying shots at me but never did anyone come close to Chris' flying snowman.  so eventually Jeff pulled away in his vehicle and Mariah and I walked down to Kerby Lane Cafe, taking winter-wonderland pictures the whole way with my digi-cam. when we got to Kerby, it was packed as packed can be, with fudge-packers and fratboys and people in evening-wear (at like 4am), but we were seated quickly and the hot chocolate was perfect. the waitress even read my mind about wanting a cup of water. as in it just showed up when i started thinking "i'd like a cup of water". so we tipped her big, and walked home through the winter wonderland and slept till 2:30.  so now you know what it's like for a day in the life of me.

      i learned something new about myself today: it takes me much longer than you might suppose to formulate the thought  woah, there's snow on my porch . cause there is, and i didn't believe it at first, and then, it wasn't the kind of thought i have ready access to, cause those snow neurons are not well exercized. like an eskimo trying to talk about html.  so yesterday  Pure Digital Silence , which is what I call my new album, made it to the label's address. which reminds me to email the artwork before my battery dies... done and done. so yeah, last night my parents sat through the whole album and praised and praised most every track. that's nice, but i already know this stuff is the shit, now i'm just trying to figure out how to take it to the next level.  i'm working on a new song called either "the Science Bear Arcade" or "Jennytalk", and last night the homeless people were singing in the back alley, so i recorded them for this track. i don't know if i'll use it all, but in any case i gave the singing guy about a dollar in change as i was going out, which is more than Ringo got paid for the first Beatles sessions. a Science Bear Arcade is like a cross between a hippy market and a zine, all old Atari games and glittery "Terrorist" t-shirts. I gave the folks down at the SBA a stack of Reed Band Comps and told them to go crazy with em. $2. all the proceeds go to ?  saw that the city of San Francisco started marrying gay people on Wednesday. good for them. i think that the legality of same sex marriage should be as much if not more obvious than that of human cloning. which, as you all know, i think is the shit. clone me, clone you, woo hoo! go human cloning. organ farms! baby steak! sugar and spice and everything twice.  isaac and jack just walked into the coffee shop wearing blankets and viking hats. i think that means it's morning. perhaps today will be a day of absurdity. it sounds like the cure is singing "sweet child o'mine" over the stereo. there's  snow  on my porch. rapidly melting, but snow nonetheless.   voltron

      woke up today at like 2:45 and still had time to go beg for jobs. i showered and put on my "remember me" hat - pointy hand-woven by Anova, with long tassles hanging off the ears, and my not too professional, but still respectful outfit - consisting of blue collar shirt, jeans and a Reed hoodie. i went to Kerby Lane cafe, Urban Outfitters, and Ruby's BBQ. Ruby's is now my main lead, I'll be going back there tomorrow.   Part of me wants a job that challenges me and makes use of my talents and my Degree, but also i don't want to make commitments to something like that unless i intend to follow through with them. and right now i'm looking at any job i get as a short-term thing. i don't know how much longer i'll hang out in austin - depends in part on how much cultural capitol i can gain from the Spiderhouse connection. i want to start a weekly music video night, and Jeff's got a somewhat weekly gig here on Saturday evenings now. the main thing keeping me from throwing on more events, now that I have the implicit blessing of the owner, is money to make photocopies of flyers. hence the job search.  i have a feeling things are gonna change much when the weather gets nicer. this place will be more popular, i'll be a little more established, and hopefully i'll get a chance to make records. speaking of, another variable in my employment plans is my portland trip sometime in the next couple of months to finish the at dusk record. so much to do, so little time.  i've come up with an idea for an album of non-music. i want to record only the sounds of wood. chess being played, log on log, maybe my classical guitar as bass some more. ok, its starting to sound more like music. but sound, sound is what i'm interested in.  my nose is dripping so i must return to my coffin.

      as i was looking at this blog, i noticed something good:  http://www.bookblog.net/gender/genie.php  well, if you ever want to know how masucline or feminine your writing is, now this is ever the place. some researchers in Israel came up with this algorithm that rates your text based on its word content. the tougher words, for instance, as you now know, "some" are in the male column, while She-Ra words, such as the word that describes how we feel about Ike are in the column in which they belong. good thing, this.  ---  so gender genie thinks i'm a him: female score on my above paragraph = zero, but since i'm male, actually my 'him' score came out more like 664. because i looked at a graph, and wrote like a him, since everything i said was "male", so i scored so high, like too high. more so than actually. because like actually anyone can write like a him or a her. what i'm writing here has a score of 1349 female, male 0. so there.  ---  the most feminine word is "him", and don't you forget it, ladies.

       song: banana split/gone too far:   of all the songs on the table, i think this one is the least in need of the kind of overdubs that actually change the nature of what is going on in it. most of what i have to propose is just aimed at making what is already there be  more there.  if there's anything about this song that could be considered a weakness, it's that the front chorus and the back chorus are mostly indistinguishable as they stand. that edit - shortening the front chorus... could be a solution, but i'm leaning more and more to leaving it stand as is. (treating this song as a radio song ain't a bad idea, which is what makes me want to distinguish the choruses.)  probably the best way to think about this song and what we can do to add to it, is dynamics, and so most of my ideas are more like mixing than tracking stuff, but knowing what the direction is will help to guide any overdubs.  basically what we've got is big chorus and medium verse. anything we can do to make the chorus seem bigger without really diminishing the verse is good. also, as to the aforementioned concern, making the second chorus bigger than the first is part of a solution.   intro:  solo drums start out rocking - when the band comes in it shouldn't make the overall mix louder. having the main guitar track quiet and panned center will give more room for things to grow later, plus these lyrics are good so showcasing them in verse one is good.  and we won't forget to overdub the sound of a garbage truck crashing into a cement mixer, turned backwards, and echoed in a cathedral, all culminating exactly when Cary's guitar comes in.   verse 1:  the vocals, as i've said in various communiques, should sound even more authoritarian here, maybe even straying into strokes territory - i have some ideas about how to do this that won't be so strained. the idea is to sound like  big brother , so maybe something like a harmonica mic (which i think ed has), and then running that sound through the radio speakers at chateu de dusk for echo, with a well placed room mic (maybe basement). other than that, i think this verse can stand as it does.   stars 1:  dynamically, this section should be a subtle decresendo before the chorus, to make the chorus seem even bigger. this decrecendo is the key to making the chorus seem so much bigger than the verse, without shrinking the verse. i think the reverb on the guitar is our friend here. i would suggest another, slower reverb guitar lead here, maybe played twice for the sake of stereo. what i hear is something that occurs  rhythmically concommitant  with the last two words of each line, eg "your eyes" "good byes", etc. but this is your song. maybe distance miced with the c1000. also, maybe clarinet or flute or oboe might be good here... cello? so many possibilities. those last few instruments i think of more as being in 'angel' but as long as you are convening players...  vocals - double last two lines "i can count on the stars" in unison, this is a harbinger of the big thick ass vocal that happens in the chorus...  in mixing we can also fade down the guitars during the part, and then bring them back up for  chorus1: mainly, just what we've got but bigger. three or four more tracks of guitar. another complementing the rickenbacker sound, for the sake of stereo. these two together will make up the bulk of the sound (maybe with the 690 aimed near the edge of the cone? -helps dull the sound a little, or maybe borrow amy's new mic - the 57 or the other one.).   then two guitars, maybe recorded with the oktava -don't want them to be too bright. these two  split the main chorus riff in half . so theres the high strings part (happens with the snare), and the low strings part, on the other half of the riff. well, put those on two seperate tracks. not sure what guitar to use, maybe the jazzmaster. these i imagine as subtly enhancing the sound, giving it a sort of back and forth feel in the stereo image. -remember, before the chorus, the deviation from mono, except for the drums, has been minimal. now the sound has got to more than fill out.  fourth - CRUNK NAST! this guitar is the sound you've always hated. think of the band practice room, think of  warm PBR while you have sand in your shoes and bird just pooped on you.  now think of what you want to do to that bird. do it to a speaker cone. then record it probably with the d112. this is just to put low low in the mix and give it some crunk nast.  oh yeah, an  absurd amount of vocal harmonies  for the whole chorus. we can go back and not use them or mix them low, but the vocals here have to compete with will's big brother verse vocals without being distorteda.  verse 2: this is a chance to introduce just a little of the rhythmic and harmonic dissonance i will council you to unleash in the second chorus. maybe something like crunk nast playing a lead part that  subtly undermines the overall stability  of the song. this song starts solid and stable, and stays that way while rocking the whole way through. the only way to push past that, is to blow it over the edge. i'm actually not sure at all what to do here. i imagine the main guitar will be up in the mix compared to verse one, but other than that, i think mostly mono, as in verse 1, is the way to keep this. but it does need some sort of decoration... maybe some vocal harmonies (angry loud doubling of every second line?) or maybe some lead like i mentioned (think of the lead toward the end of RUalone), or who knows. do some things you don't think you'll use, and who knows, maybe you'll like them later. (another thing that comes to mind is the dissonant slide guitar monster that haunts the Deep End.)  stars 2: lets keep this much like the first stars section, but maybe do harmonies a lot like the "sound of expanse" section of WMHBTS. decending at the same time as ascending... the time around people should be expecting the chorus, and doing something like that will only increase the expectation of something dynamically big to happen next.  but no   TFA: everything goes mono and low fi-ish here. its like the opposite of what happens at 2:30 in Death Cab's "We Looked Like Giants". or something like Bright Eyes. if we could get this section to sound like tilted floors, but more, that would be great.  grainy = good . this is just a mixing thing... no overdubs necessary. because the sound is so miniscule here, the chorus can then be even huger. i mean, if you guys have overdub ideas, definately do them, perhaps the right part could really get this section to shrink even more. like a fist! oi!  chorus 2: all the guitars from chorus 1, but played with a little more  reckless abandon . maybe alter the chords or hit the  wammy  bar or something, but make it feel like  the floor is about to drop out from under you - cause it is.  also, maybe some more of the lead like i suggested for verse two. just tear the roof. off. cause this is the end part of the current single. phil spector knows about end parts of singles. maybe a  harmonica  playing slow chords in here would be nice. think springsteens tunnel of love. crazy fade outs he's got. but this aint no fade. and i think having it end tight with the vocal like it does now is also good... abrupt and clean.  vocally... maybe bring will in here also, not sure. i think vocals are something we can really think about after overdubs are mostly done. (on all these songs)   ooohghg, another thing that just came back to me, is i had thought of a horn section, like on the rolling stones 'bitch', but that might be too much. listen to bitch, and think about it and the practicalities of doing it. i hear this on the verses... but who knows where. maybe just on the last chorus... perhaps - and this is i think the best way to do something like this, is to bring horns in on verse 2. or no horns at all, or, something completely different.   africa addendum:  more for [glock]: double "so good to have you back" and "we still have not changed the locks" when they happen, cause that melody would sound perfect on glock.  until next time, may the force be with you, Chris

      ok, so i'm officially a concert promoter now. I introduced Jeff and Jack to the crowd, hung _a_ flyer, and now i'm sitting listening to the music and leading the clappers. i organized this show earlier in the week, and then almost couldn't pull myself together to put it on today. the low level sinus infection i've been fighting all week sure does put a damper on my energy level.   earlier today I went down to 29th and Lamar and waved at cars for an hour. When your holding a Dean sign, about half the people honk and wave, and of the remaining half, most don't notice you, although some look very nervous about your presence - I think i confused those people - the average brain fart induced in drivers by Dean supporters is probably something like, "ummmm, Kerry?"  a couple of outliers: one monarchist yelled "Long Live Bush" and one girl in a silver car hollered, "I love Clinton!"  So now the temperature is dropping, but the attendence is holding steady. After Jack gets done, we'll see if people stay around to see Jeff. I've got to MC between acts; I hearby summon the powers of humor to get me through. Ha ha ha.

      things i could be doing right now instead of tinkering with RSS feeds and commenting scripts and other stuff: watching a chess video with Jeff, drinking heavily by myself, returning to the strip club with Debbie and a whole gang of lesbians, making that song with the 'bm ch' stuff, addressing my letter to Claire, and that's just off the top of my head. i have made a lot of progress, but still, i wish i could get the thing to load up in NetNewsWire. if anyone has any hints, email me.  i had mom's meatloaf tonight, quite fancy, with lamb, veal, and beef. take that, Lisa and Dweezil!   as god is my witness, I will return to the Hotel Reno tonight.

      I've been obsessively tweaking the template settings on my blob for a few days now, i think it's time to rest. the upshot: pistachio background (my mom says its all the rage for spring '04), micromanaged bylines, and nothing's yet been done about the monkey business up top. still in my mind, the happiness i deserve won't be available until I get commenting working, that and the rest of my website up so you (my vast readership) can join in the effort i've only begun, to embarass me publicly, and at the same time download and listen to the 'music' I've created.  I have a new idea for a song. the drums go 'bm bm, bm ch ch', and that's all i've got so far, but soon you will get to listen to it. I'm also getting so durn near completing my solo album that i have already addressed a padded envelope to Greg at mfdz.com, so that when i EVER get back to my apartment (i've been away for 3 days now) i can burn and mail a CD! woo hoo! now what am i ever going to do about that pesky Fast Car song?

      visions of secretaries clad in tweed dance in my head as i blog here from Joy of Austin. the decor is checkers and neon, the girls are looking (for tips), and the drinks are thankfully stiff. probably not the only stiff thing around here.   i came up to visit Mariah, and we've been chatting on and off, as she balances her drink tray in one hand, and a cigarette in the other. Billy Idol is singing"More! More! More!" and I'm trying to decide the best use of the $3 left in my pocket. I've never tipped a stripper just a dollar before, so I think that is on the menu. Always good to explore outside your comfort zone.  JCA, signing off.

      this initiates a series of meditations on the nature of AtDusk's new songs, as we have recorded the basic tracks, and are moving on to the next phase of the project. every so often I will post one of these meditations, and they will be meaningless for anyone unfamiliar with "The Blizzard of Forgotten Hope".  ---  well here's the first installment of chris' this is what i think should happen with songs i didn't write newsletter. i think in general, we should do all the overdubs time, hard-drive space, and imagination allow for. myself, i bought a 200Gb firewire drive today for $200, so... if you don't want to hear me grasp at straws that broke the camel's back, you can probably skip the plot synopsis and move right on to the cast of characters. if you guys envision the song entirely differently from me, we may end up with a quite eclectic set of overdub ideas, which could make mixing interesting. just as long as we have the discipline to use only what we need when the time comes.  the song:  africa/northern renaissance   after getting to know this song, it is easy to see how you guys are so excited about it. it was the first of the bunch to arouse my curiosity, as it is so different with vocals than without. even so, most of my overdub ideas are in the realm of guitar and glockenspiel, rather than in vocal harmonies or wind instruments.  plot synopsis: one thing about this song, is that while is has a lot of powerful playing on it, the arrangement structure is mostly symmetrical, centered around the break. the objectives of any decoration/overdubs we might do, i think are two-fold. first, to frame the two (in my mind) most important sections of the song, the northern renaissance section ( the bottom #2 ) and the  africa  section. the metaphor of frame comes to mind, i think because those sections are where the action is (as it were) and that the rest of the song already serves to support them, so why not enhance what we've got. second, the symmetry i'm talking about serves (in its current incarnation) to make the overall form of the song static. anything we can do to add a sense of momentum and progress (hither or thither) with way-stations at the  bottom #2  and  africa , won't be groping in the wrong direction. 	right now it's a song about going somewhere, i mean coming back,  eg. a journey , but the basic tracks musically focus on the returning aspect, and less on the journey. so, to make this song into a journey which also frames its most active aspects, i propose the following overdubs.  cast of characters: glockenspiel aka glock - not to be confused with the handgun rickenbacker aka rick - but not too slick el flango - popularized by 95.5 and pharrell williams the shaker  capoeira  - new since the last time we talked.   [glock] intro. the first sound heard is the glock. here as a harbinger to the madness that is to follow. perhaps three eighth notes, the last one landing on the first note of guitar. very sparse glockenspiel continues until [enter vocals].   then no glock until the  chili peppa  section, where it serves to create the BUILD that precipitates the break. i'm not sure how, but i think a few tracks of glockenspiel, each proceeding from spacey sparseness to  frenetic fury , and then temporally unifying for the 4 chord drop out from the break, would really take the stable symmetry and make it teeter like a top, as well as lending cleanliness to the break.  -brainstorm: a couple of tracks of sustain-pedaled piano playing what could be glockenspiel parts might add some balls to [glock]. this is something you guys could easily play yourselves.  [rick] doubles greg's guitar part on:  the bottom  everytime it comes around the short  africa rock  after the break and starting in the last  bottom  through  rasta weeze #2  and the coda, maybe not exact doubling, but getting crazy with everything else as the song ends. big bends? maybe do a couple of tracks of rick, one miced from across the room with the C1.  [el flango] present only in the  bottom #2  and the coda, el flango is a long note value slide guitar part run through a deep, slow, wooshy flanger, maybe from a gainy guitar, and then softened somehow, most likely by amp settings (high gain, with low output volume)? i dunno... use you ears, listen to the vocal effect on pharrell's 'frontin' causes that's the  rosetta stone  for this effect, better yet, but maybe harder to download, is the vocals on 'run to the sun' from his N.E.R.D. album. i can iChat either of them to you.  if not slide guitar, at least legato, and super-simplify for the words 'northern renaissance'. the point of this part is to make this section especially memorable, and stir things up a bit on the way into the  chili peppa  section. it seems to me like a good exit strategy is to slide out with the bass on the first run of  rasta weeze .  this part's closest relative is the bass, and so in the coda it should serve to empahsize the bass, which for most of this song hangs in background. maybe straight doubling in the coda...  [the shaker] doubles the hi-hat part in  africa .  as the only overdub present in  africa  proper, like a fly in a crowded theater, it serves to anoint the silence, while at the same time drawing attention to the steady pulse lurking behind everything-crazy-else.  a note on [the vocals] i think the hint of harmonies just after the break are a good start. this section of africa rock could not have too many vocal harmonies.  blow it up.  after the relative chaos leading up to the break, some harmonic richness here will serve as a landing pad for energy released by the break. also, i'm a firm supporter of Greg's idea of dropping Will's vocals for the first couple of reps of 'the time before' part. i'd also like to hear some unison doubling here with Cary and Will, as well as both some screams and some quiet singing from Will.  [capoeira] an option for the  africa  section: some dense percussiony stuff, to make it sound  'ethnic' . shoot me. and don't forget the castanets, better yet, put copious castanets on every song - i think we've learned our lesson here.

      It's my birthday and Jeff and Mariah are here. We're expecting my parents to return, as well as the company of my grandmother and Hayden. BBQ is on the menu; we've high hopes for a Mad Cow infection and/or the appearence of Isaac. Talked to the X today, got "Happy Birthday" from Cyrus, Berit, and Amy, and had a random call from Panika in Alaska in the morning. We're running low on snack crackers. Quick, get the boat!

      Tell me, have you seen a movie so bold, so crisp, so meticulous in nature as STUVIE? My dear friend Claire has constructed a masterpiece of mockumentary memoir, rivaled in ingenuity and originality by only the best films of Franco and Fellini.   STUVIE takes us into the real lives of five housemates, who live in a Portland tenement rented from an orangutarian loafer, named Stu. While these innocent housemates try to carrying on about their lives, an incessant camera-woman documents their every move, uncovering the secret identity of Stu the Landlord!  Through the housemates' own eyes, we see Stu eat human feces, consecrate the memory of his grandmother, trespass, prevaricate, and much, much wacky more. STUVIE is the debut film from Booty Call Productions, and with an auteur like Claire at the helm, the world turns to see what comes next.

      i was hit by a truck today, while driving my godfather's car back from Camel's Hole. isaac and i had just left julie's house, were stuck in traffic on guadalupe, and were hit from behind by an apologetic man who gave me all his insurance etc, my car then slammed into the car ahead of mine, but no one was really hurt. i'll have isaac check my pupils again in a minute, although he'd probably be delighted to see my coma.  i've been cooking all evening, but nothing matches the smell i sense coming from taco bell and ruby's bbq. i spent my last $8 on onions, garlic, soy milk, etc. i also wrote up a few recipes with fanciful names:    sunrise tapas  cook down corn, black beans, and tomato soup until thick. let sit. scramble with equal part eggs and a dash of pickapeppa sauce. serve on crisped tortillas, with sunflower sprouts and the aforementioned sauce.   walter sandwich  peanut butter, deep fried egg, and sausage on toast. (i had this tonight.)   wendy sandwich  tomato, goat cheese, scrambled egg, and basil sausage on heavy toast.   yummy pasta  broiled garlic, broccoli, and green unions, served over any kind of pasta. with romano cheese.   real pancakes  thick and fluffy with poached eggs.   pancake scramble  any combination of onions, garlic, peppers, curried rice, eggs, tofu, scrambled with pancake mix in canola oil.    i wrote that up to tide myself over between meals. i've cooked everything on that list, except for the wendy, usually from whatever food i have before i go to the grocery store. it's good to cook before the grovery store, get a handle on supplies and ingredients, as well as a full belly.

      tonight at the spiderhouse i saw quite a few nipples. i was across the way at shawn's place, where everyone was drunk from racheal's wedding, and singing guitar songs, when debbie said she felt like getting naked. i teased her about it a little, but then this guy cory got naked instead. next thing you know, everyone but debbie was n-a-k-e-d, naked. and tits and ass and cock-balls everywhere, and singing of more guitar songs, etc.  so it was funny cause debbie was all like "i've never been around a naked boy before" and all this, and we were teasing her, but she was a good sport and hung around while we sung sublime songs and watched  barraca .   deb's  urlLink blogpod entry  on the matter is especially funny.   earlier tonight i bussed tables. it was my first time closing the restaurant, and my first saturday night. i made $30 in tips. woo hoo.  recently i think i'd been feeling pigeonholed in my life... not sure why, but it was making me uptight. well, going to julie's party last night, and hanging with the kids today made a difference in that. i've been feeling much more live and let live recently. bless you.

      just got back from julia's. i haven't seen her but once in ages. she rocks my world so completely i can't distinguish left from right. freestyle. pizza. beer. 5 am. keg.  this party i went to i saw so many people i had not seen in a long time: hannah, beth, beth, joe, and amy. hannah told me that angi, who was my first girlfriend, has been married and divorced and has a kid. wild. it took me a second to process that one. joe turned the rumors i'd heard about tia's whereabouts into substantiated fact. it's amazing how much these people, some of whom i haven't seen in more than 5 years, haven't changed all that much. julie still signs, beth lg still squeals when appropriate, and beth b's photo portfolio rocked. amy looked just like amy, but even though she was wearing her trademark black tank top and jeans, she swore she wears colors now.   brandon and evan also stopped by, which was another interesting twist to a night of reunions. maybe we'll start a band of puma-wearing welders or something.  i fell asleep on the couch next to julie, and woke up cause i had to pee and this girl emily was grinding her pelvis upon mine. it's like you don't want to be a sour-puss in that sort of situation, 'cause she's obviously having fun with her hot self, but when you gotta pee, it really cuts into the enjoyment.  i should invite julia down to roller-derby, if she's not already gonna be there.

      jeff, anthony and i went to Joy tonight, played chess, and hung with mariah and nancy. and skittles. thinking about the experience has my mouth watering. the specter of chess in the strip club was unexpected by all. skittles' friend put a few of the pieces in her panties; for attention. then this dude kendric, who attends the cologne and towels in the restroom, nearly check-mated jeff, but took a draw in the endgame. it's rare to see someone push jeff in chess.  i'm listening to the coup sing 'wear clean drawers / everyday / 'cause you don't know / if shit gonna fall the wrong way.' and it feels good. it's nice finally to have some time alone. i've got to work all day tomorrow and saturday night (making good with Lauren the busser.) green pants, black shirt.  i've been mulling the mariah thing over, and if i withheld sex, it wouldn't be about the sugar-daddy. i think i'll be more comfortable once the issues of birth-control and vd are resolved. which stands to reason. it's just so hard to go back to a condom after you've graduated to the real thing.

      mariah came over drunk and elated last night ... she's got a sugar daddy. a regular from the club took her out to dinner last night and kept throwing money at her. like 20 bux or 50 bux here and there. when she showed up at my place she was plastered and had around $800.   today she's meeting up with him again to get a cell phone and her car insurance paid. i guess i'm happy for her, 'cause everyone likes money, but it seems like a slippery slope, as it were.   i'm not sure what to do. i'm thinking of withholding sex.

      i'm just getting back from the lunch shift, with a bowl of spicy penne pasta and chicken, to an empty apartment. mariah was here when i left, but i guess i get to have this food to myself. i've got to go back at around 4 today, dressed in green and black for more waiter training. today will be much busier, so i've got to be sharp. maybe a nap is in order. today is payday.  last night we went up to the 'rents house for salmon and because my uncle mark was in town. i took a side trip to the home depot with mark to find pull-chains for grandma's new ceiling fan. you'd think they'd have more than four kinds - picky, picky. but we did get some that will work.  does anybody else here vastly prefer the sensation of unprotected sex? i guess a trip to the P.P. is in order, to check on my clean bill of health (i abhor you, curtis) and pick up an order of orthocyclone.

      i'm relieved to see that love has not forsaken me. this girl i know is cool with things, and so the future's looking up. i don't know where or why, but i'm feeling good.  and bad. it comes and goes, but work today was stressful stage. i waited on the hardemans, and mr. massey at the next table. geneva was very excited to see me. i remember picking four-leaf clovers on her front lawn. work - i left feeling lucky and triumphant. how did i get this job?  i've been hanging out with hank mostly since work got off. i'm letting him sit on my front porch even though i'm sleeping. we hit one and sung gospel and blues, up here and in the parking lot. hank states his occupation as 'panhandler'. he was excited to see my copy of doestevksy.

      had a great time last night with Mariah. went to the Triplets of Belleville (fun and strange) which was proceeded by a Dali animation called  urlLink  Destino  , which was one of the most beautiful animations i have ever seen. it can't quite be described, but that it is full of Dali's madness and of Jungian depth and complexity.   hot news: my phone is out pending my paying the bill, so if you wan't to call me you should just  email me  instead. I'll pay it asap.

      i don't know why, but i woke up crying today. i almost forgot this until just now, but i've remembered because the feeling came again.  mariah is back, i think we will see a movie. i earned some dollars today moving antiques for reese's dad's friend susan, so if i budget right, i'll have some fun and some finances. i introduced myself to the new neighbors and i think i made a total fool out of myself. i think josh will be living alone in the big house, although he had two girls with him. it's nice to have girls around.

      "Does it not follow, then, that, as for lovers the sight of beloved is the thing they love most, and they prefer this sense to the others because on it love depends." - Aristotle, N.E. IX. 12.  tonight the show came through hardcore. jack, jeff, cobo foofaroo, and DJ moblin gave us what may have been one of the best SXSW shows. all the neighbors were there, with dancing and children and violins. i hope again soon to see cobo fooraroo.

      i've been lazy so far today (good feeling). i slept late, i ate toast w/o toasting it. when i fix my computer there are many things i will be able to do, cheif among them listen to "gone too far" from  the blizzard  that's been playing in my head all day but exists only on old Temptation Island, belly-up as she is.  hayden, debbie and laurel were hanging out last night when hank scared deb and laurel off by being gruf and drunk. well, laurel might have been scared off by the lesbian dance party we were contemplating, but debbie definitely took off once hank came to sit with us. ohwell. free show at emo's i might see her there.  update: the guys at the AA meeting were all just saying the lord's prayer, and i was getting deja-vu. weird.

      not so much. thanks marian for your recounting of the power of the rocking party knee slide. sounds like my kind of party. i haven't had access to a big wood floor for some time, but next party i can, i'll havta raise a scene.  umm, update: so the show will go on - talked to melissa manager. she said 5-10 is cool. 10 cuz they don't want to be too loud for the neighbors. ahem. i am the neighbors. last night the people working hit us with some rad-o Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat, a Dashboard Confessional side-project pre-release. i don't mind good music at all, and this was it (despite the lameness of D. C.) So anyway, at 1:45 am i'm trying to go to sleep, and rattattattat ends and they put on some fucking Fannypack. no. this is after 10. i am the neighbors. new rule: no Fannypack after 10.

      fucking spiders! so i'm busting my ass to provide quality entertainment around here. i've been working for weeks to build up a regular saturday evening crowd. this weekend is probably the most important in terms of exposure, last show was the first time it seemed that most of the crowd was there for the show, and i've been putting together a more exciting line-up to mark the twin occasions of SXSW and Spring Break. so then this bitch (and i don't use the term lightly) of a spider, i guess she's near the top of the pecking order of the baristas - is acting strangely. i mean, she doesn't seem open to communication, has a beef with me, and i don't know why, i can only guess. she's invited a friend's reggae band to play next week (fine by me, even though it displaces the music & audience i've worked so hard to create.)  but whatever... Conrad, owner of the coffeeshop and my landlord, has picked up on "resistance" from the staff. seems he should be telling them what to do and not vice-versa, but that's not my place to say. so he told me to run my plans by the staff - the first guy i talked to was totally cool with it, then Melissa (argghh!) comes out and I explain to her that I'm just planning on doing what i do everyweek, only special cause it's special saturday. she proceeds to call me 'rude' and 'presumptuous' and tells me i should have brought it up with her earlier. since when she became the boss around here i don't know, but i've been talking to the owner for weeks, so fuck her. i politely tell her the i'm not being rude, and that i "this is me consulting you". when people have hidden agendas, it is just so immature. i'm a big kid and i can have the "OK so you work here of course your friend's band can play but don't piss on my parade about it" conversation with her. but instead she just calls the weekly rain or shine show we've been doing "sporadic" (even though she doesn't work saturday nights). what a ho.  so melissa, i'm all ears. and even though i want badly to bite you, i see that red hourglass on your belly and i ain't gonna touch that shit. word.

      i live above the Science Bear Arcade - a saturday market of sorts that purveils an astonishing variety of junk/art. on the 20th of SPRING BREAK, saturday will be about more than just 'terrorist' T's and uncollectables, there will be a professional magic show from "Mike the Magician." mike has blinking pins for $3. jack and marie will be present, and the youth i've never had is flowing through my veins.   log: i had a conversation earlier with isaac. we discussed quotation marks around the word 'sweet'.  i've organized my cds, but they are quickly losing their form. discipline, that's what i need.  my meeting with Mike was very educational. Cyrus might like to meet him.  Saturday will be Mardi Gras.  i've done this before.  who, what?  no one knows why.  i was blessed by an indian by the name of Hawk earlier tonight. it was hard to dicern where the prayer turned into a story, but i did my best to understand. i had just given him implements with which to draw. 4 reds and a grey, and two one-sided drawing papers. some of Hank's acquaintences understand me, it seems.  we talked about honesty and truth. i suppose it's hard to know the relationship between those two. can you say  honesty = truth ? surely they are not identical, but they seem related. ah, enough philosophy.

      work work work. don skipped out today, so the rest of us had to pick up the slack. i have leftovers in the fridge.  yesterday: after sxsw, a spontaneous party formed at my apartment, around my dad's bottle of cheap scotch. even homeless Hank came by. i smoked and smoked the free cigarettes i got from the american spirit promo lady, even though i'd meant to bum them out. i hooked it up with a young lady, she sews and silkscreens, but doesn't seem to understand the virtue of the one night stand. i hope Mariah's having fun in San Diego.  i got a DJ and two bands for saturday. this will be bigger than mardi gras... not. la-me.  the david byrne thought: "here is a building / aren't buildings just the greatest / i wish i had a pet"  the at dusk thought: "i'm spinning / girls are awesome but they can make me sad / my shoe is on fire"  aside from those differences, my listening trek through talking heads "best of" is showing me more similarities between the two groups. especially the snare sound and the guitar interplay.  "don't you worry 'bout me."

      here i am at the sxsw tradeshow, which is the requisite 77% lame. bright spots: Austin Wireless might help me distribute music I like to people using iTunes and free hot-spots around town. they are a non-profit, open organization, so maybe i'll go to the next meeting, on Monday.  also, magnatune.com might be a good way for mfdz to offer music downloads. they seem to have similar philosophies about the artist / label relationship, just different ways to distribute the music. I got magnatune contact info for Greg and Jem.   oh, and EFF Austin has a booth with free stickers. what do i have that needs sticking?  work today: medium well. my second hot coworker appeared, doesn't seem taken (like the first), and told me about a dream she had involving cunnilingus.   OK, my parking meter's almost drained, gotta go frankenstein the laptop some more.

      1) i've developed an aversion to ketchup. it's just too sweet and tangy. those who know me well will wonder what happened to the guy who used to call certain foods "an excuse for ketchup". i don't know how it happened. maybe in my thirst for sustenance, looking at the available molecules in my fridge (ketchup, hot sauces, cheddar and romano cheeses, and ice cream) makes the ketchup seem like a tease, hinting at its fruit-like properties, even with a big story on the back about lycopene. oh ketchup, be gone, convert thyself into freshly roasted portabellos or something. what's better: cheese, or cheese and ketchup? (oh how i long for a bread product!)  2) the only person who reads my blog is me. at least today. the little hit counter to the right, measure of my futility. each painstaking increment corresponding to one of my meager stabs at connectedness. foolish - there are real people right in my front yard, and the last few days have been especially full of friends and fun. (i just got upwards of 5 hugs at shawn's house, and i haven't even brushed my teeth today.)  3) i don't recycle. this isn't so much something i learned as something i did. first i carefully sorted my glass into brown, green, and clear, then i tossed it all in the dumpster together. at least my kitchen doesn't smell as much like beer. it's probably naive of me to think that smelling beer has nutritional value, anyway.

      last night was a doozy. went to alison's party, tripped with reese and anthony. ate ice cream. hung with debbie. yeah debbie! today i'm feeling anti-social, and i'm not having much luck getting my apartment clean. and my computer, not this one i'm typing on, but my real computer, my lovely powerbook - the screen has died. i'm gonna go in with a screwdriver later tonight. but for now, i have only this PC. i knew something was up earlier today when my hard drive started making horrible noises, so i did get some backups done. emails, ichat logs, reason tracks. those are all saved. the rest... we'll see.

      Took this  urlLink silly test  at match.com (linked from  urlLink J1B ). they got some stuff right, some stuff wrong. detailed results were intersting. i'm picky, they say. hte most interesting thing was one where they showed how i rated girls versus the average rating. no surprise that the bitchy white girl i rated a 5 came out like 9 or something on average. i just don't like 'em that severe. the main problem: they hardly had any cute girls to choose from. the best part: rating a series of boobies.   	   		  			 &nbsp;  		  	  			  	 Thanks for taking Match.com's  Ph.D.-formulated Physical Attraction Test , a revolutionary development in the world of relationships. This scientific system will help you narrow your search for those who are truly compatible with your physical preferences.   				Below is the summary of your report. To view your complete test results,  urlLink click here.    				Or  urlLink click here  to search for single Match.com members who you'll find physically attractive.   				  				  	  Favorite Qualities        Your photo choices suggest a woman over 45 is probably getting a little old for your tastes       You seemed interested in dating a woman at least 25 or older       Pretty women       So-called "Ecto-Mesomorphs," with narrow chins and nicely angular faces       Blonde hair       Red hair        .phys_DarkGrayBold_11 { 	font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 	font-size:11px; 	font-weight:800; 	color:#333333; 	}	      Favorite Looks     You seem to have a thing for &quot;Fiery Redheads.&quot; Although pretty rare, this type caught your eye in the photo test. Their deep (even auburn) red hair frames their beautiful, fair skin. You probably even have an appreciation for freckles! As the name suggests, this type tends to convey a sense of energy and confidence that you have to be around. Maybe that's why 1 in 3 men (29%) find these redheads very appealing.       You also appreciate &quot;Delicate Beauties.&quot; They have fine features, like pointed chins and small (or sharp) noses set in long, narrow faces with high cheekbones. They're sometimes referred to as &quot;classic beauties,&quot; because of their very feminine and sophisticated look. About 1 in 5 men (19%) find these women irresistible.     Favorite Face Type     Faces known scientifically as "Ecto-Mesomorphs" repeatedly caught your eye. Women express this type in two ways. One version has a rectangular face shape that is long and narrow. The other type's face shape is often compared to a diamond or a heart, because it is wide at the cheeks and then has a sharply angled jaw. Ecto-Mesomorph women have either delicate pointed chins or chins that are slightly squared-off or rounded at the base. This "classic" face type is one of the most idealized for women and can be found on most movie and music idols. These women also tend to have lean, but shapely, builds when they're young. About 57% of other men especially prefer women with this face type.

      friendster - i haven't been there in awhile.   i deleted my first post yesterday. the one about Steve Martin and the senators. work today wasn't quite as nice as yesterday, mostly because people weren't totally surprised to see that i know what i'm doing. i think there's a strong chance of my becoming a waiter soon. seems a challenge. training will help. i guess it's not that hard, but it's always been a job i don't identify with (despite a growing curiousity).   mariah'll be out of town for a week, driving to san diego. i told her to go up to santa cruz. claire will you be there? iCal says ... yes. "iCal says what?" "what?" ha. it's spring break for all the bunnies down here. perhaps i will feast upon blood.  i decided getting high doesn't help me keep the apartment clean. i should have a super-cleaner, get this place ship-shape. and quit smoking. its easy, i know, it's just hard to want to. also impossible to avoid people who just give it away, and who can refuse free shit? had free beer last night, from two sources. today, free lunch (i worked for it) of eggplant, grits and chicken breast. and i got to make my own latte today. i am a lucky boy, although I didn't quite pull off the stumptown heart.  in the future, I will have a server space, so that I can offer non-textual content on this site. how would you like to hear my version of ...?  probably 'medium'. So quiver with anticipation, my flock.  nuclear war: in the car, listening to terri gross interview the author of  Left Behind , i imagined the horizon bursting into flame, and the cars flying backwards down the street from the capitol, and crushing everything for 25 miles around. from a briefcase.  music: all is full of love - death cab  i'm on my 4 hour break now. back in two.

      "Rescue workers reported hearing the eerie ringing of cellphones on the bodies of the victims as desperate relatives tried to contact their loved ones." -  urlLink The Globe and Mail  recounts the aftermath in Madrid. i can hardly read the whole article. This story had been on the edge of my radar all day, now it's finally hitting home. This could be here. I have friends who could be there.  To me this only reinforces the point that the way to stop terrorism isn't to fight it, to war with it. Terrorists will only have easier access to weapons or the tools to make them as the years go by. Truly, a determined individual could do something this destructive unassisted - the motivation for these attacks needs to be removed. Cultural understanding, education of everyone, cultural outreach, a willingness to work toward peace. These are the things we need most in this crisis. Every military action to curb terrorism has left near-anarchy in its wake. Addressing issues like world poverty, equal rights, and government corruption - manifesting American power as goodwill, rather than shock and awe, is the only way to make positive change. This is what I'd like to be hearing from the president. Wouldn't you?

      woke up this morning cold and alone, which coupled with my grogginess set me in an emotional tailspin. mariah was asleep on my couch and i wondered why... did i scare her off? did i keep her up tossing and turning? i was worried and upset, but when i told her that, she asked "why?" in a way that made me know there was nothing to worry about. thank god for sweet nothings.  at about nine i talked to conrad, who granted jeff and i the privilege of continuing the saturday night show, at least through SXSW. his business partner John was there, also. i resisted the urge to tell them that the Spiderhouse serves crap coffee. "oh by the way you serve crap coffee."  the first day of work; cast of characters: me buzz sarah don melissa brent jason old ladies hard of hearing josephine  buzz, sarah, don and jason are the waiters, josephine washes dishes, jason's a flaming homo, sarah replies to the question of how long has she worked there with a weary, "four years, off and on", don thinks most things are crazy, and is always flipping spoons and ketchup bottles, brent is the busboy, and buzz is buzz, shaved head and all. my job is to wipe down the glass doors when i arrive, seat people and keep up with water and iced-tea, and wipe down the menus before i leave. i get $8/hr, plus about $8 worth of free food per shift. the shrimp tacos were tasty.  the old ladies hard of hearing came in, and i sat them, at one of our less prestigious tables. they moved, explaining that the old table was too loud. there were also a few babies and preggers ladies, and some gruff business dudes. many people have a hard time deciding whether inside or outside is for them. not jim hightower. he went straight outside.  once i had to wipe cream from the floor by the door. knock on wood, i never fucked anything up. also, working at Papa Haydn's, and downloading the T-bot's OS, gave me the habit of eschewing idleness, and moving fast. everyone thought i was the shit, or kept their mouth shut, or both. i wish i got tipped-out.   now i'm home, and jeff should be by later, but i hope he doesn't try to make me think. he's always wanting to do that, but he doesn't understand how lazy i like to be sometimes. i've started being lazier just in protest. did i listen to relative pitch yet? no, mom. maybe i should just admit that i don't care about being a musician, or learning about music. but that's not true.  right now i'm listening to Telefon Tel Aviv and . . .

      guess who's got to be at work tomorrow at 10:30... me! I stopped by the Granite Cafe, a place I'd always thought of working, but that was at the top end of the spectrum in terms of qualification. What, Granite Cafe will take me but not Trudy's? Did I hear that right? So, this place is actually about as close as you can get to Papa Haydn's, minus the desserts, if that makes any sense. I feel ready. I'm pumped. I'm taking home tips, soon. Melissa will be training me tomorrow for hosting the lunch shift, and I'm gonna bust up and kick ass. The job is just lunch hosting, with possible Friday night bussing, but damn, that sounds perfect. now here comes all that money from the fax project. I'm already dressed just right.

      Formulated on high and in a foreign language, the law was the stigmata of the foreign presence, the mark of another nation. In legal practice, right was formulated in a foreign tounge, and what I would call the "linguistic sufferings" of those who could not legally defend themselves in thier own language were compounded by the fact that the law looked foreign. The practice of the law was inaccessible in two senses. Hence the demand that appears so often in medieval England: "We want a law of our own, a law that is formulated in our own language, that is united from below, on the basis of common law, as opposed to royal statutes."   -M. Foucault

      grandma's in the hospital, but she's a tough lady and she should be out soon. i took her some stuff yesterday, and it's actually kind of fun to find my way through the labyrinth of halls and elevators and courtyards and stuff.   last night we found this tiny party at nick's house. we almost didn't find it, driving around, and getting out at beer-wandering, and getting back in the car again... but just as we gave up we saw familiar vehicles, and repeated the party-ears experiment, till we settled on a house to walk into without knocking. nick plays piano and may come to the show tonight.  chess / prokofiev. and then when we got home i did one of those cooking numbers, creating a big pot of pasta with produce and queso. yums.

      this morning an image of Bush, tripping over the world trade center; media analysis - newsmakers are not being gentle on bush in this game. everyone want to show that they can and will stand up to him despite his lubricated media histroy.  this has been a campaign of steep CNN antipathy toward an early, strong, candidate. Dean faced 2004 at the top of the charts, soon garnering Gore's endorsement. this endorsement, people inside the campaign say, focused a lazerbeam of negative attention on Dean. it was at this point that Kerry first felt his mortgage-induced surge. then, the weekend before Caucus, and no camera's around. They were all following a feeding frenzy of media gloss paid for by Kerry's mortgage lenders (ie. the federal reserve).  The final weekend, coverage of Dean was close to minimal, as viewed in Iowa, up to the night before caucus. Then afterwards, Dean exploded onto the scene. The scream was enough to dampen New Hampshire, and hence the rest of the primaries. so from a tall start to a cheap fall and then out. and interveiwed by Diane Sawyer and Given a Second Change in the wisconsin primary. where did he get all that money?  well, if the deomcrats want to learn how to beat money, they'd better practice on Dean. But they also need his money, his fundraising prowess, and his suppporters. A Kerry / Dean ticket wouldn't look wrong on anyone's volvo.  Will Bush take a Dean tumble? The media's early reaction seems that they may have learned a few tricks this primary season, for the clash of the titans in Nov. I think this one is gonna get out of hand. at least a couple of WTO's and a World Bank. The Media could easly turn this into a very divisive campaign. I'd perfer if they set it up as the powers of good vs the powers of evil. time to Move On.  bush all dressed up for his UN speech. holding Ricky Marten's hand at the Inaguration. on the aircraft carrier, or wearing glasses when the polls show he's a dumbass.  maybe i'll start a photogallery. send me your bush pics, where its obvious he is broken, and I'll make a memory wall.    "kumbiya, my lord, kumbiya" and all this shit.

      song in my head: "you don't love me yet" as sung by Roky Erickson.  hurray, so Marian has a  urlLink bloggety-blog . I can't want to hear about her cantankerous adventures in the Old World. here's a shout out to which I know of only one answer: "COCK-BALLS!"  today is rainy, the Incredibly Exciting Job Opportunity has become the incredibly silent job opportunity, and i've been thinking. at this point, I should only be applying for jobs that either A) are so durn cool that I'd make great sacrifices to do them (ie. not travel, ie, only I.E.J.O. qualifies) or B) allow me to travel. I've got to at least go to Cyrus' graduation in May, at the very least. But I've also got places to go, things to do, people to see. Where's my sugar-mama?  I am alone in the world.  You guys know how Ambien will fuck with your brain? so I took one the other night at my parents' place, and instead of falling asleep, I stayed up watching my face get distorted in the mirror. I couldn't count the number of eyes i had, maybe 4, 6, or two, but mostly i think there wasn't a number that applied. all the while i was having a tough time telling up from down, etc. and then i drew a self-portrait, apparently, cause i found it in the morning. rather fun, i'd recommend for all you insomniacs out there. next stop: Ambien music, like ambient, only,  different.

      went to taco bell today - and tripped everyone up in the process. to begin with, i  walked into  the restaurant. after they finished apologizing for having to change out the cash drawer before they could deal with me, i asked:  "what's the cheapest burrito ya'll have?  "..."  "well then how much is a cheesy bean and rice burrito?"  "..." (too much to get 3 of them)  "ok, i'll have the frito burrito, hey, does that have the cheese from the cheesy bean and rice burrito and the cheese quesadilla?"  "..." (turns out those aren't the same cheese anyway - but the guy i talked to was trained in customer service, not taco architecture, so what does he know?)  "ok, two of those."  "..."  "wait, i thought they were $1.29"  (ok so they want to charge me 45¢ a buritto for the nacho cheese.)   "can i have just regular frito burritos, then?"  "..."  so i end up with one regular and one nacho frito burrito, and i have no idea what they charged me for. the point is, when you go to taco bell, don't ask questions. not that i didn't enjoy myself, far from it, but to stray anywhere from the standard practice in such an engineered environment is efficiency suicide. i should'a driven through. i wonder what would happen to pepsico if everyone who went to taco bell asked a question?

      how rss will change the world  rss is a new internet protocol, like email or the world wide web. like email or the world wide web, rss is unique in the ways it allows humans to communicate. i doubt you'll see rss feed links on television commercials in the future, but that won't make it any less ubiquitous. rss is like email without the spam, like the world wide web in terms of publication, and unprecedented in its ability to enhance human communication.   personal blogs, shared by mostly your friends and family, can create more than a forum for punditry, they keep people in touch, spread new ideas and include viewpoints unusually accessed.  the protocol has the potential to further extend the humanizing power of the internet that will be fully felt when even the poorest are well versed. it behooves us to make sure that the correct standard is adopted. open, extensible, and free.  ----  is that polemical? 'how rss will change the world' by c____. ha. you guys know who i am.   take for instance ______'s blog. one of the finest, but as of yet unsyndicatable, so it doesn't get the reading it deserves. with all the drama and confessional nature, and the hot girl on girl action, her blog would be at the top of the charts.  everytime an update is posted to a blog you are subscribed to, an angel gets its wings. just kidding - but your rss reader checks subscribed blogs with an adjustable frequency. updates are then available for your perusal at any time. also available for subscriptions are rss feeds of political and corporate nature. (propaganda, all of it?)   the protocols of the web, email, and blog/rss can be can compared using the ideas of push and pull media. push media, like spam, sends signals to you without your intervention. think of tv, when you've not been watching it but have left it on. another aspect of the push of email is that the sender has to specify the receiver. this takes time and also ensures that the recipient has to encounter the little bit of noise it takes to filter and triage incoming messages.  these are among the reasons email has come into disfavor - chief among them being spam. the web doesn't suffer from spam, and blocking pop-up windows is easily done, but just in creating a web page where one spouts one's views, or hawks a tonic, or whatever, doesn't promote same reaction it would if your visitors were given a simply way to read the content of said rantings, as well as to be notified when new rantings were made available (is a word i'll never learn to spell).  i think i need to get back in school. i could be a super-genius record producer mobile mogul if i only had that phd.  the reenactment bunny is alive and well. time for produce.

      last night got odd. after i blogged and was getting ready for bed,  creepy kyle  (new in the 'hood - he gets defensive when asked about his past) showed up and wanted to hang. "what are you guys doing? ... oh, that's what i was about to do!" etc. then he starts talking about mushrooms and did we want any and "where's zach?" (who's zach?)  and about 30 seconds later, these kids come in the front door, all wild-eyed, with a big yellow plastic bag full of shrooms. it was seriously past my bedtime, but i let them break up thier bounty (from the fields, that night) on my chessboard. maybe when they are dried out i'll get one.  in the midst of the turmoil that is my life right now, there's been one constant: excitment about my visit to portland. it looks like work is gonna get covered. i've been reading up on my shelly yakus and other engineers. seeing amy after all these months. good beer. intellectual stimulation. greenery.

"so, tell me something."  worked ...  blah, $, ok. going back in a couple of hours. at least i don't have to think when i'm there. this not being able to record shit is getting O-L-D. need new computer. arg/1!

       I believe it is very important that the object of sexual attraction is a particular individual, who transcends the properties that make him attractive. When different persons are attracted to a single person for different reasons: eyes, hair, figure, laugh, intelligence--we feel that the object of thier desire is nevertheless the same, namely that person. There is even an inclination to feel that this is so if the lovers have different sexual aims, if they include both men and women, for example. Different specific attractive characterstics seem to provide enabling conditions for the operation of a  single basic feeling , and the different aims all provide expressions of it. We approach the sexual attitude toward the person through the features that we find attractive, but these features are not the objects of that attitude.  - Thomas Nagel, "Sexual Perversion" (1969).  more reading. last night S called me, unsure whether our date this weekend was a good idea. i tried not to be too persuasive. it's her call really, but as of yet i am not uninvited. and i'm still excited. i have no idea what to expect, but i know the intense emotional effect this girl has on me, and a longer duration could be like a drug.  i've been thinking about her an awful lot. that, i didn't expect.  small things: having the door open with no visitors. keeping my shoes organized. taking out the trash. whitening toothpaste. mystery. out-of-towners. musical chairs. audience participation. tippers. animals in disguise.

      so claire i think your suggestion is right on. last night i called her and read a couple of poems and got a date to spend the night this weekend. sounds fan-fucking-tastic! (as it were)  i'm thinking maybe putt-putt golf beforehand, then ecstasy and wine. more likely maybe just wine.  today is my mom's birthday and i got her those little clips that hook onto wine glasses, and we had lunch at the restaurant and melissa bought her free dessert and it was yummalicious.  i'm reading  real live nude girl  which is about the politics of bisexuality. and she (the author) longs for a bisexual community and feels ostrasized from both hetero and homosexual groups. and she also talks about not wanting to categorize, but also wanting to categorize. and i come down hard on the side of not wanting to categorize, because there's more freedom there, but carol queen (the author) wants categories to aid in the fight for freedom. maybe i'm just getting the long end of the stick (as it were) by living in cities and cultures that are pretty welcoming of alternative sexualities. the book is obviously written before the faddishness of girls kissing girls. err, "going wild."  back to the point. politics and sex. i agree, politics and the mainstream (of non-austin/non-portland places) today do not do justice to the freedom people deserve and the variety of ways they choose to observe that freedom. so anyway - i'm also close to finishing this other book  the conquest of cool  about how the ad industry in the 60's in some cases prefigured the ideological changes that decade is famous for. does prefigured mean caused? i'm skeptical, but thomas frank argues that point. if he's right, then maybe by going into advertising, i can change the world for the better, so that people no longer have to entrench themselves in identity politics just to fight injustice. trenches can become prisons, and if the battles the LGBT movement is fighting were won (over with, "done and done"), then i doubt many people would find cause to entrench themselves (at least over sexuality).  can i help the war with advertising? can i encourage a shift in the zeitgeist that would make an end run around identity politics and "the culture wars"? maybe not alone, but i think i've found some new intellectual kindling to spark.

      so remember when i wished we didn't have to sleep. well, last night elliott, nicki, claire, althea, lo, hayden, anthony, hank and i stayed up till 7 am or so, dancing and singing and talking and carrying on. we got milkshakes when the sun came up, and then we said our goodbyes out front of katz's, which never closes.   i'm gonna miss those girls. hands down the most vibrant, intelligent group of sparkly stars to come through my life in a long time.  i had the kind of fun i don't think i've had since the last time my jaded-o-meter clicked its last click to the clockwise. who knew that you could contact improv to "go to (the bottom)" or that it would be so much fun?  i think it might be the season for falling in love, but maybe it's just the company i've been keeping lately. falling in love with any of these girls would be par-for-the-course, but i think i'll fall in love with none of them 'cause it's more eternal that way. and less complicated.  now they are driving back to houston and i'm thinking about arranging a visit...   and if you close the door we'd never have to see the day again (once more)

      today was a whirlwind. i've been feeling alternately depressed and excited, hungover and sharp, hopeless and loved. elliott is back in town with his crew, four creative and funny girls who sing and play the piano and make up ads for fanciful multi-colored cigarettes, set to the tune of "california dreaming." i wish we could stay awake forever.   but they got tired so i'm home. what else today? 14 person party on my porch, quite unexpected, but better than most such events, in that it was short, and involved chess and brazilian guitar playing. laurel and katie were there, and jeff and anthony and carib and (now i'm just reciting names) robert and robert and another elliot and isaac and more people talking about picking shrooms.  and before that stacey and i had one of our quiet cuddles (or were we making out?), with the deep gazes etc. and she said she doesn't talk to me because she doesn't want to get to like me too much, and i think i'm getting to like her a little. it's almost involuntary. she's a morning person. mysterious. something about her makes me deeply uncomfortable and at the same time totally at ease. proceed with caution.  and now those girls are singing to me from shawn's porch:  all the cigs are purple and they're yellow too if you want to smoke one you know what to do

      i just got kicked out of my first show ever. i'm a little drunk, but as i recall, i was in a (tame) moshpit, dancing, when some guy got me in a full nelson. i thought "oh just more fun" but he started dragging me toward the exit. i pulled the go limp on the ground maneuver, but he3 didn't let go, after a fe minutes pf wrestling, he had me out the back door, sans girly glasses.   so the bouncer woulsn't let me back in, and my glasses were nowhere to be seen, but it was worth it. i've never been kicked out of a show before, and it was Peaches.  I went to La Cucaracha to recuperate and drink, and bum smokes, and then Debbie gave me a ride home.

      today for lunch i had a steak sandwich, all cooked rare and served cold. cold and bloody, with green soup. i think it was leftover from some exhibition last night. i'm just glad for a break in the routine. aside from that, work today was blah. i didn't really talk to anyone or hang out, so i didn't mind leaving early. what makes up for it is that Peaches is playing tonight and Debbie and i are planning to go. i hope she's packing.  last time i saw debbie she was wearing an artificial penis in her pants. she even let me touch her package. it was upside down, proof that she's a real lesbian. so i told her she had her dick on backwards, and we had a good laugh. if dennis hopper were a joker, he'd say "How's it hanging?" and debbie would say "hanging?" 'cause that's how much of a lesbian she is.  nothing else is new. i let this girl robin crash on my couch last night, and anthony on the floor, so hopefully tonight the population will be a little lower. i haven't seen mariah in almost a week. i don't think she likes peaches. anyone who calls an album 'fatherfucker' i'm down with. makes me think of george micheal.

      just watched a  urlLink dvd  nova  episode , about the structural engineers charged with examining the wtc collapse and its antecedents. a close look at this story is something i think i've been avoiding. its just so hard to reconcile my expectations as per the flag crowd, and my feelings, which are vauge, that is, unstudied and unsettling. quiet saturday night. i've been ignoring knocks at my door.  the buildings were largely evacuated by the time of the collapse, with the exception of people in and above the crash zones, who were "already lost" in the words of one fireman, and emergency workers themselves, who were still there when no one else could have been saved. but it is that moment, which haunts. the buildings fell so fast.   is our interest in the collapse a reaction to failure of human ingenuity - mortal towers? or do we project our subjectivity into the people left on floors which "pancaked"? the collapse means something more than the attack alone, perhaps it is symbolic of defeat.   wondering would i have jumped from above the impact site, or stayed inside with the fire... i hope that decision would never have to come to me; i'd hope to be in the core, running down burning stairs, trying to get out.

      marian really has a way with words, doesn't she? so i sent my sister a link to my blog and then i posted the waterbondage.com link and i guess now that could be a cause for feeling akward (google asks, "did you mean:  awkward "), but i'm a good soldier and i left my awkward at my last meeting with stacey, who makes it feel so good to be strangely out of place.  drove my taxes in last night at midnight, trunk flapping in the wind. insurance company is still dragging its feet.   i haven't seen my friend hank in ages, i hope he hopped a train to dallas or something, instead of getting arrested or freezing to death. life on the streets would be tough, i imagine, although maybe not quite as tough as in the jungles of vietnam.  talked with william, my new downstairs neighbor. he just got out of a divorce, and is thinking of going back to school for paleontology. it's amazing that people don't realize that if you're older, and thinking of school, and poor, all you have to do is manage the academic aspects (that is, getting accepted) and then most schools / the government will love to give you a free ride (or a cheap one) and plenty of loans.  and a bit of housekeeping... my travel plans for my brother's graduation are:  Wednesday, May 12 - Austin(AUS) 8:15 am to Nashville(BNA) Saturday, May 15 - Nashville(BNA) to Austin(AUS) 3:40 pm

      so today Mr. Corn did pay me to do something, just not his taxes. and i'm going to get mine done also. alls i have to left to do is get to the post office before midnight.  i just got back from veggie heaven, yummalicious - well almost. now i'm sleepy as a november bear.  the library rocks my socks. i checked out stevie wonder's  songs in the key of life , a nova exposé of the structural failings of the twin towers on dvd,  the conquest of cool  about 60's advertising, and riggledy rawking  rosetta stone: german . i love the library.  and amy called me, and maybe she'll visit, and i talked to sidney from papa haydn's, and brezny says i should be a trifle less wild this week. if my belly stays full like this, he's got a deal. otherwise, all bets are off.  oh, and to the noble reader who suggested i am a perv, how about a link to  urlLink my favorite naked lady website . definitely not worksafe.

      i dreamed last night that i was being paid to do mr. corn's taxes. it was exceptionally easy. the wierd part is, mr. corn, a regular at the restaurant, is a tax accountant with an office next door. so like, he's totally capable of doing is own taxes, and probably mine too. weird, considering i've never done anyone's taxes. he and his crew (they always come in for lunch) were all over at this  tall  house, and then i went upstairs, and mariah was there, and she had a friend on the porch outside the sliding door, and he turned out to be a ZOMBIE!   and then for the rest of the dream it was all zombie-dodging and car crashing. rad. i drove this underpowered ford van through a crowd of zombies who all wanted to eat me, and then i had to race it on the highway, and crash into zombies and cars that zombies were trying to use to stop me. fuck yeah! so i'm crashing this van all around, smashing the undead like popcorn, and then all the sudden i'm at this circus / haunted house thing. only it is staffed entirely by roughly 5th graders, and almost all the attendees are even younger. so i'm dodging zombies in this circus tent full of children dressed in gory halloween costumes, and older kiddos pretending to be dead and stuff. wow. then i got out of the circus, and was jogging back to that tall house, to finish the tax job, and being chased by dogs, who were scared of me whenever i looked them in the eye, but when i went back to running, they chased me again.   eventually i realized this dream would have no logical conclusion, and i wasn't likely to see titties, so i woke myself up, got halfway across the room to get water for the hangover, and realized i was stark naked. (damn, i'm just totally cruising on awesomeness right now.) i wish i could be the guy who doesn't care if my landlord, the neighbors, the guys out back of the laundromat, and the coffee-drinkers see my bare ass and cock balls in the morning, but i'm not that cool, so i stopped, dropped, and rolled back over to where i could put some shorts on, drank a 1/2 gallon of emergen-C, crawled back in bed, and bemoaned my fate as a person with itchy feet until the alarm went off.  now i'm naked again and sitting on my couch which is (mostly) out of view of the window. i wonder how long i can stare at this girl doing chem homework at the spiderhouse before she notices me...

      "ok guys, let's play restaurant!"  jason calls out, clapping like tinkerbell. thus starts another day at the granite cafe. this playing, this stage-acting, it's strange 'cause it's real.   so today this lady called in a to go order, and i told her 15-20 minutes, so she shows up in ten, and melissa's all "rargh rargh rargh" at me, not cause she thinks i should do my job better, but because it is our job as restauranteurs to make it look like i'm in trouble cause her salad's not packed up and ready to go instantaneously. imagine the consequences if melissa had tried to tell the lady the real deal. lies lubricate the wheels of commerce. but are they lies if we're in character?  anthony writes "My name is Chris, I suck!  There's nothing in the world better than licking a pig's ass, I think."  got a disc in the mail from At Dusk. practice space recordings of the band playing new songs. just hearing that stuff took me right back to the glory days of the summer of promises kept and the blizzard of forgotten hope. between parts, i can hear Greg say "sorry" about what i don't know, probably an early change or something, but hearing a band in a room through a little compression... mmrm! its almost like being there. maybe we should just release the super-rough's as a record.

      my mind has been mostly empty the last few days, and my blog too. but not my tummy.  exception: last night as i was falling asleep i had a pretty good historical accounting and perspectivizing session, where i've been, where i'm going, that sort of thing. once again, i'm thinking it would be nice to talk to anova, cause she's always full of wisdom and stuff. maybe i'll call her one of these days.  where i'm going: hopefully into the studio, soon. arghgghgh. how else do i find bands but by word of mouth and posts on craigslist? i've decided that telling my friends to start a band so i can record them isn't the most surefire way to go about it. now that i've got my mac fixed... reason all the time. working on 'just like heaven'.  my toilet is in tip-top shape, but the plumber handled my dishes. weird.

      cooked dinner for myself tonight. pasta with fresh veggies. mmmm. i spent $50 at the grocery store tonight, which is more than i'm used to spending, but now i have some money at all, so cool. supplies like emergen-C and razor blades don't come cheap. i even splurged on a reed's spiced cider.  just finished  the fisher king . lots of little stories in there. jeff bridges before the dude. happy ending.  it kind of killed the mood when i read about the  urlLink sari stampede  which took 21 lives in india. rough. total party foul.

      work was work. i wish the owner, who's been around a lot ever since the thursday grandparent's day debacle, would just RE-LAX. talked to amy after work, yea! now i'm at the parent's for easter bunny day. grandma's here, looking at pictures of her newly discovered granddaughter, my cousin lisa, who was given up for adoption by my aunt holly in the 60s. white wine. deviled eggs.  thinking about 'spotless mind' some more. what i really appreciate about that movie is that most films which try to do something philosophical, fail miserably, err, almost all. usually those lapses in plot-logic are offset by the coolness of some kind of explosion or ghost or whatever, but 'eternal sunshine' didn't have those lapses. it's just so satisfying, like a full bite of cheesecake. the closest thing to a problem was clem's sentience in the dream / erasure process. was she there? did her erasure dream have some overlapping moments? can we chalk it up to the power of love?

      today, stormy, windy, i woke to the noise. 3 pm. i walked out to my porch and spotted carneal and stacey, and invited them up from the rain. stacey's company had the effect of increasing my thoughtfulness level. she's very quiet, but when she speaks, asks hard questions. she won't play trivial pursuit. why do i appreciate her? she's a morning person, one of the rare.  later, dinner with mariah at dirty's, the local burger joint. she insisted on driving because of the rain. the car came in handy afterward at the taco bell drivethrough. we had an extended lay, and then she kicked my ass at chess.  now i'm doing the blog thing, just another way to prevent me from averting my eyes from the screen.

      there is a degree to which 'eternal sunshine' has altered my perceptual reality. moments seem sharper, somehow. especially in the bathroom.  earlier today, isaac proposed a new term: 'assbowl', for the toilet. he'd been talking shit all night. and about his mother.  concert on the porch, it's called improvation. dinner at mesa hills cafe. hosts, etc. a taste of my own medicine.   texpresso coffee. a museum machine. chillum in the car. eternal pacing.  that movie was well paced. mary is alone, then clem reacts to what she's done. themes - the music, entrancing. it felt like a dream.  wondering what's next...

      damn today at the granite was like a truckload of bricks dropped on my ass. and everyone else's. apparently it was grandparent's day today at my alma mater St. Andrew's Episcopal School, so the kids got out early and everyone came to the restaurant all dressed up and antsy and hungry and rich. and then the owner came in with her parents and kids, unannounced, and expected me to turn over a reserved table to them. and didn't pay for their meal.  nor did i. the best food from the restaurant i've had was the pasta special today, free with my shift, and i walked with about $40 in tips left over from last night. so i got a sixer of full-sail summerfest on the way home, which really drives home what i truly want / miss right now, beverage-wise, i'm sure you can relate:  1) Blue Heron 2) Mirror Pond - please ... i miss my mediocre beer friend. 3) Kombucha 4) Mac and Jack's African Amber 5) Stumptown (this is a cry for help)  and food-wise: Boccone Dolce and Cassatta  and friend-wise: Greg, Will, Cary, Amy, Lindsay, Anova, Tewin, Hal, Armand, Paige, and of course Cliggledy.  Although if i could only have the company of one of the above right now, it would likely be Mirror Pond. yeah so its obvious i should get my ass back up to portland soon. got paid, we'll see.

      do you ever think you feel your cellphone beginning to vibrate in your pocket, only to realize that it something else entirely, that is, nothing? mariah just called to say she'll be here soon, that was after i typed the last sentence. sometimes precognition comes in trickles.  working a double today. don told me i was the best host they'd ever had at the granite. that was nice to hear, especially because things seemed out of my control today, with people seating themselves and wanting water no ice and all.

      yesterday isaac and i were driving to pick up a copy of cubase from tyler, when, about a block from my apartment, the driver's side window exploded, raining glass all over me. some nicks and cuts, and mission aborted, but mostly an exciting surprise. (i still wish i got that sound on tape.) i suppose something was wrong with the window from the wreck. the insurance company is sure taking its sweet time.  this morning about 7:30 i was awakened by the sound of some sort of tropical storm happening outside, buckets of rain, thunder and hail. today's been sunny.  after work we made music, a couple of jams on the AKAI, and a beat and some chords on isaac's newly acquired old iMac. now i'm thinking of how to get to my parents' house on the bus, rather than in the glassy wet broken car. clean clothes are in short supply.

      media saturation enforces a phenomenology. as our lives have been put in front of the screen, each of us has had greater occasion to ask, "is this real?" questions like those lead inevitably towards skepticism, a memetic state which calls attention to the subjective view, which view itself leads to media production: memento, the matrix, trading spaces, and teenage angst-rock, among others, are examples of media manifesting subjectivities.   (there is a lizard turning green on my porch)  these reflections struck me yesterday as i was listening to proto-angsters Bush sing hits like "Glycerine" and "I don't wanna come back down from this cloud." the mood and content of these sort of songs is an example of an internalization that has come over the popular discourse. in my mind, the stereotypical angst-rock lyric goes something like "i wonder why / i die / you cry / i sigh". the vocalization style has been named "yarling". the combination is a music which is largely lacking in artistic spirit, and which oftentimes even fails at its primary goal of sounding like nirvana (or coldplay (or whatever)). the common denominator (aside from liberal use of Autotune) is a lyrical focus on the innerlife; what makes this genre different from older examples of media subjectivity (think of Billie Holiday singing "Solitude") is its overwhelming musical suckitude - derivitive, and not even of good stuff.  so we've established 1) that angst-rock sucks, and 2) it has introspective lyrics. so what? doesn't everyone already know that? well, my argument is that media exerts a kind of hegemony over the way we think. these popular songs - focus group tested and computer honed - and movies like the matrix series, all single out the interior life for depiction and examination. the inner life is made outer, especially through that most bleeding edge of mediation, the first-person shoot-em-up game. the visual field is mapped to the computer screen, bringing attention to both, and putting them both in the background, as it were, while the action of the game takes place  inside  the screen, inside the visual field.  so our games, our movies, our music - they reinforce in content, the same sorts of thoughts the medium(s) themselves bring upon us. "is this real?" "is it virtual?" "what is this sound inside my head(phones)?"  --- part two if it ever occurs (in reverse order) will further compare old songs and shit to new ones ---  ok, and if any of my learned readership can point in a direction that is helpful to go, like, as in what to read so i'm not talking so much out of my ass, i'll give you a sucker.

      paris hilton has been stalking me the last few days. the last time i saw her, she was chasing the sun across the rocks down at sculpture falls. before that, she was on my front porch, or rather, down on the stage at the spiderhouse. at the time i had no idea what was happening, just that another camera crew was filming, and that the production-director-type seemed a little more uptight than usual. they're always filming shit down there. i guess my only regret is that if i'd known it was her, i could have run my mack program, and by now i might be a bona fide trash tv star.  last night the crew drank and played 'shuffleboard' at the hole in the wall, and then watched  chicago  and  ghost in the shell  which is a great movie. and lost an hour of sleep to the legislature. tonight is my first shift as a waiter at ye olde granite cafe.

      my aches and pains from the crash have mostly subsided, save for a dull swolleness at the front of my neck. i hope that's not from the vampires. apparently, the boy in front of me is filing a claim against me, or more accurately, my godfather's insurance. i'm supposed to give a recorded interview later this afternoon on the matter. clearly i have no responsibility for the accident, the driver behind me admitted it was his fault immediately, he's also a nice guy. his agent already came by and estimated on my car.   working a split shift today. fine by me, but i wish i was waiting. soon, young jedi.  what do you like best, licorice or cinnamon?

      that’s right, you.  i piloted the junker crosstown and back today with anthony, stopping occasionally to retie the trunk shut. we pulled up in front of a bunch of vatos while a-town hopped out and fiddled with the cord, so i put on middle age white blues radio to let them know he wouldn’t be coming back up with a shotgun. destination, suburban studentia, and dealer named dan.  after trial and tribulation, we returned and smoked our bounty with tane, jack, elliott, matt, leslie, and karen with the incisive mind. i joined up with the drunkboys, playing drums and harmonica, and singing while they hammered away. now I’m offline in bed, curled up around my blog.  APRIL FOOLS played jeff hard. 102.3, the classic rock station, had a gathering with free ‘ritas  and beer, and the promise of Jimmy Page in the house. so i picked up the chessboard, jeff took his guitar, and we headed down there. after the belly dancers, a twenty-something black dude got up on the stage wearing a shirt saying “Jimmy Page.” it is his real name. jeff took all evening to get over it.  yesterday’s revelation: billy is hot. today: the night air is hot. resist... air conditioning.

      that's me, today, when things don't quite go my way. last night i was telling amy that i'm usually happy just to take things as they come, that that is sort of my way of finding solace in an uncertain world. that is, if i don't ask for too much it's hard to get dissappointed. but i think i've lost track of what i want - maybe from getting so many things i've wanted all at once.  well yeah so this morning i had planned to try to meet up with some of the people i don't see all the time, but no bones, so then i thought i'd shlep around and clean the house or read, but then shauna showed up ( yeeaa, shauna! )and wanted me to burrito with her, which made me happy so i did it. and now after the session tonight all i wanted was a burger, and i had plans to have one with hal, but he wussed out, so i went to the hedge house, but they only have burgers on tuesdays, so mac and cheese for me. the right idea (of how to make mac and cheese) but still, no bones.  so yeah, all my desires are being thwarted, but by medium-good things. i think my frustration comes from not getting what i  think  i want, because the things that i do get i want allright, too. maybe it's just ennui coming from the downhill leg of my journey. who knows.  it will be nice to switch gears on the album project. we've got all the basics down, so now i get to think differently. noon tomorrow at prexy.

      is there more to life than recording? the gruel continues, but perhaps here i'll catalog some of the non-dusky things that have happened recently. things that i'm happy for.   got a long letter from claire. i haven't heard much from her in the last few months, save the blog, and had let slip from my mind her more serious side, where the wisdom which informs her humour is foremost. how she got so laid-back? probably from her immense sense of perspective. or maybe it just seems like that to me.  my brother is back in austin. he made the drive in record time, and now he's helping my parents be practical. it will be nice to spend time with him when i get back, especially in an environment where i can tell most people apart. (speaking of austin, i haven't heard from anthony in a while, but S says the apartment appears not to have burned down.)  amy and i seem to have reached a new level of comfort with sharing one another's space. my first night of sleep next to her was resoundingly restful, perhaps some sort of relief from what i'd been missing for ages. last night matched the first in effectiveness, but without the aura of the novel. she came to the session today, but left half-way through, 'cause the band wasn't getting anywhere and who would want to be X-factor in a situation like that? i don't think her presense was hampering things, 'cause it took us hours to get a take - but get a take we did.   oh look, i'm writing about recording again. slap on the wrist. goodnight.

      working on this record, whew. takes all my time. i'm incredibly driven to do the work - i have to stop myself from working more, just to stay sane, but i wish my calendar permitted 3 weeks at an all-inclusive resort, with nothing but mimosas and hula-dancers.   i think today i may try to take the reins a little more, at least in terms of guiding the process. i'm almost to the point of having all the old songs mixed enough to be almost done, which once i do that, i'll be able to strategize about what else they need, and then record it. i think today will be a list-making day.  perhaps all this should be on the  urlLink at dusk blog .  in other news, my mom seems like she's gonna be starting at nordstrom again, after being offered the job she wanted while she was there. that's fine by me, as long as she can still think of other things to talk about. maybe join a book club, mom.  and amy and i are about to embark on a yum adventure to brunch, which is like, somewhere between breakfast and lunch. and happens most on sundays. i saw the brunch chef yesterday, he seemed like a cooker.

      i dreamt last night that somehow i was eating at mcdonald's, and the guy behind the counter was my buddy, and he dropped a patty on the ground and reassured me that it was standard practice before putting it though some grinder device operated by a gloved lunch-lady, and it came out looking fresher, with all the gross floor stuff ground to the inside. i managed to get down a few bites, before tossing it aside, tomato and all.  at the horse brass last night with minna and drew, i had some mt. hood beer, the kind they make donuts out of at that coffee shop on the mountain. a stout, fruity and bitter but not to much of either. i also had two scotch-eggs. for the uninitiated, that means i ate two hard-boiled eggs, wrapped in a thick later of sausage, some batter, and deep fried. the best part about it is the honey mustard. the worst part about (two) is the inexhautible supply of gas, and the dreams about meat-handlers.  the waitress felt the need to tell me that she's seen someone take down 4.

      hanging out with greg, cary, and meri has transformed my sense of humor. i'm much more disposed to say something like, "yeah, and then you'll poop all over your mom's coochie" than i normally would. and i like it. you probably will, that is, poop in such a manner. see. gotcha.  it's greg's fault for suggesting i blog as i'm taking down my second blue heron. ah, blue heron, sacred juice. "sacred like fag-sperm", the cary in me wants to say. so anyway, my wheels have been spinning as to how to relocate to portland. it is just obvious to me that this place is where i belong. sorry, my austin friends, i love you, i do, i do, and you too, dad etc, but this place makes me feel whole.  today at the middle school, the janitor, a 40-something asian lady, had some sage advice. will was carrying the second-score odd load of gear to the car during break-down, when she said, "too many stuff." truer words were never said.   but after 3 major gear failures (broken snare, bass, and guitar amp), we got  the take  of arab fiesta, working title of one of atdusk's newest songs. yeah, fat dog.

      so the first day of all-day album work. we spent the first half of the time making crazy purchases: studio projects B3 for m/s overheads, presonus 8channel lightpipe interface for recording, headphones for amy, cary got his amp back, fixed. guitar center was a phenomenological overload, dj mixers on short circut, theft alarms ringing. none of us could think. but we managed to get out of there with the proper cables and gear, i think. and $1,500 poorer. thank god for return policies, hehe.  i'm so excited about the sound of this new mic. the B3 has this hyped low end, and a clarity i haven't heard before in a mic i have the prospect of using, actually. it will make the drums sound like god, i'm sure, i'm not sure what to do for the M mic of the m/s matrix. experiment, i suppose. and did i mention the camcorder, which automatically makes everything audible into super-fun sound, rather than just sound? h-i-t, they should call it, i could clap and sing gibberish (or read this entry aloud), and you'd want to hear it again. and jon is hooking us up with his monitors, so the mixes can be real.  and the way things have been working out with amy, i couldn't be happier. its like we've swung right back into our friendship, only strengthened by the crazy times we put each other through over the last year. there's no question that my being away for six months has been a good thing, but an even better thing might be if i get back to portland. we shall see.   all in all, being back in pdx after such a long absence, had given me lots of perspective on the ways i've changed. i done growed some, it seems.   ok, i'm tired, and the belmont inn beckons. tomorrow: arab fiesta at the middle school.

      whew! what a week.  so i'm back in austin until 8 tonight. i worked last night and today. last night - slow as hell, but i averaged over 20% on tips. spent most of it today on a haircut, tomato soup, and a pastry. last night at work there was a big boom - car crash on the corner. i walked outside and all my tables were leaning over the railing to see. a few minutes later, firetrucks, cops, and ambulii. turns out it was my friend carneal, sitting at the light, when he got hit head-on by a speeding pickup, which launched off his car, crushing the windshield, flipped in the air, and landed on the other side of the road. i learned this from carneal, who was sitting at the coffee-shop when i got off work. his mom came to pick him up, she's a gabber, but he had to get the glass out of his arm. lucky guy.  S was there, she said she had "something to tell me", and she also won our staring contest. usually she loses so bad that something must be up.  been reading rilke for the first time. and george elliot. i think it was good for me to get away for a few days. i've been feeling more thoughtful and centered, maybe it has something to do with my relative solitude. sunday morning i woke up at 7:30 and went hiking in the greenbelt, ended up stripping down to my skivvies and swimming in bull creek, just below a waterfall, at about 8 am. then people started to hike by with thier dogs, so i got dressed and warmed up on a rock.  to all my portland peeps. woo-hoo! i'll see you tonight or tomorrow!

      so Cyrus has graduated, degree and all. the magnolia-lined lawn, full of parents and grandparents, family and friends, was steamy, green, and flanked by giant videoscreens. i arrived early and still secured only a modest seat, but near the processional, which mom and dad were too late to see. side note: worst commencement speech ever. at length and without novelty; some wit, a shortage of brevity. ah, but use of the word 'liminal'.  which describes, i think, the no-man's land i've been passing through lately. and to this i might add, i'm glad. because liminality has always been associated with transgression, and thus with the carnivalesque. beggars as kings, queens as whores, and merrily we go round, and all fall down. the permanent home of fluid identity, disguise, dancing, and deceit: the theater - a product of the crossroads, home of the original marketplace. trading and trust. (enough with the cliff-notes Agnew)  where else do we find the intersection of carnival and marketplace, mardi gras and quarters and dimes, than in rock and roll? this is why i am pleased to find myself in the no-man's land of someone else's liminal event, biding my time before a change of scene (perhaps small, perhaps large) absorbing all the energy of being Nowhere Really, and preparing to unleash my pent-up abandon on the small but growing record-buying public of an independent, original, and energetic band. if my nowhere really can help them get through your ear drums and into your heart, if my measured madness can push At Dusk from perfect to great, from practiced to reckless and lucky, well then perhaps i will have justified myself as more than a mere accoutrement.   on the other hand, in my personal life right now, reckless and lucky is not what i'm shooting for (would that it were so easy). finding myself unencumbered, both emotionally and actually, and having passed through the fever of obsession and freedom i set upon myself in the last year, i'm hoping i can calmly assay my desire and its potential, with a finger firmly on the pulse of my deepest passions and needs (art and creation, the closeness of physical love, my own bullheaded individuality, and the longing to become familiar with someone in the way only the passage of time can provide, among others), and reconcile what i've believed i've wanted for the longest time, with what i can live with. (if my most cherished wishes were to come true, would i be happy?) i'm thinking big, but i hope to start small. the hard part being, that i alone am a little less than half the equation...

      i feel like the last few weeks have been an asymptote leading up to my portland trip, that time has compressed - leaving me with more and more to do, more energy, and less time until my departure. i think it is reflective of my excitement, at breathing the air, at seeing my loved ones, at having good beer, at having the change of perspective i think i'm so ready for.  but here i am in Nashville, an endless parade of activities meant only to fill the vast no-man's-land of time between now and PDX. not to say it hasn't been good, but just that after that asymptote hit infinity with my departure from austin, it is strange to have this  wait  before i arrive at my destination. i've been reading rilke today, and my brother's thesis. and the combination of all that has happened and my anticipation and the things i've been exposed to (garcia-marquez, an old mix-cd, some recent blog posts, our conversations, a band ready-to-roar) has left me sleepless and drifting, the big meat-hooks of my mind finding nothing in the world to hook onto. nothing that is here in this no-man's land, at least.  on the other hand, my detachment has maybe been good for the serious family discussions we've been having. i don't really know how to say the things that Cyrus has brought up to my parents about money, stress, debt, planning the future. he's got a perspective and and an energy i used to have, when i first got back to austin, about how to help my parents out of thier hole. my energy has been absorbed by the hole, and while i'm not quite there yet, i'm approaching the 'fuck it' point. i know its not my responisibility to help them out, it's just my inclination and was once my ambition. certainly better than trying to be record producer in a town that needs more records like i need a hole in my head.

      i'm in nashville playing Contra with Cyrus, we sent the parents to the hotel about an hour ago, 'cause they were getting a little incessant with the planning talk... "when should we meet up to go to the condalezza rice talk, oh wait we're not going to that talk, um, what to do tomorrow night?" ad nauseum. tomorrow we're going out with Cy's special ladyfriend, and earlier in the day i may hear Roy Neel talk.  driving into town and to see the house that i'd seen only in pictures, where my brother's been living for the last year put me in the frame of mind i sometimes hear Berit express. it's sort of an amazed that you could ever be doing this thing / reminicising about when i did the thing. the thing being graduating, and the amazement coming chiefly from the passage of time. my brother's graduating college, and i'm still waiting tables (still? i just started.) but i have been thinking more and more about the prospect of getting a full time job. i bet i coould be pulling in $50k easy. i'd just need a reason to want all that money.   blogging's become somewhat of a ritual for me, i realize. i woke up today after my evening nap with strains of lou reed singing "you're going to reap just what you sow" in my head. had to blog, didn't blog, went to dinner. here i am.  saw  eternal sunshine  again today with the fam. the characters all got a little more annoying in the light of a second viewing. especially mary. i can't stand her character on the second time through, but the first time i liked her. and joel and clementine both got a little less magical also. (but more human) what gives?

      everything seems to be coming together. my anxiety about leaving the place to anthony has somewhat subsided since we talked last night. i'm feeling at peace with most of the things that had been topsy-turvy recently. my job, the locals, getting ready to go out of town; even cleaning my house.  had a good talk with amy last night. like, a real conversation. i think it is even the sort of thing one could relate to a thrid party in a way that would capture the content of our talk. most conversations don't make as much sense as that. and i felt so good for the rest of the evening and into today.  but a scary dream last night - culminating in the knife-beheading of my assailant. at least i won. ( dreams set in the house i grew up in... )  tomorrow i'm to finish 'tyler', or at least the guitars, with jeff and hayden. tonight i'm doing the laundry deal at the 'rents. oh how sensible my little life is.

      my days have begun to run together. i have everything to do between now and when i leave town. and i'm working tonight. and it becomes hard to remember what slightly transgressive activity was yesterday and what was the day before.   i'm trying to stay out of trouble, and get my shit together, and relax, and read my lease / find a subletter, and finish my library books, before i leave town. i also have a surprise musical project up my sleave, i hope it gets done in time to post to the blog before i hop the plane.  the leaves are still beautiful green here, but i have a feeling when i return, summer will have taken hold, with its infinite heat and the still air whispering "get the hell out of dodge!"

      so the last few days have been fast and furious. i've been working too much at that job, making me pissy and tired whenever i go in there. sunday i'm working yet another double. but enough bitching, sunday is mother's day. people are going to want the kinds of wines i don't understand. pinot gris, cab, that stuff.  last night i went to this birthday party for one of the cooks. he's 30. everyone i work with is 30. it felt like a high school party. i hardly knew anyone, so i flirted with vicky victoria who struck me as being maybe my mom's age. but then miraculously debbie arrived and met my coworkers, and kristin and i argued about the merits of going to the strip-club. some of this is rehash. well, i slept till 4:45 pm. got my 12 hours, so if i can get to sleep tonight, i should be OK for sunday.  S just taught me to cha-cha; it's all about shifting weight and counting. i think i got it. i never remember dance steps. we'll see if i can do it tomorrow.

      after work, Macallan Scotch, party with coworkers, who criticized me for going to the strip club with Debbie. exploitive!  so we went and they were closed but Debbie was consoled by a dancer who came outside to chat. then we went to her friend Shay's house. he has swords. real swords.  now i'm sleepy as a goat.

      here i am, what i wanted to write - debbie and i talked about you - she'll perhaps visit in portland. but nevertheless. epistemology vs. metaphysics.  it's a tough line to walk. bruce springsteen makes me cry sometimes. catharsis. every entry has its spin. an angle on my day. i don't know what to say anymore. i've been considering stopping blogging. it's become to shallow for me or something.   i feel like a resident of tralfalmador. always watched. it's been an experiment for me. i'm earnestly hoping for a lifestyle change. this pace is hard to keep up with, and while i usually enjoy what comes my way, i think it might be time to make something happen.   i've decided my interest in S is purely friendly, although her emotional icy-intensity is still a draw. my heart is somewhere else. (and has been for some time.) i've learned that i  could  live without the one i want, and i think that's a good realization, but why keep myself from what i long for? this feeling of being away from my heart, has lent me a certain freedom, but always with it a responsibility not to deceive people that i'm in deeper than really i am.   truth being my main interest, truth and love. and love is unlimited. the other afternoon i was sitting on my porch, and i swear i was sharing a thought with you. that had never happened to me before. but wise claire anderson (in town tonight) who's also had the electric-shock as you're falling asleep feeling, has experienced these episodes of shared thought. sometimes i hear my grandmother or my mother's voice out of nowhere, when they are not near at all. or mama dot, occasionally.

      life is full at the moment. people are crowding my apartment, hank is drunk, but it is the best use of my time since the last time i pulled an all nighter.  the beatles are bumping. lo is dancing, and althea. and debbie's birthday is today, so i think she might show.  i told conrad 'spiderhouse rules' and he didn't get it. loves movies, though.

      here i am, in the midst of it, the Rice girls have returned, and it's causing a stir in the neighborhood. matt, willy, isaac, and hayden are around, anthony calling from work - free pizza.  i don't give out free pizza at a job. it's not my way. but it is nice to have an evening off. putt-putt, finally. the sun cut hot. i lost my shirt to a sno-cone, and climbed up a pole. claire won, by a landslide.  matt asks 'are you blogging?'  yes.

      tonight was a big dig of nothing. i 'bussed' - cut bread, set tables, brought water - for the people who weren't there. i told my boss to let me go at the beginning of the shift, but instead just stood there for 5 short hours until i finally cut myself without asking. i even tried the stumptown thing again, but to no avail. the foam was too hot, i think, it all refused to pour. pourable foam. that's what i need.

      PA out of nowhere, the spiderhouse in-crowd crowding the patio, and all the sudden  evil clown rollercoaster!  beautiful brazilian circus music fille the air, played by an electronic punk band from france. i invited them up to see the dx-60 in action, but i think they have to get to Denton. i traded cd for cd.  now i'm whistling about the miner's daugher, 'Clementine' and getting ready for work. i am overworked. i am not underpaid. this can be rough.  always rumours of the restaurant's eminent demise. i don't see how it could happpen. business is booming.  money. portland. time. sublet?

      i forgot to mention a major milestone. you know the hearts they put into the foam at stumptown? well, i cracked the matrix on that foam. not a heart yet, but a respectable squiggle. i think all it will take for the heart is confidence.

      i hate losing a post. the real monday night post i was proud of, a cesspool of wit and sarcasm. initimate revelations, death and grandma.  "i do, i do." saying it twice seems to make it stronger, give it time to develop an emotional tone. i learned this from hank. when he loves someone, "with [his] heart," he'll often follow it with by repeating, "i do, i do."  i love my grandma, with my heart. i do, i do.

      last night... good dreams. we were leaving this movie. and then i picked you up and carried you like a baby, and you were so peaceful in my arms, and then all the sudden my mom was there, and i put you in her arms. and it was the most peaceful, satisfying dream feeling ever. and i hit snooze for 30 minutes just to hang onto the feeling.  and all morning i wanted to forget about S, because i shouldn't lead her on, but am i? and tomorrow Lo, Claire, Nic and Althea are coming into town...  'tis the season.

      not now, but last night i had a drinking binge, largely caused by jeff's sis, who kept buying alchohol. we even bought two bottles from the spiderhouse, even though the meanie behind the counter didn't want to sell to us.  but anyway. last night was medium fun. i hope tonight is more laid-back. trying to figure out what to do with S is next-to-impossible. she shoots down almost all my ideas. there's even a baseball game tonight in round rock, which i'd be willing to go to. we'll see. milkshake. dr. pepper.  tonight i hope to be sober and warm. and away from here. this epicenter stuff has its plusses, but right now i'm getting downright fatigued with them. suddenly, here in the courtyard are many youths i don't know. they don't seem to want to get ragingly drunk on my porch. i can relax.

       urlLink Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom   this is a book people have been asking me about. if you want to learn about wuffie, here's the place.  okokok, i decided i'm gonna post the first chapter as a teaser. you can read it here, and then go get the rest.   ======== PROLOGUE ========   I lived long enough to see the cure for death; to see the rise of the Bitchun Society, to learn ten languages; to compose three symphonies; to realize my boyhood dream of taking up residence in Disney World; to see the death of the workplace and of work.  I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keep A-Movin' Dan would decide to deadhead until the heat death of the Universe.  Dan was in his second or third blush of youth when I first met him, sometime late-XXI. He was a rangy cowpoke, apparent 25 or so, all rawhide squint-lines and sunburned neck, boots worn thin and infinitely comfortable. I was in the middle of my Chem thesis, my fourth Doctorate, and he was taking a break from Saving the World, chilling on campus in Toronto and core-dumping for some poor Anthro major. We hooked up at the Grad Students' Union -- the GSU, or Gazoo for those who knew -- on a busy Friday night, spring-ish. I was fighting a coral-slow battle for a stool at the scratched bar, inching my way closer every time the press of bodies shifted, and he had one of the few seats, surrounded by a litter of cigarette junk and empties, clearly encamped.  Some duration into my foray, he cocked his head at me and raised a sun-bleached eyebrow. "You get any closer, son, and we're going to have to get a pre-nup."  I was apparent forty or so, and I thought about bridling at being called son, but I looked into his eyes and decided that he had enough realtime that he could call me son anytime he wanted. I backed off a little and apologized.  He struck a cig and blew a pungent, strong plume over the bartender's head. "Don't worry about it. I'm probably a little over accustomed to personal space."  I couldn't remember the last time I'd heard anyone on-world talk about personal space. With the mortality rate at zero and the birth-rate at non-zero, the world was inexorably accreting a dense carpet of people, even with the migratory and deadhead drains on the population. "You've been jaunting?" I asked -- his eyes were too sharp for him to have missed an instant's experience to deadheading.  He chuckled. "No sir, not me. I'm into the kind of macho shitheadery that you only come across on-world. Jaunting's for play; I need work." The bar-glass tinkled a counterpoint.  I took a moment to conjure a HUD with his Whuffie score on it. I had to resize the window -- he had too many zeroes to fit on my standard display. I tried to act cool, but he caught the upwards flick of my eyes and then their involuntary widening. He tried a little aw-shucksery, gave it up and let a prideful grin show.  "I try not to pay it much mind. Some people, they get overly grateful." He must've seen my eyes flick up again, to pull his Whuffie history. "Wait, don't go doing that -- I'll tell you about it, you really got to know.  "Damn, you know, it's so easy to get used to life without hyperlinks. You'd think you'd really miss 'em, but you don't."  And it clicked for me. He was a missionary -- one of those fringe-dwellers who act as emissary from the Bitchun Society to the benighted corners of the world where, for whatever reasons, they want to die, starve, and choke on petrochem waste. It's amazing that these communities survive more than a generation; in the Bitchun Society proper, we usually outlive our detractors. The missionaries don't have such a high success rate -- you have to be awfully convincing to get through to a culture that's already successfully resisted nearly a century's worth of propaganda -- but when you convert a whole village, you accrue all the Whuffie they have to give. More often, missionaries end up getting refreshed from a backup after they aren't heard from for a decade or so. I'd never met one in the flesh before.  "How many successful missions have you had?" I asked.  "Figured it out, huh? I've just come off my fifth in twenty years -- counterrevolutionaries hidden out in the old Cheyenne Mountain NORAD site, still there a generation later." He sandpapered his whiskers with his fingertips. "Their parents went to ground after their life's savings vanished, and they had no use for tech any more advanced than a rifle. Plenty of those, though."  He spun a fascinating yarn then, how he slowly gained the acceptance of the mountain-dwellers, and then their trust, and then betrayed it in subtle, beneficent ways: introducing Free Energy to their greenhouses, then a gengineered crop or two, then curing a couple deaths, slowly inching them toward the Bitchun Society, until they couldn't remember why they hadn't wanted to be a part of it from the start. Now they were mostly off-world, exploring toy frontiers with unlimited energy and unlimited supplies and deadheading through the dull times en route.  "I guess it'd be too much of a shock for them to stay on-world. They think of us as the enemy, you know -- they had all kinds of plans drawn up for when we invaded them and took them away; hollow suicide teeth, booby-traps, fall-back-and-rendezvous points for the survivors. They just can't get over hating us, even though we don't even know they exist. Off-world, they can pretend that they're still living rough and hard." He rubbed his chin again, his hard calluses grating over his whiskers. "But for me, the real rough life is right here, on-world. The little enclaves, each one is like an alternate history of humanity -- what if we'd taken the Free Energy, but not deadheading? What if we'd taken deadheading, but only for the critically ill, not for people who didn't want to be bored on long bus-rides? Or no hyperlinks, no ad-hocracy, no Whuffie? Each one is different and wonderful."  I have a stupid habit of arguing for the sake of, and I found myself saying, "Wonderful? Oh sure, nothing finer than, oh, let's see, dying, starving, freezing, broiling, killing, cruelty and ignorance and pain and misery. I know I sure miss it."  Keep A-Movin' Dan snorted. "You think a junkie misses sobriety?"  I knocked on the bar. "Hello! There aren't any junkies anymore!"  He struck another cig. "But you know what a junkie _is_, right? Junkies don't miss sobriety, because they don't remember how sharp everything was, how the pain made the joy sweeter. We can't remember what it was like to work to earn our keep; to worry that there might not be _enough_, that we might get sick or get hit by a bus. We don't remember what it was like to take chances, and we sure as shit don't remember what it felt like to have them pay off."  He had a point. Here I was, only in my second or third adulthood, and already ready to toss it all in and do something, _anything_, else. He had a point -- but I wasn't about to admit it. "So you say. I say, I take a chance when I strike up a conversation in a bar, when I fall in love. . . And what about the deadheads? Two people I know, they just went deadhead for ten thousand years! Tell me that's not taking a chance!" Truth be told, almost everyone I'd known in my eighty-some years were deadheading or jaunting or just _gone_. Lonely days, then.  "Brother, that's committing half-assed suicide. The way we're going, they'll be lucky if someone doesn't just switch 'em off when it comes time to reanimate. In case you haven't noticed, it's getting a little crowded around here."  I made pish-tosh sounds and wiped off my forehead with a bar-napkin -- the Gazoo was beastly hot on summer nights. "Uh-huh, just like the world was getting a little crowded a hundred years ago, before Free Energy. Like it was getting too greenhousey, too nukey, too hot or too cold. We fixed it then, we'll fix it again when the time comes. I'm gonna be here in ten thousand years, you damn betcha, but I think I'll do it the long way around."  He cocked his head again, and gave it some thought. If it had been any of the other grad students, I'd have assumed he was grepping for some bolstering factoids to support his next sally. But with him, I just knew he was thinking about it, the old-fashioned way.  "I think that if I'm still here in ten thousand years, I'm going to be crazy as hell. Ten thousand years, pal! Ten thousand years ago, the state-of-the-art was a goat. You really think you're going to be anything recognizably human in a hundred centuries? Me, I'm not interested in being a post-person. I'm going to wake up one day, and I'm going to say, 'Well, I guess I've seen about enough,' and that'll be my last day."  I had seen where he was going with this, and I had stopped paying attention while I readied my response. I probably should have paid more attention. "But why? Why not just deadhead for a few centuries, see if there's anything that takes your fancy, and if not, back to sleep for a few more? Why do anything so _final_?"  He embarrassed me by making a show of thinking it over again, making me feel like I was just a half-pissed glib poltroon. "I suppose it's because nothing else is. I've always known that someday, I was going to stop moving, stop seeking, stop kicking, and have done with it. There'll come a day when I don't have anything left to do, except stop."

       urlLink cuteness.  welcome debz! it's good to have you around. and the rest of oh sarah!'s site is nice, too.  i'm here at the same kitchen table desk, tapping away on mom's mac. maybe alyssa didn't leave my toothpaste behind - it could have been in her pocket. the toothpaste on the bed looked like mine, but now i have two travel tubes - it seems improbable that i would.  green is everything outside the window. must be due to this rain we've been having. i hope it lets up, the mold is making my eyes into tiny whale eyes.   i bought some things today at Breed & Co., the hardware store down the street from my house. it's fun to go in there, like i did when i was a kid, and when the helpful salesman asks if you need any help, surprise him and say yes. and lightbulbs, too.   steak for dinner - mild fear of mad cow. i've been on a paranoid germ streak lately. maybe that's the cause of my allergies.

      tonight: exhausting. went to the pub with hayden after work (and cooking dinner - mashers and leftover veggies and tempeh.) met up with anthony and hank after work, then panika and her friend dropped by looking for a place to crash. next, alyssa and sunny, also looking for a place to crash. i gave the latter some bread, and sunny was into  heights  big time. he left with a copy of  sopk . she nearly left with my toothpaste.  now i'm winding down, gonna have tea in ten minutes, read conrad and sleep.  the prospect of working on music with amy has me bathed in possibilities. but we can't do everything, although we could do anything. lake vs rhythm beds. botanical gardens or stay up all night. energy, and how to spend it.  a phrase that doesn't come up on google: "breakbeat pansy"

      poisonous snakes. just got back from a jog, down by the creek. saw Scott from work on the way - don't know why he was walking to work so early. so i took a right to avoid his work ethic meeting my leisure. down by the creek, the place i usually cross was flooded over from the rain. so i scrambled through bushes and over rocks (maybe its the conrad) to find another place to fjord. at the last outcropping, i hopped onto this rock, and to my surprise a big water moccasin slithered off and into the water. glad he was scared of me, but not too scared.  so i turned back and scrambled the rocks again and crossed at the old place, wetting my shoes. and ran all the way home.

      so last night i went  ruta's shindig, and made a just great audioblog about it on the walk home. but i hit red instead of # 1, and my recording went to nowhere land.   i just got back from bartending at the granite. the same lady from last week came in and got the same thing sitting at the bar. and two other ladies talked about "farenheit 911" and i poured a few things or other. it was slow. so slow. and i strained orange juice - and made lemonaide.   but that's not what i came here to tell you about. i'm here to tell you about dancing. i danced last night -- i did air guitar to the white stripes, and sung raspberry beret, and phreaked out to "superstitious." and tonight who knows what's going to happen aside from a hot hot hott bath, to soak out my still-sore-from-jogging-yesterday muscles. maybe tonight i'll party w/o drinking.

      Pixies, Modest Mouse to Play Austin City Limits Fest Palm Elementary Choir to tear the roof off with unexpected "Music Is Fun" encore  Eric Marth reports: You've seen Billy Bragg, Wilco, Ben Kweller, Jonny Lang, Beck, Spoon, and dozens (maybe hundreds?) of others grace the stage on PBS's long-running TV series, Austin City Limits. Now, dozens (pretty fucking close to hundreds, actually) of truly excellent bands have signed on to perform at this summer's Austin City Limits Festival. It's like, synergy, man.  The only details released so far are the dates and the bands, but among the mob of festival-confirmed artists are The Beta Band, Cat Power, Neko Case, The Pixies, Wilco, and Spoon. Oh shit, and also, Broken Social Scene, Modest Mouse, My Morning Jacket, Calexico and Centro-Matic. Oops-- don't forget American Analog Set, Franz Ferdinand, and... oh, just read the damn list for yourself. Set to run from September 17th through the 19th at Zilker Park in Austin, Texas, the ACLF is pretty much a guaranteed combination in quality and quantity. It's a veritable 69 Love Songs of a festival: too long, too eclectic, too hott. Here, in convenient alphabetical-type style, is the list of bands scheduled to perform:  American Analog Set Terry Allen Trey Anastasio Anthropos Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra Asleep at the Wheel Marcia Ball Bobby Bare, Jr. The Bells of Joy The Beta Band Big Head Todd & The Monsters The Biscuit Brothers The Blind Boys of Alabama Broken Social Scene Doyle Bramhall Marc Broussard Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown Solomon Burke The John Butler Trio Cake Calexico Cat Power Troy Campbell Neko Case Centro-Matic Cooper's Uncle Sheryl Crow Kacy Crowley Dashboard Confessional Howie Day Deadman The Dirty Dozen Brass Band Drive-By Truckers The Durdens Electric Church Joe Ely Endochine Franz Ferdinand Guy Forsyth Donavon Frankenreiter David Garza The Gospelaires The Gourds The Greencards G.

      i got up this morning and jogged. it made me SO TIRED i went back to sleep when i got home. i love  heart of darkness  but it makes me sleepy.   today was devoid of entertaining anecdotes, but i will say this, "MGUMGUGMMGUMGMG." which is the sound of munching an eewie gooey brownie with cheesecake parts. i did a lot of that, and i ate a bunch of other stuff today, too. maybe the running made me hungry. and last night i learned that talking about web design can be as hott as almost anything you can do on the phone.  "less than" "greater than" "ampersand"  "ooooh, ampersand!"

      i went back through my archives today, worried that a week is too short a time. i looked to see what happened to me a week ago. i went to the mall. that seems liks a Long Time Ago. i'm glad that that seems so long ago. it means a week can be a long time. a long week is what i want, but not just yet, first i want the rest of this week to be of regular length.  i was in bed, reading Jospeh Conrad (secret: i've never read  heart of darkness ) from my mom's old college copy, when Elliott called me and said "what are you up to?" and i said "reading Conrad." so he's gonna drop by in a minute, which ought to be fun, 'cause i'm feeling relaxed on account of the Easy Now tea i drank earlier. my tounge got burnt. i think i deserved it for being mean to Claire in my earlier post. i love you, Claire, even when you peer pressure me to blog.  tomorrow i work in the evening. my morning plans include excersize. my after work plans include Ruta's party. i wonder what Amy's doing tonight. will she call? will we have anything to talk about? we never know 'till we try it.

      so things were going pretty good. i'm down at The Table with S and Carneal, an Hankwas here eating the yogurt i brought him, when blonde meanie #1 (coffee serf) came out the back door to have a cigarette. he said, "Hank." like that was all he had to say. Hank says "I'm not drinking, I'm just sitting with my friends, eating yogurt."   "Leave." so he did, and now S, Carneal and I are talking shit to each other and feeling like our peaceful reverie has been interrupted.   today i made as much money as i just spent at the grocery store. but i've got provisions. so i'll eat good tomorrow morning. canteloupe, cottage cheese, and garlic stuffed olives.   now were talking about greg's hypothetical cottage cheese, cauliflower, and mash potato burrito. and dan quayle.   happy, claire?

      last night as conversation with my special ladyfriend was winding down. i heard a ker-thunk outside somewhere. not sure what it was (sounded like a rumble), i was pretty sure it was a harbinger of dischord in my immediate area. sure 'nuff, within 5 minutes, anthony was pounding on the door. within 10, hank was using my bathroom. turns out he'd fallen down my stairs.  i call it the 3am psych-out. as in "psyched ya out that you were gonna get to go to sleep in peace. boo ya!" the 3-am psych-out is as reliable around here as smog in LA, but still hasn't lost its power to surprise. "boo ya!"   i learned a new trick: using the power of bathrobe as signifier. (if you open the door in your robe, people are less likely to assume that now is the best time to offer you a beer / joint / bright light.  i'm up early, thanks the psych-out's cousin: the 7am dumpster service. what am i doing?

      i was almost late for work today because i was eating pizza and reading outside of wheatsville coop. but i got there and got paid, so now i'm happy. looks like the rent is gonna come through this month.  right now i'm trying to figure out the particulars and practicalities of returning to portland, a place i only kinda sorta left at all. I want my stumptown coffee!   i've been on edge all evening b/c i wasn't feeling so social, and everything was loud - with a band playing and shit like that, and S and Hank wanting to hang out, which is nice, but i wasn't up for it, and i drank too much mate tea today, so my nerves were up, and then hank had bad news for me, and now i'm feeling a little shaken.  at least i have organic carrots and free nighttime minutes.

      night falls over the city. i've been at work for a few hours, nothing much has happened. a few frozens, some wine. suddenly jeff, his sister christine, and anthony (all dressed up in disguise) come in and sit at the bar -- at the same time, orders ring in for two martinis (one belvedere and one beefeater, both dry with an olive.) i scan the ticket, and pour two belvederes, feeling great.   enter: sarah #1. "these are both the same?" sarah #2: "lemme see that. no, i can  really  see how those would look the same." we all agree that the ticket would make you think so (so many drinks are the same). ignorant to the proceedings, ebullient and boisterous, jeff harangues me about my job: "wow! i've never seen you look so clean cut." the thought slices through my mind, that i dress like this every day. the same?   one vodka, one gin. i remake the martinis whilst simultaneous orders fly in for cosmos, wine, and oddly, no beer at all tonight. i'm weeded. jeff keeps talking so i tell him to shut up. sarah #2 gets her own frozen, and stacy lynne (you have to call her by both) grabs her saffire and tonic without my even noticing. i'm pouring palliser (luckily one of those newfangled screw tops, which actually keeps the wine freshher) and maybe some saintsbury garnet.   soon it's over, but the kids hang for a while. it's fun when friends come in. i break anthony's hundred, or rather have miranda do it. i've got to take a math test before they will give me my own drawer. after the kids leave, the night - slow.  more: cut, i left the building, calling cary on the phone. he'd call back. and then i remembered i'd forgotten to clock out, so i called and clocked out, inconveniencing miranda. went home, talked to cary. hung with hank on the porch. things were quiet. checked my pockets... miranda's office keys! fuck me. i put my shoes back on and hightail it back to the restaurant circa 10:30, talking with Cary on the way. had to put him on hold while i went in and returned the keys.  it looks like at dusk has a good opportunity lined up in austin, incompatible with the rest of the tour schedule. could use better coordination. central database web accessible. can you webshare from iCal? alternatively, gimme 3hrs on filemaker. diy.  i keep looking at this sexy picture on my desktop. i can't quite see her, but neither can you, it's password-protected. if only i had f11.   heights , completed but inaccessible, tickle my neurons.   anthony and i found a bunch of polaroid photos down in the creek behind ego's on congress -- scattered, some muddy. italian bike contests and cathedrals, some people, including a hipster girl everyone seemed to recognize. anthony asked around at bars "do you recognize this girl?" we were directed to T-1 biker team / bikeshop, which consists of the austinites pictured doing 360&deg;s in italy. mystery almost solved, but the pictures still sit here in my apartment, waiting to be returned. i might appropriate them. anthony: private-eye. me: pirate.

      ...when you've been drinking.  i spent the morning bar-hopping with anthony, hooking up at dusk gigs. the hole in the wall on the sunday the 25th, and now it's looking like punk rock BBQ on the 24th at Trophy's - a fine place to play, and great for promoting the next night's show.  tha apartment is still relatively clean, and i go into work tonight, making mostly martinis and frozens. i think i have time to sober up beforehand, as well as shower. it's been good to get out of the house. here's to making bank tonight.

      I traversed stairs with matresses. I've only taken bath's alone for awhile. I'm experimenting with capitalization. There's a prayer-rug in the middle of my apartment. I'm so fresh and so clean.  Tried to watch Lawrence Olivier's  King Lear  yesterday; multitasking, I attempted to sleep. I had to turn off the movie half-way through. All yelling and no cinematography.  Amy K - all night conversation. makes me glow inside.  Dinner with mom & dad last night, booked At Dusk tonight. Do you guys want Sun the 25th, or Tues the 27th? Anthony recommends Sunday.  Had a major freak-out jam session tonight. Hayden on drum machine, me on lazer - all from the same bass amp. wicked beats. I think I might have found my instrument.  grampz@gmail.com or jchris at gmail? vote with your messages. i'm also running a test here, the exposed address grampz@gmail.com will get caught by spiders, how well do the spam filters react?

      been around town with mom today. went to central market, the gap, tarrytown pharmacy (childhood haunt), and The Mall. the same Mall where i went with Marinda towards the end of my freshman year in high school. the same mall where banana republic used to have a real khaki jeep in the window. now they have a kiosk where you can get your photo engraved on a piece of metal. and the doors are automatically sliding. me and mom both entered the contest to win a $500 shopping spree, blithely ignoring the "one entry per family" rule.  now i'm at the 'rents, drinking a  spicy martini . i say it is spicy because it is. and in contains one olive of type "habañero stuffed." mom's excited that amy is coming to visit, but not as excited as I am. i just bit into the aformentioned olive, and now i think i need medical attention. hot. woooo! endorphins.  that is all.

      i'm a little sticky from when this guy jo dropped his canned malt liquor and it burst and sprayed me. my nose tells me there's a mildew problem in my apartment - i'm gonna tear the room apart, find the cure. i ate the last viable food in the place (toast with artichoke hearts and mayo.)  what do all these things have in common? not sure, but tomorrow i'll be getting some things done. i've finished the talking heads book; next up - bulk granola, soy milk.  i'm in that mood today where i don't appreciate the prescient things people say. i don't want to be known, and when people see through me, it's vicious. at other times i want to be known - isn't that the essence of communication? but today hank kept saying nearly true things about me. i appreciate his insight and intuition, as qualities, but when someone can tell you things about yourself you don't even want to know... you figure out ways to change the subject.   maybe it's a wake-up call that i've had my head in the sand. i think  waiting  will not long be my main activity. i'm still trying to formulate and understand my updated set of desires. what do i want now that i've got what i want?   i sleep, read, blog, talk, listen, think, smile, work, work, joke, eat, shower, sit. i even create. collaborate. but i don't strive. i've had months and months at a time, where all my eating, sleeping, working, creating, and collaborating are strivings for a goal. for something i need.   i guess i need focus. the urge for a quieter, more focused life continues.

      Sometimes that's the whole trick, is hearing the difference between pretty good and great. Between lousy and good is easy, anybody can do that. But good and great can be a fine line, and it can be hard to distinguish if you're new at this. That's essentially what we're talking about here, the difference between good and great. And people say to me, "I want it perfect." But to me perfect is boring. We can try to make it great, but perfect is boring. - Shelly Yakus, TapeOp No. 31

      i've been looking closer at small things, i think. i spent half the day half-naked on the floor, drawing and photographing things- myself, the art on the walls. a remix concept for paintings: my digi cam takes quick series 16 shot grid pictures. if i try to move the camera just so that the art i'm photographing comes out least distorted, it never works. if i just don't care, sometimes i get wonderful results. i took a lot of pictures of me in the bathtub also. kissing a light bulb. with a stuffed bunny in the other hand. the light in the bathroom is unbeatable.  also - dinner at grandma's. we made portabello sandwiches and hung out. talked about portland, talked about relations. grandma is among the few people i know that don't require my making a great effort to be understood. i think we were both a little sleepy.  - new template... yeah i know. i just got sick of the old one. too much to keep track of. too many changes, like layers in the fossil record. plus the new template bandwagon is revving up. and i'm jealous of the "previous posts" section. and sick of my music crashing the free computers at schlotsky's.  more news - hank has a blog now. the first post barely exists, but i'm sure it will grow in time.  urlLink West 29th Street Blues

      or urine. no seriously i've been reading inspirational literature lately. ahh, the power of compound interest. i'm a miser. i go to the bank almost every day - to deposit my tips. i think this is a lifestyle change, not just a strategy for getting enough $$ to get to portland. i've discovered that if i'm smart with my money, i can live and retire comfortably without ever having to get a job that demands things of me that i don't want to give. or i can even have the super-sporadic income of a fledgling record producer. and still live comfortably.   right now i have like $200 saved up. this is more than i've ever intentionally saved. i've never saved before.  in other news, i'm putting out an APB on living space in PDX. for those of you with eyes in the right place, here's where i;d love to live: someplace that is cheap and can double as a no-hassle recording space. i'm thinking someplace in the warehouse district down by Division and 99E or therabouts. any leads, let me know.

      having experienced the way life can make sense for awhile, up in portland, things around here seem a little unreal. i spent the day on the couch, reading about the talking heads. later ruta and hank stopped by and we all sat and read. now i'm at the parent's house with grandma and cyrus, hoping to hear 'tired eyes' in a better context. and here it is...  listen through the mdr-7506's off the iMac, and i can hear music in there. in fact, it doesn't sound so bad. how can sony allow such bad d/a convertors on its vaio "multimedia" laptops? really, the difference is phenomenal. coming out of nero player on the PC, vs iTunes here, ahhh. mostly it sounds like i bypassed the SuperGrunge stompbox that used to live between the song and my ears.  still, i think this song is among the most challenging mixes i've had on my plate, which is part of why i saved it for later, so that i could give it the attention it deserves - a plan which backfired - but at least i got the other songs mixed, which might not have happened had i got wrapped up in unwater.   although rolling off the lows on greg's original guitar, setting the piano where it belongs in the mix, and dropping the bass a little should help, i wish i had had more time for philosophizing before jumping into the mix - what are the elements here, what's close? what's far away? hopefully you at duskers will meet with success in the tweaking sessions.   as far as the mastering goes, it sounds just fine, considering the mix. i can't wait to hear one of the other tracks mastered!  work, save, sleep, read. work, save, sleep, read. if that were all i had i would be ok with waiting. but i have the urge to create, and not quite the possibility. been trying to get jeff's songs ready to work on for ages, but no computer. frustrating. last night i told him about the move to portland. he got all upset, but seemed happier today when he found out that as long as he's in texas, tuition for him is free. go army.

      i got to work at 9:38 today. just a little late, although it could have been worse, 'cause anthony passed out on my porch last night with my phone/alarm in his hand. i just happened to wake up on time.  free weekend minutes, my ass. i worked for 5 hours, and came home for a couple, and went back. the first shift: gay party. good tippers. fundraiser for the fag lobby. it's a good cause, and i made good money. gay guys all seem to make the same jokes about how they want me. "you mean, we ask for something, and you bring it?" "yeah, but if it's not on the menu, you'll have no idea what to expect."  got home. listened to prospective masters of 'tired eyes'. no bones. need to remix.   back to work - just a sunday night. waited on the owners, my parents came in. made $80. then dad helped me close the restaurant, and now i'm home, contemplating 'tired eyes' again.

      today work was fine, a little long, but i made $50, and had a good time chatting with lauren the busser, who's bf is having a record release party tomorrow. walking home from work i got a call from my dad, who had to tell me that a) S and friend were cute and b) my rental company called bearing a complaint from the landlord about the people i associate with and their conduct. rough and tumble. perhaps the only recourse is to enforce a no beer on the porch rule. maybe then people won't hang out so much. also i guess conrad has a restraining order against hank, which makes him upset that we are friends. whatev. but the right response is the one that keeps me my deposit. i guess i should talk to conrad.  last night i spent at carneal's with S and elliott and catherine and elliot's friend katie. well some of them left early, but i still got to work on time. that S. always having something get her down. it makes me want to take her under my wing and give her the happiness that she deserves, but she may be immune to it. i try not to play to her expectations, b/c i think she's learned how to turn her woundedness into a font of attention. it's not my place or ability to "fix" people, but i can tell she's got a good heart and plenty to enjoy about life, if she could. and she does, but still. so it goes.  the eerily accurate horoscope book describes 2004 as being a good year for me and money, and september as a good month for love and marriage. marriage might be a little much, (although you never know) but love can't be beat. and career success is supposed to be mine over the next seven years (my sun is in a new house for only the second time in my life - 11 year cycles.) i don't know about you but i  totally  buy into that horoscope crap. like a tech-IPO. like hotcakes. like a beach house with satallite tv. like tickle-me-elmo futures.  this summer is also supposed to be a good time for me to get into something new. like moving to portland. oh did i mention? that isaac and 'tane are moving to seattle, and anthony there maybe in february. i like the idea. some don't.

      One sort an angel did direct, A star did guide the other, And all the fairest son to see That ever had a mother. Sing lullaby, my little boy, Sing, lullaby, my lives joy.  When I him in mine arms embrace, I feel my heart embraced,  Even by the inward grace of his. Which he in me hath planted. Sing lullaby, my little boy, Sing, lullaby, my lives joy.  And when I kiss his loving lips, Then his sweet-smelling breath Doth yield a savour to my soul, That feeds love, hope, and faith. Sing lullaby, my little boy, Sing, lullaby, my lives joy.  When thou hast taken thy repast, Repose, my babe, on me. So may thy mother and thy nurse, The cradle also be. Sing lullaby, my little boy, Sing, lullaby, my lives joy.  Grow up, good fruit be nourished by These fountains two of me, That only flow with maiden's milk, The only meat for thee. Sing lullaby, my little boy, Sing, lullaby, my lives joy.  Live still with me, and be my love, And death will me refrain, Unless thou let me die with thee, To live with thee again. Sing lullaby, my little boy, Sing, lullaby, my lives joy.    Can you pick the one word I changed in this poem by Richard Rowlands? (i also only used a few verses, and changed their order.)  i think it would be fun to arrange this into a song, provided you didn't try to make too much sense of it.  been without computer for a few hours, had blog backing up in my brain.  read some  Illusions of the Post-Modern  last night. an enjoyable argument, especially cause he agrees with me, i think, about the left being captains of their own disempowerment. "damn the man. rock the margins." not the vote.  blarney. time to get more things done.

      the heat, the canned cool, the fam. back in austin and trying to tune it all out. mom's giving all the furniture to my brother, which is fine, (what use do i have for it?), but it will be strange to see both rooms i usually occupy when i visit, empty of couch, dresser, bed. they are all going to nashville.   i, on the other hand, am going to work, where i will be warmly received, or not, you never can tell. money, that's what i want. i've got a use for it. a reason to accumulate. also, my brother has been extolling to me the virtues of compound interest. so perhaps now it is time for me to begin to save, for that day in the future when i have so much saved i don't have to accumulate any more.  in light of my newly requited love, i've been beginning to reevaluate my interest in some of the local fauna. my attraction to these girls, even when reciprocated, is about as rewarding as a rob schneider film. that is, it don't stick, while it may be fun at the time. perhaps there's some measure of what you have to go through to win someone's heart - showing dedication there may be indicative of future dedication. or maybe not, but winning hearts has not been my interest here in texas in a long time. and my dedication to the hook-up is beginning to wane.

      i'm the one with the boom.  i'm reading the kerry blogs tonight - the liberals need to stop pussyfooting around, but at the same time, we need to understand that John Kerry  gets it  - in the way it seems you can tell with Clinton, that he gets it. It's a humanizing factor, but then again, John Kerry's robotic motion reminds me of the few undecideds i've met. "aww, i dunno how i'm gonna vote, probably just for whoever seems to be winning," is the attitude i've witnessed in the field. the most extreme political apathy i've ever seen on the canvas nearly made me cry. undecided? really?  this is a chance to see the two-party struggle in full effect. i believe there should always be a prime number of parties in the running, to avoid factions. probably five serious parties would be best. fringe left / left / fringe center / right / right-wing wackos. give those undecideds a party.  eric's been talking about a communication party, which would be a voice for the underground-- always made of coalitions, just to get the word out into the discourse.  i can't see where he stands on economic policy, but i can see how he fits. wuffie. local wuffie for running a free bookstore. i'm leaving my couch out tonight, car tomorrow.    this is my last night in the partment. next - nowhere really. for sometime, then up in the air, and back to portland. hat's in the drawing room.

      dreamed last night about putting my hand in this girl's pants, like that's a real significant move or something. and also in the dream i think it was Sam I am who started to do the same thing to me. and there where other moves, too. not like that, more like cartwheels. i dreamed about my one-handed handstands, and felt out of shape, but sure was keeping on doing 'em. i also said soemthing about Ben Caccione's feelings about belly-buttons, without actually thinking about Ben Caccione. and played darts with a girl who reminded me of Jeff's sister but was not. and i talked to Amy on the phone a lot in this dream, which was nice, cause we've not had the time, lately.  making moves  mostly, i've got to take this little apartment i've got and empty it. today i should reach for that goal by putting everything that's going to portland in one corner, and everything that is not in another. i think i'm trepidatious about my "party." shall i try to keep it small? i'm a crazy-man. the party actually shouldn't be too disruptive, as long as i don't get too fucked up. (and why should i?) alls i need to do is get hold of the mom mobile for saturday. somehow. time to plan.  making sitting there  last night contained the unexpected double feature (after  I, Robot  we got treated to a sneak preview of  The Village  which was mostly saved by the performance of Bryce Dallas Howard, and the fact that i though William Hurt was Jeff Bridges the whole time.)

      i cashed in the free dinner card Miranda gave me for some Cascabel Crusted Tuna. you'd think the "signature dish" at celebrity chef Sam Dickey's restaurant would really be  the shit , but not exactly, no. i've never had the Tuna before, despite pushing it like gangbusters. maybe there's a reason they say "anything but the tuna" for training meals. it was a little dry, without much flavor of it's own, even cooked medium-rare. ok, so the cascabel pepper crust was a delight to the mouth, and the fried green tomatoes can't be beat, but the tuna. hrgmph.  you can't begin to conceptualize how much beer we drank last night. the Hole gave the guys a $50 bar tab to dispose of, so we sat in a powwow on the empty stage and drank pitcher upon $5.50 pitcher of the stuff. thanks, Hole in the Wall. miraculously, no hangover. afterward we were sucked into York's invite to the 21st St co-op. lame lame lame it was. after begging us to go, we saw neither hide nor hair of York at all. and there was really nothing to do but get beat at chess by Erica while Will played rush songs on the acoustic guitar. afterwards, Kerby, and then to bed at 6 am.

      i'm surfing on sleeplessness and caffeine. the aleve aleviated my headache, but my word part of my brain is a little broken. hanging with the dudes has been nice - it's good to get a little non-austin action, and specifically, PDX action, here before i leave. Greg wanted to know if my housing plans for portland had been vetted by Amy and Lindsay. Cary pointed out that i live in a tree house, "Swiss-spider Anderson". Will did jumping-jacks upstairs while we drank coffee.   we're about to head down to the Hole to check on load in and where to park the (gargantuan) van.  executive.

      ran into Kit at the Deep Eddy cabaret. she's one of the people from High School i most wished i'd kept in touch with, and it we had a good time catching up. she's been around Austin and is still friends with a lot of the old crew, so i hope i'll get to see some others before i go. for a long time i had a scar from playing thumb war with Callie, who will be back in a week or so. and Kit's also friends with Suzie, who Jeff's still got a crush on after all these years. Kit and I used to wrestle in the parking lot. she also told me that one of my ex-girlfriends is a lesbian now. that makes me feel a lot better about her not wanting to kiss me at that movie in 9th grade.  i was beating Jeff at chess - not usually something i do, although i did win a game the other night - but i lost focus in the end game and let him win.  i only got to talk to Amy for like 7 minutes last night. she seemed worn-out, which makes sense, seeing how busy she's been and now Amanda's in town and i like pictures but there's none of my woman. that's alright cause when we talk all night it's hard to remember everything we say, but i know for sure we talked about Starsky and Hutch and how Lindsay's gonna beat me up. when i get to PDX it'll be nice not to talk at all.

      i sent two boxes of clothes to pdx yesterday, i have a box of books to follow. the guy at PakMail told me fed ex would deliver to the house, but the post office might not, so i sent 'em fed ex for $3 more. grand total of $65.   lunch today was busy enough that it paid for that. thank god. work was getting old. i came up with a koan: "work is easier when it's hard."  i've been fucking masticated by mosquitoes in the last five minutes. WTF. ah yes, dusk.  speaking of - Tuesday and i got them a decently prominent listing in the paper. still trying to put together an opener.  been reading hps-online.com and apparently i shouldn't be about to eat these hashbrowns and eggs. at least they are free range, right?  ps. my phone should come back on soon.

      "What are you really talking about? What do you mean by 'eradicating craving'?" Achaan Chaa looked down and smiled faintly. He picked up the glass of drinking water to his left. Holding it up to us, he spoke in the chirpy Lao dialect that was his native tounge: "You see the goblet? For me, this glass is already broken. I enjoy it; I drink out of it. It holds my water admirably, sometimes even reflecting the sun in beautiful patterns. If I should tap it, it has a lovely ring to it. But when I put this glass on a shelf and the wind knocks it over or my elbow brushes it off the table and it falls to the ground and shatters, I say, 'Of course.' But when I understand that this glass is already broken, every moment with it is precious." Achaan Chaa was not just talking about the glass, of course, nor was he speaking merely of the phenomenal world, the forest monestary, the body, or the inevitability of death. He was speaking to each of us about the self. This self that you take to be so real, he was saying, is already broken.  from  Thoughts Without a Thinker

      seems like people are falling off that blogwagon. someday maybe i'll be the only one left... (see the teardrop fall)  today i gave buzz a ride home after work. he makes no secret about wanting to fuck me. "c'mon, try it, you're leaving town anyway... why not?" i try not to tease him too bad, but if i was gonna a fuck a guy, it wouldn't be buzz (he's like 40). yet somehow, amidst all the sexual harrasment, he still manages to be one of my favorite people at work. maybe it's the flattery, maybe i'm not that shallow...  saying good bye to austin - spent the afternoon participating in S and Racheal's boredom. somehow i upset S - not sure, i guess she didn't take well to my friendly jabs. her boyfriend is like 100 miles away, and this weighs heavily on her; my woman is quite a bit further, but it doesn't feel like distance to me, only time. maybe it's my age and experience, or maybe it is because Amy's and my relationship has done a lot of its growth under those circumstances, but the distance/time doesn't upset me much, it just seems to be the way things are.   i think one of the things that helps me relate to S is that i can see in her, some of myself at her age. things seemed so much bigger then - in a week the whole world could change, and no one could tell but me. all in all, i'm glad i've stabilized, that i've grown weathered to the storm, so that small dramas don't capture me the way they did. unfortunately, i can be insensitive to the way the people i know are effected by the little things. not that i don't see it but that i don't care. i want to "toughen them up," i guess. but i should not assume that they'll see the humor i put into what i say and do. i guess i don't always make it obvious.  anecdote: i once had a girlfriend who would fish for compliments by complaining that she was fat (actually, i've had a few like that). the complaint goes something like this -in whiny singsong: "i'm faaaaat." i suppose my expected duty was to respond by contradicting her and pointing out her bony wrists or what have you. after a while i got fed up with that game, and instead responded, "yeah, you really are fat, maybe it's time to start exercising." she didn't take well to that at all. perhaps it was mean of me to do, but the meanness came from my expression of fed-up-ness, and not from insulting her figure.  i hope i never tell that story again.

      when i was but a little tyke, my dad officed (a verb they didn't much use back then - he had an office) downtown. well, they were gonna build an even bigger skyscraper next door, but when they dug the big hole like they usually do, they discovered Mammoth Bones. Wooly Mammoth Bones, yeah. so i got to use my dad's telescope in the big window of his office for more than just checking out pedestrians on the lunch hour. i got to look at Mammoth bones being dug up. huge. now they are in the natural history museum at U.T.  reason i bring this up is 'cause the size of dig it is. its about the same size as the dig i've got going over there and to the bottom left. yeah. Amazon links. but, I get to pick the books, except for the bottom one, so i guess it's sorta like instead of citing the things i plagerize from i'll just try to sell them.

      he looked inside, and found nothing. and lost himself, and god came in. and then it passed, and there he was, he had only lost himself for a moment. but a little was still missing. he'd thought, at the time, "i don't exist" and it had made sense. but now he thought, i've found myself again. but some would be gone forever. could he, with practice, dream his soul away, piece by piece, until he was gone for good? what would it be like, for him, in that state? everything else would be him, and his insides gone. pure being, immediate, unchecked by boundaries between the self and world. without a self, always, impossible? or is it without a world? what is it to lose track of / see through that boundary? saeculi saeculorum.

      we just got off the phone, and i feel just great. usually, we'll talk 'till we're through, and then keep on talking, trailing off into ramblings and chatter. but tonight we caught ourselves, and i hung up feeling satisfied and ready to return to the unmediated world. satisfied from the best phone sex i've ever had (yeah) - i didn't know it could be on a par with the real thing. "mindsex, baby, mindsex." but satisfied also from the revealing and dare i say deep conversation we had in the ealier hours. (we only talked for three, can you believe it?) about things like the roots of independence, past loves, and would you want to keep a mongloid baby?     but the best thing you learn in getting close to someone is not the answers they have to those sorts of questions, their feelings on tough topics and thier earliest memories. while those are important parts of her makeup, what's more important is learning how to learn about the one you love. how to be quiet when she has something to say, and how sometimes that something will become something more, if you can hold to your quietness and listen.    and we talked of my tummyache and of her professor, and of girlfriend's girlfriends. and friend's newly regendered boyfriends. and parties and not going to parties and talking instead. and chatter. and  urlLink shepard tones .

      one part i forgot to blog earlier on the production topic. it seems like 90% of the work i've done as a record maker involves getting the band in the room for the session. once that happens, all you have to do is not fuck up. hit record, hope playback works. if they play a keeper, you've got it.    got back from brandon and evan's new housewarming party tonight, saw andy bruno and cozmena. and some monkeys. and a tiki. then to hayden's for the after-party. i was too much fun for the party party. got some attention by singing along with gusto, then rode with sarah to the h-zone. she has a "thing" for hayden.    now i'm eating canned beets and stoufers skillet sensations. i'm still sore from the massage jeff gave me. we're supposed to watch a video tomorrow for lunch. leonard bernstein.

      so i've got this book about record producers, its full of interviews and profiles of 500 of the most well-known ones. well, alot of what they talk about is how they go about making records - thier working methods. like Wexler (above) and his live vocals, or Eno on the Hollywoodization process.  I'm just beginning to understand about the record-making process. we learned on the last At Dusk record that the energy you put into making the thing is really reflected in the outcome. we worked fast and hard, and we got back a record which had some of its hardest, rockingest parts in the places where our control didn't reach. vocals we didn't have time to redo, songs that surprised us by ending up totally different from what we started with. intention is almost impossible to pin down in the studio, as far as getting what you mean to get. i've almost given that up, finding that the recordings i make with the least amount of direction as far as qualitative goal end up being the most compelling. the goal is always to get something, anything done, and let the chips fall where they may. picking the good stuff is something you can do later.  another example is Jeff's Perspectives album, where the most compelling song is that way in part because of all the screwed up mastering i did to the track, after tweaking the mix until i was satisfied. "Being There" rocks the hardest because i didn't have time to take all the rock out of it.  so you learn by doing, and by listening to what you've done, and  trying  to put two and two together. why is this like this? what did we do? not techincally - that part is easy. but all the little things that add up, like having to reload gear every night, or doing vocals in a room with a robotic litterbox. working fast vs. perfectionism.  but i think i've thought more about how things sound than how the way i work effects what they are. recently, i've been trying to get a handle on the all the listening i've done, in part to understand why i hear music so differently than almost everyone i've had the opportunity to compare myself with. so lets see if i can put some of it down.  my favorite thing about sound ('cause that's what it is) is that if it is done right, is can seem like a 2 1/2 minute song lasts an age. this is why i like the oldies station. i think this is the basis for what i think of as psychedelic music, also. how does it work? how does it do it? i think it has something to do with focus.   to do this time-expansion thing, a song really needs a singular focus. this focus can hop from instrument to instrumen - just as long as there's always a lead line - be it a vocal or instrumental melody, a drum riff, or an intersting sound (say, a coin being spun and slowly winding down to a stop.) these things always give your ear a place to go. there can be secondary leads, but they either have to reinforce the main lead, or actually take over for a moment. but really, there's only one focus.  and a million ways to make that focus. usually it is the main melody, but sometimes (especially if the main melody is repetitive) it can be a counterpoint that grabs your attention at the second or third repitition of the song structure. sonically, the main focus has to be interesting enough on its own to hold our attention. a good singer - think of bob marley or bono, or bradley nowell, will slightly change the tone of their voice, even when holding a single note, and your brain juft follows that sound. if it were static, you'd go elsewhere. then maybe a hand-off to another instrument.  --  another thing about records and time. if you get on a vamp, like the end of a doors song, or the main loop of a hip hop song, then what you notice, eventually, is not that groove - although it is supporting your interest by providing energy. you notice the changes. if an organ melody comes in, or the reverb changes, it's almost as though that is the only thing you're hearing at all.    Hugh Murphy says, "The voice is the most important thing. It's all a bunch of chords and people making noise and when you put the voice on all of a sudden it comes into focus, like a Polaroid."  --- attention span: when i first started recording, i would rewind the track, listen, and the second my attention wandered, hit stop. then i'd figure out what i could do at that point to keep my attention. the results were successful, if a little bit dense. but as music you  had  to listen to when it was on, it worked. it is the kind of stuff that can kill almost any party. ('cause people go quiet when they listen.)  -- by contrast: party/shopping music. this is stuff like joe cocker or moby, or filler tracks on an Eminem album, that you might not even notice is on. certainly it doesn't beg you to listen, but it can be a little more insidious because later you'll be walking home or whatever, and have some line stuck in your head and you don't know where you got it.  i've always thought it would be a huge challenge for me to make this kind of music, because to do so i would have to go against all my instincts. where i'd want to capture attention, i'd have to refrain. where i wanted a change, i'd have to stay the same. i can see myself attempting to take this challenge, but i wonder if learning to think this way would dilute the imperatives i can get myself to heed when i'm arranging songs these days. or would it just expand my vocabulary?  -- another effect music can have on the brain i'm just beginning to explore. its when you have two things happening that don't quite lock-step, like a part in 6 over a part in 5. or polyrhythms. it kindof seems to take that place in my brain that likes to follow the focus of the music, and fragment it into some conflicting pieces. i listen, but don't quite follow. now, when you throw the voice in there, it somehow seems to pull it all back together. i think there are some neat ways this could be used that i haven't quite hit on yet. maybe have two kinda strange parts underneath the vocal lines, but in between lines, they get super-freaky wierd against one another, and the back to normaller again when the next line comes - like call and response, but with that disjointed void feeling of conflicting time signatures instead of a response. could be bleak.  ---  right now what i'm drawn anew too, is something i discussed with Amy when she was in town - having the music be one big sound, instead of lots of little sounds a buzzing around. she played me one track which was like that (maybe 3 sounds, but all fucked up crazy weird - which is how i like it) and my brain exploded again. so now it's time for a relavant quote:  "A big part of production is sorting out a lot of stuff that shouldn't be on the record, helping the artist lose stuff that's in their way." -Andy Wallace   i used to have this idea that what i'd do is get an almost dionysian singer (like the solo bradley nowell stuff -  sublime acoustic  and then have some kind of magical overdub section that gives the spontaneous, solo rendering of the song all the balls a rock band and 73-piece orchestra can offer. maybe that's what Jerry Wexler is trying to do by cutting vocals live. i wanna do new things, like making the vocal sound like a window into a flock of migratory birds or leaves russling. and the band sound like a busy, busy street corner. maybe a vocoder set to stun?  but before we do to much more thinking, we can listen to jimmy iovine say "With music it's either great or shitty. It's not that complicated."

      had a dream in which i inhabited an alternate reality. one where suicide girls were disrupting inspirational seminars in order to try to sleep with me. one where brandon brockmeyer was captain of a troop of clowns (no kidding), and was dressed sort of like that orange lion from spanish-lanugage PBS (that show that used to come on after seseme street.) and then the suicide girl tried to lead me into a meadow for dalliance, but it was through a babes in toyland type portal, and brandon and the clown troops were coming the other way. and they were many (about eight, i'd say). one of them was surely dylan, and i think drew also - don't remember seeing evan, and julie still was there also, dressed in flowing rainbow streamers with her face painted like a cat.  but the wierd part was when i was opening the portal door, brandon flipped out like he didn't want people who weren't of this alternate reality to see him in his lion suit. "my god man, what are you doing?"   of course, i blew it with the suicide girl 'cause i started talking to her and it turned out she only want to sleep with me to become famous. so then i talked her out of it, saying that not only was it not likely to make her famous, but that that was a bad reason to be sleeping around anyway. pick something more immediate, you know? this is part of a larger pattern where i dream about girls wanting to fuck me but somehow i put the brakes on. i'm such a tease.  it really was quite a nice meadow for dalliance.

      my toes have been sore for a few days now, i think i need to adopt some  new patterns. maybe i'll walk backwards at work. speaking of - i gave  my month's notice to miranda today. my last day will be sunday the 15th  of august. i'd hoped to pick up a bunch of shifts in july, but almost  noone needs anything covered, so i'm just scooting by and glad i don't  have to pay rent come the 1st. grandma's happy with the idea of me  living with her next month while i work and save. and alot i will -  during the first two weeks of august, i'm gonna be working almost every  day. woo hoo!       today i'm finally getting to read the financial planning for  couples book that i scooped up off my mom's floor the other night.  probably the biggest leap i've made, financially, is that in the last  few months i've gone from not planning my finances at all, to sort-of  thinking about them a little. the difference has been extraordinary.  i've probably saved $60 to $100 in overdraft and late fees alone. i  don't particularly enjoy reading self-help literature (although it has  a certain pathos all its own) but i figure once you understand it you  don't really need to go over it again.       it made me feel better when bill clinton admitted his brief  post-collegiate fling with self-help. now i'm un-ashamed to announce  that i've considered it, and composed my Value Circle. (there's even a  nice graph of a circle, with places to write Values, right there in the  book.) values are things like Health, Family, Creativity, &amp;  Learning. you get to pick 5. it can be kinda hard to do, but the point  is that if you don't know what you value, then no matter how well you  plan your finances, you could wake and be 60 with a Porche and not  care. common sense, it seems not a lot of people choose to exercise. i  haven't gotten into chapter 3 yet, so i don't know what i'm gonna do  with my Value Circle. maybe nothing.

      Eno on "Hollywoodization -- the process where things are evened out,  rationalized, nicely lit from all sides, carefully balanced, studiously  tested against all known formulas, referred to several committees, and  finally made triumphantly noticeable... It's where deficits of nerve,  verve, and imagination meet surfeits of glitz and gloss."

      Things To Consider When Playing with 50 Gallons of Urine: from: http://50gou.thebrainmachine.com/main.html      * Listen more than you play.     * Constantly communicate and share ideas with others visually and musically.     * Be Modest. Don’t dumb down your musical abilities but don’t show off either.     * Listen carefully for the dynamics of the group – Play at a volume consistent with the rest of the group (we don’t want 50 Gallons of Urine to be quickly carried away into 50 Gallons of DooDoo Loudness)     * Be Confident. If you feel like you screwed up, keep playing until you get yourself back into the flow of things. (As of now, screwing up is undefined as far as 50 Gallons of Urine is concerned)     * Try to end your riffs in key, at least with yourself, and maybe even with others if you can figure it out.     * Do not rush into playing, 50 Gallons of Urine will be started by whichever percussionist feels ready. Instrumentalists will then jump into the music, as they feel comfortable, whether it takes 30 seconds or 30 minutes; listen closely to the music before you come in but don’t be too frightened of taking chances.     * NEVER stop the commencement of 50 Gallons of Urine. It will end naturally at any time, or the engineer will signal that we are running out of tape approximately 10 minutes in advance.     * You may, however, take breaks/leave the room during the commencement of 50 gallons of Urine…just don’t make lots of racket that might get recorded.     * If you see an instrument that isn’t being played, and you know whose it is and that you are allowed to play it, feel free to swap instruments with others. If you don’t have permission to play someone else’s instrument, don’t play it.     * Don’t sing/or talk during commencement unless your assigned 50 Gallons of Urine instrument is your voice (the microphones pick up EVERYTHING. If you need to communicate with someone use body language or whisper in their ear with your hands cupped).

      extravagant? undisciplined? it depends on how you look at it, but a boy's gotta have fun sometimes. and i did - with my iced toddy coffee and a canoe (filled beyond capacity.)  the canoe man was pretty cool, i left him my african percussion toy that i brought to the lake, in lieu of ID, but then he chased us down on his bike and said "you can only have 3 in the boat! and i need that id!" so Hull jumped out and took him an ID. after we paddled out of view, he jumped back in.   out in the middle of town lake, the girls smoked cigarettes. i thought about it, twice, but never did. then we drank beer under the bridge (you can stand on the concrete base, out in the lake, when the water is low enough) and it felt like  Grease .  it was fun to see Jessica, who i had a hopeless crush on back in December, before she went to China for MTV. my crush is gone but she's still cool. and Erica was looking tan and svelte, which made her a good pair with Hull. she's got a penchant for planning - where to sit for picnicking, how to meet up with Jessica, do we get in the water now? i played devil's advocate and kept making suggestions, to enhance the decision making process. but when we got in the boat, she worried no longer about future plans, and made a great row-partner. with my knee on the canoe floor, and the oar in my hand, i felt indigenous. and i don't regret leaving that shaker with the canoe man.

      last night work: medium. came home intending to mostly do nothing (squirrel away my ruples). but then S and racheal wanted to sit on my porch 'cause they were scared of cockroaches (don't ask me). shennanigans: medium. although it was fun hanging out with racheal, who's usually real cynical, but wasn't so much last night.   skyler got the party started by showing her boobs to everyone as spiderhouse, twice!, for a dollar from racheal. if i had boobs, i'm not sure i'd flash them from my porch. but if it wasn't my porch, well maybe i'd be more open to the idea.  erica, her friend paul and i are planning to hit the sun today. it don't seem too hot, so i don't plan on having sunstroke. we'll see. no idea where to go right now. maybe sculpture falls. is barton springs open?

      spent all night recording hank. i'm beat now, but it was worth it. also got a take of S singing 'daydream believer'. it's good to be alive.  we're gonna try again some more, get good takes, build up some material. for hank's album. he's got a good song about jesus and vietnam.   work was thrilling. three martinis and an $80 bottle of wine.  my eyes are heavy.

      saw for not the first time what might be a telling fashion indicator: a girl wearing one of those tennis skirts that are so  in , but who would look cuter in something else. this is different from a girl wearing one of those who is totally helplessly uncute. no, i can tell she'd be cute, if not for the tennis skirt. (did i say that?)  you see, i used to have an obsession, a fascination, with the ladies who would grace my vicinity in those ruffled or pleated short skirts. 'cause those ladies were hott. (the early adopters, it seems, did it 'cause it was cute, not 'cause it was  in .)   (tennis skirt + green T) * hair ribbon or bandana = love  but no longer. now it's like, even if you're falling off the ugly tree, and hitting every branch on the way down, one of those branches is gonna stick you in a skirt like that. this state has had my heart going from pitter-patter to pounding in fear on numerous occasions. i believe i am finally immune. now i'll be able to learn how fast the averagely-fashionable girl replaces her wardrobe - by how long these skirts linger in circulation.  oh - but now is the time to buy, ms. deeply-ironic.

      i laugh at myself when i think of the silly things i did in the last 24 hrs. i did a lot of things, so it's actually kinda cool that so few of them were downright silly. but still i laugh when i remember reading about  urlLink the illuminati , or how did i wake up all sweaty wearing only a button-up shirt?  oh, i remember. i woke myself up by kicking a big cup of water over onto my computer - the one i'm using now. its seems to have had no ill effects, after having all day to dry off.  jackie bouvier married jfk. i saw the pictures. i thought that if one wanted to learn about the classic customs of such a ceremony (who sits where at the reception, what order the groomsmen walk in?), there's not much better place to look than in the heart of jackie kennedy.  but jackie was not a slut.  introspection: i feel like maybe my mind goes in cycles, maybe a few weeks long, or who knows, but in recent weeks - maybe starting about 3 or 4 of them ago, i've been having a hard time getting perspective on what's what in my life. maybe because i don't plan on making austin my home much longer, its hard to feel my goals as viceral things i can do now.   animal kingdom recording seems like a good focus for my energies, but it resists my will, b/c greg and amy are far away in pdx, and busy, very busy.   i'm planning on doing this bill clinton thing. about goals. i got it from the free preview version of him reading his book on audible.com. maybe i'll report back after i'm done.  the urge to "grow up". what i want is to make my career a career. how to do that? i can. i must. the time is now. these are the ways i think. i've also been having doubts about my efficacy lately. maybe because i haven't done much since  heights .   ah, the bender. i didn't drink that much, i don't think, well, ok, alot. but not a  whole lot . but i smoked a lot. and the combo can make me silly. which used to mean 'happy'. but i guess i mean impulsive and uncontrolled. prone to acting without reason. not that i did anything i regret, so much as that i get into this state, where my actions are unmediated by reason. and that can be fun and creative, but it is also a little unpredictable. and i've been priding myself on my reasonableness lately. (now i'm rambling)  2nd day in a row without going to wheatsville when i should. i made waffles this morning, but after i'd mixed the flour and milk and oil, i found no eggs. so i substituted bananas. they don't stick together like that, but they sure do stick to the waffle iron.  now i wish claire would write some bloggy-blog. or get on the audioblog bandwagon. c'mon, claire.

      so we know you can blog from the sandwich shop. now i'm home again, thinking about what to do with myself. the little taste i got of making music over the last week has got me going. i'm thinking maybe, just maybe, i can get some kind of software that will turn this laptop into some kind of recorder. i've got little loops and chords and words floating around my head, without a home. i think its time i pushed them out, like an overdue baby.  the idea of recording using this barely functioning device appeals to me. i suppose there's no reason it shouldn't work, if i can get the driver's working and stuff. maybe i'll have some fun. i've been feeling kinda rusty. fighting against a half-dead laptop sounds like a good way to fight the rust. anyone know any good freeware PC recording software?  will update if i get some progress.

      we spend a signifigant portion of our time doing the same things that we would do anywhere (on a train, in the car, at a Shop, with a Program) but sometimes we also do things that take some doing- like waterswimming, and burger eating with a view.   fireworks are hypnotic. if they lasted longer, we'd all go into alpha. the boom splash of light expands on your retina (upsidedown) and then when your brain unupsidedowns it, that means your brain has expanding lights in it, and so the whole thing gets the audience a little synchronized. i think they should have Eddie Izzard time the fireworks.   there's a certain kind of love that can be made in the park, under the explosions, surrounded by veterans and puppies and other Americans. and sometimes it's nice to make that same love at home when no else one is around. and sometimes it's nice to make more.

      i'm here, on the couch, like normal, soaking up internet rays and cigarette fumes from the drunks outside. but in a blessed twist of fate, something is different. amy is here, and i'm sort of sitting on her foot. lounging is almost profound.  last night we threw a dance party, and some people even danced, although noone as much as me and the babe. we shook it like a you-know-what, did the  hotstepper , jumped around, and nearly needed a triple bypass before going to kerby with debbie. almost everyone was there. (not kerby, silly, the party)  today plans include driving around in the caddy, and me bartending at 5pm.   much love.

      since arriving in austin, i've usually stepped willingly into the role of mediator between my parents, when they've come to arguing. tonight though, i just got up and left the dinner table, dishes be damned. the difference i think is that while usually when they fight, it's one or the other of them being unreasonable, tonight it was both. instead of running interference, i just voted - no quorum. if they want to fight, well, i won't be an enabler.  it was understandable, their behavior- both had long days of hard work. they both get irritable when overworked; tonight they were both overtired and irritable. amy tells me it's not my responsibility to keep the peace, but part of me feels that it's something i'd do for any good friend. or maybe the friendlier thing to do would not be anything at all- stay out of the way, let chips fall as they may. in any case, that is how things will be in only a little over a week.  portland is looking sweeter and sweeter. miranda today asked if i was excited, and i said, 'yes'. miranda is someone i will miss. it's as though expressing to my friends here by way of parting, their value to me- it's almost impossible to begin, so i don't.

      i gave myself a pat on the back this morning as i was having my cereal, orange juice, and coffee on the back porch overlooking the ravine. it's hard to express exactly why i felt i could use it. but to compare myself of the course of my time in austin - i feel as though i've made great practical strides  - toward making my life the one i want to live, toward making myself capable of living that life, and toward a greater understanding of what it is i'm striving for.   struggling with the infinite is something we all do everyday, in-between our breaths and the bright sunshine and the storms. i think i strive to make myself a life, instead of merely taking what comes to me, because the pleasure of idleness pales against all others. why not work? and given our minds, to direct our work, why not do good work?   and epicurus' argument against the fear of death: if death is annihilation, says Epicurus, then it is 'nothing to us.' if death is bad, for whom is it bad? not for the living, since they're not dead,  and not for the dead, since they don't exist. so why fear death, since it can cause no pain?  so i'm working on hank's cd tracklist right now, and i said goodbye to jason at the granite this morning. and i plan to get to bed early tonight, so i can wake up tomorrow and get things done. (such an easy thing)

      this sign graces the highway here in denison texas, ancestral homeland of both myself and dwight d. aka "ike". and clinton, too, for that matter.  today was long. by 9:30 me, dad, and steve were at the mediation, with k, k, and k - dad and steve's cousins, and partners in the project to turn an east texas swamp into a hot subdivision. on the table: how to keep from getting at each other's throats over small unrelated sums, so that as a group we could work toward success in the bigger picture. the result - more than we'd hoped for, both in hours in the conference room and in accomplishments. the best part - these cousins might get to be friends again.  at 6:30 or so we left the mediator's office and went to visit some old property (which had been the subject of some discussion) and it's view of the lake and the dam papa john had helped to build. after some looking about for another old lakehouse, no longer in the family, and some talk about liquor, we stopped in to see baby Dylan.  six-month-old dylan could be mistaken for a two year old, both for his size and his intelligent gaze, but for that he's still learning to crawl. he enjoys putting most things in his mouth, like my dad's glasses and the ribbon from the being-born present i got him. also, i met julia's husband ryan, who seems like a good dad and a nice guy to have around, but we didn't get to talk much.  i did get to hold the baby, until he cried. it was the only time he cried while we were there. aside from that, i think he liked me, 'cause he was always smiling when he looked at me. maybe i need to practice my baby holding.

      the refrain repeats in my head as i navigate the airport terminal. i sing, drawing out the syllables of 'anything' into a sonorous moan. fellow passengers waiting at the TSA checkpoint look at me like i have two heads. i could do  anything , i'm utterly unpredictable at this point. hide your sons and daughters.  i slept none on the plane today. there was a brief moment when i forgot for a second that i was there, but i wouldn't call it sleep. lots of space though - a row to myself and playing peek-a-boo with the tot in front of me. on the next leg (almost no layover) the deaf lady i passed notes with told me "you are a wonderful boy".  i think we finished the album. just compared notes with greg on the phone, there is few things left to do. technical things. deletion of scritchies. bounce (to disc). sleep. must sleep.  notes to Jon Cohrs on mastering - very few:  deerhead like cody chestnutt, ie. too much compression.  and  beware the sub synth triggered by the kick in many of these songs.   also, to greg. for deerhead remix, try adjusting the subsynth frequency. i usually use about 80-120. it's much higher on deerhead now. that song is not normal.   to the band: good work, my god men! i applaud your capacitors. the frequencies resonate. elmo has left the building. keep writing words for the horns, and horns for the words. tamborine trapezoid trumpet triangle. break a tow, mo' tha' mow. wimbeldon folly hamburger volley. sunshine sinks boats in moats root beer. grape leaves, baklava. tangerine, rakmaninov. sandpaper doorknob!

      A lull. We're taking a break right now afte the very very end of tracking (putting down Amy's harmonies on ATHP). Chris leaves in about six hours at this point and we still have most of "mixing" left to do. Banana Split and ATHP are in the bag, but that's it. Seven left to go including Arab Fiesta which hasn't really been begun. Its going to be a challenge, but this is where Chris eats.  We went our separate ways for dinner and such. My job is to lie silently somewhere that doesn't affect the sonics in Chris's ears while he mixes just in case he has any technical DP3 or other kinds of questions. We're reconvening at 2am to make final mixing comments and -- hopefully -- jump up and down on completion of the album.  I really think we have something here.  Its pretty silent in right now besides the whirring of the  urlLink Music for Dozens  server. Its refreshing.  All of the tasks that have to get accomplished this week (album art, titling, track order, arranging mastering, tour e-mails, catching up with  urlLink PDX POP , talking to all of my family and friends I've been neglecting, etc.) are beginning to creep up on me. That must be a sign that we've crossed some kind of threshold. Cary's playing Meri ATHP upstairs and hearing it through the ceiling just put me in a trance for a second. We just spent so much time getting all the vocal levels perfectly set. Its nice to hear that they stand up, even from the basement. I can hear everyone clearly.  I'm going to go eat something and rejuvenate before Chris gets back. Hopefully the next your hear, the record will be done.

      greg's printer just ate a slice of paper the way i eat a sheet of pizza. its the end of another long day at the album factory, and i'm having trouble seeing how we can possibly finish the project - if we were just coming into the work now, with two days left and the same amount undone, it would be no problem, but it's like day 11 (morale low), so we're gonna have to push through and see what happens. a day for mixing is not scary - but it will be hard if it also a day for vocals and whatever else needs doing.  on the agenda, retracking 'banana split' vocals, guitars on 'unwater', everything fucking else.

      Another fine day behind us, one which saw the likely end of all non-guitar-or-vocals overdubs.  After a delightful breakfast of bacon and eggs, and then a quick jaunt out to Fred Meyer to purchase a whole sack's worth of only embarrassing bathroom items, I met the boys at Prexy, intending to slather on some sexy-ass piano overdubs.  To my amazement, I was met nearly at the door by the half-smiling, half-sneering countenance of Ginny Hancock, who has moved into Prexy for the summer while the fourth floor of Eliot undergoes renovation of some kind.  She graciously allowed us to stay in Prexy for as long as we needed, pending Bonnie's approval (which we eventually got), and was even kind enough to loan us a power strip: an act of magnaminity almost completely nullified by Greg's unforseeable near-catastrophe of walking in on her in the bathroom.  Whoops.  Anyway, sexy-ass piano overdubs, which I played a whole lot better than I was expecting, were enjoyed, on PS, Unwater, and Welcome Home; I also laid down some of my thickest slabs of free-form nonsense to date on Arab Fiesta, which Chris has been afforded license to screw with all he wants, Martin Swope style.  All of that should turn out swell.  After a quick lunch at Woodstock Wine & Deli and some editing/picking up slides/playing Gamecube time, we trekked out to Gregory Heights for what we expect to be the last time, and tracked some mbira on PS, courtesy of Cary, and some trombone on everywhere, courtesy of Ethan, who, it should be noted, fucking rocks on the trombone.  With our intentions of starting early tomorrow made clear, we headed home, and everyone enjoyed a slice of pie except me, because I hadn't (and still haven't) yet confronted the prospect of dinner.  And start early we shall, as tomorrow shakes us loose from the fool's paradise of Gregory Heights and sends us careening back into the cosmic nausea of the practice space, where one must arrive early if one hopes to a.) track audio without the interference of adjacent rocking/screaming/carpentry/general rabble, and b.) avoid the management, who, despite doing a wonderful job managing, in all practical respects, happens to live there and always be drunk (too drunk for genuine comic effect) and tell endless stories in the manner of a four-year-old which, I'm afraid, are rather distracting from any tasks you may be hoping to undertake.  Guitars and vocals, then mixing, and we be done, mama.

      These last few days are running together in a pretty serious way.  It feels like I get home and am allowed no more than an hour of waking life with Jen before bedtime, and that I wake up in the morning with a maximum of twenty minutes to spare before I have to jet out the door to get back to work.  I'm at "work" now, and I've been awake for 46 minutes.  I'm not complaining; there is no way I'd rather be spending my days than knocking out this album (which grows more and more promising as the songs mass).  It's just an awfully weird experience for mind and body alike.  I have memories from about six weeks ago of living in much the same way as this when I was in the final stages of my thesis, but that was a much more isolated effort.  At least this time there are four of us all working toward the same deadline, sharing the same level of dedication/enthusiasm.  Truthfully, it's been a blast so far, very much in keeping with Chris's early assertion that it would be like going to "making a record" camp.  An exhausting blast.  I'm going to indulge in a sandwich of some sort soon, and follow that up with some serious strawberry-rhubarb pie courtesy of Ethan and Meri thank you both very much.  Then it's back to GH for our last day of basics, which will match us against [gulp] Deerhead.  I'll write another one of these later today or tomorrow, when there might be hope of actually being able to construct words resulting from neurological activity of some kind.

      So, I'm tired enough now that I can barely keep unwarranted k's, and j's out of these words I'm typing. I'll keep this short.  Maybe I'm so tired because of the way the day started: Out of toilet paper? Wet Wipes. Executive!  Or maybe, its because of the brutality of carrying stuff, followed by carrying stuff, followed by recording, followed by carrying stuff, and wrapped up with carrying some stuff. Either way, the day started out well. We got together somewhat late, Chris getting here around 12:30, while I was in the shower and putting up PS for mixing. It sounded a million times better than it had in my memory. Amazing how recordings can do that. Anyway, Chris did his magic on the track and its sounding better than any basic tracks of our have ever done, closer to completion.  Now I'm feeling like maybe the reservations of mine that Cary was talking about yesterday are specifically related to Arab Fiesta rather than all the new songs as a whole. I just feel like I know how that song is supposed to go less than the others. That means I don't really have any good overdub ideas and no way of evaluating the sound of it to figure out what we need to do. Whatever, at least I'm feeling really optimistic about the results of these new sessions and I have some renewed faith in my original theory of these new songs needing fewer overdubs; sounding better raw.  Recording at Gregory Heights was filled with more obstacles than yesterday. Matt, a member of the Portland band Cart! who we played with in January in Corvalis was around (he works for Portland Parks and Rec with the after school program we're kind of operating through). It seemed like he was supposed to be in charge of throwing us out, but instead was a super hero, let us stay and gave us the devil sign in appreciation, even of bad takes. Even with his support, we had to wait until 6 when the principal left to start actually making noise.   Even with the late recording start, we had tons of time, which we managed to fill with incomplete and imperfect takes. As Chris reminded, the work expands to fill the time. And, at the end of the night -- on the other end of pasta, Ethan and Meri's strawberry-rubarb pie, an episode of the West Wing, and a perfect-as-usual editing job by Chris -- we have really strong basics for Unwater.  Tomorrow is Deerhead and the end of basics (a landmark!). . .somehow at that point it will seem like the battle will be mostly won. All we have left to do is an infinite number of tasks in an all too finite amount of time. What could be so hard about that?

      so today at Gregory Heights, as the band was getting into their 2nd complete rendition of "unwater," i started to get funky in my chair. i was unsurfing, arms to the side, head bopping in time. it's moments like this that really make recording appeal to me. front row seats at the best concerts in the world.   so today was a, and i think this is the best way to put it, a big dig. we got in there and got some takes, good but maybe could be better, etc... and worked and worked and passed the point of getting better, and blah and see how this sentence is a run-on and doesn't quite make sense? well, that's how the day was. in editing now, we've decided to use the 'unsurfing' take for the first half, the death-metal double kick run from take 6, and the end of take 5. in a year we will have forgotten where the edits are at all.  i think it was will who told me that rick rubin says that the best drum takes are the ones that always seem on the verge of falling apart, but somehow don't. i think this holds true for all basic tracks. to my ear, interest is held by the suspense that accompanies always wondering if the band is gonna pack it in, break a string, or just plain fuck up too much to make the take usable. this was 'unsurfing'.  also, it is hard to remember not to treat the live takes, as they go down, as though they are recordings already. yes, they are recorded, but the future is not determined, and a good start does not mean a good end. a fine line we walk.

      I think I'm beginning to remember what being in school - or at least its anti-somnolent effects - feels like.  Not much sleep going on in this corner these days.  That said, I think we're doing a pretty good job of having long workdays, but not totally losing our minds and ears over it.  Greg and I threw down - I want to emphasize the violence of our actions as strongly as possible - THREW down some acoustic guitar overdubs today.l  Actually, they were quite pretty and fairly gentle.  In all likelihood, if mishandled - let alone thrown - they would probably shatter.  Also, we confirmed that I cannot sing in the morning.  We were feeling pretty confident and complacent about the work we had to do today.  We were planning on recording the basic tracks for PS back at Gregory Heights today - the least demanding track technically for all of us.  You can imagine what happened.  We went into the "studio", got set up with expert efficiency, and proceeded to knock out a series of lackluster, loping takes.  Amy was along for the ride and ended up leaving, probably feeling like she was contributing to our discomfort with the situation.  While I do like privacy, I can assure you she wasn;t a factor - we were just sucking and psyching ourselves out about doing so.    Will was having some trouble getting an opening drum part that, while it would be really difficult for me to play, is just not a part he would ever dream of being challenging, let alone temporarily impossible.  But, so it was.  We just couldn't get it together, and thus punctuated our frustrate attempts with breaks involving alternately loud laughter or silent brooding.    In the end, though, Will removed his socks, we chilled out, figured out what to simplify to cut our losses, and got in touch with the breeziness that PS needs to work.  And we got a great take out of it.  Greg and I - I'll leave the others out of it, as I don't know where they stand - seem to be having some disagreement about what needs to happen with this last batch of 4 songs, or at least how capble we are of getting done what needs to be done.  Greg is making the argument that ample time - months of it - was central to the success we had with overdubs, in terms of both quality and variety, on the last batch of songs.  I think that's true, but I think I have more confidence in the unencumbered, sparser strength of these new songs, particularly with the new recording situation.  I think we'll get some overdubs on there, they'll be good, and our time strictures will keep us from overloading these tracks.  In any case, I just can't allow myself to think that they'll end up anything other than relaizing their maximum potential.  Which I do believe will be the case.  you'll see.  East Coast tour prep, and what it gestures towards, is keeping me very excited.  Nick Drake "From The Morning" just came up on my iPod.  Talk about succesful sparseness.  Not a rock band, I realize, but my god, he blows my mind.  I'm quite anxious to hear the new song ("Tow The Line", I believe it's called) of his that they dug up for the new retrospective comp.  Lastly, does anyone else have grave fears about Brian Wilson re-recording Smile, instead of just using what was there?  I mean, did you hear that solo record?  Suddenly, Bruce Springsteen drum reverb is sounding tame...  Maybe more sleep tonight!

      Today was a day for the At Dusk Extended Family & Support Crew to shine.  I arrived home from a great warm-up breakfast with Meri at Genie's, only to find that Amy had brought over strawberries, tangerine juice and champagne for mimosas, as detailed by Will.  The strawberries were seconded when Ethan and Meri returned from a 15-pound berry picking binge at Sauvie Island.  And Amy drew a cartoon of our lives.  It's on our refrigerator.  Not as good as her joke, but still sun nice.  Ethan made his second musical tour of duty today, as he strolled with the grace of a winged gazelle from trombone to accordion.  As for that, don't believe all of the Lawrence Welk propaganda - the accordion and its cousins is a beautiful instrument, and I'm excited to reclaim it for our record. Just ask Paul Simon, Astor Piazzola, South Africans and - if you have to - the French.  Plus, Ethan wears a wig if asked to while recording, which really ups the yuck-yuck-factor after several hours of recording.  The sun came out today at night.  Or what should be night.  The day was cloudy.  7pm on was looking pretty fine and light.  The SM57/Monitor tagteam continued its march of victory today - Banana Split/Too Far is nigh on vocally complete.  Sopranos - as ever.  Plus, Meri taped "Extraordinary Cats" off OPB for me tonight.  At my request.  I also wrote several kitten-themed checks today to pay for our utilities.  I'm a boy.   And tomorrow brings us back into the real-tracks studio, which I'm ancing for.  Ancing means to be ancy, as defined by me, and whoever I point a gun at.  P.S  here we come!

      As Cary and Chris sit upstairs recording acoustic 12-string overdubs on ATHP (which will be endowed with an actual title as soon as one of us writes some lyrics), I sit in the surprisingly cold basement typing this up on Greg's laptop.  Greg's shimmering, breathtaking laptop.  I gotta get me one of these things.  Thanks to Amy and Chris for the tangerine mimosas (or perhaps tangerosas) that we all enjoyed this morning, as well as the strawberries.  And to Ethan for the raisin bagel.  That was one executive bagel.  Amen to Cary's sentiment about tracking vocals with live monitors.  The difference, in terms of the comfort level of the experience, and (therefore) the quality of the result, was extraordinary.  I'm certain I never would have gotten such a satisfying take of the final hook on Welcome Home were it not for the change of approach.  Threw some pretty sweet harmonies on top of a few parts too, and laid down some ultra-sanguine, Beach-Boys-meets-Chili-Peppers "ooohs" in tandem with Cary on yet another part.  All thanks to monitors.  Headphones suck.  Meanwhile, the song soon-to-be-formerly-known-as Deerhead remains implacable and mystifying, absolutely refusing to accomodate any of our vocal ideas in spite of the strength of our convictions.  The something-like-four hours we spent wrestling that white whale yesterday left us so downtrodden that the flabbergasting experience of tracking vocals to monitors was the only thing powerful enough to hoist us back up into some kind of optimism.  And I'd like to work on it more today, but I have an urgent date with the television to watch the second-to-last episode of the Sopranos, and as much as I can of the Lakers-T'Wolves Game 2, and another date with the freakin' washer/dryer, as I haven't done laundry in about four weeks, AND a third date with the oven, because Jen finally raved about my awesome oatmeal raisin cookies to her mom one time too many, and now I have to make her a batch.  After all that, I intend to scurry back here to track some serious vox on Come Too Far and Arab Fiesta (also soon to be rechristened).  I haven't been to a movie in a long time.  June will be my movie-going month, as well as, hopefully, my job-finding-and-earning-money-from month, since any lack of such earning will render me financially incapable of touring in July, and that sort of can't happen.  Let's see if that Pix position opens up (pull the strings, Greg! and beware of the big green dragon).  I'd also like to read a book not-for-school soon; I've lately been reading Eagleton while in the bathroom, and that doesn't seem to really qualify as "postgraduate reading" on either count.  Did I really just write that?  Wow.  I think maybe I've said enough.

      For the first time in the history of me, I put down vocals that I think sound really good, and felt good to put down while putting down.  Down puts downy downathan putter.  Having gotten pretty disappointing results yesterday when trying to track vocals for Africa/Welcome home, using our spiffy new Studio Projects B3, RNP & RNC, we all took some time to think about what kind of vocals we want, and how to get them.  I was thinking yesterday that, with my general listening emphasis geared towards instrumentation, I couldn't ever really pick between takes A, B & C of any given song.  I just didn't think I had a good sense of what makes one vocal take - assuming more or less accurate pitch - better than another.  All the more when the takes are my own.  I hear my own voice all the goddamned time.  How am I supposed to have an opinion?  It's like picking your favorite tooth-brushing experience.  Or your favorite television station if your reception only picks up one.  But that changed today, I'm happy to say.  Buoyed by the example of Bjork, we decided to not be so audiophile.  We dropped the condenser for a good ol' SM57, and tossed aside Will and my perennial complaint - HEADPHONES - and turned up the divine monitors we're borrowing from Jon Cohrs, who will also be mastering our record (www.spleenlessmastering.com).  Even with how terrific the room sounds are we've been getting at Gregory Heights, and all of the other exciting developments, tracking vocals without headphones was probably the most revelatory and exciting aspect of this process for me so far.  I could tell what my breath support was like, I could hear my own volume, and my pitch was unfettered by a piece of plastic between my ears and the world.  It was terrifically exciting, and if Africa is any indication, we're heading towards a record we're going to be very, very happy with.  And Chris know his mixing, for sure!  Forgot to eat. Ate.  Watched the West Wing.  And now there's a cat sleeping in my bedroom with Meri.  His name is speedbump.  He belongs to the people who run a recording studi down the street.  Is this a declaration of support for our DIY endeavor?  Or was he just cold, wet and incredibly affectionate...

      Just got back from closing. Got out way early (home by 2:00) after closing at 1:30. Was a pretty slow night. A pair of women came in near the end of the night. One of them was cute. The white of her left eye was partially filled up with blood. I kept wanting to tell her in case it was a symptom of some as yet unnoticed medical emergency, but didn't.  The flap of skin on my thumb is beginning to turn white. First shower and shift without the steri-strips. Its been hurting (and bleeding) a lot less, but I have a feeling its going to get worse at some point before its starts towards totally healed. Had a weird thought during the shift: The thumb wound will be a concrete way of dating time passing from recording. What will it look like at PDX POP? At the end of tour?  All throughout this shift, I was wondering how the songs we recorded in November and spent all that time doing overdubs on -- that are now starting to sound amazingly rich and lush as Chris mixes them -- are going to sound next to the new tracks with their better basic tracks left more raw. Does the new approach really fit the new songs better like we think it does or are we just making excuses to fit the necessities of our schedule? I really do think its the former, but spent the night fretting its the latter.  Going to watch some West Wing (season 2, baby!), drink my Dead Guy, and then go to sleep. Its hard to pretend its a normal night when I'm eager to see how things turn out.

      so we hooked up jon's monitors, and i had the most pleasently exciting mix-time of my life. arab fiesta sounded much more expensive than it actually was. good room, good mics, good pres. on a shoestring. the presonus we've checked out from guitar center translates the low end more clearly than anything i've had a chance to use. so the kick sounds solid and gargantuan. the M/S overheads are phase coherant, as they should be, and the bass sounds great through the oktava 319.   i'm worn out by the process, but driven to continue and continue on this road, 'cause the payoff is so high. everytime i put up a fader and hear the record take shape, with almost all surprises being pleasant, my fatigue recedes a little. i can't wait to hear PS in the room, and then through the mics, and then through the monitors.  time to make evening plans.

      This is my first formal entry on this deal.  I'm Will, and I play the drums in this band.  I thought I could use this blog as a forum to mention that this morning, for the (by my calculation) third time in as many months, I woke up with a totally confounding scratch on my big-ass nose.  It stings like sacred love.  I am reluctant to attribute this to a shaving mishap, simply because I have to imagine that, although such a wound would certainly still hurt the following day, it would doubtlessly have been noticed upon initial infliction.  Also, I don't ordinarily shave my nose.  What I am left with is the only logical conclusion: that on the nights which precede these unpleasant mornings, I am plagued by deeply distressing dreams which involve my own fingernails in some way.  I have to go rustle up some breakfast now, in an effort to fortify myself for another barn-burner of a day hammering out vocals and mixing.  At some point I have to purchase another snare head as well; the one thing Cary failed to mention in his post cataloguing the cavalcade of inconveniences which was yesterday was the abundance of mechanical malfunctions.  Seconds before our first take, my snare head broke (not 100% convinced that qualifies as "mechanical," but who cares), and Cary's Twin Reverb, one day back from its seventeenth visit to the amp shop (efficient!), began producing a brand new problem: inexplicable feedback.  But what Cary didn't neglect to point out was the fact that, upon installing our understudy duo of Marshall JCM 900 and Gregory Heights middle school marching band snare drum, re-tuned and re-mic'ed, we happened upon a killer take.  So all told, I think yesterday bodes well for what is to come.  That was a long paragraph; long enough to remind me that this computer does not dispense Frosted Mini-Wheats.  Until next time...

      Today was one of those good terrible days.  I think we knocked the pants farther off a song than we ever have before, and the room sound that Chris got us on Arab Fiesta sounds like a recording of the inside of the mouth of Yahweh.  Is it just my particular compulsion, or does filling in a text field, beginning on the first line, with no indentation, make other people uncomfortable too?  I have this trouble in word.  There goes one of my allotment of self-conscious meta-blogposts.  Today was the first of what will be many long, productive days in a row.  Will and I worked out some background vocals, and are beginning to piece-together a multi-voice, early-70s, Beach Boys-esque vocal maelstrom from ATHP.  We've never done something like this before, and it's encouraging that we're a) technically able to do so and b) comfortable enough.  It's been nice to see Will understandably more relaxed and laughier than he's been in a while, his graduation just now receding into the aftground.  Aftground.  Ass ground, you ask?  No, aftground.  To justify our feeling great about being successfully self-indulgent recording our own stuff today, it is also worth noting - and in doing so, congratulating the figure in question - that today marked the culmination of several months' worth of serious effort, self-doubt, sleeplessness and selflessness on the part of one Mr. Ethan Chessin - my once and again roommate.  Ethan has been volunteering in the SUN (Schools Uniting Neighborhoods?) program here in Portland for the past while, conducting, coaching and inspiring a 12-person-strong middle school band.  They performed today, and it was glorious.  We recorded it, which is where the we're-entitled-to-feeling-good-about-our-own-crap part comes in.  I'm excited that we'll be able to give copies of their performance to these kids and their families?  I wonder whether they'll be the type of musicians who only hear their performance mistakes on record, or will only hear the pleasure of their experience when listening.  Or, even better, come to love the mistakes.  I'm trying to do the latter.  Onward!  Thanks to Gregory Heights Middle School, Ethan Chessin, Matt of Cart (carttheband.com), and Jeannie for giving us access to the band room for recording purposes.  It beats the hell out of NWRS, and you don't get stuck in so many conversations.  There must be a way to turn recording at a local school into a successful gimmick - particularly in this town.  We thought of naming the record "Gregory Heights", but it doesn't work somehow when one of the band members is named Greg.  DC and Des Moines booked today!  Tomorrow - Paris and Duluth!

      well, i did it. i took it to the next level. i used At Dusk's anomalous basement toilet for #2.  we've got our first big tracking session today (for arab fiesta), so i'm here to make a packing list of mics or channels:  kick: d112  snare: beta87a - ART tube pre/comp; sm57 - on on shell, one on head. experiment with placement to find the sound we want. thickness from the 57, point and room from the beta87a, i think. so back off with the 87a... i've discovered the magic of after-the-fact digital time alignment, so these two snare mics can be disparate distances from the drum.  overheads: m/s matrix of B3 and ??. i will try out all the likely contenders as the mid mic first, and when i get what i consider a stellar mono drum overhead sound, i'll add the side mic of B3. cause othewise i'm afraid i'll be dissapointed in every mid mic for not being up to snuff with the B3. by putting the others up first, i'll be forced to work harder and think harder to get a good sound. hopefully a better sound in the result.  room: camcorder@!!@!  jelly donut: i call it this 'cause i wanna stick a wierd mic in one of the lockers at the band room and shut the door. shure omni.  clean room: matched pair of what we've got leftover in the corners, through the rnp, timed to the track.  bass: di (getting a real di might be the next place to put $$); probably the oktava 319 on the cab, pull it back a couple feet. unless the oktava is the mid overhead, then the c1000?  guitar amp: moded EV dynamic, right on the grille, maybe 219 also for some grangly grit.  CALCULATIONS:  we'll need 6 or 7 mic stands, a snare mic clip, a place to set the camcorder.  cables: 12 mic cables. 2 guitar cables (for camcorder harness)  variables:  which pre's to put the overheads through, presonus or motu - i'll start with presonus 'cause they have the pad, and might be cleaner.  do i have time to shower and change clothes today?

Today: preliminary gear acquisition day (B3, lightpipe input thing (gc rental), cables, etc.) and playing Chris the new songs. Also, he mixed Banana split this after noon and it sound pretty rad. Real starting tomorrow. Watch this space to become part of the future. . .

      And hereby I dive into indulgence!  I guess just using the word "hereby" is pretty indulgent itself.  Speaking of indulgence, I feel the spectre of Nabokov peering down on me, brow furrowed, displeased with my journal-keeping impulse here.  Has anybody read his stuff in "Speak, Memory" about keeping journals just being a way to try to save ourselves from mortality?  That by chronicling the minutae of our lives, we're leaving a monument to them?  What Nabokov wasn't expecting, however, is that while he's peering down on me, brow furrowed, immortality had, I totally just let my bladder go and blow some kidney-processed Mac's all over his face.  This move, subtly distinguished from the golden shower, is from this moment on to be called "The Expatriate."  I expatriate you, Nabokov.   Here we go on our record!  We have some serious weeks of work ahead of us, but I'm feeling more optimistic about this whole thing than I have in a while.  When you guys check in next week, you should expect with almost total certainty for us to be rockstars.  Or at least the president.  Or expatriated on.  Cary

      Just got back from middle of the night Belmont Inn-ing with Chris. Talking about the album, a record label, and conquering the world. We're just starting the recording process and this'll be the place to find out more about that, the big upcoming music festival we're working on (www.pdxpopnow.com), and our nation-wide sumemr tour. -- Greg

      This is the most exciting day thus far in the brief and evolving history of the PDXPOP Now! festival that Greg and I have been working on these past many months.  Case in point: within the past half hour I have heard our festival (July 9-11) and our compilation CD release bash (Thur. July 1) promoted on the air, along with "Turn A Square" by The Shins.  The interesting part about this is that this was all on 94.7 - THE FORMER KNRK!  We are actually making an audible difference and the festival has not yet happened.  KNRK has been the "modern rock" / "new rock" station with a vicegrip on Portland's airwaves.  A Clear Channel clone, a Linkin Park machine.  But, in response to trends in radio, as well as an extensive online listener survery, 94.7 is completely restructuring and repackaging itself - beginning with ditching its call letters.  Their new agenda, as dictated by the audience, includes great DJ autonomy and more local music.  In the past few days 5 TRACKS FROM THE PDXPOP NOW! COMPILATION HAVE BEEN ADDED TO REGULAR ROTATION.  The bands include some with major indies behind them (The Shins, The Thermals, The Decemberists, M. Ward), as well as Matt Wright's label-less Blitzen Trapper.  The potential for 94.7 to bring listeners to good music - let alone local music - is astoundingly exciting.  Hopefully some middle schoolers out there are hearing all this and will pick up a copy of the comp and come to the festival.  Which, of course, makes me wish that At Dusk was on the comp, but so be it.  It just feels good to be making a minor, but still discernible difference in my immediate cultural environs.  Staind is about to played on 94.7, so there's still some room to grow.  In addition, the comp CD release party is a pick in The Mercury (where there's also a full-page, full-color ad for the festival) & The Willamette Week, and articles are coming up this week in pretty much every local publication.  We've actually done this thing. Or we're doing it.  Plus we're going to have falafel at the event, which is tastifying.  "Heights" should be coming back this week.  Tour continues.  Things's looking up.  My skirt.

      Book! Book! Book!  Pop! Pop! Pop!  I spend too much damn time in front of the computer these days to muster the energy and enthusiasm to blog.  Don't get me wrong, I'm in good spirits these days - tour's coming together, PDXPOP is almost here, "Heights" will be shooting out everywhere soon, and the weather is beautiful - it's just that there's quite a bit of stasis involved in achieving this much flux!  Many of my tour booking anxieties have resolved themselves of late.  My initial instincts about which big cities would be hardest to book were completely wrong - I had nothing in California booked until a few days ago.  I hadd to explain how many damn people we know in LA and that they will come to see us.  Especially if we promise them pizza and free decoder rings (I'm not promising that by the way).  New York, on the other hand, has been booked to some extent for a while, with final Tank/Alex plans in the works.  My wish list is now: Chicago, Atlanta, Chapel Hill, Omaha.  Weird how perceptual geography differs from projectionist geography.  Also, Chris has been a good man-on-the-ground gettin Texas booked.  We'll be spending more time in that state than I originally expected, which is good.  It makes it soom more like an international tour.  Set up a show with Paul Bost in LA and one with Eric Hirsch in LA.  Old faces coming out to play.  As Greg has documented, reccently we've spent much time shrinkwrapping and otherwise preparing the PDXPOP compilation CDs for public release.  I placed them in stores in Friday, and several stores have already sold out!  We've known that we have a quality product here - 35 excellent local tracks, 2 discs, for $7 - and it's nice to get some validation from the public.  The official CD release party (the first actual PDXPOP event) is this Thursday.  the festival itself is next week!  WOW!  www.pdxpopnow.com by he way, for the 400th time.  Here is the PDXPOP oddjob I have been charged with for tomorrow:  I will be meeting Organizer Anne at the PDX Red Bull warehouse where I will pick up 36 cases of Red Bull.  I will then drive said 36 cases of energy drink to Oregon City where I will trade them for cases of water which will then be brought back up to Portland for consumption and death-prevention at the festival.  How King's Quest is that?!  I just wish I had time enough to go out and by the new MegaMan Classic series for GameCube (ALL of the original MegaMan games on one disc, including ones never before released stateside)!    Tour sounds fun.

      So, I think the endless-work-march-to-tour has started.  Today, I finished all the errands to allow us to get the  urlLink pdxpopnow  compilation ready to go into stores -- made the signs for the on-counter displays and got them printed at Kinko's, bought full sheet labels for and printed out the barcodes. Also, I ate a crepe from the Crepe Lady.   When I got home, Cary and I put on all of the barcode stickers and then I put the on-counter displays together with their signs and loaded them. They are, all ten of them, sitting in a nice little grid on our dining room table. They look all ready to enter the gridded and shiny world of commerce. A lot of work went into those. A lot of it was ours.  Since then (after a short break to watch two episodes of the West Wing), I've been working on the pdxpop Program while Cary's been working on tour stuff. I think I'm going to take a shower and then get some promotions work done.  I've got cat hair in my eyes from playing with Speedbump on the front porch.

      Spent the afternoon walking around Hawthorne trying to get people to buy ads in the  urlLink pdxpop  program. Had some success, some possible success, and some funny looks. Also, I ate a pear and signed a petition to put a cap on medical malpractice awards on the November ballot in Oregon. I am a productive member both of my elective peer organization and of my country.  Now, I am going to eat milk-fat-sugar producs and absorb some audiovisual entertainment -- err, eat noodles and cottage cheese followed by some "Idaho Spuds" (a weird candy bar I read about in  urlLink Candy Freak  while listening to the abridged version of Bill Clinton's memoir on CD (I got lazy on the hypertext on that one -- and while I already have Amazon open, no less, but I figure that no one's going to be having any trouble finding or finding out about this book right about now).

      called in to the base camp earlier today. the guys had just released thier little bird to fly into the world. cary was battling neuroses, greg computering for relief.  album anti-psychotherapy i attempted to provide, for their masterpiece is mutant. it has grown beyond our dreams, and envelopes even you now, noble reader.  past compare, i still imagine revisions and consequences. could it be that it is growing on me, that i don't want to change the things i hear? always more time could be spent, to rationalize, balance, sharpen, and refine. who are we? producers have many ways of working. as an autodidact, i tend to concentrate on whatever comes to mind, always learning and assimilating, but rarely applying what i've learned. practice, performance?   forward thinking - radically alter working method for the sake of learning. fragments, pieces, goals unwound.

      Like when the computer says 'bing', but with more going to see The Chronicles of Riddick.   Also Cary may end up as king of  urlLink dork ball , which is pretty neat. And  urlLink JC  turned some incrementally greater age than he was amidst a threatening thunder storm and  urlLink work  was slow, but lucrative. Additionally (I'd better stop soon before I run out of those), we've got four friends of Ethan's staying in -- and near -- our house. All in all, not a bad day.

      The new At Dusk  urlLink website  is online. Check it out. You can ever read this blog there. Maybe you are there now and then all of the there's in that sentences should have been here's. Spooky. But, if you are there (or if you go there), you'll have to excuse my big ugly yellow box when you're looking at the blog. It comes from the hack way I'm "syndicating" this blog. Once I figure out a new way (probably involving learning about Atom feeds and parsers and various other painful things), it'll look nicer. I promise.

      Went to see System and Station and the Forth at Nocturnal tonight. Hadn't seen a real show there (though we'd been there for craft night) and had wanted to check out those bands. We ran into  urlLink JC  there out celebrating his birthday with a friend in from out of town. We sat with them and Ryan from  urlLink Lucky Madison , a cool local label that's put out records by  urlLink Talk Demonic  amongst others. Nice guy. Used to be we never knew anyone at shows, but not since  urlLink pdxpop .  Tomorrow, we'll get from JC what will be the final master. And, we'll turn it in to Cravedog, and thus our album will be complete. Not even awkward syntax can make that sound as momentous as it is.  I've also been redesigning the  urlLink website  the last couple of days. Total transformation town. I'll be putting it up before I go to bed tonight. Pretty much just waiting to get some content from Cary after he finishes obsessing about playing the second day of the  urlLink dork fest  finals (he's probably going lose, ending the series, even though he was definitely the Pistons of the series).

      Up until Monday, the last bits of clinging gray refused to be pulled away and then suddenly, today and yesterday, its as if they never existed; a clear warm (hot, even!) summer without warning.  Today, I made significant progress on the redesign of the website. Talked to Speakeasy. Hoping to go online tomorrow night before I go to sleep with a version in which this blog will play a significant role.  We got the second reference master back from  urlLink JC  and listened to it. We are really almost there. I would almost describe what we're doing now as "finishing touches".  Work was slow but steady. Just about perfect excepting getting out a little late.  urlLink Amy  showed up near the end of the shift to carouse. When she's in her up modes, she brightens the room she's in.  For history's sake, I'll post the e-mail to Jon here:  Jon,  We just listened to the reference CD you gave us. I have some notes here for you, but first I just wanted to say that we both thought that you've done a great job and that we're really almost there.  Come Too Far: -First of all, the song sounds perfect. -This is only about the transition: maybe lose three seconds from the end (WCDA could come in at approximately 4:32)  WCDA: -I don't know exactly what you can do about this, but we thought the beginning sounded a little quiet compared with the end of CTF. Obviously the end of CTF is the peak vs. the beginning of this song, which is just about the quietest part. -One thing that might help in regards to this is a comment Chris had about this song is that its okay if we hear the compressor "pump" a little between when there are no vocals and when they are there (which causes such a significant volume differential). Maybe that kind of approach would give permission to get the volume up at the beginning -Contrary to the above, we thought the reduction in compressor distortion between this version and the last was exactly what was needed and we'd like to keep that no matter what happens with the above.  switch: Right idea, but let's not hear the fade at the end of WCDA before You Make Me Worry comes in. Let the first sound of YMMW cut off the hiss of WCDA before fading it out.  YMMW: -Sounds just perfect. Great job!  switch: At the end of YMMW, let the last tom hit decay before the first sound of Farewell Joel Dean starts in (it's this rapidly descending low pitch that the drum made). Besides that, we think the drone at the start of FJD goes on exactly long enough.  FJD: -This song is done. Again, you nailed it.  switch: Nice.  PS: -Whatever the change you made is, its perfect. This song now sounds exactly like it did when we were mixing it and were in love. Maybe the best of the lot.  switch: Nice.  Act of Violence: -whatever you did to reduce the cymbal wash and bring out the bass sounds really good. We're almost there. Maybe just a little further in the same direction.  switch: AoV ends well, but let some of the noise that we gave you before the guitar comes in at the start of Angel be there. Even that little second (or however long you have) would be a nice breath before the start of the song.  Angel: -Totally done. Again, right on.  switch: Perfect.  Tired Eyes: -To our great relief: totally done. At last and despite our mucking around, it sounds great!  switch: Totally not how we were picturing it, but just perfect -- bringing in the trombone as the first sound you hear. We never would have thought of this, thanks!  Welcome Home: -Track marking (when the number switches) should be earlier: when the guitar first comes in, not the drums -Change in bringing out bass is good. More if you can. We are really okay with that drum breakdown being impolite. That's kind of how we wanted it. -Amount left at end is just exactly right.   Overall: We are really close. This version sounded more like how its sounded in our heads than ever before. All the things here are small tweaks. We are betting that the next round will be it.  We can't say it enough: Thanks!  Greg

      So much has happened since Done (2) that I don't even know where to start. I almost feel like there should have been Done (2.1) and (2.2)s.  First: I cleaned the office.  No, I guess that's not a very good place to start since it didn't happen first (more like third or sixth), and is also not the most important things.  Again: Since I last posted: We:  Discovered a mistake in the album art: I'd left off the recording credit. I fixed it, went to Cravedog, spent an hour with Matt sorting things, distilling, chatting, and waiting for progress bars. All of this is going to push back the date for getting the CDs back, but we'll still make the beginning of  urlLink PDX POP , which is the important thing. Then, I came back here and Cary and I went through and waded through a murky world of lost plugins, changed R-eq volume settings and nearly, but not quite identical tracks to generate what will hopefully be the last set of songs that need to go to mastering. We went with: The existing versions of Come Too Far, Welcome Home, You Make Me Worry, Farewell Joel Dean, PS, Angel, and Act of Violence; the new mix of We Could Do Anything that we gave Jon last night, and a new, finally properly corrected, version of Tired Eyes. It seemed at a couple of points like we might go crazy, but I think we came out of it stronger and pretty confident that the tracks are right.  We watched some West Wing and ate dinner and then I just spent the last couple of hours doing booking e-mails for summer tour.  The upside is that the art is out of our hands and the (hopefully final) mixes are off to Jon. Before we know it, we'll be done.

      Food. Me: Cookie Cookie Sunday. Cary: Subway Veggie Sub with bad bread.  Just got back from picking up the digital proof of the album art from Cravedog. Looks pretty darn good if I do say so myself.  Last night we went back in to DP3 on Tired Eyes and figured out that the problem Cary was hearing wasn't so much his nuttiness as the fact that the stereo bounce hadn't obeyed the track automation properly. Turns out that if you bounce after having played the track all, or part of, the way through, then the automation will start with the value that it ended on and move relatively from there. The only way to make sure that you get the proper levels or pan positions or what have you all the way through is to rewind to the start of the track (thus resetting the automated values to their proper starting points) before bouncing. We did that on Tired Eyes and everything became fixed. We did it on We Could Do Anything and the universe revealed itself as being a sane and livable place.  Now, we enter the troubling neurotic/prudent zone where we have to re-output all the other mixes that didn't sound wrong to us just so we can be sure that they're right. We did that last night and now (ten hours of sanity-inducing sleep later) we are going to A-B them with the old mixes so we can see if there are any differences. Then we'll tell Jon about which tracks to go ahead with (in the meantime, he's worked on the new Tired Eyes and We Could Do Anything mixes) and he'll get a reference back to us on Wednesday. Cravedog basically gave us to the end of the week to get the master to them to retain confidence in our ability to get the CD back when we want it.  Anyway, we're on the cusp. I think probably by "Done (3)" or "Done (4)" we may actually be done.

      I gotta get my blogging momentum back up!  I kinda crumbled blog-wise under all of the last minute record arrangements, helping Meri pack up and all that.  So, for lack of original content, here are our final notes to Jon Cohrs - www.spleenlessmastering.com - about what kinds of adjustments we'd like to see made to our mastered album, having heard his first go at it last night.  It sounded quite good, and these few final things will hopefully make it exactly what we hear in our heads.  All the time. Meanwhile, we have our first post-record gig tonight, a benefit for Diane - of Dave & Diane of our practice space NWRS - who, under treatment for a particularly nasty form of cancer, could use some help with her medical bills.  Way to go Oregon!  Without further ado, our mastering notes, in epistolary form:   Jon-  I rounded up Team At Dusk over here and we gave the masters a listen tonight - great work, my man!  We were all delighted with what you did.  We felt that you did a really nice job with frequency management, for lack of a better term.  The whole thing has a nice warmth to it without turning into mud.  So, thanks for that.  Also, the main thing we wanted to see from the mastering - all of the parts sitting more comfortably together - you accomplished spectacularly.  If there is a general comment as far as adjustments go, it's that we would probably be happy to see 5-10% less compression overall (although Come Too Far and You Make Me Worry sound great on that end as is).  Also, thanks for being so responsible timewise and getting these masters to us when we needed them.  Some more detailed thoughts and requests follow:  1) Come Too Far - We thought that the crossfade into We Could Do Anything was awesome, but that it could come 1-2 seconds faster.  That is to say, a second or two less of the white noise/airfilter sound than is currently there would make it even better, we think.  2) We Could Do Anything -This track seemed a tad too compressed, generally speaking - There seems to be a click at the end of the track right now.  In addition to just fixing this with a little fade or what-have-you, we don't really want to hear any digital silence on the record (with one possible exception we'll come to), so if you could make the cut from We Could Do Anything to You Make Me Worry harder/jump-cutier.  There doesn't need to be silence there as far as we're concerned.  3) You Make Me Worry -This track sounds great (the vocals are sitting very well). -Did you boost the bass on this track?  If so, perhaps doing it a touch less. -There's a click at the end of this track right now that can be resolved the same way as the last transition.  Again, no digital silence here - just roll on over into Farewell Joel Dean's low hum.  4)  Farewell Joel Dean -  To elaborate about this transition, we think that the low hum should be 1-2 seconds longer than it is currently (before the "real" instruments come in).  Nice work bringing the birds out in the beginning. -  This was one of the songs that sounded a bit too compressed to us.  Ease off just a bit to allow the vocal stacking that happens throughout to be a little more dynamic. -If there was a bass rolloff on this track, maybe bringing a little more of the bass back in.  It seemed somehow more absent to us than in the mixes for whatever reason.  5)  P.S. -Cut 2 seconds off of the downtime between Farewell Joel Dean and this.  If there is digital silence here, it's fine. -  This song (along with Farewell Joel Dean and Act of Violence) was one of the ones that we felt was too compressed for our taste.  It seems to have buried the vocals on the verses a little much, and brought the high end of the cymbals out into too much of a wash.  If you can back it off a bit, that would be great.  6)  Act of Violence -The transition from PS to this was PERFECT!  Good timing, and we all felt it. -As mentioned above, this seemed a bit too compressed to us.  In particular, the bass seemed a bit absent, and the high-end cymbals (the ride in particular) kind of dominated.   -  If there was a bass rolloff, a little bit more bass would be good.  This might just be a result of the compression mentioned above.  7)  The Face Is That Of An Angel -  There seemed to be a little click on the transition from Act of Violence to this. -  Before the guitar comes in on this song, did we give you any extra spaceship noises?  If so, it would be great to add a second or two of them before the guitar comes in. Maybe a crossfade from the very end of Act of Violence (after the band has stopped and there are those little cymbal tinkles)? -  You were very polite in leaving the 4 minutes of ambient noise at the end of this track.  We just stuck it on there so you could have it to use as you saw fit.  As it turns out, we want it way shorter.  As a ballpark figure, we thought 3:28 of the current mix would be a good place to fade out.  8)  Tired Eyes -This is probably the most annoying comment I have, so be warned. -We did something stupid that we discovered only when listening to your master tonight, so thanks.  We remixed this song largely to bring down the level of the piano.  Unfortunately, when we bounced, we forgot to arm the automation on that track.  So, I'm sorry to say, I'll be dropping off the REAL final mix of Tired Eyes with the automation included for you tomorrow early afternoon (Sun.).  It shouldn't be overwhelmingly different on your end.  Our apologies.   -Our idiocy aside, this song sounds terrific!  9)  Welcome Home -  We think there should be no downtime between Tired Eyes and this.  Tired Eyes has a lengthy "post-song" (the snare rattle, the guitar beating etc.) which we think could crossfade nicely and gently into the opening (guitar tinkle into trombone blast) of Welcome Home here. -  This song seemed a bit too compressed, perhaps.  For example, the bass trombone blast at the beginning seemed louder than the main part of the track.  If it's possible to back off on that a little and still have the volume reasonable and all, that'd be nice. -Was there a bass rolloff here?  If so, if it was because of the trombone at the beginning or the weird loud tom section in the middle distorting or behaving otherwise weirdly, don't worry about.  This parts can sound weird.  The bass guitar seemed a little quieted down here, so if there was a rolloff, more bass would be cool. -The final fadeout on this track - and hence the record - was lovely and elegant.  We loved it much.  Good work!  So, there you have it Jon.  I hope this wasn't too much commentary to give you.  We really liked what you did with everything - these were just the last little nit-picky details.  Thanks for your time and energy - it's really added a great deal to the record.  Give me a call if there's anything to clarify or whatnot.  It's very exciting for us to be at this stage.    Lastly, what do we owe ya?  I'll be sure to get you your remuneration.  You've earned it!  Thanks for your work,  Cary

      Yesterday, we finished mixing. Will came over and we put up We Could Do Anything with the tweaks to the vocals Cary and I had made on Thursday. We played around a little and ended up going back to exactly how we'd left it. We exported and dropped a CD of the last two tracks off at Jon's house before having a nice lunch over at the Detour Cafe and a practice for tomorrow's NWRS benefit show.  All that's left now is to hear the mastering and finalize track transitions. . .

      damn. i could not have imagined that the sound-destructive powers of Sony's VAIO laptop could be so infinite. the 'Tired Eyes' mix that had me shaking with fear that all my decent engineering had been merely a dream, well it sounded just fine coming from my mom's ibook. naive of me to trust a windows machine with audio.

      we need to remix unwater before it hits duplication. can we get jon on the blog for communication? singing along feels good.  i've been listening to the song, (how does 'held for a while now' sound?) and just loving it. but oh jesus does it need to be mixed. i declare my incomplete mix insanity.  first. bring greg's guitar  way down  in from the intro. the tone, in its awesomeness, overpowers the fender. and roll a little bass off?  could be could be so powerful. the piano is too loud.   set the mix: start with all faders down. bring just the overheads to unity. now bring the piano in until it is clearly audible but not overpowering. use different combinations of mikes instead of eq-ing.  now bring in the bass. low, just enough to be felt, from the oktava. roll the low end off the di, and turn it up to conquer the toms in the overheads.  next, vocals.  start with the entry. first line, frank sinatra loud. build the other vocals around it. bus them all to a stereo compressor, maybe the vintage warmer, where you can roll off the lows also. drive to taste.  now the guitars. the most complicated part. i think start by hearing cary's against the vocals, don't worry about letting it fill the sonic space. it will. bring in greg's part, so that it only makes the song a little louder on entry. this one has to build.   now - pull the vocal submix down 'into the mix'. listen again, and  add guitar overdubs. greg's lead into the storm (G3) is the next most important, as far as listening to when adding to the mix. build around that, bringing in the ego-capstone producer lead. you shouldn't have to automate the drums at this point. listen to them, and bring in the rest of the guitars, considering extensive automation of the guitars, other than the two leads mentioned.  change focus. the next critcal element is will's coda vocal level. set this, and vocal panning at the end. now listen from the top, and think about changing guitar levels after the storm.  love on you baby, i'm a wafflehead.  you're almost there. now comes the horrible and necessary part of critiquing what you've done, and making all those minor adjustments that could theoretically rob your mix of all its potency. here, be conservative and wise. if it ain't broke, don't fix it. maybe look twice at your overall vocal level.   that's all i've got for mixing. on the Jon Cohrs front - thanks Jon, for bringing attention to unwater. i think it does warrant a remix. i'm eager to hear what the mastering sounds like on one of the better mixes, maybe Cremasta or ATHP?  working on those monitors was such a gig. thanks again!  as far as singing along goes, i've tried it, and i like it. as far as the unwater (insanity mix) goes, its makes me uncomfortable in such in a way that makes it sound quite punkish. phuey! i guess what it is is that the insanity mix doesn't agree well with being played loud. i hope jon can make all things have passed work well when turned up loud. (all that low end, so fun in the studio, but does it translate?) but cremasta would be nice to hear also. we'll hear them all, in time.

      Things are moving forward on all album fronts, currently. As I type these awkwardly parsed sentences, my slow little scanner is purring its best through some of the slides that Lindsay took on our first day at Gregory Heights. I've been working on the album art. Had a rush and then a disappointment today when a summer monsoon cleared up just as I got home from work -- perfect light for photographing the bird-glass outside. I run out there, get all set up, click and -- bzzt: no film. Citizen Photo was out of Time Zero for the SX-70 when I was there to drop off the other two rolls of black and white that Lindsay shot, so I've got nothing. Maybe, weather permitting, I'll get another chance tomorrow.  I'm using these slides as, possibly temporary, shots of the three of us for the inside of the booklet. I think we've got more lyrics this time around than last time, even with fewer songs. Maybe I'm wrong, but they still seem to take up an enormous amount of space.  We listened to Jon's first go at mastering Tired Eyes last night and today. We like what he did, but mostly we discovered things we want to go back and tweak in mixing. Its a little annoying to be moving back into a stage of the process that we thought was done, but I'm beginning to be able to imagine how good the thing is going to end up sounding so it seems worth it. Chris is afraid that Jon squashed it too much. This is kind of a weird song to start with because it was the most even recording-wise and dynamically.  Anyway, Photoshop is calling my name so I'm off. . .

      For immediate release:  The title of the new, second and executive album by At Dusk is  "Heights"   The record is currently in the gentle and able hands of our PDXPOP friend, Jon Cohrs (www.spleenlessmastering.com), where it is becoming masterful.  We got two alternate versions of Tired Eyes to listen to yesterday, and the results are pretty exciting.  Hopefully, we'll have this puppy off to Cravedog by June 14th, so as to have it in our mitts for tour.  Greg is finalizing the album art today and tomorrow.  Maybe he can post a link to it when it's done.  It's a photograph - a change for At Dusk.  But an At Dusky one.  I've been remiss in my blogging duties these past days - I was in Puget Sound (Camano Island to be precise) with Meri for 3 days in celebration of our 9th (?!) anniversary right after we finished recording, which was wonderful decompression.  You ight have seen that it was recently the lowest tide in a decade in Puget Sound, meaning that all sorts of sea creatures were exposed to us as we walked out onto the Sound that wouldn't normally have been.  Clams and oysters shot 6-ft high streams of water at us.  Heights.  More later.  Many thoughts.  Make you eat em.

      That's it.  That is our final, henceforth immutable, unanimously-agreed-upon album title.  "Heights."  It grew very naturally out of Greg's cover art idea, which centers around a Polaroid of Gregory Heights middle school, where we were lucky enough to record about half of this magnum opus of ours.  I hope Greg will soon post a jpeg of this album cover in an entry of his own, once it's done.  We're finalizing the back cover, the booklet, the typeface, and other such matters which together constitute the visual complement to our auditory madness/genius.  I also listened earlier today to two samples of mastering that Jon was nice enough to provide for us on his FTP server; it seems he mastered Tired Eyes in two different versions, once of which rolled off a bit of the low end to clean up and space out the overall sound at the expense of bass, and the other of which left the bass in, which both thickened and obscured the sound.  We agreed that the former approach yielded the better result.  But it might need a slight retouch on the boards first (everybody do your Biz Markie impression: REMIX!); the piano is deafening whenever it sounds, and my voice, which enters at the end to harmonize with Cary's chorus melody, instead completely overwhelms it.  We've got a different sort of mixing debacle on our hands with We Could Do Anything, whereby it seems that all voices piped through the left-side channel are about 600 times louder than those in the right-side.  Hopefully these can get resolved soon; the other seven songs sound superb, even unmastered (a special nod to Come Too Far and Act of Violence, both of which sound gargantuan), and from what little I got to hear of Jon's work, I think he's pretty splendid at what he does, and we've done wisely to put our product into his hands.  I expect I'm going to be very happy with this work once it's done.

      on the flight back to austin, i debriefed my self on the record-making process. this is an updated and expanded version of that interpretation. i encourage all who participated or observed to extend this discussion. the more we learn the better we can become.  1) more time for vocals  the vocals on this record came out miraculously, especially considering the limited time and concentration we had to develop the material and production values. by the end, though, we were really in a groove. tackling a harmony-heavy track like ATHP was really a good way to become effecient in the process. and the result, executive.  2) more time  always a luxury. but can a surplus bring laziness? at what pace should we record if time were not an issue?  3) write in studio?  the epitomy of studio luxury is the 'writing in the studio' mode of production. the beatles, radiohead... and countless other bands, many of which suck. too much time can breed too much perfection, at the expense of greatness.  4) better ergonomics  sitting on the couch all day, though not without its comforts (thanx for the backrubs, amy!), is not really a long term solution. all in all, i recommend a longer period of preperation for a session. perhaps a chair.  5) grocery shopping  and on that note, some canned soup would go a long way. we ended up buying water and chips, but much of the studio time was spent scared of the chips. how do they make those, anyway?  6) a less-temporary location.  this record was shot 'on location' by a camcorder not running video. we were at the middle-school band room, letting it all out. but then we had to load gear each day for as many hours as we recorded. we got good at it.   staying in one place could have its downsides, both sonic and otherwise. lethargy is one of the feelings that kills a record. you've got to work quickly enough to avoid lethargy. perhaps more time would bring more focus? i'm just beginning to explore the virtues of multiple takes. maybe we should do 50 - like george martin. yes, i do fancy the fab four. is it possible to comp live takes? would require a drum machine. fuck drum machines.  7) days off  to recuperate. sleep on the other-hand, is also a luxury, towards the end.   verdict: having more ti;ll;j['me would be nice, but a deadline doesn't hurt either. ldsal;kasjf [';lasf '[ \ as  asdf;l as f ] [asdf'k   ;asdf;l ]    opj;'  ' [pdoflj ;lkj k]     ' ]    excuse me, i was just practice using the backsace with my pinky. i'm relearning after the carpal tunnel syndrome i've been experienced after long periods of no exercize. keyboard. mouse via usb. i can't believe i didn't think of plugging some of greg's outboard control surfaces. the mouse and the knob. could have saved a lot of clicking, and a lot or wrist twisting.

      Right now: PS playing from open headphones plugged into Cary's computer on the other side of the desk. I'm just running it through (again) to make sure that the 7.7db of reduction that the R-eq came up with is enough to prevent the master fading from clipping. Just at the end there last time it seemed to want to take off another 0.1db.  Spent the day doing a laundry list of album-finalizing tasks. I returned the Avalon's power supply and cable, dropped of Jon's monitors, and now I'm going through and outputting final mixdown's to hand over to him for mastering. -- Hold on, PS is almost over. Yep, it wanted 7.8. Now I have to bounce again. -- Also, I did actual laundry.  In a certain way, this is the most terrifying part of the recording process. The songs are in there, sounding just right, in that silver box and now we've got to get them out. We're involved here in a terrible mass of competing standards and technical definitions (it turns out we should output even our 16bit mixes as 24bit files because it creates more headroom for the summed stereo channels, but while it may matter whether or not we're running at 44.1, 88.2, or 96khz, it doesn't seem like that's a switchable option in DP3 unless you have the MOTU plugged in in which case it seems like it relates only to playback and not to output, and, at least according to Jon it doesn't matter very much.). Not ruining the songs at this point involves successfully navigating a series of endless dialog boxes, pale highlights on soundbites, and invisible cursors. Not exactly the most creative kind of task and not the kind you want to be doing at the end of two of the most exhausting weeks in memory.  At least, tomorrow morning, I'll get to put them in Jon's hands and be done with it. And, best of all, he thinks he can get the mastering done in time for us to get the album back before PDX POP. Its somewhat unbelievable ( urlLink Chris  definitely didn't believe it; he called this morning frantic with a new idea for some pot-banging sound at the beginning of Unwater. I tried to let him down easy; its a hard thing to adjust to the idea that we're done) that we've reached this stage, but before I go to sleep tonight the album will be closed.

      Last night we played a show in Denton, TX, a college town just outside the Dallas-Ft. Worth Metroplex. It was about a four hour drive from Austin that we did starting at about  four-thirty. We got to the club right about at nine at the end of our assigned load-in window becuase of difficulties finding the club -- the Rubber Gloves Rehearsal Studio and bar -- which was bizzarely located in the middle of the industrial zone on the edge of town.       When we finally got there, the show ended up being about average for tour: a dark divey-looking place that turns out to have some history on the circuit that good bands play (posters for Mates of State, Don Caballero, others), starting late and playing to only a handful of people -- this time aggravated by the fact that this was a college-town bar in the middle of a summer rainstorm. There were, as always, a couple of things that set this show apart: while waiting for the soundguy, we ordered a pizza, not expecting it to arrive until after our set as the club was pretty removed from what passes for Denton civilization, only to have it show up seeminly instantaneously and be quite good: J &amp; J's knows their stuff. The two other bands, The Glass Factory and The Tah Dahs, each had members that qualified as (very) minor indie rock celebrities: Glass Factory bass player had been in Mineral and The Tah Dahs singer/guitarist has played with the Polyphonic Spree. Both bands were pretty good, a strong 7 or 8 each on the scale of the bands we've ever played with.      After the show, we loaded our stuff into the van and headed back towards Austin. It was about 1am and it's a long drive, but we'd been getting to sleep pretty late on each of the previous nights so we figured we might as well do it and have the full day to spend with Chris. When we finally found our way onto the highway going the right direction, it started raining. Or, more accurately, it started raining again, since the condition of the road showed that it'd been raining pretty heavily on and off for a while. The rain built and built, coming down in heavy sheets reducing visibility and roaring as it banged on the van's roof. Then it would suddenly die off for patches between torrents. Each section of the storm was worse than the last, finally forcing me to slow the van to about fifty since I could only see for feet in front of me. A new and exciting danger developed then in the form of speeding towers of light and noise -- big rigs that couldn't slow down safely in the wet and couldm't see small cars (like our enormous, SUV-limo sized van) in the squall. We pulled off the highway, fording a side road ankle deep in water to get to a Mobil travel center and gas station. We took a Polaroid under the gushing overhang overflow and then headed inside, standing momentarily inside the sliding doors shaking our head in disbelief and an attempt to dry off, as would, we'd soon see, every other incoming customer. After using the bathroom (and especially the hand dryer, for cycle upon cycle) and wandering around the inensely-white-lit store staring at candy and leafing through Maxim, FHM, and Smooth (the particularly excellent latino version), we sloshed back out to the van to decide what to do.      After a discussion with a kindly highway patrol officer with a deep and wide scar on his left cheek about road conditions and a vote of two-to-one, we decided to drive over and park in the McDonalds parking lot to sleep until sunrise. We called Chris to leave a voice mail telling him not to worry about our absence. Just after getting off the phone, as we were settling into our cramped quarters in the van and preparing to grouse about the flood lights in the parking lot, there was a particularly forceful blast of lightning and all of the ourdoor lights went out within our field of sight. We slept fitfully for about three hours in the half-gloom.      After a relatively uneventful, if wet, morning drive (featuring a particularly pleasant listen to Mingus' Ah Um) we arrived back, alive, at Chris's apartment and fell on the floor asleep. Now, food and some solid loungin' hours later, we're getting ready to go see I Robot. We probably won't tell you how it is.

      So, this internet thing has been much more elusive on tour than one might have expected. Traveling around this big unwired country we've had few opportunities to broadcast our doings in the charming if quirky way that might be expected.    Now, we're in Austin, sitting in the cafe just under Chris's balcony -- The Spider House. I just finished my espresso milkshake and so am revved up to start catching up on some of the events of the couple of legs. I've got a bullet-pointed list of everything that's happened in my little black moleskin book, but maybe I'll page through for selected highlights and articulate them here as anecdotes, with the bullet points only for context:    17 July  -up at 1 at Carol's  -lunch at Taqueria Cancun  We walk down the street and through an intersection towards 826 Valencia, Dave Eggers' so-called "independent pirate supply store" in the Mission. We pass the clutter of mid-height, pale-colored, dirt-crusted  buildings, cross an intersection and see a strangely pristine, new storefront with the words 826 Valencia in gold letters on the purple front and a towering front decorated with splindly pseudo-architectural drawings. This is 826 Valencia.   We stand for a minute in front of the display window trying to decode the meaning of this white-washed skeleton leaning over a cracked wooden chest wearing a red t-shirt and a misty expression. There are Russian vocabulary cards on the floor. and costume jewels strewn about.  We go inside to find an space not entirely unlike the interior of a giant gilded oak cabinet. There are displays of small rings and other knicknacks with magnifying lenses infront of them. Above this viewing station, a large box hands ominously, it's bottom door tied to a thick braided rope that curves back behind the counter. As we walk around the periphery of the small room, we come across a series of inset drawers with cryptic labels. "Crushing" reveals a series of marble mortar and pestles. We find piano hammers, a box of scarves, small pirate figurines. Also cut into the walls are a series of dioramas, like Cornelll boxes without the glass they seem to illustrate obscure moral lessons.  Amongst all the books and tourist daubles, we find old copies of Might, Eggers' magazine that plays prominently in A Heartbreaking Work. I browse through a small novellalette of his about a fictional Orange County politician while listening to the kids writing class being held in the roped-off back area which extends oppulently off the store. We buy some small things, including the "Goals" sign Cary mentioned in an early post, chat with the girl behind the counter about the David Sedaris live album playing in the store before heading back out into the city.  The trap over the jewel display is never triggered in our presence.  -an hour break  -drive to the Hotel Utah  -unloading  -watching the other two bands soundcheck  -getting set up  -a short wait  -Carol shows up with about ten of her med. school friends  set:      You Make Me Worry      The Image      Angel      PS      Reid's Song      Starman  -we cut Deep End due to time  -Will and Jen head out to go to a party of Jen's friends  We head up to the balcony area that hovers in the middle of the Hotel Utah, dividing the sunken stage section in half. We chat for a while with Carol's friends while One Ring Zero, the next band sets up. We head down to the bar and manage to weasel some garlic mashed potatoes and warm spinach salad from them despite the kitchen being closed. One Ring Zero takes the stage: a drummer with a box drum for a throne, an accordionist, and a Clavinettist -- a kind of accordion that one blows into through a straw poking out the top. Their songs all have lyrics by famous authors, commissioned explicitly for the purpose: Paul Auster, Lemony Snickett, Michael Chabon (actually, they used his rejection letter), Margaret Atwood, etc. They had some kind of connection to Fresh Air, either a segment about them, or their participation in a segment about the Clavinet. No surprise, they were from Brooklyn.  -Las Pesadillas (Jewish-folk violin-tinged rockabillly)  -loading our stuff back into Cary's car  -a homeless guy comes by saying he just got done working "security"  -drive back to Carol's  -meeting her there after she takes the bus back from the bar with her friends  -sleep    End day 1. Maybe future entries shouldn't be this long, but there won't be as many pirate supply stores to describe so that shouldn't be a big problem.

      4:15 am: the phone rings. it's will, calling to wake me up. the guys had just got off the highway and needed some further direction. i talked them through it, and then stood on my porch, where hank was sleeping, and listened to the squealing and laughter coming from spiderhouse. soon flashbulbs began to pop. i peered through the window, but saw no titties.   soon enough, at dusk rolled up in a stretch-van. we joked about bugs and big stuff and stuff, and then i fell asleep.   today i saw the record for the first time - it looks real. like even realer than the last one. so tonight, you go to the Hole in the Wall, and listen.

      Man, I tell you, blogger is not always to be trusted.&nbsp; You notice those blog posts with no text?&nbsp; Yeah, there's supposed to be text there. I should know - I wrote it.&nbsp;In fact, it's so untrustworthy it'll probably remove this section of my post in horrifying, dystopian HAL-ish fashion.&nbsp; We could always defect to the Portland-based livejournal...Do you hear me BLOG?  Anyhow, we've been remiss in our blogging duties more or less since PDXPOP started, running all the way through to now.&nbsp; Now is July 22.&nbsp; We are in LA, having played our 4 California dates for our friends and family. And superfans, of course.&nbsp; Tonight&nbsp; I go to dinner with my family, tomorrow I go visit camp after picking up our newly requisitioned 15-person passenger tour van.&nbsp; We will post the following text in our van, purchased in the form of a weather-worn flyer&nbsp;at 826 Valencia, Dave Eggers' independent pirate supply shop located in the Mission in San Fancisco:  Goals: 1) Plunder. 2) Meet new people. 3) Learn valuable new skills.  And now I shall begin a fragmented recounting of the past weeks.&nbsp; One bite at a time, luckyduckies.

      So, it's pretty late, I'm pretty tired, and I left my little black book with all my notes from which I was planning to construct a witty and fascinating account of our first almost-week of tour at Cary's tonight after our show -- weird being here and, particulalry, there where we've so often been while not on tour -- so I can't regail you with all of our adventures thus far along the road. I thought that as a teaser, I'd give you this. It's an e-mail a friend of ours from high school sent tonight explaining why he missed the show. I will preface it only by saying that we were sad not to have seen him tonight and that I have no strong feelings about the story's veracity. When it comes to Derek, nothing surprises:  ---------- Forwarded message ----------From:  urlLink derekforj@aol.com   >Date: Thu, 22 Jul 2004 04:21:17 EDTSubject: Re: At Dusk - Intranational TourTo:  urlLink cary.clarke@gmail.com ,  urlLink will_hattman@hotmail.com ,  urlLink greg_borenstein@hotmail.com   Dear Cary, Will, and Greg,   Around 7:30 tonight/last night both the people I was gonna bring toyour gig with called and cancelled - one with a 'cold' and the otherwith girlfriend issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;So at around 8:15 I set off on my own.&nbsp;&nbsp;After45 minutes of waiting, three metro busses, and a seven block jog Ifinally made it to the Big Foot lounge around 10:05.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, youall played there yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp;It took me about 20 minutes to figurethat out that I had mixed the up the venues.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to be deterred Iimmediately phoned for a taxi, which took a half hour to get there,and ordered the cabby to high tail it to the Silverlake lounge!&nbsp;&nbsp;Aboutfifteen minutes later he dropped me off next to 'Graceland' which, inhis defence, is a lounge in Silverlake just not the right one. Fortunately Graceland wasn't too far from my actual destination, onlyabout a mile, and with the directions the friendly Graceland doormangave me I was able to jog to the Silverlake lounge in under tenminutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, by the time I got there - 11:15 - you all,paul bost and his band, and everyone else had already hightailed itout of there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having blown all my money on covers, bus fare, andtaxicabs I was forced to walk home through Hollywood - a journey thatincluded a lengthy discussion with a homeless man from Sioux City,South Dakota who wouldn't stop following me and brief incident where Iwas mistaken for a male prostitute by two extremely high women intheir forties driving a sports car that looked to have been crashedboth frequently and recently.So while I didn't exactly make it to your show, it wasn't for lack oftrying.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you guys played a great set. I'm really sorry I missedit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Good luck with the rest of the tour and please let me know thenext time you play L.A.  your most exhausted fan,  Derek.

      As Will mentioned below, before I unwittingly upstaged his post with my PDXPOP party post:  Our 2nd album "Heights" is now available for public consumption!  We've got 1000 of these babies burning a whole in our basement.  If you're smart, you'll get a copy now, as we're likely to sell out before this time tomorrow.  I mean it.  Such disparate figures as Kofi Annan, Saddam Hussein, Bismarck, Dracula and Sir Toby Belch have already placed advanced orders.  We'll give you a copy cuz we want you to hear it.  Of course, we wouldn't refuse $5 from you if you offered it to us as a token of your support.    WAHOOO!!!!!  Looking forward to sharing this with all you folks as we merrily roll along in a matter of weeks...  P.S.  I've been trying to post this message for 5 damn days.  What's up with blogger?

      Despite the images that the title of this post may have conjured for you, this deals with a less corporeal experience, but one no less ecstacy-inducing!  Last night (July 1) was the first actual PDXPOP event.  We had a CD release party for the PDXPOP Now!  2004 compilation CD at Holocene here in Portland.  We were feeling pretty optimistic about the event, as we'd had some good press in the week leading up to it. But the reality of the event far surpassed our expecctations.  IT WAS AWESOME.  We had 280 paying customers, each of whom received a free copy of the comp with admission.  However, we went through somewhere in the neighborhood of 400 CDs, 6 hand-screened-by-me-and-mostly-Greg tshirts and a ton of raffle tickets.  By any criteria, this was an unqualified, bonafide sellout of a success.  It was a room full of Portland hipsters, but somehow there wasn't any hipster attitude in the room.  It felt like a community.  It felt like a city.  It felt like people gave a shit about what we've been puring our hearts into for the past many months, which was extremely gratifying.  If last night was any indication, the festival itself - next weekend - should be amazing and uplifting for all.  And much more press to come this week...  If there's a downside to all this, it's that we're out of the 600 CDs we'd earmarked for retail and public consumption.  we'll have to reallocate, and perhaps re-order.  Certainly nothing worth crying about.  Will and I had a good talk at the party last night.  Just revisited the fact that we've been friends for a long time and appreciate each other in both that capacity, as well as collaborators, no matter what friction we experience from time to time.  Mostly, we're just getting excited for tour, something we've all dreamt about for most of our lives and, consequently, want to enjoy as it happens as much as possible.  So, yes, the marathon of exciting AtDusk/PDXPOP occassions has begun.  Perhaps this record should have been called The Summer of Promises Kept.  Speaking of which, here comes another post...

      ... and I've just received word that Heights is finished.  Back from Cravedog.  Saints be praised!  Greg and Cary are picking up our run of 1000, I will rendezvous with them to help unload the cases, and then we will have copies upon glorious copies to distribute far and wide.  I'm going to see David Schiff's new piece premiered in Kaul tonight at 8.  Anyone wanna tag along?

      So amid crippling stomach problems yesterday, most likely anxiety-related due to upcoming tour and absence of girlfriend, I went down to Holocene around 10:00-ish to check out the PDXPOPNOW compilation CD release party.  With a $5 cover and a free copy of the CD for all attending, it was packed.  Absolutely packed.  There must have been 400 people there.  I was stationed behind the raffle-table with Greg and at the door with Cary for most of the event, and I watched the count of CDs rapidly, rapidly dwindle.  It was pretty remarkable.  At the time that I left (about 1:30), there were a total of about eight CDs left ALTOGETHER, including the ones given out to stores (which, by the way, have been selling like wildfire themselves).  This is eight left from a pressing of a thousand.  Larry Crane was shitting a brick.  I haven't blogged in a while, and was eager to jump back on, and I consider myself in a unique position to post on this matter because I haven't spent the last three months utterly committed to the architecture of PDXPOPNOW, and entrenched in all the concomitant planning and grunt-work, as my bandmates have.  Last night brought my first taste of the PDXPOPNOW experience, and I was thrust violently into the reality of what a big deal it is.  Somehow, despite all the scuttlebutt, and the supposed prominence of the comp's tracks on KNRK (I say supposed because I have still not tuned in to confirm), I remained pretty much in the dark about what a phenomenon this initially little idea had turned into.  It took a first-hand visceral interaction with the monster itself to wake me up.  It's really taking the whole scene by storm, and we're right at the epicenter; lucky us!  So in other news, Ethan won a gift certificate to Reverb at the raffle last night, and Lucas and Katherine won a messenger bag stuffed with a book about the history (?) of Doc Marten boots.  I had two tickets in hand, and naturally was holding out for the 5 hours of free Jackpot! time, but ended up leaving before the announcement, and entrusting my tickets to Greg.  I get the feeling if we'd won, he would have e-mailed me.  It was not to be.  Also, Ethan was going around asking everyone he ran into if they could remember the plot to "Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH."  I realized, in a moment of panic, that it had been literally sixteen years since I'd read that.  All I could pull out of mental mothballs was that it involved a wise old Teiresias-like rat named Nicodemus.  Anyways, to conclude: with a turnout of over 400 at the comp release party (21-and-over, $5 admission), I can only imagine what kind of throng will beat down the door of the three-day event itself (all ages, free of charge).  This will undoubtedly be the biggest show of our puny little lives, even if our set does begin at 2:40 in the afternoon.  Pretty thrilling.  In other news, I'm lockjawed with anticipation about the prospect of tour.  I can't contain my excitement.  We just booked a show on the 17th in SF, which then would necessarily take us out of Portland on the 16th, and would give us the 18th to just idly soak up the city, unless we end up booking something in Sacramento for that day.  Then we've got another gig on the 19th, and then two on consecutive days in LA: the 20th and 21st.  This is all pretty overwhelming.  To play a show in LA at a venue that is neither the Natural Fudge Co. nor my garage has been a dream for a good long while.  Did you hear about Brando's death?  That came as a shock to me.  I guess I didn't realize he was as old as he was.  He always just kind of seemed indestructible, which I guess was an impression that stemmed from that almost other-wordly strength and potency that he tended to radiate in his performances.  Also, I've just woken up, I mean minutes ago, so if none of the above makes even the slightest smidgen of sense, I can only be blamed inasmuch as I decided it'd be wise to blog immediately upon waking up.  So I guess that means I can be blamed entirely.  Shut up.

      Here's a nice little piece on us from the Nashville, TN weekly:     AT DUSK  This Portland band insist they're not being facetious when they say they're influenced by Philip Glass and Romanian Gypsy music as much as by their more obvious indie- and post-rock antecedents. Despite their fluency in sounds that reflect the dour reserve typical of the latter, At Dusk distinguish themselves with a sunnier outlook, which they maintain even when their lyrics are nakedly revealing. Without overplaying their offhand sense of humor, songs with suggestive titles like "You Make Me Worry" and "Act of Violence" stay afloat instead of sinking under the weight of the band's attitude. A trio with one former music student and the two others with some formal training, At Dusk sound very much like students—they poke, pluck and prod at horns, xylophones, cymbals, guitar strings and the like such that the craft in their writing recedes behind a veil of wonder but ultimately isn't lost.

      Tucson is a medium-sized college town in Arizona populated mostly by ninjas. Said ninjas are attracted by the sounds of post-hardcore / post-metal music madness. Upon hearing the aforementioned music, these teenaged ninjas form a circle and begin to parade around, looking at one another, eyeing each other with vague aggression, swinging their puffed-up chests from side-to-side like Looney Tunes gorillas. Upon hearing a musical cue that only the adept ninjas are immediately sensitive to, these ninjas flip the fuck out. They spin-kick like the brothers in Final Fight. They seem to teleport from one place to another like MegaMan at the beginning of a level. They swing all inanimate objects around wildly towards each other, occasionally making contact. They stomp their legs one after the other, windmilling their opposite arms simultaneously.  This is the most amazing dancing I have ever seen.  Apparently it's the standard in such musical circles nowaday, but I'd never seen it. In one of many chance, inevitable, small-world encounters on this tour, I saw this phenomenon in action to the tunes of Bleak December. I learned that this was the band's name when I ambled on over to the merch table, where it rang a bell in my mind. Bleak December....aha! One of my ex-campers was, last I had heard, playing drums for a semi-pro neo-metal band, and this was it. How odd to meet in Tucson! Unfortunately, he and the band had parted ways a few months before, or we might have had quite a reunion.  Additionally, some dude noticed my Joggers shirt and a smile came across his face. Apparently, though now in Tucson, he'd helped them book a show back in Illinois and asked me to pass his CD on them at next meeting, which I will hopefully remember to do.  This all, as well as our gig, took place at Tucson's all-ages venue called Skrappy's. We were all really taken with the kids at this place. We played on what turned out to be, at least nominally, a "battle of the bands" night, although no battling took place aside from ninjas v. ninjas. There were 8 or so bands, none of whom bore any stylistic resemblance to the others. And the kids sat there and listened to them all. Including us, though they had surely never heard of At Dusk. They were jovial and responsive and helped us have a great time. In fact, we've had a hell of a lot of great times on tour so far. I write this now in my Aunt &amp; Uncle's place in New Orleans, where we had an off day to explore the city. More on that later. I hope nobody minds the lack of temporal organization here. Think of these as snapshots.  Thanks to Mike Wolin and his friends Megan and Jen, who graciously housed us in their shockingly unstudent-like apartment in Tucson.  Onward to Nashville tomorrow!
