      Happy Memorial Day!  As we remember and honor the tremendous sacrifices made by our brave men and women in uniform, let's not forget that the Commander-In-Chief, who is spending a good part of this weekend basking in the glow of those who fought and perished in JUST wars is, every day, creating more and more veterans himself through his rash and unilateral warmongering.  Meanwhile, the leaked memo that revealed that the 2005 Bush budget calls for a massive cut in veteran's benefits, one has to ask, "Who REALLY supports the troops?"

      Y'know that HUGE deficit we have now?  Y'know that the war on terror isn't actually accounted for in Bush's budget plans, right?  Well, the administration is already planning to slash domestic spending in '06 as a way to "control spending," says the  Washington Post :  2006 Cuts In Domestic Spending On Table   By Jonathan Weisman Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday, May 27, 2004; Page A01    The White House put government agencies on notice this month that if President Bush is reelected, his budget for 2006 may include spending cuts for virtually all agencies in charge of domestic programs, including education, homeland security and others that the president backed in this campaign year."

      Pleasant Poll Particular:  Salon.com is reporting that the key swing state of Pennsylvania is turning BLUE:  "May 27, 2004  |  HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- John Kerry has erased President Bush's lead in the swing state of Pennsylvania, according to a poll that found growing opposition to the war in Iraq.   Democrat Kerry is supported by 44 percent of the state's registered voters while 41 percent favor Republican Bush, making the race about even, according to the poll released Thursday by Quinnipiac University. Independent Ralph Nader draws 6 percent and 7 percent are undecided.   A similar poll in April showed Bush leading with 45 percent to Kerry's 39 percent.   Only 42 percent of the respondents in the new poll said the war in Iraq was "the right thing for the United States to do," continuing a decline from 52 percent in a March poll."

      There's an unintentionally (I assume) funny headline on CNN'com's homepage:   urlLink Ashcroft: "Clear and present danger to America"   Yes, it's about the latest vague, unspecified terror threat - are duct tape sales falling off? - but the phrasing is eye-opening, to say the least.  *********** I find it interesting that the US is balking at giving the will-be-sort-of-soverign "New Iraq" any veto power over military operations inside THEIR country.  Reason given?  According to Colin Powell, "Ultimately, however, if it comes down to the United States armed forces protecting themselves or in some way accomplishing their mission in a way that might not be in total consonance with what the Iraqi interim government might want to do at a particular moment in time, US forces remain under US command and will do what is necessary to protect themselves."   Seems to me they wouldn't have to worry about protecting themselves if A) Bush hadn't recklessly sent them there without any substantial multinational help or adequate equipment, and B) the operation had been the easy "cakewalk" we were assured it would be.  ***********  Abrupt Change Of Topic Dept: Did you hard-core "24" fans see the finale last night?  What did you think?  I have to say that I came away disappointed.  It looks like they'll need a raft of new characters to back up Jack in Season Four, that's for sure!

      Well, the reaction to the "big" speech?  Not so good.  The Iraqi man on the street?  Unimpressed - they want more specific details.  (Don't they know this president doesn't "do nuance???")  The Washington Post says: "Bush did not provide the midcourse correction that even some Republicans had called for in the face of increasingly macabre violence in recent weeks -- from the assassination of the president of Iraq's Governing Council and controversy over dozens killed by U.S. warplanes at a purported wedding party to the grisly beheading of an American civilian."  Also, "He asserted that extremists now see Iraq as "the central front in the war on terror."   Interesting.  Seems to me that we MADE it the central front by INVADING A SOVEREIGN NATION!  (Sorry for the all caps.)  If you want to read the most recent polling data, go  urlLink here .  Um, it's not real good news, for Mr. Bush.  And the image on that page?  As the Mastercard ads say, "Priceless."

      I missed his appearance on 60 Minutes last night - my 20 month old daughter was attempting to use the potty! - but what this retired general, who used to run Central Command (meaning that he was in charge of ALL troops in the Middle East) had to say about the course of the war - you know the course we're supposed to "stay" - is alarming, to say the least:  From the transcript:  “There has been poor strategic thinking in this,” says Zinni. “There has been poor operational planning and execution on the ground. And to think that we are going to ‘stay the course,’ the course is headed over Niagara Falls. I think it's time to change course a little bit, or at least hold somebody responsible for putting you on this course. Because it's been a failure.”   In his book, Zinni writes: "In the lead up to the Iraq war and its later conduct, I saw at a minimum, true dereliction, negligence and irresponsibility, at worse, lying, incompetence and corruption."   “I think there was dereliction in insufficient forces being put on the ground and fully understanding the military dimensions of the plan. I think there was dereliction in lack of planning,” says Zinni. “The president is owed the finest strategic thinking. He is owed the finest operational planning. He is owed the finest tactical execution on the ground. … He got the latter. He didn’t get the first two.”   Zinni says he blames the Pentagon for what happened. “I blame the civilian leadership of the Pentagon directly. Because if they were given the responsibility, and if this was their war, and by everything that I understand, they promoted it and pushed it - certain elements in there certainly - even to the point of creating their own intelligence to match their needs, then they should bear the responsibility,” he says.   “But regardless of whose responsibility I think it is, somebody has screwed up. And at this level and at this stage, it should be evident to everybody that they've screwed up. And whose heads are rolling on this? That's what bothers me most.”   Adds Zinni: “If you charge me with the responsibility of taking this nation to war, if you charge me with implementing that policy with creating the strategy which convinces me to go to war, and I fail you, then I ought to go.”   More  urlLink here :

      Just read this in the Hollywood Reporter - Looks like the Big 4 networks have caught on to the fact that this is SPIN, not NEWS:  Big Four to pass on Bush speech   The broadcast networks are not expected to carry President Bush's primetime speech tonight, in which he will lay out a "clear strategy" for the future of Iraq. The Bush administration has not requested the Big Four to air live the president's address to an audience at the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle, Penn., scheduled for 8 p.m. EDT on the last Monday of the crucial for the network's ad rates May sweep period. NBC, Fox and ABC will proceed with their scheduled programming for the 8-9 p.m. hour -- an episode of "Fear Factor," the finale of "The Swan" and the broadcast premiere of Oscar-winning "A Beautiful Mind," respectively. NBC and Fox's sibling cable channels, MSNBC and Fox News, will carry the speech. (Nellie Andreeva)

      Great news that Moore's latest documentary, "Fahrenheit 911," has won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival.  Yes, you may have read about this film - it's the one that Michael Eisner at Disney famously (infamously) decided that the Disney-owned Miramax studio COULDN'T release.  You can bet your sweet bippy that another studio will scomp this puppy up, real fast.  Know why?  $.  Moolah.  Profit.  Greenbacks.  Sure, the right isn't gonna like it.  But there are a LOT of voters who aren't reading the anti-Bush books that are all over the best-seller lists.  But they DO go to the movies...

      I can't say enough about how good (and comforting, for those of us on the left) this brand-new radio network is.  They're only broadcasting in a few cities (luckily, NY is one of them), but you can hear it via your computer if you go  urlLink here .   Al Franken - his show is on from noon to 3, EST - is by far my favorite.  I almost got to meet him last year when his book came out - I bought it for bn.com - but I had a nasty bout of bronchitis and was FORBIDDEN by my doctor to schlep into the city to go to a fancy author lunch with him.  Maybe this year, when his follow-up book comes out.  I was able to conduct  urlLink an email interview with him , though...

      It's hard not to think that this is going to (thankfully) cost Mr. Bush his re-election.  Some amazingly tragic pictures are featured (seems like an inappropriate word when used in this context!) in today's Washington Post.   urlLink http://www.washingtonpost.com/   If you can stomach it, check them out, and see how you feel about what's going on over there.

      Took a long lunch today and finally saw the film.  It was devastating, to say the least.  I was amazed at how much footage he'd gathered that I hadn't seen before - I consider myself fairly well-informed on matters anti-Bush.  I think the strength of the film is in awakening us all to the tragedy we're going through on a daily basis.  It offers us a way out, a way to come to our senses.  Seeing footage of the dead and wounded Iraqi civilians was particularly effective - I'd bet most Americans have no idea how many of them we've killed.  It's amazing - even though Moore uses considerable restraint in deliberately not showing the burning/collapsing towers (something which those of us who were here in Manhattan on 9/11 appreciate), just HEARING the sound of the planes hitting (over a black screen) and the immediate reactions of those watching in horror does not fail to bring tears.  Everyone should see this film.

      And you know darn well what "it" is.  I'm definitely feeling the pressure to see F911.  Really wanted to be part of that record-breaking opening weekend, but we had a 40th birthday party for Linda on Saturday and the post-party recovery period yesterday.  Still hoping to catch it this week.  One interesting sidelight to the Moore film is that it seems to be doing well in the "red states" as well as in the no-brainer "blue" ones.  THAT'S a good sign.  And it's supposed to spread to 2000 screens nationwide in a few wweks.  You know how these things work - no matter their own political leanings, once a film shows it can bring in the moolah, film exhibitors will bring it into their own theaters.  Profit motive!  Capitalism!  That ain't good news for W.

      I have to say that I came away from the screening a little disappointed.  It's not a BAD movie in any way, but it just didn't WOW me the way I fully expected it to.  I fully enjoyed the first one, especially Tobey's performance.  And he's fine in the sequel also.  I'm not going to give any of the plot away - you know from the trailer that the new villain is Doc Ock - who's always come off as pretty one-dimensional in the comics.  There's a definite attempt to make DO more sympathetic in the movie, to the extent that you feel that his arms are in control of the man himself.  But some of the stuff he does just goes unexplained.  There are some great action sequences - you see Spidey fighting a lot more in this one than in the first.  But those who complain that Spidey in action looks, at times, a little too CGI-ey, will have some complaint here too.  There's a scene at the end - you know it, it's the standard the-movie's-over-and-now-I-have-to-go-back-on-patrol scene, and it's him jumping a slinging webs, and all that - only this time he's flying around and alongside some police choppers.  And, I'm sorry, it just looks too fake.  There's an action scene that takes place on the side of a building, wherein Aunt May is in jeopardy.  Spidey has to rescue her.  And again, I'm sorry, but that scene had me scratching my head.  In the comics, Aunt May has a notoriously weak heart.  Well, when you see what the old gal goes thru in this scene...  I will definitely see it again - I find that this kind of film usually improves over multiple viewings.  One thing's for sure - 2 definitely sets up 3 - big-time...

      I'm not JUST all about Politics - although my lovely wife might disagree with that self-assessment.  Sometimes, I get to go to advance movie screenings!  Tonight, I'm seeing Spider-Man 2 - will report back tomorrow with a (spoiler-free, of course) review.  Because I can't really go more than a single paragraph without referring to the aforementioned politics (sorry, hon), I hasten to add that I'm planning to see Michael Moore's documentary as soon as humanly possible.  Was hoping to see that before now, but since there's no "companion book" to the movie, there was no publisher for me to harass for a screening pass...

      An ABC News poll tells the story of Bush's dwindling poll numbers on the key issues of the Iraq war and fighting terrorism - areas the Bush camp saw as positives not long ago.  Kerry is basically even with Bush in most areas, which is interesting considering that most voters really don't "know" Kerry yet and haven't formed a strong opinion of him.  Just wait until they discover that he's a decorated WAR HERO - who better to fight (and win) a war on terror?  Was going to link to it here, but the story has mysteriously vanished from the ABC Neww site -  that' s suspicious...

      Yesterday was my second official Father's Day - and I spent it, fittingly, "fathering" my daughter Erin, who got a stomach bug over the weekend.  So even though I had to opt out of a FD dinner for my father-in-law, I spent the day doing what the day commemorates!  We watched Bill Clinton on 60 Minutes last night - couldn't help thinking that if he could have kept it zipped with Monica, we probably would be subjected to the daily horror show that IS the Bush "administration."  If Gore isn't afraid to have Bill campaign with him in 2000, I'm convinced he'd easily have gotten the electoral votes he needed to get in.  And something like 850 soldiers would be alive today, because Gore wouldn't have started a war.  Having said that, I'm glad to read that Kerry has no problems having Clinton campaign for him.  Kerry's going to need all the help he can get...

      Not only will I breathe a huge sigh of relief, but I can start writing about what I really want to write about - the things I used to care about before I got sucked into the world of politics: the Mets, movies, TV shows, graphic novels (OK, comics) and other such relatively trivial subjects.  But it's still five long months to the election, an election we MUST win.  Looking at the front page of today's NY Times makes me feel somewhat optimistic about November.  Despiet their constant lying/distorting about a link between Saddam and Iraq, the BI-partisan 9/11 panel has decisively ruled that out.  Nothing could give me more pleasure while enduring the daily uncomfortable subway ride downtown than seeing this little subhead on that front page:  " urlLink Bush Challenged "

      No, I didn't get to go - unfortunately, but "Fahrenheit 911" had its premiere last night, and one of my heroes, Tom Tomorrow (really Dan Perkins), who draws the great "This Modern World" political strip, was there:  "Went to the premiere last night, along with many fabulous celebrities. Martha Stewart! Leo DiCaprio! Spike Lee! Lots of people you vaguely recognize but aren't sure why! Lots of people you don't recognize at all who are nonetheless apparently very famous! And Bill O'Reilly--and Al Franken! It's true, they were in the same room at the same time--lucky it was a large theatre. I've met Al Franken three or four times, and in situations you'd think he might remember, but each time, I get a completely blank look, so last night I decided not to bother the man as he walked past me. As for O'Reilly, I'm not entirely sure he made it to the end of the film--I saw where he was sitting, but didn't see him after. Pity--I was hoping to ask him if he was ready to renounce the dark side now, because honestly, I don't know how anyone on his side of the fence could sit through that movie and not have at least a little self doubt at the end.   Seats were assigned--I was kind of off in the cheap seats, up in the balcony area. But then again, I was sitting directly behind Kurt Vonnegut, so there you go.   As for the movie itself--I think a lot of people will be surprised by this one. Michael himself is actually not in the film very much at all. There are only two set pieces featuring his usual gonzo wackiness (driving around the Capitol in an ice cream truck reading the Patriot Act over the loudspeaker, for one). There's narration throughout, particularly toward the beginning, but mostly he lets the material speak for itself--and it's strong enough material to shoulder the weight. It's a big film, which tries to cover a lot of ground, but then again, there's a lot of ground to be covered, from the 2000 election to the Bush family's close ties to the Saudis, from footage of U.S. soldiers glibly discussing civilian casualties to extended sequences with a Michigan mother whose son was killed in Iraq (in one scene, some braindead dittohead type in front of the White House tells her she should "blame al Qaeda" for the loss of her son). And there's some gruesome footage of the real cost of war--the image I'm having trouble shaking is that of an Iraqi man holding the corpse of a child accusingly toward the camera. No matter your ideological leanings, any parent--or anyone whose friends have kids, or frankly, any human being with an ounce of decency--has to shudder and feel a little sick about that.  So it's obviously not a film with as many laughs as, say, Roger and Me. You come out of it feeling pretty somber. But it's the right film for this moment, a film inextricably intertwined with the political season. It covers a lot of ground that the media have been too cowardly to cover for the past three years. In his closing remarks after the showing, Michael said he didn't know if it was going to change anyone's mind--but frankly, even if all it does is rally the base, that's a fine thing too. (A personal note on this: some of you may recall that I was collaborating with Michael on an animated film script, a couple of years back. Our financing for that one fell through, and F911 is the movie he made instead. And you know what? It's going to have a greater impact than our sly little animated satire ever would have. Who knows, maybe another year we'll get back to some version of that one--but I think it's better all around that things turned out this way.)  So. You're going to hear a lot of nonsense about Michael Moore over the next few weeks. You're going to read a lot of commentary about this film from people who haven't seen it, and you're going to read nitpicky bullshit from the usual self-appointed fact checkers. Not to mention a lot of truly ignorant bloviation about how much Michael "hates America." My advice is, ignore it all. Go see the movie, decide for yourself. And on the way out, be sure to tell the usher, or the manager if he or she is around, that you appreciate the theatre giving you the opportunity to do so. I suspect this movie's going to be kind of a rallying point--like a protest march, a way of seeing look, we are here, which is partly why the right wing thugs don't want it to be shown."  I can't wait to see it - planning to do so on opening day, which is Friday, June 25th.  Will, of course, report back with a review...

      The UK Daily Telegraph tells us that an "American television network" is set to take this Bush-damagaing story a few notches higher, this very week:  "New evidence that the physical abuse of detainees in Iraq and at Guantanamo Bay was authorised at the top of the Bush administration will emerge in Washington this week, adding further to pressure on the White House.  The Telegraph understands that four confidential Red Cross documents implicating senior Pentagon civilians in the Abu Ghraib scandal have been passed to an American television network, which is preparing to make them public shortly. According to lawyers familiar with the Red Cross reports, they will contradict previous testimony by senior Pentagon officials who have claimed that the abuse in the Abu Ghraib prison was an isolated incident. "There are some extremely damaging documents around, which link senior figures to the abuses," said Scott Horton, the former chairman of the New York Bar Association, who has been advising Pentagon lawyers unhappy at the administration's approach. "The biggest bombs in this case have yet to be dropped." A string of leaked government memos over the past few days has revealed that President George W Bush was advised by Justice Department officials and the White House lawyer, Alberto Gonzalez, that Geneva Conventions on torture did not apply to "unlawful combatants", captured during the war on terror."

      I've been off to Chicago for a long weekend with my wife at the BookExpo America convention - the one with Bill Clinton's speech you may have heard about.  Didn't get to meet Slick Willie, but I'm sure the book will be a blockbuster.  Well, duh.  That's obvious.  By far, the highlight of the weekend was a DC Comics-sponsored dinner with the legendary Alex Ross and his wonderful wife TJ.  Linda and I were positioned right across from them, and the four of us chatted like we were double-dating.  This is the second time I've met them - there was a lunch in his honor I attended last November.  The amazing thing about Alex is how amazingly down-to-earth he is.  I got to see a lot of book folks I haven't seen in years - that was great.  I've been doing this now (book buying) for almost 20 years now, and it's nice to know so many nice people in the industry.  How great is it to do something you love, get well paid for doing it, and you also get to meet nice people?  One thought on Ronald Reagan's death: I wonder how Clinton's death would be reacted to by the right and reported on by the media.  Would the coverage be as fawning?  I suspect not.  Yet Clinton had higher approval numbers than Reagan...

      OK, finally,&nbsp;some thoughts on Comic Con:  San Diego has great weather! It was sunny and warm every day - in fact, I had to buy sunscreen early on, even though I knew I'd be spending most of the three days in the convention center. It was a crazy time to be there - all sorts of big events were taking place at the same time, which meant you couldn't get a hotel room if you didn't book in advance. Some were going for as much as $600 a night - and we're not talking the Ritz! Mine was about five miles north of downtown, which could have been a hassle, except that SD has this great little transit system called The Trolley - I didn't have to take a single cab to get to the show. And the people were very nice as well.  I saw a lot of cool stuff on the floor (but didn't buy too much other than some Alex Ross t-shirts) - including a lot of cool comic-related statues that will probably wind up for sale on the site at some point. Also got to meet tow of my all-time heroes: Stan Lee (Stan the Man), the&nbsp;man behind Marvel Comics, and Brad Bird, who directed one of my all-time favorite films, "The Iron Giant." Of course, when I say meet, I mean I got their autograph. I really didn't say much to Stan other than Hi and Nice to meet you. He said to me as he was signing his name, "It's a nice name, but I'm happy to give it to you." Typical Stan!  I told Brad Bird the honest truth - "I'm 47 and every time I watch The Iron Giant I cry. Thanks for making it." He appreciated it (I think), but was a little embarrassed as well. Oh well. His new film is The Incredibles, from Pixar, which will be yet another monster hit from that studio, judging by the footage I and 4000 other people saw.  Footage I DIDN'T see - which had me pissed as well as many other people - was from next year's new Batman movie. Despite the common knowledge that the trailer is ready, Warner Bros showed nothing. Considering how badly Catwoman is sitting with comix fans, they really should have gone of their way to reassure us that it would be good.  I've been to a lot of cons in my time, but this was the first one where they had 10 or so B-list media stars sitting at tables signing. In some cases, they brought their own glossy photos to sell to attendees. (They're obligated to sign whatever you bring up to them, luckily.) Folks I went to for autographs include:  Gary Graham (Alien Nation) - he told me I should start an online campaign to bring his show back  James Marshall (Twin Peaks)  Erin Gray (Buck Rogers) - always thought she was hot - now she's a still-attractive grandma!  Richard Herd (just about everything, including George's clueless boss)  Marc Singer (V) - he was the Beastmaster!  Dean Haglund (X-Files, Lone Gunman) - he was very friendly, and funny  In all, I had a great time, though I missed my family an awful lot. In a couple of years, maybe I can take Erin along! It's a geek's paradise.

      Though it hasn't made the "major" (read as "corporate") news media outlets, the story is buzzing around the Net that newly installed interim Iraq PM Iyad Allawi has been taking matters into his own hands - way to rule with an iron fist, Mr. Allawi! &nbsp; From Salon.com: &nbsp; "Iraq's interim prime minister Iyad Allawi has vowed to " annihilate " insurgents -- but Australian newspapers have been reporting since last week that Allawi may have gone too far, meting out punishments to suspected insurgents worthy of Saddam Hussein himself.   The  Sydney Morning Herald  reports that Iraq's Human Rights Minister, Bakhtiar Amin, said he would investigate claims that Allawi shot several handcuffed insurgents at point-blank range just before he assumed office three weeks ago. But Amin said he doubted the reports were true: "This is not the Iyad Allawi I know. He's not a killer. And he's not the type of person who goes out killing people. You don't see him carrying weapons."   The Australian foreign affairs minister said nobody his government had spoken to in Iraq knew about the alleged shootings, and another Australian official called on the United States to investigate after the Herald reported that four U.S. security officers were reportedly present during the alleged shootings.    Newsweek  spoke with U.S. officials about this incident as well as another story making the rounds: That Allawi chopped off the hand of a suspected insurgent with an axe. "White House officials dismiss it as 'urban legend.' The Australian newspaper The Age reported last week that two anonymous witnesses saw Allawi shoot seven suspected insurgents as his American bodyguards looked on. Asked by Newsweek if he had killed anyone since taking office, Allawi chuckled and said, 'This is a big lie, this is not true, I deny it categorically, No. 1. No. 2, we will spare no effort to secure our people.'"&nbsp; "

      Busy day today, but just wanted to include this little snippet, courtesy of the very good folks at Salon:  *************************** Uniter, not a divider  John Kerry wasted no time at the NAACP convention today reminding everyone that George W. Bush was the first president since Herbert Hoover who declined to speak before the group. His opening remarks:   "Thank you for that wonderful introduction. I understand that you’ve been having trouble getting some speakers."   "Seriously, thank you for the invitation. Some people may have better things to do, but there’s no place I’d rather be right now than right here in Philadelphia with the NAACP." "As a campaigner, I know a little something about scheduling conflicts and hostile environments. But when you’re president of the United States, you can pretty much say where you want to be. And when you’re president, you need to talk to all the people -- and that’s exactly what I intend to do. I will be a president who truly is a uniter, not one who seeks to divide our nation by race, riches or any other label. You know, the president may be too busy to speak to you now, but I assure you, he’ll have plenty of free time after November 2nd."

      It used to be that incumbent presidents ran for re-election in a dignified way - "from the Rose Garden" is how it was commonly put.  The assumption was that if you were IN the office, you sorta had to act in a dignified manner.  So much for that.  There's a story going around the blogs - yet to be picked up by any of the "major" new media (and probably won't ever be) that Bush gave the finger to two protestors who came out to see him in the little town of East Lampeter, PA (a swing state, mind you!).  It's  urlLink here .  This, combined with the relentlessly negative attack campaign against Kerry/Edwards, and with Dick "Go F Yourself" Cheney's own personal shortcomings, makes this  easily the most nasty ticket yet.  Don't even get me started on Bush's refusal, once again, to address the NAACP - he says it's because some blacks have criticized him.  Right, we can't brook any criticism...

      From Reuters:  July 11, 2004 — WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior House Democratic lawmaker was skeptical on Sunday of a Bush administration idea to obtain the authority to delay the November presidential election in case of an attack by al Qaeda, U.S. counterterrorism officials are looking at an emergency proposal on the legal steps needed to postpone the presidential election in case of such an attack, Newsweek reported on Sunday.  "I think it's excessive based on what we know," said Rep. Jane Harman of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, in a interview on CNN's "Late Edition."  Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge warned last week that Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network want to attack within the United States to try to disrupt the election.  Harman said Ridge's threat warning "was a bust" because it was based on old information.  Newsweek cited unnamed sources who told it that the Department of Homeland Security asked the Justice Department last week to review what legal steps would be needed to delay the vote if an attack occurred on the day before or on election day.  The department was asked to review a letter from DeForest Soaries, chairman of the new U.S. Election Assistance Commission, in which he asked Ridge to ask Congress for the power to put off the election in the event of an attack, Newsweek reported in its issue out on Monday.  The commission was created in 2002 to provide funds to states to replace punch card voting systems and provide other assistance in conducting federal elections.  In his letter, Soaries wrote that while New York's Board of Elections suspended primary elections in New York on the day of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, "the federal government has no agency that has the statutory authority to cancel and reschedule a federal election."  Homeland Security Department spokesman Brian Rochrkasse told the magazine the agency is reviewing the matter "to determine what steps need to be taken to secure the election."  Republican Rep. Christopher Cox of California, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, told CNN that the idea of legislation allowing the election to be postponed was similar to what had already been looked at in terms of how to respond to an attack on Congress.  "These are doomsday scenarios. Nobody expects that they're going to happen," he said. "But we're preparing for all these contingencies now."

      It sure seems as if the only way the GOP-controlled House of Representatives can get what they (and, of course, the White House) wants is to BREAK THE RULES.  You may recall that the arm-twisting they did to get that Medicare reform bill passed (you know, the one where the guy who wanted to reveal the TRUE cost was threatened with termination) ranged all the way to outright BRIBERY (which is, supposedly, being investigated -don't hold your breath, bunkies).  Well, this time, the issue at hand was (finally) trying to rein some of the excesses in the Patriot (hah) Act:  "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-led House bowed to a White House veto threat Thursday and stood by the USA Patriot Act, defeating an effort to block the part of the anti-terrorism law that helps the government investigate people's reading habits.  The effort to defy Bush and bridle the law's powers lost by 210-210, with a majority needed to prevail. The amendment appeared on its way to victory as the roll call's normal 15-minute time limit expired, but Republican leaders kept the vote open for about 20 more minutes as they persuaded about 10 Republicans who initially supported the provision to change their votes.  The measure had been pushed by a coalition of Democrats and conservative Republicans. But they fell short in a showdown that came just four months before an election in which the conduct of the fight against terrorism will be on the political agenda.  Besides successfully fending off the effort to weaken the law, the veto threat underscored the administration's determination to strike an aggressive stance on law enforcement and terrorism.  The House has voted before to block portions of the nearly three-year-old law, but Congress has never succeeded in rolling back any of it. Yet neither has Bush succeeded in his quest to expand some of its powers."  You should be OUTRAGED.

      OK, here's today's big news headline:  "RIDGE: Al-Queda Plotting Strike No specific threat; alert status unchanged" (USA Today)  Is it just me, or do these vague, unspecified threats always seem to pop up just when the polls turn sharply against the Appointed-Resident-In-Chief?  Nothing like instilling a little frantic fear in the minds of the electorate to stop the ratings slide.  This, from the man who SWORE he wouldn't use terrorism as a political weapon.  Yeah, right.

      This is the best pick JFK2 could have made.  Will help him in the South, plus the press loves Edwards, which should affect the way they cover Kerry himself.  My only reservation is that Edwards might be somewhat loathe to attack Bush/Cheney the way Cheney has been doing all along.  I guess we'll see...

      When I'm not wearing my political hat, I've usually got my "Geek Gear" on - I not only buy graphic novels for bn.com, but we're also starting to dabble in those expensive comic-related collectibles items you see at comic shops like Forbidden Planet.  We've purchased some Spider-Man product, to tie-in to the sequel, and we've even bought some Catwoman items, despite the less-than-favorable buzz the Halle Berry film has gotten thus far.  So as a by-product of that, I'm attending the big San Diego Comic Con in a few weeks!  Those who've known me for a while know that I've been to a lot of comic book conventions in my early years.  But never did I think that I'd get PAID to go to one!  It should be pretty cool.  I'll definitely report on it when I get back.  Let geekdom reign, as W might ineptly say...

      Interesting new headline on CNN.com this morn:  "U.S. leak 'harms al Qaeda sting'  ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- The effort by U.S. officials to justify raising the terror alert level last week may have shut down an important source of information that has already led to a series of al Qaeda arrests, Pakistani intelligence sources have said.  Until U.S. officials leaked the arrest of Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan to reporters, Pakistan had been using him in a sting operation to track down al Qaeda operatives around the world, the sources said.  In background briefings with journalists last week, unnamed U.S. government officials said it was the capture of Khan that provided the information that led Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge to announce a higher terror alert level.  Khan is a computer expert who officials said helped Osama bin Laden communicate with his terror network.  Investigators found detailed surveillance information on certain targets in the United States, apparently conducted by al Qaeda operatives, on Khan's computer disks.  The unnamed U.S. officials leaked Khan's name along with confirmation that most of the surveillance data was three or four years old, arguing that its age was irrelevant because al Qaeda planned attacks so far in advance.  Law enforcement sources said some of the intelligence gleaned from the arrests of Khan and others gave phone numbers and e-mail addresses that the FBI and other agencies were using to try to track down any al Qaeda operatives in the United States. Then on Friday, after Khan's name was revealed, government sources told CNN that counterterrorism officials had seen a drop in intercepted communications among suspected terrorists. Officials used Sunday's talk shows to defend last week's heightened alerts, amid widespread claims the White House disclosed Khan's arrest to justify raising its terror alert level.  But some observers have said that Islamabad should not have been compromised by political considerations in Washington. "  Tell me again WHO'S "tough on terror?"  Ugh!

      Thought of a great new Kerry campaign sticker on the subway this morning:  BUSH/FEAR 2004  Because it's pretty freaking obvious that the Bushies intend to issue scare warnings every time they deem it politically useful. For those of us who work in Lower Manhattan, it's clear that the intent is not to protect us, but to frighten Tom Ridge makes a big deal out of intelligence threats that were received BEFORE 9/11, a fact he conveniently forgot to mention at his front-page news-making press conference. He didn't forget, though, to make sure we all knew that the reason we had this info was because of Bush's "leadership."  Yeah, right.  Now he's claiming that the Department of Homeland Security doesn't play politics.  Uh huh.
