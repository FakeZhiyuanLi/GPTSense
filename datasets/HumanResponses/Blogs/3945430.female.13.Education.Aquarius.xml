       Ok so today I went to the pool with Ashley and Molly was there so we hung out with her and then we were at the snack bar and it started raining! We ran under one of those big red and white umbrellas and took shelter there.&nbsp; Then Ashley realized that our stuff was still on the hill in the rain so we ran to get that then we got ready and called my mom from the payphone to come and get us.&nbsp; Then we went to my house and we played Mario Party 5 and we won I think!! So that was my exciting day!&nbsp; We already dropped Ashley off at her house again so now I'm just lounging around! I am so excited for tomorrow!! I can't wait to drive a go-kart in the parade!! And then me and Ashley will probly hang out, maybe even go on the rides but my parents don't like us going on the rides cuz they're old and rickety but they're still fun!! I think theres fireworks too!! And theres the art show on the bluff and I always like getting my face painted and stuff!! Maybe this year my parents will even let me go on the helicopter ride!! Its like a tour of Port but you're up in the helicopter!! The only bad thing is that it costs like 50 dollars!! But it would be soooooooo fun!! So I'll talk to you later!! Bye!!

      Ok I've made many a blog before but I promise to stick with this one!! Soooo... I'm going to be in the Fish Day parade tomorrow!!! And I get to drive a go-kart!!! I'm so happy!! Today I'm going to the pool with Ashley and I wanna work on my tan!! My back is pretty tan cuz I fell asleep at the pool and my back got sunburned so today I'm definitely wearing sunscreen! Well, I wore sunscreen last time but I don't think it was strong enough so yeah!! I got a good book from the library yesterday called Leslie's Journal which is where I got my diary title from if you can't tell!! OMG my fav song is playing!! It's 50 Cent "Patiently Waiting" well.. at least its my favorite rap song oh and I like "Jesus Walks" by Kanye West!! Those two are my favorite rap songs! So if you read this please leave a comment cuz I wanna see how many ppl actually read this darn thing! So I'm gonna go now.. TTYL!!!!
