       urlLink COMEDY CENTRAL TV Shows%3A The Daily Show with Jon Stewart   Why is it that the only reliable source of news on television today is The Daily Show with John Stewart?  Is network news asleep or scared?  Why is it that the fake news is more reliable and more informative than the real news?  American's have learned more about their government in the last year from John Stewart and Michael Moore than Tom Browkaw, Dan Rather and Peter Jennings combined.    There is more news on TV today than at any other time in our history.  There is more news media than in any other time in our history.  And yet they continually get it wrong, continually fail to ask real hardball questions and always seem to be looking in the wrong direction.  Do journalists go to the same schools as the CIA?  What is there to be afraid of in reporting the truth?  Has media and corporate consolidation gotten to the point where criticism of anyone in government or power will immediately feel the governments or some other unseen force's wrath.  Are large corporate interests so intertwined with positions of government power that they are indistinguishable?  NBC is owned by General Electric, which holds numerous government contracts, has major defense contracts and is dependent on government for those contracts and makes more money in climates of war than peace.  Thus, does criticizing the Bush Administration and its treatment of the war in Iraq affect NBC's financial bottom line? Of course it does.  If Michael Eisner, the boss of Disney - ABC, releases Fahrenheit 911 or lets Peter Jennings report real news, what happens to the tax breaks of Disney in Florida under governor Jeb BUSH.  Itâ€™s obvious.  It's gotten to the point where I only use the Internet for getting my news.  Google news is the best to me because it receives its news feeds from all over the world, from independent, non-mega corporation sources, from the US and abroad.  It's perspective is much more global than network news or any major American newspaper.  It picks up the columns of Internet crackpots and wire services.  It gives the little guy a voice in a market flooded with mega-media drivel.  When was the last time Network news really caught a politician in a lie FIRST, and actually reported it, and when I say report it I mean the equivalent amount of airtime they spend on Michael Jackson stories.  John Stewart does it every night.

       urlLink Michael Moore Home Page   Michael Moore may have pulled a few cheap stunts in some of his previous movies.  But I have yet to hear anyone, anywhere disprove any of the facts in Fahrenheit 9/11.  The reason being they can't.  It's easier for the W Stormtroopers to just ignore it and hope Moore will fade away.  Yes he is one sided, but not more than Rush and O'Reily.    There are lots of Columnists and Internet Political Pundits that say F911 is a pack of lies and doesn't contain a shread of truth.  But I have yet to hear one of them say "here this specific fact is wrong and this is why."

      I'm a man of strong opinions, originating from unique places, living in the Suburbia of our nations capitol.  I've never been the type to live big and shout it out in the walking talking everyday world that we all live in, but like to think that I live very large in the online world... anonymously .  I plan on Blogging it all: W, the Democrats, D.C., Suburbia, Kansas - Yes Kansas, Sports and whatever else I damn well feel like.  Today is a brand new day and I am back in the game.
