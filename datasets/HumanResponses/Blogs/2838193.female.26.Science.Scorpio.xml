      Yesterday I discovered that my future kids and husband probably won't be considered Iranians :( Isn't that a shame!? By the laws of The Islamic republic of Iran, children born to Iranian women, married to non-Iranian men are not citizens of Iran... that's sad. Ok, so my melting point till now is like this:  -I am an Iranian. Ok, just look at me :) anyway, Iranian parents. We have still house and family in Iran. I read and write in Farsi and whatever happens Iran will be MY country. -I am a British citizen because I was born in England: in fact I am here in the States with my British passport (makes VISA processing much easier ;) ). Ok, I lived in England only a couple of years, before my parents decided patriotically to go back to Iran because there was a revolution going on! -I am a permanent resident of Italy: lived there since I was 12...even though I don't have the Italian citizenship, I still feel a lot Italian and I love Italy. -Ok, I have been living and studying in the States for last couple of years or so, but I won't ever feel to become an American. -My BF/fiance' is French, so if the things go like this, I will become probably also French in a while (from there to speak French well, it will be still a long walk!). It may sound funny, but besides all the problems of Iran, I love it still very much and discovering that my kids won't be considered Iranians, well, hurts a bit. I mean, the other day we will talking with Tiger (of course if I am the tigress, HE is the Tiger), and he was saying that the future kids will learn first Farsi and French and then all other languages. :( Well, it is sad...

      I feel like a dumby... Ok, I admit it I have no idea about how to post stuff on internet and I am trying to learn. I know, it is stupid stuff for lots of people out there, but it is so nice when things work... Che bello: the comments box now works... Happy tigress! (ok, tigress is my other name-besides gufona I mean- Have to ask my BF how come he comes up with nicknames only from the animal kingdom!).

      I just finished cleaning the car from all the snow of last week. Tonight we will need it to go play v-ball and B-ball. I have been missing V-ball really for a long while (basically since 2 summers ago when I had the first problems with my ankle)... When last week I went playing once again, I really understood how much I love playing this game... Yeah, volleyball!!!!!!

      In questi ultimi due anno e mezzo, ovvero da quando sono venuta negli USA, il mio Italiano e' peggiorato tanto che mi dicono sembro Striscia La Beriscia. Che vergogna! :( Magari se scrivo in Italiano qui...hmmm, chissa'.

      I have always loved owls. My mom says that my first words have been "joghdeh" (In Farsi: "owl"). During years I have ended up having a lot of owls around (couple of peluches, necklaces, charms, calendars, paper weights,...), so I guess it came kind of natural to my boyfriend to give as one of his first gifts to me a white owl peluche (particularly cute!). He begin to call "him" GUFONE...and after a while said also that I looked  a lot like GUFONE, hence, GUFONA. As he says, me and Gufone have almost the same nose (referring to my very Iranian nose!).

      It is one of those days that I feel just like sitting down and crying, going for a walk somewhere where nobody can find me and hide from everything, especially myself. I am angry and frustrated and completely mad at the whole world. Nothing works, nobody cares about fixing a damn thing if they don't have to and what the hell, I am so damned fed up with feeling on my shoulders all the pressure... I am gonna explode (or implode) soon....

      I was already dressed and prepared to leave for work when it struck! So, I spent the whole morning in the bed till 1pm when Tiger came back home...As I thought he did marvels at his Comps and the committee was happy and he can even graduate by the end of the year. He is just amazing :) Anyway, I spent even the afternoon in the bed till almost 5pm. There is somebody that calls but doesn't leave any message on the answering machine... just serves always to wake me up completely. I just hope that by tomorrow the pain in gone. Please, please, please... It is just so debilitating...destroyed my whole day and left me almost dead. Not even with high fever I have ever felt so bad...

      A whole afternoon spent with people trying to put together the new lab is scratching sandpaper on your soul... Anyway, we did it and it is almost finished. We just need to bring the new probe station and computer/heater exchange station downstairs. The high note of it all? We are putting together the last pieces (connecting the various computers and monitors and LCR meters, etc. ) and Junbo shows up with a sample in his hand asking what we have down with the probe station. Man, I have sent an email, telling everyone about the works going on. You don't show up to help...fine, but do you even expect us to put everything back together in record time just for you!?!?! Some people have the power to drive me nuts just by being themselves!

      Damn it.... Ok, so Raja calls me to have a look at the old RTA because he and Ravi have tried yesterday to fix it but have not been able. So I go upstairs and check and yes, there is this tiny red light for overheating on.  "Oh my,...but then the water line is closed". Ha...well, open it and wooooooooooooosh! I am soaked up in a jet of H2O, because somebody has disconnected the water line to the RTA without leaving a note or anything for other people not to open the water!!!!! Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.... A soaked tigress is extremely dangerous...they tend to be almost MAD!!!!!!

      :) H. (don't know if he wants to be cited, so I keep just the initial) said that I am lucky to speak many languages. I agree, but I can also think of many weird and funny situations I have got myself into because of my stupid brain that continues to mix and match the words from the different languages. When we first moved to Italy, I knew nothing of Italian but I used to speak a very basic English (avvale-eh Rahnamaii...and no, I never went to private teacher/school for any of the languages!). So I was still learning the language, but for some funny short-circuit in my brain I couldn't get myself to remember the right word for "chaman" (Farsi)/ "Grass" (English) ("Prato" in Italian)... not that I could even say the Farsi for it (not that saying it in Farsi would have been of any use...). Well, in these fantastic occasions (yes, has happened more than once), I would transpose the English of it into an Italianized "Grasso', which means "fat"... Try to imagine the face of people when talking to them about his/her well-kept backyard "fat"!!!!

      ...is basically damning urself to be disappointed everytime. It is funny how any person who didn't know cooking had turned into a "pizzaiolo" and/or has an "Italian restaurant". I know this and still, when it came lunch time, I went to this "so Italian" place, because our group goes usually to lunch all together. Anyway... I haven't been to this place for at least a year and I have forgotten that they almost dip their subs in OIL! By the time I finished my first half of the sub and picked up the second half, it was dripping oil... I had to damp it with the napkins.  And while I was busy with this, Ravi reminded me of the "Noon barbari" that a friend (Malaysian) has got for me from DC recently. How could I continue to eat the sub while my mind was racing with images of Noon va kabab? Aaaaaaaaaaah, I want some good Iranian food...  Considering that my Iranian recipes don't include noon va kabob (ok, the kabob I actually can manage...but the bread, no way!!!), I have just to stop thinking about it... Maybe I'd better think about some good Italian food...maybe I can make something nice for dinner tonight. Lasagn, perhaps?! Tiger loves my lasagna...

      I really don't like cleaning. I guess I will never be a good housekeeper: in fact, at home, it is the Tiger who is also the Cleaning Bug... (Ok, so I choose the nicknames from the animal kingdom too, so what?!) Ah, but I was talking about the cleaning. Today we have been cleaning for the n-th time one of the labs because we need to change the layout of the room in order to accommodate a new and bigger probe station. Why people can not keep their stuff in order I wonder? If everybody would just put his/her own stuff in the right place and clean, there won't be need to go into so much trouble everytime something like this comes up. Umph....

      I was reading the headlines of The Iranian (www.iranian.com) and found myself thinking about a single snapshot-memory I have: In Tehran, we lived/live very very close to Meydun-e Mohseni (Meydan-e Madar) and even though at that time I was probably just somewhere around 2 years old, I remember being in the streets, on the shoulders of my dad. I remember we were standing on the north-western side of the Square, where there used to be a bank and there were all these people around us and everywhere else. Bahar, my elder sister (just 4 days short of one year older!) has the same scene in her memories.  The impressionable minds of children!!!  As far as I know, this is actually the oldest memory of my entire life... ... Free association of ideas: I was now thinking about the different times that we had Pasdaran coming into my house and taking my dad or mom with them. And that time that they took all of us, including my baby sister in my moms arms to whatever Prison for interrogations. I remember that they made me and Bahar sit in a separate car than my parents. I remember one of the two guys in the front sit of the car saying: " You two are very good girls. You don't even cry." and Bahar: "Why? Do you hurt kids?" and the Pasdar: "Oh, no, the Pasdar are good." and Bahar: "So, you promise that you won't hurt my parents?"... And then he was silent and I was really scared because he won't answer till he said: "If they haven't done anything,nobody will hurt them", but he wasn't smiling anymore... I also remember that later on, they were asking us the names of our friends, but they wanted their last names and we had no clue...  The bliss of not-knowing...

      Tiger has his Comps exam the day after tomorrow... I am as nervous as he is not. He is just sitting there with the calm of a frozen fish (thanks god not as stinky!) and I am always running around with my stomach in a grip. Isn't he amazing? I wish I could manage it as well when it comes my turn of taking the Comps!

      I always follow the news of Iran, but as happens, every time that any kind of elections are close-by, I feel more and more involved...  Now, I was reading that because of Khameni's "hokm", the elections are going to be held anyway on the  first day of Esfand.  urlLink   If it makes me, leaving outside Iran, so nervous that people's and people's representatives' opinions are so not cared for, how really depressing and/or nerve-breaking it should be for people who live inside Iran?!

      I am so fed up with these headaches. Yesterday, once again, I lost all the afternoon because of this excruciating pain. After the CAT scan and the MRI scans showed nothing, I should have been supposedly happy. Don't get me wrong.. I am happy that I don't have anything "so bad" that would have shown up in the scans, but at the same time, not knowing what I have is not nice at all... Hmph...

      The elections were yesterday. I was following up the new on  urlLink Sobhaneh  ... Well, even thought the final results will still take some more days before being known, already both of the sides (reformists and conservatives) declare victory. The conservatives are at this point  urlLink only 36 seats short of the majority . The reformists consider the relatively low turn-out (around 43%) a sign of the people's support. Don't want to be in Iran right now... feel already enough frustrated with it over here, imagine if I was still living there.

      I thought I was going to die yesterday... So, I got from bed, did my morning routine: bathroom, exercise, cuddling the Tiger, and then I felt the headache coming. It's just I have this thing about the needles and I wasn't really happy about this Imitrex self-Injection thing that the neurologist has suggested on Monday. So I spend 5minutes thinking it over and by this time the headache is galloping closer and closer, so finally I decide that after all, I will just feel a puncture for 5seconds and then the headache will be over: yes, I will be brave. So I stick it in my upper tight and wait those prescribed 5seconds, but from the first instant I feel something is wrong. I have this horrible pain that spreads from the injection site up my leg. The next second I am already feeling dizzy and can't keep my eyes open, my chest is heavy, have problems breathing. I end up in this nightmare with everything dark and crazy, somewhere just full of pain and sadness and I am crying like crazy: don't want to stay here. I struggle, harder...and finally I can open my eyes again: have no clue where I am. Then I hear Tiger's voice "Breath Amore Mio. Please, breath" and I remember...and I feel the pain again. It was stronger than me and I couldn't do anything but shout and cry. Poor my Tiger, he was so scared... I was scared too, but I was fighting, fighting to breath. 20 minutes of iperventilation, sweating and getting rocked in O.'s arms and I was just crying because I could finally let myself go. And I cried, because I was relieved.

      ...it also seems that my leadership skills are getting high scores recently. The Department has asked me to be the Student Leader representative to the Alumni Graduate School Association Whatever (...which is basically a dress-up lunch with the wealthy alumni to discuss our programs.) My advisor, being on sabbatical, has asked me to be the group representative at the Grad School Open House, for recruiting new grad students...

      Another Monday morning meeting at 8am!!!!! My advisor has recently decided that I am the most time-conscious person in the group, therefore everytime something comes up with her and she can not keep the schedule, moves me to the early time slot for the weekly meetings! Grrr, sometimes, I really think I should work more on my Iranian-Italian side and be a bit more careless about timing. Maybe she will change idea and put somebody else in the early time-slot!

      I have been happily working in the office since almost 11am today. It is 6:30 on Saturday evening and I have had just an hour something of break: just enough to go home, cook a fresh mixed vegetables sauce and make some fettuccine to eat, eat and sit down for 10 minutes before coming back to the lab. Wow, I have completely lost the sense of the "week" as those 5 days from Monday to Friday. I don't mind working on weekends per se: it is more quite and the experiments have less noise while collecting data. Usually everything works better during weekends. It is just the feeling that U have no time really left for urself.  My adviser once told me that U know U have become a really good researcher when U R thinking about ur research under the shower. Right now, I am thinking about my research not only under the shower but also while eating, watching TV or sitting at the theatre watching La Boheme :)) The first act has just concluded and the Tiger asks me "So, what do U think?"... "I was thinking that I could use some of the epitaxial films of Takeshi to see...", ops, I look at the Tiger and he is laughing at me" I meant about the singers!". Nice, huh?! Ok, back to work, need to finish analyzing these data before I leave "work": I have two more full sets to do at home ;)

      So La Boheme was nice :) Actually I Liked much more the opera in itself than its representation yesterday. The singers were not as good as I hoped. But I got goosebumps anyway with the "Che gelida manina..." Musetta and Mimi were kind of average, but Rudolfo was actually good... Now I am looking forward to Othello and Sound of Music. I am very very excited for this latter. I guess all the guys of my age more or less that had a video in Iran know pretty well "AShk-ha va labkhand-ha". I have seen it in at least 3 different languages and I always love it the same. It is part of my childhood as much as the "gojeh sabz" (green prunes)... so it is really exciting to see the "original" Broadway show that was the basis for the screen version of it. Considering that it is in April, U will hear me talk about that again ;)

      Tonight we are going to see "La Boheme". L'Opera Verdi Europa is in tourne in the State for the second time and they are stopping at Penn state :)  I am happy and excited, even though I have this guilty feeling. The one U have when U have lots of things to do, but U r so tired that ur eyes hurt and ur arm gets a cramp with the mouse clasped in ur grip ;) So, I kind of feel guilty to leave all the work and go to the opera. Still, I guess it comes from my Iranian education that school comes first. Also, we have bought the tickets from the beginning of the season and it has been sold-out for a while now, so I would feel guilty if I stay at work and don't go. Imagine all the people that would have liked to go and can not... Will tell U tomorrow if and how much I liked it...

      The guys, while cleaning one of the computers in the lab, found a presentation file by Q. on the material I work on. Just to make the case, when I arrived here, Q. & Q. have been working on the processing of my material for some time, considering that their role has been that of synthesists. Anyway, the guys show me the file and the process steps are  SO DIFFERENT  from what they had given to me! It is completely crazy. They have told me A and I see written B!!!! Unbelievable... I have to talk to Susan about this. Ok for personal likes or dislikes towards other members of the group, but afterall, if somebody is part of your group, it is in your own best interest to have a good reputation for everyone. What they did is just plain and pure backstabbing. I mean there shouldn't be any place for such a dishonesty in the scientific research...not at this level. They made me lose my entire first year because the samples wouldn't get out right!!! Now my modified process is so much like their "old/original" one... Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr (Ok, I was being the Tigress. A Gufona can not make any proper sound in this case!)

      Hey, today is sunny again and the snow that came down yesterday has already molten :D  I feel always a bit happier when the sun is out and shining... Happier but not less tired: working in the sol-gel lab makes me feel so drowsy and sleepy. All this morning I have been working there and I have also this weird taste in my mouth even after lunch! I wonder if it happens to other people also to associate taste to colors (well, besides in the case of chocolate!). I remember that when I was a kid, I bit once on an orange pencil and it tastes sour and bitter (daaaaaaaaaa!). Still now, everytime, I see as vibrant an orange as that pencil, I feel this sour taste in my mouth and for some reason I get goosebumps. Anyway, today I have this red-orangy sweater and I feel that this weird taste in my mouth is kind of connected to that.

      Barb says that after I call home, I glow :) I called home today. Everybody is doing fine. Roshy has an exam tomorrow and my mom is trying to go to Iran for two weeks, maybe leaving even next Monday so she can be back by NoRooz. I miss them so much... Today at the WaffleShoppe while waiting for lunch, there was this lady sitting at the table close to us that had something about her that reminded me so much of my grandma. She has that air of dignity and charm, you know, mixed with the small gestures that you see more in elder people. I miss her also. I miss waking up earlier than anybody else in the house, so I could wait for her at the window. I would spot her and waive at her, so she wouldn't need to ring the doorbell and wake everybody else. How nice was waiting in the line with her to get milk in those early mornings before going to school... she would chit-chat with me and tickle me on the way and then treat me as a grwon-up eveytime somebody else was around. I just would love to have her close by right now, so I could hug her and leave a huge kiss on her cheek.

      Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan, I am so dead! Not dead in the same way as last week, but tired dead... As Last Monday, I have been here since 8am for the Monday morning meeting and have been running all day long "multi-tasking" :) I have been literally juggling between X-ray lab, Sputtering tool, Dielectric Measurement lab, my desk and computer and preparing samples for the various experiments. Ioanna is giving a party at her place tonight, but I am soooooo tired I guess I won't be able to go. We even need grocery shopping. Goodness! Still another half an hour before I'll be able to setup the last experiment and leave for home.

      I am really freaking out now. I know, it is crazy, the Comps is not but in more than a month and I already feel my legs shaking! What is wrong with me?! Calm down and live in the moment...CARPE DIEM! That's what I have to do... be a bit more self-confident... right.... :)

      Yuhah! The introduction paragraph is done: 2 pages something. Plus already written almost a page on sample prep and characterization. Now comes all the toughest part of explaining things that seem kind of obvious to you to everybody else in a clear, concise and scientifically correct way! Argh.... Deep breath and let's try... "May the Force be with U!" I mean "ME" ;)

      Oh we had a wonderful time last night. Can you imagine anyone not having a wonderful time with a couple of nice friends, great food and THREE bottles of GREAT  Bordeaux Wine  (the two reds were from the Tiger's private collection, respectively 9 and 10 years old! Yes, he has begun early collecting good wine ;) )?!?! Ok, I admit I had my reserves on the food, but they turned out to be just awesome. Began with the appetizer: small baguette slices with pate' de canard and the side of mixed olives and sundried tomatoes and a bottle of white wine (don't ask me the denomination, I have no clue!). Then a "bla bla" with a mixed green and tomato salad on the side and rosemary-olive oil bread. Oven roasted potatoes with the two main dishes (some kind of game bird in mushroom sauce and another kind of sausage and meat with lima beans and gravy sauce). Concluding with two kind of cheese. The main courses running down with the excellent red Bordeaux. For dessert a whole 8-portions size Tiramisu (with rhum instead of Marsala!) and a marble cake.  :))  By midnight (yes, we got off the table after 2 hours or so!), the Tiger has decided that it was time to play darts. Can you imagine four very tired and happily drunk people playing darts ina contest of Materials Science against Electrical Engineers? Unfortunately MS lost both the games even with the help of the opposite team member Yuyen that insisted in hitting the door where the board was fixed instead of the board itself :) Steve had one of his good nights, hitting the Bull's Eye basically upon whim! (He was behind with the scores and we found out that he needed 8 reds and 1 green BE to win: he won! Can U believe that?! He is never so good just when he drinks just beer ;) ) Anyway it was fun but by 1am we were all dead, so they went home and... and I have to say this one: Tiger cleaned and washed everything before coming to bed!!!!!! He has decided that he was taking care of really everything and that I shouldn't worry. Isn't that sweat of him. No wonder I love him so much ;)

      I realized that I shouldn't be so negative! So I am trying to find the positive things of today.... Hmmmmm..... Oh yeah: Ioanna brought me a dark chocolate bar directly from Russia (ok, I don't understand Russian, but in very very small Latin characters at some point there is Nestle' written! Hmmm). GOOD CHOCOLATE! What else? Oh yes, tonight Steve and Yuyen are coming for dinner and we are having French food. Ok, Tiger is not really going to cook! His brother and sister in law have given us for Xristmass a huge basket of goodies (of course the Pate' de Fois Gras is already gone together with the 1995 bottle of Sauternes long long ago). Now we have still some pate' and other stuff (don't ask me to repeat the names) and he is supposed to take care of "cooking" or at least making them presentable for the dinner. Steve is making some tiramisu' (ah, the wonderful side of having a friend with an Italian mother. Modestly my tiramisu' is better, but hey, if I don't have to do it, isn't it much better!?). So I have virtually nothing to do... and I say virtually, because I don't know what will happen with this French stuff ;) Just in case I have enough ground beef in the fridge, carrots, onions, garlic, celery and tomatoes to make a good enough pasta sauce to serve with some nice Barilla fettuccine ;) I am too Italian with my pasta! As much as I am not a "meat and beef" person, I am a "pasta" one. Atkinson? Get lost! :)) Hey, I was just thinking that already I feel better: back to writing the written report now! So people out there, take example. Smile and the world will smile back to you! :)

      I have been all morning with Bill on the RTA system. This deceitful thing had the face of working when Bill was here, right after he reconnected the water lines. As soon as I come back and re-put back everything in its place, I make a last dummy run: U know just for the sake of saying "it is done!". Turns out it isn't done: it wasn't working. Not even turning it off and on made the trick. So re-open all the hundred pieces and screws and ...hey it seem sthat there are some lines with absolutely no water running through!!!! Hallelujah what a magnificent instrument: never works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now I can't even get Bill to work on it till Monday cause he is working in the Nanofab. Just wonderful. And the weather is gloomy too: I want the sun back. But at least the forecast says....wait a minute, the forecast actually says rain, snow showers and flurries. Hey why everything is turning wrong?!?!?

      I have been really busy today or I would have written this one earlier. Ravi comes into the office today and his first word is: "scary", and I am like:"what?!?".  "You hair is scary!".... :? How amazing! I mean, ok, this morning I washed my hair and I came running to the office (because I was late, dah!) with my hair still all wet. So they have been curling, considering also the extra humidity due to the rain (humidity 100% is one of the worst things in the world. Well maybe except in hot-climate regions I guess!). Now, considering the gentle nature of Ravi...ehm, maybe I should say the USUAL gentle nature of Ravi, his comment was not felt so negatively by me (how nice of me!). The only thing was going to Barb (Barb is our group's ...I would say secretary, but hre title is staff assistant and she is officially our MOM) and complain. And we concluded that there are three things a guy should  NEVER  make a negative comment about to any woman: weight/body, makeup and hair! (For brunette and red heads there is a fourth thing: intelligence!)

      :)) I usually have a healthy diet (not that I am on a diet/"regime", I mean just the way I eat!) and I go regularly to the gym and as often as happens play volleyball. But I am a "choco-holic" and there is no way to go around it. So today when I went to lunch with Ioanna, my lunch couldn't have been more unbalanced: -mixed green, red cabbage, julliene carrots and olives; -chocolate chip cookie; -oatmeal+raisin cookie; -super Ghirardelli chocolate brownie. Ok, I shared the cc cookie with Ioanna and left half of the or cookie + the brownie for the Tiger. But, still, U should have seen the face of the girl at the register ;)) Anybody that knows Irving's bakery goodies will understand me!!!!!!! U should also consider that I need the sugar to make my brain work!!!!

      that's the title of a song in Italian. The singer who wrote the song was describing the emotions she was feeling right behind the curtains of the most famous song festival of Italy ( urlLink SANREMO ) while waiting to perform. [Actually right this week, the 54th edition of the festival is going on!] Anyway, I feel really confused and happy, trying to get this work done. I was just checking back some new data and I saw that they fall into the same region of the best samples ever produced in out group, even thought the values differ from my own first experiments. So, confused, because they are not exactly what I expected them to be, but happy, because I have some very good theories as for the why... Going back to analyze more data now ;)

      The white page is mocking me... I haven't still begin writing. Damn, I have the writer's block from the first page! Ok, so I have written down in notes all the future work, I have two drafts for the nonlinearity part and the processing, but nothing  real , which is bad...very bad. WRITE! Right... like if I order myself to write it works....

      and all my good purposes are gone with the wind. I haven't still written a single world for my progress report. Ok, I have been electroding some samples and finding out figures, tables and graphs that I need. Programmed servicing jobs on an instrument and tried to schedule some runs for the new samples, but still nothing written. BTW, I found out that the report is supposed to be 5 to 10 pages long! :)) My last summer's report to Susan was 12 pages by itself and it was only focusing on the characterization w/o any processing. I guess I can "exceed" at least up to 15 pages w/o being lashed by the committee. Poor things have to read it!!!!

      I have already been through the "ready" and "steady", so now with the "go" of my advisor today, I am beginning to prepare the written report for my comprehensive. I usually get the writer's block after a while. So, considering that I have 3 weeks to go, I should be fine. If/when it happens, I should have still enough time to recollect myself and be ready by the deadline. I will also have to schedule a group meeting to rehearse with the guys my talk. Of course Susan can't be present, but then that makes it easier to organize for the meeting, considering her busy schedule. Some times I wonder how she manages to take care of everything and be always the best. I mean, she has even two small kids and this semester she is also on sabbatical in UMD, which means that she is here only on Mondays. I remember that to that question, she answered once: "You do it"...and then she added "and if U marry a professional musician it helps a lot ;) ". Tiger is not a professional musician, so... :))

      Yes, ok, I completely forgot about Billy crystal: he was good. Delivers always as expected (which maybe is one of the reasons everything went so smooth!). Nice comments about the "Texas National Guard that let's me come and go whenever I like" and "13 years ago everything was so different: Bush was president; economy was tanking and we have just finished the war in Iraq". Read a nice review  urlLink here  from BBC.

      My gosh how boring was the Academy Awards Ceremony last night. After a while it was obvious that everytime Lord of the Rings was nominated, it was going to win the prize for that category. The actors also were all well-behaved. The only out of tone was Sean Penn with "everybody knows that the WMDs don't exist", or something like that. Shohreh Aghdashloo didn't win, maybe not to embarrass all the press for not being able to pronounce correctly her name (did I spell it right, BTW?). Well, that's how much was worth mentioning. Let's get back to work...

      Haven't done really anything this afternoon, well, besides yawning. I am so dead asleep. This morning I had another meeting at 8am with Susan and recently it seems that I really lack a good night of sleep.  Anyway, I finally received this afternoon my teaching certificate from the Graduate School. It actually looks pretty nice and comes in a dark blue folder with golden engravings: kind of cool. It is even decent enough to be framed and hanged on the office wall...well, if it was really worth something ;) I am really falling asleep on the top of the computer... should go home and get a nice nap. Yes, I should... I should, right?!

      Geez, I am in one of my shopping moods. I know that sooner or later I will end up again in Victoria's Secret shop and spend a lot of money. State College is a hole of a place for shopping. Ok, so we have a Nittany Mall, but it is a pretty poor depressing place for anybody who has lived in a city. So there are literally three places to go shopping at in SC...

      My mom called this morning from Iran. She was with my grandma and my grand-aunts, so I got to talk to all of them. It was so nice to hear their voices...my, they are all in their late seventies and eighties, but they are well and running. My grandma still drives around Tehran in her old Pykan and nothing to complain about her (maybe besides the fact that she doesn't go more than 50Km/h: ever!). My grand-aunts still live in this old house close to Tupkhuneh, which used to be the downtown when they were kids and they were living there with their parents. It has 4 or 5 floors, and it is pretty big, but right now, they use only the first two floors and they have this relatively big internal court with a small but tall "hoze" in the center. I remember that it had always this greenish color to it, but a couple of time, it has got clean and Bahar and me could use it as a mini swimming pool when we were 4 and 5 yrs old. My grandma moved when she got married and she still lives in her house by her own. I could almost imagine all of them on the old bed and sofa close to the phone to talk and listen. I  miss them...

      Hmmmm, I am beginning to be really a bit too superstitious, but the truth is that every time the sun goes away the nice things happen less and less. Imagine my disappointment to discover that the pyrometer on the RTA is not working. I mean, the system works, but only in the thermocouple mode. Which is much better than if it wasn't working at all, at least now I don't have Susan and Srini (he is a member of my committee, but also co-advisor with Susan of two people in the group) breathing fire on my neck. :)) Hehehehe, I was just thinking about two dragons with Susan and Srini's faces... ;) Everytime, I write here, I get a bit relaxed, I find back my smile, and it makes it easier to continue to work... That's nice, isn't it?! I went back today to my report and added a summary chapter/paragraph at the very beginning... I know it sounds weird to put a summary at the beginning, but it is a bit like and abstract only longer. Couldn't really think of a better name for it...On less, I call the summary introduction and the introduction background... may work... I almost thought I saw a ray of sunlight ;)

      The RTA is working. Would U believe it?! I am happy! And the sun is out and shining, the sky is blue and I can finally go back and concentrate on my written report. I realized this morning that I have exactly one month left! I am gonna work harder (I have already heard this one :P ) and I am gonna do well... Last night was fun... I played awfully, well, beside a combo and a pocket that made Tiger clean the table at the next turn, but hey, who cares, as long as we all had fun. Djamel was even getting so much into it to make tricks with the ball and doing jumps...ok, they were not exactly intentional, but still ;) I even came to work, walking from home all the way and with this beautiful weather, walking half an hour just felt grrrrrrrrrrrreat. Now I have to go back to the RTA and put the covers back on, re-screw all the 287 (no, they are not really 287 :P It just it sounds good to write down a random number like that to say they are MANY!) screws and then make another test run to make sure everything is in proper order. :)

      I am still at the office, working on this report. It is tough...so, I guess I am taking more breaks than I should. Anyway, tonight we are going out with some friends, playing pools, drinking a beer and probably eating even some not very healthy food. A propos, Tom's daughter has been selling girl scout cookies and now in our office we have 5 boxes of them. And that's not good at all: the hands just go toward the cookie box and before I know, I have eaten more than I should had. Ha, I closed the box and put it away far from easy hand reach. I had brought with me the CD of  urlLink Calogero  to listen to, but Ioanna borrowed it. So I am even working w/o the music in the background. When I am writing I prefer to have some music in the BG, but when I study, I can not stand any sound. Hmmm, I guess I will just get some Italian radio from the WEB.

      I was so tired this morning. I woke up at 6:30 (my biological clock is set 10 minutes before what would be my getting-up-time) and I felt so tired that I decided I could skip the morning exercise and stay in bed just half an hour more. Then at 7 I thought "whatever, I can even skip the morning coffee and run to work w/o it". Next thing I know is waking up and finding out it is 8:45 :P Tiger was even more tired than me, so he hadn't just got through all the mystical thoughts about what to skip and be on time. So, he prepared the breakfast, while I was checking our emails (how come the advisors, even when in sabbatical, need to talk to U at very early hours only on the days U r late?!?). One of the simple pleasures of life is to have breakfast w/o having to think how late U r going to be... Ahhhh... So now I am working on my report here at home (even though I don't have all the reference articles with me, I am going to work on "results and discussion") and it is so nice. The living room is just so full of sunshine (I just wrote it down and a cloud covered the sun! Isn't it just amazing?!)...ehm... and the blue sky with the fluffy white clouds, the green grass and the budding trees (hey, the sun is back! :D ) It is all so lovely... One of those days just perfect for daydreaming and even if U have to work, U have that stupid smile on ur face.  I was reading  urlLink Hossein 's last entry and I thought that I feel a bit like that myself right now: maybe it is just that I feel a bit relaxed! My, not being tired and having a nice breakfast make such a huge difference ;) With my still smug smile, I am going back to work.

      The morning spent to repair the RTA (unsuccessful, even though I got bunch of awful stuff out of it!), the afternoon to get the probe station to work (also unsuccessful: it is almost enough to breath on the sample to lose contact, let apart having Raja jumping and stumping around to see if it would really lose contact! Daaaa!). Therefore another day gone by and I am still at the "sample prep and characterization" paragraph. Shoot... Ops, I just remembered that I need to call the Tech Support people for the RTA: they are in CA, so if I don't call them now, tomorrow morning is gone again! Later.

      ...U should leave them stay for a while and cool down. U can always try later on! Some example of nice advice that I can never apply personally! The list of things that haven't worked since this morning: -my optical wireless mouse is making happy jumps and time to time I wonder if instead of a mouse, it could be a mule, considering its stubbornness to move; -I tried to make some measurements for my written report. U know, working at home this W/E I had a few ideas and I wanted to try them out. Well, no way to get decent contacts on my samples. The dielectric losses dance happily all around the digits and it is just frustrating to see how the sample shows to eb at the same time dielectric and shorted; -so I said let's go back to the RTA and adjust that: well, Bill had to leave early (11am) and got caught for almost a whole hour at the phone with some wanna-be-trained. So RTA is still semi-dead...unconscious definitely, I would say comatose! -then I though I should check just to see if I have any viruses on the computer. Turns out that the LiveUpDate wouldn't update for some transmission problem. Of course the computer technician is not here today so whatever... -finally my samples from UMD arrive, so I try to deposit the Pt electrodes: the Pt target is finished, so no way! -last but not least I am sitting at my desk, trying to convince my beautiful laptop to collaborate with the LiveUpDate when my necklace just falls down: the lock spring is broken. I mean come on... it is just not fair!!!! ... Hmmmmm....Let's try to do the "smile" thing again, maybe it works ;) Ok, right now, I seem completely nuts. Sitting alone in the office and laughing to myself :)) W nutty/naughty mad scientists (and mad wanna-be-scientists ;) )

      I was just reflecting on the words of Mola and I lost myself in the gloomy sky out of my window. Is it too much nostalgia to feel for a 26 year old woman/girl (I am still too childish to be really just a woman!) who has visited Iran last time 5 years ago? Iran is not nostalgia to me, it is a place of memories and life. A place connected to with all my five sense. It is Damavand that I could see from my parents bedroom window (till they begin to build all around apartments!), it is the clear sky of a summer night sleeping on the porch of a village close to Delijan, it is going to school all clad up and playing in the summer afternoons with my friends on the street. It is talking with my grandma and grandaunts, while cuddling on the sofa and listening to the funny anecdotes from when they were teaching at school. It is making snowmen in Tehran and swimming under the hot sun in the cold swimming pool in Karaj. Reading on the swing all the books that my parents had in their library while eating grapes. Laying down under the summer sky with my sisters and hoping to see shooting stars while thinking about our futures. Is coming back every summer and seeing something different and feeling a bit more alienated from the people on the streets of Tehran and just as U have never been away with ur old friends. It is following the news on internet newspapers and suffering all the injustices from a distance. It is walking on the streets of Hamedan and having people ask my dad if his family were actually American tourists, laughing back and talking to them in Farsi. Is having somebody U don't know getting a taxi and run after U in the middle of the night on a scary road to give U ur bag, containing passports, money and jewels. It is many other people, that U don't remember the names, but remember their smiles, people that would invite U in their house or offer U a tea after they have known U for only half an hour. It is beautiful mountains, vast deserts and blue sea. It is all this and much more: where else could be the same? Where else keeps all those memories and all those wonders. Good or bad memories (I know, I have let myself go and left almost only the good ones!), it is still Iran: still 10 years of my life, people I know and others I want to know. I don't say nostalgic...the word has a "giving up" mood in it. I just recognize it is part of me, whatever happens.  All this said, I feel in part Italian, but in a completely different way, probably just because I have been living another stage of my life in Italy and therefore I am connected to it by different strands of memory and personality. I just know that I am neither one nor the other completely, even though both Iran and Italy are parts of me.

      We had just bought he new bed set and were getting back to the car when it began to rain! I love that first smell of rain on the dry earth (ok, not so dry after all that snow for almost four weeks! But still with the sun of the last days pretty dry!). It was a deja-veaux. It reminded me of Iran and the late summer afternoons in the garden in Karaj when the heat would begin to calm down and mom and dad would water the front porch and U could smell the earth just wet... I miss it. My memories of Iran are so interwoven with memories of childhood and memories of holidays that sometimes I wonder if I love Iran so much just because of this. But I really don't think so, otherwise it should be the same for my sisters too. My parents say always that I have had this particular attachment to Iran. I know that I love the earth of Iran, the landscapes, and especially the real people of Iran. It is just part of me and I can not do without it, ever.

      I was reading once again Hossein's  urlLink blog . His  urlLink last pos t of the conservative culture in Iran is so well said. Especially I agree with what he has written in his  urlLink Farsi blog . Homosexuality has been part of the ancient cultures, from Plato and epicureans in Greace and Saadi and Ghabus in Middle East upwards (my timeline of Persian and Greek cultures are kind of separated due to the fact that I have studied one in Iran and the other in Italy without references to eachother. Bottom line, I am ignorant!). And if you look closer, both in the western and eastern cultures, the rejection of homosexuality has been due to religion (even in cristianity, consider the way they call it only sodomy and reject it with some of the lectures of the Scripts). In Iran the whole sexuality is a very "hush, hush" thing. Let apart that in the last decade the youth have picked up a certain openness but still even among the younger generation, homosexuality is seen as something weird and not so tolerated. The interesting part of it is that U see the same thing even here in the States, in this small college town in the middle of Pennsylvania. The more the religious background of these college kids and the more intolerant they are in confront of homosexuality, and this even when they are relatively open in straight sexual relations. Personally, I don't think that the sexual orientation should be considered any different than any other physical characteristic in a person.

      I deam every night and I almost always remember what I have been dreaming about. And last night's was  weird even though probably not the worst ever. This morning I could remember it all but right now, I have only this images about flying sharks in Karaj's swimming pool and dolphins that had lots of eggs in their mouth, sharing a room  in a dorm with Elena, an Italian girl I met in England from high school times...  It is kind of bugging me know, because I remember that before all these, there was a very nightmarish part cause I woke up at 2am and had to ask tiger to hug me, cause I was almost scared to close my eyes and have the same nightmare again. And the more I try to remember that part of it, the more my memory becomes fuzzy... Hmmmmm...

      Here actually it's 7pm and everything is fine. I wanted to go to the gym this evening but I am so dead, fine but dead. It has been a pretty long working day. I guess I will begin writing again tomorrow for the frequency dependence of the parameters tomorrow. Besides everything else, I have had this weird feeling in my left ear. I feel like in a ghost story, or at least some scary SciFi one: I can hear the beat of my blood vessels (not all of them!!!! Just the one close to the ear!!!) with a background sound that's like the one U hear when U put a seashell to ur ear. Isn't that weird? Tiger has been telling me that happens and that it will go away soon, but ... Should go home anyway, 11hours a day in the office is too much even for me!

      I am still working on this frequency dependence thing of my data. It is maybe more complicated than I thought and right now I am beginning to wonder how did I get myself in such a mess. It is such a huge, wild territory (yes, Wild West kind of) that the committe can get me when and where they want. Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeelp... I continue to switch between logarithmic and power law dependencies and this is still data analysis god help me when it gets to writing it down in a comprehensible way!

      Mola, you are right, it is not only Iranian men that have middle age crisis. Maybe what was really fastidious to me was the way the Iranians I have met, those with middle age crisis have behaved. Maybe it is due to the fact that sexual harassment is something that most people in "this side" of the world are aware of and think twice before doing anything that could be considered inappropriate. On the other hand, some Iranians have this macho background of loud appreciation (think of "matalak" for example) that is kind of part of them. A man has many ways of showing the "admiration" for a woman. Small gestures could mean as much as many words without being disrespectful (and viceversa). I am not sure if I have made myself a bit more clear, but what I have been trying to say is between a compliment and being inappropriate (from embarrassing loud appreciation to laying hands on someone) there is clear line, that in my case, I have seen only Iranian men pass, regardless of their being "normal guys" on the street, college students or a professor I know.  ... I apologize for the generalization once again, I still don't mean that all Iranian men behave in this way and no other man of other nationalities behaves in this way. I have met many Iranian gentlemen also ;) Furthermoe, the examples on "what kind of guys" is more due to the fact that many Iranian people still consider their level of "education"  being directly related to their social and cultural level, which is not exactly true.

      I thought that 17 of March was Barb's birthday (last week she brought in bagels for everyone and I remembered something like 21st of M to be her birthday and she says no, it is because I finished this portfolio thing for this upgrade stuff I am doing. So I ask her then when it is and she say 17. But she meant the deadline for the portfolio not her birthday! Da...!!!!). Anyway, considering that I thought that yesterday was 17 and today 18 but that I haven't come to work yesterday, I just bought a super dark chocolate cake with raspberry filling and white chocolate shaving (yummy) and brought it to work and then discovered that I have screwed up twice! But the cake was good and all the people in the group appreciated the treat ;)

      I just freaked myself out of my wits!!!! For the last two day and till now I have been missing one day. I mean I though today was Thursday 18th!!!! I discovered it by chance while reading on the web and everything was dated Wed. 17th. So I check my computer: Wed 17th again.  I ran to Barb and asked her what day it was and the omnious answer was Wednesday 17th. Shoot, I am really stressed then. Goodness... I still can't believe it.

      really! It has been snowign since this morning early and it has stopped only for 10-15 minutes around 2pm. I have stayed home today, once again, to work on this report. I tought that I was almost done yesterday, but when I was going to bed, I just remembered that I was missing all the frequency dependence part. Shoot! So, another morning went by, because I saw that part of the data I had were not completely analyzed. Hmmm, not very good but still some progress was done (this is once again me trying to be positive!). I don't know why but with the snow, weird stuff come to my mind. I was thinking about my ex-BF  A.  (Chain of thoughts: Snow, I want to be in a warm place, we R going to Houston at the end of April, summer, Spain, my ex-BF who has been living in Spain for the last year or so with his new Spanish GF). When we broke up we decided to be coll and keep in touch and be friends. It worked well enough for the first year, then we met during the Xristmass holidays and he messed up and became a bit too friendly, then apologies and all the rest and once again we are cool and friends, after that the friendship with  T.  developed into something more and he finds a job with Siemens in Barcelona and he begins to be weird. His emails become very formal, detached, boring. He basically tells be it is better if we don't keep in touch anymore. I say fine and don't write to him anymore. All this time he has kept in touch with my little sister and once she asked me "so, how is he doing? and me"what do I know? U probably have more news" and I tell her that he basically has told me not to contact him again. So she writes back to me a couple of days later and says "I asked him and he says that he never said or intended anything like that". Whatever...In fact he writes me after that and "U misunderstood and I am fine, etc. etc.". Next thing the holidays come up once again and I tell him when me and Tiger will be home and if he wants we can meet and he says "thanx but no thanx, but T. Won't like it" !??!!?!? Whatever again. So I was in Italy and talking with my little sister comes out this little conversation and she says that he is weird and I said that cause he didn't want to meet I wasn't going to call him. A couple of days later,I was out for something and he calls and my mom asks if he wants to talk to Roshy, but he says that he wanted to talk to me and he'll be calling later. In fact he calls later and he is all nice and fine. We chat for a while and after the talk he sends an SMS saying how nice was talking again and bla bla bla. So I answer back saying if wants to come around one these days and get a tea. He answers a couple of hours later and says "sure, I haven't seen all of U for a while" ?! So he came over for a couple of hours and we all sat the table (my mom and sisters included!! :) my sisters called him fracellino, which was a mixture of small brother and his last name), everything nice and sweet. Later on, he comes out with an SMS like, "yeah, I though maybe I would hurt T's feelings but then she was fine with us meeting so I came over". Ok, I hadn't written to him since Xristmass, cause I didn't want him to hurt her and anybody else. After Madrid's attacks I wrote to him, just to say hi and see that everything was fine. Now he answers back with a very formal email like I was his (I don't know even his what...) lawyer maybe?! It seems that he has this periodical mood swings and I am a bit out of my wits on how to take him. Somebody tell me what's wrong with this man...or with me!

      It is nice when U r working well and U don't realize that the time has been passing. I realized that it has passed some time, because I finished to listen to 3CDs (Enya, Dying Young's soundtrack and Born by Bond). So, I was sitting here and listening again to the music of Bond and looking outside of the window at the slanted rays of sunlight in the backyard when once again I felt that the spring was here...but for once I really don't feel the Nooroz at all. In Italy, it was always me preparing the Haft Seen and even here in the last two year I have kept up with it, even though sometimes I have been in real trouble finding all the seven of them. This year nothing... I don't know, maybe it is because this year I haven't even kept the contact with the Iranians here at PSU. Don't get me wrong, they are mostly nice people, but they have this close-society feeling about them that makes you feel an outsider or something. Maybe it is the gossiping that goes around and is so typical of the small societies of the immigrants. I don't know... It is just a long story and here may not be the best place to get it out otherwise it will become gossip again, right?! ;)

      Ha, interesting, without realizing it I wrote the title in Italian (Today). I guess it is because I was thinking of home...the one in Italy. It is funny how my concept of home is so subject to where I am at the moment. Home is time by time, our house in Iran (even if it happens that more and more often, I refer to it as house than as home), our house in Italy or our place here in SC. I always miss one of the ones I am not at that particular moment. When I am here, I miss my home in Italy and when I am there for holidays, I miss our home here in the State. Maybe that's because the home in Italy is associated with my family and the home here is associated with me and Tiger. He is family now anyway ;) My goodness, this free association of ideas is funny. I thought I was going to say something about today and look where  ended up... So, today I stayed home once more to work on my report. I can concentrate better here, U know, once again, a lot of sun light,, nice soft music, nobody disturbing (ok, every now and then a telemarketer) and I can use the whole dining table to displace all the reference articles. Yes, I am really messy when I write. Especially these scientific writings, when U have to read and proof read and correct and read again and then delete and re-write so many times. That's why I love to take a break and write a couple of lines here on the blog. I write basically whatever comes to my mind and don't worry even about how I write it. No proof reading, sometimes not even spellcheck. Of course, when later on I happen to read some of the old posts, discover lots of orthographic and grammar errors, but then who cares. I like to capture the essence of that moment. Carpe diem has been always my best motto and I guess it will be still for a while ;) My mind rambles at the rhythm of "after the rain" of Othmar Liebert (good example of I have no idea if I wrote it right down) and "Ney nava"... Spring is in the air, isn't it? Even though they forecast snow for tomorrow and Wednesday. I am going back to work...

      What a nice evening the last one. Well, besides the fact that when we arrived at 8:40 at the Gamble Mill, they told us that on week days they close the kitchen at 8!!!!! So, we decided to go to The Victorian Manor in Lemont and imagine what: the same story about week day! WE really rushed back to state College and get to Zola's, which at least stops getting reservations at 9:30!!! The bad side of leaving in a small town is that there is really not much that can be done by the whim of the will. But the company was wonderful, the food delicious and the wine nice enough that we ended having lots of fun! Today I even went to work early and had a nice surprise in discovering that I have been assigned a long talk for the ONR conference in May! :)) Happy tigress (ok I know that the name of the blog is Gufona, but the owls don't really convey the image of happiness, while a tigress can always purr or jump and play! Therefore I am a happy Tigress or a moody Gufona depending on the mood)! If I just could have the talk with Susan today about my written report it would be just perfect!

      Not that actually I have done really a lot, but I feel kind of drained. I guess it is just one of those mental conditions. Again, it is not tiredness, U know, it is just that feeling, that time has in part flied past ur eyes and part kind of hung in front of ur eyes without moving.  I was o stressed that this afternoon I realized I have been sitting like a turtle in her shell, my shoulders were way up and my head way stuck inside my neck. Naturally, I was creaking all when I tried to move a bit. Ahhhh, man.... Anyway, I spent almost all of the afternoon discussing my written report with Raja. He has worked for almost two years with Damjanovic in Switzerland on this stuff and as Susan has put it, maybe knows more that the rest of committee about it! So, we had this discussion and it seems that whenever he had doubts I was able to convince him of what I believed. Still, it's better if I can sit down with Susan and discuss it tomorrow morning. Sometimes I really think that this work is eating me from inside out. Happens every now and then that I realize I haven't really done much else besides thinking about my research. I mean, when U realize while hanging out with a nice group of friends on a Saturday night that U have been thinking for the last couple of minutes about ur research...well, it's bad, isn't it? Relax, I tell myself and two seconds later I realize I have ended up in the turtle position again.  Breath in, breath out.... Relax... Almost...  We are going to The Mill in Bellefonte tonight. It's Ioanna's B-day and so we are going to celebrate at The Mill. Actually none of us has ever been there, but they say (even the Europeans) that the food is really good. I say the Europeans because usually the Americans call "good food" something with lots of fat, cheap and big portions ;) We'll see...

      Don't U hate it when U send emails to people and ask them specifically for an answer (even stupid stuff like "R U coming?") and they never answer back? Specially when their holding back causes a lot of organizational trouble? Let's take the example of this stupid group lunch for tomorrow. Barb's and Ioanna B-day is this week, so we talk it over and I send out the email to say we are going all out to lunch on Friday at this place, this hour, PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF U R COMING TO MAKE THE REVERVATION...bla bla... Can u believe NOBODY replied to the email? Not even one person that would come over to my office and say "oh, I am coming"! Well, yesterday I had enough of it and while asking people (when I would meet them in the corridors) if there were coming or not (and of course everybody was!!!) I let drop that if they were not too many people, actually we may end up going somewhere else cause this other one would have been our first choice if it hasn't been that they can not accommodate a large group... The end result: I had somebody running in the rain after me to come say they were coming on Friday!!! How long does it really take to click on "reply" button, write "I am coming" and hit the "Send"?!

Nothing can be done about it and it can take up to 6weeks to heal.

Well, well, well...  Now I can go and read Metin's whole thesis (Susan thought that she remembered Metin doing some freq measurements for his thesis and that I should have a look at it, so we can take a couple of hours on Friday and discuss it! I naturally freaked out after discovering that the only reference to time-dependence in the thesis was 2 pages as long as I could see and it would be no basis for a two hour discussion! So now I am reading it all, just in case :P ) ... Maybe I will fall asleep on the couch. Zzzzzzzzzz...

      First of all, I am a dreamer: day dreamer and night dreamer both. And I love to dream...and as long as U are allowing urself to dream, imagining things that are not real, why not go for the best of it?! Ambitious? Maybe...but why not? Why not dream big? Because maybe you won't ever get it? Maybe that dream won't ever come true and U will get frustrated? Hell no...I dream even bigger. Aim higher and be content even if U get less. That's the secret.  If U ask my friends in Italy they will tell U that they owe me a red Ferrari...well, as soon as I get my driver license anyway!!! ;) Ask my friends here and they will tell U about the "project" of having the jaguar for everyday and the ferrari for the weekend. Well, Ferrari and a cute old Rolls Royce with ebony dashboard ;) Why not? Ok, unless I win the lottery that won't happen, (Tiger or his parents are not billioners, so no hope on that side either!) so what?! Wouldn't dreaming bring at least a smile to ur face?! :) So dream and hold on to ur dreams...who knows, they may become true.

      My motto for today is: "It is never too early to get your first chocolate of the day"... ;) If u know what I mean... Today I got up at 7 and while I was getting ready to go to work, Tiger asked me if I wanted to wait a bit longer and then we could walk to work together... :) How sweet, sure... Yeah, he got up from bed at 8!!!!!! So I had plenty of time and not that much to do, I ended up doing a couple more morning exercises and taking a bit more care of what I was going to put on. That's how I got to be "fashionably correct" as Barb put it five minutes ago :)) The earrings match the shirt and the makeup too...  And with a comment like that, I feel a bit too fashionably stupid now!

      ...about how I ended up doing what I am doing! It was the last year of my studies in Italy and while shopping around for a professor with whom to work for my thesis, I have let drop that I liked to go for a PhD in the States. On day, my last semester so it was probably March, one of my professors while passing him in the corridors stops me and asks me if I am still interested in the PhD in USA and I am "oh, sure"...and he says that he knows someone in Penn State that is looking for somebody that already knows something about sol-gel. Penn State? And where is that? Never heard of before! So I go home and do my nice research on internet and yes, it comes up that PSU is ranked in the top ten for Materials Science and Engineering. Not bad but best of all, the deadline for application submission is in April, so they are the only School in the top ten to have it still open. So I think "whatever, what I am going to lose? I have anyway to wait till next Xristmass to apply for any other school". A couple of e-mails exchanged with the future advisor later on, a month spent  preparing three major exams, TOEFL and GRE done while working all the rest of my time on my thesis (that at this point had to be complete by July), some correspondence with Grad School and department administrative Staff, and I ended up, exactly two weeks after my defense in Italy, at Penn State with a nice assistantship and even a greater advisor. Sometimes, I think I am really lucky ;)

      ...advisor of mine amazes me once again.  I had just this (I thought) stupid question to ask her why this thing behaves like this... No she went up with two works published in similar fields but not quite, linked it to my work, came up with one of her theories that she usually accompanies with "now, right on top of my head, consider that it is just a theory, etc. etc. " and I was sitting there and I think listening to her with my mouth wide open. She is just amazing. No wonder that the university hired her as soon as she finished her PhD (nonetheless from Penn State itself..all contrary to univ and department policies), at 36yrs old she was already a full professor and she is the best teacher in the whole department and that everybody has such a huge respect for her. Sometimes I really think I am so so (and many more so-s) lucky to work with her.

      Literally referring to my student account with the university! Saturday I received a bill to pay for the amount of $113. Today I checked on line and the insurance has paid almost all of my health bills to the university and now I have a positive balance for the amount of $112!!! Isn't that nice that the university owes me something!? ;) Hopefully the insurance will soon pay also the MRI scan stuff...

      I kind of feel I have a lot to say but I can't quite find the end of the thread to open the mess of thoughts in my mind.  So a new Year is here. Spring is blooming with the gusts of 28mph and the rainy days. Sure, right now looks a bit depressing more than anything else... :) I love this: as soon as I write something like this, a wonderful ray of sunshine comes out of the clouds and everything is brilliant. No, I didn't go the Norooz Celebration this year, no I didn't even call anybody else but my parents, nor I sent out email, cards or letters. Right, very rude of me, but at least rude is better than hypocrite. (Hmmmm, I have still to think this one over! I don't like to be either rude or hypocrite!!!). No, I didn't even stay up to celebrate it (I just woke up in the middle of the night, realized that it was "saaal tahvil" said "Happy Norooz My love", he said "Happy new year to U too Amore Mio" and we both went back to sleep!), no Haft Seen, no programmed wonderful things to do... No, not any of these. But as it turned out, we woke up late enough that we decided it would be nice to go out for brunch to The Waffle Shoppe and in the middle of getting changed, calling my parents and all the rest, Steve called to see if we wanted to join him and Yuyen to go to TWS ;) Amazing... So we spend the whole morning (or what was left of it) to laugh and talk and eat at TWS, went grocery shopping and then even some real shopping. At then end of the day it also happened that we decided to go watch "In America" (BTW, it is a really nice movie!I loved it!) with them, Sean, Eve and Bernd, go to get a drink/dessert/anything to eat after that and go to bed at one something am! And yes, I felt sick for half of the day even thinking of how sweet was the breakfast (just yogurt, granola, fresh strawberries and blueberries...but even if I have asked for no honey, it was swimming in it!) and I ended up spending a lot at the different shopping stores and I received even the bill for the MRI scans (some two thousand dollars, that I still hope that the insurance will pay!)...but hey, I am still here and alive. I know, all the stuff I wrote doesn't make much sense, but I never said that I found the thread! ;) I am not even worrying about finding it here... And while "Il mio solo pensiero pensiero sei tu" is filling the room and the first snow flakes are falling, I think I am going  back to work on my report... Seize the day and enjoy your life... (and no, I am not charging anyone for the pearls of wisdom I give ;) )

      I think I will stick to my 89%... If I take off the calibration, the results are completely screwed up, if I leave them in, they are not even similar to anyother instruments... So I guess I will just put them in an extra slide...U know, the ones that U show only if they ask U that specific question ;) talking about the scientific honesty... Ok, it is not really dis-honest, it is just that it is like giving them the gun to shoot me if I present something that doesn't reproduce perfectly my results (it does, the problem is that it does it only partially! I know why it does not and that's it!). I have still to finish the damn report... It's like walking in a circle, the Moebius ring, one of Escher's works: nightmarishly endless!

      Oh Je suis fantastique! I just spent the whole afternoon making this mega check on my model, which if works is going to take the validity of my theory from 89% to 99.5%. Imagine what...at the end of everything I find out that the data I have been trying to simulate are actually triple corrected for these factors my model doesn't consider!!!!!!!! DAH! Now I have to go back and redo everything... What a beautiful world! (no, of course I am not being sarcastic!).

      The problem of working in a lab like ours is that U have thousands of electrical interferences.  I guess that is one of the reasons my brain is not working properly!!!!

      *Yesterday evening we went grocery shopping. When we came back I found a message on the answering machine. Guess who? SUSAN!!!! This is just crazy... I mean I felt guilty that I was neither at work nor at home. What kind of a sick Grad student syndrome is this?! So I called her back and got the answering machine for the cell phone :P Now, it was her turn to feel guilty! :)) She was the most apologetic I have ever heard of her...she has afterall disturbed me at home ;) The instrument in MD was giving weird responses and they were not sure if it was due to my samples or to the instrument! Well, not my samples!!! They are very well-behaved, cute, little samples... They won't dare behave badly even if I am not present!!! ;P  *As for today, I finished my poster for the Materials day in April. Even if we are going to be in Huston on April 22nd, I had still to prepare the poster. Actually what I did was just updating the ones from the MRS Boston of last fall. Didn't really have time to go and do a brand new one ;)  * I have still to finish with some of the suggestions Susan had on my written report. The ones like, "make some suggestions about the use of the model" and "if possible, add...". That if possible, of course is possible: it will take me two days of bibliographic search but it is possible. Will have to hand out the report to the committee member on Monday. Damn, I haven't still opened a single book from the courses I had taken this past two years!!! I am beginning to have panic attacks again... As a ex. of the disastrous state of my stressed mind: I have recently begun to mix words when talking. Interesting examples "I don't know if to take mish" (no, I don't mean game, but...) meaning "I don't know if to take meat or fish". "I have been tittling, laking,..."-->"I have been listening, talking,...". Even thought I don't make usually sense either, recently, I make even less sense and I am worried not to have this kind of celebral disfunction during my oral exam. It's funny when U r with friends and they stare at like U have beginning to speak Farsi out of the blue or they just burst out laughing when they see that u are confused too, but it is definitely too embarrassing when U do it in front of the ur doctoral committee. Makes U feel kind of an idiot!

      *I am working again at home today... Spent almost all the morning creating a mini-movie with MS-OFFICE drawing tools! Yes, when U have grown up with Office, happens that U make the mini-movies with its drawing tools. I actually love drawing, so I don't mind it even in these stupid terms.  *As it was mostly predictable, everytime that I decide to work at home, my advisor needs me in the office... an email this morning as soon as I checked the email and later she has even called on the phone. Of course the guys called me as soon as they got off the phone with her. So, at the end everything went smoothly. I mean, she doesn't ask us to keep office hours. It is more fastidious to me... it seems that everytime that I am never at work.  * Last night we went to the Nittany Valley Symphony concert: Symphony n8 (opus 93) of Beethoven and Piano concert n@ Opus 83 of Brahms. I particularly loved the Allegro Appassionato of Brahms', especially the sections where the strings where leading. :P I admit to have had goosebumps a couple of times. We have talked about going, but when I came home, I was so tired that I tried to convince Tiger not to go, but he has already told Andres, his group mate that we were going. So went and over there we found even Bernd, KK and Corey. We went even for ice-cream and milkshakes at the end.  *It was funny that at least three members of the orchestra were married to faculty people in MATSE. Maybe my advisor was right: the best way to handle carrier and family is to marry a professional musician!!! The percentage of married to musicians is definitely higher than the percentage of married to people with other carriers. Remarkably among the male professors, there is a huge percentage of un-married, married and divorced or multiple marriages, almost as high as the ones married to a Wife (by this I only mean that their wives have no other way to be categorized!).   * BTW, why every time I look for an article on internet from home, I found out that it is not available in electronic format? Today two out of three were not vailable on-line >:( Hmph!

      Thanks to all of U who sent their congratulations... It feels funny to get all these best wishes months after we got engaged.  I mean the story between me and Tiger has been going on now for two years almost exactly. And I say almost exactly cause neither of us remembers the precise day, which is perfect, so we have a month-long-anniversary (we KNOW that it should have been somewhen between March21st and April 21st!) Anyway, we kind of knew from the beginning that we were meant for eachother. But it was kind of crazy because Tiger was in the process of finishing writing and defending his Masters with already some 2-3 job offerings in Europe. So, when he came out one day with "U know, this is a bit unfair. I have been trying to finish ASAP so I could go back to Europe and now I am in love with U and I have to stay here." (In my mind: "I didn't ask u to stay. I knew U would leave....hey, wait a second, what did U say? Love me? U r gonna stay?") Anyway, two months after our first kiss we moved in together in this lovely little house, he has finished his Masters and he has found a PhD position with a new incoming professor in his exact field of interest; a month later I was on holiday with him and his parents (they postponed their "O.'s graduation trip" cause I had a conference right after that and otherwise I wouldn't have been able to go with them). Looking back I sometimes wonder how did everything worked out so perfectly. I guess that is another example of my being lucky! Anyway, he was already talking about our future home with the fireplace, the backyard, the front garden, our four kids (I said HE... I am trying to keep it down to two, max three. But he can be very convincing...). My mom tried every now and then to convince us to get married anyway (yes, she was confused over her own very Iranian culture and her very free-spirited ways) and then gave up, stopped loving my ex-BF and accepted Tiger... and that Xristmass, some 6-7 months later, after meeting him, she loved Tiger as her new son ;) We have always talked about everything very openly to eachother, so one day he just asked me to marry him, I hugged him and said yes. And he said he was sorry he wasn't one of those that would surprise me one day with a ring and ask me to marry him. He was not sure he could chose a nice ring by himself. What about buying it together?  Yes, we went looking for "our ring" together in Boston. And at the end, he kneeled and gave me the ring, repeating the question. The best part? we did't tell anyone...not our friends, nor our families. Of course Barb and my advisor noticed the ring first. Word of mouth after that among friends. Our families, saw it a month later when we went back home (ten days in Italy, ten days in France!)...U should have seen their faces ;) ...now I have something else to smile all day long for: lots of nice memories...  Thanks all of U for the congratulations, U just put the smile on my face :)

      Apart from the fact that Goodmorning Vietnam is a great movie and that Robin Williams is one of my favorite actors, what a good morning today. I guess everytime I stay in bed a bit longer than usual I feel it is going to be a good day ;) Nothing crazy, I was at work by 9:15.  Susan has finished to review my written report yesterday and had left it on my desk. She has really reduced the abstract to minimum, but for the rest it is was mostly advice, like "don't put this in. It's dangerous" or "expect questions from Clive here". And then there is this paragraph that U see has put HER ina lot of trouble. There are a couple of beginnings for corrections, later wiped out and then a question mark, which has been barred later and at the end of the paragraph finally a single word"good". :)) I passed this morning making corrections and adjustments to the written report and oral presentation slides. I had in program to finish my taxes but that will have to wait till this afternoon I guess. Talking about taxes: the stupid bursar office has send my refund check to my home address in Italy! I can't just believe this...The funny part is that they have sent the check yesterday and today they inform me about the refund and say that U can decide if U want it posted to U or direct deposit in ur back account! DaaaaH... U have already sent it, what difference it makes now to say where I would have preferred it. "Oltre al danno la beffa" (Besides the harm made they made also fun of me!). The sun has almost vanished and the clouds are reigning in the sky, hope at least it doesn't rain till after lunch. I am walking downtown to have lunch with my Tiger ;)

      How would U like working in the World Bank? Somebody working there asked me if I would be interested to consider it for future carrier. Actually this happened on Saturday at the GSAS luncheon. This guy and his wife both have been working with the World Bank and his wife is still working there and they are always looking around to recruit people from the outside fields and with interesting backgrounds. Seems that Materials Science and Engineering doesn't still have a university monopoly there. And being a female with dual European and middle-eastern nationalities is even better than recommendation letters. Finally a job that being American citizen is actually is at ur disadvantage ;) Anyway, it's not for me right now. I still want to get into academia. Something is definitely wrong with me if I can forsake even in theory a well paid / prestigious job with teaching. I would have said it's genetics if it wasn't for having a lawyer and a surgeon as sisters!!! :D Or maybe it is genetics: we each do what we do for the passion we have for it!

      Susan, seems, is reconsidering the Switzerland thing. She is going as part of her sabbatical to Lausanne for three months and I have talked with her and she was ok with my going there for two weeks and do some of my experiments. And I have almost arranged for taking an extra week at the end of those two to go to Iran and see my grandma and the grand-aunts. It was just the most perfect thing. And now she is reconsidering cause the responsible of the electroceramic lab in EPFL is very possessive of things done in her lab. Aaaah, whatever, maybe I will take off ten days anyway and go to Iran even though I won't stop at Lausanne.

      So I was lazily laying on my belly in the bed, Calvin and Hobbes on the ground and reading their funny stories once again that Tiger comes to the room. "Can I have the ring a sec?" and I think, ok, he has been in the cleaning-bug-mood the whole day, I bet he wants even to clean my rings. I rise my hands and he say "No, just the other one". Ok, he has a preference for our engagement ring, I already knew that... Next second he goes down on his knees, I rise my head to see what is he doing. "Would U marry me?" and I end up in giggles under the bed sheets. He smiles, turns his head to left and right "I am still waiting for an answer". I get my head out from under the sheets and say "Oh, yes My Love" and he puts back the ring on my finger. Gives me a kiss and goes back downstairs to clean the grill. That was half an hour ago, he is gone to play golf and I have still this (don't dare call it stupid!) smile on my face. Isn't he the sweetest tiger of the whole world? Even more than Hobbes?

      * Here is another was of catergorizing the blogs: 1) the ones that U read once and decide never to go back to read; 2) the ones that U read and U feel compelled to go back and read everytime they get updated; 3) the ones that U read and U feel like U need to write too.  * These last two days have been really culturally active ;) [and I mean besides the discussions with my advisor about my research!]. Friday night there was a recital by the grad students in College of Liberal arts. Some of them were plain amazing. There was this girl that was singing a piece from "I Capuleti e i Montecchi" (or in reverse order Montecchi e Capuleti!) from Bellini. She was from S. Korea so her Italian wasn't really great and the words definitions were not really perfect, but the voice, my gosh the voice... so crystal clean and the vibrant with emotion. I had tears in my eyes, the same with Eve. There musical pieces that are nice to listen to and U lose urself in your memories but there are pieces that are so wonderful that U lose urself in them, and this was definitely one of those that U lose urself in them! * Yesterday we went to see Othello, performed by the Guthrie Theatre. Very well done. It was a modern presentation, the costumes and scenography were superb and the actors were very good:I really liked it a lot. We already had nice seats, but then at the interval we went to seat some rows even closer and it was even better ;)

      Last night, I made my last rehearsal with Olivier at home at around 8:30. At the end made a few changes, saved the file and put away the stuff.  This morning I come to work, try to get hold of Raja to talk over with him a couple of points before the group rehearsal of this afternoon and... Powerpoint decide that it can not open the file. We tried everything we knew of (sending it by email to another computer and opening it over there, copying it to CD and open it in still another computer, renaming it,...). The only thing that was working was printing it w/o opening the file. Man, I was really taken badly...Very close to hysteria to tell the truth! Well, hysteric if just sitting down and crying can be the sign of hysteria. Anyway, I found Mike the computer guy after an hour...and imagine what: on his computer the CD was working properly. Fantastic, I get a copy of it on another CD bring it...On my computer, the file finally opens and...the animation of the last slide is completely screwed up. I try to open the slide....and dadaaaan...it crates a fatal error and powerpoitn can not open it anymore. I thought I was going to have a nice nervous breakdown right there... Bring back the file to Mike's computer: works fine there. So he suggests to try on the computer in the conference room. I spend 10 minutes on the stupid computer because the monitor doesn't show up anything even thought but the lights on the computer and monitor are green. I check and there is no connection between monitor and computer! What!?!? At this point, I go back to Mike "Oh, yea, the monitor is not connected upstairs!". Right!!! I make the changes on his computer, we re-save the file on still a third CD (he has not left the last one open to new files!) and I bring it back to my computer and everything seems to be nice. I made my rehearsal with the group this afternoon and came back to make the changes...The file doesn't open again!!!!! I am going completely crazy... goes for the worst I will use the old presentation and who cares.... Oh, and (allow me the Italian expression) the cherry on the pie: I receive ten minutes ago and email from the Grad office that they have misplaced the committee appointment signatures paper so they won't have my paperwork ready for Monday!!!! Yahoooooooooo... at least they are going to let Susan know in advance, so she'll know it wasn't my fault. I am so tired now... what a crazy morning.

      I called Lele, yes, I called him and made him a huge surprise. He continued to say "Madonna" for a dozen of times before I could stop myself from laughing and him from saying "Madonna" again. I have known him from the first year at the university in Padova and he has been a great friend over the years. It is amazing still now that we can go on for months without contacting eachother and the day we talk together is like there has been no separation at all. Everytime I hear his voice is like as if we were still there talking at lunch over a dish of pasta about whatever would come in our minds. He is an incredibly talented musician. He has learned to play guitar by himself and when he sings his songs, he has the ability of brings up such an emotion in people that I have seen people (in general, male and female!) have tears in their eyes even when they couldn't understand the words. Even though he is really a poet in an engineer skin... We spent an hour on the phone talking about the snapshots of memories, our present and our futures... Ah, it is always so nice to talk to such a good old friend. Balm for the soul and fuel for the heart. Like his music! :)) It's funny. This last Xristmass when finally I was able to introduce him and tiger, he asked us if we had a song. Me and tiger looked at eachother and said "we don't have "A" song...we have a whole CD: your CD!!!!!". He was so funny to look at then... (he confessed later that he wanted to make us a CD with our songs...how could he know that he has already done it?! ;) ). BTW, there are only three copies of this CD in the world. His copy, my copy and KK's copy (KK was the one that masterized my cassette's songs on a CD! So he kept a copy for himself!!!). So, I guess everybody else has to wait some more years, before I convince Lele to really try to become a professional musician...

      Our house in Iran is actually one of the first works of my dad. The house is all expanded in height and has 3floors on one side and 4 on the other. Everything moves around the central stairs and in fact U enter from the second floor. I love the house! (one of my worst memories is of one summer when my uncle trying to convince my parents to sell the house after we have moved to Italy. U should have seen the three sisters crying aloud against the proposal!). Anyway, the point is that the stairs are wide and have a low handrail-wall. So, from the last floor's bedrooms U can see down to the basement. My worst nightmare as a kid was falling with my whole bed down the hole. I still have the dream sometimes, but it is not so scary (maybe because the propotions between me and the house have changed!). And once (when I was really too young 2 remember!) I have fallen down the stairs really and broken my fronthead (the scar is now hidden in my hair :P ). So, this unconscious fear of stairs has always been with me. To make it worst, when we were at the second year of mid school we went to to Florence on a school trip. We went to visit the  urlLink Brunelleschi's cupola in Santa Maria del Fiore . It happened that the elevator was broken and so it was decided that it was worth using the stairs to get there. Now imagine these stairs worn out by centuries (it was built in the early 1400) of priests' walking, literally rounded and in some places useless but in the corners. These narrow spiral staircases, in the cupola itself with the walls bending in places by 30 degrees...99 m in height,ill illuminated and to make it worst used by people in both directions. A real nightmare... I took us a really long time to get up there and I was so scared that I couldn't even get off the walls and get to the front of railing to enjoy the view of the whole Florence at my feet. I could barely keep myself from crying. The worst part was going back downstairs: I was so sure I was going to fall and die...and kill somebody else too! That experience just made everything worst. So, now I am really scared of heights, especially artificial ones I don't mind it so much while hiking, but get me in a skyscraper with windows and I won't be able to get close to the window if the railing in now higher that my waist. All these reverie, just because last night I had another nightmare about the stairs. Endless, narrow dark stairs... Awful!

      * If U look out of the window, U'd think "such a romantic picture". The blue sky, a couple of white fluffy clouds, green grass, just a few daisies proud of their lives and the trees with a just a hint of the green behind the brown cortex. Just don't dare put ur feet out: it is freezing cold with the wind chill. Somewhere in the twenties!  * I am having again anxiety attacks. I work completely absorbed and then a couple of hours later, I get out of the trance-like concentration and begin to freak out about how fast the time has passed and how much more I still have to do.  * Breath in, breath out... (not even I was doing pregnancy breathing exercises!!!!)  * Shall I put on some music? Something between Enya, New Flamenco and Opera... Any suggestions?

      The report is the hands of the committee members... I feel a little bit better. I know it is very childish, but I kind of don't dare to look at it any more, I am scared that I may find errors, typos, anything that is less than perfect! Whatever... Now I am back home and so I am taking my time, going through articles and notes. I will prepare a basic talk and then practice it with the people of the group on Thursday afternoon say. Speaking of afternoons: it is a gorgeous afternoon (ok, almost evening!). The sun is still out, slightly windy....and damn cold outside :P Of course it is gorgeous only if U r inside!!!! BTW, our pansies are obstinately trying to survive the polar temperatures. Beside the first one that committed suicide with the first signs of cold, the others are really doing their best to resist: their sense of endurance is admirable ;) Watch and learn! And by the way of plants: even the Wandering Jew is doing pretty well... I am still wondering who has chosen such a weird name for the poor plant. Mah... Ok, I am going back to Calogero and my presentation.  urlLink Calogero , the French singer!!!! I wouldn't exchange Tiger for anybody else...

      *I love Turandot... As in many other things, there are some arias that get under ur skin and that U can continue to sing by urself without caring at all how badly U sing! prophetically, I am choosing this lines, cause I just finished proof-reading for the 100th time (no, Hossein, I don't mean literally! :P) the report and I am going to make some nice 4 copies and give it to the committee members. Well, Susan's copy has to wait till next Monday: she is in Korea right now and will be back next Monday for my oral. She is funny sometimes: she has sent out the schedule for the private meetings on Monday and she has put in me again at 8!!!! I wonder what will we talk about on the morning of my oral Comps!?!?  * Ha, now it is "Che gelida manina"/"what a cold hand"...My hands are frozen (literally!) right now. Maybe it is because it is once again winter cold (wind chill this morning:14F!!!) and the heat is not working properly in the office. That is probably the real reason, but my mom has this other explanation (highly scientific!) that when I am working with high concentration, I drain the blood from the vessels that are not "necessary", so the brain gets more... As U can see this theory is not very sound: it would presume that I have  brain, which I have more than ever doubts that I have.

      I had even adjusted the clocks last night but it didn't help. Now it is noon and I haven't even had breakfast. Anybody has anything against breakfast at 1pm or shall I call it brunch, just because of the time of the day? I just finished the written report...well, almost. I would like still to smoothen out the last point in the "Future work" section, but hey maybe I won't. Yesterday Ioanna called to see I wanted to go to Saints (take Central Perk from Friends and take out the singing stage and Gunter!) to work on our stuff (she is preparing her senior thesis and poster. Yeah, sure...See U there in say one hour (2pm!)?! Ok! It was almost packed, but with my luck behind me, I got the best spot (electrical plug availability for the laptop!). Ioanna arrived at 3 something (I am the best example of the fact that not all the Iranians or Italians are always late) :)) Olivier, Steve and Yuyen have gone to the NRG expo and they came later on to Saints to get a coffee (they sat at another table so they wouldn't disturb!)... But, gosh, I was amazed with myself: I worked so well!!!! :)) Happy tigress! (Tiger just came downstairs and is now reading my post... so I could steal a kiss from him: yummy!)

      ...I think I have been missing the summer for too long. Up in the seventies today and a gentle breeze. We had almost the perfect bike ride. It would have helped if I could use all the gears on my bike, but Sean has still to adjust the gear shifters (a tri-athlete can be a very helpful friend!). A nice BBQ for lunch and this evening a nice concert. Andy was telling us that the other people in the orchestra kind of snob him cause he is not a music major. Isn't that stupid!?! Hmmm...actually sounds quite familiar. Snobbing someone just out of jealousy. Childish maybe, but seems part of human nature: happens all over the world!

      Yes, I believe firmly in the usefulness of self-pampering...at least every now and then. So, go get a nice warm bath, a hair cut, dress up nicely, call a dear friend (or many of them) or that hottie U have a crush on and go to an upscale restaurant.  Indulge urself in somebody's company U love or just stay home and watch an old favorite movie while ur toe nails' polish is drying (hmmm, maybe U guys want to skip this last part. Or up to U...U can even try it! Maybe it will turn out hippie and cool! If it does, I want photos of the blue or red nails!). Enjoy urself and for a day forget whatever have been stressing U lately. ... PS. All this is just the effect of the wonderful weather outside... Have I ever said how much I love the sunshine?!?

      Either one of the professors in MATSE has a great sense of humor or is so deeply involved in his/her research not to be able to understand what she/he writes. Among the posters that hung on the walls of the first floor of the department you can find this very interestingly titles poster:  "The physics of penetration".  I wonder if this is part of the policy to increase the undergrads' interest in MATSE!!!!

      I found 1$ in coins on my desk 5minutes ago... Ah, gone the days of secret admirers that would leave flowers, chocolate and cards. Either people don't have fantasy anymore or I seem very cheap!

      Sometimes it just feels nice to say a nice "goodmorning" to people and have a smile on ur face. Well, I should have said it ALWAYS feels good! Ok, I feel lots better now...Maybe it is the rest that I got, maybe it is the new purpose: work harder and enjoy life anyway! (Ha...and U though which wonderful new purpose for my life I could have ever found!!!) Maybe it is because tonight we are going to see "SOUND OF MUSIC" (I didn't brag about it as much as I thought afterall!). Maybe it is that when U wake up in the morning in the arms of Tiger U realize how lucky U R. Maybe it is just that putting on lacy underwear and taking care of ur makeup makes U care more about yourself anyway. Maybe it is the contagiousness of random acts of kindness (sharing an umbrella under the pouring rain is good!). Maybe it is opening ur blog and finding a few sentences that make U smile. Maybe it is that green apple that tempts u on ur desk. I don't know what it is, but it definitely feels good ;) Everybody out there: have a great day!

      My goodness, I didn't even realized it. One second I was up and normal and the next I can't keep my eyes open. I am going home... I really need some rest. I feel like somebody has beaten me up. I will either pass out soon...or I will pass out soon. Not many options really! Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

      I just felt bad after I wrote the last post. I have forgotten to smile. Well, now I am trying again... It is amazing how much a small gesture (just try to pull the corners of ur mouth) can make a difference. :) Doesn't that feel better. Ok, I still don't feel anything about the exam, but at least I have the smile, right?! And even though it is pouring outside, I need just to move slightly my head to look at the colorful rainbow that Aileen has drawn for me. How inspiring can be a drawing of a six year old!!!  If she just knew it.

      So I survived... Yes, I am a survivor. Ok, it wasn't even that bad. A strong pass. Susan was happy. Good job. But still I don't fell anything. Not happy. Not sad. Not relieved. Not anything... We went to celebrate at dinner...20 something people...Then we went back to our place... a huge Black Forest cake (Bernd's work) and an almost as huge Triple Chocolate cake by Andres (good advice to all girls out there: have some guy friends that know how to cook! The girls never offer to make cakes, but guys do!). We added two half gallons of Creamery IceCream and the drinks... It was nice to have all people that care about U around and celebrating... Even though I still weren't feeling that is was for me. Something is definitely wrong with me... I even woke up this morning at 6am, came to work just slightly later than usual (time to call home and tell them everything went fine!) and have been doing experiments the whole morning... Maybe it is the awful weather, maybe it is that I have still to let myself go.... Maybe it is going to be better tomorrow. Afterall, tomorrow is another day...

      I am still breathing. It is good sign definitely. I should try and conitnue to breath. Breath in...breath out. I should also remember that my hands need some blood circulation also.  It's no use to have the brain drain the blood form the rest of the body when I am not able to even click the remote to put on the next slide. Breath in... breath out.

      How come the meetings with my advisor put me always in such a awe?! She is back today and we had out meeting at 8:30 (I arrived at 8:20 and time to check my mail that she was in my office asking if I wanted to talk!!!). Anyway, the results are good, we are proceeding...She is putting me in fourth (maybe even in fifth) gear. I think I need a first with all the weight of stuff she thinks I should get done in two weeks. Oh, and BTW, I should write and get proof-read by her an article by end of May..End of MAY?!?! An article for Journal of Applied Physics ready by May. Argh! Yes, I freaked out again and was already blurting out things like "I think I should take the laptop with me..." to Tiger (he was using our lab this morning!), when he looked at me like "WHAT?!?!?!", so I finished with "...the weekend we are going with ur parents to Chesapeake Bay".  What a wonderful way of begin the trip to Texas. Instead of relaxing, I will be stressing myself over the stuff I will need to do as soon as I am back. I am completely crazy. Will out heroine be able to push to the back of her mind all the things she need to get done?  Will she be able to enjoy herself?  YES she will. She will just forget about state College for these 4 days. (I am trying auto-hypnosis, repat with me: "I will enjoy myself!") So, people of Houston beware... :D

       By  urlLink popular request   urlLink  , here is the rest of the story of Sean and our underwear... So we are walking downtown to have dinner with Eve and Al when in the middle of the street we see Sean riding his biking. No, he wasn't going to join us for dinner, he wanted to have a last practice at home. But he had already with him the slip of paper with my fake name and number. (Candy? Do I look like somebody called Candy?!?!?!) Anyway...we meet Eve and Al at 8 and the first thing she says is "I forgot them at home...after dinner I'll go and pick them up". In fact she did... While the rest of us went for a short walk to begin to digest the BBQ ribs (already in Texan mood as can be seen!). Right before ten while waiting outside the club, waiting for Eve to come, Tiger turns to me and say "Hey, look it's Sean's father. He is coming too!". Ah well, fantastic..and my courage is already trembling! 2 secs later, Eve shown up with these huge panties: one red and one white, with this shiny fabric and interwoven golden and silvery threads, drenched in some perfume for definitely too long. Doubts would have killed me there if it wasn't for the goliardic spirit of Al..."Oh, if U r going to throw him those, I want to wink and him and send him kisses!" :)) Anyway, Sean's performance was only half an hour long and many of the people that were them knew him for a reason or another... Really, he did pretty well...if it wasn't for the fact that he forgot the words for a couple of songs :D He patched it up so well that if he wasn't singing "Oh, I have forgotten the rods now. Something about rotten and forgotten. Any help is appreciated though. So sing along with me...dorodo dadada..." (Or something similar!) we wouldn't have realized he was inventing out of the blue. Now, right before the last song, he takes out a hat "for tips and ladies numbers"...But I just couldn't decide to move there and slip that phone number thing in it! Having Eve continuing to say "I dare U... or no don't. But I dare U...:))" didn't help. Anyway, the last song was there and no more chance but it. Me and Eve looked at each other and with the first clapping, the panties were circling our head (Once more cowgirl, Texan mood!), then they were flying onto the stage with screams of "Sean, we love you". Sean was strawberry pink, he was father was laughing himself dead. And the people that didn't know us will moving their chairs just a trifle bit further :)) ... It was fun and fair :) Well, all besides when, coming back from the restroom, a guy asking his friend who I was, was answered "Oh, she is one of the underwear girls." :D what could I have said...Nothing I guess!

      I tried all day long to get connected to blogger, but no luck. No luck even with anything remotely connected to the blogspot. Either it was my stubbornness or I had something I really wanted to write. I have forgotten which one or why... ... SO, we are leaving tomorrow afternoon for Houston, TX. It is not nice that I haven't still told Susan, but considering that she hasn't been around since after my Comps... I will tell her tomorrow morning. ... I am having a swimming suite crisis. I may forget (how very unfortunate!) my s.s.! Futile, superficial and stupid...or whatever else U want to call it...I have this fear of the first s.s. try on of the season. I can go completely ballistic over it. And the poor Tiger stands it all. Well, doesn't help talking with people that are size 0 or that lament about being size 2!!!! How can anybody be ever a size zero I wonder...Not to mention the effects on ur subconscious "I am a ZERO!". Maybe that's because these American girl barely get up to 5 feet 4. Yeah, sure.. let's try to convince myself that 5 feet 10 needs a bigger size than whatever these mini-ones are. It is still very unfair...Size zero....aaaaaaaahhhh. ...

      ...we are supposed to meet the others around 8 to have dinner before going to see Sean's performance at Bar Blue. He is really funny. He has sent me an email this morning that reads kind of like this:  "I have to ask U a favor. I am going to pass around a hat at the end of the performance to ask for tips and girls phone numbers. Could U please put in a fake number...just to break the ice for the other girls..." The noble soul of the modern musician... Of course I said yes... What I didn't say was that me and Eve have also bought these huge flashy underwear (something like size 18 if it exists) from WalMart and we are planning to throw them at him during his last piece while behaving like mad fans.  Poor man...he will get much more than he expected...

      I have spent the whole day reading...spin glasses, dipolar glasses, relaxors and nonlinear behavior.  Hmmm, my brain is probably gone and that's probably the reason why I am thinking how amazing would it be to consider the semantic and philosophical approach of choosing the names for these stuff.  So spin glasses are really things that spin around (instead of their spins spinning around!) and dipolar glasses have a double personality, relaxors are just too relaxed to respond or kind of respond lazily, nonlinears are the one that behave out of the line...  Sometimes, I think the basic science would be so much easier if we just change our approach to it.  ... Yes, my brain is completely gone.

      The trees have turned green with leaves overnight! The temperature is somewhere in the eighties and a gentle breeze keeps the weather just wonderful. Somebody is really confused up there... I mean, we barely have had a spring...and I have had barely been able to go shopping for summer cloths ;) [which is definitely more important!]. And an even bigger problem right now is that my willingness to work is very very inifitesimal..let's say directly it is zero!!!! Gosh, I almost feel as if it was 15 yrs ago and it was summer in the garden in Karaj. As my mom says "Every summer I look at ur corner and I think I can see U on the swing, with a book and the grapes". I add maybe with the cherries or the apples depending on what time of the summer it was... I really would love to be able to go to Iran this summer even if for a little while. I haven't been back to Iran for at least 4 or maybe even 5 summers now. The fact that I don't remember is already bad enough! Hmmm... I should really try to give it a shot and see if I can do it. Which means that I would need to work double hard till then. Right... I just found a good motivation to go back to work.

      Yes, skipped lunch again (ok, I got an apple: but how much does that really count?!). I have also lost my fingertips while polishing the sample (but I got the interference this time!): perfect time to commit a crime! No fingerprints left behind to incriminate me ;) They are setting outside the net for the volleyball game but I don't have even the force to get up from this chair. Now that the Interferom setup is working, I have been trying to work on the article, but unfortunately, it seems that my brain is not working anymore. Whatever... Shall I go grab something to eat? Or wait directly till tonight? We have a reservation at the Gamble Mill for 7:30. BTW, this is one of the things that I really can't bear about Pennsylvania and its small towns. They close all the restaurants so early. I mean, even for the weekend, when the kitchen closes at 8:30pm (!!!), the don't take reservation for any time later than 7:30! Anyway...

      Ehm. So, I prepared the sample and brought it to the Interferometer. After half an hour of struggle with the setup I concluded that the was no interference: kind of difficult to get any result out of an interferometer if there is no interference!!! The problem? I haven't polished well enough the back of my sample, so of course even the platinum deposited wasn't smooth enough to be mirror-like reflecting light! I guess I will end up spending the afternoon in the polishing room (BTW, I always end up smoothing my nails more than the samples! That could be one of the problems I guess). ... this has nothing to do with the rest, but I just found a flyer that declares there will be volleyball at 4pm on the field behind MRL! Even if not for playing, it's gonna be worth going to watch the professors jumping up and down. Ehm, actually maybe it's even worth try to play with jeans and shirt. Can always get the chance to spike on some of them ;)

      Ok, I know, it doesn't show a special dedication to work if I begin the day by saying that the weekend is here, but still it stays a fact that in some 8 or so hours, we can consider it weekend, right?! It is not entirely my fault: the temperatures are back to the seventies, a gentle breeze, the magnificent perfume of the blossomed trees, the lush green grass...Where do I find the spirit of working? (I have been already working an hour on the interferometer BTW!) How is that everytime I have to begin a new step of the work I become very lazy? I mean, if it is something I have already begun, it is fine with me, but if it some new step...ih, I become kind of glued to the chair! I guess some good psychologist over there will be able to see the innermost fears that grip the human being, but afterall I can considerate my PhD as something I have already begun so I should be in the frenetic stage of completing it, right?! Hmmm... Is there a way to get ur PhD soon without having to work that hard?! I am open to any suggestion!!! One last consideration... I think I am really ready for the academic life: I have many ideas and I just need a slave, pardon, grad student to do the work for me!

      ... I have already spent my whole morning on the set-up (again) of the system... Well, I had done almost half of it...I was so proud. Yes, I am using the past tense! Guess what... I am really happy and I am just going to add the next mirror, I pick it up, move to its new place and...Hey, where did the laser go?! I had taken off my first mirror!!!! Damn...now I have to begin from zero again...or almost. I have still the first mirror, the first beam splitter and the second mirror in place. Yeah, right!At least this time I left the message "Do not touch" before leaving for lunch.  I came back to our building (30 sec walk between these two buildings) and everybody has already left for lunch! Great... This is the second time in two days.

      What can I say?... I had set up the interferometer (I mean...U need to build the whole optical path and then make sure everything is in the right place. So it takes up plenty of time and energy!!! An expert or somebody who works continuously with it can do it in 5hours...Me, takes definitely more time, considering that I don't like it really!). Now, I go over there to take the measurements of the sample holder to prepare the sample to be inserted into it. Open the door, turn on the light, open the curtains on the table and ........AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH....Everything is moved. Damn it, there was not a single piece that was in its supposed place! Crazy!!!!!! I think I will go nuts. Well, I will tell Susan that I need more time to readjust everything, but still!!! Damn... BTW, the worst part is that the person that has moved the stuff around is the professor responsible of the instrument. I would have left a message if I haven't been told that nobody has been using the stuff for the last couple of years!!! Imagine, if someone was supposed to do it right now...Sure mea culpa, but still, it drives me crazy anyway!

      ...Very British but I begin with the weather. Can U believe we were in the frozen twenties this morning?!? (Mental note: move closer to the equator as soon as possible. Pennsylvania has a too damned weird weather!). Supposedly it is supposed to improve to the high fifties, but hey.. who knows what's coming next?! On a separate note: Max called yesterday but we were not home. He is arriving this Sunday and he is beginning the work on Monday. I just can't believe he left in July for his Visa back to Germany and it took him so long! Can't wait to have him back... have been missing the old crazy Max. One of the best guy friends ever. Just looking forward to see him. I haven't still begun to write the damn article. I mean I have a lot of things at hand, but I have to re-write the whole report in the form of article , include the figures, make it all condensed, bla bla. Damn. I haven't even thought at all about the talk that I have to prepare for the ONR conference. Bad me. Shoot, now that I think of, I have still to give a look to the Interferometer system, if I have any intention to show Susan some results from it by next week!!!! Don't freak out... (I think I have this masochist thing in me. I write down all I have to do, so I can prepare myself but I end up only freaking out about it!!! Plainly crazy!). Ok, I am freaked out enough that I feel I REALLY have to go back to work NOW!

      went very well... Pierre has made a huge list of things that we could do with double possibility for rain and sun. We spent Friday in San Antonio, enjoying the festive atmosphere of La Fiesta...the rain was mostly only a drizzle and after 5pm we had even the sun ;)  Saturday, a late brunch with some friends, then a visit to the Menil Collection (wow, some very nice Magritte, Ernst and De Chirico's!), then when the rain stopped to the Battlefield (or maybe the name was something else!) Monument where we ere supposed to see the re-enactment of the battle between the Mexican and the Texans. Turned out that part of it has been cancelled at 11, but the weather was so nice then that we stayed anyway and went through the small fair and enjoyed it quite a bit... Time for an hour of swimming pool, get changed and out for a "real steak house" experience at Morton's. And even though I admit that the steaks were good (but mind, not the best ever. Happens that we had our best steak ever in Boston!), the company was the best thing...Ok, almost all of these people were working with Shell, they were from all over the world and they were some of the most interesting people I have ever met. Just to show that being young and successful doesn't mean being also snob!!! Oh, among the other things, turns out that the ex-BF of one of the girls was a thirty something old Iranian dude, that was better to lose than to find. It was amazing to find this so stereotyped Iranian "taazeh be doorun reside" described by somebody non-Iranian. I was kind of feeling ashamed for being even associated to a person like this even by only sharing the nationality! Anyway, we had  agreat time and concluded the night/morning later on by visiting a couple of clubs. Sunday saw us begin the day with an even later brunch. A small stop at The Galleria (man, I should have "discovered" the place earlier!!!!), the best Mexican food ever and a DVD at the house of a French couple of friends... Over all, I have to say it was one of the best time I have had recently... And  urlLink Negar ... I looked everywhere for the bluebonnets and it turned out to become the theme of the W/E this search of the b.b. We saw many flowers, especially yellow and orange, some red and maybe five pinkish/purplish and I continued to ask everyone to show me the bluebonnets. I ended up being shown every single flower along the way regardless of their color!!!!

      Ladies and gentlemen, I am back! We arrived yesterday at home somewhere around 4pm...had a quick lunch, went for a quick nap, but woke up at 8:40 pm! ;) Poor Tiger, today he had even this field trip to Kenmetal for the fellowship he has won, so he had to get up again at 6 am! Anyway...let me say first of all that we had a great time, even with the not so cooperative weather. We left somewhere around noon from State College and some 3hours later we were waiting for our flight at the designated gate at Pittsburgh airport. We had almost no delay...well, at least not at the departure ;) We begin to suspect something was up when we hear on the speakers "Hi folks, this is the first officer. If there is any doctor or nurse on this flight, please report to the hostess at the rear of the cabin"...Hah....ok, so there is a medical emergency it seems. In fact some time later "Hi folks. This is again the first officer. We are going to have an emergency landing in Birmingham, Alabama. We have a passenger with a medical emergency,....". Ok, that already sounds a bit more trouble. Anyway, we land in this wonderful airport with the view of the this building that is still up by mere good luck, the paramedic come on board, after half an hour the lady is on a wheel chair and leaving toward the Airport Building. Tiger is very optimistic "Half an hour, that's fine, we gonna be still almost on time...". Sure, whatever. Half an hour later we are still sitting in the plane..." Hi folks, this is the first officer. We have some bureaucracy and paper work to take care of, they won't let us take off before the weight of the paperwork exceeds the one of the plane. Be patient, we'll be on the way soon." Another half an hour passes and still nothing "Hi folks..." (and I was already thinking about killing him with his Hi folks!) "...Well we have another problem. There are usually four oxygen tanks on each flight for first aid and our passenger has used two of them. We can not fly with less than three full tanks. Now we have contacted the Northeastern and ... and either they don't have any to give to they are willing to do so. We are trying to get them refilled at a local hospital." :D Isn't this just ridiculous... Anyway...half an hour after that we were taking off finally. On the other hand, we had this high school basketball team on flight that never stopped playing with their cell phones. So the first officer calls out again "Hi folks. This is the first officer. We have to remind you that the use of cell phone s or any other electronic device is strictly prohibited on this flight. Thank you for the cooperation". Ten minutes later "I remind you that the use of cell phones is prohibited on this flight. And I am talking in particular to the members of the BB team that seems to find it amusing. Interference with flight procedure is a federal crime. Stop using those cell phones... I apologize to the rest of the passengers". We finally land and there were a dozen of policemen waiting for the BB team. Wow... yes, this was Texas: 12 policemen for 12 players!

      * hmmm, just finished a two-hour seminar on sexual harassment! Unfortunately I don't believe that much in the policies being put into acts. Sorry Suzanne, not much worth the time we had to spend in the seminar room!  *Barb is beginning to freak out. We are still behind with almost everything in preparation of the conference next week (Susan is the chairwoman and Barb of course is the logistic organizer!). On the top of everything else, her temporary assistant got sick and the server crashed last evening. That's not fun...poor my mom (Barb is one of my adoptive moms here!)! I am trying to help, but sometimes I feel I am maybe creating distraction more than getting the job done :(  * My poster printed out all weird and that's not good, especially because Mike (the computer guy) is now spending all his time on preparing the abstract CDs and repairing the server problems for Barb. I am beginning to think I some extra help (prayers or vudu: I am not picky!) to get everything ready on time.  *The good thing is that Max is supposed to arrive this evening and stay with us till Sunday. The bad news is that I still have to begin to practice my talk even thought he slides are there. Where I am going to find time to do that....Well, I admit that this morning when I woke at 5 something am and was too tired to get up, I was reviewing in my mind the slides and putting words together for each. Gee, I am beginning to be really a nerd.  *Speaking of sleeping...While I was reviewing my talk, Tiger was sleeping pacifically. He was going to work late today and just took time to "wake up" to tell me so. He didn't want to spend too much time at work in suite and tie: he is invited at the Dean's house for lunch with 4 other students who are the recipients of this years' Kenmetal fellowship. :)) I would really like to see him at such a formal lunch. Even when we go to nice restaurants he never puts on suite and tie...poor thing. He is going to be pretty uncomfortable!

      shame on me....to avoid the NEWS channels so much (they all make me white angry with their biased opinions and no news and even those few news handpicked to move on their political views! Even though I follow Iran's news, I follow much less what happens in Italy! Shame on me again)... Anyway, shame on me to discover so late that  urlLink Lili Gruber had resigned ! Unbelievable!  She is really a good journalist: great personality, a smart-head and one of the best anchorman/anchorwomen in Italy. Now she has resigned in protest against Berlusconi's tampering with even the public television! I really hope she will be elected to the European parliament: it is about time that EU takes steps to restrict Berlusconi in his use of a whole country as private property!!!

      *The sky is blue, the trees are full of blossom, the bees are busy on the flowers...and I am stuck in the office doing basically nothing. I guess it is in part my own fault if my brain is so gone!!! Whatever it is, I know that I have no way to work today and by work I mean doing something useful toward the fulfillment of my PhD degree. * I called home the other day and the only thing my mom had time to tell me was that old friends from Iran have called. I mean ok, I know the people. When we were kids (say 5-6 yrs old) we used to go to their place and viceversa. He has been going to the university my dad and we used to call him Uncle (what is this thing about having so many uncle and aunties anyway?! My real aunts, well actually, my real great-aunts always made fun of us cause we had so many other aunts!)... Anyway, we are getting distracted here. So, their daughter has got engaged some month ago with this Iranian doctor from Germany (or some other European country that I don't remember!). Arranged thing of course... Anyway, my mom on the contrary never goes around talking about her daughters and their relationships. Bless her! I am its no-ones business anyway, right?! Now, my father was in Iran a while ago and it seems that he has told them about me and Tiger. Now, they have made such a big fuss about it that they felt they needed to call later home in Italy (when my dad would have been back!) to make the official congratulations! Ok, thank U people..but still I don't understand what's the big fuss about this all. I can't even understand this big celebrations with girls putting on their white dresses, the guy in smoking, family and friends gathering and spending huge money over it. I don't know...Maybe it makes the couple happier?! It is amusing for me to see pictures of this engagement party or that. I am strongly for keeping it private/personal. To tell the truth it is funny that between me and Tiger he is the one that would like the big thing with everyone that we know invited and me, the one for the small thing with the mayor in our town in Italy, those twenty people in our lives that we really care for and let it be it. We are thinking about how to compromise ;)

      I am still a bit tired... Factors that don't help my feeling tired: 1) having a headache; 2) wonderful weather outside: finally warm, sunny and gently breezy all together and me in the office! 3) Ravi, Enuki, Ichiro and Hajime having left for Florida for vacation; It's enough for me to look at their empty desks to want to be in their place; 4) visiting  urlLink Mola's blog  and listening to the requiems. The songs he chooses as soundtrack are painfully beautiful... Make me feel this urging to leave the desk and get outside, under the sun and warm up my soul again. (note to myself: have to pick up some more cheerful; CDs with me tomorrow!!!!)

      U know the day is going to be long and tiresome when U meet ur advisor in front of ur office's door and speak for 10 minutes before opening the door and go inside to discuss some results for some 20 more minutes! So why am I wondering about my being dead tired?! Thanks god, the meeting for Friday was moved to Monday afternoon, otherwise I have no clue how could I get my talk ready for then. At least now I have the weekend...sort of! Considering that we'll have Max over probably for the whole weekend I will be in trouble anyway. I already have trouble keeping my eyes open: going to bed at past midnight doesn't go well with being at work by 8:30am and spending the whole day in front of your computer, writing, formatting and re-adjusting talk and poster! No... it simply doesn't!

      * I can't believe that I had to turn on the heater today. Man...it's cold! Yes, this morning the wind chill was getting us down to 30F. Hereby I declare the pennsylvanian weather crazy.  * I am beginning to really like to have for lunch apples. Sitting here by myself and reading a book or something. Recently the "group lunches" have begin to be a bit too much for me. First of all nobody talks: they all sit there is silence and eat and then all back to the office again in silence. Furthermore, the idea of a healthy lunch for me is somewhat different than Chinese Buffet or stuff like that. So, I am getting on with my apples and my books ;)  * The poster for ONR is basically done. The talk has been polished but especially length reduced. It is really tough to prepare a talk like this. It would need a good amount of background, but if I spend too much time on that, then I end up with not enough space/time for my results. Hmmm...needs a talk with Susan.

      U get up and U feel like U r missing something. Like today. I still don't know what I have missed or what is it that I should have done, but it feels weird all the same. Hmmmm. It's like when U walk around and ur mind is surrounded by a misty fog. When everything U do is out of habit and not because U think of it. Sometimes U just walk and work and feel because...just because and U know something is missing in all this. Something U quite don't grasp. And it's somewhere right out there but U can't really reach it, maybe because U just don't know what it is. It's one of those days that U feel there should be a poem about. They are just so unreal that they could be dreamy...if it wasn't that dreams are sweet.

      I just discovered that it wasn't the professor moving all the interferometer stuff around: it was the guy himself!!!! Why do U have to lie about it?! He just let it slip today while talking to Eunki that he has been working with the interferometer recently (recently?!?! Right!). Turns out that he is defending on the 21st and today he was asking me again how long I need my setup (my answer: "Regularly from now on, till I finish here with my PhD!!!!")... I am going to spend at least a couple of hours everyday in that lab and I don't want it to become 5-6 hours every morning and every night!!!!

      I had a great weekend. Great time on Friday, sun-bathing on the shores of a lake, dinner out with friends and talking till late over desserts and drinks. Sunday, I worked on the article. Introduction and background needed to be re-written completely from the comprehensive report format and that is done. I will finish hopefully this week/weekend with the rest... Gee, I just realized that I have the ONR conference talk next week and I have to begin to cut and re-impost the Comprehensive oral for that too. Well, well, it is not that bad after all. (Yes, I have recovered from the freak-out mood. As I have said, once I have begun with the work, it all moves more smoothly!) It is also funny and empowering to know that U get a long talk and ur advisor and another member of ur committee get only the three minutes for poster presentation ;)

      * Rumsfeld is such a blockhead! Since when the Geneva convention is open to interpretation? 72hours of sleep deprivation is not considered as "unpleasant treatment" of prisoners?! U gonna be kidding me! * "Your have a wonderful job": If I were one of those troopers stationed in Iraq and I heard R. saying that to me... Well, I won't ever be one of those, would I!?!? * Something completely apolitical: the Spurs-Lakers game! Exciting last quarter (I am for the Spurs of course!): I was already jumping up and down on the bed when Duncan scored. Great shot and then... and then... Fisher. He was great too, but I just wish he hasn't done it in this game with the Spurs! :( * I absolutely need to go shopping. Not only because I need some stuff, but mostly because I need a break from the work and stress! I need something very mundane and brainless to re-charge my batteries! * I caught myself at 1am this morning reviewing my talk in bed! I really think I am fried if even after I had given the talk I felt like reviewing it!!!!!! I have just SOOOO much to do in the incoming two months to be ready for the  urlLink IEEE conference in Montreal  (Mohammad: this one is for U, asking for conference websites!). Lots of experiments!!!!!

      Done, finished, fatto... Feels good to be done with the talk and the conference. It all went well...I got bunch of compliments for the talk. I even surprised myself for the confidence with which I talked and thinking that when I was rehearsing with Ioanna just half an hour earlier I had to control my voice from shaking. In fact she was telling me that I was so cool down there that the laser pointer could have been computer controlled ;) Not bad... I am just sooooooooo tired right now. Last night after the dinner and reception, I went through an hour of lab facility touring with the guys from Rutgers Univ. And then I worked till 11:45pm when Tiger went to pick me up to go home. Sweet one: as soon as I called him after the guys left our lab he said that he could come and work till late too. He broght me also a complete change of cloths: my feet were just dead in high heals after spending 13 hours on them!!! Anyway, back home I worked and rehearsed again the talk and I ended up in bed somewhere around half past one. Got up at 6am today, went with Ioanna over to the conference center and finally when I gave the talk I felt like: woooosh. My whole self relaxed! Damn, it means I am going to put on some pounds again. Ok, I am a bit of a stress-oholic: I give my best under stress and I also lose weight (fantastic!). So even if I lost a pound or so in these three days by eating more (not even a single dessert went by w/o being tried! And we had at least three different ones each lunch and dinner!), I wonder if the coming days are going to be fatal to my line. Why I am writing about my weight anyway? I guess my brain is too fried to care about anything at all right now. Better stop writing otherwise I end talking about things that are best kept "private" (all this said by somebody that has a blog sounds extremely contradictory, but hey, it is still my blog!). Hasta la vista: I really need a nap right now. (Tiger is trying to take me with him to this French party tonight...Hmmm, I should contemplate sleeping over there. I can't say I really had a great time last time!)

      ...noticed that I am complaining too much. I'll try not to do anymore. (Yes, it is once again the smile strategy!) So here are some positive stuff that has happened recently: -Dr Cross stopped in the corridor to say nice talk and that he enjoyed my talk at the conference! Wow, such words from the godfather of ferroelectricity have a weight! -there is an Italian postdoc at MRL! Unbelievable... Her name is Sara and actually she is just staying here for 6 months. She is a PhD student in Italy but the only why to get her here was as a visiting scientist: so she got a promotion at least in her title! ;) She is nice and cute, from Genova...we are basically on the same line as latitude with the only difference in east and west ;) -I think I may have found a (111) oriented film to give to Susan directly tomorrow. (The depositions aas said were not working, so...that's all the better!). -It has stopped raining :) (nope, there is no sunshining, but at least it is not pouring cats and dogs). Am I not good in fiunding positive things...Man, it is all the attitude!

      ...and I am not even at mid point. Well, DaeYong send me an email and he says stuff about "new guy" (w/o any articles!). I guess this new guy is a new grad student in their group so I ask for info about him to contact this person directly and when all this happened.  DaeYong's answer "You can tell a new guy" ?!?!?! What the... On the other side, all my tries to deposit samples today have miserably failed... Three samples fried at annealing, two that seems have some strange malady with all the spots U can see on them and two last ones that I didn't dare deposit more, cause I was seriously worried about their health that didn't look good at all either. Fantastic. The "future in-laws" are arriving this evening. Tiger has cleaned the house yesterday relatively well so at least I don't have to think about that. On the other hand, my feelings about enjoying this long weekend in Annapolis seems pretty remote. I have too much on my mind...having to bring my laptop to finish (or at least try to...) the article doesn't help my prospects either. The weather forecast doesn't seem gracious either. What a wonderful day!!!!

      what a wonderful one to receive an email for an old friend from the times of the Univ. Made really my day and brightened the otherwise gray time I was having. Geee...actually besides the fact that he has broken up with his GF of long time (7 yrs!!!!), everything else is just fantastic. Working for Diadora-Invicta, traveling around the world and enjoying his life. The only thing that disappoints is the fact that it seems that he is still leaving at the place with his parents. That's a problem with the Italian guys: up in their thirties and half of them still live with mom and dad!!! Anyway, great surprise, fantastic news...Hmmm, I was also thinking that I have been telling Ioanna recently that Ale would be the perfect guy for her. She is going to Italy for four weeks this summer. She is going to stay in Treviso...He works nearby. Shall I introduce them?! Wow, I am a transatlantic matchmaker!!!! I should really give it a shot! ;)

      Susan is leaving at the end of next week for Switzerland and we will have our final meetings this coming two days. Damn, I have still to finish my article (I was hoping to work on it a bit more this weekend). Doesn't need mention that the Interferometer being down has reduced my chances of giving Susan any result on that side to zero. There are the stress measurements: under progress. Till now, I can apply up to 100psi (around 700kPa) and the sample continues to sleep and can't care less. Which is fine...cause it confirms our idea of fundamental behavior (Ok, I am not going to bother anyone, but writing the details of! Enough to say that I would have preferred some trend, even though without big variations, but no variation is almost as good!). Hmmm, Susan also wants all the samples we would like her to work on ready for the meeting: packed, described and everything. Right.. I am still finishing to make the solution for making the films tomorrow, crossing my fingers to have the right orientation... I guess I'll have to tell her that those have to wait too! Frustrating. Not Susan's fault...most probably mine, even though I believe that partially it is nobody's fault, but hey: we all need an escape goat (Susan in particular!). Ok, let's see if the lovely Dae-Yong is going to answer my email about the interferometer (I absolutely need written documentation of this last disaster!).

      Mondays are always weird... Do I need to add more?! I almost have spent the whole day w/o bad news. Yeh, right at 4:30pm I decide to stop by Dae-Yong's office. He is defending this week and I was hoping that he would have half an hour next week to show me the signal analyzer program for the Interferometer. Imagine what? Turns out that the computer has been hacked, they have reformatted everything and the way he was putting it, there is not another copy of the program to re-install!!!! Hallelujah! I haven't still even told Susan: with all the misfortunes I have had with this thing, she would believe at this point that I am finding excuses not to use the system! Tomorrow...yes, maybe tomorrow I will tell her. After I have found out exactly how bad is the problem! Aaaaaaaaaaaah. Anyway, tonight out to dinner at Tarragon. I can not believe that the Carnegie House ha the latest reservation time available for 6:30pm! That's crazy! So, we will try The Tarragon. They tell us that the food it good there too. We'll see. I am already worrying for when Tiger's parents will be here (Wednesday night they land here!): we will have a lot of restaurant dining and eating. Not that I mind going out with them: they are lovely people! But we end up eating at restaurants (nice ones always!) and that makes it tough to keep the weight off. At least, I know that this weekend in Maryland, there is the swimming pool and I can do my 50 laps a day (no, I am not that sportive: it is just a cute little swimming pool: max 10-12m in length!). Ok... the solution is done for today, I am going to keep it in the dry box till tomorrow when it will get another day of treatment (all reflux and vacuum and adding new stuff: not even the lab was a SPA!!!! All the chemicals we use are either carcinogenic or suspect of being so! What a wonderful job is mine ;) ).Ok, I am going to check the last of the X-rays on my samples and then I will bike back home: shower and relax a bit before heading out. Let's get the best of these days before it gets rainy again!

      Every weekend, I promise myself to work at least a little bit. The weekend comes and goes by without me moving even a finger for my research, so the Sunday evenings end up being a bit depressing. Anyway, the weekend was great per se. Sun bathing and swimming at Raystown Lake and shopping, dinner with friends, drinks and desserts with the same. I find shopping to be VERY THERAPEUTIC!!! Ok, call be whatever U want, but it is true (unless U R like Tiger that can not tolerate more than 2 hours of shopping per month!)... Anyway, now I have ended up with a gorgeous pair of sandal/slave shoes, a couple of skirts and a dress plus some necessary clinique items :) Oh, that feels good.  On a separate note: it was graduation weekend and we had a lot of trouble to find an outside place to have a drink and snack/dessert on Friday night. Relatively sad enough, we found only Olive Garden open with its terrace. They wouldn't serve us food outside, but we could get it inside and then move outside. Ok, sure, we can do that. Now, we get the stuff and we get out, sitting pacifically by ourselves and after 15 minutes one of the waiters is out saying that they cannot let people be outside after 11pm!!! What?! U gonna be kidding me! A group of a dozen Americans that were there, went very obediently inside. We stayed there with complete aplomb. What was the worst to happen? That they would close the door on us...in that case we had only to jump the low fence out! And yes, the locked us out, after a while the manager came to ask us to move inside and we declined "the offer" again and at the end, even reentered the restaurant to get out. Pennsylvania is one of the craziest places to live in... Seriously.

      Today has been relatively productive till now...but what awaits me in the evening is grocery shopping with the future in-laws:Tiger will be still playing golf! What shall I say, the idea is not exciting me even a little bit (I just deleted a whole paragraph elaborating on the idea!). On the other hand, I will be here till six/sevenish to finish preparing the solution...no, neither are fascinating ideas to entertain my brain with. ... I think it is amazing how every time I listen to some really nice classic music I lose myself in my thoughts. Any of Beethoven symphonies would to the job. Mozart usually kind of wakes me, but it is just another kind of daydreaming. And I just realized that I need a new fiction book to read...right now I am just reading "Iran": a 1975 edition of a touristic guide to Iran. Just to improve my French, although it would help much more if I would look up in a dictionary the words I don't know. The point is that my biggest problem with French is the pronunciation (Tiger used to say at the beginning that I had a Chinese accent!). Though I have an excellent trick to sound perfectly "Parisian": put ur index and middle fingers on the two side of ur mouth when it is closed, now talk French without opening your mouth more than what ur fingers would allow U! Believe me it works fantastically well...the only side-effect is of course that U would look ridiculous though ur accent would be absolutely divine!

      I was thinking I should say a word about the fact that  urlLink Umberto Agnelli died  , but then I thought that I should have said at least a word about the  urlLink earthquake in Iran  too... But I can not find anything really politically correct or sincere enough to write. The few lines above are more than enough. My apologies to anybody who could feel offended by that, but sometimes not saying anything is better.

      ...I would say Bagel (like the dog in the commercial saying "Bacon"!). Well, of course even though we went to bed late last night/this morning, I woke up early as always. But I just felt so S-LOW! Kind of by chance, I remembered I had to prepare again the solution and even if I skipped the "breakfast", I still wasn't at work before 9. By the time I finished the setup and let the first stage begin, it was already 10. So I come downstairs to the measurements lab and I found a nice selection of specialty bagels from Panera, butter and cheese cream on the table. Barb is truly an angel (sometime she worries me in her role of mom: how did she I didn't have breakfast?!?!?! Angel makes much more sense in this case!)... I devoured the first one, without much realizing I have done so. For the rest of the morning coming in and out of that room, I have been repeatedly seen with pieces of bagel in hand. Quick calculation: 1 bagel = 550 Calories ca. I ate almost 2, when putting all the pieces together... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh! That's bad...very bad. I feel very guilty (also superficial, but the guilt is right now prevalent!). Anyway, one more hour and I am out of here. Biking from home to here and back should also help. Tiger's response to my confessions was "well, if U feel sooo guilty: 2hrs of gym tonight". What does he know? He went to work at 11!!!!! I feel dead! 2 hours of gym, right! Not more than 40 minutes! ... I am very bad: I was thinking again about all the different bagels and how good they tasted! Gnam!

      That's what it ended to be last night. We begun too early (8:30 was the time set!) at the Big Easy and the barman/waiter was soooo rude. So just a couple of people got drinks while we were waiting for Steve to get his pizza. We left then for Chili's bar to get some margaritas, but it was kind of full, so we moved on for Allen St Grill, stayed there a couple of hours then decided to go play darts at The Darkhorse and both the darts were taken, so a couple of drinks later we went to the Zeno's, when once a drunk Steve was able to win. Amazingly he wins everytime at Zeno's when he gets a bit more than tipsy ;) So it was fun and we all had a great time. Actually met Harika, this Turkish/American girl whose parents used to study at SC and so she was born here and now she is back for her Masters here where she was born. Very nice girl... Sean of course is kind of lost and I am not seeing much chance of his situation getting any better. Well, she is nice anyway and so we will keep in contact. As Sean put it "Harika and Nazanin has definitely more chemistry than I can ever can hope to have with her"...Will see, who knows after all. actually it was funny, because me, Tiger and Sean were kind of discussing them (Sean and Harika) on the way to Big Easy, (like what he has done right and what wrong, I mean from the female point of view), when at the certain point Tiger is like "Isn't she over there?" and yes, it was "she" over there. I really should check the volume of my voice!!!!

      Steve's defense was today. I was walking over to the buses stop that Susan stopped in car and ask me if I wanted a ride and of course I wanted a ride. (It would have been kind of stupid to go to the same place w/o getting the ride from her!). I guess it all went well... and either we get him a bit (ok, maybe a bit more than a bit) drunk tonight or it is gonna be during the weekend...actually the idea of a Saturday BBQ is not bad at all. Let's see how it goes anyway. Besides that it has been a pretty eventless day...Had about time to have 6 runs on a sample from Japan before setting up a 2hours long experiment and run for Steve's defense. When I came back (it was one of those "open to questions during the talk" that I hate! It took almost 2hrs to finish the presentation before getting to the real question session!) I set the new experiment before looking at the data already collected and I discover that it has all failed 15 minutes after the setup! Great! To top it all, the room was so full of people and the sample and setup so sensitive to any kind of vibration that it was impossible to reset it ASAP. So the new experiment (or the re-run of the last one) is still there and at 5 I have to close my stuff anyway because somebody else is signed up! ... "DO NOT COMPLAIN"!!!! ...(that was just to myself!) :) smile... Aaaahhh, already better! let's get back to work now that I feel a bit better (I am not really sure if I feel better because I complained anyway or because after all that I convinced myself to smile!?! Whatever...)    ...still smiling ;)

      So I got " urlLink orkut "ed too. Although turns out to be still kind of useless for me... The only friends I have from when I used to live in Iran, either have got married or are not on the list (I have lost contact, how do I send them the invitation!). My friends from Italy, can't care less about internet connections: we still use to email once a year or phone calls all over the year plus I see them when I go back for holidays. so, the only use remains with keeping in touch with my group of friends that are ending their studies and therefore their permanence in this town. I will finish next year too, so at least I may keep contact with them and the group will keep the contact too. ... If anyone wants to join, give a sign...

      Or said in other word: done many things, yes, can say productive half-day till now, but I have done only half of the things on my agenda. Which means that this afternoon is going to be super jammed with other things to do. I guess my biggest problem is that I have too many things to do and I can not really make myself prioritize them. I mean, I make a list and I say I have to do this 200 (ok, let's make it 20 to keep it real!) different things to do. But then I try to do the first 5 together and I end up doing just a little bit of everything if I am lucky. More often it happens that I am in the middle of something and then I remember something else that is outside that list of top 20 but that last week was somewhere very close to the top of the list, so I go back and try to take care of that, but in the middle of this one also something else and so on forever...well, almost forever. The day ends at some point! So right now I am in the middle of one of these crazy periods of "Help, can not concentrate on a single thing and have 2000 (yes, I continue to change orders of magnitude here!) things to do and I can't finish all of them. Tiger tells me that I just ask sometimes too much from myself and that everybody is in the same situation but they just don't mind if they don't take care of everything ASAP. Some of the deadlines are made to be broken. Well, I can not simply do it... Hmmmm...this was a true rambling, wasn't it?! Sometimes I wonder if I just type so fast to keep up with my mind or just I am plain crazy. Usually I accept the second option. Hasta la vista & a bientot! I just remembered 2 more things to add to the list (which BTW has even a physical presence on my task manager and calendar on Outlook!).

      Nanana.... Ok, I feel a bit in the singasong mood, so what?! I have had a my daily dose of personal auto-destructive thoughts about my research (last night sometime around 1am in the bed!), I have been working almost all morning on the article, I have also been answering the emails and now I can take ten minutes off to write a post! So, the weekend actually went pretty well. The Bay shores are always beautiful. I already want to go back sailing. The food was great and I have put on half a pound (gym at least 3 times this week!). The weather was as humid and hot as U could expect from Chesapeake Bay in late June, but hey who can command the weather anyway?! I forgot at home, my jean short and my light jacket so I was warm during the day and cold when we would go out at night (1 of the problems of making your luggage half an hour before U leave!). The pump at the swimming pool was broken, so no 50 laps in the swimming pool, but I got tanned anyway: problematically only on the face and the arms, so now I look like a truck driver (hurray! Right!). Ioanna has left this morning :( But she is coming back for at least a couple of weeks in August :) She has left some of her stuff with us. Not even the four lagguage combined of hers and her moms could contain all of her things (besides all she donated to Goodwill and similars!). Now, who I will go shopping with when I'll have horrible days at work?!?! The future-in-laws are leaving tomorrow morning for Newport, Rhode Island and Cape Code and are coming back this weekend, which means we won't go to the rafting trip with Eve and her nephew. My suggestion of bringing the Tiger parents with us what considered with a funny frown on the face!!! Ehm...ok, maybe we won't consider that! And now I am going back to the article writing... Nanana...nanana... Na nana na na nah... Nananah

      I wouldn't say I am really superstitious, but I guess I am somehow... everytime I say "It is going well" (especially work-wise!!!) something happens. Happened again. Tuesday I was talking to a friend and I was asked how the research was going and I was all happy and went out and say "oh, good. Everything is going fine. If I can make another big step this summer, everything is just on schedule for my graduating on time, bla bla". As soon as I confirmed I was depressed with my research anymore, all kind of stuff happened with the results from the samples in the lab. Now I am getting even contradictory results from the experiments. I can not believe it. And I still am thinking why it didn't work and have made up half a dozen theories on why and how and stuff. One of the theories is that all my work till this point is just BS (though I am trying to keep this one as last choice, it still bothers me!).  PS. Note the detachment of the tone...I am still skeptic about it all!

      Ok, so I came by chance to know that Andrea is looking around for the costs of the wedding, the wedding lists and the people to invite... And he writes to me last Monday (I kept to my self-promise of not writing anymore unless he makes himself alive again!): yes a nice, cheery email, that actually made me smile (his latest emails and behavior have been  urlLink very "not-nice"  ). In his email, there is no mention of anything...He barely says that "T. is at work today".  Well, I am not supposed to care right? Well, turns out that I don't completely not care...Complex sentence? Complex feelings! I don't know. It's just that hearing these news second-handed sent a pang to my heart. Just that: a pang and then it was gone. I had still to answer the email, so while I was writing back, well...again "pang"...this time shorter. And then a smile lights up on my lips thinking about the time we were together...and another smile thinking of Tiger. And realizing that it has been more than two years now. Time flies when U r with people U love, right?! I guess so... This log came out different than what I wanted to at the beginning, but I am just writing what come to my mind (otherwise the ramblings won't be so random, right!?!). I just find it amusing that my feelings for Andrea are the ones for a b...ok, maybe not exactly a brother, but it's just that close (or this far!) from. Pang or no pang...it's just we shared and grew so much together, though we both moved on and have different lives now. We had something special then and the point is that beyond being in past tense it was also special. Cheers to the people that have been important in our lives. And a couple more cheers to people that are still ;) ... Gee, though I won't get invited, I would have made such a nice best-man and a great speech! ;)

      Thanks guys for the notes for the blogs of the weekend. The ramblings of my mind are tuned again to more positive vibrations ;) Am not sure if it is for the sun and outside BBQ of Sunday, spiking the ball while playing volleyball, because it's me and Tiger having sometime by ourselves again, the prospect of a party tonight or simply that I have decided to get a hair cut...I bet that having a few lines dropped by friends is not weightless either :D Do U see the smile?! :D :D :D Yeah, it's me!!!!!

      *So Aylin defended today too. It's just so nice when U go to some of these presentations and see that "Hey, I was thinking about this problem or I had that question that this committee member is asking" or that U would have the answer to a question that somebody is asking. Kind of empowering. Anyway, Tiger's parents are in Philly today and tomorrow, so we can go to the gym (hurray!!!! Yes it is nice to eat at all these nice restaurants but kind of depressing on ur line!) and later to Aylin's defense party too :)   *I was thinking that it was a bit of a weird thing that they didn't ask the general audience to leave after their questions. Usually the committee tortures the candidate by their own for a couple of hours. But they, maybe Nuclear Engineering is different from Materials Science or Electrical Engineering.  *The morning was lost, but in the afternoon I had time even to do a bunch of measurements...it doesn't seems that they really confirm what I have seen till now, but hey, I will find the reason why anyway. Well, at least I will try ;)  *So after three weeks of thinking about cutting my hair (were supposed to do it with Ioanna, but then she was sooo busy before leaving that there wasn't definitely enough time for going to the "beauty salon"!), I finally decided to do it today. The first available time is for next Monday at 8:30am!!! Some times I wonder why do I bother with these things...To get an appointment to go to cut my hair!!! Hah....whatever!  *Yes, sooner or later I will make a schematic of who is who friend-wise and what they do and how all of us are connected. Sooner, or more porbably later.

      Sometimes I should remind myself that listening to "adagios" just weighs U more down instead of picking U up... Sometimes I should also remind myself that my life is just beautiful and that I shouldn't feel sad. My mom would say "Khoshi zadeh zireh delet..." But it's just that sometimes, sometimes I feel like sitting in a place, with my adagios, hug my knees and let myself go. Let myself cry out all the stupid things about which I shouldn't care. I shouldn't be so sensitive...right, I shouldn't be so sensitive. I should keep smiling and be nice. And people would continue to think of me as a "solar" one. Well, so guess what: I feel very lunatic right now. I have the right to feel sad too, I have the right to be in a bad mood like everybody else! Is it my fault if they have this perfect idea of happy girl?! ... and the worst thing is that I feel guilty to be sad. I feel bad that I feel bad.  Don't want to answer back, don't want to be rude, don't want to show a "this-is-a-fake-smile" to say "U-R-boring". I just do it and I feel bad in the same instant. Damn it... after all, maybe I am nice inside. It's just sometimes it takes too much energy to be nice and I am soooo tired. The blue sky, the fluffy white clouds, the green grass moved by the breeze, the colorful flowers seem all to mock me... And in a very anti-climax moment the adagio turns allegretto. Sigh...not even the music is letting me sad. Let's get out of here...

      Tired, tired soul.  Weighs me down.  Breathing under water,  rushing and burning in my lungs. The music softly plays and tears run down my face. And sadness, sadness in my heart, heavy with a burden I can't see. Burn my bones but no cry to quench my soul. This tired,  tired soul.

      ...remember that this morning I had something I really wanted to write about here. I have forgotten what it was. I have been busy all day without really concluding that much. Like the whole afternoon spent in the lab upstairs, checking samples and trying to get more than a set of data out of them and they would break one by one but not really the moment U begin the test, but right at the end, right before U can put them back in the system and get the data out. Whatever...at least this time I had brought my laptop with me and used the time to write down an email and could also listen to my CD. Have I already said that I love Beethoven?! No? Yes? Well, here I say it again. I love Beethoven. And yes, I was funny when in between, running down- and upstairs, I would continue to whistle to myself tunes of the CD. It's not that I am really happy, it's just that I love this music. Kind of reminds me of the childhood in Iran. Having interesting parents, make U a funny kid I guess. Could recognize the music of the different classic composer but have no clue who was Mofid. I remember that once a girl was trying to make fun of me and Bahar and she was giving us all these names of Iranian singers we didn't know, well, till she said Mofid. Bahar looked at her and said "No, we know Mofid. Farhang-eh Mofid". Right, thought not exactly the same! It also reminds of the nights without electricity, with the gas light on, trying to finish the homework. And of my parents that would play games with us or just would talk about their childhoods and memories. Maybe all these reveries are just due to the fact that in orkut today I found someone from the elementary school in Iran. I admit, I barely remember her face and I wasn't even sure it was she. Sure enough it was: I received back a nice message that was asking how Bahar was doing too.  She even remembered Bahar's name. Oh well, they all remember her name I guess. I skipped the 4th year at the elementary school so after that in the new class, everybody already knew Bahar and we were Bahar & Nasy. Ahhhh...too many memories and one is right at the top of the other and I am just a little bit over-whelmed right now. Has been already a long day.

      even in  urlLink Orkut ! Ok, so I guess anyone that is a member of Orkut has received by now at least a couple of invitations for adding friends from completely unknown people. My approach is that I check out their profile, if there is nothing that upsets me I add them as "never met" the lowest end of the scale of friendship and then send them an email asking why they have added me and whether we know eachother. Now the etiquette would dictate that the other person should answer back, responding to the questions even if they don't know me either or if they just found it funny to add me. It's just politeness that asks U to answer a message or a question. Now I am sending out an "ultimatum" (gee, how American does that sound!) to these people: they are going to be deleted from my list if they don't answer. Is this too unpolite of me?!?!

      "With all its shame, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world". This was from Max Ehrmann  "It is a beautiful world even when U see it through dark smoky glasses and everything seems just gray. Afterall, gray is such a chic color ;)"  (I came here to write something a bit sad and then I thought "why should I? Let's write something a shade nicer!")

      Isn't that wonderful?! And though it is very humid (today's forecast: showers and thunderstorms) and relatively hot...well, what is that "though" doing in the sentence?! I am awake but very sleepy. I guess that's fine as long as I have just some runs to do upstairs that don't really need my supervision (which actually could mean that I will feel more bored and sleepy!). So last night was fine. The  urlLink movie  was ok...Actually I shall say I was disappointed. The book is SOOO MUCH nicer than the movie, which basically runs only around the last 50 pages of the book itself. The characters are soul-less and not well represented, many relegated to the background when they are not in the book. Tiger's response to all this was "You see: I am right not to read the book and now I am not disappointed!". At the end we made even a run for the Meyer's Dairy to get a milkshake or icecream. Well, we got all the lights red. ALL OF THEM, so we arrived at 10:38pm and they have already closed the counter :( No milkshake!!!! Whatever...we just dropped Bernd at his place and went back home. Talked a bit while sitting outside and then went to bed sometime around midnight. Poor Max had to go back to Williamsport and has to wake up by 5:45am. Well, I tried to be a nice host and get up too. I made in time to wash the dishes from yesterday, but by the time Max was out of the shower I was literally falling asleep with my head in the sink. The "Wow, U look fresh today!" from Max was enough for me to get my clue. I gave him a hug, said goodbye till tomorrow probably and went back to bed :P Even a Gufona needs sleep ;)

      Well, one has to get over stuff that happen anyway (this philosophy is usually embraced after a good night of sleep!). Ok, the bracelet is lost and there is not much that I can do anymore about it. It is bad enough that I lost it, it would be even worse if I let it drag me down for too long. And so what if the Pistons were on the verge of winning and humiliating the Lakers for the second time but they lost. After all they have still two home games to come! Afterall, today I have two time slots to work with two different instruments and that is already good. And then tonight Max is coming over and with him, Bernd and Steve we are going to watch Harry Potter (either I am good if I can drag 4 guys to watch the third Harry Potter movie >:) or these just simply people I have a lot in common. Ehm, now that I think about it, the second idea seems more plausible!). And I have already knocked/touched the wood. It is an oppressive low nineties but extremely humid outside and I guess I will take my time to do the experiments inside with the AC on :) Well, better get going... The "word" for the day: "Do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness."

      ...I decided that I really needed a rest. Tiger went to pick me up at lunch. We went home, had a small lunch and I went to bed at around 1:30-2:00. Guess what?! I woke up at 4:30. Am I good or what? If U were going to say "just tired", shush! I am not really sure how much of it actually was really being tired, cause I am still tired, the headache is less but still there and my limphatic nodes are still swollen and hurting. BTW, I called even the CATAbus services and no they haven't found any bracelet. I have double checked the bedroom, bathroom and second bedroom, all my cloths and the walk-in closet. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Sorry, I was falling asleep again. What was I saying? Have I said anything at all? No? Ah, can go back to...well maybe not the bed, but at least the sofa. I can always go to work tonight after dinner :)

      I have a headache and I am almost falling asleep on my desk. the bad news is that with the headache I am giving up depositing samples today (hope U never get to smell sol-gel stuff!) I would screw up everything. the good news is that I set up another Tc experiment to run (the one I did yesterday didn't exactly work out right) and that also bill Drawl (he is one of the tech stuff here and I can say that he is definitely one of greatest persons I have ever met here. He is very open-minded, smart, extremely helpful and modest on the top of everything. Considering that I have already adopted two moms and two grandsons here, he could be a good uncle to adopt!...hey, that was a long parenthesis!) has found me a whole solenoid system. Turns out that the one I was given actually belongs to the Nanofab Facility's system to be repaired. That one almost missed all the connections, pipelines and stuff: this one has everything! :) :? Funny, I was just thinking that if somebody sees me right now will think I'm on a drug or something. My eyes are half closed (yes, definitely falling asleep) and this very stupid sided smile on my face. Hope nobody comes into the office right now... If anybody is wondering now about the title of this post...well, I can only say that our goals are not always met! We can just strive more ;)

      I lost my bracelet. I hate losing stuff, especially things that have an extra personal value into them. This one was a beautiful bracelet that I got as graduation gift the last week before leaving Italy when I first came here :(( I want my bracelet back... I don't know even when or where I may have lost it. I just know that as soon as we got into the gym I thought that it has been so long since last time (geee, it was only last week!!! Seems months to me!) that I have forgotten I take off everything (only jewelry-wise I mean). And then I looked and AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, the bracelet was missing. Very sad gufona ;((

      ...and begins with me cutting my hair! No, I don't have a short military cut now :P I just needed a decent cut considering that I haven't touched the hair since Last Xristmass. Ah, it feels good! And It took me more than hour and a half to write my weekly report to Susan. And the results are slightly improving (touching wood! Did I do it right  urlLink Kimia ?). Now I have a brand new week in front of me to work hard ...huhah! I really think sometimes that it is not that I am going nuts, I am already completely nuts!  And gym...need to go back to the gym: this evening, yes! Am I weird or what? People go to get their hair done right before the weekend begins so they can flaunt it around and feel good about it. I cut my hair and come to the lab to close it up in a knot and work in the sol-gel lab and then to go to the gym! I am really nuts. And the future-in-laws left yesterday. Though I had been feeling much better with them last week, I still admit that it feels good to have the home back to ourselves :P (bad girl!) I definitely improved my manners to a good level by the time they came back from Philly... Gee, makes me wonder how the hell I expect to have kids?!?! I can not imagine if anybody behaves with me as a frustrated teenager. It's good to know that I have still many years before I have to worry :D  Oh, BTW, about the award thing...keep your mouths shut: besides our families no-one knows still! ;) [I was wondering once again what's wrong with me: I get engaged and don't tell anyone, I get awards and don't tell anyone...hmmmm, anybody knows a shrink by chance?!]

      Well, not in the sense of pulling my legs under me, saying OMHHHHHH or stuff like: just thinking (Yes, I DO think...sometimes, rarely, ok?! But I think!).  Yesterday was definitely a bad day. Bored to hell but like a tight spring. I don't know how to describe it... Mmmm, imagine a ball of fire with an explosive center: crimson and gold, roaring up unexpectedly one moment and subdueded the next. Now close it in a very very thin ball of crystal. You got it? Fragile like hell, threat it with velvet gloves. The ball is just there: if you push it it might even roll, but r u really sure U want to try that?! Not even going to the gym helped: I felt like punching something: kick-boxing would have been perfect. Oh, but during the summer semester not everything is available! Daaaaaaaah. I continued to have this image in my mind: a face, unknown, and then my fist smashing into it and blood would be everywhere. Don't bother analyzing the repressed feeling/emotions. When getting out of the gym I told Tiger this, he looked at me a bit perplexed and said "U want to try with my arm?" (sweet thing, ah?!) No, wouldn't have been the same. Besides, I won't ever be able to hit him. Now, it is back... It is almost as bad as yesterday. I have left the sign of my fingernails all over my palms. Sometimes having genetically great nails is a disadvantage. Yes, they looked as if U had just got out of the manicure even if U haven't touched them since last time they got cut, but at the same time, it really hurts if U are trying to control ur inside anger! I am angry and I don't now why! DAMN! It's not even the bets moment to do experiments (yes, I had two spare hours to spend in the lab to do some measurements. The life of a PhD candidate can be depressing at times!). Which reminds me of the results of the thinking: I am a social animal by birth. Kind of like my mom, plus the hurricane of my dad. Now put that together with the pretty eventless past weeks! Can't stand it anymore: working from early morning to 5-6 pm in the lab. No lunch break besides when I am analyzing data at the computer, while biting an apple and listening to the Euro2004 game live. The back home, a shower, reading a book (Don't read The Pillars of Earth, definitely not worth ur time!), talking to Tiger. Then maybe watch something on TV (NBA till there were those), to bed at around midnight. Waking up at 3am, thinking about things that need to be done and things that should have been done and... Stressed? Sure. But I always stress myself. This time it is a bit more than that: I am angry! And bored! Angry and bored at the same time: awful combination. I will get better...  But right now, I am in one of those moods U better not come that close!

      Your opinions are important to me.  I care about your ideas.  I want to understand what goes in your mind.  If you talk to me, I will talk to you. I will even talk if you don't. I just want to understand...you.  I just want to share, to be part of it. Friends are like that.  Don't shut everything out with a "all that doesn't matter...am I wrong?"  I care.  (well, all this is almost always true besides when I have my moments of craziness: sometimes I go completely nuts and there is no way to reason with me. I will tell U so at that point so U won't use energy and emotions to deal with me!)

      I am really done with staying in the lab for today! I am getting out of here: I don't care even where I go. Probably home: walking and reading my book (The Pillars of the Earth, Ken Follet... BTW, I was kind of expecting more from the book.)... I was even hoping that Premier theaters would show Fahrenheit 9/11: the have backed off. Any other nice movie out there that we should see? ( urlLink U  &  urlLink U  thinking about Shrek2: NOOOOO!).  So, we'll see... We'll planning on having this BBQ on Sunday at our place with some of our friends: hopefully the whole weekend and the BBq will pick me up some. Can U believe I am not even staying here to listen to the Italy-Sweden game?! I am really celerbrally gone! I hereby declare my mental death at 2:00pm. AMEN!

      It's one of those grey days: cloudy, warm and humid. One of those days that U enter the office, say hi and nobody even tries to answer back. I want to get just out of the lab and go do something for myself: I am thinking gym or shopping! Where is my companion in crime Ioanna?! I guess she is just laying under the beautiful sun on some gorgeous Cypriot beach or shopping in some high-fashion store.  My working energy is close to zero...by which i mean it's somewhere in the negative zone, but because I have already set-up an experiment, it is not so much below zero. I can not believe I just gave an explanation on how much below zero is my energy! It means I am really in bad shape. Which means I should consider much more going to the gym instead of going shopping. It is Friday damn it! I want to do something...something different instead of being caught up here working!

Oh, well, to make it kind of worse, more songs of Antonacci come into my mind and I catch myself whistling them aaround the lab and singing them to myself when I am walking up and down the stairs back and forth between office and labs. "MI FAI STARE BENE MI FAI STARE BENE E DI STARE BENE NON MI STANCO MAI MI FAI STARE BENE, MI FAI STARE BENE sembri l'alba di un mondo...CHE SIAMO NOI" and this one: "Non ci credevo, ho detto: "è lei! o no?" tra tanti amici non ti aspettavo qui solita sera e la solita tribù tu che mi dici: stai sempre con i tuoi? e ti accompagnava, un emozione forte e ti accompagnava ancora, la solita canzone..." and this one too: "Iris tra le tue poesie ho trovato qualcosa che parla di me le hai scritte tutte col blu su pezzi di carta trovati qua e là  dimmi dove, dimmi come......... e con che cosa ascoltavi la mia vita, quando non stavo con te.............. e che sapori e che umori che dolori e che profumi respiravi, quando non stavi con me.............. iris mi viene da dirti .......... ti amo e lo sai, non l'ho detto mai" Hey, just found this small piece of  urlLink Iris  in Spanish (in Spanish?!?! Where is the Italian?!?!). Anyway... Sciabada'... shall I translate the tests?!

      I am getting really fed up with Yahoo. Since the beginning of this week and its new format and memory has hundreds of connection problems. Half of the time not even the messenger gets connected and the other half, I can't access my mail anyway. Someone tell me plz what's the advantage of having so much more memory if U can not access it anyway!

      Well,  urlLink Totti got suspended . I guess it is well deserved and I guess everybody supporting the Italian team now feels (a bit at least) ashamed for his conduct too. Sometimes, there is a single fact that has the force of turning us from a stubborn support to a more open-minded reasoning. I guess for me this behavior of Totti made it. Just looking back at the Denmark-Italy game, it's amazing how many faults were committed and how many players got the yellow card. I am not repudiating the Italian team all together. I just admit that maybe they just don't deserve so much unconditional support! So, "Vive la France" today! Whatever happens, they have been playing well and correctly at least till this point...maybe they will also overcome their "french-ness". ... Yes, Tiger made a huge difference in this swing too!

      I haven't still bragged about Lakers losing the Championship finals?! I should really have done this earlier :D :D :D And let me just add another one :D I just feel kind of sorry for Shaq: among all those narcissist, egocentric people, he seems to be the only one that is just a good guy.

      You remember that I  urlLink said something  about Lili Gruber, the great anchorwoman in Italy that quit her job in opposition to Berlusconi's politics?! Well, now  urlLink she wins  a seat in Rome for the European parliament with almost twice as many votes as the premier. Oooohhh, makes me happy :D Italian leftist parties have been lacking the outstanding figure that could rally the people behind. Maybe now they have found a new face for it!   Just for Bidel, to whome I have promised not to ask to translate anything in Italian: "In Berlusconi's face"...though it sounds abit less hard in Italian.

      Finally a good reason to not feel frustrated when U speak two languages and U know that can never quite express yourself fully without either of the other language/s U speak! Check out  urlLink BBC's article on bilinguals  (even better if U r tri-lingual I guess!).

      I read this on the  urlLink official Euro2004 website .  (BTW, the Norwegian is the Norwegian referee Terje Hauge.  "My son saw me refereeing for the first time," the Norwegian recalled. "When we were driving home, suddenly he said to me: 'I was very disappointed with your refereeing today.' I was surprised to hear this from a five-year-old, and asked him why. 'Well,' he replied, 'you were running and running, but you didn't catch up with the ball all day!' I still smile at his comments now!" Doesn't a comment like that make a dad's day?!

      One day U know all these people just from what they write and they are only nicknames behind which a real face is hidden and in the turn of a few days, turns out that everybody has a photo somewhere on the web! Like mushrooms they come out... Photo, full name, birthdays,... Google is bad! Or no, Google is not bad. I am bad! Why did I have to get into this googling people? Now, I have these pictures of people in front of my eyes when I write and it's not the same anymore. I guess the only ones that didn't make a difference w or w/o the photos were  urlLink Negar  and  urlLink Hossein . Or maybe it was different with them because of what they write about or how they write it. I don't know why, but it has been a distressing experience.

      Doesn't make much sense. I am not a big soccer fan, but everytime the world Championships or the European Championships come out, I become this big fan that has to know the results and see the actions and cheers and stuff. Which doesn't just agree with my being just to much easily stress-able (I can't remember when was the last time I played at a computer game or watched somebody playing at them!). The game just stresses me so much that at the end, I am not able to watch always.  If it ever comes to penalties, I am completely torn between watching and feeling that I am going to die if I watch. Thanks  urlLink BBC  that broadcast live the commentary to the games. Although I have to keep myself from commenting till a couple hours later.  urlLink Negar  is watching the games with one hour delay.

      Well, yes sure, now I understand why I couldn't log on to my yahoo mail this morning. They were updating it to the 100MB promised. I am not really sure how much I like this new interface. Specially because of all the error messages that it gives and the hang ups and also the fact that it is soooo slow. Will elaborate later maybe... (ehm,  urlLink Kimi , U were right. I say a lot of times maybe!).

      ...I know there is a place I could put my drafts in, I just save them instead of deleting them once I decide not to publish them right then and there. And I write, things that otherwise I wouldn't have had. Is that bad or good. Just wondering... And I know perfectly that I wouldn't ever post them on Gufona: there is too much of ME in it. It's not Gufona, just me. And it scares me to put it out there...  I really hope I will get over it and drop them in.

      I have at least three emails to write (emails that need thinking, not just the "how U doing" kind!), so many experiments that I woke up again at 3am this morning to freak out about them all and I remembered during those sleepless hours that I have to do some more stuff that I have been neglecting recently. Bad girl! She has to work now, pretty hard. Back to work! ... Tiger yesterday just convinced me to be on France's side...Well, this till they were losing. With my Italian side a bit still hurting form the 2000 finals, I couldn't quite agree to that till I so him so torn and sad. I turn to him and say "Ok, U know U convinced me. I actually want France to score".  GOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL, cried the guy from BBC radio. Zidane has done it again... :D  -"I told U...as soon as I said I wanted them to score..." -"It's wasn't really for U, U know"... PENALTY! -"What? These French thieves, they always come out at the last seconds and steel away the game..." GOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL -"I don't think I am for France anymore!" :( -"Oh, I don't care. We won". Men become extremely weird when their favorite sport is going on. ... On a separate note: the Lakers lost again. Mmmmmmm, oh how good that feels! :) ... On a last sportive note: I am getting better in Golf ;)

      Ok, so now I have deleted already my lines for the third time and am back to the white board. Shall I say bored instead?! Because I am really bored. I mean I have to wait every time 20 minutes + for the poling of this sample before hoping to get any data out of it and not always that 20+ minutes give any answer either and in the meanwhile I do other stuff. This morning when talking to my mom on the phone, she gave me the brilliant idea of (well, yes, I have already thought about it but...) beginning to write anyway. I mean to write my thesis, which I was supposed to do anyway this summer. The point is thought the idea is brilliant, there is no will to put it into act, considering that this lab is windowless, therefore the time is kind of standing still there and considering that I need the "right mood" to write otherwise my brain freezes! So I am now sitting here...one of the few souls that at 1:30pm of a wonderful Saturday afternoon has decided to spend her time in the meandering dark corridors, offices and labs of this building. No wonder though that among these few lost souls, three are part of the same group! Me, Mustafa and Dr cheng! As far as I know there was only one other person that left 10minutes after I arrived. Lulled by the humming of the electronic instruments, my fingers dance on the keyboard and my brain says the last adieu-s. Goodbye, goodbye and the connection with my brain is lost...maybe forever. (Can I say Maybe Kimi? Please, please, please?!) While the fingers push themselves further to stroke the keys, I wonder why am I still letting them go around and push letter after letter to write things I don't even to write. The simple answer coming out of my ear (now that the brain doesn't work anymore, I had to find something else to give me answers!): because U R BORED!!!!! Whatever... now U really know, beyond reasonable doubt that I am gone nuts... adieu. "MAYBE" Ill be back.

      The whole day I have been waiting to get a bit of time so I could come and sit by myself to write what has been going in my mind. Of the smallness of people and the pettiness of their acts, the stress of the grad student life, of an advisor that punctual as a Swiss clock (maybe it's the influence of her being in that country!) every Friday before leaving work, gives me stuff to do for the weekend. Whatever... the day is over, even France is getting out of the tournament and the whole day has been spent in the lab, literally watching the numbers change on the electronic display while the measurement was in progress... But then, right before getting here, I stopped by a friend's page and I thought I won't write sad words (yes, I know I did: shush!). It's just I don't even find words of comfort either. I have been there...If not exactly the same place, somewhere extremely close and it doesn't feel good, I know. Hang in there. "In neez bogzarad."

      Susan has her access to email back if not her computer (Anyone out there still boasting about MACs being perfect and never crashing?! Anyone? :P ). Which means I have been busy as a bee since I have came to work this morning. And although I have a lot of stuff I would love to write a bout, all I will be writing about are nonlinear higher harmonics and phases and amplitudes and stuff like that... It's going to be another long report! Hasta la vista... (as a personal note: definitely not enough time to watch the Portugal/England game today! Sigh!)

      Well, U need to open ur inbox and find an email from a dear old friend that says right in the first paragraph that his email has to make ur day to know how nice it was :) And this very bad Gufona has even forgotten to call or send an email for his birthday. For some reason in this weird brain of mine "6 Maggio" is not really equivalent to "May 6". So, yes, I realized only on 17th of May that his birthday has come and gone. I felt then so ashamed that I never wrote (who writes anyway two weeks late to say, sorry I forgot about ur birthday!)...Actually the point is really that: I never forget about the birthdays. I just don't realize which day it is. I mean, every morning I have to trace back what I have been doing since the weekend to make sure what day it is (typical cases of Wednesdays that turned out to be Thursday and Wednesdays that were Tuesdays, etc!) Unfortunately I am serious... I mean, once U come to work in the lab, everyday is like the other. It's not like going to school and knowing ha today I have Latin or tomorrow there is the Math exams and so on so forth. It's not even like I have any regular, day-based extra-curricular activities. Well, maybe besides the Friday's volleyball, but even that hasn't ever been regular.  Today I was so surprised to discover that it was the 23rd of June. I have only one month left to wrap up everything before Susan is back! Help, help, help.... Need to get more things done. Back to work now... Oh, I have forgotten that I have already a sample under measurement. Ok, so now I wait...

      (For those of U, not speaking Farsi: the title literally means something like "the mouse that has been "fished" out of water"). I got caught ina thunderstorm. For the first time in many weeks, I went out for lunch. I met Tiger downtown, we had a light lunch and then a coffee, I finally deposited the Fed Tax Refund Check in my account, after that a small walk and then he went  back to his office, while I stopped at the pharmacy to pick up my refills. When walking back towards lab, I got the first drops of rain. Let's walk faster...oh, no: rained harder. So I stopped under one of these elms on campus. At the beginning it was fine, but then it became harder and harder and at the end it was completely useless to stay under the tree, so I just decided to walk anyway... By the time I got to the lab I was completely wet. Well, more dripping than wet! I literally took off the foulard I had around my neck and squeezed it to make a pool of water. Mustafa gave me a ride home...and now everything is out there getting dry...well, trying to get dry. I won't bet on it!

      If I could, I would get now Eunki by neck and give him a nice treatment to teach him respect for other people.  Ok, so the story goes that the week before Susan leaved, we were both in the lab (me and Susan) and she says something about the computers and I say "well, technically we have three computers in this lab that everybody can use. Practically one of them is a MAC, so almost all of us has compatibility issues and another one has been in the group since '98 and the memory is 98 point something full!" and she says "well, I have told Azo (who is the responsible for the computers!) that I have still some money in a couple of funds and if we needed we could get a computer but he said no"... and I am like "what?!?!?!". SO Susan says that I can go on and buy the computer for the lab if we need it. At the end, we opt for a laptop with a docking station, so when any of us has presentations at conferences, doesn't have to go around and beg for a laptop either. Of course, it came at the price of slightly smaller memory than what we could get for a desktop with the same budget. The point being: guys we are not going to install all kind of games and things on this computer which is going to be strictly for work!  Now, Eunki has been co-administrator for the old computers. I remember that when first I came here, he wouldn't let me install yahoo messenger on the computer even though it was the only way I could call home before I got the phone line. Anyway...I let azo and Eunki know the computer has arrived and if they want o take care of installing it, the programs, etc. I get back a flat no. Cause if I have ordered it, I will have to take care of it. Whatever (this more or less explains why I take care of almost all the instruments that I use whether or not they are my responsibility! Thanks god, Ravi was/is different!)... So of course cause I am taking care of everything there, I log in first and I become administrator. A week later, azo comes to me and says that he can not use the MSN  which is although already installed, an older version and bla bla... So, I go there and make the update and it works. The day after Eunki comes and says: "You didn't install the complete Asian fonts and characters!!!". I check later on and it takes 320MB of the memory! No way, kid! It's not gonna happen! Afterall, there are two more computers over there, besides the personal computer U have sitting on ur desk in ur office! At this point he begins yelling at me saying that I want to make it personal. No guy, U don't make it personal to me. After all, did I install anything there that has anything personal to do with it?! I don't see any farsi, not even arab fonts installed. If you want to read the whatever newspaper or blog or web whatever, well, that is personal. Use your own computer, otherwise, to read stuff, U can still use the MAC. His answer was rising more his voice and say "So, I will dlete all the programs that U want to use". My answer was staring back at him. All this two-three weeks ago. Since then he is not even saying hi or not even answering back if I say hi when I get into the office. Whatever, so I don't talk to him either. It is ridiculous and childish, I know. Anyway, now, I have all my old data (the ones from last year and earlier, before I bought my laptop)  that are still stored on the computer in the lab. The policy is that if anybody needs the computer for work, he/she has the precedence on use. So if U are reading jokes on internet, U should have the grace of logging off and letting people work. Which of course he did not. So I ask him how long is it going to take him to finish. The answer? "Loong"!

      what r U doing high in the sky and me, what I am doing in this lab? sometimes I get philosophical, yes! Another Friday is here and I am even less than usual bright. On the other hand, the beautiful sun is bright and up and splending as many other days. I couldn't even get up this morning I was so tired. I am officially extremely tired and I need a rest. Sean has been trying to get us go see Grease at Boalsburg Old Barn, but hey, I can't even get myself watching the movie let apart the whole musical live. I heard something in between the lines about this girl he has met somewhere that is in the play. But sorry dude, just to tired to play the chaperon in the little games around. Anyway...as every Friday, right on time, Susan's email arrived. This time with 25 files as attachments: the results from the measurements on one of my samples!!! It took me a good 10-15 minutes just to download and reformat them. I need desperately a vacation, that's what I need. Time to take off and not think about the research or work or related. Gee, I am almost falling asleep on the laptop now. I am definitely getting old :P like a good wine... Hmmm, that's what I need: a good glass of white wine, a sauterne wouldn't be bad, I could even go with a prosecco, though right now I feel very much like getting a sweet wine. Yes, get my nice glass of wine (ok, with the bottle in the other hand), find a nice place in the shades of some nice trees, somewhere with a nice view. Maybe even some nice music, yes that would help too... Get Tiger along, lay down on the grass and let the breeze caress my face and just relax.... Hmmmm... I can't believe I am relaxing myself just by thinking of getting relaxed. It's like with massages...everytime I give a massage to someone, I get relaxed too... I would sooooooo need the massage too.  I should seriously ask myself if I am masochist: I continue to think about all these things, torturing myself about the fact that I don't have time or I can't afford to spend time like that and then if I even get myself over it and get some time for my own, I end up feeling guilty! What the hell is wrong with me?! Am I getting by osmosis too much from Susan? Now that not only I think about my research under the shower but also wake up in the middle of the night to think about it?! I guess that's it. Sometimes my thoughts go too fast for my hand and I find up I have just finished writing something while I have been thinking about something else. Well, some dozen different things. It's about time they close me in a care house where I can walk around with those cute white long-sleeved shirts. then I won't need to worry so much about working!

      I thought a few times to go back and delete the last post. It's still sitting there, mocking me. After all, it was not meant to be a story re-told, although it has been. Two years past fast. We let our hearts remember what they may, but all in silence. It should have stayed that way, dormant and silent. If bits and bites of memory wouldn't resurface for one reason or another, how would we know we still keep them... Maybe it's good  every now and then to open the dusty drawers in our mind and let a few things see light again.  There is plenty of time to close them back,  right where they were.  Let's hope after all that at the end of all, we'll keep some signs,  some nice bits and bites, that will make us smile or draw a tear, or stir a pain or even sigh, before we go back to our daily routines  and forget them back where they belong.

      ...I still don't know. The impulse of the moment I guess. I didn't mean any more or any less. Some nights, you just know that if you stay by your own, all those doubts and fears and questions will come back to your mind. You need a friend on those nights... You looked at me and said: "are you sure?!" -"I just don't want to be by my own tonight. I just don't want to spend tonight crying". You stayed. We talked. We looked at the old photo albums. We watched even a bit the TV. We laughed and we talked and talked some more. And then you asked me: "I have to ask you something". I raised my head, many questions already in my head: "sure, go on". "You don't need to answer, you know..." "Go on..." "Would you come to the pyramids with me?" ... No, it wasn't what I expected to be asked. And I didn't know how to answer, but I owed you one. "I can't. I'm sorry... You know I can't." My heart broke as I said the words, when I looked in your eyes and saw yours broken too. I wanted to come closer and take your hand, but I did not. I wanted to say yes, but I could not. I wished I could. "I shouldn't have asked." And your eyes, just those big eyes, looking at me minutes ago with brilliant smile, were now filled with tears. Or were they my eyes, those filled with tears? "I stayed so you wouldn't cry. But it was me who made you cry...". You stayed and made those tears go away.  You stayed till I fell asleep. Next morning in front of my door I found a single red rose and a note: "I won't ask you again. I won't make you cry no more. Just let your heart remember the boy that once asked you to go to the pyramids with him."

      ...today after the lunch with Tiger, we went for a short walk on campus and then sat down on a bench just to enjoy the moment and... "Hey, is that guy walking with a cross on his shoulders?" That's how we saw Jesus walking by: in his Penn State worn shirt, his knee brace and old sneakers, sweating gallons under the weight of a big wooden cross. At least he was not chased by Jews and Romans. He made his way up towards the bookstore (I personally think he was going to the Creamery for an ice cream) followed by the stares of his silent audience. Penn State can reserve U some interesting experiences after all!

      Does gingerly remind U of cats and oranges or orange cats by any chance?! Because it reminds me of them! Anyway, sitting gingerly at my desk, I have been working on the article that Susan has sent back to me after reviewing. The figures are done, a few more experiments and I may submit it... I have a couple of journals in mind, but I have still to make up my mind! The desk's surface is covered every day more with samples, and I have still to find the time and will to put some order here. Well, to tell the truth there is an order in the way the things are layed out, the problem is exactly that they are "laid out"!!! I have seriously to begin to work on the thesis and put down at least a list of chapters, but I have already the writer's block. God help me: isn't that a bit too early to have any kind of block?! I was almost going to say my hand doesn't move toward the pen (weird: I guess I was subconsciously translating from "dastam be ghalam nemireh" because it sounds definitely horrendous in English!) that I thought I should say to the keyboard, but then the keys are stricken if anything is appearing here... Too philosophical, I'd better let it be. Hmmm... I am going to make a copy of this guys' thesis. The lad (that is right now a well grown man and an associate professor) had been doing some work that has some similarities with mind and I can use his thesis as a draft key for my thesis's structure. BTW, yesterday I put in serious trouble Barb and her assistant asking them if the plural of thesis was theses (the girl, pardon, have forgotten her name was suggesting theises!)...and they were lost!

      After working a good lot this weekend till complete depression on Saturday and complete ("menefreghismo") I-don't-give-a-damn-anymore-about-it-what-the-hell-state on Sunday that gives its fruit in us ending up at the open swimming poll for the whole afternoon and getting pretty brownish as I have never become in the last 15years, here I am back! Breath... (yes, that was a long sentence, but as Eve says I shoot sentences, referring to my high speed. She also added: "I laughed a lot at ur message on my cell phone, just because of the speed at which U talk. I couldn't really understand anything of what U said!". Sweet!) Anyway, brown and back to work, with my hair in a wavy, curly mess (yes, officially I was called "Wild tigress" this morning!!!) and dressed all in black, which goes so well with the tan, I had a quite interesting morning with an exchange of 6-7 emails back and forth to Switzerland with Susan and the discovery of a good sample. Taken from a zealous desire or call it curiosity, whatever, I checked my samples under the conditions "A" that have so alarmed Susan overseas to the point that she has asked me to perform double and additional experiments "B" on my sample. Having done these ("B")and the results having been pretty agreeable, I thought "doesn't really make sense that if the results of these experiments are good the initial "A" were weird. In fact I check these "A" and everything works great. Tiger's answer to all my perplexities was "Tell Susan that she has been too long out of a lab". So once again, I am sitting in my office on a Monday afternoon asking myself how Susan manages only to ruin my weekends?! On the other hand, this afternoon we tried the new high pressure chamber and hallelujah it works. Well, at the beginning it was not really working but a touch of serendipity solved the problem (MY touch! I almost don't believe it!)... I am still thinking of a nice banana split to appear in front of me, but evidently I can not wish hard enough or my magic powers have left me after their appearance at the high pressure chamber try-out. Hmmm....I am concentrating. Doesn't work. Maybe I should begin with a simple milkshake!

      I am in the "I don't care, I say what's in my mind"-mood. I just sent one of the rudest emails ever to a group of friends, saying that I was not interested in anything they were proposing to do this afternoon/evening. I am utterly  in a helpless bored/rude state. Don't give me ideas about how to be nice today, I may just bite U back for an answer.

      it is 10:30 and I have already been working for 2hrs and have done so many things. I have still so much more to do. Unfortunately it really seems true: I am one of those that feels good when works hard! Although I should have said "when she gets things done" and then dah...that's a no brainer, right?! Everybody is happy when they get lots of things done.  Anyway, I have decided that I have really to get done with this article by the end of the week. (Tiger is at his third article. The situation there is a bit opposite of mine. His advisor is such a turtle in doing things! Not that I am a turtle, but, still...) Anyway, I am a bit pumped up for work and I am marching like a bulldozer...WATCH OUT!!!! Oh, before I go any further I should do a backup of all the data I have stored on my laptop. Tiger was saying that I should have do at least every month. Me...well, haven't ever done it! So I promised I will do a back-up of all my documents today... Here I go... and then  promised: will work on the article. BTW, I have still to begin writing the damn thesis. I continue to procastinate for some reason there. This post is very Zeitoonish as  urlLink Negar  would say. So just to end it nice, this morning I got a ten min call from home. Dad is leaving for Tehran tomorrow and mom...well, she wanted to let me know that my grandma has sent "some money" as a gift for my  urlLink winning the GM-SWE award . :D what shall I say? I win somewhere and get even extra money for winning it :) That's fun!!!!

      After another sleepless night thinking about research, I am back at work. I guess the sleeplessness comes everytime I do or decide to do something for myself and I feel guilty because of that. In this case, me and Eve have decided to take our lunch brakes to spend either at the open swimming pool or at the gym. I don't know why, but recently I feel kind of stressed all the time. I am agitated, nervous and ... I would almost say scared. They say it is normal when U get close and close to the finish line. They say it comes with writer's block. The doubts like "am I doing enough" or "I have still too many experiments to do" or still many more are supposed to come when U decide it is about time to put an end to it. "it" is supposed to be ur life as a grad student. Not that U decide to commit suicide, but just to get finally ur degree and get urself a real job! Real job?! What do U think I have been doing till now, spending even the national holidays in the lab?!  Anyway, the first thing in the morning I found this morning coming to the lab was that "somebody" had burned the wires on the probes!!! Fantastic, just a simple note that reads like this: "the connection of this probe is burned". Well, thank you very much! Not even the decency to sign it. Anyway, I go find Mustafa (responsible of the probe station) and ask him to repair it. I begin to run my own experiments and in the mean time come back to the office to analyze some data. Well, it's weird to have to write to ur advisor for the n-th time and ask her to check again the values she has given U before because they still don't make sense. It even makes U feel weirder when she finally finds out that she has been wrong again. When U find out that basically all those 25 files she has sent U are useless right now...that maybe there is a chance she can figure out all the bugs in the program and give U some way to recalculate everything. It even feels weirder that U have this urgency to have to go somewhere and U haven't still told ur adviser. Maybe because U hope that afterall, there will be a solution out of it. I have this chill in my bones that I can not get rid of. And for once it is not for the AC in MRL. I am just scared and chilled. My smile is till there, it's just a bit more only on the lips and a bit less in the eyes. I know I can make it, I know I have to be strong and get through this and I know... It's just sometimes feels a bit too much!

      ...I have this half sad smile on my face. Maybe it's for watching the best fireworks ever here under a pouring rain last night. Maybe it is staying up till late and discussing Islam and Iran and Hindus and Sikh and International law and politics with friends till late. Maybe it is waking up anyway early this morning and then working downstairs on the data with everybody still asleep upstairs. Maybe it is receiving Susan's emails that apologizes for the errors in her data. Maybe it is my asking her some more questions and her apologizing some more and admitting to be frustrated by some people over in Switzerland. Maybe it is reading in her emails words as "alas" and "what a pain" and I finally think she knows feels how I feel half of the time. It's the half sad smile of sharing your distress with someone that couldn't understand U before. I feel a bit  urlLink Monnalisa  today with her smile, just barely there, a bit enigmatic and a bit sad, just as if I am sharing with no one a funny thing that just passed by my mind.

        I am staying home, working on the data I have ebeen sent by Susan. They have such a dispersion in the values that I am not sure we can use them at all, they simply go all over the place and there is no trend, no rule no nothing to them. The biggest thing that worries me is that there are some subsets with trends that get inverted sometimes depending on the orderin which the experiments have been conducted: makes me think about some problem with instrumental setup. Needs further investigation.  (I am trying these new features of the editor...will be back to my normal style soon -I hope-)  This afternoon we'll help Eve moving to her new house. It's a cute nice house... Ehm, I just realized that when we'll go back to Europe, a "cute nice house" with three bedrooms and four bathrooms is going to be completely out of discussion. We won't ever be able be able to allow ourselves such luxury. I guess cheap immobile property is among the few advantages USA offers. Along with finding a well paid job if U r worth it. Somebody remind me again why we want to go back to Europe?!?! Aaahh, well, I still have a long long list of why. Long long list of many small and medium things vs short short list. I guess the long long list for Europe wins anyway.&nbsp;What was I talking about anyway? Oh, helping eve move. Of course the weather has turned into stormy, grey skies and random drizzles ( urlLink Kimi  U would like this!).  I am not having good news from home. Called my mom in Italy and she was telling me that one of great-aunnts in Iran is not doing well :( My two great-aunts have been as much as grandmas to us. My resolution to go to Iran has just doubled. I have been told all these past years how much they miss us and that they really think they won't see us before they die and now I feel so bad and guilty. I owe them much more than a trip to see them. I really think I am going to tell Susan that I will take of a week or so to go to Iran. I even don't care if she will be mad at me (she will, I know it!). It just doesn't matter.  ...Have to go back to work. At least I will leet Susan know I have worked hard before taking off.  I really hate the spell check now. It just gives me suggestions without higlighting the text!

      (U should sing it like Norah Jones' " urlLink sunrise, sunrise ".) Thunderstorms: one after another. Just few minutes in between to see the sun and then again, the wind blows, the skies darken up and the rain falls, slashing its power. A bit like me lately. I am tired deep in my bones, need absolutely some good sleep, some days of nothingness and instead I drag myself the whole time around to do errands and get some work done. And the things even move on. I am not sad, just tired. I even manage to keep the smile on my face. :) I wrote that and the smile just became a bit wider...heheheh, now it stretches all across my face, up to my eyes and two rows of teeth just shine. Now I feel silly, so even give it a small laugh. Aahhhhh, the smile therapy. How long it has been since I applied it last time! Amazingly it works always! Now that I have the smile well back in place I feel already better, a bit more energy, a few more rays of sunshine. Things work and I should be happy about that ;) Yesterday right before going to the gym we checked out small vegetable garden (1m by 2!). Imagine our surprise to find ten red cherry tomatoes and two huge zucchinis plus four more normal sized ones! The biggest one was 30cm long and almost 10 cm wide. HUGE I tell U! U should have seen our faces. So like two well grown up kids that we are we run with our hands full back to the house and we took pictures of all them. As soon as I download the pics I will post one... And Tiger was growling with happiness " Oh, we are so good. Look at these, etc." We? I never even touched that stretch of ground :) "so, I point out that it is all his doing and he should be proud. "well, technically U could be right. But when I have been working here U have been preparing dinner. So afterall, it is the result of both our works!" Tiger has sometimes strange logics... One more smile and I am going back to the lab ;) You should remember to smile too! :D

BBC has  urlLink a story  on how somebody scammed the scammer ;) and here are two good reasons why U should read it: 1) it is REALLY funny. 2) it shows that some people are really dumb. 3) it also shows that some people that think they are smart, are really dumb!  Enjoy thanks to Ravi that continued to snicker while reading it, till I turned around and asked him what was up ;)

      Unbelievable but true: Gufona sat at her desk and in a burst of creative energy (right!!!) wrote the conclusions in 15 minutes and finished with the abstract update in equal time. The article is in Susan's inbox now: the ball is in her court! And I can breath...for 5minutes. I have two folders full of data to be analyzed and the thesis hasn't gone further than 5 pages. And those 5 are not fully written pages by any mean: they are the title, the page with the name of the committee members and the signature places, the acknowledgement page (title and nothing written) and stuff like that. Better than nothing anyway, right?! I still feel like this weight has been taken from my shoulders. It was beginning to make me feel like  urlLink Atlas  with the world on his shoulders. I have found out that I literally have begun to curve my shoulders and this is me, someone that was proud to walk straight. Shoulders back, chest in front, belly in and... march!  Or maybe instead of marching, I will just sit here at my desk and work on all these data.

      I am back. I tried to bite a couple of people, but didn't bite them  at the end. Mostly growled... Anyway, done a partial Xristamss shopping at the  urlLink Art Fest  (yes, we people lost in the middle of nowhere of PA, have to do our shopping all year round. Imagine, how difficult it is every year to bring back home to Italy and France something American, but still nice and classy so people over there can use them!). At least that was something positive done... Would need a few pages of writing on all my bad behavior of this weekend, but I have absolutely to finish writing the article by tomorrow. I have seriously to do lots of work, beginning NOW.

      I have been stressing myself so much lately over the things I had to do. Today, everything is out of my hands:  1) the piezo measurement setup is still not working;  2) the shadow masks are in use;  3) the probe station is reserved for a visitor researcher;  4) the new setup needs calculations from a reference that is not currently available (but Tiger has promised he is going to find it anyway for this evening and when he promises this kind of stuff he tends to keep the promise!);  5) the aging experiment need the probe station which is in use anyway;  So I am sitting here in this gloomy grey day with dooming air wondering what can I do? I could be gone shopping (I haven't still found anything for my dad, my grandma and the greataunts, one of the uncles,...and I still hope to find something a bit nicer for my sisters).  Shall I write? Shall I read? I can't quite concentrate still...but I should.  I can go directly to get my renewed I-9 and stop by the library...hmmm. Now that could be a good idea.  If U are wondering why I have to write down all my mind's stupid rammblings here, well, I don't have a good answer to that :)

      I am beginning to really get out of control. Jumpy with every single thing, I am on the verge of a complete break down.  I am walking, not even so slowly, on the sharp edge of a blade and my flesh is scored by dozens of cuts (no  urlLink Negar, not like your friend !). My heart is beating at the rhythm of thousand drums, emotions are&nbsp;boiling in me and it seems I am never able to let go of them. Not enough at least.  My muscles are tensed, my brain is hazed and every single fiber in my body cries to be pushed further and faster: and me, I go through moments when I dare and push and when I am scared and hold back.  A cry seems to be forever stuck in my throat. I know I am on the verge of&nbsp;falling or exploding or simply shattering into pieces.

      ...analyzing data the whole morning. The original idea was to get data and analyze them during the trip to Iran, but this morning I realized we never installed the pressure gauge on the new high pressure chamber. What's the use of a high pressure chamber if U don't know how high is the pressure?! Chris was just really nice and right before lunch he brought back the machined piece to me: this one was too difficult for me do it myself! which reminds me of the fact that I have been doing enough sawing, drilling, gluing, screwing pieces together and things like that that I can even begin a career as a carpenter.  So in w while I will take my stuff and move to the lab to begin to do some measurements. Hopefully!  ...(3 minutes later)...  the hole Chris has made, for some reason, doesn't let the pressure gauge to be screwed in completely. I talked too early! :P  Maybe it can still gauge it anyway. I really have to go try it out now.  &nbsp;  (personal consideration: I am really sure I wantde to write about something else here and not&nbsp; pressure gauges!)

      Bunch of things to say, but in really really short time, so here it is:  1) I will be going to Iran afterall this summer. I wish it had been in a better situation, but hey, we don't decide everything in our lives. 12days barely: leaving on August1st and coming back on 14th. Losing at least two days in flights. Kimi, I really hope to see U however it goes ;)  2) went to williamsport for Max's birthday and finally after many motnhs, relaxed completely and didn't think about all the worries I had, just in time to come back yesterday and be told about all the things that are broken in the lab. Hallelujah to the Almighty: gives back with open arms and open heart. Unfortunately it comes as often in form of&nbsp;bad news as good news. But  I guess He is doing the best he can too.  3) Helped Even moving in Friday and we were done moving her stuff already by Friday evening :) she will just need to take a whole week off to re-arrange everything and clean a bit. But she can not, so she's trying to get everything done in the evenings after she comes back from work.  4) Finally talked to Ioanna on the phone after ages. I miss her sooo much. So many times, the frustration had to be taken out by leaving the lab with a friend to go take a coffee, indulge in a lusciously decadent dessert and spend money shopping while chatting the whole time (read "bitching" on the whole world! Pardon the language!)...yes, sounds extremely superficial, but it was really therapeutic! She will come back for a month here. arriving the same day as me and actually we will drive, just the two of us, to Montreal by our own. That would make the 8 hour trip more pleasant :) ane we definitely will enjoy the C urlLink onference  more. Oh, and she got a job offer in Denmark but she is still pondering it...  5) I had much more to say, but right now it seems I have forgotten eveything...  6) the "spell checking" thing still doesn't work: U will continue to find more errors in my writing till they fix that feature. I never go back to actually read what I write so, beware when YOU read.

        First of all, it's nice to know so many people share your love for the same author :)&nbsp; Thank all of you who left a note on the  urlLink Behrangi post . And it seems that it wasn't only me who had to read the book with a missing cover ;)  Today is going to be the last day of regular posting: I am leaving tomorrow for Iran. Gee, it is going to be probably one of the longest trips I have ever done: we will drive to NY in the morning and then I will fly out of JFK some time before midnight, will arrive tomorrow at 8 something pm local time in Dubai and then again sometime after/around midnight will fly to Tehran. If I&nbsp;think about it I leave on July 31st and arrive on August 2nd, which is kind of crazy... Or maybe it sounds like that only to me, because it's the first time I fly for the States to Iran and back. Usually Europe was more than enough for me ;)  I will take the laptop with me, so I will probably will be able to keep up taking notes about my observation and U bet many of those will end up here when I will be to get an internet connection. I already warn U that I am a bit sarcastic in my comments on fellow Iranians that show off at every corner specially when traveling, so beware...  I am also taking the digital camera, so maybe U will get even a few photos...  At the end, if U r not interested in my trip to Iran, well, U can either avoid coming here for a good while, or continue to check out this place in two weeks when I'll be back and will be hastily and stressfully preparing my talk and poster for the  urlLink IEEE conference  :)  I am already crossing my fingers: I am&nbsp;turning more and more nervous.

      I found t urlLink his Blog  that has a comprehensive (or at least one of the ones to come very close to be so) of Samad Behrangi's works.  I have grown up reading again and again his stories. We have read so many times his Olduz series that the whole book had to be kept in a binder so we wouldn't lose pages.  I remember the excitement to be able to go to "Mahi Siah Kuchulu" kindergarten (although for only two weeks), because of its name and the fact that they had that beautiful logo everywhere, specially right on the front door.  How many talents lost before, during and after shah in Iran for politics.  Samad Behrangi: ruhash shaad.

      sticky foggy day it is. Thanks god at least the AC is working fine in the lab and office ;) I am here at work with a sense of purposefulness around me and notice I say around me and not inside me. Paul yesterday adjusted the setup instead of Chris so I can decide if I wan to do the measurements for Susan and the people for UMD before leaving for Iran or not. That was really nice of he. I mean he has these mood swings sometimes, but most of the time he is really nice and helpful. So today I actually HAVE something I can do. I can begin to do the measurements. I have even scheduled in the afternoon to show around our labs' this guy from Intel. Something to do: it was all I needed (please don't&nbsp;remember that I said this,&nbsp;next time I mention anything&nbsp;like "I wish I had nothing to do"!). So once again I took the time today to be "fashionably correct" which is just by comparison to the general standards in this lab. Gee,&nbsp;you would never see a 26 year old in Italy still in jeans, even if in matching colors head to toe. I definitely have begin to be much more sloppy in dressing since I have been leaving in the States. My sense of fashion, color palettes, matching accessories and stuff like that still exist though very more dormant in the classic side that really going with the hits and hots of the season - which is not a bad thing as it can be considered personal style, but at the same time, as soon as I go back home to Italy, I kind of begin to feel a bit the "weird one". Ok, here I am the weird one (not at the levels of Ioanna, but still) because I still dress up respect to the general standards, there I am the weird one because I dress low key respect to the general standards. I almost fell head over heals last Christmas went I went back home. I was just sitting there sipping my cappuccino with mom, when Roshy&nbsp;comes back from Padova and her classes. Ok, so she is studying LAW, so they&nbsp;are definitely in a different world respect to any engineering school or laboratory facility, but still to see this gorgeous girl with curly long black hair, a sweeping long grey&nbsp;palteau,&nbsp;black high-heeled boots, pin strip&nbsp;dark grey pants,&nbsp;a shifting grey/black pashmina on the top of all and dressy bag at the side,&nbsp;cat-walking&nbsp;toward me, was an experience I can not easily forget! Me, sitting there in my Gap jeans, my black short boots (even though in leather, I more guess made in China and not definitely an Italian brand) and a 24-hours-trip-worn-out black knit.  By the end of each trip, I remind myself that taking care of myself and dressing well is not synonymous of superficial and I promise myself that I will just do that even over here, even if nobody else cares about it.  And every time, after a month I have already been slacking!  And I was thinking how amusing it is that in Iran I care definitely less thatn anywhere else, how do I dress. But I think that is kind of genetic. Although my mom has a nice sense of style, I remember that every time my grandma had a big "dinner party", she would call us when we were all getting ready and say "please ask you mom not to put again her yellow dress! My friends would think she has only that one!"...  I guess I got from my mom much more than the bone structure, the eyes or being an engineer ;)

If U don't see the comment link at the bottom left corner of each post (after the signature and time), please send me at  gufona[at]gmail[dot]com.   Thank you all ;)

      has been pretty damn ugly these last two-three weeks. Though Kimi would love it a lot: it continues to rain and if it doesn't rain, it stays pretty humid and the air smells like rain is coming soon. It has become also considerably colder: I a lmnost feel as if it was the beginning of fall in Iran. As for that, even the well advanced fall here.   I want the summer back!!!!!    Anyway, almost everything is ready for my trip, well, except making the luggage. So I have bought a present for almost everyone (I think...let me check...yes, I think I have taken something for everyone!). Considering that every time I travel, I have the unfortunate chance of getting my luggage 3-6 days after my arrival, I am leaving with only one cabin trolley and a backpack for my laptop. I am not really cure I will have enough space for putting in my stuff, but after all, I am not staying long enough to need so many things. A couple of pants, a few T-shirts,&nbsp; a dress and therefore a pair of dressy shoes... Isn't that it?! Oh, and how could I forget? The scarf and overcoat!!!! (I talked on the phone with my mom on Saturday before they leaved for Tehran too and her first words to me right after "salam" were: "rupush&nbsp; rusari yadet nareh" or "don't forget the scarf and overcoat").  Now I am nervous for the trip. Can U believe it? Worried, nervous and excited.&nbsp;Of course there is my aunt, but then there&nbsp;is also the fact that I haven't been to Tehran for at least 5-6 years now. Everytime I go back is a bit the same: I feel home. That's the first thought. And then all in a rush, I see all the changes and invariably I become sad after a while. They say that they know that we don't leave in Iran by just looking at us: and it is not just because we have the so un-fashionable overcoats and scarves (who cares if this year it is pastel or bright colors, or it's tight and up or old-empire or whatever!). It's not even only because we don't have that heavy make-up that everyone seems to have embraced there. It's not even the fact that we haven't have plastic surgeries, tattooed eyebrows, liplines or whatever. It's the feeling that we are happy inside. It's the way we walk, we talk (in part the continuous moving of the hands: after all living in Italy has many "side-effects") and we interact with people.  Maybe it is not only the fact that we have been living out of Iran for so long: it's just the way our parents have brought us up with&nbsp;"respect everyone". Smile and be nice to people, even if they seem angry and&nbsp;disrespectful. A smile can make wonders, a few nice words make seeming&nbsp;miracles.  So many times it has happened that I have been with my parents somewhere and angry clerks have turned up to be only tired, sad people that have just lost control by dealing with more tired, sad, troubled&nbsp;people. I also admit that it does happen that there jerks too, but many times that nice smile, a couple of jokes, making people feel at ease and not being snobs had done&nbsp;much more that the yelling and shouting of many others and the "I know somebody that knows somebody that...".  Well, now I feel even a bit the nostalgia...  A deep breath, a deeper sigh and I am back to real life. Another week and I'll be home.
