       Good Evening Chickys!   And How Are We All?   Good...   Well... It's Definatly Been An Interesting Day Today! I Started Out Waking Up, And Taking Off My Bed Sheets. Lol. Great Eh? The I Tidied, And So On... Midday I Thought "I'm Bored... Let's See What James Is Up To..." So He Rung Me Up, Then Came Round. He'd Been There 5 Minutes When Mummy Dear Decides That She's Going To Shout At Me! So I Storm Out, James At My Heels... Heading&nbsp;Down The Track, We Get Near Town So I Sat Down, Saying I Wanted To Kill Myself, And Attempting To Do So. I Was Being Stubborn, Then Esam Comes, And They Both Try And Get Me To Move So I'm Kicking And Lashing&nbsp;Out...   Then I Decided I Was Going To Go Into Town With Esam.. I Found Out Somethig That Will Haunt Me For The&nbsp;Rest Of My Life... *shivers*&nbsp;Anyway... We Get Into Town And We Are Talking,&nbsp;And I Randomly Reply To Something Esam Said With "Sexy!" So, This Old Lady Walking By Said "Shut Your Gob!" Well Me And Esam Were So Shocked... After This We WEnt Shopping Then Headed Back. I Went To Go See Jane-Annabell At Her Gymnastics, Where Me And Mum Talked... We Are Now Friends... The Eye Appointment Was Weird Though... She Shone A Bright Light Into My Eyes And Asked Me To Open Them Wider! I Was Like "No Fucking Way!" Heading Out To The Car, It Rains, I Was Soaking Wet! Now I'm Writing This Pile Of Crap... So... I'm Nakerd!!!   Buh Biz Chickys xx
