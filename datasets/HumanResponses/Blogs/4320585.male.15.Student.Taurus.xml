         Rant Number 2 Second day of school Oy, now we start actual keyboarding…what great joy! **coughcough** I really suck at normal keyboarding…It definitely isn’t one of my strong points. I type my own way really. Its sorta mixed up proper typing with index finger typing. You know, where you only use your index fingers to press down every single letter? Haha that’s how I used to type when I didn’t know how to. Well this is really boring… These keyboarding books look cool tho… they are more like notepads for learning how to keyboard correctly. AHHHH this is messing up my normal typing, learning this gay new way of typing…bleah this sucks. I remember learning this in sixth grade with Mr. Donovan… he was nice, but the class sucked. **15 minutes later** OMG I’m going to kill myself because this is so much different from my normal style of typing that its driving me crazy! I suck at the normal style of typing! All we are doing is a sad dad; all lads fall; asl a lass; a jak salad; BLARGH! WHO FREAKING CARES ABOUT A SAD DAD OR A JAK SALAD! WTF IS A JAK SALAD?! I don’t know but its retarded just like these books… I really need to either go outside or get some help. Mental help. :P I can’t wait till lunch, cause I have a yummy sandwich (yummy!) and THE SCHOOL’S COOKIES! Omg those cookies are teh best! THEY R0X325 my 50( 1337 ARE TEH BEST! These cookies are sooooo good. Chocolatey chippy cookies! Yummzors! I think I’m going crazy. Nevermind I AM crazy. I like monkeys. That was random. Haha memories from literature yesterday… "This is Michael Miller my partner, he lives in Randolph in the middle of nowhere, he has 40 pets not including his 49 toads as his pond (yes he counted), he likes to feed house spiders, he used to catch snakes, and he likes to put things into sockets and make them explode!" XD that was hilarious! "This is Nate, he weighs 268 pound, is 6’10’’, and is a beast, an-" "Thank you. Nate, congrats on making a bad impression of yourself on the first day. Your permanent assigned seat will be over there." Hahahaha that was so funny! Well its about time for me to head cause computer class is over… See you all in the asylum!  (haha j/k)
