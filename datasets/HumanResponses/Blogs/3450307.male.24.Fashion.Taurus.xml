      Well, this evening was a strange adventure.  Through the poison-laced web of my mother's mind came a whisper of an idea that she should have dinner with me this week.  She called on Tuesday saying my father wanted to see me and have dinner but that he wasn't there at the moment.  I told her to tell him to call me when he was back so we could make an arrangement.  She said fine.  I got a call on Wednesday night from her saying they wanted to see me Friday.  I said perhaps, but that Thursday was better.  I mentioned that we should do an early dinner, and she said that was great.    Today, I called before I left work (5:30) to see what the status of things was.  Apparently my father was on business and wouldn't be able to leave before 6, which was fine.  An early dinner by 6:30 or 7 doesn't hurt at all.  Thus, I left work and went home expecting to hear from my parents at some point, informing me of their departure from home headed in my general direction.    At 9:00pm I still hadn't heard anything from my parents (I napped from 6:30... to prepare for the parental onslaught).  I called them to see what was the matter.  They said they were just leaving and they'd call me when they were near.  Fine, I say.  Starving.    At around 9:30 my mother phones from her mobile telling me that they are almost there, and I ask where we're going to dinner and if I should dress better-than-casual.  She nonchalantly mentions that they've had dinner already and that we were just going out for dessert and coffee...      Excuse me??     I waited for 4 hours, (not to mention that I'd had a particularly light lunch today) for coffee and dessert?!  I sputtered audibly on the phone, and just said "OK" and hung up.  My mother, font of charity that she is, showed up at my apartment door with a garbage bag - a garbage bag, in all its sagging, plastic glory - of "food" for my dinner.  Now, I'm not sure if it was the presentation (she was holding it out to me in that "ick" manner, as if the contents were precisely what any onlooker would expect a container of that sort to house) or the fact that upon opening the bag, I was greeted with two apples and four granola bars, that caused the vein in my left lobe to rupture.  But rupture it did, and with it my poise - my expression soured and I walked past her into the street voicelessly.    She asked if anything was the matter but I was determined not to make a point out of it.  However, she was.  She prodded and picked and pulled just like the mechanical harvester which made those lovely granola bars possible - and I, like the grain, yielded, then gave.    Yet after thirty minutes of calm conversation, she couldn't seem to grasp that there would be any reason to be annoyed.  So I became irate, just to help color the picture better.  I explained (again) that I'd been waiting four hours for them, and they didn't so much as give me the courtesy of a one minute phone call to tell me that they were going to, were in the process of, or had already, eaten dinner, yet waited until they were ten minutes away to tell me that I was to be having no dinner and only coffee and dessert.    Outrageous.  I'm one to talk though.  I dropped it as soon as I realized there was no point in chasing it.  My parents will never be on time. My parents will never "understand" me. My parents will never grant me common courtesies, because that would be "bending," and one doesn't bend for their children.  Other points to come soon.  Moving on- we went to an old haunt of my father's from his NYU days, but he was disappointed to see that it was under new ownership and wasn't as he remembered it.  What ensued was a very interesting tour of the general West Village area around MacDougal Street and the surrounding blocks, led by my dad and highlighting where the popular hangouts were, who worked where, what store was operated by what people and what the area looked like.  It was very very engrossing and I quickly forgot that it was in fact almost midnight.  Overall, good times, thanks to dad.

      I have to say that I've been a bit less than wonderful at being on time to the office lately; it's been a combination of late nights spent not testing the limits of fun-having but instead braving the depths of late-night-food-eating coupled with hotter-than-hell temperatures and sweat-from-your-shins humidity.  Unpleasant.    Thus I went to bed last night without a dinner (which I've been eating, on average, around 11-12 lately) and with miraculously sleep-inducing weather (cool and breezy; everyone knows your body sleeps better in cooler temperatures).  I slept like a fat, French bond trader with his feet up at his desk at 2pm.  (very, very well.)  I woke up early this morning, refreshed, rested, and a little chilled, but comfortable.  I got into the shower early, which was great, until the hot water magically disappeared.  That was immediately followed by my shampoo being finished, my conditioner bursting everywhere, the water *still* being freezing, jumping out of the shower only to have a horrible morning shave, and getting to my closet in time to realize I was *late*.  As I shut the door to my room it grazed my achilles and tore off a small continent of flesh, right where my soon-to-be-worn shoes would rub for the rest of the day.  The train stopped for a full five minutes at every stop because of a broken door, there were bums in every car, and one fabulously headstrong black woman who was built like Buster Douglas didn't like the idea of other people being the first ones out of the train when we got to Rockefeller Center.  There are plenty of other things I could mention but for all intensive purposes, the question remains, "Why do I bother?"  I could have easily just gotten up at my normal time and most likely arrived at work at the same time with less stress and less pain and suffering.  It's like one of those strange days where you feel like nothing is under your control and that some group of wraiths has conspired to pull on your strings and make you dance the funnydance, just to make you lose it.  jeesh.  I'm not making any sense.  Back to work!

      A fleeting thought... dress codes at work.  Why?  Yes, fine, look professional.  Wouldn't a uniform be better though?  Doesn't that say more about adherence to company policy and devotion to one's workplace than simply wearing a suit and tie?  Wouldn't that provide more of a unified front feeling to both people inside and outside the company?  It promotes fraternity amongst employees because let's face it: people are quick to see differences.  I may be wearing nice slacks and a nice shirt but next to your $3,000 Canali suit I look damn shitty, thanks.  Do I feel like you're my boss because of what you wear?  Not really, I rather think you're an idiot because notwithstanding that you have a great suit on, you can't seem to comb your hair.  Ever.  But do I feel like you're my boss because of your knowledge and experience?  Yes.  And would I feel that you were more approachable if I felt that you were on my level somehow?  Yes.    Of course, there are far too many people who simply adhere to the *concept* of looking professional without actually putting any human thought into what they look like.  Slacks and a buttondown with a tie can be so grossly misinterpreted, clowns would be embarassed.  Just because it *is* a shirt, and they *are* slacks, and it *is* a tie, doesn't mean they should be worn in attempted coordination.  Chaos is only beautiful in mathematical theory, not in fashion, thanks.  Hotshot young broker/designer/banker/publisher fools should also note that clothes come in other flavors besides Banana Repugnant.  Please learn to dress, and in doing so, learn to shop.  There are colors out there, and textures, and other materials besides stretch-everything.  Christ.    Note to Frenchmen everywhere: suits are *not* sweatpants.  Please wear them with a *belt* and perhaps, if you can find that famed-but-not-oft-seen "class" that you are somehow God-given and genetically endowed with, please tuck in your shirt, just so I don't feel strange for being the only one who does it...  much appreciated.

      So this is it, I've made that step into the world of reality internet where people who have nothing better to do sit around and read about your life while they get high on their Sanford® King Size™ markers.  I'm not necessarily doing this to catch up with the world as much as I'm doing it for the world to catch up with me.  Unfortunately if you're trying to catch up with pre-today events, you're screwed.  Maybe I'll set up a time line fo'yo ign'ant asses.  Whatever.

      I recently reinstalled my air conditioner, an exercise in pure functionality.  ie. mostly the dysfunctionality of my room when the A/C was sitting on the floor and robbing me of almost 4 square feet of space (that's a king's ransom in this city).  While I am sad to lose a good portion of my view onto the world, as well as my access to my porch (read: fire escape), I am happy because I can now relocate my hamper *behind* my bicycle and free up some floor space.  The bugger A/C wasn't bad to lift off the floor and install or anything, and I was greeted by all make and manner of dust, grit, grime, and filth which had been communing underneath.  Once I got past these little commonwealths, I entered upon the almost forgotten trove of CDs which had been slowly making their way further and further into history and out of my memory in the months I couldn't gain access to them.  It was, for lack of a better phrasiology, like Kwanzaa in August.  Or Christmas in April.  Or whatever.  Today, I will be raiding more of these CDs.  Either before or after my jaunt to the marshy, broken up land of Breuckelen (and hopefully to the sovereign of said land, Lord Peter Luger).    Pete of Texas is supposed to be in town tonight but I don't think I'm going to be able to see him, being that it's just the start of the workweek and he'll undoubtedly want some party-time into the night.  We shall see.
