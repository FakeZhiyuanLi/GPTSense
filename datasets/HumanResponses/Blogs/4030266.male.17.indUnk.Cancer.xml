      Silly dreams... Pas gua ketiduran di meja, my mind subconciously think of certain things that have been burried in my mind for several years. I remembered the time when I was back in Singapore, thinking of what my actual purpose of life was. And here again, in another country, a new environment that I start to reflect upon certain things. Just when my mood was at the peak of my happy mountain, things have to turn 180 degrees to destroy my joy and happiness. Why do I exist in the first place? I thought. What is it that I'm living for? Is the thing/ person I'm living for worth my suffering here on Earth? I turn to God again. Maybe he's the reason I live.... Wait a minute... The fact that I live is because he wants me to live... Entertain him maybe? Follow his words? I feel that I have a greater calling to attend to... I miss those days when I could take care of the Old Folk's or the Children in the child care centre. Is it for their sake that I'm willing to do this? Or is it because of my yearns for a sense of superiority, importance and for a sense of security... Before that, I've never thought of myself as important... or even helpful to anyone... I separated myself from this world... My friends... who are they? Just another person who walks through my life.... And so I thought... but I've come to realise that some ppl leave footsteps in your heart... Just like wat Melvina always say... I have a great family... I really do... I love all of them and I'm sure they love me... Just did not take the time to realise how precious they are in my heart.. My precious sister... one who always quarrel with me..., and one that I can show my true self to... (Jayus and jijai) My beautiful and caring mom... I've never meant to break your heart... Sometimes I could'nt help but do things to hurt those that I love... Ignorance costs a lot... And my strict but righteous dad... who taught me important lessons in life... Survival, endurance and discipline... Never thought I'd grow so much through these years... I just hope I'll figure myself out and straighten my thoughts... know wat I want to do in life before I hit my twenties and just go for it...

      ...... Life hasn't been so good lately. Too many troubles brewing on my mind. Guess life is like a wheel huh... Just created this blog to make me feel better. Well... it works hahaahaha... See my problems >>> Package not delivered, English Essay to write, math hw to do, math exam to study... ARGH...!!! Frustrated man... I've been having these weird dreams lately too. Me swimming underwater, another one where there's this snake that is protecting me from a man but even though it tried to protect me, I tried to kill it... WEIRD~ hmm... Been feeling really down lately.... I dunno why -_-"" Hmm.. guess I'll do a recap on what happened yesterday. Basically, I woke up at 2 p.m. ^^ Went home late the other night... at 3 am I think.... Played basketball, soccer, kickball.... Woke up with a sore body... hahahaa... decided to sleep again :P Hmm... dunno why but I wanted to go to church yesterday. Went to church and the first thing I did was kneel in front of Mother Mary and shared with her all my troubles. When I'm done, I noticed smthg... I was actually crying... for no reason at all... Felt better though... My first cry this year... After church, we went to grab dinner at Joo Joo in Hana market... Didn't really eat... No appetite... Saw Daranee with her three friends and I was like .... WOw hahahaa... Then another familiar face appeared... Mbeekkkk.... hahahaha... surprisingly Dolly and friends were there too... Couldn't notice the rest though... Went home, did my laundry and then slept... Boring huh??!! -_-"" I thought so too... Neways gotta do my hw now... Wish me all the best and pray for me k... THX hahha...

      Wah gile... udah August man... Can't believe I've spent 2 months in States... Semakin lama semakin cepet aja... Tahun ini gak kerasa banget... It's too fast to be true... Apa cuman gua yg merasa begini? Kayanya baru satu bulan gitu eh... tiba tiba udah August... I can still remember the first day of school in ACJC.. hahhaha... bener deh... things just happens too fast.. Maybe I'm too occupied with work -_-"" gotta take time to reflect and collate my thoughts... Hmmm... cuman rasanya aneh banget man... selama gua di States gua udah jarang mikirin keluarga gua lagi disono :( bahaya nih... drifting further and further apart.. gak kaya waktu gua di sg... hahaha.. masih kangen ama Mom and Dad... well I dunno man.. is this what they say when there would be a time when a man would leave their parents? Maybe... well I still think I'm immature at times... hahahaha... gotta grow up fast.. learn how to take care of myself... Well guess that's all I have to say for today... hahaha.. finals coming... Gotta get perfect A's for both subject... kalo gak bisa BT gua... ^^ too ambitious? Of course not.. I know my limits and my capabilities... I'm sure that A is mine... Hmm.. I can almost taste it right now... hahaha... the sweetness of victory... ;) Well my goals are the things that keeps me going... Kayanya tanpa goals, my life would be worthless... hmm... guess I gotta find a greater goal then ;) hehehe... Jya ne!~ Wish me luck for my exams k... thanks...
