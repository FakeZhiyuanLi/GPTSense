						   It's getting close to the end of the month and close to my first weigh-in. I am really looking forward to it for the most part. I feel like when I go I will have a pretty substantial loss, but a part of me is scared that I won't. I guess as long as I don't see a gain it will be good though, I don't anticipate a gain though. I have been more active this month then I have the entire 7 months since we moved. I can't even believe that it's been 7 months since we moved... it seems like it was a few weeks!  When I walk with my " urlLink Walk Away The Pounds " tapes I can do 2 miles before I feel really tired. Last night I went to the fitness center at my apartment complex and I only did 1 mile before I got tired. I mean why was doing 1 mile on the tread mill so much harder then 2 miles of the tape? Also when I walk outside I get tired way sooner then doing anything... I just don't get it. I realize that walking outside is harder because it's not always level, but I plan on doing more of it this summer. Matt and I are going to the park 3 days this week as long as it doesn't rain. I want to go Friday, Saturday and Sunday because it's supposed to be in the upper 60's.   Last night I had a dream about getting married. Matt and I were at some "market" that his parents both had booths in and we went to tell them about how we got engaged and then married. I even saw the ring in my dream, it wasn't the ring I want in real life but I loved it. I think I dreamed about it because at work yesterday a friend and I were discussing weddings. I told her how I don't want to tell anyone we are getting married and just want to surprise everyone. My dream wedding is to have everyone over for a "party" then spring the wedding on them. I think it sounds like a ton of fun!   My mom brought up the subject of marriage today on the phone. I think she is getting anxious for us to finally take that step. If we hadn't had so much trouble this year at tax time we had planned to get engaged. Now I'm not sure when we will be doing it, I hope it's soon though. I have never met another person that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with like I do with Matt. Even at our worst times I can't imagine another person I could ever want to be with. I love him so much! Lucky me!!   403.2#

						   I just got done doing my workout for the day and I am feeling good. It's strange but I always dread my daily workout but during it and after I always feel so great. It's a good motivation I guess to really push myself to do it. On the other hand, there are days where I just can't wait to do my workouts. I read once that it takes 6 months to break old habits and form new ones. I look forward to the day that always look forward to my workouts.   I am becoming a bigger and bigger fan of Leslie Sansone and the " urlLink Walk Away The Pounds " tapes. She is really so energetic and she really makes walking so enjoyable. I highly recommend them to anyone who is trying to lose weight or just trying to get some type of exercise done. Right now I have 5 of her tapes but I want to buy more. I am considering buying myself 1 every time I get paid (every two weeks) so it won't dent my budget too much.   Today has been a lazy one, with the exception of exercising I haven't done a single thing all day. I take that back, I did do the dishes and I also finished a book. It is snowing again and with Matt working tonight I haven't done anything else. I'm glad though because I really needed a night off. Work has just really been stressing me out lately and I'm not exactly sure why. I think the over-nights are just really stressing me. I would really like to get to a "normal" schedule so the my sleep and eating patterns can get sorted out.   Oh well, I'm about to start gabbing with Kim so I'm outta here!   403.2#

						   If I could change one thing about myself what would it be? I have been asked this question a lot, too many times really. In reality though it's something I have often thought about and I always come up with the same answer. That should make this "transformation" easier don't you think?   When I was very young something inside of me changed. I went from being a normal everyday kid, to a normal everyday overweight kid. It seemed like it happened overnight, ask anyone. I was always "big boned" but it seemed like out of nowhere I went from big boned to "chubby". Chubby soon turned into something more and before I knew it my life was spinning out of control.   I could bore you with the rest of the details but I'm sure you have heard it a million times. The fat kid grows up to be an even fatter adult. I have been on dozens of "diets" that never seemed to work. Don't get me wrong some of them worked for a short time, but something always happened to bring that to an end. I don't just hope that this time is different, I KNOW it will be!   Let's get this party started!   403.2#

						   There are a few things that I can't wait to do once I lose the weight. Some of them are rather petty and small, but are all things I have often thought about. No matter what they may seem though I still want them, badly. I long for the changes that I know will come with losing weight, things that some people take for granted. Sometimes it would be nice to live a "normal" life. I want to do the things that so many take for granted like walking up stairs and breathing normally. I want to fit into any chair I sit in and not have to worry about fitting in booths at restaurants. I want to be able to walk without my knees, ankles and feet killing me. I want to really live and no longer be ashamed of who I am and what I look like.   I am looking forward to wearing clothes that are small and pretty. Lets face facts here... plus sized clothes are just not that attractive. Clothing designers for the plus sized market don't make clothes that are youthful. When your the size I am now it's hard to find things that aren't geared toward older or professional women. Stretch pants and t-shirts are my entire wardrobe and I am sick of them! I can't wait to shop at places like the " urlLink The Gap " and " urlLink Old Navy " which I have never been able to do. I want to buy matching bra and panty sets that don't cost $60 (like the plus-size).  I also want to see people from my past and show off the new me. Most have only ever known me as fat, and I would love to see their reaction to the new me. There is one man in particular that I used to be interested in. When I met him I was still under 300 pounds but slowly creeping up higher and higher. By the time our friendship ended I was at about 335... I have since gained more obviously. When we met he thought I was too big and should lose some weight. I only went on to gain... but I can't wait for the day when I am below 200. I want to see him, with me being in a great relationship and thinner then I have ever been and show him just what he missed out on by focussing solely on my weight.   I want to start my journey to motherhood. I want to be able to get pregnant, because at the size I am now it's not happening. I want to have a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby. I want to enjoy my children growing up, and I want to be able to play with them without being too tired or too sore. I want to run and jump and enjoy them as much as I possibly can. I want to be able to set a good example and each my kids better eating habits then what I grew up with, I can hardly wait!   Like I said... some things are petty and some are not, but one day I will live them all.   385.12#

						   Life is good. I have had the best week ever this week. I was able to stay OP (On Plan/On Program) the entire week and it feels good. I was able to stay with my fitness goals and my eating was really good. Next week will be even better, I can feel it! I have been worried about my upcoming week of over-nights at work, but I think things will work out for the best. Normally the over-nights really interrupt my eating patterns and leave me feeling hungry too often, this week I will just have to be more focussed. Hopefully this week will go good though and I can stay in control.    That being said... I want to write about my newest set of goals. I have decided that I want to do 15 pound "mini" goals. It's going to be hard with me only weighing myself once a month but thats not something I want to change. I don't want to be one of those people who spend all of their time obsessed over what the scale says. Not only will I be working on my 15 pound "mini" goals but I have also set a long term goal for myself that does not include weight. I have decided that if I can stay OP until January 1, 2005 I will reward myself with a  urlLink "Gazelle Power Plus" . I will use my tax money that I get next year and get myself something that I not only want, but that will help me with my weight loss even more. I am really looking forward to not only completing the goal but also seeing where I will be in January... almost an entire year after starting this change to my life.   Good times.   385.12#

						   Saturday was the big day. I have been looking forward to this weigh-in forever it seems, 1 month sure has gone by fast! Matt has been so supportive of me this past month it's unbelievable. I am looking forward to next month already! I guess that one month at a time makes it seem almost bearable. When your my size, the best way to lose weight is to make these "mini" goals for yourself. For me being able to say that I am another month in and that much healthier is totally worth it!   I have a confession to make though. When I went to weigh-in I was really scared. As much as I was and had been looking forward to it there was a big part of me that was worried. I was hoping to get down below my last starting point but deep down inside I was scared that wouldn't happen. While I was trying to make myself excited about seeing any loss there was that other part of me that would not be happy with the results if I didn't get to the number in my head. Thank the lord though, I actually got not just to that number but below it!   I am already set to see NEXT month's results! I have begun to prolong my workouts, and had added a lot of extra's. This month I have set a goal to 5 Days week = Walk 2 miles a day + Weights 10 minutes a day + Abs 10 minutes a day. I think that this is not only possible but it will happen! I am excited to see how this boosted up routine effects my weight loss. Hopefully I will see another loss like the one I had this month. I am 4 days into this new routine and it's starting out pretty dang good. I have also found this little "blinkie" that I just love, it fit's me so well...    Well I guess I have dragged this suspense on long enough... In the past 1 month I have lost *drumroll*  17.6 pounds!  Go me! It's my birthday! Gonna party like it's my birthday! WEEEEE!!!!  385.12#

						   I am so frustrated!! Last night at work I was wearing my sandals, they have a mere 1.5 inch platform on them. Well I had gone to the bathroom and was walking back to my desk and the heal of the shoe slid and I fell. I hurt my ankle... I'm not sure if i sprained it or just bruised the muscle so I will have to wait and see. I have sprained this ankle two other times in the past five years. I am going to have Matt look for my air-splint which is in storage, because it's sore. I am able to walk some but now I am at a loss as to what to do for exercise. I know that there is no way I can walk like I normally do at least for the next day or so. Thank goodness I have a job that doesn't require a lot of walking.   This whole situation is really upsetting to me. I was really looking forward to really getting into my exercise the rest of this month and now it's been ground to a halt. I will definitely still do some sort of exercise but I'm not sure what yet. I am almost positive that I will not be able to bike either and that really stinks. I figure I will spend this time focusing on weight lifting, leg lifts,  & abs while I can't walk. My eating is going good so I hope that this doesn't effect me too much. I just hope that I heal quickly! Life has it's ups and downs and I'm just about out of downs this month.   372.12#

						   About a year ago I found a wonderful weight loss support board.  urlLink Getting2Goal  is filled with beautiful people who have become a huge part of my life. Together we are winning this lifelong battle with weight. I have met so many people who are changing their lives for the better. We are a huge group of losers and I couldn't be prouder. That being said I have finally decided to share my journal with a few friends. Just and FYI for those people... my journal is NOT posted to on a daily basis. I hope that it will become more active with time, but for now keep checking back for updates!   This week was pretty much a complete and utter wash. I was not completely on plan, my eating was good, but I only exercised 2 out of 5 days that I had planned. I was lying to myself and my friends. I was hoping that I could get back on track but it didn't work out that way. I am so angry at myself not only for going off plan but for lying. I wasn't hurting anyone with my lies but myself and I sure wasn't fooling me. I am going to have to work on being more honest with myself. I was so excited about being on a "streak" that I was trying to maintain it without the work.   This past week I had my first mid-month weigh in and it went surprisingly well. I lost a few pounds and considering my lack of exercise this week I am pretty happy with it. Next week I am going to try harder to staying on track with my exercise. I have already planned out my menu's for next week, I used to always do that and I think it's something lacking in my program. I think that by having the established, but varied menu set up for the week I will have an easier time staying within my guidelines. This is definitely a learning experience but all that learning will only make me stronger.  372.12#

						   I had my weigh-in this past Tuesday and I was disappointed to say the least. I only had an 8 pound 13 ounce loss this month. I know though what I did different and what I need to change to improve my loss for next month. I am proud of myself though for doing as well as I did but at the same time I was very upset. Matt and I went to weigh and as soon as I saw the number I felt like bawling, which I did later after we left the mall. I was expecting so much more from myself and it was a real let down. I have lost a total of 26.1 pounds though in two months and that feels great! Having my first "bad" weigh-in I think I have decided to start weighing 2 times a month... on the 15th and the 1st. I want to have it to keep an eye on myself a tiny bit better so I know how I am doing. I don't plan on recording the mid-month loss at all I just want to have it so "I" know.  I have kicked my workouts up a notch this week and I am hoping to do more this month then last. I think that last month I really wasn't living up to my potential with my exercise... too much bike and not enough walking. I don't know why but I guess my lack of time on the bike (2 miles goes quicker there) was leaving something lacking. Starting to do a little of both this month everyday and WHEW I am feeling the difference already and I like it! I know that I have the strength to do this but I never want to take the time. I have to decide though what is more important to me, watching t.v. and playing online or getting healthy. I have been putting my body and health in second place for too long and it's definitely time for a change. I have so much support from my friends, family and God, I really couldn't ask for more now it's up to me.   I have recently started talking to some people that I used to be really good friends with a few years ago. It's so great to talk to them and get caught up on their lives. I have missed so many of them for so long, it feels so awesome to talk to them and to have that companionship again. Well I really need to go, it's time to take a shower and get ready for work.   376.15#

						   Life has a way of throwing you for a loop. The past two weeks have been really stressful. I have been having a hard time staying on plan, and have actually been more off then on. I had been beating myself up over this, I felt like a complete failure. Yesterday Matt, and I went for our mid-month weigh in, and I had actually LOST! Major eye opener. I had spent all this time being down on myself, and here I was coming out ahead. It was just what I needed to get out of that slump.   No one ever said weight loss would be easy, it is probably the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I know though that in the end I will be better for all the struggle. I think that everything happens for a reason. I think that I have spent the better part of my 23 years over weight for a reason. I think that it has not only made me who I am, but better. It has shaped me into being a more caring, and loving person. It has taught me to be a stronger woman. To love with everything that I am, and that I have. I have learned to accept people with a more open heart, and to thank God for all the good things in life. I am blessed with to have such wisdom at such a young age.  This past weekend a friend of mine has reached her goal weight. In just over a year she has lost an amazing 215 pounds! WOW!! She has gone from 390 pounds down to a healthy, and fit 175 pounds. She is such a huge inspiration to myself and so many others. You can read all about Cassey, and see her amazing pictures on " urlLink Getting2Goal Success Stories ", or check out her amazing " urlLink Journal ". Cassey if your reading this... Girl, You ROCK!!.   Okay time for me to run... later!   365.8#

						   Good morning friends. I'm in a bit of a mood today for some reason. I'm just feeling extra emotional today, maybe it's lack of sleep. I have been meaning to post here but just have not had the desire or thoughts to do it. I hate writing when I have absolutely nothing to contribute. Today I have a few things on my mind and I think I will write about them. I am feeling a tab bit sappy, but not in a bad way.   First of all I had my monthly weigh in just a short week ago and I lost 6 pounds 15 ounces last month. Not too bad, but it could have been better. I know the reasons for the small loss... too much eating out, and not enough dedication to exercise. This month I am really going to try harder. No, not just for weight loss, but because I can't afford to eat out! Matt and I spent $80 in one week eating out, that is just pure crazy! So I will take my 6 pound loss... I am at 33.2 pounds loss in 3 months time. Not to shabby if I do say so myself.   Matt and I went and got some pictures developed a few weeks ago. Man do I look different now! Last year my hair was cut way short, and was black. Now a year later it is growing out, and is light strawberry blonde. I also have my "official" before pictures from last year on that film... not a pretty site. I am only about 20 pounds lighter then when that picture was taken, but man what a difference. We did Matt's before from last year and compared it with his recent picture, what a difference 50 pounds has made on him!   So many things have happened in the last year. We moved from small town Indiana to a bigger city in Ohio. Matt and I both started new jobs. Out old car was wrecked in an accident, and we got a new one. We went from a two bedroom apartment to a one bedroom. We went off our diets, and then back on them. We turned another year older, and celebrated our Three Year Anniversary. It's been a year of change, and a year of growing together. Not everything that happened was necessarily good, but we are better for them, I think.   I hope that at this time next year I can look back at this year, and be able to say that my life has truly changed for the better still. I'm growing older and wiser I hope. I am looking forward to a year of new things. At this time next year I want to be more active then I am today, and I want to be living healthier then I have in years. It doesn't seem like it's too big of a goal really... I'm three months into it, I think I can do it!   370.0#

						   My pain is always self-inflicted. I cause the pain in my life, and only I can end it.   It has been almost a month since I stopped caring about myself. People may wonder how that is even possible... I say "How is it not?" It's been a month of eating everything in sight, not exercising, not taking my vitamins, and not getting enough rest.   As I hurt myself like this, I often wonder what I am thinking. Why do I always think... "maybe tomorrow," or "maybe next month." I know that I am ready, so why is this so damn hard?! As I play this tug of war going on inside of me, I wonder if my life will ever NOT be a struggle.&nbsp;   I know, with everything that I am that I should be on track. I know the steps necessary to getting there, so why can't I complete them? Is that next bit of food really worth it? NO! Is that extra hour of sleep worth it? NO! Is that extra hour spent online worth it? NO! I know the right answers... so why do I struggle with following through?   As much as I know what I should do, what I MUST do, something is holding me back. When I figure out what that something is, it's going down! I will go to weigh-in this coming Saturday. I am scared to death at what I will see. I am scared to watch all of my hard work just go down the tube. GAH!   368.15

						   After days, and weeks of abusing myself I am finally back on plan. In all I have to say that this past month off plan, has turned out better then I ever, EVER expected. I gained only two pounds, one ounce... WOW! I was amazed, and so grateful. I feel like God has given me another chance. I feel that he took my weakness, showed me what it would do to my spirit, and raised me above it. I am so thankful for yet another chance, to make a change for the better.   My first mini-goal is coming up in just a months time. My first mini-goal is fifty pounds, in six months. I know that making that goal is not possible now. In some ways I am extremely sad about that, but I also know that this is not a race, and I will get there. I know that no matter what, I will have lost weight. Even if I had only lost ten pounds during the past six months, it would still be ten pounds less then I would have been.   I am blessed in so many ways.  I CAN DO THIS, I CAN WIN!!   I found a few new quotes recently that I really like...   "Choices are the hinges of destiny."   "The undertaking of a new action, brings new strength."
