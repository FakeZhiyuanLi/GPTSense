        I have achieved our next target!   Woot.   Where to strike?   An old munitions dump in Southeastern Tokyo!    (aside) Muahahaha, my "comrades" do not realize it is a trap! I am evil!    It is sounding fun! But I hope this is not a trap!   Worry not, Leader Black Ninja would never deceive us!    (aside) But I would! Muahahaha! ...Evil!    Red Ninja, have you something to contributing to the group?    (coughs)  No, eh, just talking to myself.

        "Sensei! Do you bring missions? More assassination!?"   "No, eager green ninja! I find a colleague!"   "I exist to serve Leader Black Ninja!"   "How noble he is appearing!"   "He copied my stance..."   "Shush, jealous gray ninja! It is a noble stance for you as well!"   -dances- "Yay!"   "We never will be caught with noble red ninja in our forces!"

      Using sophistocated COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY! Police forces have been able to produce this picture:       It depicts the LOCATIONS of the three MINI-NINJAS as they attacked the helpless COMPUTER! Circles represent NINJA-LOCATION and are COLOR-CODED to NINJA-OUTFITS. Two other ninjas were off-screen observing the slaughter, the GREEN NINJA and LEADER BLACK NINJA.

        Due to complaints from about 30% of our readers (one person) I now sport a fancy title!    (pouts)  I get none.   But it is for the sake of distinguishability!  The moral is:  BAD THINGS  CAN  HAPPEN!

        Apparently, there is confusing between Black Ninja and I, the Leader Black Ninja!   This is clearly not neccessary! It is so easy to remember.  (wide-eyed)  Leader Black Ninja has two swords!   Danger!   I, mere Black Ninja, carry a knife, my favored weapon!   Less danger!   So to remember! I am many less dangerous than Leader Black Ninja!   Clearly!         THERE IS A DIFFERENCE   (but similarities aid in NINJA CONFUSING POWER)
