      Well guys and girls , I found the cure for depression/sadness loneliness! I believe that the ONLY Cure for feeling down is hard work :).  After my rather crappy few days (so many highs and lows jeashhh)  Car broke down , I won a large sum of money ( Before the car broke down of course and the car waited till I spent the cash) lol , arguments , losing friends, blah blah blah , being sick it goes on and on!  I have decided that it really doesn't matter what is happening in life , it WILL continue rolling so from now on every time i am feeling low I will simply do as I have for the last few days and find a *Project* . For five years I have wanted to build a website for work , and it never seemed to get done. I have gotten half way there , then lost all my files , or been to busy or whatever.... Anyway , a few weeks ago i came across a site that said *Build your own website FREE* I thought yeah yeah , what's the catch , no way will I ever be able to get it to work , or it will only be avail to USA residents ... I almost talked myself out of it!   Finally being so down and only being interested in Talking to a few people (5 of them weren't even online!, Jimmy-Great Friend, Elu- second Mother,Charlie-best BF i never had, Pete and Nor-very special to my heart )I looked to talk to my best friend BJ.... HA!!!! HE was of course off tarting at playpal(paltalk , I renamed it cause , well that's what i Do :-P ) ,so I looked in wcn....well say no more , I Looked through my favourites to see if there was anything interesting there and found this *build a free website thing* I decided to take a look , cause lets face it we already ascertained much earlier in this Blog , how gullible I am :-P http://www.ecomplanet.com (The link that claimed miracles that were OMG actually TRUE)  So after 24 hours work this is what i came up with :D  http://myweb.ecomplanet.com/GLSC2574/  Frankly I was surprised at what I could do , what I found online to use and am totally CHUFFED at the fact it cost me a total of $0 ... I Do intend registering a domain name in next few weeks and having it changed but hey for a free site i think it is fantastic!  Ok guys , now i sound like a comercial lol  Oh btw ... I noticed that 8 individual people have looked at my profile here? None of you interested in saying hi? Or is it just the fact that my ramblings are meaningless to you? LOL go on I can take it , I DARE the next person who reads this to leave a comment or send a message :-P  Anyway , i had a good day today :)  Talked with all my fav people Charlie,Jimmy,Bj,Pete,Nor and said Hi to Greg , even though I am still upset with him :( . I managed NOT to get in the way of anyone's bad moods , lashing out or general psychosis's . I talked with Reya - The most beautiful girl in the world and Greg's gf. She is adorable! And I basically did nothing all day but work on my site... well technically I did that all last night to , shhhhh Don't tell Bj but I went to bed at 6.36 am ....(he sent me to bed at 3 am)... got up around 11.30ish and haven't even been out of my jammies all day! so I am feeling pretty lazy right now and sleepy , 5 hours is just not enough for me these days ZzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZzzzzz oh oh oops sorry ... Ok guys on THAT note I am out :-P don't call the funny farm JUST yet , I am having way to much fun on the *outside*  Love , Lix and Lollipops  Glyn

      well.... wow another one of those *emotional* days.... after being woken up by some guy wanting to show me the way of the lord this am i was off to a good start.....  so i got online...someone i used to call a friend was in wcn abusing another of her so called friends....i just left , heh once i loved confrontation , still do i guess , but fact is I learnt a lot in the last year or so... You see in January i found out i have an auto immune disease , it is RA , basically what happens is the disease attacks all my joints and muscles... it won't kill me quickly but it will shorten my life... with each *attack* the bones and muscles get weaker.... nothing to stop it just control pain and try to lessen the attacks so that my *remmision* time is more frequent than attack times.... I have already had the disease 20 odd years but was wrongly diagnosed they tell me... then they tell me my *form* of *RA* is not *usual* as it attacks my entire body , from head to foot...  My first attack actually started in sept, by january through to end of feb i got so bad i had difficulty talking... walking was  impossible without aids and support... typing was out... i couldn't even feed myself some days, dress , shower... toilet... when you are sitting there and your mind works but little else you soon realise the important things in life....Stress is a trigger for *attacks* amongst other things   I made a few decisions then.... I decided to let bygones be bygones and the past be just that...I don't need to be the one who stands in the frontline anymore...I don't need to fight other peoples battles . I need to step aside and allow them to do it for themselves. I need to accept things whether i like it or not as i just don't have the strength to fight things that don't matter anymore.  I realised that I still love a man that i have never met and prolly never will...heh even if i could i don't think i want to meet him as it would hurt more realising what will never be . I have accepted that I will spend the rest of my life alone because i could never expect or allow anyone to take on the burden that will be me. Right now they expect my remissions to be about 8-10 months of the year , attacks can be any time or not for months at a time, they last anywhere from a few hours to a few months... and will get progressively worse as time goes on.  So no man will want me and i would never expect it of anyone... my only aim now is to get my kids to adulthood with me being able to care for them as much as possible... the ONE thing that scares me is becoming a burden on THEM... I will do whatever i have to to stop that happenening, so working as hard as i can now to save for my care later. So my heart is carefully locked up and staying that way.  Today i lost a friend... someone i really cared about , she has been going through a rough patch , but has so much anger and is lashing out at everyone , i have tried to deflect the punches but tonight was to much , thing that killed me most was i couldn't even defend myself... that is taking a bit to get used to , they have me on so many damn drugs i forget a lot and am quite placid lol... but i have made the decision not to fight to save our friendship any longer , she went to far...   My biggest fear is being alone... i have come to terms with the fact that i will always be single... but it scares me that i will be alone....with noone. damn i am so morose here of late... but it is weird , i feel sad in a way , sad for losing Jen... guilty even cause i don't have the strength to try to get through to her.but i can't any longer....  but then good things happen , my kids make me smile , or my new puppy does something silly , or my grown up puppy comes for a pat and i feel good... it doesn't kill the loneliness or the fact i hate being alone. My mum once said to me i was born to be a wife , i need to be loved , she is right , but life has a funny way of getting in the way.I have LEARNT to really enjoy the simple things in life and am thankful for that but where to from here? I am 33 years old , i have the body of a 60 year old and they expect me to live to 60-65 at best... what do i do for the next thirty years? where do i go? I have a good job and as it really involves little more than sitting in a chair physically i can do that even when i am quite ill... but there has to be more to life than this...surely it is not over yet. Ok I have crammed a lot into that 33 years , married thrice , had three kids , reached a good  middle rung on the ladder with my career , had some good luck and a lot of bad... i have experienced a lot , learnt a lot, but is there more to life? I want joy , i want to be loved unconditionally , i want comforts without having to fight for it tooth and nail. i want a life void of stress and pain , both physically and emotionally. I DO feel cheated... none of my marriages were happy , first hubby  left when i found out i was pregnant at 17, second one was physically and mentally abusive , he had a ton of *issues* from his childhood... and third well he was perfect at first , the first year was wonderful , i was so happy... then it all imploded and the rest was hell on earth...I thought i would never love again.... But then i did , i fell in love with a guy i have never met , funny thing about that is i used to laugh at people who had *online relationships* then before i knew it i was in one... i loved him so much , like i have never loved before. i was prepared to do whatever it took to be with him , but then things didn't work out ... through circumstances , living situations and the past that neither of us could get over....anyway such is life i guess... it sucks , it knocks you on your ass , then you get up and it does it all over again.I do apologise to anyone silly enough to read my ramblings... but they are just that  , thoughts that go through my head , i write them as they come... I started this blog so i had someone to listen , lol pity it doesn't talk back , i could use some advice sometimes... or some hope.::sighs:: anyway I feel better Blog ty for listening , hopefully tommorrow will be better.   Love , Lix and lollipops  Glyn

      Blah!   i have so much to say today , but words won't come... but i know one thing , i am tired , tired of not being loved , tired of being lonely , tired of trusting/loving to find it is for nothing , tired of watching people and their messed up minds... i am tired of fighting , tired of being sick , just plain old tired.....

      Well Yesterday was a brilliant but VERY busy day!Party was Fab and went with few hassels! but as is usually the case ended in tears... Poor Tara I think it was to much for her! I have a ton of food and cake left over ,and the house is a wreck but oh well a girl only turns ten once i guess. I relearnt a brilliant lesson though! paying the $12 bucks a head at the leisure centre so they do all the work would have been the clever thing to do! Oh and that game *pass the parcel* is dumb stupid and causes HUGE fights! I invented a new game though , i had the kids stand on one side of the yard , I armed the big boys with water ballons!, Rules were girls had to run through to other side of yard without being hit with a bomb , if they made it they were in, if not they were out , we did that till we had a winner!... After the party , I had to go shopping , all went well till I decided to buy a piece of furniture.... unfortunately with four kids in the car i couldn't fit it in....Guy at the store suggested i *double the kids up* I decided NOT a good idea , thank Goodness i didn't.... Five blocks from home some idiot woman was driving with no lights so i didn't see her and then pulled out in front of her! she missed me by mere inches..... 3 blocks from home a bloody dog ran in front of me i just missed him , and then 2 blocks from home i could see emergency services flashing lights in the distance, seems there was a huge car accident just outside my house! So i am taking all those things as an omen not to drive today!although i prolly will cause i still need to get my tv unit home...  lol oh well   So after all that FUN , i came home and was invited to join *sky's voice room* , greg begged me so i couldn't say no... I love Greg :D (greg=mort) so , in the end , Greg,Bj,me and jimmy chatted all night in voice ,after I dragged greg out and we made our own room , THAT went down well NOT!(and No , i am not a slut i just prefer mens company to most fems LOL)Nor and Elu are NOT women , they are Goddesses.... anyway I will bbl , i have to work for the next few hours arghhh it's sundy so not fair!   Love Lix and Lollipops!  Glyn

      well , what a day this has been i think i have experienced every emotion there is.... sadness, happiness, joy... depression... pity... the list goes on and on...  it started with my usual morning visit to wcn.... i recently started a wcnawards poll through yahoo , the purpose of this was to pat those on the back who work so tirelessly there , all mons and reg chatters there work hard to keep it a safe chat.... and all is voluntary.  but as usual we have people who are thin skinned , others who think , YAY now i can have a go at people WITHOUT actually saying it to their faces... why are people so damned pathetic?  Anyway then i  had a client , that was fun , i laughed and cried with her.... Then came back here again , was just doing banking etc before shopping.... anyway i ended up spending three hours here instead (blames Charlie) and was late to go shopping for Tara's party , my little girl is ten tommorrow! yayyyyy  Then my ex husband was pissed cause he had to actually look after the kids while i was gone ( you will notice i very rarely mention my ex , but a quick rundown , he is mentally ill , an alcoholic  but clean for the time being , when he is clean  I allow him to spend time with the kids , we get on ok , but our relationship is  only for the kids , some would call us *friends* but I feel a friend is someone you have something in common with.. i have nothing in common with him these days....He  is a sad old man... I feel pity for him , i care if he is sick/injured or homeless , but then i care about anyone in that position...My counsellor says i am not normal but hey it is who i am . I have been known on many occasions to bring home sick or injured strays , both the 2 legged kind and the four legged kind, poor woman almost had a heart attack when i told her that 5 years ago , while being stranded in floods i met a family of hubby/wife 2 kids who were trying to start afresh after he was released from jail...I took them all home after water went down and cared for them helping them start again. I guess i believe that everyone deserves a second chance and that ultimately people can change IF they want to.....lol but as you would expect , they didn't start again , both went right back to heroin and kids ended up in foster care.( hears you all laughing at gullible me)   anyway , my feeling is i gave them the chance and would do so again , cause sometimes it takes people more than once to get it right. As far as Stephen goes , he will never be well again... and even if he was , i have outgrown him , my only aim as far as he is concerned is to allow my girls To know their dad for as long as he is alive ... you see i never knew my dad , i have talked to him on the phone , but never met him , our first contact was just 3 years ago...i know what it felt like growing up , having no idea who he was , what he looked like...  All my friends even though some had parents who were divorced or dad's that had passed on , knew their dad's , they knew if they looked like him , if they acted like him...they knew HIM , good or bad. My girls know the situation , they know their dad is sick , they know that this *sober* period won't last . they know he will wander off and live on the streets again , but they know that next time might be the last... he has caused us a lot of pain yes... me so much that i will never forgive him,,,but ultimately the girls love him and need him... so i will never take that from them.Some people  in my life don't and never will understand . But  my take on love and relationship break ups is : they were once good enough for you to love , after all is said and done those quality's are still there only things are changed , i don't hate any of my ex's , i never will .... but it doesn't mean i am in love with them either ... (well ok , possibly I love one a bit more than i should but that's ok cause i am not living in a pipe dream)  WOW I DO RAMBLE ON   Anyway after that I spent some time with Charlie( i will dub him the best bf i never had) , he had me in fits of laughter... then shopping and then home to prep for the party...I am excited on one hand and dreading the thought of 20 ten year olds for four hours in my house...oh the joys of motherhood....   We had a hacker attack at wcn , but as i was late shopping i actually missed all the fun then i sent a friend of mine a letter telling her to wake up to herself , she is in love with a guy online.... he loves her but wants nothing more than online so she is destroying herself over it , and pushing those few friends she has left away....   Now i am rambling so better get my ass to bed , cause it is 1.30 am and i need to be up early  Love,licks and lollipops to all who aren't reading this crap and if you are good luck cause i doubt anyone will follow it  Glyn
