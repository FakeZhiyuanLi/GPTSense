      I feel cheated. The only reason I attended the night of laughter this evening was to watch Keith Tan perform, but in the end the only part he performed was the 'radio dialogue' part at the end, of which he had a very minor role of just a few lines. And so, I spent 10 dollars, travelled all the way to school and back, froze in the lt for 2 hours in expectation for something that turned out to be a fizzle.  Other than the night of laughter, today was a rather uneventful. I got woken up at 7.30 am to go run some errands with my mom, after which I just bummed around the place. Ard 12 noon I returned back to bed, and after that had a series of ever shortening naps, which ended around 3. Each time I fell asleep I dreamt of something different, and each time it seemed more profound. I realize that I dream when I'm not very tired. If I'm super tired and go sleep, I'll just conk out and wake up seemingly the next instant. But if I take a nap like today simply because I know I'll need the sleep later, then I'll start dreaming all kinds of weird stuff. It gets even weirder by the dream. After waking up I decided to play abit of Allegiance, which turned out to be another frustrating noob game... Gah. They're now too many noobs in Allegiance... More pros, or at least someone with a teaspoon of commonsense, should join. There was supposed to be parade today, but I decided not to go mainly because I didn't really feel well. Just my luck. Today's parade turned out to be the slackest EVER. It started with the usual ag (accountability group) session, then a very short drill session. This was followed by the viewing of 'Band of Brothers' until the end of parade! Gosh... Of all times to miss parade. Ah well.  Not many people went to the night of laughter... Considering the play was only held twice, the viewship was quite low. For today's screening the lt 2 was only three quarters filled. For me, I was with Ag, Peter and of course Adeline :P Those 2 arz... In matching black summore. As for the play itself, it was literally a 'night of laughter'. Very entertaining. Unfortunately though, as stated above, I was rather disappointed as I did not get to see Keith Tan actually act. He was just reciting a few lines. Other than that, stellar performances by the drama people and teachers like Mrs Geetha Creffield and Miss Michelle Wong caused this to be a really, really wonderful play. Strangely the theme for the night seemed to be that of marriage. As my friend says 'it was sex written all over it'. Oh and Roy rocked! For once his strange accent actually came to very good use... It was perfect! :P After the play the 4 of us went to bk at holland v to eat... Again. To think I just went there the day before...  I didn't feel like eating anything, and so I didn't. Just sat there while the other 3 of them gobbled up their stuff... When it was around 2230 Adeline's parents came to pick her up, and so Peter, ag and me made our way to the MRT and from there, home. I reached home like 5 minutes ago... Around 2350. My mom was telling me to be home early... As usual. Oh grah my mom woke up... Now she's bitching at me... Something's wrong. Gotta go.

      My sleeping cycle is like really screwed. On thursday afternoon I slept at 6 pm, woke up at 3 am on friday, and I've been awake since then... So thats about 21 hours and 20 minutes. Bleargh. More about Friday later.   Thursday was supposed to be my &nbsp;slack day. I have only GP and Chinese tutorials on that day... Thus its quite a slack day for me... Especially the double maths lecture as its now not keith tan teaching&nbsp; (woot!) He's a good lecturer, but that's where the problem lies. He always catches me sleeping. Gah. I digress. Anyway the day wasn't slack coz I had some heavy conditioning for P.E. and a chem test at the 3rd last period of the day. Conditioning, which consisted of the usual running and pull up training, was heavier than usual as I decided to push myself harder today after what my ct said to me. Problem is, the bruise that the nurse said would appear if I exerted my arm did appear. So now the area near the needle hole is blue in colour... Looks kinda sick. Project work period was taken up by a project work lecture... Our was by &nbsp;a certain Michelle Wong... Zhi thinks she's a real eloquent and good teacher... I agree wif the eloquent part... She sounds like she's trying to fake this ang mo accent... But good teacher? Damnit I feel asleep after the first 5 minutes... Only to be awakened by her 'could you please wake that gentleman please?' I could feel the scarsm dripping from her pouty lips. The entire lecture was equally boring... Me and zk were simply kept nodding off to sleep... For me I had to really work myself hard to keep myself awake... Already got caught once... As for zhi, sitting next to zk, he listened in rapt attention... I dunno how he does it... It's like he's in love with her or something... :P Later we had our chem test... I must say it wasn't tricky at all, that being it didn't have any confusing or misleading questions... So if u studied it''ll be very easy to get full marks. As for me... I didn't study... So go figure :( The end of the day was capped by a double chinese period, in which we watched some show, then did some group discussion and presentation on various cultures... I'm not sure about the show part coz Stella dragged me to go get her acjc login password, thus making both of us miss the first period... Bah where's Shaun when u need him... :P When I reached home, after a rather enjoyable trip back with Shiqin and Charmaine, I bathed and... slept at 6pm.  Which brings us to yesterday, Friday. I was woken up at 3 am by my mom... Apparently my brother went out of the room to blow his nose. When he came back, he closed the door too loudly and woke up my mom. Thinking it was me coming back after playing the com until 3, my mom got up and started pinching and slapping me till I woke up. When the foul up was found out, she didn't even apologize! Ah well. I couldn't sleep, so I got up and started doing my homework, till 6 am, when I left for school. As a result of leaving compartively earlier, I reached school at 6.50 am. Going to the hall I found lifeng sleeping... When she woke up I bummed a while wif her, then I saw yong ming wif his guitar... I koked his guitar and then went downstairs wif leaf for the prayer group thing... I realize our attendance is dropping - there were only 6 of us yesterday. Later during physics prac my physics tutor spent the first half an hour giving us a big scolding. The cause? We all handing up work late. That by itself is quite understandable, considering the lacklustre attitude of my class. The crux of the issue is that the day before she told us that if we handed all our late homework in by friday, we would not need to go d/c. That's wad most of us did. Unfortunately the more&nbsp;she scolded us, the more angry&nbsp;she got, and in the end she decided&nbsp;that we all had to go d/c, one&nbsp;session for each piece of late homework. For me that&nbsp;means 3 d/c sessions. Bah. I feel that was a bad move, no matter how justified that might be... In that one simple&nbsp;act&nbsp;she had&nbsp;simply lost her credibility, at least in our eyes. Credibility is extremely important to the&nbsp;operational abilities of a teacher, especially a jc teacher. The rest of the tutorial periods passed quickly, and soon it was time to go d/c... For d/c I basically finished up my physics prac... (Yesterday's one) Skill D really takes alot of writing.  After d/c I went for cf... Before that I met some friends who&nbsp;came back to ACJC for the Night of Laughter. Hey u all should go! I heard it's really funny... During cf, my nuture group (Selena's) combined with Bobby's. Mrs Rosalind Tan gave quite a good sharing about hearing God and she recommended a good book to us... She talked about how we should turn our senses to Jesus, and seek him. After cf some of us went out for supper as usual at Holland V. Time passed rather quickly, especially as yong ming and me were talking to a former GEP 2 years my senior who had come back from MIT for 3 months... It was quite an interesting and eye-opening experience. I hope to go to some Uni in the states&nbsp;when I graduate... I ended up taking the MRT back with him, all the way to Aljunied, when he got off and I continued to Tanah Merah. On the MRT we were gossiping about ACS(I) GEP stuff :P Lucky he didn't get taught by Grace Khoo...  Yeah so here am I now... Gosh I'm uber tired... Been awake for 22 hours... Oh I just got hooked on wings again... Anyone whose pro in wings teach me all the tricks... Btw remember to pray for Christine's recovery from her operation!

      I really should have ponned school. All I needed was a parents letter and I'll be free for entire day! I actually persuaded my parents to write that letter. My case was that since we had to leave class early for our lunch, and since it was wednesday, the short cca day, I won't learn much from going to school. Also, I would be back extremely late as the finals were expected to finish at 7 plus... It was a perfectly planned, executed plan that once again was gone to waste due to a simple act of temptation. I decided to play Allegiance.&nbsp;The time&nbsp;was 11.30 pm. My parents had been asleep for an hour. I thought: Since I didn't need to go to school tml, why not play abit of Allegiance? And so I did. The game started out good. Unfortunately this was on the noob server (there was no other server wif enuff pple), we started losing due to stupid reasons like... Not defending. With every miner/techbase/outpost lost I grew even more frustrated. Furthermore, I was a vet comming on a noob server... Determined to win the game, I continued playing, and thus didn't notice my mom until she was standing behind me. By then, it was of course too late... As a result both my parents refused to write the letter... Not wanting to spend&nbsp;4 dollars on an MC, I had to go to school... :(   What a mistake it was. I already got scolded in the first period...&nbsp;Guess who scolded me? Rahimah! I forgot to bring my econs tys... In the end she made me write a letter of apology, of which I crapped one whole page full... She ended up laughing when she read it and so she forgave me lol... Otherwise I was supposed to do d/c on thurs. Not like it mattered... I have to do d/c anyway for not handing up my physics prac :( Anyway the rest of the lessons were just... Usual, until physics. Chan Boon Hwee gave our class abit of the dressing down, because we kinda never listened in class, making all easily avoidable mistakes... She seemed to be looking at me directly when she said that if we&nbsp;listen more and sleep less in class, we'll do very well. Ah well. After physics lecture my class was dismissed to go for our lunch. Roberta Tan, our class ct who was absent for the past 3 weeks, made our class meet her at the bleachers. After settling the class admin, she dismissed the class and talked to me... My break was 1 hour, but I was dismissed after only 45 minutes...&nbsp;Coz Roberta&nbsp;was discussing alot of stuff wif me...&nbsp;She said that she found me very skeptical and negative for someone of my youth... Can't help thinking how much of that is because of my family problems...&nbsp; *hush hush* Also said that she would like to see me work harder because she can see that I have the potential... Sounds familiar? Sighz. In the&nbsp;short while that we were talking I somehow felt I knew her alot better... She used to seem like the ct/pe teacher who just took our class for 5 periods a week, but she now seems to be alot more caring and concerned for at least my welfare... Interesting what a few words can make of a person's impression of you.   The National Track Finals was... Boring. The ACJC supporters, with the exception of the SCs,&nbsp;couldn't be bothered to cheer, and thus it looked quite comical when the SCs tried to make us cheer... The ACS(I) supporters were about the same too... To make things worse, it started raining. Periodically. Rain, stop, rain, stop. So the ACJC pple were like running up and down the steps, seeking shelter when it rained, and coming out when it stopped. The situation on the track wasn't much better either... The sports school more or less swept everything... Naturally. As for the A division ACJC didn't seem to farewell, due to some mishap in the heats which caused ACJC to be out of the 4X100 relay or something... One of its supposedly promising events. In the end Joel, Ag and me left about 5 plus and just went home... Quite a disappointing finale =P   Oh btw I can finally play the guitar again! Before the blood donation they pricked the tip of my 4th left finger to check my iron level. As a result I couldn't play the guitar coz my finger would hurt badly... Haha it seems to have finally healed... Yay! Mmmkays... Mom's scolding liao... Sighz. Must go study for chem... Bleargh.   Cuz: Chill yeah? Terms were meant to be hard... And econs isn't meant to be easily understood... Once u understand the basic stuff u can just bullshit and still get high marks k? Like dun drop econs just coz u're doing badly now... Its not really hard once u understand it... Serious! :P

      Lol I feel asleep after eating dinner yesterday, so I didn't blog... Slept for a total of about 9 hours! Yet I'm still so very sleepy in school... Even though the day before I slept only 45 minutes and yet was super awake. Ah about yesterday... I was rushing my econs, coz if u get taught by Rahimah u'll know how much she hates people not doing her work. As I was rushing to finish my econs homework I met Peter online... Like he pinged me first... Apparently he was bored. So I ended up talking to him and doing my homework... The problem is talking to him caused me to do my essays rather slowly, so time dragged on, till I finally finished my essays at 0500 hrs! Before that, at 0430 hrs, my dad woke up. He checked on me, naturally. I heard the squeal of the door hinge and looked back, saw him, and quickly alt-tabbed. Haha but he scolded me abit for being awake at 4.30 am, then went back to slp... Anyway I decided to slp at 0500 hrs since Peter seemed to be daoing me and I had finished my econs. Unfortunately I forgot to tell him so he ended up waiting for me to come online again all the way till 6+... As for me I went back to slp, only to wake up at 5.45 am and prepare to go to school... Even then I was super awake! I didn't sleep at all, even in the double econs tutorial.  Oh about the tutorial. The stupid tutorial that made me stay up until 5 am. Rahimah has been scolding my class&nbsp;during every tutorial&nbsp;in the past few weeks, and so my class&nbsp;aimed to do&nbsp;our homework, for once, and not get scolded.&nbsp;We almost succeeded. After Chinese, the period before econs, me and Jon Chan ran up the stairs so fast I almost banged into this gurl I didn't see. Lol. Only to realize that Rahimah was late for class. *boggleZ* During econs essay, no one slept and everyone was relatively attentive :P Even Rahimah seemed in a good mood. Oh but guess who had to spoil it. When the 2nd period was gonna end, Rahimah asked a few people to go up to the board and draw a few diagrams. One of those people was Jeanette. Gah. Jeanette. Stupid bitchy&nbsp;bimbo-without-the-looks. Rahimah dosen't mind if&nbsp;we&nbsp;didn't know&nbsp;how to draw the diagram, coz it was quite hard, but Jeanette didn't even know how to draw the AC curve, which is quite a basic, must know kinda thing. So we got a scolding - as usual. Bleargh. All that hard work for nothing. Later in the day was physics test. It was quite easy. Unfortunately Soong didn't give the LT time reminders, so alot of people didn't finish when she said 'Pens down!'. Haha I remember hearing Sarah (I think that's her name) from Sb1 cursing. AS for me... I had fallen asleep. So I just woke up and handed in my script. Yeah that's pretty much for yesterday.  Today I woke up feeling quite refreshed, after sleeping 9 hours. Too bad that feeling didn't last. Nothing much really happened today, except that I slept during econs lecture... Again. I just remember trying to understand the monopolistic competition graph that Rahimah drew on the board, but suddenly started dreaming about Allegiance, then suddenly jumping up when I heard 'Alvin, wake up.' I'm like programmed to her voice man... Pple like me dun wake up even when its a thunderstorm. According to Russell I physically jumped. Whoa. Oh I also got back my physics test... I got 15/25. Gah. Top in class is a mere 17/25. I feel quite... Guilty. When my teacher gave me back my script she told me that if I actually bothered to present my answers correctly I'll have gotten full marks. All the 10 marks minused were because I didn't write a 'N2l' here, a 'therefore force on b by a' there, etc etc... That set me thinking... She's not the only teacher to tell me that... Recently alot of teachers have been telling me I have the potential to do very well, if only I bothered to try. Sighz. They are right I guess, just that I never have the willpower to do so... Easier said then done. Bah. I sometimes see pple like Lucas study so hard and yet get only slightly better results, and me... Ah well. Another prayer request.   After school I went for Physics Olympiad training. Yong Kiat's quitting po! Gratz to him for making it to the band comm btw... But now po is gonna be so lonely... Pei Xian and me are the only non SA pple... Its always so quiet there, such that the soundwaves are dominated by the scratching of pencils on paper... It's always a relief to get outta there, especially since I try, but fail to, understand anything in there... I blame it mainly on Daniel Khor. The guy dosen't -teach-. He simply writes a few equations on the board and expects everyone to be able to solve it... Like only one person can. Some scholar (duh!) from SA1.  Tomorrow my class is one of those selected to go to the National Stadium to go support our school team in the track and field finals. Go AC! Still... It means the entire day is gone :( I dun see why they actually force people to go and all... T'here's not much point is there? If u force a person to go it kinda defeats the purpose... Well at least its much nearer my house :P Too bad for pple like Charlie bahahaha.

      My church had a blood donation drive today.&nbsp;After a rather interesting service of which I confess I have no memories of, I was&nbsp;hanging around the open space between the 2 church buildings and talking to Noel Ong... Oh btw to all those who weren't there his worship was real good... Especially the songs... It was those songs that both the youth and the adults would enjoy... That dosen't happen very often :P So for once the sanctuary was actually resonating with the voice of praise, filling all the nooks and crannys with the blessings of God.   Mmm.&nbsp;About the blood donation. I didn't really plan to donate blood coz I have a lot of work today, and for the next 24 hours or so after you donate, you feel kinda sleepy. Also my family was going to my old house to clean and clear the place.&nbsp;Yet just as I finished talking with Noel, Andy and this other gurl who I can't rmb (s'ry!) dragged me to the blood donation place... Stupid Andy... He can't donate coz he's still on malaria pills so he goes and drags all of us to donate. Gah. Anyway so I filled up the form, which had all this complicated&nbsp;terms&nbsp;on it... Unfortunately I was under 18, so I needed parental consent. The problem was, my parents had just left the church.&nbsp;Bleargh. As a result&nbsp;I had to call them, then had to wait for them to come and sign the form. That done, I waited in the queue to see the doctor. Wendy and her sis, whose name I can't rmb, joined me. Haha we were all transfixed at the other donors in the room, especially poor Albert, who went before me and was getting his picture taken repeatedly by a bubbly Andy. Also Stephanie came and was mothering him like her own kid :P Rofl. The doctor was some damn funny Indian guy... He just basically confirmed what I had indicated on the form. Strangely they didn't do tests... Anyway he kept pestering me whether I had sex or not. Lol. 'Do you have sex with only one partner?' 'Did you have sex with&nbsp;a person you have only known 6 months?' 'Did you pay anyone to have sex with you?' *boggleZ* Haha but he was kiddin lar... Anyway after that I went to a nurse, who pricked my finger to check my iron level, then it was time for the donation! I requested for the needle to be on my left hand so I could write my compo when I go home - poor Russell couldn't write after he donated lol... Unfortunately there was no available chair with the needle on the left side, so I had to do it on my right... Basically, the procedure is quite painless... Except the painkiller shot (what irony). Apparently I looked petrified, coz the nurse and Andy kept talking to me... Lol. I just wanted them to do it quickly, and so I told them to so. Yeah. So its quite simple - A painkiller shot, then the real needle goes in. Normally they cover the entry hole with a wad of cotton wool, but they didn't do so for mine... So I could see the 1mm thick needle entering my skin and the slight bump beside the hole... Also could see my blood trickling down into the bag. Funky. Suddenly I&nbsp;heard a soft 'ouch'. Guess what? Wendy's sis just got her hand pricked... And she started crying! Lol. Meanwhile my blood bag was about half full, so I just kept squeezing and squeezing, hoping to get the phat needle out of my vein. After what seemed like 5 minutes I looked back again - the bag was still half full! The nurse frowned and fuzzed about my hand. Something about my vein collapsing... So she had to like hold the needle down, which made it hurt more... Muahaha I can feel all your skin crawling *grinz* Anyway the nurse finally gave up and cut the tube... Apparently it was a blood clot in the tube. Lol. And Andy just had to remind me that I -might- have a higher chance of surviving a gunshot wound that way. Rofl. Problem was all the while I had been squeezing the damn ball, so I now have this rather bad bruise on my vein... Coz well imagine trying to pump blood thru a stuck tube. The poor nurse, who kept saying 'exercise your hand!' kept apologizing... She rubbed some funny cream on the bruise, which honestly hurt much more in total than the needles ever did, and after that I was basically free to go. Oh this cute boy gave me the cert haha... 'Are you Alvin Toh?' 'Thank you for donating your blood and saving a life!' Sounds just like a computer with a cute voice track.   After donating&nbsp;I went up to 2nd service, just in time for the closing song. I met zhi! The twert told me that he'll donate but&nbsp;I think he woke up late or smthing :P Anyway since he had disciple group later in the day, he decided to go home and I took a lift from him to MRT. His parents, though, decided to stop by to eat tim sum and so they&nbsp;treated me too :P Thanks! When I reached home I basically just...&nbsp;Stoned around and slept. Ah yes... Sleep. I think donating blood does make you feel sleepy... I&nbsp;have half a mind not&nbsp;to go&nbsp;to school&nbsp;since my arm hurts when I move it and like... Marc felt dizzy during BB one day after he donated his... Hmm.&nbsp;The stupid needle wound&nbsp;starts to hurt&nbsp;everytime I&nbsp;squeeze my arm or smthing... Gah. So, its back to work, work and work. With my CCAs I simply have no time to do anything from the time school ends on friday to when school starts on Monday, save for a free Sunday evening. Terrible. Need to find some way to do homework in school... I already have a massive backlog and teachers are hounding me... Blearghz.

      Today, I woke up late... As expected. So tired. Seeing that I had 55 minutes to reach ACJC for my GP test, I decided to take a taxi. Unfortunately just as I stepped out of the house it started raining. Sighin, I opened up my umbrella and walked out to the road with my mom. See, my mom needed to go TJC for some sailing thingy... Weird. Soon a taxi came, but the driver apparently had no idea where TJC or ACJC was. *bogglez* ACJC maybe I can understand, but TJC? TJC's just around the bend from my house. Anyway the driver was some blur guy... His face looks like its made of rubber or smthing. After dropping my mom off, he made his way to ACJC. There's only one problem. On the open ECP highway, with no cars in front of him, he drove at 60 km/h. Crazy. We were like crawling on the damn road... Stupid guy. Then everytime he had to make a turn he slowed to 40 km/h then slooooooooooowly turned his taxi... Dunno wads wrong wif him sia... Like he knows I'm late, otherwise I won't be taking a taxi with the MRT station just nxt to me rite. In the end when I finally told him to hurry up he acclerated, only to find that we were stuck in a jam all the way to buona vista. Why? Coz of some stupid car accident between a van and car... Later he dropped me at the foyer, 40 minutes after I got on the taxi! Gah. That's twice as long as the normal journey... Might as well have taken mrt. Anyway my test was in the MPH, which was in the Sports Complex, which was, well, across the field. Lucky there's some covered walkway on the way there. Still, it was kinda useless coz the rain was so strong I was soaked by the time I reached the complex, my umbrella notwithstanding. At least not as bad as some people who walked all the way from MRT... They looked like they just jumped into the pool or smthing...   In the end, GP test started late to accomodate those who came late... Poor tkh... Come 15 minutes late then he decided not to go in and just got an MC. Lol. And to think that he woke up earlier than me summore... GP test was quite easy, at least much easier then the term tests. I'm quite worried about my compo thou. I wrote for like 40 minutes and then just spent the remaining 50 minutes exploring slumberland. I did essay topic 1: Law offenders should be punished severely. Do you agree? Mmm alot of Sb1 pple wrote the same topic but pple like Pei Xian apparently wrote... 3 sides? I only wrote 2. And my handwriting is definitely bigger than hers :P   With the test done, I trooped down to ACSI for BB parade... Tkh walked me to the dover rd busstop... Haha smthing funny happened... When we reached the busstop, tkh just veered away and said 'byebye'. Naturally I was kinda shocked and asked him where he was going, since I thought he was coming to acsi wif me... I couldn't hear wad he said, it sounded like he was mumbling or something... I was puzzled until I looked down and saw... rQ. Rofl. I didn't see her :P S'ry rQ! Bahaha. Leaving them to their *ahem* exploits I continued on to ACSI. There I koked dz's brasso and started polishing in the canteen... Soon Yong kiat and his band friend joined us... Haha his mouth hanged open when he saw dz doing his 'spit and polish' routine... I think the jaw kinda got affixed there or something... It seemed open for an awfully long time :P For BB parade, we did our 1 hour Accountability Group (ag). Its like a cell group thingy... My group consists of about 6&nbsp;sec 2s&nbsp;or so... Supposed to help interacting and fellowship&nbsp;*shrug*&nbsp;Anyway today's discussion topic was 'BGR'. Lol. As expected, it was almost impossible to have any dialogue at all... How do u get sec 2s to talk about something that they haven't even experienced yet? Gah. Most of them still look like... Babyish :P The poser ones are like in sec 3 and above. After ag, we did some warm-ups, courtesy of the 3 canoers in BB,&nbsp;then played Chairball, which is basically Captain's ball except that a pail (in our case) was used to catch the ball. Stupid Hanyang... He can jump so high he can reject the damn ball... So any team&nbsp;playing against him would -never- get a shot in... He jumped higher than the guy -on- the chair could reach. Even with the pail to help him. Gosh. After the games was the ROD service at the CPA, then the presentation ceremony outside at the parade ground. Quite impressive, I must say.   After the parade ag (Alvin Goh) told me he was going cell. So I changed into my ACJC uniform and packed all my stuff. Just as I finished he suddenly told me his dad was picking him up from ACSI and thus he wasn't going. *boggleZ*&nbsp;So I just went home...&nbsp;Much needed rest awaits me. Btw I think I want to start&nbsp;some Allegiance parody or something...   For those&nbsp;deprived people who have no idea what Allegiance is, the link is on the sidebar. Its a RTS and FPS&nbsp;space combat game. Basically imagine playing a normal RTS game with miners, buildings and tech trees?&nbsp;The only&nbsp;difference in this case is that every combat unit is actually a living human pilot. And yes its online. In the game u mine he3, which gives you money, which allows u to build miners, tech up, build buildings, etcetc... The game's very comprehensive, and u can do alot of things in the game. Things like stealth bombers, pulse probes, teleport probes, solar inverters and boosters make this game a very fun game to play... Its not one of those cliche shoot 'em up games... Do play it. Any problems during installation tell me. Its another of those by the players for the players thingy, so do donate if u can... Ah yes and the best thing about the game is that its lagless! It was designed for coms about 4, 5 years back. Thus a decent modern com should have no problems&nbsp;running it. Yet the graphics are real good... For example press f11 to access the third person view. Then press tab to boost. Look at the vapour trail... Very realistic. Hope to see more pple there... The Singapore player base is way too small...

      There's one very appropiate word to describe my entire day: Exhaustion, and lots of it. The day started with me attempting to crawl out of bed... The night (or morning) before I slept at 2 am. While that's not exactly very late, I've been sleeping late the previous few nights too... Thus I was like totally woozed out. After a while I gave up and simply fell asleep leaning against the cupboard till my mom's repeated screams finally jerked me out from my slumber. Later on the mrt I overslept again. I managed to wake up at dover&nbsp;again... At least it's only one stop.  Through out the entire day I was rushing to annotate countless group articles... We only need 2 group annotated articles for this check but considering karno... *shrugs* During physics prac the teacher called me aside and talked to me for a while... Kept tellin me I was underachieving, that she could see I knew the answers but lacked the practice to present them in the proper way and thus lost marks. Said it was a waste of talent and that I should work hard, cause I was capable of so much more. That sounds exactly like what the econs teacher said to me a while ago... Sighz. Everyone, even my parents, seem to think I'm very smart or something... Must be some GEP thing. Though I agree wif them that I should work harder... Though the mind is willing, the body is weak :( Following physics prac was a double chinese period, half of which was used for chinese test. As usual I didn't bother to study and thus left the fill in the blank parts completely blank... Da poor chinese teacher looked very disappointed... She's supposed to be the most inspiring teacher in the entire school, used to teaching classes like mine... But somehow I have a feelin she's met her match. She's like on the verge of breakin down in class when trying to teach.&nbsp;I feel sympathy for her sometimes and do try to do her homework, but well. Its chinese. 'nuff said.  Later during lunch I was talkin to some of my acsi friends. When I mentioned the name 'Bryan Chua', one of them&nbsp;choked on his fishball, the other went 'F.CK!' Yeaps. That pretty much sums out how&nbsp;the&nbsp;acsi pple think of him...&nbsp;One of my friends said that his face resembles a punching bag. Honestly, I can't help but agree. Sometimes I feel guilty about how we're treating him yet Bryan... seems to ask for it. Gah.  After lunch was the worst part in my entire timetable. 4 tutorial periods, in a row, in the same class. This time it was worse coz the&nbsp;gpf submission deadline was 1630 hrs that day, when school ended. Thus many groups were blatantly doing their annotations in front of the teacher, mine included. Also we were rushing to do our econs homework, coz Rahimah is extremely particular about homework. She expects us to prepare the completely written essays before she goes thru in class. We can't even use points -&nbsp;we have to write out the essay in full. For those who dun take econs, one essay question should take about 2 to 3 sides of a normal fullscap paper. Go figure. Rahimah works hard, but she works her students hard too. Gah. Anyway during GP, just before econs, I kinda freaked out. Like I just suddenly felt at a loss of what to do... Kinda scary, for someone like me. Coz I'm gp rep, and I was rushing to finish annotating the articles and to complete the econs essay to be discussed for&nbsp;the next period&nbsp;and another piece of already late&nbsp; econs homework. Then suddenly Beatrice (my GP teacher) just dumps this whole pile of stuff on my table and asks me to distribute to the class. That done, I then had to like&nbsp;sort the extras coz like one third of my class ponned. After that she realized that she forgot to photocopy this thing. So I had to run down and do it. By that time there was 10 more minutes of GP left, and my econs homework was hardly finished. At that moment I just... Stoned? A friend said later that I was moaning or smthing. In any case it just felt terrible. In the end I did get the GP stuff done and managed to make it in time to econs tutorial. We changed the venue today. For those fortunate not to get taught by Rahimah, anybody later than 5 min for tutorials is punished, the extent of which is determined by her mood. So my class pretty much ran up the staircase to the class. And guess what? Rahimah was on course! *boggle* All my insane rants for nothing :P Gah but more&nbsp;exhaustion was to come.&nbsp; After econs was chem, after which I had physics remedial for 2 hours! Insane man... Worse thing was I had to absent myself from quite abit of cf. Suxors. Heh by the time I dragged myself into lt 2 I was like a ghost of my old self, like a machine on autopilot.   Ah yes. For those who would like to come to the Christian Fellowship's (CF)&nbsp;meetings they are every friday, 5pm, at lt2. Our meetings consists mainly of worship, followed by a bit of sharing depending on the programme. Following which, there will be a message by normally Pastor Barnabas.&nbsp;After that&nbsp;we split into our nuture groups, which&nbsp;resemble&nbsp;cell&nbsp;groups.&nbsp;In our nuture groups we discuss the message&nbsp;and we pray.&nbsp;That done,&nbsp;we go down into the void deck to&nbsp;tuck in to Ms Rosalind Tan's delicious food. And to fellowship of course&nbsp;:P&nbsp;For&nbsp;the uninformed,&nbsp;fellowship means... Like&nbsp;meeting and interacting with other christians, so yeah this is&nbsp;one of the more significant times of our meetings.&nbsp;During this time we just talk, hang around, pray&nbsp;sometimes, and&nbsp;engage in 'fellowship'.&nbsp;From this time onwards u can leave anytime you want, but some of us normally go to Holland V later for supper. So yeaps. That pretty much sums it up.   Mmm back to the day of exhaustion.&nbsp; I'm now at home, blogging and polishing for full U parade tml. My schedule tml is gonna be packed... It starts wif stupid GP common test in the morning, then chemistry remedial, then full U parade, then cell group. Furthermore my cell's in charge of the movie magiXS tml. Bleargh. Crap I see a kink in my toe cap! Oh btw its the debating finals tml! ACJC vs RJC. About 3pm, TJC. Those who can go support do go... Ciao. Stupid @%!^&amp; Boots...

      Today was&nbsp;an interesting day. The day started with a rather rousing and forceful devotion by Brian, challenging us to cause a revival in ACJC. I really think he's got the gift for evangelism, he should do such devotions more. Heh maybe that's why he was the evangelism ic in the cf comm :P Unfortunately, it was quite disappointing to hear the scarstic remarks and giggles that were emanating from the region around me. Though as Ms Rosalind Tan puts it 'there will always be opposition to those who spread the word', its still kinda disheartening. Following that was PE. Yay! We played badminton muahaha. It was quite fun, until later 3 other classes came and since the badminton hall couldn't accomodate all of us at once we played some inter-class tournament thingy... It was quite hastily and thus badly planned so me and my partner, Russell, could only play like one 'real match' against Jared and Zhic. Rofl... I realize my backhand sucks now... Zhic saw that and exploited it heh... The idiot was so tyco today... he kept hitting the cock onto the line... Anyway after that pple like me who failed NAFTA have to go for training... After runnin 2 rounds ard the track in 3.30 minutes we had to do 20 tuck jumps then do this lunging thing across the field. Insane I tell u... Later my legs were like so numb I just collapsed when I tried to get up from the bleachers...   Following which was recess after which was a whole row of lectures. We had this double maths lecture period, and since Keith Tan's temporary replacement teacher was this slack, blur guy the entire LT started doing their own homework. Guess what? The school admin -just- had to have their fire drill then! So we wasted about 1 period just standing in the field and listening to the DM and Principal talk. Gah. For PW period later, Keith Tan took charge of our class, though he only came in for like 15 minutes or so. Gosh he rocks! Our ST, Ms Roberta Tan, tries her best but she's a PE teacher and thus is out of touch with all the acad stuff... But Keith Tan knows everything! Lucky SB1 to have him as a CT. Anyway PW was kinda stressful for our group... Coz there's this guy called Karno in our group and he's the unofficial group leader. He was kinda pushing everyone super hard, especially me since he was this mindset that I'm always lazy and I'm always slacking. Sighz...   Ah yes. The double chinese period that capped the day. It was extremely enjoyable! The chinese department invited some members of ARK Music school to come and do some performance... So they basically took dedications and played it if they could. Was real cool... The performers consisted of 4 people, 1 gurl and 3 guys. One guy was the pianist, another the guitarist, and the rest were vocals. They were actually quite good, being able to perform the songs quite accurately. Haha one gurl in my class dedicated the song to her 'husband', another gurl. Lol naturally it caused quite some stir in the LT in which they performed. During the performance I decided to sit next to DL to ask him about his medical checkup. Apparently there might be some complications... Well Bryan Chua, the unofficial class outkast, decided to sit on the other side of DL. I realized I couldn't stop feeling disgusted about Bryan. Its quite obvious that Bryan Chua was sitting there coz DL was most probably the only person around who would talk to him.&nbsp; DL's the kind who would never snub anyone. Yet I felt extremely guilty and ashamed at feeling that way. I mean, wif the prayer group and stuff, I'm supposed to be an example to others, a 'reflector' of God's love. Yet I let myself be subjected to such feelings of repulsion and discrimination.&nbsp;Even thou Bryan&nbsp;-is- such a irritating guy and all he's still a son of God and thus I should...&nbsp;be nice to him? Gosh its so hard... During PW&nbsp;period Bryan's group&nbsp;leader&nbsp;was buring his face in his hands and&nbsp;Gareth was like engaging in this shouting match with&nbsp;Bryan.&nbsp;Like&nbsp;Gareth is normally a guy with a&nbsp;quiet, calm demeanour.&nbsp;Furthermore Bryan&nbsp;tore up like his annotated articles,&nbsp;for no discernable reason other than he felt they were irrelavant (they weren't). Later during lunch he complained to everyone &nbsp;that his group was discriminating against him... *bogglez* He's just a real pain in the ass like... all the time! Its like so hard to be like DL, to treat everyone well... Nvm that shall be my new target. 'Thou shalt love Bryan Chua'. Haha Gareth s'ry for koking your nick :P   Now I'm just rushing PW. The deadline for the handing in of the GPF is tml, 1630 hrs at the PW room. Failure to do so before then will result in penalies imposed. Gah. So I'm rushing to compile and evaluate the survey results. Eek... So much to do, so little time.

      It was raining heavily this morning. To those lucky people who have adoring parents to send them to school, that dosen't mean much. To me thou, it&nbsp;spells out one simple word - Trouble. As expected, it was. I had to use my umbrella&nbsp;when walking from my house to the mrt, then again when I was walking from the mrt to ACJC. In the end, my bag and shoes were still soaked. Still... Wad to do... My parents dun want to fetch me. I can't blame them I guess... Its too much to expect them to send me there and back every morning. It costs about 5 dollars in fuel costs, not to mention the opportunity cost that my father would have to bear should be fetch me to school. :P Econs...   Ah well. Enuff&nbsp;complaining. Today was racial harmony day, which resulted in us attending some hanee painting session for our PCCG period. It was quite&nbsp;useful - I was sleeping. The poor indian gurl in my class was getting teased by our class in the name of 'racial harmony'. We took that to mean racial tolerance, and thus theorized that she should take no offence from our jokes, and instead laugh along with them :P The only bad event today was the first period, economics. Ms Rahimah was extremely pissed coz our entire class had no idea wad equilibrium output was. I must say I was kinda guilty of stoning during her lectures and thus having no idea as to wad that was supposed to mean. Then again I was just confused wif all the complicated terms that she seems to be in no lack of. Like I seriously need to start mugging... Promos are only, what, 10 wks away? I'm still playing basketball, playing Allegiance, sleeping during lectures and tutorials and basically just stoning. Dunno what's happened lately... I dun even feel a -bit- of nervousness or concern for the promos. Yet I know, somewhere in the back of my mind, how important the promos are to not only my jc years, but the rest of my life.   When the final bell finally rang, I took off for the school gates and rushed to tjc. My main reason going there was to, of course, support the ACJC debate team as they took on VJC in the semi finals. Taking mrt, I still reached there at 3pm, 1 hour early. There, I met Mr Ngoei in the canteen, where he made me sign some consent form for the debate supporters. After which I went to find my mom to pass her some stuff. For those who dunno my mom's the physics head of tjc :P Sounds so ego rite? No lar see my physics scores and u know lar... She'll kill me when she finds out. Then I just bummed ard wif Mr Ngoei until the debate started. Just before that, the 'supporters' from the ACJC debate finally came. It consisted of Ben T, President, Sarah, Vice President, and 3 other members. The motion of the debate was 'The Olympics is a waste of resources'. ACJC was the proposition and VJC, the opposition. Even to my untrained ear, I could see that VJC basically screwed up their case. They did not engage the proposition on their terms and spent too long giving flimsy rebuttals and thus had too little time to give their substantive points. They also thought that cricket was an olympic sport and that gymnastics did not enjoy&nbsp;substantial&nbsp;viewership. Heh but ACJC made some mistakes of their own too I guess... Just that I obviously couldn't remember them :P   After the debate ended, with ACJC winning and the VJC second speaker getting best speaker. When the debate ended I went down to the canteen and met some gurl from the council interns thingy in TPJC. Heh I couldn't remember her name though :P Anyway I just sat down and chatted wif her... After a while some of her friends came and I found out that one of them, Elizabeth Soh, was from my adjacent class in primary school. Apparently she was also childhood friends wif my present classmate and good friend, Russell Ang. She's also the classmate of my ex-neighbour. Talk about concidence. As we were chatting Lucas and Kitson walked by with their respective teams... Poor Lucas... He looked positively disappointed. After all HCJC were the favourites to win that debate, considering its relatively good track record. Surprise! Ga Yeong came by and said hullo. Dunno how she recognized me lol... Its been quite a while since we met... Kah hong was right - she has changed alot... She was wearing some sparkling two piece suit... Think its supposed to be malaysian or smthing... In any case she looked stunning :)&nbsp;After a while&nbsp;Azimah -finally- came out from her MCS meeting, wearing a white malay dress and sporting the funny band that u get from donating blood... Haven't seen her in quite a while but evidently she still as vertically challenged as ever :P Muahahaha I'm so evvvvil. Heh&nbsp;anyway we walked to Bedok mrt, where I took&nbsp;the train home yup. I realize I still miss all my TPJC friends even thou its been like 4 months since we split up... There's apparently this TPJC chinese cultural night this friday... Dunno whether I should go. Anyone interested tell mi k?

      The morning that greeted me as I crawled out of bed was cool and quiet.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like sooooooo comfortable. I had half a mind to sleep in, pon school, and&nbsp;get an MC later for 4 dollars. Ah well. My mom's screaming voice yelling at me to get up changed my mind. Later on the MRT trip to school, I was so tired that I overslept till Dover. At least I still made it to school on time, thank God.  &nbsp; School was surprisingly fairly enjoyable today... Even PE. I think my PE teacher gave up or something... He's the guy who just came back from Pulau Tekong army camp. At first he was rather entu, making unfit pple like me run rounds around the track. Hah but I think he met his match in my class. My class should be given some tag, like 'The Demoralizer'. My class can really suck the inspiration, the drive, the morale from someone. Like my poor PE teacher. Today he just made us do some rugby training which was supposed called 'suicide'. It kinda resembles shuttle run. Supposedly the ruggers do it at the end of their training, hence the name. And after that? He just let us go with this huge sigh. Lol. Oh after PE me and russell went to play basketball with some SB7 pple. It was Russell, Ian and me against Alvin (the SB7 one) and 4 other SB7 gurls. Rofl. As u can expect it was more or less a trashing :P There was one part when this gurl was gonna take a shot. Just for fun, I just took a step towards her and raised my hand to my head level. Guess what? I actually rejected the ball. Like she shot straight into my hand. Lol. Then she started saying it was so unfair, and then we weren't allowed to reject when the gurls shot. This reeks of sexism I tell u. Gurls should be given the honour of getting rejected by me :P &nbsp; GP test was the last event of the day. For the uninformed, the GP test consists of about 40-50 fill-in-the-blank questions which come from this 'Reading Package', which is basically a collection of newspaper articles. Most people, especially muggers, will highlight and annotate the entire reading package till it looks like some kinda messy art drawing. As for me I only start reading the package when I enter the exam hall. Yet I seem to score like 45/50 for those tests. Interesting rite? Its called speed reading. Anyway&nbsp;today I did basically the same thing, unfortunately there was a whole bunch of UN questions which I had no idea how to answer. The reason for this was that the UN questions came from this article about 'Just War', but since I naturally looked in the UN related articles for it, I could not find it. Gah. &nbsp; Ah well... Now back to work and more work. Life seems to be saturated with that dreadful word - work. Kinda reminds me of this joke I heard last time. There was this newly-married bride who tearfully called her mom and complained about her husband. She said 'Mom! One week into the marraige and James starts using all those terrible 4-Letter words on me!' Fearing the worst the mom asked, 'What words?' 'Iron, Wash, Work and Cook!' the daughter replied :P Heh... that was a temporary spark in my otherwise boring and monotonous life. Back to work!

      Today was the 29th Student Council's Investiture. Amid great fanfare, the colours and the 28th councillors walked into the hall in orderly and definitely impressive fashion. After a comparitively quick service it was the turn of the new 29th councillors to pledge their allegiance to the school and then escort the ex-councillors as they walked out of the hall. Quite a few councillors and teachers were seen crying, most notably the discipline master himself, especially since he was on the pulpit and the sound of his not-so-subtle tearing was audible to the entire hall. Ah well.&nbsp; Even grown men cry. &nbsp; Sitting there I could not help but feel a tinge of sadness as I saw my friends from secondary school like Plock go up and receive the councillor colours... Just realized how everyone, in GEP at least, seems to be achieving so much, going so many places, and I'm just languishing in my sad class, drowning in my lazyiness... What my GP teacher said on the first day in school suddenly struck me - she said that a sizable percentage of GEPs end up being social outcasts and do bad academically when they go to JC. That kinda describes my situation now... I dun exactly like my class, and my academic results can't exactly be said to be good either. For those who dunch noe, I got DDEF. Every year I make a promise to my self to work harder, to prove my abilities to my peers, my parents, my teachers and most importantly myself. I dun see how GEPs are suppposed to be so smart and all - I'm a good example.  &nbsp; Sad things aside, I had econs debate today! The motion was 'Both the consumers and economy will benefit from an expansion of firms.' I was the 3rd speaker of the opposition. Truth be told, neither side prepared at all. Furthermore, only half my team was present. Thus, we only had 2 out of the minimum 4. I was hoping that the debate would be postponed. Alas, Rahimah simply selected Rebecca to take the 2nd speaker slot. Each speaker was supposed to be given 5 minutes to speak, but since we did not prepare at all, every speaker was averaging 2 minutes max, except me, at 4 and a half minutes. The reason why I took so long was that I was, to put it bluntly, bullshitting all the way. That, and rebutting all their points. The end result was me throwing basically their entire case out of the window. For example, they stated that with a firm's expansion the firm would incur cost savings, which would&nbsp;thus benefit customers. I&nbsp;retaliated,&nbsp;giving the example of microsoft, which&nbsp;produces at a huge scale, yet charges alot for its products. That, and other case examples garnered me the title of best speaker :P Before all your congraulations start coming in, I must admit that it was bascially a fluke... I was easily the only person in both teams who had any debating experience. Unfortunately the propostition won, which puzzled me as we had twice as many valid points as they did... Ah well. One can't get everything in life. &nbsp; Oh that reminds me. Today's&nbsp;message was about being a T.T.T.T. that stands for 'The two talent team'. I can't rmb exactly wad its supposed to mean, but the speaker, Rev. Huang from Barker Road Methodist Church, gave a rather good story which reminded me not to be greedy in life. In the story there was this college lecturer, a friend of a certain pastor called Tony.&nbsp; One day the college lecturer quit his job and became a mailman. At the request of the lecturer's distraught mom, Tony went to visit the lecturer. Apparently his friend was now the worst mailman of all - when others finished their rounds by 2 pm, he finished his by 5. The reason was that he would visit many people along his route. Thou Tony's friend had taken a huge step down the social ladder by becoming a mailman, he had gained much more than material success could ever bring. Sounds cliche rite? Sometimes u just need something like that to shock u into reality.

      Just came back from the International Student Symposium organized by the Singapore International Foundation (SIF). To sum it all in one word, it was BORING. That pretty much describes it. Most of us who went there expected at least some kinda group discussion like Pre U sem... Unfortunately the only thing we got were panel discussions, panel discussions and more panel discussions. Oh yes and plenty of tea breaks. A simplified example of today's programme:  9 am: Registration 10 am: Welcome and Keynote address 11.10 am: Tea Break 11.30 am: Plenary Session 1.30 pm: Lunch 3.00 pm: Discussion Session 4.30 pm: Finish  Both the Plenary Session and the Discussion Session turned out to be panel discussions... As such the 'delegates', as we are called, have to be seated for hours on end listening to sometimes boring speeches and then the consecutive Q & A sessions. The theme for this Symposium is 'Global challenges &amp; their impact on Asia's revival.' The topic's quite interesting and current, which was why most of us went in the first place... Ponning school isn't much of a reason... Especially for me. I'm missing my slackest day in the week and the Nday celebrations. Bleargh. For the Plenary Session most of the ACJC representives were either doing homework or doodling... As for Michelle and Wei Liang... *grinz* You know what.  During lunch we split into 2 tables, the scones and the non-scones (so antisocial right?) Oliver Loke's friend, this AC guy 5 years our senior who is studying in Oxford, came to sit with us... Gave us some insight on Uni life... Quite enlightening... Joanna's RJC friend Stephanie came too... Only 2 pple from RJC had come. I had the misfortune of sitting between Joanna and Natasha, coz they kept switching plates... Somehow they seemed to have complementary tastes... Between them they ate pretty much everything... Except the greens. Oh yes... The greens! The tea break wasn't so bad... But the lunch was horrible! Our lunch consisted of 3 courses: Some super healthy salad, a small portion of chicken chop with potato and finally tiramisu cake. The salad was composed almost entirely of green leafy veggies... Disgusting. Only Shaun seemed to be enjoying it... The chicken chop was of quite a small portion... Thou it was strangely filling. Mmm maybe coz Joanna gave me half of her's :P For those who're starting to grin, she just dumped it on my plate k? I'm not a glutton *ahem*. As for the tiramisu it was quite ok... Then again voguish Joanna found it 'too powdery'. See lar too much good food...  For the following discussion session we were split according to our topics of interest... Most of the ACJC representives chose the Media topic, so only Joanna, Oliver and me were in group 2: Social Consequences of Econimic Success: Tackling the Issues at Hand. Somehow Oliver wasn't there so it was just the 2 of us... There were 2 speakers, one guy from some green movement, the other the Assistant Editor of The Business Times. What they said was quite... Expected. I have a feeling we learnt all this in Secondary Sch Social Studies or something... The Q &amp; A session was quite ok. There was one part though when this Indonesian Uni Student, speaking in halting English, asked the speakers what he should do to reform his corrupt country. Yes, corrupt. I could almost hear the audience in the boardroom wince when he described Indonesia as 'Corrupt, and with a messed up economy'. Anyway he sounded really sincere... Kinda sad...  In conclusion, (this is starting to sound like a GP essay), the first day of the session... Was quite disappointing I guess. One of the main, stated, purpose of this symposium was to let the young Asean generation meet, interact and network. This, I believed, would be achieved through group discussions... But the only thing they had were panel discussions... Which are almost useless for giving us a chance to meet students of the international community. Ah well. It remains to be seen how good tml's session will be.

      Tuesday was rather slack and uneventful, except for the Econs Test. It was actually quite easy... Most probably since there wasn't any essay. It was just mcq and drq... Unfortunately I was rather tired and I just slept thru half the test! I remember doing my mcq halfway, then suddenly waking up about 40 minutes later... Haha dun worry I still finished it :P As for the chem prac before that... We did our first organic chem practical... It was some complex thingy that involved making an ester from phenol... A substance that's supposedly rather harmful to human skin... So we're supposed to be very careful with it... Well Kevin See just had to spill his on my notepad... But strangely it didn't burn the paper... Interesting! After school I had d/c, after which I went to practice wed morning's worship with Yong Ming and Terence... Haha Terence and me finally managed to persuade Yong Ming to not play 'Reflector'... For those who dunno, 'Reflector' is this really fast paced hard to play and hard to sing song... That's the problem when u're from City Harvest... You honestly think 'All things are possible', without any care of whether the project is realistic. No offence to any harvesters ard :P  As for today I woke up at 0530! Luckily I slept at 9 pm the earlier night so I didn't feel too tired... Anyway I rushed to school and managed to reach there, taking mrt, by 0635... But Yong ming didn't come till 0655! The idiot told me to come at 0630... Bah. Anyway so I just bummed ard and talked to Cuz... Poor gurl... She's working so hard yet she's not doing well... When Yong ming came we practiced a while then had our worship... It was quite ok, according to most pple, except that they felt I was playing too fast... Heh I'm s'ry to all who had to sing super fast to catch up with my playing! What happened was that my guitar strap was falling off my shoulder, and so I was playing quickly so that we could change song and I could... Adjust the strap yup... Ah well there were naturally abit of cock-ups during worship but not much problem... Later Ben and me were supposed to make some super lame announcement for the CF August Bday bash... We were supposed to go on stage and have this dialogue:  'Hi Alvin.' 'Hi Ben.' 'Do you know its my bday this month?' *bish* 'Why did you bash me for?' 'Coz the cf is having a bday bash this month.'  Lame right? Haha but Sandra Gwee said we shouldn't make such an announcment... So we didn't. The rest of the day was really rather boring... I was sleeping during class... After school there was the meeting for participants of the International Student Symposium... About two-thirds of the people going are sconers... That mean anything to u? Well it does to me... A further example of scone dominance! Scone refers to Sc1 btw, supposedly the top science class in ACJC. Anyway after the meeting I met Peter. He was waiting for Adeline and *ahem* to finish their essay writing competition, so I just bummed ard wif him... He's so much more approachable now... Time just flew by as I was talking to him... Oh I scolded him thou. The idiot decided to drop a few drops of phenol on the back of his palm just to 'see if it hurts'. So now it has 3 burn marks... Talk about stupidity.  Later I met Zhi and got a lift from him home, but ended up staying quite a while at his house planning the Sunday Prayer Group worship... The original arrangement was for him to play lead and me to play support, but apparently he found that I was 'too pro' and so I'll be the only one playing, unless he can 'play as well as me' before Sunday... Rofl. No confidence sia... Oh well. I'm still super tired... Need to go and sleeeep... Just did research for econs and gp presentations... Which are due tml. Lol I'm like such a last minute guy...

      Haha I forgot all about the interesting events! Yes... Today nothing much happened lar... Except just after recess... Shaun, Stella and me were in the canteen walking towards lt1... Stella just had to push me for fun... I banged into this guy and his entire cup of iced milo spilled onto the ground... Lol. Stella kept saying sorry haha... In the end I paid the guy for the drink... Lucky he was Shaun's ncc senior, or I dunno wad he'll do... He's this humongous guy...  Today some Bone Marrow Registry came to our school seeking Bone Marrow Donors... I decided to sign up, along with Russell, Sonia and some members of Sb1 like Eugene and zk. Zhi actually turned up at the hub, but he spent 15 minutes of Chinese period 'deciding'... Well in the end he was too scared of the thing and so he didn't sign up... Thus ponning 15 minutes of Chinese period. Tsk tsk... As for Neha she did sign up, but she was like so scared she was running around the place... As for the ever sadistic Eugene he was trying to scare her by telling her all the horror stories... As Sonia says 'Bad Boy!' :P After filling up this form we simply go to this table where this person will prick your finger, then wipe your blood over this black circle printed on some filter paper-like material. Before me was Lifeng and her's went without a hitch... As for mine... Bahaha. Guess what? My blood clotted. And so the poor Nurse had to prick another hole! This time she did it diagonally, so it would resemble more of slit... Even then the blood still took so long to flow out haha... Having Russell next to me and laughing his lungs out didn't help :P Of course we were late for econs later, but for once Rahimah didn't seem to care. Lol. The double period saw our class getting scolded again, coz we couldn't understand this diagram... Ah well.  After school ended, I left for East point to go for my dental appointment... Somehow I got some rather big cavity and I have to fill it up before the bacteria burrows to my nerve... Bleargh... To think that it would happen to me... It turned out my rushing was of no use... The dentist was delayed for half an hour, so I browsed around the place and ended up buying a cd for my mom (its her bday today!) and a gift for Sonia (its her bday tml!) During the filling of my teeth I was actually quite scared... For some strange reason the entire area around my tooth felt numb, and the dentist seemed to be doing all kinds of weird things to my teeth... At one point she dropped a few drops of a strange smelling liquid from this bottle that had the flammable logo, then used the strange 'light gun' on her rack... I've never seen her use it before today, but it bears the radiation warning thingy... Anyway it kinda freaked me out coz like it makes this guzzling sound when in operation, and emits a green glow... Also there was this intense yellow light just at the bottom of my vision which reminded me of a camping gas stove... I thought she was burning some thing on my tooth or something... Felt really scared then... Anyway it turned out fine in the end... Praise the Lord!  Oh yeah something's worrying me... I'm recently feeling very lethargic... The last 4 periods I couldn't concentrate on anything... Since I reached home I've been feeling... Bored? Useless? Tired? Dazed? I dunno. Furthermore there's Econs test tml... On 2 major topics: Production and Costs and Market Structure. Bleargh.

      This past week, especially the last 2 days, has provided much food for thought for me... Firstly, the recent chinese homework on the theme of filial piety has made me reflect on how I treat my parents... Those who know me may actually start puking that I'm actually taking chinese homework seriously for once, but I was just looking at how hard my parents, especially my mom, are working to keep our family together in such tough times and I feel really lucky in a sense... Though we maybe in lack of material prosperity, I still think I prefer my family to those wealty, yet broken families that are so common around us.  Another important aspect to reflect on is that of being a Christian... Anyone remember the book 'In his steps?' It's quite a touching story about how the First Church in a fictional town called Raymond got transformed from a snobbish rich church to one that truely wanted to follow in Jesus's steps. The church members, risking their stellar reputations, asked themselves what Jesus would do in their place and then went on to do it. The result of course was disastrous for their status among men, and some got killed or gravely harmed in the process... Others abandoned brilliant careers and the admiration of men to gain the favour of God. Kinda made me wonder if we're really walking 'In his steps'... Everytime we sing the song 'To the ends of the Earth', how many of us actually mean it? Most probably none... Its a real hard thing to do... I got this friend whose hesistant about going to church coz she thinks most church going Christians are hypocrites. Fact is I do know of some people who are... Sunday Christians? Yanno on Sunday they're all holy and all... But as for the rest of the week, once they step out of the sacred sanctuary of the church they become a completely different person... I can't say I'm not guilty of that, so its something to work towards...  Anyone who serves in the music ministry should also be able to sympathize with my problem... I feel as if I'm playing for men, not for God... Guitar was God's gift to me, and even though I'm not good at it I know I should still give all glory to him... Unfortunately I find that I sometimes care too much about the music, about the impression I'm making on others, about the melody of the songs that I don't care about whether everyone is praising God from our heart... Last sunday there was an article in the Methodist message titled 'Feeding sheep or amusing goats'. It was about how the church today seemed so obsessed with providing entertainment to the masses in the hope that more will come to Christ. It proposed that the church refocused its priorities to the spreading of God's word... 'Jesus pitied sinners, sighed and wept over them, but never sought to amuse them.' Dun get me wrong, I'm not saying Hillsongs is wrong, but one must remember which is the 'means' and which is the 'ends'. At least 'Heart of worship' always serves to remind me of what I should be doing... Just hope I follow it. Oh yea... Pastor Louis, in last Sunday's sermon, gave a short blistering lecture targeted at the Church's youth... Basically he was saying that alot of us come to church sometimes because we have to, its a ritual, to see friends or simply to pass the time... Which kinda defeats the purpose of going to church. Sitting in the pews I couldn't help realizing how true that is... Sometimes I come to church simply coz pple bug me to, simply coz... I dun want to spend my entire sunday at home.  Today's devotions by Mrs Rosalind Tan was about the story of Joseph and his brothers... For those who found the devotion quite fragmented and confusing, it was because Mrs Tan had only half the time she had expected to have, thanks to Brian and the worship team :P So yeah she rushed thru 7 pages worth of the stuff in a mere 15 minutes or so. Anyway, her intended message was about authority and Jesus's sacrifice for us, but I saw a more imporant message, especially important to my family, which is to trust God with everything... It was Joseph's faith in God that allowed him to rise from a slave to become what literally was the PM of Egypt. Its so hard to do it sometimes, but when one actually dedicates and commits his or her entire life to God, him or her also frees himself from all his burdens gives them to God... Yup. Heh something tells me I'm rambling... So yeaps. Some food for thought.

      Ok... Something is wrong... After making me go offline my mom continued her ranting... She like just threw all my stuff on the floor... Gosh I never knew she had such strength... She's now bitchin at everyone else even thou its the next day... Scolding everyone in the house... And I have no idea why. Maybe she has PMS? Well at least she left for Church... So I have peace and quiet at home... Until I go for 2nd service later.  I'm now addicted to Planetshakers! Well not exactly addicted, but well I like their sound. I believe its appropiate for the Passion ACJC thingy the cf comm is organizing for the end of the year... For those who are uninformed its this FOP-like event with ACJC students performing... Mostly it'll be open to ACJC... Of course others would be welcome... Should be around November... But first the project should get off the ground :P 'I wanna be a reflector, I wanna shine in your glory...' Haha the bass is surely shaking the study room... Being home alone means I can turn the sound louder than normal... As for secular music... My new favourite band is Michael learns to rock... They rose to prominence a few years ago I think... Then faded from the limelight. Well their music still rocks... Its like... soft pop? I dunno wad u call it... Anyway try out 'Blue Night' and 'The Actor'. The lyrics are quite meaningful too... Oh btw if u listen to 'Take me to your heart' u'll realize it sounds like a certain very popular Andy Lau song... Like its almost a direct translation :)  Ah well. Enuff about music matters... I've recently been reflecting about relationships and love... Coz I have this good friend... He's a real popular guy with many gurls liking him... Yet strangely the one gurl he likes, can't be with him. She's shunning him coz her good friend also likes him... Being the good gurl she is, she'll rather sacrifice her love (if there is), then antagonize her friend. It's made further complicated by the presense of a third gurl, good friends of the other 2. She likes my friend alot, unlike the 2nd gurl, who my friend thinks is just a crush.  This 3rd gurl is a really really nice gurl... There's another guy chasing her but its kinda obvious she likes my friend... Yesterday that guy and her just made their relationship official... Yet she so obviously still yearns for my friend. My friend's fretting and for once I find that I can't give much meaningful advice anymore... Then there's also the aspect of God... My friend's been praying all the while, but I wonder if he's doing it wrongly. Lately the message I seem to be getting from God is to... Commit everything to him, be it a simple meal to a relationship. I told my friend and he promised to try it. Hope it works. Sometimes... A relationship isn't meant to be, or its meant to be started at a later time, not now. I got this book on dating given by my ex cell leader... In it there was this case example of 2 people who were in love, but one was committed to law while the other to being a missionary. As a result they seperated... Years later they met in Africa as the one who wanted to become a lawyer felt God's calling asking her to be a missionary. Thus they restarted the relationship and of course 'lived happily ever after'. Ah well. Makes for some good food for thought.
