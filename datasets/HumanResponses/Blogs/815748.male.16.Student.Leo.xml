       Here is the first posting of Al's Picks, a list of my top choices in a variety of subjects, ALong with related commentary:  �My favorite book is "Ender's Game" by Orson Scott Card. It follows a young boy with a brilliant strategic mind as he trains for war against an aggressive ALien species in a Battle School. I especially admire the theme of games throughout the book (the literary device is used wonderfully), the plot twists, and the story in generAL. I highly recommend it, as well as the rest of the series and other books by the author, including "The Worthing Saga." Hatrack.com.  �My favorite movie is "GoldenEye" of the James Bond series. Bond, a secret agent for British Intelligence, works to thwart a diabolicAL plot to destroy London. Amazing storytelling, acting, music, plot� just plain cool. You MUST see this movie. I feel guilty though, because when I exposed my friend Matt to it, he became obsessed with the series (that includes the old ones, which aren't that good for the most part), irrevocably changing the course of human history forever. Besides that, I would recommend the next two movies of the series, "Tomorrow Never Dies" and "The World Is Not Enough." I am also rapt with anticipation of the newest one, "Die Another Day." Jamesbond.com.     Furthermore, I enjoyed such films as "George Lucas in Love," a ten-minute parody of "Star Wars" and "Shakespeare in Love" which my cousin did the music for; "Princess Mononoke,"  a great anime epic; "Star Trek Six: The Undiscovered Country," which ALudes to some famous historicAL events, if you're well-read and quick enough to catch them; "The Mummy," the new version with some awesome action, speciAL effects, and comedy; "Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones" which was wonderful, but, like the last one, had its ups and downs; and "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" and "Austin Powers in Goldmember," a pair of hilarious James Bond spoofs. From this long entry, it's clear that I'm avid for films, having co-founded the Newton Film Society a.k.a. Springtime for Hitler, which has but three members.  �My favorite comic strip is FoxTrot. It is ordinarily extraordinarily funny, and its main character, Jason Fox, shares an unusuAL magnitude of traits with my friend Jonny.  �I am not sure what my favorite song is. Top contenders include, not in order of favoritism, "Rhapsody in Blue" by George Gershwin, "Eleanor Rigby" by the Beatles, "I Feel The Earth Move" by Carole King, "GoldenEye" by Tina Turner, "Pretty Fly For A Rabbi" by Weird Al Yankovich, "Star Wars Gangsta Rap" by Bentframe, and "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen.  �My favorite subject is social studies. History for some reason intrigues me, with tales of mighty empires of ages long past and the struggle to become the dominant nation on the planet. This may change, however, if my class and/or in the coming year turns out to be terribAL.  �My favorite modern country is Canada. Why, you ask? Canada never hurt anybody. Other contenders include Switzerland, AustrALia, and Japan, for neutrALity, accent and attitude, and technological advancements, respectively.  �My favorite historicAL figure is, I think, Alexander the Great. Not only does he share in the prominence of having the same name as someone like me, but he wasn't a bad conqueror or dictator either.  �My favorite car is the Jaguar X-Type. This British-made beauty is amazingly stylish.  �My favorite television program is The Simpsons. AL I can say is wow. And ha!  So ends this instALlment of Al's Picks. Stay tuned for updates to this column (but they might be annuAL, so don't hold your breath).

       I am (about to be) a freshman at North. I'll post my classes when I get my schedule, which should arrive any day now. Right now I can't wait for school to start (yeah, I know, it sounds awfully nerdish, but education has the potentiAL to be fun, and more intensive social interaction ALmost never fails to delight). I may regret my words in a month or two, but optimism never hurt anyone, with the possible exception of Candide (character in a Voltaire book, easy to read, but the action moves too fast to get a good stable novel). Until then, I'm savoring AL of the benefits of my lethargy, which I certainly will miss once school rolls around.  I'm Jewish (and proud of it), and am now considered a man under Jewish law having ALready undergone my Bar Mitzvah. So why can't I see R-rated movies without an adult, drive, vote, or have a job without a work permit? Blatant ageism, that's why. (This is actuALly only part of my politicAL views on the subject, I'll explain more later.) I encourage everyone to embrace their Jewish heritage, even if they're not even remotely Semitic.   Le Chaim (to life)!

       Welcome to The AL Blog, where AL can ALccess AL Al-related ALformation. Al hopes Al'll enjoy it. Note: this is simply a preALmptory post; the next morsALs of ALformation will actuALly give AL what AL wants to know. By the way, this is moderately ALvanced Allish (the language of the Allish-speaking peoples) AL is speaking; the most ALvanced stuff can only be ALnderstood by two people. AL won't neccesALrily speak in Allish, at least not ALvanced Allish. For the first time, this is AL, signing off.

       I'm back! Sorry I didn't post this earlier; I didn't have time in the Cyber Cafe and Blogger keeps deleting what I type. Anyway, here's my assessment of the port of Canada (MontreAL).  The Museum of Contemporary Art was just plain weird. The exhibit I went to, by Janet Cardiff, was an audio wALkthrough of the Villa Medici in Rome. Next time, I'd rather something more traditionAL.  Space Station 3D was pretty cool, except that there wasn't any reference point to enhance the 3D experience and Tom Cruise, the narrator, is a little full of himself. Still, the generAL movie, the 3Dness of it, and the space videography are definitely worth seeing.  The Notre Dame Basilica, near the Museum des Sciences de MontreAL (where Space Station 3D was playing), had amazing architecture. It was obvious at that point that MontreAL was trying to be a mini-Paris. Even so, if you're ever in MontreAL, you should stop by.  The Parc Olympique was ok. The stadium looked awesome (http://www.rio.gouv.qc.ca/images/imgfra/anno.gif, it's in the black ring), and the view from the top of the tower connected to it was breathtaking but predictable. The Biodome, with 4 different ecosystems, had some quaint creatures, like penguins and a tamarin. The BotanicAL Gardens had some very exotic flora, but I'm not reALly a plant person. Sure, if you're in the city, go to the Olympic Park, but I would skip the flowers.  In conclusion, MontreAL is ok for a visit, but Boston is far superior.

       High school has officiALly begun! It seems a lot like Day, actuALly. I have ok teachers, for the most part, and the homework level is the same (of course, it has only been two days). Some of the homework I actuALly liked! Mr. Nocera, my science teacher, is reALly cool in a 70s kind of way. His homework is reALly easy; I showed it to Jonny's little brother and he said that's the kind of thing he did two years ago! I'm proud of two English assignments I've done, one about seeing "Austin Powers in Goldmember" and one where I had to draw an abstract self-portrait. Ask me if you want to see them. The math was pretty fun, though I forgot a concept we learned last year, which partially impeded my homework. Even so, school so far has been pretty fun.

       School starts in 41 1/4 hours! Aaaaaaaaaah! I am excited to see what AL of my classes have in store, but I miss the summer dormancy scheduAL. To lighten the stress of school, I just finished reading Sean Covey's The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens, patterned after his father's The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, which Jason (Jr. Olympic Gymnast and neighbor, also known as The Incredible Bulk) gave to me for my Bar Mitzvah but which I got bored of reading and so switched to this. I recommend it. I'm also anticipating the new oppurtunities that will be open to me in high school, including but not limited to better access to Newtonville and a couple of my friends' houses. Look at the post below for more.

       Hi everyone! Check out Loren's blog at http://mandyell.blogspot.com/. He stole the idea of a blog from me, but I stole this idea from him:  Here's my list of classes, organized like so: Name�Semesters Taught�First Period Each Week (who else I am reasonably sure is in it). See if you're in any of them, and let me know if you aren't already listed.  Freshman Core P E�1�G2 (Matt) Freshman Core P E�2�B2 (Loren) Sexuality and Health�2�B1 (no one I know) English 9 I�1/2�C1 (Loren) Speech�1�B1 (Dan Waldinger) French 2 I�1/2�A1 (Richie, John Garabedian, Ian, Josh Magid) World History 300-1815 I�1/2�D1 (Loren) Mock Trials�1/2�M5 (no one I know) Model U.N.�2�M5 (Matt) Honors Math 1�1/2�F1 (Richie) Intro Physics Lab�1/2�E1 (Alex Turner, Simon)  I'm in homeroom 210A, also.  Tell me if you match any!

       Ok, here are my updates:  1) I thought I would like history best this year, but math has pulled into the lead. Why, you ask? Because I understand AL of the concepts taught in math (even though it's honors), and my history teacher knows nothing about history, compared to me, at least.  2) I'm going to get a pocket constitution tomorrow. I lost the one I got last year, and I want to be able to effectively argue with my teachers about my rights.  3) I fasted for Yom Kippur (or Yom Ki-per, as some pronounce it), and I did one of the haftarah ALiyot, of which I am proud.  4) For some reason, while Loren and I were wALking to lunch one day, an upperclassman picked him up and temporarily carried him off. Afterward, I said a trio of hilarious comments about the situation, including "In the future, try not to get carried away," "You sure got swept off your feet," and "I've been picked up before, but never like that." One word. Well, three kind of. LOL!

       I recently conceived of two new inventions.  One, which I thought of with Jonny's help, is an ultra-smALl computer with an ultra-large screen (which takes up virtuALly no space and has virtuALly no mass or dimensions), and a full-size keyboard*.  Two, which I thought of independently, is a compact ergonomic combination pen (with multiple colors of ink), pencil, and eraser*. I'm ALso trying to work in a white-out dispenser.  *I will not elaborate due to the current state of my patents (non-existent).

       I'm updating this early. My policy is to update whenever Loren updates his, but he hasn't for a while, and for AL I know, his policy is to update whenever I update mine. Anyway, here it is:  Have you seen or heard of the movie "Sweet Home Alabama"? It looks reALly stupid, but when translated into contemporary Allish (in which whenever there is an "a" or an "l" you add an "l" or an "a", respectively, so that it becomes Al) it reads "Sweet Home ALALALBALMAL"!  I hear "The Tuxedo" is out. I have plenty of people who I could see it with, but I don't know who I should invite. If anyone reading this blog wants to go, tell me.  It's officiAL: My least favorite class is French. My teacher is reALly evil and a little... off. I can't wait until next year when I don't have to have her anymore.  I got my pocket Constitution! It's reALly cool, and I can whack people with it! Go Republic (that statement does not imply my support of this government, this Administration, AL of our laws, AL of those rednecks, or AL of those stupid, commercialist, naive, Republican, or New-Agey people)!

       Today was the day of campaign speeches!   As my second-to-last blog indicates, I am running for Student Faculty Administration. My speech (written at 10:30 last night) was pretty good. I tALked about how students shouldn't just vote for their friends or for someone with an amusing campaign gimmick, that I support the pluses and minuses grading system, that locker graffiti is an important part of the school's culture, and that random locker searches are unconstitutionAL. I ended with saying that I would protect your liberties as students, then "My name is Alexander Dietz, and I'm running for Student Faculty Administration!" something I 'borrowed' from The West Wing.  I think the speech was generally well-received. In contrast to others, I actuALly DELVED into the issues, and not just praised myself. Afterward, many people I would not have thought would vote for me said they would. Whadayaknow.  In closing, Alexander Dietz for Student Faculty Administration. Intelligent leadership for your school.

       Well, I went to the first meeting of Model U.N. It was ok, but a little rowdy and confusing. I don't think I'll do it for more than one term. I just checked my schedule, and it turns out I'm signed up for it as a class next term, not this term. But AL of my friends are in it this term! Oh well, I guess I'll go tALk to my counselor...

       Chamith, are you reading this?  I won't remark on yesterday except for that it was remarkably cold, windy, and rainy on my 30 minute walk home.  Today I briefly started to work on a French diALogue with Richie (oh, I'm sorry; he wants to be cALled "Rich" now... first he wouldn't let me cALl him Dickster, now he wouldn't even let me cALl  him Richie? Incroyable!), in which I was a poor lawyer who sold avocados to make extra money. This is comicAL because the word for lawyer in French is the same word for avocado in French.  I got my student ID, but I was a white rectangle in my picture, and I had a distinguishing mark across my face that said "PHOTO."  In Speech I researched my fate vs. free will debate (I'm arguing fate), which caused the professed stupidity of my partner to become apparent. I ALso had a fun but somewhat brief theologicAL conversation with Josh Turner (Alex Turner's brother), who is planning to be a pastor.  I had a double-block of History, the highlight of which was my public argument with my teacher, Mr. Vignone, about democracy/republic semantics.  Science was pretty fun, too.  This is the faceless wonder (see 4th paragraph), signing off.

       Today, as Matt remarked at lunch, seemed reALly short.  French, first period, is a bad class in generAL, made even worse by starting the day. Luckily, I can ALways count on Richie for comic relief, perpetuALly saying something in French ever so confidently, yet drenched in errors.  During Speech, my group prepared for a fate vs. free will debate (I'm arguing for fate) by sharing subtopics to discuss. I was the de facto leader, for it seemed that I had actuALly done thorough research, though I just brought in related articles that came to mind and quickly formed opinions and ideas based upon them. It was okay, except for when another in the group said "Oh, so I'm just a sack of cells; I don't have any emotions [etc.]" and I kind of insulted Roman Catholicism (my least favorite religion), to which half of my group belongs. Still, gouda nonetheless.  I think I'm going to do that Prague trip next summer, if ever.  Gym was tolerable for a change; I kind of like soccer.  I had a moldy sandwich today. I ate half of it before I noticed. Oh well, gouda leverage.  In math, my favorite class, I suggested that, for the last day of school, we eat a Fibonacci pizza, in which the slices go out in a spirAL. Ms. Green, my teacher, said yes, if I could make one. I think I will.

       My work load completely bALanced out. I had practicALly no homework yesterday, and little today; therefore I've been doing advance work so I won't have much homework later, so I'll do even more advance work, and the circle of no homework will continue, best case scenario.  It snowed maybe for hours today, and what is there to show for it? NOTHING! No snow anywhere in sight on the ground.  People who know about my hALf-day plan (you know who you are) get permission. Even if we don't see the movie, there are plenty of other things to do (like Newtonville Pizza, Cabot's, N64, Monopoly, and certain computer games).  My partner for Speech didn't do any useful work today. Well, you know the aphorism, if you want something done, get AL to do it.  Today is probably going to be my first reAL Mock TriALs meeting. Wish me luck in getting a gouda role.

       Chamith, you had better be reading this.  Yesterday I stayed up until MIDNIGHT doing history notes and related assignments. Yeah, I could have done them over the weekend, but I was working on my debate for Speech then.  Not much else happened recently except that I got Switzerland for Model U.N. and I want to do something on the half day next week such as going to my house and then to this West Newton movie.   Believe it or not, that's about it.

       Sorry I didn't post anything for a triumvirate of days (assuming they are a ruling party of three similar to the brief Roman government of Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus); I've been doing a lot of homework over the weekend, most notably research on my fate vs. free will debate for Speech. I'm doing fate, by the way.  I'm going to have an amazingly gouda argument.  I ALso know a gouda counter-argument, which I devised because it would be very depressing if we were just part of a cause-and-effect, set universe.  Not to brag, but it is my informed opinion that the opposing side is kind of  at a disadvantage because they don't have me.  If you haven't ALready heard, I didn't win the SFA election. I don't feel TOO bad, because Matt didn't win either, and I had no doubt that he would.   Eh.  At the first Mock Trials meeting, Alex Turner (who I suggested should be a podium) and John Garabedian were there, which was gouda.  It was virtuALly just a big promotionAL speech, which was very boring, and they said Mock Trials would be one's entire life if one got to be a lawyer, which was bada.  I'll still try to get a position, though.  I reALly should be getting to bed, so this is AL, signing off.

       Sorry I haven't posted anything in a while. Nothing much has happened. I wrote a reALly gouda 4-page essay on that pagan "religion"... what was it cALled again? You know, the one with AL the demigods and this crazy hippee that they killed, with AL those myths about fire and brimstone if you don't completely devote yourself to the cult... hmmm. Oh yeah, Christianity.  Christian-bashing aside, did anyone see that article on Alex Turner's brother and my Speech class acquaintance Josh? It was hilarious.  Speaking of hilarity, I think I'll type "The History of the World According to Student Bloopers," an incredibly funny segment of a book Ian gave me for my Bar Mitzvah. Stay tuned.

       Without further ado, here is the best of "The History of the World According to Student Bloopers":  Ancient Egypt was inhabited by mummies, and they all wrote in hydraulics.  They lived in the Sarah Dessert and traveled by Camelot.  The climate of the Sarah is such that the inhabitants have to live elsewhere, so certain areas of the dessert are cultivated by irritation.  The pyramids are a range of mountains between France and Spain.  The Egyptians built the pyramids in the shape of a huge triangular cube.  The Bible is full of interesting caricatures.  In the first book of the Bible, Guinessis, Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree.  One of their children, Cain, asked, "Am I my brother's son?"  God asked Abraham to sacrifice Isaac on Mount Montezuma.  Jacob, son of Isaac, stole his brother's birthmark.  Jacob was a patriarch who brought up his 12 sons to be patriarchs, but they did not take to it.  One of Jacob's sons, Joseph, gave refuse to the Israelites.  Pharaoh forced the Hebrew slaves to make bread without straw.  Moses led them to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened bread, which is bread made without any ingredients.  Afterwards, Moses went up on Mount Cyanide to get the ten commandments.  He died before he ever reached Canada.  David was a Hebrew king skilled at playing the liar.  He fought with the Finkelsteins, a race of people who lived in Biblical times.  Solomon, one of David's sons, had 300 wives and 700 porcupines.  The Greeks were a highly sculptured people, and without them we wouldn't have history.  The Greeks invented three kinds of columns �� corinthian, ironic, and dorc �� and built the Apocalypse.  They also had myths.  A myth is a female moth.  One myth says that the mother of Achilles dipped him in the River Stynx until he became intollerable.  Achilles appears in The Iliad, by Homer.  Homer also wrote The Oddity, in which Penelope was the last hardship that Ulysses endured on his journey.  Actually, Homer was not written by Homer but by another man of that name.  Socrates was a famous Greek teacher who went around giving people advice.  They killed him.  Socrates died from an overdose of wedlock.  After his death, his career suffered a dramatic decline.  The government of Athens was democratic because people took the law into their own hands.  There were no wars in Greece, as the mountains were so high that they couldn't climb over to see what their neighbors were doing.  When they fought with the Persians, the Greeks were outnumbered because the Persians had more men.  Eventually, the Romans conquered the Geeks.  History calls people Romans because they never stayed in one place for very long.  Julius Caesar extinguished himself on the battlefields of Gaul.  The Ides of March murdered him because they thought he was going to be made king.  Dying, he gasped out the words "Tee hee, Brutus."  Nero was a cruel tyranny who would torture his poor subjects by playing the fiddle to them.  Rome came to have too many luxuries and baths.  At Roman banquets, the guests wore garlics in their hair.  They took two baths in two days, and that's the cause of the fall of Rome.  Today Rome is full of fallen arches.  Then came the Middle Ages, when everyone was middle aged.  King Alfred conquered the Dames.  King Arthur lived in the Age of Shivery with brave knights on prancing horses and beautiful women.  King Harod mustarded his troops before the Battle of Hastings.  Joan of Arc was cannonized by Bernard Shaw.  And victims of the blue-bonnet plague grew boobs on their necks.  Finally, Magna Carta provided that no free man should be hanged twice for the same offense.  In midevil times most people were alliterate.  During this time, people put on morality plays about ghosts, goblins, virgins, and other mythical creatures.  Another story was about William Tell, who shot an arrow through an apple while standing on his son�s head.  The Renaissance was an age in which more individuals felt the value of their human being.    It was the painter Donatello�s interest in the female nude that made him the father of the Renaissance.  The government of England was a limited mockery.  From the womb of Henry VIII Protestantism was born.  Queen Elizabeth was the �Virgin Queen.�  As a queen she was a success.  When Elizabeth exposed herself before her troops, they all shouted �hurrah.�  Then her navy went out and defeated the Spanish Armadillo.  It was an age of great inventions and discoveries.  Gutenberg invented the Bible.  Another important invention was the circulation of blood.  The greatest writer of the Renaissance was William Shakespeare.  Shakespeare was born in the year 1564, supposedly on his birthday.  He lived at Windsor with his merry wives, writing tragedies, comedies, and errors.  In one of Shakespeare�s famous plays, Hamlet rations out his situation by relieving himself in a long soliloquy.  In another play, Lady Macbeth tries to convince Macbeth to kill the King by attacking his manhood.  The proof that the witches in Macbeth are supernatural is that no one could eat what they cooked.  The next great author was John Milton.  Milton wrote Paradise Lost.  Then his wife died and he wrote Paradise Regained.  During the Renaissance America began.  Christopher Columbus was a great navigator who discovered America while cursing about the Atlantic.  Many people died and many babies were born.  Captain John Smith was responsible for all this.  One of the causes of the Revolutionary War was the English put tacks in their tea.  Finally, the colonists won the War and no longer had to pay for taxis.  Thomas Jefferson, a Virgin, and Benjamin Franklin were two singers of the Declaration of Independence.  Franklin had gone to Boston carrying all his clothes in his pocket and a loaf of bread under each arm.  He invented electricity by rubbing two cats backwards and declared, �A horse divided against itself cannot stand.�  Franklin died in 1790 and is still dead.  Soon the Constitution of the United States was adopted to secure domestic hostility.  Under the Constitution the people enjoyed the right to keep bare arms.  Abraham Lincoln became America�s greatest Precedent.  Lincoln�s mother died in infancy, and he was born in a log cabin which he built with his own hands.  When Lincoln was president, he wore only a tall silk hat.  He said, �In onion there is strength. 	 Abraham Lincoln wrote the Gettysburg Address while traveling from Washington to Gettysburg on the back of an envelope. On the night of April 14, 1865, Lincoln went to the theater and got shot in his seat by one of the actors in a moving picture show.  Meanwhile in Europe, the enlightenment was a reasonable time.  Voltaire invented electricity and also wrote a book called Candy.  Gravity was invented by Isaac Walton.  It is chiefly noticeable in the autumn, when the apples are falling off the trees.  Johann Bach wrote a great many musical compositions and had a large number of children.  In between, he practiced on an old spinster which he kept up in his attic.  Bach died from 1750 to the present.  Bach was the most famous composer in the world, and so was Handel.  Handel was half German, half Italian, and half English.  He was very large.  Beethoven wrote music even though he was deaf.  He was so deaf he wrote loud music.  Beethoven expired in 1827 and later died for this.  The French Revolution was accomplished before it happened and catapulted into Napoleon.   During the Napoleonic Wars,  the crowned heads of Europe were trembling in their shoes.  Then the Spanish gorillas came down from the hills and nipped at Napoleon�s flanks.  The sun never set on the British Empire because the British Empire is in the East and the sun sets in the West.  Queen Victoria was the longest queen.  She sat on a thorn for 63 years.  The nineteenth century was a time of a great many thoughts and inventions.  People stopped reproducing by hand and started reproducing by machine.  Cyrus McCormick invented the McCormick raper, which did the work of a hundred men.  Louis Pasteur discovered a cure for rabbis.  Madman Curie discovered radio.  And Karl Marx became one of the Marx brothers.  The First World War, caused by the assignation of the Arch-Duck by an anahist, ushered in a new error in the anals of human history.

       I gave a gouda speech in Model U.N. today. I, Switzerland, said that everybody has nuclear weapons, especiALly the US, and the US has argued that having and even threatening to use nuclear weapons are not illegal, so why should we invade Iraq, which might have one in the future? Boo-yah grandma.  In other AL news, I'm going to do my debate tomorrow with Josh Turner (my original partner has mono). Wish AL luck!

       I hope you AL enjoyed the last post. That is one of the funniest things I know of.  Right now, I only have two things to say:  1) In English today, Ms. Craig-Olins was tALking about what happened during the fALl of Troy. One of the things she said was, and I quote, "Those who did not die were killed." :)  2) In math, I wondered, how do you know on those cops shows (like Law and Order) that when they say, "We caught the perp, chief," that they're tALking about the perpetrator of the crime, and not a perpendicular bisector? This led (with Richie's help) to the conception of a detective movie in which they catch the "perp", charging him with knowingly and willingly bisecting the opposite line at a 90 degree angle. At trial, he would argue that the evidence of this was inadmissable, for they measured his angles without a search warrant and without probable cause for believing he was harboring 2 equal sides, making him, under law, an isoceles triangle (which is punishable by 10 years in a maximum security Cartesian graph, forced to spend his days making congruent, equilaterAL license plates).

       I'm seeing Star Trek tomorrow with John and Jonny (and my father, Jonathan). Suprisingly, I was more persuaded to go by its NEGATIVE Globe review (titled "The Enterprise crew is still off-track) than its own preview, because the former makes it sound more interesting.  By the way, did you hear? Law resigned. I guess we'll have to go back to trials by ordeal.  One final thought: F comes before G in the alphabet of the mind.

       Sorry I haven't updated this in a while. If you're new to the blog (DANIEL WALDINGER!!!), be sure to check out the stuff below- some of it is way cool funny.  Aaaaaa! Here's my homework for Monday: reread a chapter, read a confusing thing about French grammar, do 4 French exercises, do flash cards for 15 French words, study 30 French words, write a biography on Achilles, locate and analyse a passage on him in an essay, write a long essay about the Crusades, study for a test about the High Middle Ages, study for a long vocabulary test, and study for a "quest" on chapter 4 (math)! I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Aaaaaa!  The book I checked out from the North library, "The Next 500 Years" is tres gouda; it gives the audience what it wants: tangents and lots of them.  In English, my summary of one of the books of "The Odyssey" had an appositive in practically every sentence (if you don't know what this is, I'll tell you: an appositive is YOU'RE STUPID!!!). This led Loren to exemplify: "Odysseus, being a man, walked over there. Athena, seeing him walk over there, also walked over there." Later, Ms. Craig-Olins said that Athena made Odysseus look like a god, so Loren wrote in his notes, "Odysseus = god).  I'll leave you with the following quote from a video:  "To the Europeans, the world looked like this, with Europe to the lower left. To the Muslims, the world looked like this, with Asia slightly larger than Europe. To the Chinese, the world was China."

       Yo yo yo, yo-yo!  In History, Mr. Vignone called on Justin, saying, "Jason," and he began his response with "It's Justin, and..." Later we were talking about the origins of our last names and Mr. Vignone called on Justin again, saying, "Wow, McGonnagle must be an interesting name." Justin said, "Yeah, it must be, but my last name's McConchie." Everyone call Justin Jason McGonnagle!  In Physics, I gave Mr. Nocera a dollar for a lab thing, saying, "I got this dollar signed by the Secretary of the Treasury!" Mr. Nocera replied, "Wow! This must be worth, like, a dollar!"  In Math, Ann (last name?) proposed something in a proof, and Ms. Green said, "Does anyone know where Ann got that?" and I said "from the dark recesses of her mind!"  Loren was over yesterday, and we were taking notes on the textbook.  Here are some direct quotes: "Official statements by the pope were called bulls....The bull of 1296 was aimed at the French king Philip IV....This bull declared that there were two powers on earth....Philip merely sneered at this bull."  In English, we were in the Mac lab, and Loren pointed out a sample bibliographical citation on the white board.  The author's name was "Charles Mills Gayley."  I know, it's homophobic, but hilarious nonetheless!  I'll leave you with one final thought: "Shakawho?"

       Something I thought of while pontificating about the nature of quotations (not really!):  "We're gonna paint this town red."  "Aaah! Communism!"  "So what? There ain't no law against being communist!"  "But there is against vandalism! Ooooh!"

       Greetings, fellow delegates!  Life's all full of work and anxiety and confusion these days, but I won't burden you with my troubles. Here's some funny stuff:  A direct quote from Loren: "I don't like going over to other people's houses. Like, in math class, Kevin was like, 'Do you want to come over?' and I was like, 'No.'"  It was very helpful in explaining the situation.  In Math, we did this logic packet.  Here's a directly-quoted example from an exercise: "The United States is not north of Mexico if and only if the moon is made of green cheese."  In Speech, the last line of somebody's presentation was, "The fate of the chimpanzees is the fate of us all," and Dan Waldinger said, "Wait, so we're going to be poached by a superior species?"  I have only one word to say: [laugh wholeheartedly].  Put THAT in your pipe and smoke it, Louis the German!

       Congratulations and thank you if you read the entire list below.  I don't have any new funny stuff today, but you can see Loren's blog for a hilarious conversation we had (http://mandyell.blogspot.com), and I'll include an old thing that I haven't posted yet.  These days I've been reading a lot of MSN Learning and Research columns (http://encarta.msn.com/column/).  Many are very interesting, like two about head transplants and parthogenesis.  The majority aren't that gruesome, for the weak-stomached audience.  I've written an essay on Shackleton vs. Odysseus that's six full pages long (plus a few small pictures).  Eat that, Pavarotti (and he says, "Okay. Crunch!")  Here's the funny thing:  Often in math class, my teacher (and today on Law and Order: SVU, the ADA) says, "Did anything about this give you pause?" I always respond (somewhat audibly), "Aaaah! What happened to my hands??!!!!"  Hilarious.

        Several Things (see seventh Listing) Today:     -primarily-  Two direct Quotes from Ms. Craig-Olins (English)-           1) "In general�always, actually�assignments are due the day that they are due."           2) "Mentor is sometimes Mentor, but mostly he's Athena."   -secondly-  On Saturday, I did almost the entire Musaf at my Temple.  I had lost the Tape, so I had tried to reach Josh Sowalsky unsuccessfully (I called literally 10 Times at varying Times of the Day and on varying Days of the Week!) then I eventually enlisted Jacob Levenfeld (who didn't really help much at all).  I only messed up once, the Part that Jacob didn't know.   -tertiarily-  I suppose I'll go to Tanzania. Barely anyone else I know is going, and, as Bilbo says in Fellowship of the Ring, "I don 't know you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you as well as you deserve." Still, there are some good People.  I don't know what I'll do about the five grand I have to raise, because I happen to have $5,000 in my bank Account that I've been meaning to put into a savings Account.  Oh well; I guess I'll raise what I can, and then use the account Money for the Difference.   -fourthly-  In Model UN, (Go Switzerland, "the land of the Swiss,") we're Mauritania at the New York Conference, and I signed up for SPECPOL (special political Something or Other). It's completely UNnecessary (not really, I just like the Pun).   -fifthly-  Boy (I sure use a lot of Parentheses, don't I? (of course, maybe it's a natural Inclination (myself being a convoluted sentence-writer))).   -sixthly-  I'm reading "Prelude to Foundation."  It's OK, but I haven't been able to read much since last Weekend.  It seems like they've been on this particular Part of the Planet for a really long Time, but maybe that's just because I've been reading more slowly.   -seventhly-  I've decided to become a lingual Purist, using more British Spellings and etymologically correct Styles of Writing (I don't know if I'll start capitalising major Words like they used to a few Centuries ago, though).  By the way, For Your Information, O.K. is short for Oll Korrect, an old Joke by a Newspaper.  Furthermore, the proper Spelling is "Programme" for a television or theatre Show, or anything of the sort besides computer Programs.  -penultimately-  In math, Ms. Green was talking about Great Circles (they go around the poles of the Earth) and in my math Notebook , I wrote, "Great Circle: A really good circle."   -ultimately-  Why does everyone seem to have watched the Super Bowl? Bowling is so boring!

       I will only post one situation, this time from Model UN:  As you all know, Maria Fulwiler is obsessive about England.  And yet, at Model UN, she sarcastically agrees with everything the US says, in mockamatation of Tony Blair. This happened at a recent meeting, and Loren and I had the following conversation and conceputalization (without specific citations:  "Wait, doesn't Maria, like, idolize England?"  "Maybe she idolizes every part of England EXCEPT Tony Blair.... and yet models herself after him."  "Maybe Tony Blair is watching from his secret camera, and he's like, 'Is that really how people think of me?'"  "'I resign.'"   -also-  In Model UN, I made a hilarious speech, saying "We Swiss are a scholarly people."  Afterward I yielded to Ben Ostrogoth, Nepal, who wasn't prepared.

       Caliente!  To any readers of Loren's blog, "convo" is not a word, nor is it an abbreviation. I mean, come on, would the full word be convosation?  I don't have much to say today, so I'll leave you with this Family Guy� moment...  "Does anyone here speak English?"  "I don't speak English."  "But you just said something in English."  "I only know that sentence and this one explaining it."  "That's impossible!"  "�Que?"

       Here are two quotes from various classes:  Jacob Fleming: "Sex is everything."  Ms. Green (Math): "This is the sort of equation where the solution jumps off the blackboard and bites you in the face."  John Garabedian (who happens to be ARMENIAN and yet hasn't watched "Ararat" yet) came over on Sunday after Mock Trials to watch "1776."  We both thought it was quite hilarious when during the song "But, Mr. Adams," during all of the dialogue, Ben Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston sang "la la la, la la, la la la.  La la la, la la la la, la la la, la la la.  La la la, la la, la la la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la la la la."  Then, after Thomas Jefferson said to John Adams, "Mr. Adams you are driving me to homicide!"  The trio sang, "Homicide, homicide, we may see murder yet!"  I'll leave you with these vulgar but hilarious quotes from history:  "Sundiata" Packet: "Standing in the position of a soldier at ease, Sogolon Djata, supported by his enormous rod, was sweating great beads of sweat."  Mr. Blanchett, Describing a Picture of Mansa Musa: "Here we see his rod..."

       I have nothing funny to say.   Richie, John Garabedian, Loren, Matt, and whoever else reads this who is in Model UN: I urgently need you to speak in favor of my resolution.  If you don't like it, tell me what's wrong with it, and it'll be amended.  Write your own speeches, unless you want me to write more.  I really need your help, guys.

       Hi everyone.  I haven't posted anything in over two weeks; I guess I just haven't thought of anything funny.  Loren did direct me to a quite hilarious site, however (though all of my readers probably already know of it), http://www.homestarrunner.com.  I could write quotes, like Loren did, but it's better to see the 'toons for yo' own self.  Anyone who wants to see a movie over Spring Break (during which I'm doing hardly anything), such as Bulletproof Monk, Head of State, or Phone Booth; or wants to play badminton and/or N64, let me know.  Richie/John, if the latter isn't going to Canada, we should play some Monkeyball 2.  If Will McClaughlin ever e-mails me, we will most likely co-sponsor a resolution on the Palestinian question.  This resolution would probably include the creation of a recognized Palestinian state, UN peacekeeper involvement, and enforcement of former Israeli-PLO agreements such as the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements and past UN resolutions.  I strongly urge any Model UN readers to sign this presently-theoretical resolution once it is written.  If Ian reads this blog, thank you again for recommending "1984."  An excellent read.  I'll leave you, albeit hypocritically (see second paragraph) with this message:  "ARE YOU ASKING FOR A CHALLENGE??!!!!"

       It has been a while since this blog has been updated, so here it is, the next post:  My resolution, Resolution 1.1, passed, the yeas being over twice as plentiful as the nays (30 to 15).  All of the amendments I voted for also passed.  As you all know, I, John Garabedian, Richie, Loren, and others went to New York City.  I noticed there were many "I Love NY" T-shirts and mugs, but few "I don't particularly care for NY" ones, even in New Jersey (in Hoboken, land of the Hoboes).  I agree with Richie's analysis of the city, an "urban wasteland."  The Cloisters wasn't too interesting, but "Rent" was pretty gouda�� no Star Trek X, mind you.  The wax museum was mildly entertaining, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art was good, except that we didn't have enough time to admire the paintings, and I didn't recognize anything from "Don't Eat the Pictures!"  The Hard Rock Cafe was disappointingly bad, even though I'd been there before.  Overall, it was a bland, smelly odyssey of the nose.  X2 was definitely worth seeing, as I'm sure Matrix Reloaded will be.  Oh, and I got a 100% on my history test (Reformation).  Sit on that, Arthur Fonzarelli (Who's Jewish, by the way).  I must add DIE ALL NON-CARD, NON-MAELSTROM COMPUTER GAMES!!! THAT MEANS YOU, WARCRAFT!!!  The faux MCAS was kind of confusing, I don't think I did as well as last year, but of course it counts for naught.  I'll close on this quote from one of the world's wisest philosophers:  Harry Truman, Doris Day, Red China, Johnnie Ray South Pacific, Walter Winchell, Joe DiMaggio Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe  Rosenbergs, H-bomb, Sugar Ray, Panmunjom Brando, "The King and I" and "The Catcher in the Rye" Eisenhower, vaccine, England's got a new queen Marciano, Liberace, Santayana goodbye  We didn't start the fire It was always burning since the world's been turning We didn't start the fire No we didn't light it but we tried to fight it  Joseph Stalin, Malenkov, Nasser and Prokofiev Rockefeller, Campanella, Communist Bloc Roy Cohn, Juan Peron, Toscanini, dacron Dien Bien Phu falls, "Rock Around the Clock"  Einstein, James Dean, Brooklyn's got a winning team Davy Crockett, Peter Pan, Elvis Presley, Disneyland Bardot, Budapest, Alabama, Krushchev Princess Grace, "Peyton Place", trouble in the Suez  We didn't start the fire It was always burning since the world's been turning We didn't start the fire No we didn't light it but we tried to fight it  Little Rock, Pasternak, Mickey Mantle, Kerouac Sputnik, Chou En-Lai, "Bridge on the River Kwai" Lebanon, Charles de Gaulle, California baseball Starkweather, homicide, children of thalidomide  Buddy Holly, "Ben Hur", space monkey, Mafia Hula hoops, Castro, Edsel is a no-go U-2, Syngman Rhee, payola and Kennedy Chubby Checker, "Psycho", Belgians in the Congo  We didn't start the fire It was always burning since the world's been turning We didn't start the fire No we didn't light it but we tried to fight it  Hemingway, Eichmann, "Stranger in a Strange Land" Dylan, Berlin, Bay of Pigs invasion "Lawrence of Arabia", British Beatlemania Ole Miss, John Glenn, Liston beats Patterson Pope Paul, Malcolm X, British politician sex JFK, blown away, what else do I have to say  We didn't start the fire It was always burning since the world's been turning We didn't start the fire No we didn't light it but we tried to fight it  Birth control, Ho Chi Minh, Richard Nixon back again Moonshot, Woodstock, Watergate, punk rock Begin, Reagan, Palestine, terror on the airline Ayatollah's in Iran, Russians in Afghanistan  "Wheel of Fortune", Sally Ride, heavy metal, suicide Foreign debts, homeless vets, AIDS, crack, Bernie Goetz Hypodermics on the shores, China's under martial law Rock and roller cola wars, I can't take it anymore  We didn't start the fire It was always burning since the world's been turning We didn't start the fire No we didn't light it but we tried to fight it  We didn't start the fire But when we are gone will it still burn on, and on, and on, and on..

       Guess what time of year has just arrived?  FinALs!  These are the first finals that I, or any other freshman, have ever taken.  I'm conflicted, whether I should be stressed or not, since, on the one hand, I don't really think they'll be that hard, but on the other hand, there's a lot of preparing to do that I've been procrastinating about.  Today I took the first part of my finals, a French composition.  It wasn't too bad, save for that at the beginning, I was more nervous than I have been in a long time.  Well, since I just finished the movies I got at Blockbuster and the library ("The Mark of Zorro," "The Road to Perdition," "The Man in the Iron Mask," "Changing Lanes," and "Waking Life," all pretty gouda), I might start doing what I be needing to do.  By the way, since you would normally say "I do not ask," instead of "I ask not," shouldn't you say "I do not be," instead of "I am not..."?  Something I just learned from "Waking Life": to test whether or not you're dreaming, see if you can read numbers and small print, and try changing the light levels by flicking a light switch.  If the first is illegible, and if the second is impossible, you're probably asleep.  For more cool philosophical stuff, I would highly recommend "Waking Life."  In closing, here is this part of Steve Martin's "A Wild and Crazy Guy,":  Last summer, I had a few days off, so I decided to go to Paris.  I figured, I don't speak a word of French, English is an international language, no problem, it'll be easy.  The first indication I have trouble, I get off the plane, step into a taxi, say to the driver, "I would like to go to a hotel, please,"  Driver turns to me and goes, "Jeune te suis, les de deux de toi?!"  "What?! What is that you're saying? Hahahahaha."  So, the first thing you do, this is really dumb, you adopt a French accent.  "Ah would lak to go to ze otel."  So that's nothing, so I got a little French phrasebook, hoping to memorize little phrases, like "Where is the bathroom?"  But French is not like Spanish, Spanish is easy for Americans, you can sound it out, you just go, "Casa dey peypey.  Dundey esta, casa dey peypey?"  But French is like, "June de les troighgh.  Jutune noighghgh"  "Come quickly, doctor!"  "What happened, what happened?"  "He spoke French!  Help him."  So anyway, all I could remember was chesse omelette: "omelette du fromage."  I'd be practicing saying it all the time, "omelette du fromage."  Go up to people on the street, "Hey, omelette du fromage!"  So I go into a restaurant, waiter comes up to me, and I say "Omelette du fromage."  Except then, the waiter thinks you speak French, he says, "Jeune te suis, les de deux de toi?!"  And I go, "Yes!"  And he brings you a shoe with cheese on it... and you also told him to stuff it down your throat.  "I'll have a shoe with cheese on it, stuff it down my throat, and I want to massage your grandmother, alright?"

       Summer has finally arrived, school and finals have ended, and two and a half months of absolutely nothing have just begun.  As an end-of-the-year special, here are some of the best quotes of the year:  "Everyone thought he was going to die a hundred times." – Mr. Vignone  "I don't know if it's a custom to live with your husband's brother when you die." – Mr. Blanchet  "I want your eyeballs and your earballs on this 500 percent!" – Mr. Vignone  "He is married to Draupadi, but he's not Draupadi's son." – Mr. Blanchet  "A third is clergy, a third is nobility, but TWO thirds is the bourgeoisie." – Mr. Vignone  "This is not Mr. B's hizzouse of babysitting." – Mr. Blanchet  "It gives you license to whack!" – Ms. Craig-Olins  "Where the hell is Spain?" – Jacob Fleming  "Mentor is sometimes Mentor, but mostly he's Athena." – Ms. Craig-Olins  "The bull of 1296 was aimed at Henry....Philip merely sneered at this bull." – History Textbook   And now, the memorable dialogues:  Mr. Vignone (theoretically): Loren, during World War Two, who did the Nazis sign a non-aggression pact with?  Loren (theoretically): Presumably someone much shorter!  ---  Mr Vignone: Do you know the dilemma he's caught in?  Stephanie: Yeah, between liberty and freedom.  ----  Ms. Craig-Olins: What season is that?  C-Block: May.

       Like other academes, I can't wait for school to start, and especially for Model UN. I've made a list of 20 countries I'd want to be, sorted by importance so that if I don't get the most important, I can get the runner-up and if not that then the second runner-up and so on. I won't post the list to avoid manipulation and wheelings-and-dealings by other MUNers to prevent me from getting one of those nations.  I just finished reading and taking notes on "United Nations: The First Fifty Years," from which I learned much about the history of and strategy in the UN. I plan to apply methods therein to my sophomore MUN career.

       I've decided to take Alexander Dietz Online offline for a number of reasons, including the lack of original entertainment, maintenance that will become impossible during the busy new school year, and plain old laziness. The added "features" will be available on The Al Blog, using the Alexander Dietz Online page to transport multimedia and such. As you may have noticed, the URL for Alexander Dietz Online now leads you to The Al Blog, so continue to use it instead of rikou.blogspot.com. Stay tuned for updates every Sunday.

       At Brian's birthday party on Saturday, I was complaining about everyone eating pizza with chicken (milk with meat), and Loren brought up a good point: shouldn't the rule be that you shouldn't eat dairy with   mammal   meat? The rule is "Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk," and only mammals produce milk! Take that, rabbinical tradition!

       Like most students, I got my classes recently. In case you're wondering, the first three numbers to the left of the classes are the course number, and the number to the right of the dash is the section number. Tell me if you match any set of numbers.  031-1 A.M. Swim 101-4 Honors English 10 B-Block 133-1 Myth, Folk Tale & SF C-Block 2nd Semester 178-1 Eng: TV Production C-Block 1st Semester 203-2 Honors French 3 D-Block 420-2 Honors Wrld Hist 1815 E-Block 472-1 Mock Trials 502-3 Honors Math 2 A-Block 602-4 Honors Chemistry Lab G-Block 695-26 Homeroom  So far, I know that Jonny's in my math class and Loren's in my history class.  I have to go to school on Wednesday because I don't have a gym class second semester and I'm not signed up for Model UN as a class.  Readers, let me know if you want to do anything with me; the summer's a-waning.

       I recently had the following idea; below is a copy of my e-mail to the Department of Transportation.    To the Department of Transportation:  A concerned citizen, I am woed by the amount of injuries and fatalities caused by alcohol-related driving accidents in the United States. My proposal: to incorporate Breathalyzers® into new cars that would not allow themselves to be started if the driver's blood-alcohol level were too high. The technology would be simple, so it would not be a gargantuan task to regulate the instruments' gradual addition over the next few years or decade. For my argument, I present the following syllogism:  1. In 2002, 14,480 people were killed in alcohol-related crashes (source: National Center for Statistics and Analysis).  2. A Breathalyzer®-integrated car would inhibit most drunken people from driving a car.  3. The aforementioned proposal would prevent most alcohol-related fatalities.  Yes, expense would be expended, but a little money would go a long way in preventing tens of thousands of deaths every year. Please study this proposal for those future victims.  I appreciate the work of your organization, and thank you for your time and attention.   Sincerely,  Alexander Dietz  Sophomore, Newton North High School  Newton, Massachusetts

       Well, at Rockport today, I asked the milk/mammal meat question (see below) to my rabbi aunt. She said that chickens used to be considered birds and therefore in a different category than regular meat (so you could eat them with dairy). However, she said, the current philosophy is that you shouldn't do something that looks like breaking a commandment even if it's technically legal (under Jewish law). It's like shredding documents... even if you aren't obstructing justice, it's still pretty shady, and if you start committing simulated crimes, then you won't care as much about not committing actual crimes. Ask my aunt about it if you still aren't convinced.

       Well, we've had 1.5 days of school so far, and I'm already back into the rhythm.  My math teacher, Mr. Stanley, seems really laid-back.  He said that we could do the homework if we felt like it, it's no big deal.  He played music during class and George calls him a hippie (he had him for stats last year).  Jonny and Jacob Fleming are in my class; I'm surprised at how little they've both spoken (with Jonny's nerdiness (no offense) and Phlegm's sassmouth).  I have math in the same room as last year, but for some reason the chalk squeaks now (I wrote my answers to a problem on the board) when it didn't before.  My English class seems pretty average, in terms of room, assignments, and teacher.  My teacher, Ms. Kraines, says we'll be doing a lot of analysis... ugh.  Why can't we just read books without dissecting?  I've had one essay so far, 2.5 pages.  Banjo's in my class, by the way.  TV Production (teacher: Ms. Rossman) looks like it'll be fun and educational without that time-consuming.  So far we've talked about different shots and the politics of the media.  It seems like I'm the only one raising my hand in that class.  It also looks as if I'll be able to work from home since they have the latest Mac technology (yay!).  French was OK.  Ian and Ostrogoth are in my class.  The work looks ordinary, like last year.  The only problem is that my teacher, Mme. DeRobert, talks very softly while the air conditioning is running loudly; Ian didn't hear a word she said (which was a problem since he didn't hear the homework assignment).  I'm not sure whether she's French or just of Frankish descent; she hasn't said anything in English so far but all French teachers do that on the first day.  History was good too.  My teacher, Ms. Heidlage, is Charlie's mother.  It looks pretty much the same as last year except this time, the teacher seems to know about history and we might actually learn in class instead of just from the textbook.  Loren's in my class.  Chemistry, I'm not so sure about.  Ian, Richie, and that British kid Matt are in my class.  The teacher, Ms. Srikanth, has been nice so far but I have a feeling she's going to be strict.  Our class is mostly juniors.  I was miffed because on this homework sheet we did based on this "Safety Contract," some of the questions weren't covered on the contract and required a knowledge of chemistry to answer, like "True or False: Never clean up an acid with a base."  I haven't taken Chemistry before, how am I supposed to know?  Overall, it looks like I'll be doing homework all day (I've already had two essays and the equivalents of two more).  But I'll manage.  You're reading the words of a writing master.

       There hasn't been a lot of interesting stuff going on lately.  Sure, we just finished the first week of school, but school is....school.  Honors seem to have the same or lower work level as Curriculum I had last year.  Outside of academia, TV's been pretty good.  The Conan O'Brien 10th Anniversary Special is on in a few hours.  It's a clip show, but it still might be funny.  The OC is always new and good on Tuesdays, and a lot of the great shows, like ER, the West Wing, Law and Order, etc., will be premiering this week.  Next weekend, I plan to see "American Splendor," and the weekend after, "Luther."  Anyone who wants to come is welcome.  Two good quotes were said this week:  "Anything I write on the board, you should probably write on the board." – Ms. Rossman, my TV Production teacher  "For example, the Sun is many millions of light years away from the Earth..." – Ms. Srikanth, my Chemistry teacher  That's all for now.  Check back next Sunday.

       A few days ago, I switched to my father's system of organizing school stuff:  Now I use a single notebook (beside math) with combined folders at the back; I put stuff I get in class in the built-in pocket, keep homework in the combined folders, and keep notes and unimportant handouts in a binder at home.  I was wary of the method when I began school, but so far it's working nicely.  Richie, Ian, and I (no comment from Matt Woolf) are miffed at our Chemistry teacher, Ms. Srikanth.  She's a good teacher and all, but she changed her mind like five times about whether or not to round sig figs before cutting off the insignificant figs.  Now she says we heard her wrong the last time every time she changes her story.  To quote Strong Sad, "This is getting frustrating.  I'm getting really frustrated."  Model UN starts tomorrow.  I'm not sure when I'm going to get a country, but since I know I'm getting a selected one, it might be then.  I erred last post, saying that last week was season premiere week.  This coming week is.  The only premiere of last week was of Boston Public, but this week (and I'm sure this time), the Laws and Orders, West Wing, ER, etc. will premiere.  Sorry, y'all (not like any of you watch NBC anyway, though it's a much better network than the War channel or any of those other cable channels).  Several new quotes have been said this week:  "Everyone should be in their own lockers," –Mr. Aronson  "If someone tells you to do something, do it," –Mr. Aronson  "Potassium nitrate is classified as explosive, so you should always put it in flammable containers," –Ms. Srikanth  "If I heard the mare correctly..." –Ms. Heidlage  "If they had another block, I'd take six science courses instead of five!" –Ms. Heidlage, imitating a REALLY driven student

       Howdy, y'all!    Well, the NBC premieres this week were pretty good, though a few were somewhat marred by George's presence.  Those of ER, the West Wing, and Will and Grace were probably the best.    In the "premiere" of Model UN, Matt K-K (Japan) and I wrote a resolution condemning NNHS renovations (the school is fine).  It failed, but we only got to read the preambulatory clauses, which aren't very important.  I got Russia, the largest country in the world, one of the former Superpowers, and a permanent member of the Security Council with veto power.  The next issue is nucleics, both weaponry and energy. Russia seems to have a strong opinion on the former, advocating the CTBT (Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty). Only nine more countries need to ratify the treaty for it to become universal, and Russia aims to commit them to it. I don't know what my opinion should be on nuclear energy though, because it doesn't really seem to be a debatable topic. Stay tuned for a resolution on nuclear weapons.    Saturday and Sunday were Rosh Hashanah, or as Josh Magid slurs it, "Rushana." I walked to and from an Orthodox Temple both days; Since we couldn't blow it on Shabbat, on the second I heard the shofar.     That's pretty much it- everyone vote for my resolution, coming soon.     P.S. Here are two recent quotes from my history teacher, Ms. Heidlage:     "Do put in your input."    "You can make as many transactions as you want...up to five...per round."    -You will have a loss for every transaction you do not make.   -You mean, a loss of nothing?  -Yes.    So really there were three.

       I haven't updated this for like three weeks, I know, but a lot of stuff has happened.    Two weeks ago was Yom Kippur; fasting galore; that was not fun (but Judaism's still awesome).  We Jews give you Christians so many holidays, and you get to enjoy them while we have to starve and work ourselves to death.  Grrr.  By the way, Yom Kippur's ban on work was one factor for my blog tardiness.  Josh Turner wouldn't accept a pamphlet I got at temple* called "The Jewish Response to Missionaries: Jews for Judaism" because it said all this stuff about how all the Christian citations of Jewish foretelling of Jesus were terribly mistranslated (like "And he sojourned there," was translated as "Christ is our Saviour, Hallelujah!" (but not actually)).  Oh well, whadayagannado?  *Now we go to our old, orthodox temple in Nonantum again, near where we used to live (up until I was two and a half months old).  Our house was across the street from that of the head of the Newton mafia.  We go there now because my dad wants to avoid this woman from his school who goes to the conservative temple we went to.  Last week I applied to this French Exchange Program thing, to go to France for a month in February.  It sounds pretty cool, though I'm not amazing at understanding spoken French; the essay and schlepping for recommendations I had to do were other factors in the blog lateness.  I might not get in despite my obvious excellence, though, because the packet said the Selection Committee "is concerned about students who over-committ themselves," and I'm in three clubs and five honors as it is.  This weekend, myself and the rest of the Tanzania group (including Charlie Mokriski and others) went to South Egremont, MA for a training mission.  We hiked twelve miles in one day with really heavy packs on (we were there for three days total), climbed the highest mountain in Connecticut, cooked our own food, slept in tents, and drank nothing but water (which we had to boil for water bottles and cooking in tiny stoves).  Tiring, and annoying (especially this really aggravating Wilson kid), but alright overall.  I wasn't home Friday, Saturday, and Sunday; this led to a homework crunch and the failure to update my blog.  The last big thing was an essay on Liberia (my assigned country) in history.  We had like three weeks to do it, but I had so much other stuff going on that I did no research, notes, outline, or writing until yesterday (it was due today).  Still, I managed to throw together a fairly long and good paper, supporting the wonderful thesis throughout and stuffed with as many metaphors as I could pack in.  Here's my last sentence (I had mentioned the sword of Damocles earlier in the conclusion: "With every new challenge, a piece of the thread unravels, and so without radical change, it is only a matter of time before the dagger falls…"  I was saying that a combination of bad economy and civil war would ruin Liberia throughout the paper.  I've never used an ellipsis at the end of a sentence in an essay before; I think it worked out pretty well.  Sue that, Jackie Childs.  Well, that's it.  Strong Bad was pretty weak, bad this week, with the Cheat e-mail, I thought, on a completely related note.  After the PSAT on Saturday, Jonny, Loren, and I ought to see "Kill Bill."  I'll talk to them in class later about that.  No good quotes in the last few weeks (or as Brian would say, the last coupl'a while).  Instead, I'll end with the latest edition of Conan O'Brien's "Celebrity Secrets," said by Conan and guest Jack Black:  "The Chicago Cubs and Boston Red Sox will meet in the World Series up in the bleachers where they'll have a great view of the Yankees and Braves."  "The recording artist once named Pink will be called 'Beige' when people realize that that's the color you get when you mix her name with the crap she records."   "Thanks to advances in automation, Nike shoes will be made by robots. Unfortunately, the robots will be made by children in Malaysia."   "We will at last have definitive proof that Jesus is the Son of God when Jesus borrows and wrecks God's Chevy Cavalier."  "A man with a bulge in his crotch will be asked by his girlfriend if he has a banana in his pocket or if he's just happy to see her. In fact, he will both be happy to see her and have a banana in his pocket. From that point on, men with bulges will be asked "Is that a banana in your pocket and/or are you happy to see me?""  "Shoehorns will stop helping feet slide into shoes and start trying to bang the shoes themselves."   "Ancient scrolls will reveal that Noah originally planned on bringing three of each species on his ark; not to save them from the flood but just to see if any of the animals were into that kind of thing."   "California Governor Gary Coleman releases all the inmates from the state penitentiaries in order to be reunited with the cast of Diff'rent Strokes."   "Anna Nicole Smith will team up with the makers of Altoids Mints to introduce their newest flavor, Winter Bacon."   "The line between Hasidic Jews and the Amish will further blur when the Amish start performing Barn Mitzvahs."   "Rumors that Batman and Robin are gay will be confirmed when they legally change their names to Topman and Bottom."   "Bars will serve a popular new drink called Jack Black and Coke. It will be two parts whisky, one part Coke and three parts Whoop Ass, Beatch."

       Loren, when in the midst of a game or something, often mixes words when he loses.  When he lost a game of Z-Kart, he said the following:  "This is so sorrel!"  He said he thought maybe he was combining "stupid" and "horrible."  That reminds me of when Strong Bad came up with "Dumples" for CGNU's team masking, thinking he might've meant "Dumplings," but he was really hungry at the time.  Read below for a recent post.  Oh, btw, here's another Loren quote from today:  "No! Mine's stiffer!"

       Getting right into things, I recently got accepted for the French Exchange Program, so I'll be living in France for a month in February.  Which is good (especially for college, which is a big reason why I do any NNHS stuff), 'cept that I can't really understand what real French people are saying when they talk fast.  I get "Attack of the Clones" when I play it in French, but that's only because I pretty much know what they're saying already and they slow it down to correspond to the English-speaking mouths.  Oh well, whadayagannado (is that annoying?  It looks like it would be)?  Other peeps going include Yan (you know, from French last year) and Maddy Abromowitz.  I think it'll be kind of easy, since I'll only be doing NNHS work while I'm there, but we'll see how it affects my grade.  It certainly couldn't hurt my college resume that much.  Loren has such a stupid blog.  He keeps putting ellipses (dot dot dots) instead of periods, which would be alright except a) he doesn't talk like that, and b) it's really annoying when it keeps going for multiple paragraphs.  Just picture someone talking like that, and it'll tick you off before five seconds.  And another thing, have you read his "plan" to save money by not buying lunch, though with admitted spending sprees.  Food is the most important thing you can buy with money; you shouldn't starve yourself for a hat or something.  He also buys clothes... shouldn't his parents do that?  Ending (I don't want to ramble on too long), here are some long-awaited quotes, both said in history:  "Whereas if you go around murdering people just because you're a murderer..." (and I was like, well that's a good reason) ---Ms. Heidlage  -How do you know she was doing it for women's suffrage? -Oh, she died, she died! -But how do you know she did it for women's suffrage? -Oh, it was real, it really happened! -But how do you know she did it for women's suffrage? -Oh, she did, she did. ---Jessica Li questioning Ms. Heidlage (apparently a little miscommunication)

       This week = a lot good, a lot bad.  I'll elaborate:  BAD  The main bad thing this week has been a time crunch at the end.  This was the result of a number of factors, including my school work, my procrastination, my necessary TV, and my hordes of extracurricular activities.  These included Model UN on Monday (and that takes pretty much the whole day after school since it's not like I'm going to go home); Richie's pseudo-party on Wednesday which took the whole day up till Mock Trials which lasted two more hours, and the remainder of the day was taken up by the return of The OC and a new Law and Order; dentist and babysitting on Thursday; and orthodontist on Friday.  A unit test in history (about the Industrial Revolution, not studied for until Thursday because of Richie's thing) proved the crux of my overscheduling.  Phew.   GOOD  At Model UN on Monday, my resolution went very well, gaining popular support.  I think it'll probably be approved.  Read it at http://www.smetna.com/mun; it's Resolution 1.2.  Matt K-K's resolution (1.1, same site) has good intentions, but it creates a whole new committee that does the same thing as the IAEA but builds new factories and hires new scientists and starts new programmes– it is, in a word, a boondoggle.  There were new episodes of Judging Amy, The OC, Law and Order, Scrubs, and ER.  Need I say more?  Richie's Wednesday pseudo-party was very fun.  We had pizza delivered and played a Star Wars game, Super Smash Bros. Melee (in which my alliance with John, the Judeo-Armenian Empire, proved virtually undefeatable), and Boston Monopoly (in which a few wheelings and dealings caused hotels to sprout up out of nowhere instantaneously and everyone controlled a row).  It took practically until Mock Trials, and so I couldn't study for my history test until Thursday, but it was totally worth it.  Mock Trials was a success.  Alex Turner and I presented "our" direct examination of Officer Thorndike (I wrote it while he played calculator games), and despite some flaws, Elliot said that we would both be "strong contenders for roles."  I don't know whether he was telling the truth though; he doesn't really have "a basis for being believed."  I drew my last Carter comics; Hemmill and the gang will be gone forever come Monday, but with any luck the new case will lend itself to humor, interest, and chances for me to move up in the Mock Trials hierarchy.  After hearing Sully's terribly-performed cross of Rissa, I still think he'll be a leading Trial-Mocker eventually, but only by default since we have so few good returning players.  I hope to join him in this dominance, mainly so I'll get a role.  Finally, at least the history test is over.  No more industrialization.  Ever.

       Thursday's history was one gimongo drug-fest-o-rama-con-box social.  We were talking about whether this liberalist guy would have wanted marijuana to be illegal, and the following quotes resulted:  "Someone has to take care of these people until they overdose and die." ---Ms. Heidlage  "That's why I limited it to heroin, because I knew people like you would pop up and disagree." ---Ms. Heidlage  -It's not like if they legalized marijuana everybody would be running to the nearest drug store... -Oh, I'd be out that door right away! ---Will O'Leary and Ms. Heidlage  Here are some other, non-drug-related quotes that sprung up:  "Does anyone have a wild objection to either one?" ---Ms. Heidlage, and I'm like "Waaaalawalaawalla! Not number two!"  "[Edmund Burke] has -- and continues to have -- a wide number of followers." ---Ms. Heidlage, and I'm like, "Once they get to the cemetery, there isn't much farther to go..."  "They committed a crime at the time they committed a crime." ---Ms. Heidlage  After history, we saw Charlie Heidlage in the hall, and Loren was like, "Hey Charlie! Your mom!" and I'm like "I don't think he knows what you're talking about..." and so he ran after him and explained that she was a pothead; he said she had sent similar messages during another sophomore history class.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Here's the new and revised, but still tentative, plan for the Matrix Revolutions:  On Tuesday, Veterans' Day, Jonny, John, Loren, and myself will meet at Cabot's at 10:30am.  We'll eat lunch, go to John's house, then leave when we have to (around 11:45).  John's mother will drive us to the Framingham theater, where we'll see the 12:30 showing.  Afterward, maybe we'll hang out at John's house; we'll decide that en route.

       On Monday, I got the new Mock Trials case before Model UN.  It's about file-sharing; this professor is being sued for contributing to the theft of music.  I haven't actually read it yet; there'll be more on it after the meeting tomorrow.  At MUN, my resolution won, barely.  The vote was 22 yeas and 18 nays, with 22 abstentions.  No one bothered to look at the MUN site (http://www.smetna.com/mun/) so they didn't get copies and just voted with sociable Matt K-K.  But seriously– the same number of yeas as abstentions?  That's horrible.  I'm glad Will is ruling with more of an iron fist.  I hope he fails a lot of the people who don't do anything or who barely do anything (that means you, Loren).  I'm finally through with that horrible khemysthree test!  Yes!  I thought I did pretty well, but I probably spelled my name wrong or used the old system of elements starting with Fi, Wi, Ea, Wa, and Lo (Fire, Wind, Earth, and Love, all noble gases).  But you've already heard those jokes ('cept for maybe Julia Kalow– speaking of which, don't you have anything better to do than read grubby little punk sophomores' blogs?).  Here's the tentative Matrix plan: Saturday, November 8 (this Saturday), we'll go to lunch at Cabot's (haven't eaten there in a while; aren't you tired of KFC?), then maybe the noon or 12:30 showing of Revolutions in Framingham, then maybe go to John or Richie's house (this could be in the beginning too) for GameCube/Monopoly.  I don't know who can come yet, besides me, John, and Loren, so tell me if you're free that day.  We'll probably have gotten tickets beforehand so we won't have to wait; it is opening weekend, after all.  Here is a couple of quotes that you'd know if you've read one of my profiles recently, the one from my "Academics" user account:  "I'm doing a white guy, I don't know if he's Jewish or not." ---Steph Kaplan  "I wish I had a white female Jewish aunt." ---Craig  Also, here's a passage from the very funny Steve Martin's "Pure Drivel":  "Once in Hawaii, I had sex with a hundred-and-two-year-old male turtle. It would be hard to argue that it was consensual. I would like to apologize to the turtle, his family, the Kahala Hilton Hotel, and the hundred or so diners at the Hilton's outdoor cafe. I would also like to apologize to my loyal wife Karen, who had to endure the subsequent news item in the 'Also Noted' section of the 'Santa Barbara Women's Club Weekly.'"

       Yeah, I know I haven't updated it in a while.  Sully told me to recently (Jsun 102 (5:46:58 PM): you've really been neglecting that blog of yours), and I was trying to procrastinate from studying for the stoichiometry quiz, so here goes:  I finally finished (and started) my Malcolm X project; I made like 20 different buildings from his life that were supposed to represent "stepping stones."  She could tell I put a lot of time into it, but I don't think she liked it... right afterward, she said to the class, "By the way, you don't have to discuss the entire plot, just a few major turning points," and I'm like "Have mercy..."  The others'... meh.  I know most of you aren't in my English class, but I'll tell you, I didn't find most all of them interesting.  Plus a few were slackers, but they were girls, so they'll obviously get As.  Ummmm.... what else....  Oh, I saw "Revolutions," it was as good as expected.  And Tupac.  That was kind of boring.  (Though I'm still a gangsta, yo.  East siiide!)  I think I might take the Martin Rotemberg approach to Mock Trials, running off for many roles.  Well, at least two.  Definitely Palmer.  Ian is so annoying.  First he refused to even look at my resolution at like 9:30 two nights ago (file-transfer), then he burned it in chemistry the next day.  Then he shook it to get the flame out, and some of the ashes barely missed the wooden table.  Read over your safety contract, Ian... you're not especially encouraged to play with fire...  I was talking to Loren at lunch the other day about the expression: "Oooohhh! Shot down!" and I noticed that you'd never use it literally... Like at a crime scene, and the detective asks, "What happened here?" and the coroner says "Ooooohhh! Shot down! By a .45!"  Anyway, the closing thing for today is a tie between Biggie and Mock Trials quotes, so here are both:  Check it, I grew up a feckin' screw up, got introduced to the game, got a ounce, and feckin' blew up. Choppin' rocks overnight. The nigga Biggie Smalls tryin' to turn into the black Frank White. We had to grow dreads to change our description. Two cops on the milkbox missin'. Runnin' from the police, picture that, nigga I'm too fat. I feck around and catch a asthma attack. But still I bust back, it don't phase me. When he drops, take his glock, and I'm Swayze. Summer break, my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight. Laid back, I got some money to make, motherfecker.  And now, for Mock Trials:  "There were more than one conclusions drawn." --- (Get ready for) Gaby  "A teacherly assigned assignment..." --- Luba  And finally, words of wisdom from my math teacher, Mr. Stanley:  "I'm gonna fool around and see if I get lucky."

       Grrr. People like Loren's blog more than they like mine. I don't know whether to change my writing style or keep it the way it is. Whatever, at least it schools Jason's "Xanga"... whatever the crap that means...  Speaking of Jason and Loren, this funny thing happened in Heidi yesterday... We're doing these art history stuff projects, and Loren's group had a poster with a naked chick on it, and I was like "Oooo, Loren," and he was like "What are you talking about?" and I pointed and he was like "Oh, yeah..." and Jason was like "Yeah, Loren helped with the gluing on that one..."  Loren and I were both kind of shocked, but I thought it was funny.  (If you don't get it, here's a hint: he would have been alone...)  Also speaking of Loren, his second-to-latest post is equally entertaining and personally grrring. Aside from the blatant spelling/grammatical errors (like "Which of You're Friends"), he was saying stuff like he lived on two continents (New Hampshire isn't a continent, Loren) and that he was in love with Melody (such a middle-school thing) and that I was least likely to get married (I don't see you getting any further than like less than hand-holding). Why I oughta...  Mock Trials party at my house yesterday, went comme ci comme ca, I presented a direct of Palmer (good, but people didn't like Steph Kaplan's lawyering and I kind of messed up on cross), a rabbi showed up asking for money, and then Elliott ruined my whole realpolitik plan to get a role. Ask me about this if you want to know my plan; whadayagannado.  Ummm, Thanksgiving was OK I guess, I was thankful for a lot of new TV (not on today, though!), kind of boring, and I have nothing but work to do over the too-short break.   And I don't know what I'm going to do with my strategy...

       This week has been kind of smeh.  No big goodnesses, no big badnesses.  The three people who know my information will understand the other meaning of the title.  Model UN was on Monday; this is the first issue in which I don't have a resolution since that poverty issue last year.  Matt K-K's resolution is just like all his others– spends a lot of money, takes years to fulfill, and does absolutely nothing.  HMUN (Harvard Model UN) is next week Thursday through Sunday, that might be fun, in a boring kind of way.  We'll see.  I'm going to have to work hard over the weekend to revamp my Palmer direct.  It's good as it is, but it needs a lot of work.  I don't know if I stand a chance against Martin and Hodes, I'll try to memorize it and be really simple on cross.  I could use your help, MT readers (btw, never say MT when referring to Math Team.  Mock Trials totally gang-rapes Math Team).  My studio production is tomorrow.  I'll let you see the tape when it's finished.  On Saturday, John, Jonny, Dan Waldinger and I are going to see "The Last Samurai."  Below is the plan:  2:30- arrive at Jonny's house (leave Stupid Team early)  3:00- leave for movie, driven by Jonny's dad  3:30- movie begins  5:45- movie ends... and then, who knows?   The following are "Celebrity Secrets" said by Ringo Starr on Conan:   "I remember when the Beatles broke up. I was the only one showing up for tour dates for two months when I finally put the pieces together!"  "Yeah, it was incredible, the drugs, the sex, the all- night parties. I really miss that Shining Time Station."  "Do I really miss all the girls screaming and chasing me? No, because I imagine it's still going on. And here they come!"

       Thursday post-school, Friday post-C-block, today, and tomorrow morning, I have and will have been at HMUN.  Along with Lauren Blanchard, I represent Lesotho in the Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Committee (SOCHUM).  I actually introduced an amendment that passed, pretty good considering how insignificant the country is.  Our topic is the death penalty.  We need to execute a good resolution (ha ha ha... no).  A few anecdotes:  In the car ride there, we were playing this game where we try to name countries that begin with the third letter of the previous country.  I had to do one with "R," and Russia, Rwanda, and Romania had already been said.  All I could come up with was "Roganda," and then I was like, wait a minute...  -Knock knock. -Who's there? -Interrupting cow. -Interrupting c -MOOOOO!  -Knock knock. -Who's there? -Interrupting llama. -Interrupting ll -(Head butt)  There was one motion for a song, that was good.  Also, after a point of personal privilege, the moderator asked, "How many people are hot... and I don't mean physically attractive..."  So I guess you had to be there.  Whadayagannado.  Model UNnecessary.  PS: Loren, you are so dead.

       OK, since people have been telling me that Loren's blog pwns mine (whatever that means), I think I'll respond with the American way-- by stealing stuff from his!  Anyway, this is a survey I found on Loren's blog.  The answers are mine though.  Enjoy.    *What do you most like about your body? My brain.  *And least? My "Jewish muscles" as Seth would say.  Though I pack a punch against smaller kids (you don’t want me to be your babysitter)  *How many fillings do you have? Three?  No idea.  Between zero and three.  *Do you think you're good looking? Oh yeah.  You want this.  *Do other people often tell you that you're good looking? You kidding?  "Were you or Lenny ever named People Magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive?"  "Well, I don’t know about Lenny..."   FASHION:  *Do you wear a watch? Yessir.  I used to have a watch that was so thin everyone thought it was fake.  And then it broke.  So it was.  *How many coats and jackets do you own? Two.  Winter and Fall/Spring.  *Favorite pants/skirt color? Uh, dark blue.  *Most expensive item of clothing? My diamond tiara, obviously.  No.  (Looking in closet...) Maybe my suitjacket.  My lone falling-apart suitjacket.  *What kind of shoes do you wear? Go Merrells.  I hadn’t tied my shoes in so long when I got boots for the Tanzania training mission, I practically forgot how (no laces).   YOUR FRIENDS:  *Do your friends 'know' you? Well.  Maybe Loren or John.  *What do they tend to be like? Um, what’s that supposed to mean?  The good ones are like John Kerry, the bad ones are like Aaron Burr.  *Are there traits in you that are universally liked? My girlish charm.  *How many people do you tell everything to? Depends what you mean by "everything."  Four people know my sensitive information.  I guess one, Loren.   GENERAL QUESTIONS:  *Who is the smartest man alive at the moment? Duh.  Me.  Matt Woolf is a far second.  *What do you prefer, a sunny or rainy day? Sunny.  I like rainy nights though.  *Do you consider yourself lucky? No such thing.  *Do you feel pity for people who commit suicide? Nossir.  The stupid can weed themselves out, though it is against the law (do I hear a bum BUM bum bum bum bum bum coming on?).  *Choose one word to describe how you feel most often: Tired.  *Do you own any plaid clothing? You betcha.  One of my favorite shirts (oh no, I’m turning into the pedophile again).  *Do you own converse shoes? I think we’ve gone over this.  *Do you own saucony shoes? I don’t have more than one pair of shoes, alright?  *Do you own old school nikes? I’m a white Jew...  *Do you wear tight pants? Likely story.  Jeans are the only way to go.

Not even in my cargos.  *Crush: I think four of you know the answer to that.  *Virgin: I would hope so.  *Natural hair color: Brown.  *Current hair color: I’m a Democrat; I’m not a punk.  *Eye color: Brown.  *Height: 5'4.5" at my last doctor’s appointment.  (Conan: How tall are you, anyway? John Tesh: I’m two meters.  Conan: Two meters?  How many kilos do you weigh?)  *Weight: 112 lbs.

(Blessed art thou, our Lord, King of the Universe who has brought bread from the field or some such.  Not actually as Christian as it sounds.)  *What is the last TV show you saw? Arthur.  One of the two good PBS shows.  *What is the last song you heard? Right now I’m listening to “Battle Flag” that they use on NBC promos and in the episode of ER where Carter got stabbed and shouted out but the song was so loud that no one could hear him.  Before that, “Fly Me to the Moon.”  Go iTunes.   WHO IS THE LAST PERSON YOU...  *Saw? One of my parents, both I guess.  *Kissed?

       Duke's blog needs some work.  That MIDI crap messes everything up.  And the post before last was Melody/Holdenesque, not cool.  Kind of interesting, though.  But the most recent post, lemme tellya, Taiwan is the real China, not a colony of Commie China, not Japan, and the Commies are too trying to bomb and invade and Shi'ite.  This vacation, all I've been doing is Mock Trials and going to movies and mainly sitting in front of my computer.  I ought to do something.  And my Burke direct needs serious work.  And I procrastinate so much.  And I should probably start my Heidi project.  And stop beginning sentences with conjunctions.  What else...  I don't know how much I should give away in my blog.  The last time I did, it was pretty obvious, even though Sully misinterpreted it.  Hmm.  It's not like they read it anyway, they aren't exactly big computer types as far as I can gather.  As I've said in a convo or too, it's fun talking about this stuff, because it's like The OC with all of these eternal issues and cliffhangers and such, the only difference is I never get any, if you know what I mean.  During vacation, though, there are few developments.  So anyway, stay tuned for a Burke revision if you're in Mock Trials (and know what you're talking about), and tell me if I should talk about the "stuff" on the ol' blogerino.

       I'm mostly happy:  1. The survey I posted got a good response.  If you haven't read it yet, look below.  2. I was going to fill out another one because of the first's popularity, so I got a separate one from Melody's livejournal; I was about 75% done with it when it got deleted.  Bah.  3. I finished the two essays (English and Heidi) that had been worrying me.  I think they turned out alright.  Ahhh, no more cramming.  4. No more school and no more work for a while.  Need I say more?  5. Yes, I so need.  According to Kaplan, my ski thing got a mixed response.  You probably don't know what I'm talking about, but lemme tellya, hmmmmm.  Maybe it's down to one.  We'll see.  6. Pretty much the only good thing I can do over the vacation other than skiing and partying with Richie and them is the Heidi year-long project.  Groan.  7. Mock Trials tonight lifted my humbug spirits.  I was tired out from all the schoolwork I've had recently, and vacation was looking not so good.  But then it was Mock Trials, and I was actively working on it, and it was fun.  Yay.  8. I inadvertently acted jerkily toward Jessica Li the other day.  It was in the morning, A-Block, the day of a math test, in math, and I was asking her some question about our English class or something.  She said she was taking the test, but that didn't really register, so I was like, "Whatever, just answer my question!"  Well, I don't think she minded that much.  And this is someone who thinks Guacamole is a country.  9. Matt Woolf wrote a seventeen-page essay on Cecil Rhodes for Heidi.  Mine is six pages, but it's all important.  His is probably a lot of crap and filler, but Heidi is just going to look at how many pages it is and get him an A-plus-plus-double-check-star (Loren).  Another Matt Woolf thing: I was thinking about the movie "21 Grams," and I was like, "Matt Woolf, you know everyone loses exactly twenty-one grams at the exact moment of his death?" and Matt was like, "Yes, they call it the weight of the soul..."  And that would have been enough but then he had to insert his Woolfiness: "...Even though it's mass."  And we had a good laugh.  10. Anyway, a gay-but-heterosexual christmukkah to all and to all a fair evening.

       Given the response to my last survey, I decided to take the questions from another survey from Loren's blog, which he probably got from someone else, and answer them.  Enjoy.  I see: My computer screen, with this window and my buddy list and a Notorious L.O.R. chat and part of my direct on which PJ commented. I need: Oxygen, nutrients, air pressure. I find: That I am a little thirsty but not at all hungry. I want: I'll save this answer for more to-the-point questions. I have: Several things. I wish: I don't really wish.  I plan. I love: Things- food.  Places- Boston, Cambridge, North, my room.  People- again, I'll save this for later. I hate: CompuUncoolGeoGorge, at times. I miss: One of my choices, when I learned that choice was otherwise occupied. I fear: Not much.  I just have concerns. I feel: Your mother last night.  Yeah, I know, that's kind of plagiarizing Loren.  Apathetic but a little jolly. I hear: Music. I smell: That kind of air smell that you smell when you're a little sick.  Hard to explain. I crave: Teriyaki chicken. I search: For academic performance and for some chickens.  Chickens...get it...chicks... I wonder: About my future in both spectra.  See above. I regret: The HMUN thing.  That's the only thing that comes to mind.  When was the last time you ...  Smiled: An hour ago, when I was with the New England Retired Decorated Salamander (acronym). Laughed: Then. Cried: Not for a long, long time.  Speaking of which, I was watching "L'Empire Contre-Attaque" on Quebecois TV in Vermont the other day, and in the beginning they were like "Une age longtemps, tres longtemps." Bought something: A few hours ago, for the French people. Danced: Eighth grade. Kissed someone: Many years, if you're talking about that kind of kissing.  This was back when I was a playa. Talked to an ex: Not really applicable, unless you're talking about what I was just talking about. Watched your favorite movie: I think like two years ago. Had a nightmare: Last night, but that doesn't really count.  We had to write a bunch of paragraphs during class for English in my dream, but then the teacher was talking and I wasn't writing that much and then the period ended.  I was just a little apprehensive.  A last time for everything ...  Last book you read: If you mean last book you finished, then Black Boy.  Right now I'm slowly reading "Rise to Rebellion" about the American Revolution and if I read it slowly enough I can bring it to France and flaunt my Americanism. Last movie you saw: "Paycheck," a few hours ago. Last song you heard: "Sit Down, John," from "1776." Last thing you had to drink: Coca-Cola.  I just wrote "Coca-Coca" by mistake and then fixed it. Last time you showered: I bathe... so not in a long time. Last thing you had to eat: This ice-creamoid dish.  Do you ...  Smoke: Not likely. Do drugs: Not since I had whooping cough, which I didn't. Have sex: Um...with other people?  Just kidding.  Not ever. Sleep with stuffed animals: No. Live in the moment: Not really.  I plan things the day before, but I still take the initiative when the time comes, even when it's unnerving.  Wait a minute, if you say "unnerving" shouldn't you say that you're "unnervous"? Have a boyfriend/girlfriend: Not yet. Have a dream that keeps coming back: No. Play an instrument: I used to. Believe there is life on other planets: Yes, there is probably life on at least a couple of other planets.  But in my opinion, it'd probably just be like one-celled amoebae that aren't very interesting. Remember your first love: Yes. Still love him/her: No.  That was a looooong time ago. Read the newspaper: Only the comics and the "Ideas" section in the Sunday paper. Have any gay or lesbian friends: I know people who I think might be gay. Believe in miracles: No.  Stupid Jesus. Believe it's possible to remain faithful forever: Yes, regardless about what you're faithful to.  But not if it's a change from something else. Consider yourself tolerant of others: Pretty much, if you're talking about race and ethnicity and sexual orientation and stuff.  But that doesn't mean I don't dislike people. Consider love a mistake: No.  We gots to propagate the species.  Go humans! Like the taste of alcohol: Does anyone? Have a favorite candy: Yes, Hershey's, but I haven't had any in a while. Believe in astrology: No.  Not by a long shot.  Bill Nye and Carl Sagan agree, it's a bunch of mumbo-jumbo that they make really vague so you can't disprove it.  That's like saying that God is the Father, the Son, AND the Holy Ghost.  Pick one and stick with it. Believe in God: Well, yes and no.  I'm a pantheist, which means that I believe in God but basically think that the universe is God.  I'm also a humanist. Pray: Jews don't really pray in the Christian sense.  Except Christianized Jews, like Reform Jews.  Daniel Waldinger, I'm looking at you. Go to church: I'm...Jewish... but I go to synagogue on holidays and I follow all of the stuff. Have any secrets: Not...really...not that is unique to me. Have any pets: Yes.  Go Hanne. Do well in school: Fairly well. Go to or plan to go to college: You bet your sweet diddy.  Whatever that means. Have a major: I'm in high school... but it's probably going to be something like pre-law or some historical or writing-related thing. Talk to strangers who instant message you: Nope.  Why do people have SmarterChild on their buddy lists? Wear hats: No sir or ma'am. Have any piercings: Those are so stupid.  Even for girls. Have any tattoos: Not by a long shot.  "You've spent more money on temp tattoos than on gifts for me!" "But Marge, it's worth it, check out the Taco Bell dog! What the?  Here boy!  Here boy!  Aw, it's gone." Hate yourself: Never myself specifically. Have an obsession: Not right now, but I have them from time to time. Have a secret crush: Is it secret if six people know? Do they know yet: You do realize that this category started out with "Do you..." so that makes this full question "Do you do they know yet."  Anyway, no SHE doesn't, you can never correctly use "they" when talking about one person, even if you don't want to be gender-specific.  But according to Kevin, "There is no change without action," so she should know by Monday the 12th. Collect anything: Non, as they say en France. Have a best friend: Like Loren, I don't really have a best friend, but I have a hierarchy of friends with a few top friends. Wish on stars: That's almost as bad as astrology or Christianity. Like your handwriting: No, but I like my signature. Have any bad habits: As Loren said, that's just being a guy.  I have some habits that are probably not ideal but they work for me. Care about looks: My own?  Somewhat. Boy/girlfriend's looks: Not...applicable... but I care about the looks of potentials. Friends and other people: No, not really. Believe in witches: Only that those Goths think they're really cool when they say "I'm a witch!  That's why I don't know how to dress!" Believe in Satan: I'm Jewish.  Not by a long shot. Believe in ghosts: No, but according to my reasoning, we have like a 30% chance of reincarnation.

       My new year's thing was alright, but not exactly ideal.  Although I decided not to talk about the specifics of my exploits in my blog, I'll say that I never saw her there.  Who here watches The OC?  They say that how you spend New Year's Eve is how you'll spend the rest of the year, so everyone on the show was rushing to kiss their significant other during the countdown.  I guess I'll spend the rest of the year hanging out with my father, aunt, and three-year-old cousin in a hotel-condo in Vermont.  Whadayagannado.  I had two very informal resolutions.  One, finish the first half of the history project that has been hanging over my head.  Two, get a date, with the main one in mind.  I'll let y'all know how they go, the second in sort-of vague terms.  Ask me online if you want some more explanation.  The France trip is just one month away.  Tomorrow my dad's getting me a camcorder so I can document the experience.  I'll show y'all the DVD when it's done; I've already finished pre-production.  Apparently there are a lot of French-Canadians in Vermont.  I heard a couple talking near the skiing.  And we got Quebecois TV in the hotel-condo.  I understood not that much of it.  But then I was watching one of the Africa episodes of ER tonight, and I understood every word of the French they spoke in the People's Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Whatever.  They all speak English.  Speaking of ER, I just got my late Christmukkah present, ER Season One.  It's pretty good so far; I've watched the first three episodes.  This was back when they had all white people but one (not that I care about that sort of thing, but as Frank says, "It's getting to look like the goddamn UN General Assembly in here).  It's not as good as the current ER, though.  The new ER is much better, with cool scenery and action and arms being cut off by helicopter blades and epidemics and such.  Noah Wyle only has nine more episodes.  Now I'm rambling.  There isn't that much more to say.  I'll see you all on Monday.  So much for vacation.  Oh yeah, and Richie's in Australia now.  G'day!

       I've been so bored lately.  That's why I've been updating a lot more often than I used to.  Pretty much all I have to do is my chemistry project.  Alone.  John said my last post (before the survey) was not good, not bad.  I don't know what to do to better it.  These days, I've only been writing events and issues I think about.  I guess if the issues themselves aren't juicy, the blog won't be.  There have been few homework assignments, but multiple big things, like the chemistry project and the history year-long thing.  So the result is that I'm both bored and anxious at the same time.  It's annoying how little happens as regards the plan during the week, and stops completely over the weekend.  If only I could call, this would be so much easier, but it doesn't work like that apparently.  Yesterday I gained my first new buddy in a long time, Jing.  Welcome to the buddy list.  As you can confirm by the last post, nothing is going on.

       Another survey.  They seem to be crowd-pleasers.  This one is from Melody's livejournal.  Enjoy.

Monodextrous. Zodiac sign? ::: Leo/Dragon, though Carl Sagan and Bill Nye agree that astrology is a load of horse feathers. Height? ::: 5'4.5" last time I checked, like a long time ago  [x] Part 2 -- Describe... [x]  Your heritage/nationality ::: Jewish and American, but not Jewish-American.  Stupid PC bastards... I mean ignorant publicly obedient illegitimate children... Your hair ::: Curly Your fears ::: Not getting what I want...in that arena... Your perfect room ::: Mine What you practically do in a day ::: What the crap does that mean?  Eat/sleep/watch TV/hang out online/homework.  [x] Part 3 -- What is/are... [x]  Words you overuse ::: "The." Phrases you overuse ::: "Oughn't it to be" Your first thought when you wake up ::: I'm tired, I want to go back to sleep Your greatest accomplishment ::: Bar Mitzvah, though we'll see how this role business turns out...and this other business Something you want to do ::: Her... haha jk.  Try a case.  [x] Part 4 -- This or that [x]  Pepsi or Coke ::: Coca-cola, but not cocaine McDonald's or Burger Kings ::: McDonald's Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera ::: Britney Spears.  Christina Aguilera is like the pony down at the petting zoo; everybody gets a ride.  Not to say that Britney Spears isn't the same way.  Not to say that I care. Chocolate or vanilla ::: Chocolate.  Vanilla is so... plain. Adidas or Nike ::: Merrells.  But if I had to choose, I'd say Adidas, because they're slightly less evil. Black or white ::: White.  Yeah, I know, I'm racist.  Not really, white is just a really simple color plus I have white pride. Bills or Coins ((Think $$$)) ::: Bills.  And a pound of flesh if I don't get repaid. Burgers or hot dogs ::: Hot dogs, but not Armor Hot Dogs.  What kind of kid eats Armor Hot Dogs? Egypt or France ::: I'll suck up to where I'm going in three weeks and say France.  Plus, Egypt is so hot. Rock or rap ::: Rap, but it depends on the song.  [x] Part 5 -- Do you...[x]  Smoke ::: Not one joint.  "But it's medicinal marijuana!  Prescription Pot!  Texas THC!" Cuss ::: Only damn, but not often, especially since there is no damnation in Judaism. Sing well ::: Not really, but I can rap like nobody's business. Sing in the shower ::: Not...applicable... Talk to yourself --a lot-- ::: Not out-loud.  Wait, is thinking the same as talking to yourself silently? Believe in yourself ::: Yes, though I have some doubts.  Go Dietzinator! Like taking these longass surveys? ::: I don't mind, especially when I'm bored and procrastinating from doing my chemistry project. Play an instrument ::: I used to, the piano.  I haven't really lost my touch, but I'd need to practice a song for a while to be able to play it.  I still use it to figure out TV themes, like the other day I was playing one of the themes to "The OC."  Best show ever, by the way. Want to go to college? ::: Yes. Want to get married? ::: Yes. Want to have children? ::: Yes. Think you're a health freak? ::: No, my immune system can handle anything.  I haven't stayed home sick for over a year, and that was involuntary (Kallikatsos thought I had whooping cough when I coughed once).  Get along with your parents ::: As much as any teenager does. Get along with your siblings? ::: Well enough. Think you're popular ::: Well...  [x] Part 6 -- In the past month have you..[x]  Gone out of state ::: Yes, to Vermont.

Done any drugs ::: Not even Motrin.  Well, I guess caffeine. Eaten an entire box of oreos ::: Oreos aren't really my thing. Been on stage ::: I've performed in front of several of my classrooms.  I have mad rap skillz. Gone skinny dipping ::: Not since the womb. Been dumped ::: Not in the past month... or ever really.  Although, I have been rejected in the past. Dyed your hair ::: No sir. Stolen anything ::: Well, I stole MY calculator from George's room.  [x] Part 7 -- Your friends! =D [x]  Craziest ::: Um... Charlie Mokriski. Loudest ::: All of my friends are pretty much the same volume.  But this smart girl who sits next to me in history is louder than a yodeler with a shofar. Most shy ::: I would say Loren, but he gets some (non-existent) action, so I'd better keep my mouth shut.  John Garabedian. Blondest ::: Yin-yin (Ian). Smartest ::: You're readin' at him... but I guess Matt Woolf. Kindest ::: Ahhh... but she doesn't really count as a friend.  Richie, before he left. Best personality ::: John. Most talented ::: I guess Jonny; he's good at making those graphs and such.  But my friends have so few talents. Best singer ::: None of them sing, so I'll just say Kevin because he watches a lot of BET. Most ghetto ::: Kevin. Drama Queen ((or King XP)) ::: Melody, I think she might say that I'm not her friend, though. Pain in the ass ::: Ian. The one you just want to strangle to death ((Homer Simpson style))::: Ian. Funniest ::: John.  I laughed out loud when he was talking to me the other day, and I rarely do that sincerely. Best person for advice ::: Jason Shen.  Sorry, Loren, but he deserves the title. Trustworthy ::: It USED to be Loren... I'll just say Jason Shen. Druggie ::: Haha, Will, but he's not my friend.  Jing seems a little drugular, but I guess she's just apathetic. Most likely to end up in jail ::: Loren, he has no regard for the law, plus he'd probably take the fall for whoever is his girlfriend when he's old enough to go to a real prison. Person you've known the longest ::: Brian Liu, but we haven't talked except a few times online since he moved to Andover.  [x] Part 8 -- The Last... [x]  Last dream ::: I don't recollect... but a couple days ago I dreamed I was in English and we had to write two paragraphs during class and I ran out of time... and then yesterday or the day before we had to do that same thing in history for real. Last nightmare ::: See above, though I was just a little agitated. Car ride ::: To school yesterday, at 6:20 in the morning for that Tanzania thing... in which nothing happened... Last time you cried ::: Never in my memory. Last movie seen ::: Paycheck, with Jonny, John, and Loren. Last movie rented ::: Uh... I bought ER Season One a while ago... Last book read ::: I'm still reading "Rise to Rebellion."  So slowly. Last word said ::: "Yeah." Last curse word said ::: "Damn." Last time you laugh ::: LaughED.  Yesterday, walking home with Dan Shir again. Last phone call ::: With a telemarketer for one of them Indian things.  She asked if I was Mr. Dietz, and I said yes because technically I was, but then I panicked and hung up. Last CD played ::: "Liberty! The American Revolution." Last song you listened to ::: "Jenny from the Block" from my blog.  Whoa.  "Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the blog." Last annoyance ::: George, marauding last night. Last IM ::: With Jason Sullivan about Mock Trials. Last weird encounter ::: With her... ask me about it if you want to know. Last person you hugged ::: I don't really hug. Last person you yelled at ::: Loren, to tell Matt Woolf that he signed my contract so that Matt could witness it. Last time you wore a skirt ::: Not...applicable... Last time you've been evil ::: I probably shouldn't have done what I did to that telemarketer.  They are people too. Sarcastic? ::: Probably yesterday, I'm usually sarcastic at school. Last time you fought with your parents ::: I was arguing with my mother on Thursday when we had to get the stuff for the Tanzania thing. Last time you wished upon a star ::: So stupid a thing to do.  Never. Played Truth or Dare ::: I know I have played it in the past, but I can't remember the last time. Spent quality time alone ::: Right now.

Ever TP'd someone's house ::: No. How about egging someone's house ::: Nope. Do you not like dislike not like me? ::: Yes, I dislike you. Ain't Eminem and 50 Cent just fine? ::: I don't mind them. Yo Momma ::: Yo What? Ever been so hungry you felt like you could eat the person next to you? ::: No, the last cannibalistic thought I had was wanting to eat Jar Jar Binks during Episode I.  He looked like he tasted like chicken.  Oh wait, he wasn't human. What do you think of George Bush? ::: He's an alright person I guess, but not a great president. Any secret fetishes? ::: No. Do you like to wear chains? O_o ::: I'm Jewish. How many languages do you speak? ::: Two alrightly.  And I can understand biblical Hebrew somewhat. Damn.. are your fingers tired? Cause mine sure are! ::: Yeah. Glad this is over? ((Say yes and I'll stalk you XP)) ::: Relieved, I guess.  Congratulations if you've read this far.  I'll update when something new happens.

       What I was hoping would happen today did not happen.  Nothing happened with that thing.  And don't try to pin this one on me, there were no opportunities.  I really have to get my head in the game, though, at least when it comes to class.  Judging by a few sources and some events that happened, I think I might actually have a shot, though. Nevertheless, it's going to be tough getting the dynamic ready by Thursday.  I've been shooting a little video for my movie.  It's going pretty well.  I came off as either smart or nerdy in math today.  I was explaining to Mr. Stanley (irreverently, as always) that he had put QED where he should have put QEF.  Most of the class had never heard of that.  But class itself was really relaxed and fun.  She wasn't there to witness my irreverence and intelligence, though.  Today in chemistry, we had a free, but we were supposed to be in the library (so we were).  I hung out at a table in one of those rooms with Ian, Matt Woolf, Melody, Melanie Joubanian, and Jing.  Ian and Woolfy mostly played on Ian's palm pilot; before we had listened to some music on it like that Leidenstadt song, to which I sang along.  Apart from a couple very short games of go, pretty much all I did was watch Mel, Mel, and Jing talk girl talk and look through a People Magazine.  Melody said that I shouldn't talk about her with other people, which was a little annoying because she talks about me with other people.  Oh well, I guess I won't hold it against her.  These days I've been talking about the Lor/Mel relationship almost half as much as I've been talking about my own designs.  The way I justify this without sounding stalkerish is that if I were the US, then it would be in my national interest to observe the foreign affairs of Britain and its girlfriend France.  Plus, it's good gossip.

       The song currently playing is Jennifer Lopez's "Jenny from the Block" featuring Ja Rule or some such Rule.  So anyway, I didn't execute the plan today.  The dynamic just wasn't ready.  It might be by next Thursday, though, especially with this thing that's happening tomorrow.  It's actually possible that I'm beginning to lean towards the other one, I don't know.  Jason Shen is so wise.  Apparently Ms. Heidlage knows of this novel with the last word being "Hunger" by someone named "Unger."  I think she got it wrong.  We finished "Au Revoir les Enfants" today.  I wrote down all of the...suggestive...language:  "And appeared naked as she was born."  "Each coupling the wildest fornication."  "She had the narrow passage of a Chinese girl."  "He probed her intimate depths and found she was a virgin pearl."  Hope you enjoyed those.

       I've been really tired this school week.  But I can't go to sleep before midnight or so.  I guess I'll just suck it up.  The song playing right now is "Changes," by Tupac Shakur, by the way.  I'll "change" it when the site from whence it came comes back up.  I think I'll postpone my plan until next Thursday.  It's just not ready yet.  I got my camcorder.  It's pretty cool, but there are still a few kinks to work out.  That's about it.  There's little happening these days.  Adios, muchachos.

       You have probably noticed that I have reformatted my blog.  Pretty cool, huh?  Here are a few of the changes:  New Format - New colors, proportions, fonts, for a better blogging experience.  Music - A soundtrack to your window into my weblife.  Mail - A mailto link on the right-hand side of the page for immediate contact with Mr. Dietz himself.  Dannon Quotes-on-the-Bottom - Alternating quotes or other musings running on the bottom of your window (usually the "status" bar).  Links - Expanded linkage to the coolest sites on the "interweb."  I hope you enjoy your visit.  Keep it real.

       So, everyone:  I got a role in Mock Trials.  I'm doing the direct examination of Lee Burke (Matt Zimmer).  This means that, although I'll be in France for most of the trials, I'll conduct the direct in most of the scrimmages and at least one of the trials, and my direct will probably be used at trial.  Looks good for college.  I'm kind of excited about France, even though it's not for twenty-six or so days.  I'm getting a camcorder to make a movie of the trip; Mme Engborg said not to bring a laptop, I probably won't need one.  I'm going to be living in the 13th Arrondissement, a "Rather ugly modern Chinese and Vietnamese quarter with many good, cheap Chinese restaurants," according to my guidebook.  Apparently, my aunt knows somebody who owns a restaurant there.  I'll talk more about this when it's closer to the trip.  My French host guy is never online, though.  School has begun again, I'm not too down; I just don't like having to think about long-term work.  Speaking of which, I should really do some of those commentaries... later.  ER Season One is really good.  I would recommend it.  And I even have time with no MUN today and little homework (I was already done at five even after watching an entire episode this afternoon).  That's just about it.  Here's a quote from today's history:  "Those who were buried... were buried!" ---Ms. Heidlage

       So here's what's been happening yesterday and today:  I got a checking account today for France.  Pretty cool, I get my own checks and everything, though they don't say my name.  And my mother has like complete control, grrr.  There's a Mock Trials meeting tomorrow, and I want to virtually finalize my direct before then.  This means that if Matt Zimmer is reading this, get your head in the game.  I would post my direct, but I know how much enemy MT-ers read my blog coughJuliaRindlercough.  Things have transpired as regards the thing, but I've pretty much stopped waiting.  Either things are going to happen, or I'm going to take the initiative again.  And Loren was even disapproving of that style, but time is running out, and things will happen soon to restore the natural order.  I love inside jokes.  To finish off, here's one more inside joke and two Ken "I don't do anything at Mock Trials" Zhao quotes from Model UN:  Mack Ryan Records's new marketing drive: milk boxes with "Get Ready for Jody!" on the side.  Ken Zhao: "...namely, uh, some countries."  Ken Zhao: "We have a lot of Buddhists in our country, and, uh, Buddhists are very important because, uh, they are very religious."

       Nothing happened today in that arena.  I was going to do something, but then Ian messed me up with conversing about some stupid thing.  So that ruined my original plan; the floor plan wasn't conducive anyway.  I was going to try again after lunch, and left lunch a little earlier to go hang out outside of French.  I was talking to Melody, Emily, and later Ian and Loren there, who were all goading me to go over and do it.  But there was such a big crowd, and I only saw that she was by herself for like less than a minute - and even then she was right next to like three other people - so I didn't think that it would work.  In my planning, I had always pictured there being very few other people around.  It just doesn't work when there's that much commotion.  Today wasn't really the right day anyway.  It didn't feel right.  I hadn't even checked out the Living Arts section since I was in a big hurry this morning because I hadn't studied for a vocab quiz.  Anyway, I think I'll try a calm, anticlimactic thing, but I'm not saying when or where since I don't want to be goaded or like have a prepared audience.  I'll let you know the result.  Otherwise, I was actually OK in gym today, i.e., I tried (but failed multiple times) and our team actually won.  It's still not going to make a difference, since we are not going to get the highest score, and one free does not really matter that much.  Both examinations today were easy.  Also, I don't know whether Melody's latest post was supposed to be me-bashing in that line that was mentioned, but cut it out; I know you find my stuff interesting.

       It was a half day today.  French at the beginning of the day was... different.  I empathize with John, as I couldn't get to the one for half the free time because of studyingness.  And then I didn't use the rest of the time, because I thought I could use it to my favor another way: by joking with Ian so as to show off myself... I guess you had to be there.  Like my Adam Brody picture?  It's meant to make you think I'm him, like Loren's David Beckham.  Anyways, we watched this moderately funny movie where it's like these teens who are going on a date using everyday vocabulary and then all of a sudden this espion (spy) comes out with this magazine called "L'Observateur" with a little see-through window in it.  Not realistic.  So anyway, after the other two classes, I went to KFC with John, Jonny, Craig, and Dan Jung.  Loren showed up there with Pedophile McGee.  As Stephanie Kaplan might say, it was sooooooo cold.  Loren left his bag there; we're going to have to go back and get it.  So I was talking to Melody on the phone for a while, partially about my own exploits (romantic and otherwise), and how you can't love someone you see as ugly, and whether or not you have to want to procreate with someone to love them (I was on the pro-procreation side).  According to Melody, D-Day should be tomorrow (as it says in "upcoming events"), but then she said that she said that just because she thought it would be entertaining to watch.  Some of her comments can get annoying from time to time... not that one, but like saying that everyone hates me.  Ah, well, I guess I'll just brush them off; although trying to ignore remarks are like trying to wash stink off a monkey (not really, I just like farm-animal metaphors).  Here are a few quotes that happened today:  "Aw, crap, this is terrible for me! How am I going to launch myself?" ---Loren Chen  "I was not underneath you!" ---Jonny Kalow  About going after girls: "It'd be so much easier, but they have like feelings and crap." ---John Garabedian

       Ken Zhao e-mailed me about my Ken-Zhao rant.  Darn, I didn't know he read my blog.  Darn, he's probably reading it now...  Oh well, I don't take anything back.  Today was eventful.  First, in AM Gym, we played volleyball, and the ball came to me a couple of times and I panicked and dodged it.  Sorry, Melody (who is on my team); at least we're set to earn our team name, the Losing Mongooses.  Yeah, like we would win against all the other teams anyway, even without me, who cares?  Anyway, afterward, I was explaining what happened to Alex Turner and Ian, telling them "At least when I go on the French Exchange I'll have something in common with them [the French]: cowardice."  Next, in math, I got into a couple of relatively heated arguments with Mr. Stanley.  First, we debated whether we could assume something and then arrive at something that we know to be true to prove the thing that we assumed.  Second, he was doing this problem one way, but I knew it would get complicated and confuse everyone, so I was like, "No, Mr. Stanley.  Just no."  And then a few steps later, sure enough, it had gotten complicated and confusing, so I said, "See, you've dug yourself into a hole already!" and he said "No I haven't!" in a high, squeaky voice.  Anyway, once his long-winded process was finished, he let me come up and solve the problem simply and in a single step.  He said, "Brilliant, Alex."  I can never detect sarcasm so I don't know whether or not he was sincere.  In English, I had the opportunity to sit next to her, but I decided not to because of the Principle of Adjacency, which is that if I do sit next to her, I have to be adjacent to a boy or a boy-like person (i.e., Stephanie Kaplan, because we talk to each other easily).  I may have made the wrong decision; we only have one free-seating class left before the planned date, so that may not be enough.  And there is a timescale issue, especially since I'm going to be gone for a month beginning at the end of the month.  As I talked about with Ian during lunch, and as I observed during English and French, I've definitely decided on the one being the person I'm going after, despite past leanings the other way.  I like using the Law & Order analogy: you see the defense attorney come up and make an elaborate case with clever maneuvers and brilliant strategy, and you think wow, this guy is so obviously right.  But then Executive A.D.A. Jack McCoy stands up, and brings your eyes back to the simple, inalienable truth: that the defendant committed a murder, and that the jury has a duty to find him guilty for the sake of justice and the state.  It's the same thing with my saga, the other makes a big show (at least in my mind), but then the one comes up and makes it crystal clear that she is whom I want.

       According to Julia Kalow, the posts of the new style are not as enjoyable or cool as they used to be.  I'm not about to revert based on the opinion of one reader, but for a special treat, I've decided to present my rant about why I dislike Ken Zhao:  Boy, am I sick of Ken Zhao.  He begins Newton North all cocky, pretending he's going to run off for every role in Mock Trials.  I say to him, frosh rarely ever get roles, to say nothing about more than one.  He says, "I'm Ken Zhao!"  Great argument, Ken.  Then, it turns out he only runs off for one role, because he doesn't actually want to do the work, so he just BSes this horrible direct with - surprise surprise - another Asian freshman, Amy Chen.  He didn't bother to work with anyone else on the team, because he's so proud of himself that he thinks he can BS a fantastic direct without using the counsel of his teammates AND without working hard at all.  Hello, Ken, Mock Trials is a team, not a test-your-weight booth at the circus.  He didn't even learn the rules, so he couldn't answer objections.  He was just like, uhhh....  Ken thought he was above preparation.  So, shock of the century, he doesn't get the role, so now he thinks he doesn't have to contribute to the team; as I said earlier, he doesn't really get the concept that teammates are supposed to support each other, not compete with each other and then do nothing once one was decided to be better for a role.  He says absolutely nothing during meetings, has said nothing this entire year except during the direct itself and when Elliott asked him a question once near the beginning of the year (he didn't have much of an answer).  He doesn't read the case, he doesn't know the rules, he doesn't participate in meetings, and he certainly doesn't work on anyone else's examinations.  Yesterday, he didn't even come for the mandatory amount of time during the meeting, and had no excuse.  In conclusion, Ken Zhao is a lazy, cocky, unhelpful slacker who clearly attends Mock Trials for the credits alone; and he barely does the minimum, which is just to show up.  If you aren't going to make a significant contribution to the team --- or any contribution whatsoever, in Ken's case --- then don't take up space in our room or in the courtroom.

       Transition Fever!  I am updating this even though nothing has happened because Melody wants me to.  And sorry, Melody, for mentioning you and therefore ruining your reputation (as an uncool person, by being associated with such a cool person).  That's just the way the song is sung.  Speaking of songs, notice the new song, "You Don't Know My Name" by Alicia Keys.  It fit my situation so well like two weeks ago.  Too bad it doesn't fit anymore.  This was changed based on Jing's counsel, tell me if you want me to change it back to one of those teen angst songs.  I was feeling immoral, having stolen Loren's song, so I felt I had to change it.  Speaking of immorality, I took John's hell test and got into Limbo, as a "Virtuous Unbeliever."  I don't know how much value I should place on this because 1) Christianity is such a load of BS and 2) Loren also got into Limbo.  Now Melody's going to try to convert me, she's such a shicksa and I heard that she was trying to "save" Kevin a while ago.  Speaking of Melody, there was some funny stuff said in a convo between John and me today that included her.  This inclusion was when I was sending John an mp3 and he was saying it was so slow, and I was like "but at least it's constant... unlike Melody."  JK.  He didn't get it, though.  Another good quote taken out of context is me saying "I love ankle porn."  You can judge for yo'self.  Speaking of ebonics (and ergo, race), I really think there ought to be a White Culture Club.  If there can be an Asian Culture Club and a Jewish Culture Club and a Black Leadership Council, the list goes on, why can't white people have a place to meet and celebrate their civilization's achievements?  Such clubs shouldn't just be for minorities; Asians are the most plentiful people in the world.  You might counter (as John did), we already have Presidents' Day and Veterans' Day and Columbus Day, etc., so why do we need more?  Well, those are not white holidays.  Those are AMERICAN holidays, and whites and blacks and Asians and Jews in this school are all Americans.  Speaking of political correctness, I am so sick of feminism.  I don't care who hears me, I'm going to say "sportsmanship" and "actress" and "chairman" now and forever.  The "actress" one really gets me, it's like they need to masculate themselves by using the masculine form, lowering the female gender for everybody.  Speaking again of political correctness or lack thereof, here's a politically incorrect quote from an episode of The OC to end things:  Seth: Yeah, well, I'm sure everyone will be so accepting seeing as how we're such a liberal, tolerant bunch.  And that was at the expense of Orange County, not Luke's dad.  Who's a big, gay dad.

       I finally got my braces off today.  But now I have to wear this stupid retainer.  I'm practically unintelligible and really annoying when I talk.  If the French couldn't understand me before, they certainly won't be able to understand me now.  Just three more months, then I won't have to wear it in school anymore.  Stephanie Kaplan says I should be a rebel and only wear it at night.  Yeah, a rebel with bad teeth who'll have to wear braces again.  I've decided to table the main effort of my plan for at least a couple of months, for a variety of reasons.  I may pursue the other option, though.  Elliott said yesterday that we should talk on the phone to discuss my performance as "The natives are restless."  I agree that my direct on Tuesday was horrible, but Thursday was a real improvement.  Unfortunately, Elliott wasn't in the room at the time.  He still hasn't called.  But now he certainly has stuff to complain about, given that I can't talk with this goshforsaken retainer.  Here are a few politically incorrect Ben Fong jokes:  Silly Negro, Trix are for kids!  -------------------  -What's the difference between a pile of dead babies and an old Pontiac?  -I don't have an old Pontiac in my garage.  -------------------  -How do you fit a hundred Jews in a car?  -Put two in the front, three in the back, and 95 in the ashtray.  -------------------  -What do you call a hundred white people running down a hill?  -An avalanche.  -What do you call a hundred black people running down a hill?  -A mudslide.  -What do you call a hundred Mexican people running down a hill?  -A jailbreak.  -------------------  -A black man and a Mexican are in a car.  Who's driving?  -The police.  -------------------  -Why doesn't Cuba ever win in the Olympics?  -Because all the Cubans who can run, swim, or jump are in the United States.  -------------------  -How do you get the population of Mexico?  -Roll a nickel down the street.  -How do you get the richest man in Mexico?  -Whoever catches the nickel.

       Sorry I haven't updated in almost a week; there's been a lot of stuff going on.  Tuesday and today I had scrimmages.  Tuesday I was PRETTY DARN HORRIBLE but the other team sucked so badly so I didn't look as bad.  Today I was decent, I was fairly good at articulation and whatnot on direct, and I only lost one one minor objection during direct.  During cross, I objected several times and a few were sustained; then I was not that excellent because I was flustered because I had no time to prepare, as there is a very short window for objections.  Plus, I missed a few opportunities.  But overall, I was much improved from Tuesday (when I was inaudible, missed an important piece of testimony, and didn't object at all), and fairly decent.  I certainly will not get a score perfectly comparable to Martin or Graham, but it was very good for me.  On Wednesday, I was sick, I had two tests which I hadn't studied for because I got home from Mock Trials (in Walpole) at 8:30.  Speaking of which, here's a little story about what happened after Walpole:  I needed a ride home from Walpole, but there was also a plan to go out to dinner, and I wanted to do that.  So I went over to the car I came in to get my bag with Matt Zimmer, but then I learned that that car wasn't going to dinner.  I looked around for Matt, but he had already gone to another car and I didn't see where he had gone.  So I walked around the parking lot alone, and saw that another car was on; it was Elliott's (the lawyer-coach's).  Matt Zimmer was in it; Elliott said that he was going to the restaurant but that he didn't have enough room, and to go check the third car.  They also didn't have enough room, so Elliott said to go to the car I came in again... they had left without me.  Finally, I went back to Elliott's car, and he put Matt in the front on the center console.  Later in the car I said, "Matt, sorry in advance if you die."  Someone asked Elliott what legal ploy he would use if he got pulled over; he said "The Doctrine of Necessity."  I don't know if that's real or not.  So we drove around, (during our driving we learned that the dinner plan was canceled) and Elliott took us to see the brand-new South.  It was stupefying.  There were such huge buildings everywhere.  Their gymnasium building was much bigger than ours.  Their science wing was bigger than our entire school.  And we could see that it was all modern and state-of-the-art, with internet in every classroom, offices for every teacher, and a student lounge on every floor.  Do we even have a student lounge, or any breathable offices?  I still argued that North was better, since it isn't the building that makes the school.  But DAMN.  Anyway, back to my missing school on Wednesday, I missed two tests that I am now going to take on Monday.  Four more days to study, that's pretty good.  Also, because I'm missing a couple of hours of school tomorrow, along with my "sickness" (though I plead the fifth), the Cold Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, two weekends, a trial, and the lack of E-block on Tuesdays, come Monday I will have had half of one history class in ten days.  Whoa.  The only other thing that's happening is that right after next weekend, I'm going to France.  I still haven't been able to contact my host family for over a month.  As the French would say, c'est mauvais.  Well, I'll see them when I get there.  To finish up, here are a few quotes from various places:  "I'm sorry I'm not a man." --- Melody Lun  "What was this for?  What was the big message that I was supposed to walk away from?" --- Ms. Heidlage  "I mean, he gets into the Jeep and he tries to drive it.  It's very hilarious." --- Ms. Heidlage  Oh, and here are a few things I wrote down when Ms. Heidlage was explaining Chinese dialects, which are orally unintelligible, and the differences between the Wade-Giles and the Pinyin transliterations, in which "Ch'" becomes "Q," "Ts" becomes "X," and "Zh" is pronounced like the first consonant in "Jacques."  By the way, Loren claims to speak Mandarin (that'll be useful information for the third thing).  -"X-mas" in Pinyin would be changed to Wade-Giles's "Ts-mas."  -Users of the Pinyin system, while in France, would say "Zhe m'appelle Alex."  -In response to "They [Mandarin-speakers] would not understand the words 'thank you' [in Cantonese.]":  Loren: Here's some bread.  Cantoner: Thank you.  Loren: HOW DARE YOU???!!!

       Also, a few things Hiro wanted me to mention:  He keeps saying all this stuff about how he wants to see the sunrise with Jonny Kalow, and know his shirt size so he can knit a sweater for him, and hold him tight.  His homoerotic ramblings further include the following quote: "Homosexuality is not the same as femininity."  Thanks for clearing that up for us, Hiro.

       Last night and this morning were fun.  I went out with my parents and their friends for dinner at this Italian restaurant in Waltham near the Embassy.  The food wasn't great, but the conversation was really entertaining.  We talked mostly about politics and synagogue society.  Very cool, I definitely made the right decision in going.  I was going to continue this coolness by watching back-to-back episodes of Law & Order: Criminal Intent, but then I started talking to Hiro on AIM and then on the phone about a much more pertinent and important issue: Mock Trials.  We had to revise it a little bit based on PJ's advice.  We were going to go over it more in depth, but Hiro had to finish his closing.  He asked, "How late are you staying up?"  I said "Until whenever."  Little did I know that would determine my next five hours.  To pass the time waiting for him to finish, I watched ultralate, syndicated episodes of The West Wing and ER, the former of which was really good.  Then, I worked on my direct, addressing objections top to bottom.  While talking to Hiro, he kept offering to do it at the meeting the next day so I wouldn't have to stay up so late, but I wanted to finalize the direct once and for all.  Plus, I kind of like being awake when I shouldn't be for a glorious cause.  As I was saying to Kevin online, who was up to write some astonishingly boring English essay, I feel like I'm in an airport.  Whenever I travel, I have to wake up earlier than normal.  When I go to the airport, there's always a lot of things going on around me, and I'm somewhat interested in them, but I'm still kind of out of it.  If all goes well, pretty soon Hiro will finish his closing, he'll hear my finalized Burke, we'll work on memorization etc. of Burke and Faulkner.  As you can see by the timestamp, it's almost four in the morning.  At least two good things have or will have come out of this:  1. My direct and my performance thereof are or will be airtight.  2. I now have a great new way to start anecdotes: "As I was saying to Hiro in bed the other night..."

       Notice the new picture.  Seemed a little more pleasant.  At the 4.5-hour plaintiff meeting yesterday, we completely overhauled the direct.  I really need to work on objections, though.  I was saying how the beginning of the plaintiff closing was a little corny, so Martin made up the following alternative on the spot:  "Imagine a little boy wakes up on Christmas morning.  He finds a brand-new bike under the Christmas tree.  But it isn't finished, he has to put it together.  So, after three long hours of assembling it, it's finally all built, but there's one piece missing: the handlebars.  That's because another kid stole them because his dad told him to.  Your Honor, Jody Sarak is that little boy, and Professor Chervy is the dad.  Thank you."  Mock Trials is all that's been happening lately.  Everyone always IMs me asking if anything happened, and I give them the same answer.  I just don't know what to do, but for some reason I don't really care as much anymore.  There's all this stuff hanging over my head, mainly the year-long history project and the test on Wednesday.  Oh, and you might have noticed that I've been saying "htg" instead of "gtg."  This is not a typo.  I don't like how people say "got" instead of "have," so I've decided to do my part to change things around.  We'll see how that goes.  I wrote my Julien-Legrain redaction.  I'm not going to post it, at least until after both sections turn them in, to avoid plagiarism, but here's what happens: Julien and Legrain argue over Jews and Communism, then this American guy comes and starts arguing about how the US saved the French and the Resistance didn't do anything.  I don't know, I guess you have to read it to find it funny.  Then again, it isn't funny.  Eh.  I figured I couldn't end on an "eh," so I'll post the lyrics to the song that's playing so you can sing along.  If it's already finished by now, just refresh the window, or tell me if I should make it loop.  "So I Fall Again" by Phantom Planet (the same band as the one that wrote The OC's theme song)  I can't say if this feeling coming over me is real, But I know it's something you can't steal, So I'll buy another problem to approach,  Sell a virgin lie that can't be touched.  [Chorus:] So I fall again, So I fall again, So I break through this rotten piece of wood, Again.  I can't say if this here f*cking subject should be dropped, But I know it's something you can't stop, So I'll buy another pick-up line and sigh, And pretend that everything is alright.  [Chorus]

       New song, "The Way We Get By" by Spoon.  Less yelling.  It's on the new soundtrack from The O.C.  Nothing has happened since I last posted, but I should say some new quotes:  "I've just been informed by other history teachers that I'm crazy." --- Ms. Heidlage  "If yu don't remember who you are, I will tell you." --- Ms. Heidlage  "I have no ovaries." --- Jason Sullivan

       Today was my last day of school before I leave.  It was fairly good.  I shot a lot of video for the movie I'm making about the exchange.  I ended up keeping ten interviews, with: Matt KK, Will McLoughlin, Jacob Fleming, Mr. Stanley, Eli Raffeld, Loren, Jason Shen, Dan Shir, Matt Woolf, and Melody.  It's going pretty well, and it's pretty entertaining.  Nothing else really happened today, except I aced the English quiz and the history quest.  Ms. Heidlage said that whenever there are exchanges, she has the class ask the kid a bunch of questions about what will have happened, and then when he gets back, he answers them; but we took the quest so I was never asked.  I have somewhat gimongo assignments in history, English, and math, but they look manageable.  I have nothing else to say.  Go System of a Down.

       Mock Trials last night was fun.  Elliott came in, and the first thing he said was something along the lines of "I guess Dedham didn't want Alex Dietz to get to do anything."  We didn't do anything in which I participated, except very sparsely... WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY FOR SOME PEOPLE COUGHSTEPHANIEKAPLANCOUGH oh wait she did do stuff, but not in the room; Hilana then.  Matt Zimmer and I spent like fifteen minutes running around the school looking for working vending machines with good drinks in stock that would accept money, we ended up settling for Hawaiian punch, which is pretty good, although John says that Ben Fong's parents forbade him from drinking that because it's racist.  Today was my last French before I leave, it was pretty good.  I was writing stuff in big letters on my paper and then holding it up so I could communicate with Ian (across the room).  Mme DeRobert never even noticed.  Melody doesn't always know when things should not be said.  Tomorrow, I plan to shoot a lot of video for my French movie, about like leaving Newton.  Stay tuned, I'm planning to interview six students not counting me or George.  Read on for a survey, stolen from Loren but also from Melody and whoever Margaret is (Melody's Lesbian lover... whoa, the first time I typed this I accidentally wrote "mother").

       Right now I'm typing from inside the school library at North.  For some reasons, librarians don't seem to monitor computers anymore.  Today was supposed to be the day of my first and only trial (unless we make it to nationals), given that I'm leaving for France on Monday.  But Dedham, our competitors, canceled because of the snow.  Now, both Matt Zimmer and I will have gotten roles but not participated in any trial- and I didn't even get kicked off my role!  At least I devised and revised the direct examination that will be used at trial.  I've had the same substitute like four times, Mr. Boris.  He's pretty cool, his mother is from the South so he says "y'all," he has a goatee, and he's only subbing for the cash, not because he wants to be a teacher.  In chemistry yesterday, he was going to let us out only ten minutes early, but I deftly negotiated for us to have the entireties of second AND third lunch, even on a long block with fifteen minutes between lunches.  All I had to do was my four raps, by Tupac, Biggie, and Chris Parnell, respectively.  I could tell everyone liked them.  Where the crap is Loren?  He doesn't seem to be here today, even though he was online just last night.  Maybe he has strep throat; he said that he has never missed school with a temperature lower than 102, and Ms. Heidlage said there's a lot of strep going around.  Oh, you know what?  He must have gotten an STD after being raped repeatedly by Sally.  That explains it.  Speaking of rape, a group was discussing statutory rape in history today (with Ms. Heidlage listening), and the following dialogue resulted:  Gabe: There are some countries where the age of consent is like, thirteen. Charlie: That's awesome!  When I told this to Ian and Matt in our chemistry-free today, we got into a bit of an argument about whether Ian looks at child porn.  Ian was like "I do not look at child porn!  Anyways..." and I mocked "I do not look at child porn!  Anyways, I was looking at child porn the other day, and..."  I also said that I would put the following misconstrued quote on my blog, and I'll stay true to my word: "I...look at child porn!" (the ellipsis replaces "don't")  I talked to the French guy online yesterday.  He seems OK, but he makes a bunch of mistakes.  Also, he talks in British English, not American English, saying stuff like "I hadn't the internet for a month."  Whadayagannado.  Will says I can't vote by proxy while in France, but he was a little ambiguous about it.  I might be able to.  France is just five days away...

       Hey, y'all.  I dunno what to type.  Right now I'm at John's house with the guys - Dan Jung, John, Ian, Kevin, and Loren.  I'm a little concerned that Loren hasn't been spending enough time with Melody in the last like month.  I spend more time with him, and I only see him an hour or maybe a little more(on Monday) a day and none on the weekends/Tuesday.  Loren seems to be telling me to "back off" and I'm like "SO STUPID!!!!" (Oliver on The OC).  1. Speaking of which,  Mme DeRobert wrote on a test on which I had mentioned "Le OC" "Qu'est-ce que c'est?" Seulement le meilleur programme en histoire de la monde!  2. Also speaking of which, I'm annoyed that Loren likes Oliver.  He's so evil and like antagonistic.  It's just like Othello, Oliver (Iago) keeps messing with Ryan's mind and Ryan (Othello except a little different) is the only one who knows the truth.  OK, maybe it isn't like Othello, but Oliver does mess with Ryan and Ryan is the only good one who acts on his morals, even if it is against the rules, to save Marissa.   3. Speaking of Marissa, I think that she is a bad match for Ryan.  She is really a better match with Oliver, because they are both so messed up in the head.  But that doesn't mean that Ryan wasn't right in trying to save her; he was still her boyfriend and recognized the evil machinations of that kook Oliver.  Also, did you know that the actress who plays Marissa, Mischa Barton, is only seventeen?  Too young.  4. As you read this, you may be listening to a new teen angst song.  Loren and I agreed to change both of our songs back to teen angst songs, even though Alicia Keys is cool.  Hear with enjoyment.  5. Loren should really stop making "your mom" jokes.  They're getting so old.  6. I'm getting a little better at speaking with this goshforsaken retainer, but I'm still going to take it off at the trial.  7. I FINALLY took the history test today that I was supposed to have taken on Wednesday.  Now I have just two tests, a quiz, and a trial in the week before I leave.  Woohoo (notice the period in lieu of an exclamation point).  Here are some quotes from history to end the ol' post-o-rooney:  "It's kind of a quick and dirty way to do it." --- Ms. Heidlage  "Christianity... it's a faith-based religion, there's nothing logical about it." --- Ms. Heidlage  "What were some of the internal problems?  Starvation, poverty, misery..." --- Ms Heidlage, and I'm like, yeah, the government really should have taken action to combat misery."

       Sorry I haven't updated in a few days.  France is really cool, especially the part where I get to be away from my family.  The only bad part is that there's no good TV.  Also, you guys are never online while I'm awake.  I need some consultation, if you knumsayin.  I got a couple of shirts at this cool, cheap store called H & M.  This weekend, Arnaud and I might see a movie, and on Monday, the group is taking a troup to Normandy.  Very cool.

       I am now in Paris, after a day a couple dozen hours longer than most.  The flight was pretty gouda; we had individual TVs and everything.  However, I didn't sleep a wink, though I finished beaucoup de French homework.  Charles de Gaulle airport was just as I expected it to be: futuristic, like Logan, but dirty futuristic.  Le Massillon was not that bad, though I could understand like 0.000000000000001% of what people were saying.  Arnaud, my host guy, is pretty cool.  I keep talking in English accidentally, I really need to immerse myself more.  In The Al Blog's grand tradition, here is a quote from Civics, my favorite class so far:  "Les juifs ont des nez longs..."  (The Jews have long noses.) --- M. Guyont  Well, not great, but whadayagannado.

       I leave today.  I'm all packed, and somewhat excited.  Will says that I can't vote by proxy, but I can have statements read.  Woo hoo.  I plan to send a lot of postcards, but probably only one per person/class.  I don't know whether or not to e-mail people, since everything important is going to be blogged anyway.  I guess I'll just e-mail in response to e-mails.  Which reminds me, everybody give a holler (holla?) via e-mail.  Unless you're online before five pm, I won't be able to talk to you on AIM.  I got two new interviews at Mock Trials yesterday, Hiro and John.  I felt bad because I told Luba I would interview her but never got around to it.  Hiro was somewhat insulting, but I got some good material out of him.  John was almost completely inaudible, even when I turned up the volume on his clip to the maximum level, but his was still pretty good.  Will's interview still reigns supreme.  When I get back, remind me to show y'all the video.  It'll take a few days to prepare, so we ought to have some big thing the weekend after I come back showing the movie etc.  As is the first title of my movie, "Au Revoir, Jewton!"

       Hey y'all... or ya!  Yeah that was not funny at all.  You might have noticed that on the internet, I've been imitiating Loren since he seems more internetionally successful than me.  I would ask for your comments but no one has ever in the history of the world given me his comments after I have said that.  Tomorrow is my last opportunity.  If all goes well, there will be many more events, but if I fail, there won't be another chance.  I'm glad that, according to sources, The O.C. has been duly taped.  These days I actually like one of Arnaud's computer games, though it's actually an American game, a version of Grand Theft Auto (racing).  I've been doing fairly well, and it's a lot of fun.  Today I had my very first crepe.  It wasn't bad, tasting just like a chocolate-chip pancake.  And it cost as much as my Coke.  Speaking of which, love don't cost a thing, but it pays to be yourself.  That was actually a good movie.  I saw it who knows how long ago with Matt KK.  I may take its advice.  There was actually a great opportunity today, which I missed (the window was only a few minutes wide, but it was so perfect... oh well, que sera sera).  Speaking of other languages, on the metro today I was reading the warning sign (the one that says in English "Beware of trapping your hands in the doors"), and I noticed something strange.  In the French version, it ended with a period.  English, period.  German, period.  Spanish, period.  Italian, exclamation point!  Those Italians... a very passionate people.  I can't believe how not-that-quick Loren is.  He read my last post (below), the part about the guide-Noah dialogue, and he didn't think that I realized that the person isn't actually alive today.  Ay yay yay, buenos amigos sombrero muchachos.  I haven't sent out either postcard yet.  I'll do it tomorrow, along with getting more money from the distributeur automatique (ATM), buying a simple, functional jacket at Les Halles, and visiting Versailles with... the group... including... Viggy would be proud.  Of both things, going to the Versailles and...

       I just got back from a three-day trip around northern France.  We visited a D-Day museum, the beaches on which the Americans landed, the American cemetery, the castle-abbey at Mont-Saint-Michel, the city of Tours, and several chateaux.  Most were fairly interesting, though three-hour bus rides seven times a day can be a bit boring.  Especially since I lent my headphones and batteries to others who needed them and only had two postcards.  The following is a dialogue which took place at the Mont-Saint-Michel, the top of which is very high off the ground.  Tour Guide: In the fifteenth century, an architect here loved one of the servant women, but she didn't love him, so he threw himself off the top of the church.  Noah Feldman: Is he still alive today?  Yeah.  That was good.  Also, before I forget, a quote from math a few weeks ago that I never got around to blogging:  "You're an Apple person?  Do you like them because they're stupid?"  Some... stuff happened.  Not the good stuff.  Stuff that I wouldn't feel comfortable blogging, though I'm not at fault or in a position of negativity; if you want to know about it, ask me.  Let's just say I'm really responsible.  And modest.  And I know that won't make any sense since I'm not really saying what happened, but whatever.  Still nothing has happened, and that's addressed to those such as Loren and Melody, but I might have at least a working outline.  We'll see.  Be online, seriously, I don't have any more classes so I'll have like two weeks in which I can talk to you.  So far I've written two postcards, to Mr. Stanley and to Loren.  Rest assured, I'll send more.  Loren, note that since I wrote that several days ago, the game may or may not have changed by the time you get it.  I'm going to keep the song.  Idk, I like it, and it's a pain to start messing with things while I'm in "Europe's Dumpster."  No offense, however many millions of Frenchmen there are.

       No one's ever online when I need them.  There are people on from time to time, but they're not the people I   really   want to talk to, no offense to Julia Kalow.  Loren's rarely online when I'm online, and when he is, he doesn't have anything good to say.  Melody's online from time to time, but only for like two seconds.  She keeps pulling a Sarah Blanks.  Richie's the only good person, and he's online more because his timescale is different from you Jewtonians.  But the others - John, Jonny, Jason (whoa all Js) - fugghedaboudit.  I really need to talk to a few of you guys, especially L and Mel, since they're good for consultation.  Tomorrow I leave for this Normandy trip, for three or four days.  I don't know, I just don't know, what I should do.  We're visiting the site of D-Day, and in six days is V-Day, I don't know if I can do it in time.  Au secours!

       Nothing much has happened since Friday.  Yesterday, I saw Lost in Translation (the English version) with Arnaud.  The cinema was so weird.  I could have seen pretty much any movie, including those rated R in the US, like 21 Grams (or, as it is known here, vingt-et-un grammes).  They don't butter their popcorn here, they   sugar   it.  I ordered mine without sugar, but it was still pretty sweet (sweet as in sugary, not like rad).  They gave me my coke in a bottle instead of an icy cup.  In the theater, the seats were all like car seats, all padding with automotive-type armrests and no cupholders (but then again, no cups).  The movie was in English with French subtitles.  I did my best not to look down at the subtitles.  Arnaud said that he didn't either, but there was an awful lot of idiomatic expressions that I wouldn't have understood had I been him.  That's it, except that Arnaud taught me a new card game.  Here, they call the game War "Bataille" (battle), and then there's this variation called "Bataille en Corse" (Corse = Corsica).  Here's how it goes: The object of the game is to get all the cards.  Each person gets half the deck, and then they take turns putting cards down in the middle; it doesn't matter if they're higher or lower.  If someone puts down a Jack, a Queen, a King, or an Ace, the other person has a certain number of chances to put down a Jack, a Queen, a King, or an Ace (one for Jack, two for Queen, three for King, and four for Ace), and then the other person has to do the same if the person puts down one of those four cards in response.  If all one's chances are used up without having put down one of those four cards, the other person takes all the cards in the middle and starts again.  If two of the same kind of card are put down in succession (e.g., if someone puts down a three and then the other person puts down another three), the first person to slap the cards gets the cards.  If at the end of the game, someone has lost all his cards, then they select one card at random from the other person's deck and keep playing; if the regular taking turns thing continues, then they can keep taking cards from the other's deck, but if they lose their cards again, they've lost.  If more than two people are playing, a loser can reenter the game by slapping the deck if there's a pair.  And that's how the game is played.

       Rant!  I'm sick of being labeled a Jew by my host family.  When I first got here, my host mother made a big deal about buying kosher food for me after I said I couldn't eat the pork pizza she had made.  She actually said (and I'm paraphrasing but it was pretty much exactly like this), "I love Jewish people.  Some of my best friends are Jews."  Today, when I didn't feel like going to a German movie with French subtitles, she thought I didn't want to go because the Nazis had done something to my family.  Jesus Christ.  That's one of my biggest like anti-stuff positions.  In my humble opinion, distinctions shouldn't make ANY difference except those that are inherent to them, like how I can't eat pork because I happen to be Jewish.  That means that we shouldn't discriminate because of differences, but we also shouldn't celebrate differences, like Jennifer Huntington and all her PC goons force us to.  We shouldn't celebrate differences since then, even if everyone thinks that Judaism is The Most Wonderful Thing in the World, they still see me as a Jew.  I am not a Jew.  I'm a person.  I'm a human being.  Jesus.  I feel like writing an essay.  But I blew my chance to express this, one of my biggest theses, in an essay, so now I'm stuck writing about how in the nineteenth century, China and Japan reacted to Western influence in many different, related ways...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...huh?  What?  Oh.  Well, at least yesterday I got to write about how Sophocles was the suckiest sucker whoever sucked.  My last two sentences were: However, with reasoned analysis, it is clear that Oedipus Rex cannot meet modern standards of tragedy.  Either that, or Sophocles simply was not a very good playwright to begin with.  Ah, I love bashing what teachers think is cool.  As I told Stephanie Kaplan in a postcard, cynicism is my only escape from the drudgery of school.  Ahhhhhhh, vented.  That was so refreshing.  Like an Herbal Essences commercial, although Garnier Fructics commercials are so much cooler.  OK, now I'm rambling.

       So yesterday I had a really bad day.  I thought France was really sucky, since there was nothing to do but homework and even that I could barely do since my guy was playing this horrible game on the computer for ten+ hours.  Today, I would still prefer Newton - where I have my own computer and can speak my own language and don't have to stay up until one in the morning to talk to Dan freakin' Jung and have actual food and good TV and Coca-Cola and root beer and heat and baths and my cat - but I think I can bear France for another week and a bit.  My homework is coming right along.  I finally wrote my Oedipus essay today.  I'm fairly sure I can finish all my homework assuming I do little else for the rest of the time, except for chemistry for which I lack the textbook and any conception of what I'm supposed to do.  Despite what you may have guessed from my last post, though I can't do anything in France, my chances are looking fairly good for Jewton.  Except for that one thing that I'm repulsed by.  Oh well, there's no one else I would like more, even if I hadn't learned that a certain someone wanted to castrate me.

       Rants but not really because it's late:  1. Noah Feldman's host mother gave me the run-around.  I got his number from two different sources, and I called it twice, and she said I had the wrong number.  Then I asked him in person, and it was the right number.  Darn those French putains.  2. "Something's Gotta Give" is such a horrible movie.  Don't ever see it.  But see "21 Grams," that was great.  Oh also I heard that "Blueberry" is the worst movie ever.  Don't see that either.  3. OK, I have one last opportunity, and six potential days in which to use it.  No pressure.

       Saw "21 Grammes" with Arnaud, wrote postcards, continued Le Petit Prince, learned really cool stuff, plan may or may not fall through.  Idk if I have the license to post the following quote, but Stephanie Kaplan heard it in MT, which I would have been at had I not been French.  It says "Coconut Girl" on Juliet DeFrancisco's bag.  Hiro: Why does it say "Coconut Girl?" Juliet: I think it's a reference to my chest. Hiro: Oh... wait, are they really that hairy?

       I'm reasonably excited about going home on Monday (but note duly that I won't be in school until Tuesday since I'm getting home at like 5 pm).  Mr. Stanley got my postcard and read it to the class, so there's hope that the other three people to whom I sent postcards will get theirs too.  One of those, who can be very melodramatic at times, told me that she loved getting mail, and I agree- mail is so much funner to receive than most anything else.  Well, that's about it.  Oh yeah, and I'm sure there'll be more quotes once I'm back in ol' Jewton.

       Sorry about this extra space at the top of the frame, I don't know why that's there.  If any of you readers know about such things, take a gander at the source code and tell me if I can do anything to fix it; the code that governs this frame is in the "Blogger Code" section.  MSN Explorer is so cool.  I admit it, Microsoft does make better software than Apple, although this software is at its best when run on superior Apple hardware and in its Apple versions.  For example, Word is really annoying on a PC, but on a Mac, it's much more streamlined and easy-to-use than in its original form, and it beats the crap out of AppleWorks.  Then again, a lot of Apple software is good to, like simple programs that do what they set out to easily and quickly with zero hassle, but for the main programs, Microsoft is a little more capable.  Whoa,   that   was nerdy.  I find that when I can't think of anything to say to people, but they're good people and I don't want to miss an opportunity to talk to them, I end up spouting some long conversation about something nerdy and trivial which reflects badly on me.  On the other hand, for the one subject of mine that's always the most important and most entertaining, I'm trying to kind of become independent in my actions and so il ne faut pas que j'en parle.  Sometimes French is the best way to express something (mostly subjunctive stuff), but most of the time English is best.  Damn, I did it again.

       In these last two weeks there has been and will be so little going on, given that it's vacation.  I've used the phrase "given that" so often lately, given that it's useful in supporting points.  I bought the soundtrack to Kill Bill today because my guy and I were at the Fnac (roughly equivalent to Borders plus Best Buy) and I was looking for this Phantom Planet album but they didn't have it and I wanted to get something and I liked the music from Kill Bill.  It was pretty good.    All I have left is one ten-minute (two-page) essay about the treaties after WWI, some Macbeth stuff that I don't really have to do, a buttload of math, and impossible chemistry (I don't have the textbook).  It's strange how my history class hasn't started WWI or the Russian Revolution yet but I have to have done a bunch of stuff with both of them.  What to end with...  how about nothing.  Oh yeah, next week should be the one hundredth Strong Bad E-mail, did anyone else notice that?  Ah, I miss TV.

       Today with Dan Jung was fun.  Finally, one person likes my movie.  A lot of today I would have done, should have done, in another situation, if you catch my drift.  Oh well.  I end so many paragraphs like that, I don't know, that's the general idea most of the time.  Apparently one person tells me that it's getting tiring talking about stuff, maybe I should just cut her off.  We'll see.  Oh, and here's a quote just for that person's benefit, not actually funny but makes a point:  Me: Do you remember how to get to 2 Washington St.?  Mock Trials is there on Sunday.  My father: Oh, you mean that big fancy mansion?

       Not to be Melodramatic or anything, but I feel like so much of my life is just how I want it.  There's just one little piece I'm missing, and I can't quite make the jump.  It's not that I'm a coward (though that doesn't help), heck, I've done it before, more than once.  But it's still either that I chicken out, or that it doesn't turn out the way I want it to.  I'm so close, it's so annoying.  Nothing much happened today, but the sentiments in the last post still apply if you're wondering.  Badminton with Dan Jung is so fun(g).  Oh, and my Myth/Folk Tale/Sci-Fi class is so annoying, everyone is really nerdy and the teacher doesn't know what she's talking about.  Oh well, I guess I'll have to suck it up.  -Edit- Stephanie says that it's the most hypocritical thing ever for me to complain about nerdy people.  I don't take back what I said because 1) these people really are like fantastically nerdier than I am, and 2) Stephanie thinks that anyone who forgot to trim their eyelashes to the exactly proper length is the nerdiest nerd who ever nerded.  And I'm going to get yelled at for saying that, so I'll pull a Loren and apologize, but not delete what I said because it needed to be said.  "Sorry."

       Half day today.  Life has been so much more eventful since I came back.  I might not be able to take the new rush, except that most of it is fun.  Even English; I understand why Stephanie likes it now.  When I went to the Mock Trials meeting last night, Elliott was like, "Since you left, we haven't lost a match.  Think that means anything?"  I kind of lost my energy for Mock Trials, but it's fun nonetheless.  I blew this thing today that I might talk about if you ask me, and then there are a couple of other issues that I can't talk about to anyone, 'cept maybe one person.  I'm really getting back into the hang of classes, and I've actually been handling my work better than before, even though the new work ethic I got from France was "do it if you feel like it."  All in all, Jewton life has been fairly good.  Oh, and I finished my movie, talk to me about figuring something out whereby people can watch it.  "It's called an unnatural death because the person doesn't... die naturally." ---Ms. Kranes

       As y'all probably know, I'm back.  I'm finding Newton life fun, and I'm glad to be here.  I also find that I have a lot to say in response to questions about my trip.  Most of my classes today have been fun; even the not-fun ones were better than like sitting in my room in Paris, waiting for the next meal for lack of a better thing to do.  Loren's new template is pretty cool, I saw that it was one of the most popular templates on the site where we get them.  I don't like his song, though.  I've discovered that I enjoy actual conversation a lot more than AIM, but there's never that much time to talk.  People have been cool to talk to anyhow; I like them a lot more than the French.  Oh, and my plane ride, despite being seven hours long, was really fun, figure out why.

       I'm glad that whole business of yesterday - or at least my part in it - is resolved, that was carried a lot further than it should have been.  It wasn't any of my business, either.  We took the multiple-choice section of the WWI test yesterday.  It was fairly straightforward.  We did it in three- and four-person groups; I was with Jake, Lainey, and Eric.  Loren commented that it must have been difficult, given that Eric and I are both so opinionated.  However, most of the questions we agreed on, I knew I was right on the ones on which I fought (though sometimes Eric didn't want to hear my arguments), and in the end, every question that I had an answer to was answered in accordance with my answer.  I did something very unpopular, though: I saw that the short-answer and essay questions that we would answer on Monday were attached to the test, and I asked Ms. Heidlage about it.  She took that sheet from each person and wrote new questions.  My rationale that will hopefully save me from getting beaten up - though already I've been getting very murderous glances - is that when she graded the multiple-choice answers, she would have noticed that the short-answer and essay questions were attached and changed them anyway, so what I did had no ultimate effect.  I've been following through with half of Julia's advice, the other half I haven't been able to accomplish yet.  So far, there have been no bad effects, but no progress either.  It's been easy, the half that I've been doing, since it's consisted of nothing.  I really ought to do the half I haven't been doing, since that's the part that includes doing things.  As it is, it feels like I'm doing the wrong thing, or at least not doing the right thing.  And yes, I'm fully aware that you have no idea what I'm talking about.  I saw The Fog of War with Matt Woolf today.  It was a fairly good movie, but I noticed several problems and so I'm going to write a bad review (for extra credit in history) since they're easier and funner than writing good reviews.  I learned some important lessons, but I don't know whether I will use them or whether I already knew them.  I guess I'll write a mixed review.  Right now, my life deserves a mixed review, it's sometimes awesomely awesome and sometimes suckily sucky.  Whatever.  I can't very well have this end so Melodramatically, so here's a dialogue between myself and Matt.  I can tell it because I had no intention to say it that way.  It was said after he was trying to convince me of something.  Me: I don't know whether to believe you.  It seems like you always start out with something that is a little bit true, and then make it more false and false.  I mean, more and more false. Matt: Haha, more false and false.

       I think this post-every-other-day thing is working out.  The National French Exam was yesterday.  It was really easy - I missed like two questions maximum on these little obscure grammar things - but the stories weren't as exciting as they ought to have been.  I thought there weren't any deaths, but then Ben Ostrow pointed out that the open-heart surgery person probably died, after all, the doctor obviously had time to make this recording.  We did our skits today in French, ours (Ian and mine) went fairly well.  The best one was Ben and Charlie's group, it was really funny when they found anthrax in the mail.  I'm annoyed that a certain someone won't talk to me in person unless it's important.  I just have so many reasons, it seems like such a given that we could talk, it's like too obvious to even try to explain.  Maybe she just doesn't want to be seen talking to me.  Whatever, but I'm not the one who wants to punish poor people "for being lazy."  A few days ago I got some advice that contradicted the themes of a lot of my earlier advice.  I don't know what to do, so I'll probably end up doing nothing - which is exactly what this new advisor wants me to do apparently.  Badminton with Dan Jung is so fun.  This is so much better than AM Gym.

       One of the answers to Loren's survey reminded me of something that happened yesterday.  Loren and I were on Main Street, about to go to my house, and this lady came up and was trying to get everybody to leave, and Loren was like, "Don't they always say to stay in school?"  And I, as the lady, am like, "School is no place for teenagers!"  Anyways, here's the survey with my answers:  [x] full name --- Alexander Samuel Dietz I, Sr., Esq.

[x] occupation --- Lawyer (probably prosecutor) or teacher. [x] ride --- For my first car, Toyota Matrix.  After that, who knows? [x] future resident of --- Cambridge, Boston, or Brookline.

[x] current love --- Well... not actually who you'd think. [x] love or lust? --- The one right now isn't lust, but it's more of a crush than love.  Wait, which is better?  The good kind of love includes some lust. [x] best love song --- Stupid Love Song by Phoneboy [x] is it possible to be in love more than one person at the same time? --- Not at the exact same time (because you can only concentrate on one thing at a time), but you can generally be in love with more than one person. [x] when love hurts, you --- go to the movies is what you probably should do [x] true or false: all you need is love. --- False, but it's a big part of what you need. [x] is there such thing as love at first sight? --- Not love per se. [x] is puppy love, really love? --- No, I could explain it and I tried to once to Melody but it took too long and I don't really think she was getting it.  `- 0PP0SiTE SEX [x] turn on`s --- I think I'm actually off my thing about the way girls move.

[x] short or long hair --- Short for boys, sorta shortish for girls. [x] innie or outie --- innie [x] sunshine or rain --- Sunshine. [x] moon or sun --- Sun, duh. [x] basketball or football --- Neither, but basketball.  Who the crap is Little Man? [x] righty or lefty --- Righty [x] holla front or holla back --- Not the right person to be asking that question.

I hate how NBC is trying to make that a verb.  "Did you google the perp?"  "I googled him but all that googled was googly."  `-RAND0M `iSHH [x] on your buddy list, do you have more buddies of the same sex or the opposite? --- Same, but for some reason I like only talk to girls nowadays online. [x] what`s your most embarassing moment? --- No comment. [x] do you have carpet or wood floors? --- Carpet.  What real parent gets a house with hardwood floors?  Especially since we got this house when I was two months old, and you shouldn't have hardwood floors with a baby. [x] what`s under your bed? --- Some junk, this box with some miscellaneous CDs or something like that. [x] what are you scared of? --- Never succeeding in that area. [x] what is your greatest accomplishment? --- Bar Mitzvah, but hopefully Kilimanstupid will trump that, and then Mock Trials will trump that. [x] what kinda roof is over your head? --- Blue thingies, vinyl siding or something.  I remember when David Letterman had shingles.

[x] how many phones? --- Let me count... seven I think. [x] how many residents? --- Five, counting Hanne. [x] how many dvds do you have? --- A fair number. [x] last dentist visit --- Last week.  I was a little concerned when the guy was explaining what he was going to do and accidentally said "gums" instead of "teeth" and then corrected himself. [x] last doctor visit --- A long time ago.

[x] last i/m -- There oughtn't to be a slash between I and M.  Probably to Jing last night. [x] last hug --- I don't really hug, even my parents.

       I might actually have taken/be taking some action with a result, whether or not it's the desired result is yet to be seen.  Or maybe I'm misinterpreting what I've done, we'll see.  Here are some quotes/dialogues from today's Mock Trials:  Hiro: It looks like this e-mail keeps getting... Elliott: ...importanter and importanter.

       George got into McGill.  So I guess he won't be a bum for a while anyways (until he drops out, that is).  I shouldn't say that.  But I just did.  Tant pis.  I actually got through the week.  I don't feel so bad about work anymore.  I've taken to not doing my homework if it probably won't be checked.  I'm turning into John.  This morning, I cut this bakesale thing for Tanzania.  Sarah ended up missing twenty minutes of math because of it.  I'm not going to get up at 6:30 to beg people for money.  Mme DeRobert forgot about my test (the retake of the subjunctive the first of which I missed while in France); this is the second time that this has happened.  Luckily, I saw her in the hall and she came over and printed one.  I'm not going to hold it against her.  I did OK on the test.  Oh, and she recommended me for AP French.  I think like everybody got in except Deena who didn't want to.  I still have no idea about the rest of my classes; and the President didn't help at all (for those of you who aren't cool enough to get it, I'm talking about Kennedy).  And then Melody came and she and Loren awkwarded me at lunch.  I never know what to do in those situations.  There was nowhere for me to go.  John said something mean.  I won't repeat it.  Oh, and yesterday Loren made a couple of purposely nerdy jokes, one of which turned out to be very dirty.  Both and John's were funny, though.  That's what counts.  There were some really funny quotes today and yesterday:  "How'd you poop on your shoulder?" ---Alex Gollick  "If selling babies for money online is wrong, then I don't want to be right!" ---Ben Landau-Taylor  "She was born and raised in Boston all her life." ---Ms. Richardson (And I'm like, man, that must've been one long labor!)  "We're not up to the 1917s." ---Ms. Heidlage  "Be aware of all the unnatural things that are happening in this play, because now, the cork has been unleashed." ---Ms. Kranes

       So yeah, the hundredth Strong Bad was a real let-down.  But on to other things...  This week has been kinda bad, but I think the worst is over.  On the plus side, I've gotten all necessary signatories, and no more big tests for a while except for Le Petit Prince.  Here are some highlights from yesterday's Elite-Eight trial against Dennis Yarmouth:  Our team objected to "multiple questions," so the opposing lawyer said "I'll break it down, Your Honor."  Everyone expected her to start getting her freak on.  "This e-mail came up in Mr. E-mail's letter, didn't it?"  The lawyer who was crossing Palmer (Jake Chervinsky) was trying to get him to say that there was a correlation between the plaintiff (a musician)'s response and her sales, based on information said by the plaintiff's witnesses, but Jake wouldn't say it.  Finally, he said, "I think there's a correlation between the people testifying for Ms. Sarak."  After the trial, at the meeting, Elliott (the lawyer-coach) said, "Whether it's Brookline or Sharon, you KNOW they're gonna be working 24/7 'til Monday."  And I imagine that they walk drowsily into the courtroom, and they're slow on everything, and when the judge asks them about it, they say "We've been working on this for three days!"  In the end, the court found in favor of the plaintiff (we were defense), and the defendant was ordered to pay Jody Sarak damages in the amount of one dollar.  So we won.  The person with the role of the defendant should have gone up and handed them a dollar.  At the meeting, we were apologizing to her for having to pay such damages.  On Monday, I get to miss school for the Final Four, and if we win that, I miss school Tuesday for the state championship.

       I aced the history test yesterday.  The chemistry test today also wasn't impossible, but I did guess on a lot of them.  I estimate B-range.  MUN yesterday; my working paper was generally agreed to be the only one (of four) worthy of consideration, and it was generally supported.  Josh Nathan (the UK, my biggest supporter), said, "I want to agree with Working Paper one-point...you!"  Last night, I wrote the following resolution; so far no one has responded or signed but that'll probably change soon.   Draft Resolution Iraqi Elections  Sponsor: Iraq Signatories: Republic of Congo, Malaysia, Myanmar   The General Assembly,  Recalling all relevant resolutions, particularly Security Council Resolution 1511,  Affirming the inalienable right of the Iraqi people to self-determination,  Encouraging the efforts of the Coalition Provisional Authority and the Governing Council, hereafter identified collectively as "the Iraqi transitional government," as well as those of the people of Iraq, to develop a free and democratic permanent government,  Recognizing the work of the Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period, commonly known as the Transitional Administrative Law and hereafter referred to as "the TAL" or as "the Law," in laying the foundations for a permanent government of and by the people of Iraq respecting the liberties and powers of a free people to govern itself,  Noting potential security and other concerns arising from the tensions inherent to a nation recently engulfed in ethnic division, but maintaining an optimistic view of the future;  1. Decides, upon the due request of the Iraqi transitional government, to commission the United Nations Electoral Assistance Division (UNEAD) to assist the upcoming election process by actions including but not limited to:  a. The advisement of the Iraqi transitional government on how to ensure a safe and effective election,  b. The supervision of both the general election structure and the particular voting system at each major voting place,  c. Such actions as are deemed pursuant to safeguarding the provisions related to the election of the National Assembly as described in Chapter Four of the TAL;  2. Recognizes officially the TAL as the Supreme Law of the Land in Iraq for the interim period (as defined in the Law), along with all of its provisions and preparations for the elections of the National Assembly of the future permanent Iraqi government and the transition to sovereignty with a timetable detailed in the Law;  3. Defines the recent proposals of Kurdish, Sunni, and other groups as legitimate expressions of such groups' respective voices, the rights of which are protected by Article 13 of the TAL, but which are nevertheless merely editorials with no actual weight on the determination of the Iraqi government;  4. Affirms that it is not the place of the United Nations to decide the government of Iraq noting the principles of self-determination and national sovereignty on which this organisation was based, and reaffirms that this decision already has been made by the people of Iraq in the form of the TAL;  5. Calls for, upon the due request of the Iraqi transitional government, peacekeepers to be sent to Iraq in order to maintain security in matters related to the establishment of the future permanent government of Iraq and elections thereto, including, inter alia, public rallies, campaign events, political speeches and demonstrations, and the voting itself;  6. Condemns the use of background checks on political candidates as an action fraught with the possibility of election tampering employed to keep certain groups in power, contrary to the democratic and free principles of the TAL, the future constitution of Iraq, and the United Nations;  7. Emphasizes the need for a more permanent security system for Iraq, protected by the United States of America in its role as the Occupying Power, a multinational force, and/or a United Nations peacekeeping force, eventually to transition to the control of the government of Iraq, in order to establish and maintain security in matters of Iraqi administration, elections, and other matters of national security, to be outlined in future resolutions and/or international agreements.

       Mock Trials today; several very funny jokes for which you had to be there.  One mildly comical remark was when PJ said: "It is a complete depiction of what it depicts."  People were also making fun of when Hiro apparently bowed at the trial before he gave his closing; Elliott joked that that was ok but it was really strange when he took his shoes off at the beginning.  Haha, Asian people are Asian.  I also wrote my working paper on Iraqi elections today, and depending on on how much of my other work I procrastinate, I may write the resolution too so I can garner enough signatories and submit it at the meeting tomorrow.  It's posted on the Yahoo! Groups site, but here's a copy; keep in mind that I myself represent Iraq:   General Assembly Iraqi Elections Working Paper  The authors of this working paper affirm the inalienable right of the Iraqi people to govern itself in a fashion consistent with democratic and traditional purposes.  To that end, we propose:  1. That, upon the request of the Iraqi transitional government, the United Nations Electoral Assistance Division (UNEAD) be commissioned to advise said government and to facilitate, oversee, and safeguard the upcoming elections for the National Assembly;  2. That, if it is deemed necessary to Iraqi national security and is done under the full consent of the Iraqi transitional government, the United Nations send peacekeepers to establish and maintain security in situations relating to the establishment of the future permanent government of Iraq and elections thereto;  3. That the authority of the Iraqi transitional government and the future permanent government, and the rights of the people of Iraq under international agreements and under the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL), be fully respected in all aforementioned and other actions of the United Nations;  and,  4. That the predominance of the TAL be officially recognized as the framework of Iraqi government during the transitional period, the document entrusted with the responsibility to begin the future permanent government of Iraq, and the foundation of the future permanent constitution of Iraq; maintaining a democratic and republican course which secures the liberties and principles of self-determination for a free people of the world.

       Hiked today with Tanzania group and pack.  It was tiring but generally alright.  I talked to Mr. Jobe a lot.  I don't know why, but I've been discontent this weekend.  I need real people to talk to; AIM sucks.  Arnaud comes on Friday.  Oh, and I can now play "The Way We Get By" on the piano, good for me.

       I know I'm not supposed to do two posts in one night, but the other one didn't really count since it was just introducing the new template.  To respond to comments, Kevin helped me get rid of the A thing, and I changed "Melo" to "Melody" (and "Duke" to "Loren" while I was at it).  I'm glad I'm getting such good response, with the exception of Hiro, who uses IE for Macs which sucks suckily.  I aced the math test, which I started yesterday.  Mr. Stanley said he liked my QEDs, I always make an effort stylizing them.  Next test I'll make cartoons with them if I remember.  Mme. DeRobert etait malade aujourd'hui, donc, je passerai l'examen du Petit Prince au moins six jours apres la reste de la classe.  Mange-le.  Oh and I also did quite well on the chemistry test, given that I didn't study at all and all of the material was taught when I was absent, plus I didn't have a calculator (someone had taken it while Ms. Srikanth was borrowing it).

       As you can see, I have changed my template yet again.  If you prefer the old one, tell me so; I still have the old code saved.  Here are the three primary changes:  1. A new color scheme, plain and simple  2. Fewer and smaller frames, focusing the attention on the posts themselves  3. The "comment" feature, whereby you can comment on each post, like on a xanga, except you don't have to have an account or anything.  I recommend using the comment feature well, stating your first name only, with all the correct spellings, capitalizations, and grammatical rules.  I look forward to hearing from you.

       I own Newton North.  Today, I avoided my math teacher such that I'll probably have this test that I might have taken today (that everyone else took yesterday) tomorrow instead, or maybe even Friday.  I made it so I could take this French test, which my class took yesterday, on Friday.  And here's the kicker, the big tamale, the shiznit (which reminds me, Graham was pretending he was gonna act gangsta to the judge at the state championship trial, so he was like, "Yo Hona, would you be down if I entered this shiznit?"): today I sweet-talked my way from a 49% final chemistry grade to a 95%.  Try and beat that.  The rest of today is looking pretty sweet too; an all-new Mock Trials, an all-new The O.C., and an all-new Law & Order.  Wednesday is officially my favorite day of the week.  And now, for your reading pleasure, the following is the short story I wrote for English.  The assignment was to write about us looking at someone's hands, what they suggest about the person, and have them say something to you at the end.  I don't know, ask Ms. Kranes where she gets this stuff.  Oh, and at the top is supposed to be our initial, separate description of their hands.  Enjoy.    Ideal Cogs    His hands are effeminate, thin, and bony.  A pale yellow covers them uniformly.  They have long, narrow fingers, with nails that extend just a bit over his fingers, with scarcely any tips.  His skin is smooth and soft, hairless and without much muscle.  He has two scars, one on each hand, small but visible.  	I sit in my history class, trying to force myself to think about World War I.  Ms. Heidlage has assigned us to work with partners in preparation for the test on Monday.  She paired me with Loren, next to whom I sit every history class, with whom I have talked an average of five times a week for the past two years.  Good job, Ms. Heidlage, this will really get me thinking about the Great War.  	Glancing up from my teacher (who is ordinarily a fantastic educator)'s vague study guide, I look at Loren, who intently regards his own sheet.  Grasping it with his left hand, he scans the document with his right-hand index finger.  His digits are long and thin, typical of his entire body.  These fingers are not made for manual labor; they are made for schoolwork, bureaucracy, business - suitable for the business-law course his mother decided he would take.  I notice two scars on each of his hands, minor, boyhood scrapes indicating that school has not vanquished all remnants of his playful childhood days.  As he turns to the back side of the page - gently, delicately, using only what force is needed for the task at hand - I notice the effeminate smoothness of his skin.  Roughness finds no place here; neither do the hair and muscle characteristic of large, masculine hands.  Loren scratches his nose, and I see that his fingernails extend just beyond the ends of his fingers, with practically no white section, serving their explicit purpose with no need for addition.  With his right hand, he scribbles a reminder on the side of his paper, and I cannot help but note their color, pale but distinctive yellow.  The fact that he is Asian, Chinese (though he hails from New Hampshire) is impossible to neglect; so are all of the cultural and disciplinary differences included therein.  	Loren is a student, this is clear.  The look of his hands was for the most part predetermined at birth, but they still reflect his status as the product of his environment.  Loren, though not unknown to revelry, has been shaped by his family and by his schools to become the worker they desired.  His hands, tools to him like he is a tool to his society, show aptitude for accomplishing just the job required, yielding the maximum result with the minimum deviation.  Loren's genes may have determined the structure of his digits, but his world decided what they would be trained to do, what instincts he should learn.  We are a people that values efficiency and dexterity in this modern age over the ruggedness and creativity held so highly in times of yore and glory.  We, the people, found ideal cogs for this system in Loren's hands.  Inevitably, I compare his lot to my own, wondering how much this has proven true in my case.  	Loren puts his paper down onto his desk, setting his pen beside it.  Seeing that I am looking at him, he takes this opportunity to ask something we may have to know on Monday.  	"Alex," he questions apathetically, "I forget.  Who was Mustafa Kemal again?"  	I say to myself, back to the drudgery of school, back to this place that produced the very same cycle in which Loren is trapped and in which I may be doomed to fall.  	But dammit, who the crap was Mustafa Kemal?  [THE END]

       WE WON THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP!!!  Not that I had anything to do with it, but we beat Pioneer Valley by one point at Fanueil Hall in the final trial with Associate Justice Roderick Ireland, Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, presiding.  It was the funnest trial I've ever been to, which isn't saying a heck of a lot since I've only been to two others (plus three or four scrimmages).  This means that we get a whole new case, and in May, we'll go to Orlando to represent Massachusetts at the national tournament.  One of the funny things that happened at the trial was that Martin, on the cross of Faulkner, had to go through this whole analogy about the law of supply and demand using thirty-cent and three hundred-dollar pieces of gum from CVS, and the witness was showboating saying, "Well, I wouldn't shop at that store."  I thought it was a waste of time, but we won, so whatever.  Oh, and every performance got a perfect ten except both openings got nines and the Sarak direct got a nine.  Here are some other quotes from the trial:  "Yes, I found myself very talented." ---Jody Sarak  "And you knew that she is responsible for a disproportionate amount of e-mails that are responsible on the internet, don't you?" ---Martin Rotemberg  "You can't both be true, can you?" ---Palmer Cross

       We won the semifinals, and now we're going to the state championship at Fanueil Hall tomorrow!  In other words, four-day weekend, and better-than-Law & Order entertainment!  Today's trial was fun, especially because, since I didn't take notes, I was free to enjoy the trial.  There weren't really any funny quotes, though Professor Chervy once said "I had nothing to do," on cross, that sounded strange.  Again, Palmer (Jake) had the best line in the trial.  He was being crossed on whether Sarak's intended marketing could have saved her CD, and was being asked if he even knew what it was, and Palmer said, "Well, if it were anything like her earlier marketing, it must not have been very good."  Ahhh, inside jokes.  Suck on that, non-MTers.

       Arnaud is here.  It's been pretty cool so far.  Y'all'll meet him on Monday.  Which reminds me of something...  Loren and Jing have been so difficult lately, at least online.  I can never get a straight answer out of either of them.  And I don't know what the crap has been happening with Jing and Kevin, ooOOoohh.  Mr. Stanley said he would let me retake the test over the weekend, and if I got it all right, he would change my test grade to a B+, and maybe make me take the tests I missed.  This isn't exactly what I was hoping for, but at least my grade will improve.  Maybe.  If anybody wants to do anything with Arnaud and me next weekend, like a movie, let me know.

       The following is an AIM conversation between myself and Loren, discussing whether it would be good to be a housewife.  Alex: you wouldn't be productive Alex: it would suck Alex: you wouldn't be able to respect yourself Loren: maybe not you because you have like Loren: the testosterone going and all Loren: but girls don't Loren: they enjoy watching soaps and cleaning and re-cleaning  The rest are quotes from my history class today.  "The three-year-old's going, 'I'm not collectivizing!'" ---Eric Messinger That's one smart three-year-old.  "He talks about how the liquidation of the kulaks is necessary, and he talks about how we need to... liquidate them!" ---Ms. Heidlage  "As a class, he needed to be liquidated." ---Ms. Heildage That's one small class.  "4.1 of the peasant households were in collective farms." ---Ms. Heidlage  Read on for a rant.

       I may not be able to go into Honors Math next year because I wrote down a plus instead of a minus.  Here's the story:  Because of my trip to France, two of the graded assignments this term were not counted in my score, since I wasn't there to do them.  Since there are never very many assignments in math, that left only one significant grade left, a test, which accounts for five-sixths of my term grade.  On this test, I got a 6.7 out of ten, or 67%.  The reason for every one of my errors stemmed from a theorem I had written down wrong, the Problem 12 Theorem.  You know how much I wrote down wrong?  One sign.  I wrote a plus instead of a minus.  And you know why I wrote it down at all?  Mr. Stanley gave us a sheet of theorems to use during the test.  Since we had gone over the Problem 12 Theorem the previous week, I asked why it wasn't on the sheet.  He said I could add it.  I then asked him if I had written it down correctly; it was a reasonable question since he admitted implicitly that we ought to have been given it anyway.  And get this: he said yes.  Because this test grade counts for five-sixths of my term grade, right now I'm getting a C third term.  Without a B every term, I cannot get into honors next year.  When I complained about my test grade, Mr. Stanley said I could come early tomorrow to talk about it with him.  Oh, I'll talk about it alright.  Plenty of words will come out of my mouth.  And some of them might have four letters, too.

       Well, so much for that whole comment thing.  Only one person, Gabe, commented, and that was after I like physically forced him to (well, as physically as AIM gets anyway).  I ended up asking Mme DeRobert, toward whom I had been leaning.  MCAS today, I aced it, writing about how Winston Smith from "1984" was heroic and stuff.  Mostly it was just a summary of the book, but I still think I'll get a good score.  Sarah Blanks' SparkNotes idea helped a lot.  Oh, and there was one late person to our room, Madi Abromowitz, and I was all like, ooooo, stop being late, lateface.  I really need to stop copying Loren.  On another note, I'm beginning not to hate my Myth, Folk Tale, and Science Fiction class as much as I used to.  It's a combination of the students, the discussion, and the argument (I love class argument).  Some people make really great (anti-teacher) points and I can back them up, and then other people make logical-sounding but wrong points and I can shoot them down.  "I need something to stab." ---Ian Bullock  "Oh, 3 times 3 is 9!" ---Mr. Stanley  "In algebra, 1 is considered the identity element because 2 times 1 is equal to 1." ---Mr. Stanley

       There isn't really any continuity to what happened today, so I'll just say things as they happened.  I got over my weekend slump today.  Dan Jung has yet to return the library book he borrowed on my card, which is now overdue.  I got a 67 on my math test, boo hoo.  I either aced or (noticeably) BSed my history test; either way I think I got a good grade on that, yay.  MCAS tomorrow, we'll see how that turns out.  I'm not sure which teacher I should get to assess me, but I'm leaning towards Mme DeRobert.  I was disappointed by the lack of comments since my first comment-available post.  According to Julia Kalow, people are just not used to the comment feature on blogs, so I should prompt them with a question.  So here it is:  Who should I get to do my teacher assessment? (PICK ONE)  a) Mme DeRobert  b) Ms. Heidlage  c) Mr. Stanley  d) Ms. Kranes  e) Ms. Srikanth  To comment, click on the "comments" link below, next to my name and the time.

       So registration was today.  Next year, I'll have no frees. I'm taking Honors Math, Honors English, AP French, AP US History, AP Biology, and more.  American Studies sucks more suckily than a sucking sucky suckfest.  That thing is getting old.  I need something new.  For gym, I'm taking World Games first semester and AM PE second semester.  Tell me if anyone else is taking those then.  Also, Driver's Ed first semester.  And I know that that was a sentence fragment.  Hopefully I won't get raped.  And the big chihuahua, I'm taking SECOND-year Spanish next year.  How did the Almeista manage that?  Because I'm so awesome.  Yeah, I definitely should refrain from calling myself "the Almeista."  Oh and Creative Writing second semester, I got the urge after writing my Loren short story.  Another sentence fragment.  And another.  OK I'll stop pointing them out now.  I may or may not be seeing "The United States of Leland" with Ben Ostrow tomorrow.  That whole plan is so fraught with peril, as Ms. Green would say.  In Mock Trial, I think I'm going to focus on Sherriff Barnes.  For those of you who don't know the case, it's a murder trial, and Barnes is the one who arrested the defendant.  The defendant allegedly killed the victim with a tire iron, so I draw a cartoon that showed him ironing his shirt with a tire.  Craig thought it was funny; Stephanie Kaplan did not.  That's another thing, there's been some controversy over calling some people by their first names and calling others by their full names.  And by some controversy I mean Jessica Li complained.  My argument is that certain people, such as Jessica Li and Stephanie Kaplan, are just always identified by their full names (by people like Duke and me); whereas others, like Melody and Orin, are always identified by their first names only.  That's just what they're called, and that's the essence of a name.  And now I'm rambling.

       Passover today; few of my teachers assigned homework.  Go Jews, with their long noses and their stinginess.  You know why Jews can't eat bread on Passover?  Because they killed Jesus.  I wonder how many people will realize I'm kidding, I can think of a few that won't... you can guess who I'm thinking of in comments and then I'll tell you if you're right.  So people's gawking at Arnaud wasn't as full-fledged as I thought it might be.  Then again, he didn't say all that much, so there you go.  An hour ago, my mother had a big fight with her sister, and then the latter went to fume in her car, and then later came back.  Don't people ever outgrow that kind of thing?

       I had a doctor's appointment after school today.  I got a shot for Hepatitis A since I'm going to the dark continent in a while; it wasn't so bad since I wasn't looking.  I'm now 5'6", having grown 1.5" from last time, and am 118 lbs, up 5 lbs.  Pretty good.  I had a bunch of teriyaki afterwards because I am really not concerned about my health at all, especially after the check-up.  I got my report card today: an A in chemistry, two A-s in history and math, respectively, two B+s in English and French, respectively, and a C+ in myth, folk tale, and science fiction.  I think that last one was because I didn't take a reading quiz on a packet I never got because I had to go to trials, but it's not worth fighting over since you can't change grades retroactively.  Whatever, not the end of the world; colleges will probably see it as me focusing on the important subjects anyway, the ones that interest me.  I hate it how teachers always say I have unexcused absences, even though I've never cut a class.  I've always had notes; they probably just lose them.  Oh well.  I also got a B on my Loren story, even though everyone who read it thought it was good and funny.  In study hall, I showed it to Jessica Li; she said parts didn't make sense, and I used too many big words.  Like "digits."  Vacation!  I drew up a plan in study hall by which by the end of the vacation, I'll have ALL of my work done, including the big research paper and the year-long suckfest.  Let's see whether I'll stick to it.  Tomorrow, I'm going to get crossed again, then I'll see "Kill Bill: Volume 2" with Daniel Waldinger and Arnaud, then I'll watch "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" at Matt K-K's house.  Let me see if there are any quotes I can end with...  "For him, it meant whatever he meant it to mean." ---Ms. Heidlage

       I love Thursdays.  It's almost the end of the week, I have pretty much all of my work done, I have second-lunch French, no chemistry, no myth, folk tale, and science fiction, and my house is clean because today is when the cleaning people come.  Yeah, I'm such a rich spoiled Jewton kid.  Plus, it's just a day away from vacation (and classes tomorrow will be a breeze), I'm acting as the defendant in a cross tonight, and there was a fire today, during which Ian and I ran around looking for our class which Loren and Jason (whom he later told) was quite hilarious.  Apparently the fire was because some kid set it to a trash can on the third floor.  In history, Eric was saying it wasn't that big of a deal, and Ms. Heidlage said, "It's a felony!" and he was like, "I'm not defending it or anything... well I am."  Yesterday, Loren showed me how to use microfilm at the library.  This disrupts the flow but I think it's worth mentioning.  Microfilm is cool.  I looked through the first three years of President Tubman's administration in Liberia, that will take me a while since it was like thiry years altogether.  I'm really impatient about my iPod mini, which won't get here for at least like a month.  I'm usually not this materialistic, I don't know.  For some reason, music has become more important to me in the past year or so.  Here are a couple more quotes from history to finish things:  "Show him the dot, Loren." ---Ms. Heidlage  "It's like cancer, but it tastes really good." ---Eric Messinger, on MSG

       So here's what happened over my weekend:   Good Friday  I went to see "The United States of Leland," which I had wanted to do for a while, with my parents and Arnaud.  I thought it was good.  You should see it.  There was also a Mock-Trial meeting from three to five; I began to work with Hiro and Ben on Barnes.   Alright Saturday  After a nine-to-eleven meeting of Mock Trial, I went to Asian Culture Night at North.  I was with Loren, Dmitri (Ian's French person), Ian, Brian, and Jonny.  It was a fun experience, but Loren overrated it in his Xanga.  Many of the acts were subpar,  especially  the banter.        "So, what's your favorite movie?"       "I think Bruce Lee movies are off the hook."       "Well, you're in for a treat, because our next act is some fantastic kung fu!"  They're always in for a treat.  It's never like,        "So, do you like martial arts?"       "No, I can't stand them, it's so stupid!"       "Well, sucks for you, because our next act is some fantastic kung fu!"   Easter Sunday  Today, pretty much all that happened was a Mock-Trial meeting, from one to five.  I did my horrible cross, after which I got admonished, but I did do some contributive things.  And then there was the really short blackout, after which the following conversation between Loren and me, respectively, occured:        "It was like for half a second!"       "I know, it was less than a second!"  But I said it refutitively.  If that's a word.

       This song is more meish.  And that shouldn't be read "maysh."  Spoon is a good band.  There were so many quotes from Mock Trials today.  "I saw Fran Lewis there, she was making a pay phone." ---Gaby Bernstein [as] Pat Winter  "Mistah Wintah, you ah heahby deputized!" ---Ben Hodes [as] Sheriff Barnes  "I washed my hands clean... of the DIRT that had been on them!" ---Ben Hodes [as] Pat Winter, explaining what the character did after the murder  "...And then I got promoted!" ---PJ Hannon [as] Pat Winter, continuing the explanation  "It's a case of verbal diarrhea." ---Graham Neray  "It's like the New Hampshire of the South." ---Gabe Gladstone, describing the lax gun-control laws in Florida  -How did you analis - analysize -" -ANALYZE! -Sound it out. ---Andrew Habermehl, Gaby Bernstein, and PJ Hannon, respectively  "She was spilling menorahs all over the place." ---Hiro Tanaka   On other notes, my room is so unclean, almost entirely due to French junk and bedding.  I can't work when it's like this.  I guess I could clean it up partially, but then I just think that it's gonna clean itself in a week anyways.  Idk.  And then there are things that are none of my business.  I like writing you-suck essays a lot more than you-don't-suck essays.  But I'm still going to get a B-.  And, to end, a dialogue that happened at last night's Mock Trials:  Martin Rotemberg: "And you're suing Pinnacle Paper Company for damages, right?" PJ Hannon: "For my husband's death... What?!  This is Massachusetts!"

       ::Edit::  1. Stephanie Kaplan is so like Stephanie Kaplan.  She never goes to the West Newton, she has never heard of Walden Pond, and when the quote I used in today's post came up, I was like "and it's universal so people outside MT can understand it" and she was like "unless they are like retarded" and I was like "yeah hey maybe" and she was like "or blind."  Oh me-an.  2. I figured out something.

       Hey y'all.  The song is from Loren's stuffs (and used to be his Xanga song) because I'm still waiting on Ian giving me a username for his server, and this is actually a decent chino song.  Here's a review of my vacation so far:   Friday  Doctor's appointment, report card, good conversations   Saturday  Slept through MT, saw "Kill Bill: Volume 2" with Dan Waldinger and Arnaud, hung out with Dan and Arnaud in Newtonville, went to Matt KK's house and watched "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" on his huge-screen TV with him and Jonny   Sunday  MT, good conversations   Monday  Saw the first male runners of the marathon, went to Rockport with Ian, Arnaud, Dmitri, and my father   Tuesday  Hiked up the Great Blue Hill with my father and brother, beating them severely (figuratively speaking), had my first frappe in a while, acted as judge giving realistic decisions at MT   Wednesday  Went with my father to Clark & White to pick up his new car (he leases), ate at Cabot's, had fun with Loren and Melody who spontaneously showed up at my house, presented new tire-plug theory at MT   Thursday  (Today) Ate lunch with Jonny, John, and Arnaud at Newtonville Pizza, went with my father to Walden Pond to walk around   I hope everyone else is having as good a time.  I went to CVS with Loren yesterday after Melody left, and I was buying these things, and also I gave them the application thing for the "ExtraCare" card which is apparently so they can like keep tabs on you (but as I said to my father and brother on GBH, "I don't mind if I get spied on if I get like a dollar off or something,") and then I only brought eight dollars but my things cost like eleven, and Loren didn't have any extra money, so I was going to use my debit card, but then forgot my PIN (now I remember), and then so I was like "Can I like unget something?" and then the girl had to ring everything up again, and meanwhile behind me this long line was forming and there was this mother with little kids and I heard her like "I don't know what the hold-up is!"  That was embarrassing but funny.  GBH is like a thousand feet, and I climbed it in like five minutes, so Kilimanjaro really must not be that bad.  And apparently most of it is like a gradual going up, with just a little steep part at the end, plus we'll have porters, so I truly don't know for what I was supposed to have been getting in shape.  Rockport, always fun.  The Loren-Melody thing was actually like a compromise that was made after I was seeming to try to curve a situation in a certain way, even though I wasn't really, and apparently Loren wanted it to turn out a different way.  Either way, though, it ended up being really fun.   Juliet: "You yourself are hard of hearing, aren't you?" Luba: "And then she should be like, 'What?'"

I've eaten really greasy teriyaki like three nights a week for the past year and I've gained so little weight. x. color: I've been torn between green and brown for a long time, which goes to show how little I have going on.

Or no.  I don't feel like counting, it would take a while.  Then again twelve if you count the barely-visible ones. x. of things in my past that I regret: Since I see things year-by-year, I'll only consider this (school) year.  I've made four mistakes this year.  | describe what you are | x. wearing now: My I'm-so-sexy a.k.a. dragon/puma shirt, boxers, sweatpants. x. wishing: Well there are things I want, and I don't mean like material things, but I wouldn't say I'm wishing for them. x. doing after this: Maybe read a chapter in  Dracula  for myth, folk tale, and sci fi, then MT. x. eating: Right now, nothing.  The last thing I ate was chocolate-chip pancakes. x. looking forward to in the upcoming months: I'm not really "looking forward" to much, but the biggest things I'm anticipating in the upcoming months are going to Rockport, not having to wear my retainer in the daytime, Arnaud leaving, getting my iPod mini, national MT, finals, school being over, Tanzania, and George leaving, in that order x. digesting: My chocolate-chip pancakes. x. deathly afraid of: Not much.  | do you | x. like candles: They're not a few of my favorite things.  And no I am not going to break out in song. x. like incense: It's alright, but I wouldn't spend money on it. x. believe in love: Yes, but it's complicated almost wherever you apply it, especially for me right now. x. believe in soul mates: No, this sort of relates to what I was telling Melody a while back, but I don't think it can be explained in a blog. x. believe in love at first sight: Not per se. x. believe in forgiveness: Yes.  I think if I'm going to be a lawyer I'll either be a prosecutor or a public defender.  So I should be saying absolutely not/absolutely. x. wish there was something you could understand better: Nothing springs to mind.

       So I talked to Ms. Richardson today, thus ending that boring blog saga.  She said that since I wasn't here for half the term, she had too little on which to base my grade, and that I do A- work.  Colleges don't (for the most part) see term grades anyway, and since there were so few grades this term, it won't bear that heavily on my final grade.  What else...  I got my first team sweatshirt at Mock Trials today, but according to Steph, it will be too hot to wear it for the rest of the year.  I wore it a little bit today, though, because gym was cold.  Archery is fun, especially now that Ms. Perkins told me what I was doing wrong.  Dan Jung is strange; he was complaining about how this black girl kept talking to him, even though he was talking to her plenty.  ER: The Complete Second Season came today.  Yay.  Chemistry test tomorrow.  Boo.  Arnaud leaves tomorrow.  Yay.  Nationals starting Wednesday.  Yay.  Loren doesn't like my song.  Too bad.  I don't know how to end this, so I'm just doing one-line paragraphs.  Wait, let me see if I have any quotes... Aw heck, I'll just steal the one Loren wrote down because I was in that class and he'll probably never get around to posting it anyway.  "I was never hungry enough to eat anybody in college, but... it did happen." ---Mr. Barry

       Hey.  I finally got webpost.com to work, so now I can have whatever music I want on my blog (in other words, I can post it myself).  The problem is, some of my favorite songs are large, so it would take forever to load them.  This one is another one by Spoon, I might fish around with music for a little while.  Arnaud leaves Friday.  I think you know how I feel about this (hint: I'll have my own room again).  New MUN issue, Security Council reform, adding non-permanent and permanent members.  I spoke, used my full minute, and talked pretty fast; I hope that didn't detract from my arguments.  I learned that there is a very low likelihood that Ms. Richardson will change my grade, even though it is low of no fault of mine.  So I'm letting that one go.  I talked to this vegan kid who apparently might have been in my first-grade class at Schecter, that was interesting.  I'm thinking of writing more; we'll see how that goes (if at all).  My English teacher just assigned a paragraph on the purposes and goals of education.  That seems so arbitrary and like suspicious.  Oh, and we watched part of "Scotland, PA" in English today, that was quite entertaining.  And here's a quote from chemistry.  Alex Gollick always has interesting things to say.   "Kelvin is exactly 3." ---Alex Gollick

       Albert Camus is somewhat cool.  Plus I wanted to change the picture to something 1) originalish and 2) meaningfulish.  I don't want the layout to be just a copy of nyokglitter's; I want my blog to be (more or less) my own.  Vacation is over.  School approaches.  And that's the way we get back to where we get by.

       I am so wet.  It was awfully hot in school today, and yet it was raining uncontrollably starting E-block.  Otherwise it was fun.  I realized something funny to say in math: "Inequalities are so racist.  Separate but equal?  I don't think so."  Archery was good again; I was on Monica's team.  In French, Ian and I disrupted the class by laughing noticeably at this picture in the workbook of three students who had written "2+2=5," "2+2=6," and "2+2=7," respectively; we didn't notice why it was there until chemistry.  In chemistry, Matt and I noticed a folder on Ms. Srikanth's iBook called "ARNAV," (her son's name) and a file called "dream india," and we thought it would be cool if there was someone named Norman T. Gorman whose parents told to be Mormon.  Ms. Heidlage is back, she spent the whole class talking about her trip to China.  That was fun, and the following quotations were said (the first was intentional and educational):  "Capitalism is man against man; socialism is the other way around." ---Ms. Heidlage  "I obviously knew Washington founded the country and Lincoln freed the slaves.  But like I didn't know FDR played ping pong." ---Jake G-A  This post is so Melodyesque.

       Right now it's like the worst of both worlds.  There are the bad parts of summer, heat, humidity, and insects; but still the work of school.  Namely this huge research paper on Liberia on which I've still only done seven substantive note cards.  On the plus side, I feel kind of like a history detective because I've been using so much microfilm.  But then I messed up one of the microfilms and it caused a big fiasco with the librarians; oh well.  I also saw Jeremy at CVS; he tried to talk to me but I was still out of it on account of the heat.  At least I'll only have one real assignment left come Monday.  And then there's been a little bit of a resurgence in The Issue, but it's too hoooooot to think about that right now.  Oh, and I missed such a good opportunity today when I was asking Melody how her weekend had been and she was like, "annoying" "it's hot," and I should have been like, "yeah, I have that problem all the time."

       I aced that history quest on WWII/the Cold War.  Like man, how smart can I get?  Pretty darn so.  I would say "and modest too" but that's such a tired joke.  Loren thought NSC-68 was a conference, and he got so many badly wrong answers on his interro.  Sorry Duke, but dude.  I feel kind of bad about how I act regarding Jessica Li.  She's a good girl.  Yesterday I turned in a movie-note sheet to Ms. Heidlage on which I had written a quotation.  I'm trying to remember it.  Oh yeah.   The Cold War was fought in a narrow tunnel. --- Eric Messinger     I'm also thinking of seeing a movie over the week, since we'll barely have any homework because of MCAS, maybe "Bon Voyage."  It's French and at a good theater that we can walk to without an adult.  And with the "we" here I'm thinking Loren, but it could be any of you people or others who don't read it.  Like Dan Jung.  Ok so get back to me on that.  Everyone likes my story, except Jason, who can go suck a lemon.  Which are actually good so Jason can go suck a prune for his laxative problems.  And Julia said that it was "good for a sophomore."  Oh, and I wrote my election speech for S-G of MUN.  Even though my chances aren't good, that doesn't mean you shouldn't vote for me; it won't be any better if Dan Asher wins by ten votes instead of by eleven, and you know that I would be a cool S-G.  Gabe says part of my speech is bad; I like it.  And that goshforsaken essay; at least when I'm done I'll have like one significant assignment left for the rest of the year.    Alex : So anyways, Ben... wait Ben is your name, right?  Ben : [thumbs up]  Alex : I'm sorry; Ben is such a generic name.  Ben : It is a generic name.  It also means "right hand of God."

       I have decided to post the short story that I wrote on the airplane coming back from Orlando.  The main character represents Stephanie, and the other character (other than the pilot) represents myself.  The implication that she likes me has been fictionalized.  All else is true.     Going Back  by Alexander Dietz    	“We are beginning our descent.”  	The pilot spoke as they all do, mechanically, matter-of-factly; you knew how he was going to say it quite accurately before the thing was said.  Even so, it touched her more deeply than if she had been hit by a baseball.  For now, she was coming home.  For now, she was going back.  	The trip had only lasted a few days, but it had taken her away from herself.  This is not to say that it was exciting or fantastic on any objective level, but it did let her catch a few breaths and look at things as what they were.  She did not know whether she liked it like that.  Although the holiday was a welcome one, she missed her family, her friends, and her quotidian life.  	She brushed back her long, silken hair before returning her tray table to its full upright and locked position.  She was very pretty – you wouldn’t say “hot” or “fine” like you would for those big-breasted, big-butted girls who flaunt themselves, but she still had quite a body, and when you caught a glimpse of her face, it was hard to look away.  The curves of her cheeks, the slope of her chin, and oh, those eyes; those eyes always knew how to get your attention.  	They were at twenty thousand feet.  	She thought of her world, the world to which she was coming back, the world where she had learned to become who she was.  He was there; she was quite aware of this, but she did not know how she should deal with it, what she should do, whether she should act at all.  	They had known each other for some time now.  She knew, she thought she knew, how he felt about her.  She had decided that she didn’t like him – yes, she liked him, but she didn’t like him.  Of course not.  He was foolish, he wasn’t the best-looking guy, he thought too much of himself, he had made some choices that she knew were immoral, and he didn’t even seem to regret them.  She wasn’t sure if he even respected her, given some of the things he had said.  That wasn’t the reason they weren’t together, mind you.  She just didn’t like him.  Not like that.  	But there was something there.  She couldn’t put a name on it, and it didn’t mean anything.  Did it?  They understood each other, and they had something, but it was probably just something platonic.  He still loved her, though.  There were other girls, and things change, but he still loved her.  On the other hand, there were definitely other guys.  	Should they just keep things the way they are?  It was working out, for what it was worth, and if anything happened, it would probably end worse than if nothing happened.  They had been down that road before.  Most likely, it would take them to the same place.  Wouldn’t it?  	“We have arrived at the international airport.  Local time is 1:03 pm.  We hope you enjoyed your flight, and thank you for choosing us.”  	She looked out the window.  It was raining, but it didn’t matter.

       New Blogger, new blog.  I've been at the library a lot recently, I don't know why.  Maybe because when I'm at home I rarely do any work.  Also I've been waiting for this CD to be there that keeps getting away from me.  Ms. Srikanth is so cool; on Tuesday we're going to have a long-block playtime.  Today I finished  L'Etranger , which turned out well.  Not well like happy ending but well like good ending.  Also, I have announced officially my candidacy for Secretary-General of Model UN.  I wrote my campaign speech today, and I have several good ideas for how to improve the club.  For example:      1. A Model UN blog, on which all members will be able to post their views on the issue.      2. The usage of Webpost.com to put working papers and resolutions online, linked from a central place on the aforementioned blog.      3. The usage of AIM to have group discussions– which, unlike Yahoo! Messenger, people actually have.      4. The introduction of topics the week of the voting of the previous one, allowing delegates a chance to prepare before each first issue meeting.   We have a lot of words that end in the same thing... like '-son.'  I don't know what it means, but... --- Ms. Heidlage

       Nationals were very fun.  We had four trials in Orlando, Florida, facing Missouri, South Carolina, Kentucky, and Washington, respectively.  South Carolina ended up winning.  We placed twelfth, which is the best any Massachusetts team has done since 1990 - and that time it was Newton North too.  Stephanie was right; this was an awesome experience.  I can't think of much to say that doesn't sound formulaic, not that what I've already said hasn't been so.  I have so much to do; luckily I have a week to do the big Liberia essay, and who knows how long to do the commentaries.  I thought I was going to get so much done, and I didn't do any work.  Even so, I don't regret it.  I also wrote another short story, mostly while on the plane (and you can tell).  I don't know whether to post it.  Tell me if you think I should.  South Carolina's opening statement began with "All roads lead to Rome," and they went on to say that all roads led to the defendant, for she was the murderer.  During that, Josh, one of our lawyer-coaches and technically the state coordinator, wrote that additionally, Rome wasn't built in a day- but the prosecution's case was.  Later on, at the banquet, Ben Hodes said, "All roads lead to my ass."  Josh also told this really funny joke while we were at Disney's Typhoon Lagoon (where we had to remain fully-clothed for some reason).  I'll tell it if you want; it has to be spoken out loud.  At Typhoon Lagoon, part of the group - including Gaby - were separated from the rest when we were going to leave.  Elliott was wondering where they were, and Ben said, "Gaby is probably on her knees right now."  Elliott scowled at him, and he added, "... praying  that she'll find us in time!"

       I realize that as a result of my posting now, few people will take the initiative to see whether there are comments on yesterday's post, so I will tell you: there are; Melody's and mine in response thereto; so go look at them.  In case you're wondering why I'm posting every day pretty much nowadays, it's because I've been bored lately and haven't had much to do that I like to do, and because posting is fun.  In case you have some beef about my doing so, keep in mind that Stephanie said that everyday posts were preferable, and that between Loren's blog and his Xanga he pretty much updates every day so I match him- except that blog posts are always more meaningful than Xanga ones.  So "Bon Voyage" was a good movie; it was no "Monsieur Ibrahim" but it was worth seeing.  I learned a new idiomatic expression; this one character was saying to another character "Qu'est-ce que te prends?" and they translated it as "What's wrong with you?"  Yeah, as that girl says (can I use that name?), "nerdy nerdy."  Speaking of which, I thought of another name for Stephanie: "that other girl," in that she's that girl's counterpart except that she doesn't like me/isn't good friends with me.  Also speaking of a different which, I was looking through my dictionary, and I came across the entry for "hypocrite," and guess whose picture I saw next to it?  Jason Sullivan's.  That's right, Jason Sullivan plays "Warcraft: 3."  Like oh me-an.  That is like the nerdiest thing anyone could do ever.  Like even nerds say that people who do that are nerds.  Dinner tonight at the Shens' was fun; Yin's parents and brother were also there.  We played "Super Smash Bros." and Chen (sp?) and Amy kept pulling a Pamela, i.e., laughing hysterically at unfunny things for extended periods of time.  People, come online...  While we were playing, the following quote arose (in the tradition of "What the?  He can kick me while I'm firing him?"), and that'll be it for today:   It's so annoying when you grab me while I'm bouncing! --- Jason Shen

       It's so annoying when no one's online.  Not much happened today, but that doesn't mean there isn't stuff to talk about...  I was listening to music today before/after my nap, and I came upon one of those songs that like fits my situation.  Except that sometimes things fit situations too well, and that's not necessarily cool.  The weather has been so nice lately.  I think that's why I've been going to the library; for the walk home.  Speaking of walks home from the library, it's so weird how Melody talks for Loren at times, like I saw them (I saw him first), and so I was like "Hi, Loren," (except my throat had some stuff in it that I didn't realize because I hadn't talked since to Niko when school ended), and Melody was like, "Hi, Alex," and we walked past each others.  I say each others because there were two of them.  That was a little awkward; but of course, what isn't with me and those two together?  I always feel bad when Ms. Heidlage tells me to stop talking.  This was during "To Live," and I was actually asking Loren a question relevant to the movie (what this chino thing said on a guy's oh-no-I'm-a-reactionary sign).  W/e.  That's about it.  No quotations since yesterday.  If anyone wants to come with Daniel Waldinger and me to "Bon Voyage" tomorrow (things changed), s/he is welcome.

       Mr. Mitchell, my MCAS proctor, is so unreasonable.  I know he believes in the whole "purity of the examination" and all, but he goes a little too far.  After everyone has finished, he doesn't let us talk, doesn't let us whisper, doesn't let us signal to each other, doesn't even let us pass notes -- and today everyone finished over an hour early.  I couldn't even listen to music quietly.  Me-an.  Matt (K-K), if you're reading this, call me and tell me what, if anything, is going down tomorrow.  Then there was Loren and Melody and their awkwardness.  Ms. Heidlage told us about these two independent studies that we could do next year.  They both sound interesting, though I already have so much going on then.  One of them is focused around a book, which I checked out at the library today, where I saw Jonny, who I told something funny, which I had said to Dan Jung.  I know it's unethical to quote oneself (but, as I learned from a movie I watched yesterday, not immoral); too bad.    Dan Jung : So how was MCAS?  Alex : Are you kidding?  Easier than a Lithuanian prostitute.   In history, we're watching this chino movie called "To Live."  That produced the context of the following quotation that I misinterpreted as a threat.   Do you like 'To Live?' --- Matt Woolf    During MCAS yesterday, we were filling out the questionnaire, and Mr. Mitchell was like, "The answer to number seven is 'E'" and I thought it would be funny if the answer was like "I use marijuana 5+ times per week."  Then in French, on which Loren has been sitting in for the past two days, we're watching this movie called "Monsieur Batignole," and one of the characters, a boy, said "J'ai peur du noir!" which Ian translated fairly accurately as "I'm afraid of black!"  Loren has been so sexist in regard to "To Live."  He kept complaining about how the wife keeps crying, and the most recent time I was like, "It's her daughter's wedding, I think she has license," and then he was like, "Yeah, but then she also cried when her son died," and I was like "Yeah geez."  He also said the following comment:   It must be great to have a mute wife. --- Loren Chen    Oh me-an.  It's a good thing Loren is so timid and impressionable by his ladyfriends.  And finally, a line from "To Live":   After the ox is communism! --- Fugui , from "To Live"

       Yay, MCAS.  I remember in Day when I wrote a pro-MCAS editorial just to be controversial.  Also because I support it.  It's so easy and fun.  I can't believe how long some people took, especially Stephanie, Szeman, Sarah, and Madi.  All girls.  Go figure.  Some of them took like more than an hour longer than I took for the first part.  If anybody wants to see "Bon Voyage" with me after school tomorrow or the next day, tell me so.  The Matt thing is fizzling out, though he still says he can do it Friday.  But that's too far away, and I want to go to see it now.  Kickball during chemistry today was alright.  Also, before that, talking with Matt Woolf at lunch was fun.  Oh, and props to Stephanie for lending me the season finale of "The O.C.," that was good.  Also, a couple of nights ago a good short-story idea came to me.  Maybe I'll write it eventually.   So I'll call out your names and you just say whether you're here. --- Mr. Mitchell , my MCAS proctor

       So as you may have been able to tell from my last post, I finally finished the big Liberia essay.  It ended up being ten substantive pages, along with an annotated bibliography, a first draft, and a million note cards.  Yeah, go me.  Then today I ran for secretary-general of Model UN.  I didn't expect to win, given that everyone was supporting Dan Asher, who did win, and who was really the better candidate.  Good people also won for undersecretary-general, including Madi who did this cool haiku thing with Aviva on bongos (though I didn't vote for her).  I think she may have gotten the idea from the poems I always put on my interrogations de verbes which she sometimes corrects; maybe not.  Anyways, good job everyone, including Matt K-K (also for whom I didn't vote).  Cool, my iPod mini just came.  See y'all later!   Oh also, I said some good quotations today but I can't post them myself so check Duke's blog.

       Being sick is no fun.  You know all those people who are like, yay, I'm sick?  Neither do I.  I did go to Rockport today, though, and that was fun.  But then again, I haven't written any more commentaries, and I still have like twenty-nine left to write.  On the plus side, things have gotten a little more interesting again, thanks to some cool people.  Go vagueness.  And one- to two-line paragraphs.  And sentence fragments.

       ::Edit::  Oh yeah, I forgot.  Loren was explaining why oxen are castrated bulls, and said that if they weren't castrated they would be thinking about cows all day, and that the slogan of the International Bull Association was the following:   I don't want to pull a plow; I want to do a cow. --- Loren Chen

       School has been pretty fun recently.  Like two days ago in French, I was in Melody's group for this thing where we had to come up with sentences for idiomatic expressions, and I thought she spelled something wrong (turns out I was wrong), so when I was "fixing" it, I was trying to make it look like girl handwriting, so I put a little heart over the "i" and then Mme DeRobert came over and was like what the so I was like, don't all girls do that?  That was funny.  Then yesterday in French, we finished writing our trial skit for  L'Etranger , and our group and another group kept covertly swiping and swiping back my French-English dictionary.  And we ended up with a good skit; I won't say what was funny about it because at least one reader (of five) is in my French class.  Guess which.  Ooo, tough.  English today was...interesting...   This looks like an orgy to me! --- Ms. Kranes    Then history was good, Somers and I were in a group together which has never happened before.  We were for "Promot[ing] Western Values" in the Middle East.  When Loren heard what I was supporting, he was like, figures, and I was like it's such chino thinking the one he was doing, which was like suppress everyone with the military.  Then he did an impression of an Arab person, and was like, "Can I..." and the military goes "No!" and starts beating him up.  During lunch, Melody referred to Loren as "the skinny Chinese kid."  That was weird.  After school, I got myself a haircut at that Newtonville place.  Go sexy-haired me.  And no more seniors...   Does "C" exist on the periodic table? --- Ms. Srikanth    I am sexually interested in you. -- Matt Woolf ,  to me

       Not much like amazing has happened since Saturday, but Stephanie (now I can't call her "that other girl" because I can't call Melody "that girl" and the one is a variation of the other) wants me to post, so I shall.  Lately I've been following the dangling-preposition rule almost without fail.  According to her, "ive noticed actually."  By the way, sorry if the beginning of this post is a little too Stephocentric, but I fell asleep today so now I'm kind of half-asleep so my long-term memory isn't good, and so I tend to rely on what's happened recently.  She also pulled a Summer a minute ago.  For those of you who don't remember, a while ago, Summer didn't realize Seth was Jewish, even though she calls him "Cohen."  Likewise, Steph didn't realize that Jason  Sullivan  had any Irish blood in him.  I was reading  Bless Me, Ultima  for English today (that's what caused me to fall asleep), and it's partly in Spanish (I understood a little thereof, like "¡Que lastima!") and it turns out that "cuentos," the word I use to make fun of Jason's Portuguosity, is a real word.  It means "stories."  I don't know how much sense that made the way I used it.  Also: everyone start saying "yesterblock" (meaning the previous block) in your everyday conversation.  I want to make it into a word.  Yesterday was the Model UN BBBQ.  The extra "B" stands for "BYOBB."  What's that extra "B" for?  That's a typo.  It was fun; mostly I talked to Loren and froshmen, while Loren did things for which he should be internet-punched.  Over the weekend, I had planned to do all of my commentaries, and I ended up doing none.  ¡Que lastima!  And then I've been thinking about The Issue and its many, many nuances, and I haven't been able to come to any definite conclusions.  None seems both practical and positive.  A long while ago, at the end of first term, I was angry with my math grade so I argued with Mr. Stanley about why Jonny got such a perfectish score when he never paid attention and rarely did homework, and he said that participation didn't matter.  Then a few days ago, I got a warning from Ms. Richardson saying that I don't participate enough.  I'm not trying to make a point about when participation is necessary, I'm just saying that I got a bum deal.  Now, since there isn't anything else that's any of the public's business, I'll get on with the quotes and see y'all tomorrow.    I don't want to interrupt, but I do want to interrupt. --- Ms. Kranes     As for Mr. Gradgrind and Sissy, they're both pretty high also. --- Michaela Yule

       Skits in French today were fun, though I messed up somewhat.  Matt Woolf raised my chemistry grade from 9% to 95%.  Did he ever know that he's my hero?  Oh, and I said a quotation related to Matt Woolf that Melody thought was funny and so wrote down.  Maybe she will start quoting.  'Course she doesn't have a blog, so she can't blockquote, but w/e.  I don't know how Loren and I survived through those pioneer days before blockquotes.  Steph thought I was annoying today in my making fun of her.  Whadayagannado.  Oh, and I saw the sex episode of "The O.C." that she wanted me to see, that was pretty good.  Yesterday, I saw "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring," this movie from one of the Koreas, probably the lower one, with Daniel Waldinger.  It was cool.  Steph deplored me for not going to more popular movies/theatres; I deplored her for wanting to exercise indoors.  Some people are like that.  The Steph part, that is.  Anything else...?  No.  Well, new song.  Red Hot Chili Peppers.

         Finals   Chemistry and English no longer exist.  I ehhed on chemistry, but even if I had done them randomly, I probably would have gotten a score high enough for me to get an A.  Plus I did a bunch of bonus problems, on which I could not fail.  It was annoying, though, when it was like:    Proctor : I'm handing out your t--  Matt Woolf : I'm done!  He also discovered seventeen new subatomic particles and won three Nobel prizes while he was taking it.  I BSed my essay on evil for English, but I think I got a fairly good grade anyway.     Template   I thought it needed some color.     Midday   After being reproached for being George's brother by Mr. Ibokette while I was getting my new AP US History textbook, Loren decided to pull an ew.  I said it that way because people really shouldn't say "ew" when it isn't something disgusting; they use it much too often.  Even so, lunch and Robert Coopering turned out alright.  I also went to "Sugar Mama's" for the first time.  It's weird how I only got that just now, the reference.     My Essay (Below)   kappy125: i really like your essay!  ;-)     This Weekend   Let's face it, I'm not going to be studying for math and French and history the entire weekend.  I want to do something with somebody.  Loren wants to see "The Notebook," but etc.  I also want to see that.  But then if I saw it with him, people like Steph would not approve.  Nevertheless, as Arnaud put it once when he and George were making noise during a kissing scene in "ER" and I was telling them to be quiet,   Ahlex eez a rrromahnteek gai. --- Arnaud Forestier    "The Stepford Wives" is also out.

       Today was the last day of learning classes.  Pretty fun.  After school, I went to the library, and Szeman very graciously let me look at her notes.  I don't know how I'm going to do, though.  I misspoke today in history.  We were talking about the Middle East briefly:    Ms. Heidlage : And they have theocracies.  Noah Jampol : What's that?  Me : Rule by the government.   This is an awfully empty-looking post, so I'll put the essay that I wrote yesterday for English about the progression that took place in my writing over the year:   How My Writing Became Sophomoric    	Every year, often imperceptibly, the style with which I approach education changes.  It is not my expansion of knowledge that proves to be the most significant growth; it is the small shifts in my behavior toward my schoolwork.  Writing has demonstrated this the most bluntly.  In the beginning of this sophomore year, I had a prosy, self-important air in my essays.  As the year went on, as most students, I grew tired, and began doing each assignment with a set formula.  By the end, I had realized the need to express myself in my writing, and that, along with the flaws I learned to correct, made me respect my work.  Throughout this year, I took great steps in transforming my English ability, helping me to understand how to use my own voice, engagingly and effectively.  	 When I entered room 348 in September, I thought I had it all figured out.  I had learned “the formula” in middle school, and I used that to churn out virtually every essay I wrote.  All I had to know, I thought, was introduction, body, conclusion, with topic sentences, closing sentences, supporting evidence, and a thesis thrown in there somewhere.  My natural inclination to prevent each paper from being The Most Boring Essay In The World, then, was to use flowery language at critical points.  For example, I used classical allusions and metaphors every so often, as this line from my first essay of the year (the “I am proud of being…, but it’s not without its problems” assignment): “The students and educators of the past two years have argued that to take five honors classes is to steer toward Kharybdis.”  Understandably, above the last word I found the following written on my paper when I got it back: “??!”  This arrogant style made for some decent grades, but some writing of which I am not proud.  	Around the middle of the year, I noticed that I had become stuck in a creative rut.  After months of conditioning, I found that all I would do was the formula.  There was no creativity, no personality, no insight, and no fun in my writing.  Papers such as Black Boy responses made this especially evident.  I hate analyzing literature; I always have, I do, and I believe that I always will.  I believe that books and poetry are meant to be read and enjoyed (though I rarely find poetry enjoyable), not dissected.  Bob Dylan is often credited as refusing to “reveal” the meaning of his songs, for he thought that they meant whatever the listener thought they meant.  It’s just music.  It’s just art.  It’s just entertainment.  As a result, I was completely disinterested in the kind of writing done in English class, and I fell back on the kind of formulaic way that I could use while barely thinking about it.  Added to my apathy was the subject matter: racism.  Truthfully, I do not particularly care about racism.  Perhaps it is because it has been hammered into me by English and other politically correct classes for so long.  Perhaps it was the fact that almost every chapter of Black Boy had the same message, and let’s face it, that’s annoying.  Because of these factors, I turned off.  I had no reason to read the comments that were written on my papers, because I had no reason to improve.  I did not write because I wanted to write, as I am doing now.  I wrote because it was assigned, and it had to get done.  	About three months ago, I had a revelation that changed my writing forever.  It came in the form of a short story about looking at another’s hands.  I chose my friend’s, because I had some moderately funny things to say at them; at least, they would be funny between us.  For example, I made light of how his hands were anorexic, yellow, and feminine.  I fulfilled the requirements of the assignment, and had fun doing it.  I wrote all of the interesting thoughts I had while I was thinking about his hands, actually made a decent point about society, and infused a lot of my own language, my own voice, into it.  The last few sentences of my paper exemplify these things well:  	“Alex,” he questions apathetically, “I forget.  Who was Mustafa Kemal again?” 	I say to myself, back to the drudgery of school, back to this place that produced the very same cycle in which Loren is trapped and in which I may be doomed to fall. 	But dammit, who the crap was Mustafa Kemal?  I think that I got a B on that assignment.  I can’t find it.  Even so, I prefer having received a B on a paper I liked and that my peers liked (I put it on my blog) than a technically sound but boring paper. I enjoyed doing that so much that later on, on the plane back from the mock trials national championship in Orlando, I wrote another short story entirely for fun, and posted it on my blog.  Here, I expressed myself even more honestly, and again, my friends liked it.  When I enjoy my work and it is entertaining to others, I feel that I have done my job.  	I went through a great number of assignments in English this year before arriving at my grand conclusion about English in the recent past: that being entertaining is nine-tenths of being a good writer.  I moved from formula and pretension to burning out and being left with formula, and finally realizing that I could indeed have fun while doing homework.  I accept that my grades on these papers are not the highest they could be, and that my new style (which in fact transferred almost directly from the style I use on my blog) and its colloquialisms and jokes are sometimes lost on my baby-boomer teachers.  Maybe my writing would not impress Charles Dickens, but frankly, his does not impress me.  When my generation inherits the world, its writers not be composing to entertain nineteenth-century English newspaper fiction writers.  Its writers will be composing to entertain their peers.  After I had posted my “hands” short story on my blog, one of my friends told me that she was laughing the whole time she was reading it.  That is the only grade I need.

       George has graduated.  It was hot today.  The chemistry final is Friday.  I left chemistry early because she said that those who did not want to review could leave.

       Today was pretty good.  I finally handed in the year-long project, after getting an hour and a half of sleep.  It turned out pretty darned well in my opinion.  Pretty gosh-darn well.  Better than Jessica Li's, anyways, but I'm angry that Eleanor had to raise the bar so high.  Speaking of whom, Loren prostrated himself again in front of Jessica Li today; that is getting annoying.  I saw things passionately today.  I don't mean that I had an emotional reaction to the issues of my life or anything; more like I saw my surroundings with an emotional response, like a painting.  It was probably because after we watched "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" in myth, folk tale, and science fiction, my eyes weren't adjusted to the light.  Which reminds me, I don't understand why my teacher complains that I don't participate when we just watch movies all the time.  Yesterday, I went to school for this Tanzania car wash.  I was the only one who showed up, and I left after fifteeen minutes.  I so want to punch that group, except for like three people.  Today I decided to go to the library a few hours after school.  A CD that I had wanted had finally come in, and I got it.  It's the source of the song that will be on my blog at the beginning of the next school year.  Very exciting.  I also saw the President on the way back.  Oh yeah, in history, Ms. Heidlage was telling us about this essay we're going to write on the final about free-market democracy, and I thought that Gabe should start his, "My fellow Americans..."  Then some stuff happened with Steph that was resolved half an hour ago.  Here are some quotations from the movie we watched in history about Israeli and Palestinian children:   It's their land, but we don't want to blow up.  It's complicated. --- An Israeli parent   from  Promises    Don't speak Israeli [Hebrew] in the camp because the Arabs don't like anything. --- A Palestinian child   from  Promises

       Man...  I finished cleaning my room today.  It is now very clean.  Unfortunately, it is also too hot nowadays.  And my plan seems to be beginning to fall apart.  " urlLink Control Room ," the movie in question, "is not worth [Melody's] time or money."  But then when I was talking to her on the phone she asked her father whether she could go.  That girl is confusing.  So as for Loren and John, they also seem ambiguous.  I was about to say something to John but then I remembered he's too cool to read my blog.  Anyways maybe I need to get some substitutes.  Like Craiggers.  I've been saying the word "awexomezors" a lot recently.  I think I'll stop.  Well saying it online anyways, maybe I'll start saying it out loud.  And then get shot.  In other news, Daniel Waldinger is a cool kid.  Have you seen the music video for this?  It's freaky.  And apparently Michael Stipe is a director now.   urlLink      Have you ever seen the televised St. Vitus subcommittee prize Investigation dance? Those ants-in-pants glances. Well, look behind the eyes It's a hallowed, hollow anesthesized "save my own ass, screw these guys" smoke and mirror lock down.

       Sophomore year is effectively over.  After staying up late to do my memorandum, then this morning writing my outline and then going to John's house and hanging out with John, Loren, and Bao-Bao, I did pretty well on my history final.  My essay ended up being the same length as that of Matt Woolf, and I think I made my point effectively.  I also finished like twenty-five minutes early.  The following is the plan I have for Friday, open to suggestions.  I'm thinking of having Loren, John, and Melody come (in addition to myself).  I tried to make it as multilateral as possible, but I haven't gotten anybody's official, unequivocal assent yet.  12:00- Meet at John's house, go to lunch in Newtonville, maybe Cabot's for a change  1:00- Stop at my house, maybe do something briefly (e.g., badminton), then walk to the Embassy  1:50- Matinée, "Control Room," starts at the Embassy; go  urlLink here  and click on "TRAILER" on the bottom left to see the trailer.  How about it?

I don't know what yet.  If I decide something then I'll post it or something.  I am tout à fait confused, and no it is not heeheeifying.  It doesn't make sense to me.  I don't understand.

       This will be my last post before I leave.  Tomorrow is the build-up day.  We will fly out the next day from Logan, stopping in Zurich (Switzerland) and then arriving in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.  There's going to be a barbecue at my house in two hours (at five), after which we're apparently going to "Farenheit 9/11" at the West Newton.  People other than Jonny, who is already coming, are welcome.  I both anticipate and apprehend the trip, but I'm sure that it will be interesting and entertaining.  For anyone who doesn't already know, I'm going to be there for a month, climb Mt. Kilimanjaro, go on safari, and more.  By "more" I of course mean get AIDS and malaria and die, but whadayagannado.  I'm going to miss people in Newton.  And then Richie's getting back like right after I leave.  As Loren says, they're going to have a "Yay! Richie is back/Alex is gone" party.  As I've said before, I don't know whether I'll be able to send postcards.  If I can, I will.  I come back on July 27.  My birthday is July 31.  So get ready for a big partay when I'm back.  I want to see "Garden State" for that, probably.  See you in a month!

       Just a few days until I leave.  Saturday's the "build-up day," so Friday's my last full day here.  I'm kinda looking forward to it; the experience, anyway.  Not the people, for the most part.  I don't know whether I'll be able to send postcards when I'm there.  If I can, I'll try to do so.  And I won't make the mistake I made in France.  Bill Nye is too a real science guy, not an actor.  And it turns out my dad didn't meet him.  I must have been thinking of something else.

       Last day of school!  Here are my grades:    Math   I failed the final.  F.  But he scaled it to a D+, and I got a B for my year grade.  B isn't bad, even though it stands for it.  But man... if my parents were Chinese they would kill me.  Even so, I'm going to be looking through my mail for a while.     English   A for the final, A- for the term, B+ for the year.  In an asterisk-note on my last (before the final) essay, I had made fun of my teacher, mentioning the quotation "... because now, the cork has been unleashed."  She wrote that she was the master of mixed metaphors.   I hung out with Matt Woolf during C (study), in TV Production.  Just for kicks.    French   Jean Merlet was there for some reason.  I got A- for both the final and the year.  Not bad not bad.     History   A for the portfolio, A for the final-essay, A for the multiple choice, A for the final, A- for fourth term, A- for the year.  Big pimpin'.     Myth   A- for fourth term, B+ for the final project dealie, A for the year.     Chemistry   I didn't even stick around for that.  I already knew.  73 for the final, scaled to an 83.  A for the year.   Afterwards, I went to John's house, where I had lunch and played a bunch of "Super Smash Bros. Melee."  That's where I am now.

       Playing "Super Smash Bros." with Ben Fong is fun.  I did that yesterday.  Also yesterday, I saw "Nosey Parker."  It was good.  Today, I went to "Control Room" with Jonny and Matt.  The walk was entertaining, and the movie was alright notwithstanding the fact that it didn't know when it was over.  I am beginning to anticipate going to Tanzania.  I am against anticipation, though.  So... whatever.  Loren did the best on the quiz, even before he cheated.  It was annoying, however, when he kept rubbing it in afterwards, trying to make himself sound like a truer friend.  Whadayagannado.

       Hey everybody!  Today is the first day I've been able to get into an internet cafe since I arrived in Tanzania.  I'm writing from a place outside my hotel in Moshi.  If you're reading this, knowing I won't be back until the twenty-seventh, then you must  really  be bored since that means you've probably been checking regularly.  So far we've done three "phases": community service, acclimatization, and safari.  It's been alright, but the whole teamwork thing and all the group-related hassle has been amazingly annoying.  In any event...     Community Service   We stayed at a primary school called Kimbushi outside Moshi for several days, helping obtain and work with supplies to rebuild one of the buildings.  We're also going to buy some uniforms.  The kids were nice; they all would crowd around me when I sat down and played soccer and frisbee with me.  I let one of them borrow my watch though, and never saw him again.  Stupid decision, but w/e.     Acclimatization   After hanging out a little with the Maasai and seeing part of this circumcision ceremony (but not the actual circumcision part), we hiked up Longido Mountain, near the Tanzania-Kenya border in the north.  It wasn't that bad, overall, except my damn nose bled a few times.     Safari   We went on safari at Lake Manyara National Park and the Ngorongoro Crater.  It was alright; there were bunches of zebras and giraffes and hippos, etc., and we could stand up in the Jeep where the roof opened up.  Not very comfortable, but moderately interesting.  Not really better than seeing it in an Imax, though.    Tomorrow, we're leaving for Mt. Kilimanjaro.  We're only carrying our daypacks, but I anticipate it'll be a real biotch, especially since I'm not taking any medicine for altitude sickness (I'm allergic to it).  After that, rest and relaxation in Zanzibar.  Then, we're flying out of Dar es Salaam to Munich and then to Boston.  So, this being my eighteenth day (including build-up day), I have exactly two weeks left here, and will be back on July 27, as aforementioned.  After I get back, my birthday will be right then (July 31), so either a movie (e.g., "Garden State") or Rockport or a combination.  I'll see you all when I get back.  I can't wait to return to Newton.  Later.

       Back at an internet cafe, this time in Zanzibar.&nbsp; All of last week (seven days ending two days ago), we climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro.&nbsp; The hikes lasted at least four hours per day, and though I got dirtier than I've ever been, the food that the porters cooked, the satisfaction involved, and the unparalleled sights -- such as a plethora of stars because of the utter lack of pollution and lighting and the view of the cloud cover from above while on the ground -- were more than worth it.&nbsp; Everyone, except for Charlie Mokriski (who got dizzy on summit day and had to stay behind) and Mr. Jobe (who stayed with him), got to both Gilman's Point and Uhuru Peak.&nbsp; Summit day was incredibly difficult.&nbsp; The altitude, which had previously caused only mild headaches, hindered my breathing immensely during the ascent.&nbsp;&nbsp; We awoke at 11 pm after a three-hour nap, hiked for more than twelve straight hours, took another hour-long nap, and hiked for another three hours.&nbsp; At least I'm now able to say that I've climbed the tallest mountain in Africa.  Zanzibar, where we'll spend the last few days, is very touristy, i.e., good for R&R.&nbsp; The beaches are pristine, though I'd rather just hang out and do my own thing.&nbsp; Well, I'll be home in four days.&nbsp; See y'all soon; picture-sharing and birthday fun are coming right up.

       I'm sixteen.  Last night, Loren, John, Steph, and Mel came over and we drove to the Circle to watch "The Manchurian Candidate."  Then we called Jonny (who my father informed us had called me back) and he showed up.  It was a pretty good movie, though not very thrilling and without any revelation at the end, both qualities posessed by "Signs," which makes me want to see "The Village" (also by M. Night Shyamalan).  Afterward, we went to Bertucci's, where my mother showed up unexpectedly and so Loren finally got to ride in the best car ever, the Toyota Matrix.   urlLink     Loren got "My Life," because he knew Bill Clinton was my favorite president.  I've only read the first chapter, but so far it's very readable and interesting.  Time clamed it was a long ramble; I'll see.  I don't know if I should post Tanzania pictures.  There are hundreds of them, so I would have to pick the best five or something.  Hmmm...  Rockport thing next week, maybe Saturday.  Loren, Jonny, and Craig: you're all invited.  If anyone wants to see "The Village" or "Spider-man 2" or "I, Robot" or "The Door in the Floor" otherwise, let me know.

       Man, John Kerry's awesome!  I see what they mean about his being formal, but he still pulled through.  He at least matched John Edwards's speech, if not as good as Bill Clinton's.  Virtually all of what he said was either smart (most of it) or at least correct, if a little vague.  The only thing that I didn't like was this: "I want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation - not the Saudi royal family."  We may rely on Saudi oil too much, but we shouldn't alienate our allies, especially in an unstable region and ones who have begun to crack down on Islamist militants.  Even so, Mr Kerry deserves the presidency, especially considering the alternative.   urlLink     Oh yeah, I've begun following The Economist's style of using titles before last names.  It's more respectful.

       Because of popular demand, I have transcribed my journal from Tanzania, and presented it below.  Enjoy.    Tanzanian Travel Journal: Abridged Version    June 26 : It was build-up day today, at the Charlestown Boys & Girls Club.  The rest of the people have been generally alright.  I’ve managed.  I can tell that the trip will be annoying --- my mother has to bring more stuff tomorrow and my pack is already stuffed to capacity --- but somehow, I’ll get by.  In fact, the only thing (other than that Californian woman) that’s really bothering me is that I can’t quite remember Melody’s address, other than that it’s on Anthony Rd.  For her postcard, I mean.   June 27 : I am in better spirits today.  We left the Boys & Girls Club, “trekked” to the T, and departed from Logan.  Last night’s sleep was nebulous; it represents the primary object of my pessimism for the month.  That, and the group meetings, which waste  much  more time than they ought to.  Otherwise, things are going well.  I wish, though, that one of my friends had come; the others are alright but there’s no one with whom I particularly want to talk.   June 28 : Again, I am writing from a plane.  There’s so much grandeur in flying.  True, airplanes are just as big as they need to be, and most of us have plenty of experience riding in them.  Nevertheless, the sweeping, penetrating sensation of lift, the views of miniaturized civilization below --- in this case, Nairobi, an unstructured yet continuous sea of lights at night --- and the spectacle of the ascent through the clouds, has few peers.  The only thing that compares in terms of stark, yet majestic, impact, for me at least, is that caused by Melody’s beauty.  Which reminds me: every time I travel with groups from North, I always seem to end up sitting next to girls I like.  On the way back from France, it was Madi; on the way back from Orlando, it was Steph (the result of  mutual interest in cards and other parlor games); on the way to Nairobi from Zurich, it was Sarah.  It’s sort of weird that I was made to sit there by Wilson, who wanted Charlie to sit next to him, and what the situation turned out to be.  Even so, I was asleep or lethargic for most of the flight.  Despite the ship’s having sailed, I still feel as if I squandered, or at least failed to capitalize upon, an opportunity.  Well, I have a month, though the only thing I accomplish may be to satisfy my own inconstant desires.   June 29 : We arrived in Dar es Salaam last night, and today we took an eight-hour bus ride to Moshi.  My health has been less than perfect, and Christine has been a real bitch.  Discomfort is proving the scourge of this trip, though.  Not to sound whiny, but sitting in a stuffed, cramped city bus with sixty-pound packs and my limbs contorted to impossible positions in fantastic humidity, is not my cup of tea.  There have been a few rewards, however.  The mountains jutting out of the flat Tanzanian landscape into the clouds provides a natural complement to African culture and poverty.  I’ll have to focus on these things if I’m going to get by.   June 30 : Today was very cool.  In the morning, I hung out with Marisa, Kathryn, and Meng on the hotel balcony.  It was relaxed and fun, and my opinion of all of them improved.  That’s what vacation should be like --- just sitting around, chatting, watching the quiet bustle of an exotic area.  Later, I had an extraordinarily long discussion with Tim, a physicist/med student from Iowa.  He was koolio.  We talked about  everything , from health-care reform to the Pentateuch.  In the afternoon, we took the bus to the Primary School Kimbushi outside Moshi.  The sights were certainly worth seeing.  The strange style of a rural African village resembled nothing I’ve encountered in the past.   July 1 : It was fun again today.  We played with the kids here at Kimbushi for six or seven hours.  Tiring, but interesting.  I played frisbee and soccer --- very intense.  I talked to some kids, and longer to this twenty-one-year-old who wants to become an accountant in Uganda.  I think Wilson knows I like Sarah.  He said that he could picture us together.  Whatever, it doesn’t matter anymore.  And who wouldn’t like her?  She’s such a sweetheart.   July 2 : Today, we did some cement stuff for the school.  Later, we took a tour of the village --- fun.  I rapped.  Wilson got mad when I used the word “nigga” in the Biggie part of “Runnin.’”  Not much else to note, other than that the twenty-one-year-old’s name is Dominic (I taught him to play Bataille Corse), and this kid gave me his address for pen pal business.   July 3 : Another alright day.  We did some work (a lot of heavy lifting).  I’m on budget now, with Charlie.  It’s fun.  I lent my watch to this kid who wanted to keep track of football --- big mistake.  I still haven’t found him, unless that boy lied to me.  It’s weird how little kids crowd around me whenever I want to sit down.  Otherwise, last night (after I wrote in my journal) had that Rockport-at-night excitement.  I saw Mt. Kilimanjaro for the first time; it was very impressive.  Laura and I joked that the two of us could just hang out at the bottom for a week, playing cards.  In the tent, Ben, Josh and I made couplets about are team members.  I promised I’d write them down, so here they are:  	Alex hates our leader Christine. 	He says she’s a bitch, and she’s just plain mean.  	Wilson won’t shut up about the BBC, 	Maybe ’cause he gives it to Mokriski.  	Up in Kimbushi is where we stayed. 	Meng wanted sushi; instead she got laid.  	A thousand shillings is worth a buck. 	Yesterday, Sarah Blanks was able to fuck.  	Josh was mad about his sleeping-bag liner. 	Sarah’s fine, but Melody’s finer.   July 4 : We left Kimbushi, and traveled by Land Rover back to the hotel in Moshi.  Last night, I had an hour-long discussion with the girls “while washing dishes,” during which I revealed who I thought was pretty on the team (Maggi, Julia, and Sarah), and it slipped in that I liked Melody.  I also recited the rhymes from the night before.  The guys were mad at me, but whatever.  Tonight, we went to a barbecue at a country club.  Sarah, Ben, and Mr. Jobe are awesome at ping pong.  After a chili contest, we watched the European Cup (soccer), which was Greece vs. Portugal.  I was rooting for the latter the entire time --- I always root for the red-jerseyed players --- but Greece’s defense was just impenetrable.  I’m also sick, by the way; I have a sore throat.  Plus, I wrote a long letter to Melody today.  Awww.  Off to bed.   July : I saw Tim again in the bar, but we didn’t have much time to talk.  We went by bus to Longido, or maybe this place is called Arusha.  Damn, this pen’s running out of ink.  The campsite here is really African-looking, but it still has fairly definite boundaries.  I hate having boundaries, be they physical or mental, like having to do homework or whatever.  This trip is one big boundary.   July 6 : Now I’m using Charlie’s pen.  It writes too fatly.  In any case, we walked to a Maasai village today.  On the way, I had this big damnable nosebleed.  Sucked.  The Maasai were alright I guess.  The smell was annoying, and there were flies everywhere.  I really miss food.  Hiking up Longido and then Kilimanjaro is going to be such a pain.  I didn’t mind the ionized water before, but now it bothers me.  Bitch bitch bitch.   July 7 : We hiked from the campsite to another one on Longido mountain.  Another damn nosebleed in the beginning.  Christine isn’t actually  that  bad.  The hike lasted several hours.  It was tiring, but I could get through it.  Lunch (cashews and bread with peanut butter) was very satisfying.  I use the verb “to be” way too often in this journal.  Even so, I had serious second thoughts about climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro.  I keep going back-and-forth about it.  True, we’ll go slowly, take lots of breaks, and carry only our daypacks; but the altitude presents an enormous problem.  Supposedly, you run out of breath every ten steps, and it feels like you’re wearing a pack when you’re not.  Man, I want to go home.   July 8 : We climbed Longido.  It was very long and tiring, but it wasn’t really too bad.  Especially since after my daily (fucking) nosebleed, the porters helped me with my stuff.  Wilson got mad at me, but whatever, fuck him.  I wonder if that could be a medical excuse to forego Kilimanjaro.  Again, back-and-forth on that.  Then I went up ahead with one of the guides.  That was nice, but again, that fucker was angry with me.  Christine was distracted, though, by Bailey.  From what I gather, she was hyperventilating and couldn’t feel some of her limbs.  On the truck thing, Christine used the EPIRB (Emergency Positioning Indicator Radio Beacon), and we’re sleeping in these rooms in Longido.  I taught Maggi this meditation thing I do, and later we discussed politics at dinner.  She’s cool.   July 9 : Leader-pen.  We went to the Maasai market in the morning; I got a statue thin of a seated warrior and a small shielf for $37 and $5, respectively.  I think the statue will go in the dining room and the shield I’ll hang from my wall or door.  I’ll probably get a necklace or something in Zanzibar for my mother I’ve gotten pretty good at haggling --- you have to explain how shoddy the item is and how awful their price is at every step.  I did big budget bottom-line and redistribution stuff on the bus; that was satisfying.  A lot of this trip is really nice, especially the scenery.  It’s the hassle that irritates me, evidently.  Tonight my leadership began, and I’m hoping I can prove myself (but I don’t know how much I can do sitting on a Jeep looking at animals).  Two-week mark!   July 10 : We went on safari at the Lake Manyara National Park.  The Jeep group was OK (especially the food part), it was moderately cool to stand up and look out the top, and the wildlife was alright.  The most interesting were these little monkeys we saw at the end.  They use their hands so much as we do, so humanly.  Anyway, I did prove myself --- to be a crappy leader.  I disagreed with most of what people said during the critique, though.  They wanted me to know what was going on but didn’t like when I asked questions; they wanted me to make announcements but didn’t listen when I did.  One thing was said with which I completely agree, however: I didn’t care about leadership.  I don’t care about this team.  That’s not why I decided to do this.  Teamwork sucks.   July 11 : Safari at the Ngorongoro Crater.  Lots of animals --- elephants, zebras, hippopotamuses, wildebeests, etc., but truthfully not more exciting than an Omnimax movie (like the Australia one).  People in the group, especially Maggi, were angry with me at dinner tonight because of my apathy.  Too bad, I’ll enjoy what I want to enjoy and whether I care about teamwork is nobody’s business.  She (Maggie) apologized a few minutes ago, but then I heard her changing her mind to Wilson.  Moving right along, today is the halfway point of the trip!  Below is a list of things I should do when I get back to Newton so I won’t forget:  -cut my hair -watch “Garden State” -go to Rockport -develop film -watch “Spider-man 2” -birthday party (combination) -listen to music -watch TV -eat Bertucci’s pizza -talk to friends (incl. Richie) -play “Super Smash Bros.” -get school supplies -do AP US Ids -study Spanish -eat teriyaki chicken -bathe -call Melody -update blog -get new watch -iBook? (library) -cut nails -watch “Attack of the Clones” and “Gladiator”   July 12 : After an indoor “picnic” at Lake Duluti at which I saw cute cats that reminded me of Hanne, we returned to Moshi.  I had an emotional confrontation with Wilson and them.  I think I’m just sick of being around these people  constantly .  I need some time to myself.  I got a little today when I was reading a magazine in my room.  I think I’ll be able to stick with it for another two weeks.  Never will I buy into the phony World Challenge ideology, though.   July 13 : A fairly relaxed day in Moshi.  I spent a combined total of forty-five minutes at an internet café adjacent to the hotel, e-mailing George and Richie (responding to their e-mails) and updating my blog even though only really pathetic people will read it.  I’m considering asking for an iBook for my birthday (in addition to a replacement watch) so I can do more homework at the library.  Adam Katz, a world traveler staying at the hotel, said it was useful, and his is really light.  Anyway, I thought of things about which to think on Mt. Kilimanjaro: improving the house, social structures of my family, and my own work habits under my upcoming Reign of Terror.  In the evening, the guys pulled a prank on me, pretending I had left the key in the room, the hotel had locked it, and that Ben hurt himself getting in through the window.  I could have figured it out in retrospect (there were a few aspects that didn’t make sense), but it was alright and they said I proved myself in “caring for the team.”  Exactly two more weeks.   July 14 : After some brief uniform/Will Woodstock business, we bussed to the Rongai Gate.  I got a bunch of snacks: enough for eight biscuits, one Snickers, and some Twix Miniatures each day.  I’m still unsure about the climb; my daypack is now much heavier than my big pack, I’m not taking Diamox, and it’s already somewhat cold (although it  is  nighttime).  I’m also very bad at forcing myself to drink water.  So far I’ve drunk as much as 1.5 liters in a day, and we’re supposed to have 4-6.  I’ll just have to wait and see.   July 15 : Day one of seven on Kilimanjaro.  Very easy climb; just three hours.  The only annoying thing was having to bear the weight of my daypack since I have to carry the rope.  Also, I could only drink a little over a liter of water.  I don’t think I really need it that much; so I gather from certain bodily indications.  Snacks are a lot more useful.  I haven’t followed through with my plans for that about which to think; I’ve been too drowsy to think anything but songs (mostly Phil Collins) and snack/water distribution.  I did have one idea, though: I should e-mail my parents in Zanzibar telling them to order a certain watch so I’ll have it when I get back.  Anyway... that’s it.’   July 16 : Day two of seven; three weeks in.  Another fairly easy climb.  I’ve started to have very slight headaches.  It’s unbearably cold at night.  We played a fun personality game.  It was revealed that I see myself as a koala, cute and humble; others see me as a lazy, funny, happy-go-lucky lemur; I would through away the “Styrofoam cup” of marriage; I would deny death as a reality; and I would ignore sex and keep going.  I don’t know how much weight to put on it; it’s just entertainment.   July 17 : Day three of seven; ten days left in the trip.  Yet another easy climb.  Today was supposed to be our “rest day” (you have one every three days), but I don’t see how the hike was any different from the others.  Still no altitude effects other than very, very slight headaches; and I was out of breath a couple of times, but they weren’t too unusual.  The food prepared by the porters is largely the best food I’ve had on this trip.  I’m stockpiling Snickers for the summit day and the day after.  Man, the summit day’s going to be a bitch.   July 18 : Day four of seven.  An easy climb again, except the acclimatization hike was awfully steep.  I’ve successfully hoarded my Snickers such that I’ll have two per day for the next (and last) three days.  Food really helps on hikes.  Gatorade powder also made the water a lot more drinkable; I have to remember to get some of that tomorrow.  Although trekking is tedious, there have been rewards.  The stars, especially those in the Milky Way, are clear, bright, and beautiful.  Better than Rockport.  I anticipated seeing the cloud cover from above, but it amazes me every time I notice it while hiking.  The experience of being able to see it when I’m on the ground is like nothing in my past.  It makes up for all the hassle of this trip, such as just now when Christine lectured me about joining in with the rest of the team.  I held my own.  I didn’t say it (I didn’t want to aggravate the situation), but after twenty-three days of living in poor conditions with fifteen other people and virtually no time to myself, and with a few of them trying to be brutally offensive to me most of the time, I am not going to make an effort with these kids I can’t stand anymore.  And no, I doubt I’ll regret it.   July 20 : Day six of seven; one week left; Jonny’s birthday; thirty-fifth anniversary of the moon landing; summit day!  Two nights ago, I was chosen by popular demand (the alternatives were Meng, Kathryn, and Marisa) to be the summit leader.  After a long, so-so trek to the Kibo Huts and Steph, a Briton with World Challenge who went on the training mission in Connecticut, we had a three-hour “nap,” which served only to tire us yesterday.  We awoke at 11:00, and Charlie had to enter a hyperbaric chamber because of dizziness.  Then, we had a hellish-though-freezing and oxygen-less (my first major damage from altitude) for seven hours in the dead of night.  We went to Gilman’s Point, then did a fairly easy walk to Uhuru Peak, where I lost a mitten.  The summit was not at all satisfying.  Just the fact that I climbed the highest mountain in Africa.   July 21 : Day seven of seven.  Finally, back to civilization after an extremely tedious hike down (around eight hours).  My lips are seriously chapped.  The tops and bottoms are brown and they hurt when I move them.  I hope they’ll heal soon.  At least we’re back in the city, in Moshi.  Tomorrow, we’ll take a nine-hour bus ride to Dar es Salaam, then a two-hour ferry to Stone Town in Zanzibar, then a who-knows-how-long transportation to our hotel, the Shehe Bungalow.  I had better be able to sleep on the bus; wake-up’s at 4:45 AM.  Just a few days of rest and relaxation, then it’s back to Massachusetts.  Oh, and I noticed something on the bus ride to Moshi: we were under the clouds again.  Somewhat constricting, somewhat saddening; but I wouldn’t want to return up there any time soon.   July 22 : A day taken up almost entirely by transportation.  Some of it was, admittedly, interesting, such as when a bird hit the bus windshield and it shattered and fell in.  While we were waiting for the ferry in Dar, I felt strong anger against the team and longing to come back home as soon as possible.  However, now that we’re in a really touristy part of Zanzibar, the last three substantive days might not be so bad.  I wish I could do more of my own thing than what Charlie and Wilson and them plan to do; like visit the internet café, change money, and buy gifts/souvenirs (or as this hotel calls them, souvigneers).  Even so, the Amaan Bungalow is very nice; I think I’ll be able to survive the last little stretch.   July 23 : Today in Zanzibar was fairly relaxing.  Beside meals, we walked on the beach for several hours.  It is picturesque, but not too enjoyable.  It’s times like this, when it’s supposed to be really fun, that I miss my independence the most.  I did get to hang out by myself in a few instances, though, such as a total of an hour at the internet café (I e-mailed my family and updated my blog), and a while of reading The Economist while eating bread and Nutella.  Which reminds me, not only should we start making crêpes at home, we should also make smoothies using yogurt, bananas, orange juice, and ice.  We’re going to Stone Town tomorrow; I hope I’ll be able to find some good gifts.  Otherwise, I think I’ll buy a necklace and perhaps a bracelet from one of the Maasai stands here.  So close...   July 24 : Last night, the assholes bound me to my bed with duct tape; since then I’ve been thrown into the ocean and pulled a prank on in which I was tricked into thinking I had drunk an alcoholic daquiry.  The last one was alright, but the others make going home all the sweeter.  It was actually pretty fun in Stone Town today.  I bought the rest of my gifts.   July 25 : I wrote a rap about the trip; I think it’s pretty good, especially compared to my other stuff.  Today was our last full day in Tanzania.  It was nice.  There was a fairly brief argument about whether the adults should get a cut of the extra money, but that didn’t spoil things too much.  At dinner, Christine delivered a speech about how we were growing and transforming, and gave us polliwogs, along with our Kilimanjaro certificates.  Kerry chose Edwards!  I’m so happy, but that probably happened like three weeks ago.  I miss the news.  Well, I won’t be without it for much longer.   July 26 : This will be my last entry in this journal.  I am writing on the plane home, from Dar es Salaam to Nairobi to Zurich to Boston.  Earlier today, we took a brief flight on a “puddle-jumper” from Zanzibar.  The flights so far, as well as the bus ride and the nine-hour layover in Dar, were calmer and less irritating than I expected.  Back in the cabin, I have the feeling of the return from Orlando of the (semi-)victorious Newton North High School Mock-Trial Team.  It’s as if nothing has changed since May.  On the other hand, this expedition has satisfied me.  Notwithstanding its overwhelming annoyances and deprivations, the trip had a net gain in terms of enjoyableness and exposure in exciting, alien situations.  The most amazing physical and visual experience --- and that about which I have the most opportunity to brag --- was climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro.  Otherwise, the culture and people of this developing country may have served to give me new political, economic, and worldly perspective, or not.  In any case, I did learn a few new principles, and not only a different method of halting bloody noses.  One: a standard for determining my attraction to girls.  I noticed a while ago that whom I like is largely determined by whom I’m near.  In France, for example, I swooned over Madi since she was the only girl I liked and was with on a daily (more or less) basis, even though I still theoretically liked Sarah and hadn’t ruined my chances with her yet.  After that, since I liked Sarah more, I naturally went back to her (the “Fog of War” fiasco), though the Madi situation was left somewhat ambiguously.  Yet, on this trip, when I was with Sarah (whom I still like, though admittedly not as much as before since the ship sailed), there were instances when i was made aware of her cute behavior, but these times, it was different.  For in each instance, I wasn’t simply attracted to Sarah; I noticed Sarah and immediately thought of Melody.  I thought of how Melody, in the same situation, would be cooler and more “voluptuous” (the word she’s fond of using).  In other words, every moment I was attracted to Sarah, I was attracted to Melody more.  The reason for the lack of this Melocentrism during the France trip must lie in my general repression of thoughts about her while she and Loren were (officially) together.  It’s not that I hadn’t “discovered” Melody then; I remember talking to Steph about it before that.  I’m unclear about this because, as a result of the repression, “records from the early days are incomplete.”  So, this could mean two things.  First, that I’m really in love with Melody despite something of an effort to cease it.  Second, alternatively, that I have grown, and this attraction-without-proximity is a sign of my increasing monogamy.  Nevertheless, this is not to say that my relationship with Melody cannot continue as it has been: non-romantic.  Anyway, on to the other lesson.  Two: I have come to understand the true value of my independence.  By far, the most infuriating aspect of this trip was the team, as a team.  I am not, nor have I ever been, a team player.  I am a human being, and I refuse to consider the fifteen other human beings with whom I have lived for the last thirty days as any single, invented entity.  When I am part of a group, I lose some part of myself.  This makes itself evident by the tangible, actual inconveniences I have suffered throughout the month.  When I cannot decide my own path, the path inevitably leads the wrong way.  Forgetting the messages of history, the fundaments of democracy, civil rights, and the free market, I have learned for myself that without determination of self, what’s determined is hell.

       I'm back, finally.  It's good to be home again.  My room is already a mess.  So far I've talked to Jason Sullivan, Melody, and Loren, respectively.  Today I went to get my certificate for climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro, together with three pictures from it, framed.  I also got a haircut; so long Jewfro.  TV is freaky now that we have cable.  Then there's the matter of my birthday stuffs.  According to sources, both Melody and Stephanie are going to come (each assuming the other will come) to the first, local thing, which is somewhat surprising.  Then there's also Loren, John, Richie, and possibly Matt K-K and Craig, not to mention ol' Paul Woolfowitz.  I heard Jason thinks he's invited... hmmm...  Anyway, potential movies include "The Door in the Floor" at the West Newton, "The Hunting of the President" at the Embassy, "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" and "Spider-Man 2" at the Circle, and "I, Robot" and "The Notebook" at the Fresh Pond.  The first two can be walked to, though the former is rated "R."  Let me know which you prefer.  Then there's the Rockport thing, or as Melody refers to it, the "homoerotic weekend."  I can only invite three people because of car stuff; I'm thinking Loren, Richie and John.  Richie... haven't seen him for a while.  So in any case, I hope to talk to the rest of you soon.  I'll put the rap that I wrote on the last day of the trip below (Christine was the World Challenge-employed leader, by the way), with the swears edited out and the words meant to be read fast connected by hyphens:   Tanzania: Props and S***   By Alexander Dietz  This all started a year-and-a-half-ago With thirteen kids, Brazinsky and Jobe. World Challenge had come to our door; We didn't know what we were in for.  They said we should-go-to Africa, see the lions and ducks, But first pay them fifty-two hundred bucks. Fine, I said, I'm in; I admit College may have helped a little bit.   Chorus   [ Christine can go f*** herself. I hope that b**** goes to hell. She stole all our hard-earned Gs. Now she'd better get diseased.  Wilson was the biggest c***. He's done way worse than call-me a runt. Tanzania wasn't bad, But to be home I will be glad. ]   Before I knew-it, I wanted to give-them-a beating. Bake sales, car-washes, and four-hour meetings. It was not exactly my idea of fun, But I wanted to do it, just like everyone.  We had a few training missions, those were alright, Though Bear Mountain was not an incredible sight. On the second one we met our leader Christine. She was a businesswoman, didn't seem too mean.   [Chorus]   We were finally ready to fly away From the Boys & Girls Club, and the U.S.A. In Dar es Salaam, the boys got screwed With the bed situation, but what else is new?  After Moshi, we drove to Kimbushi, Got converted by Emmanuel, and wooed by Dominic. Later we visited the Maasai, And on Mt. Longido, Bailey almost died, But that's alright (alride), she survived. And on safari I sucked as leader big time. It was because I really didn't care Since some-o'-these d***s and h**s are annoying, I swear.   [Chorus]   We climbed Kilimanjaro, that took a week. After so much dirt, I wasn't looking too chic. It was a major challenge, I'll give you that, And at the top, Charlie wasn't doing too phat.  But now we've done it, and come to R&R, Chillin' on the beach in Zanzibar. Was it worth it?  Yeah, I'd say so, Even if our leader has got to go.   [Chorus]

       So, this will be my last Tanzanian post.  I'm writing from an internet cafe (apparently a small room with two computers constitutes an internet cafe in Africa) at Dar es Salaam International Airport.  We have a seven-hour layover here between our flight from Zanzibar and our flight to Zurich (then, obviously, there'll be a flight to Boston).  I'm excited that Kerry chose Edwards, the most electable vice-presidential candidaate, but I feel somewhat behind the times since I only learned such last night and I don't know how long ago it happened.  Edwards complements Kerry well-- he's a Southerner, Kerry's a New Englander; he's charismatic, Kerry's rigid; he has influence in a lot of the swing states, Kerry has power more among registered Democrats than independents.  I'm also happy to be returning home, for evident reasons into which I don't feel like going right now.  I may choose to transcribe my traveling journal here; we'll see about that.  Yesterday I wrote a rap about the trip; I might transcribe that also.  But that's it for now.  Talk to you all tomorrow!

       I can't believe that Steph is such a radical Republican.  She thinks that, instead of trying to find diplomatic solutions, we should bomb everyone that hates us into submission and make everyone else fear us.  Right.  I don't even know where to start, that's just... dumbfoundingly stupid and dangerous.  The thing about terrorism is, you can't kill every last one of them, and the more you bomb countries in the Middle East, the more Middle Easterners hate us and start supporting terrorism.  Many such countries, as Iran, which has hated us intensely since the Carter Administration, have nuclear weapons, so preemptive military action might not be the best first option.  I really hope she isn't representative of her party, or the United States -- and the world -- are in serious trouble.  Melody got me  The Question of God: C. S. Lewis and Sigmund Freud Debate God, Love, Sex, and the Meaning of Life  by Dr. Armand M. Nicholi, Jr.  It's pretty good so far.  That was very thoughtful of her.  It's good that she brought that over, too, because I just finished  Give Me a Break  by John Stossel.  It reminded me of similar books I've read including  The O'Reilly Factor  by Bill O'Reilly, and  In Our Humble Opinion  by Tom and Ray Magliozzi.  Mr. Stossel, the co-anchor of ABC's "20/20," has some very provocative themes, such as the case for limited government since the free market always effects ultimate progress and superiority over bureaucratic programmes.  He also details the problem of media exposure to relatively insignificant threats, argues against the exaggeration of the benefits of organic food and the threats of global warming by environmentalists, and realizes the folly of illicit drug criminalization.  It's a very provocative read.     Yesterday, I went to "I, Robot" with Jonny.  It was a pretty good movie, and it was fun.  I've gotten into Nerds Ropes even though they're trayf because of gelatin.  W/e.  Not much else is going on; I'm too busy procrastinating from doing IDs/Spanish.  Talk to you later.

       On Friday, I saw "Garden State."  It was very good.  Although there were flaws, they were acceptable since this was Zach Braff's first movie, and since its beauty and spectacle decisively outweighed them.  Yesterday, Jonny and I went to Rockport.  That was fun, notwithstanding some vomitrocious occurences.  I wish I could have stayed there longer.  We saw "De-Lovely," which reminded me of how bad movies could get.  It also reinforced my opinion of music from musicals.  I won't get too specific, but let's just say it sucks more suckily than the suckiest suckfest that ever sucked.  Yeah, I know, I've used that phrase too much.  Today (after returning from Rockport), I saw "The Hunting of the President" at the Coolidge Corner Theatre, the only location near me at which it's playing anymore.  I liked it; its points were much less far-out than "Farenheit 9/11" (whose message was nonetheless true), and I think all or the far majority were accurate.  If Steph had gone to it, though, she probably would have exploded à la fembots.  Tomorrow, I hope to start my work.  I also hope to write something.  We'll see how those go.
