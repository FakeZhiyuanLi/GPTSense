      Met Lim this morning, then we went to SPC to get help from Raymond.MATHS..no choice la..cos there's a maths quiz coming up and our lecturer is damn boring. Seriously, yesterday was the very first time I really can listen and pay attention during maths with minimal distraction.  Went to TP in the afternoon with Janice and Mandy..studed in the library till it close..Badminton at 5pm, TP sports hall..I only managed to do little stuff at TP cos I can't study outside..many pple plus distractions..so irritating.  Headed for TM after that..Went NTUC to buy fruits and bars. Then Janice didn't allow me to go home. So accompanied her to YAMAHA..she wanna buy a new guitar. Rich girl.

      Nuts. As usual, Theo and I played with food. Today's creation consisted of USA waffle, ice cream, hershey's choc syrup, QOO Lemon, ice kachang, maple syrup, chilli sauce, butter, tomato ketchup. So interesting. We did something worse after that. Theo poured the solution into Roy's drink can. Crap.   During lesson, we were still crapping. Making fun of HoFM. Theo imitated her la..trying to be funny. TBCM was worse. Only the other half of the class (the rest of the girls) were paying attention and doing their work seriously. The rest of us were gave stupid answers all the time. Theo was drawing throughout. The thing is, we were seated right in front of the teacher's table. First row somemore. hahaha...   After sch, Lim,Wilson,Theo and I went to IKEA. Lim wanted to go there to buy toys, for dunno what reason. We went there for hot dog first. Cheap and nice. Theo and I shared one cos both of us scared fat. Then we played with all the sauce. Custard,chilli and tomato. This time the mixture was nice..so smooth..hahaha...went to walk after that. hee..Then after that Wilson suddenly appeared behind us. But nvm...   Went to TM with Theo and Wilson&nbsp;after that. Kept laughing on the mrt. Theo kept imitaing and making fun of HoFM n GeokEng..wahaha..Wilson went to arcade to play while waiting for his friend. Theo and I went to walk. Then we went NTUC. After that I went home and he went to Orchard.   Tml still can play with food. cos we got one and half hr break. so good!

      Met up with Lim,Wilson,Roy and Theo for breakfast at Mac. I insisted want to go Mac cos wanted to play with food. So disgusting lor..Theo and I played with all the sauce. Mix honey,butter,sugar,coffee-mate,tomato ketchup,chilli sauce,coffee,milo and tartar sauce together. Fun but just gotta bear with the smell on our fingers after that. So fun to play with food. 17 years old already still play..so childish rite? The worst thing is that Theo blow bubble into the disgusting mixture using straw. yucks..eww..  After school, Roy,Lim,Wilson,me,Keith,Nicholas,Addison and Valerie went to Sakae at HarbourFront. Addison's treat.We had buffet. Total cost was $143.80. Too bad Theo didn't want to come along at the last minute, otherwise, we can really play with food.  Lim was perfectly normal today, which is quite unusual. She'd been nuts(to the power of infinity) for the past two days.  Giggles is very alert despite her age. Her lecture was damn boring that Theo and I started to write messages BUT she noticed us. Haiz..but one thing.&nbsp; The teachers din bother to stop us from eating sweets in class.It's against the rule to eat in class..but who cares, rite? Rules are meant to be broken(quote Mandy)..

      Today's lunch was on Addison, Mr Rich man. Went to pizza hut for lunch. The meal totalled up to about $59.++ It's not a problem to him cos he's so rich and $60 is nothing to his father..haha..  Wilson and Jerren ate like gluttons, as usual. Hmm..leftover food..wonder what happened to them? Theo and I played with the leftover food..mixing everything together till it smelled horrid..but was real fun. Jerren took a pic of the disgusting creation, Lim can't be bothered..too disgusted. The state of the leftover food is gonna be worse tml. lolx...crappy plans..depends..see where we go first. Basically, leftover food will NEVER be in good state when tampered with CREATIVE people like me..haha

      Hmm..we didn't do UWOS tutorial 3 for homework cos we din know that it's supposed to be done..nvm..anyway....  Theodore and I brought our neoprints and prom pics today. He's really very FAT when he was in sec sch and also looks very different. Super duper different. Now he so ai mei..wear contacts..haha..but I'm still FAT as I always am. very funny..Lim and I laughed when we saw his pic..  Oh ya! Our NOODLE family was formed today. All thanks to Wilson. He's already so skinny yet he wants to go to slimming centre. Cos of his size, Lim called him noodle.  Then Theo named the rest of us. Jerren:bee hoon, Wilson:mee sua, Theo:mee hoon kuay, Steph Yap:yu mian, Steph Lim:ee mian, Roy:meepok..He named the remaining girls fishball, fishcake, tau gay, tau kua, tau pok and cockel..wahahaha! Our TBCM teacher was called ban mian cos of her hair..Very mean rite? But nvm..  Basically, we're crapping the whole day. See the TBCM teacher already can laugh. But Theo kept making me laugh during DBMS. Observe the teacher's eyes and the way she speaks, then IMITATE! not his fault la..we gotta have eye contact with the teacher when lessons are going on..*Theo imitates the way she pops her eye* (pop_your_eye.enabled = True) haha.. ;p  Lim's damn hyper today. Kept on talking and making noise non-stop, since the time we met in the morning till the end of school..still can't stop. uh oh...something's wrong. She accidentally caused Wilson to drop Jerren's hp on the floor till it was dismantled into a million partitions. But miraculously, the hp din go bonkers!  It's such  a fun day (except for DBMS prac. I lost my Country table..haha..) I'm still very alert now..but the effect of the caffeine from the coffee I had this morning is gonna be 'OFF' soon..getting tired. tml got MATHS..so sianz..of all subjects, MATHS!! ARGH!

      It's Sunday..today is the launch of our Chinese service..quite cool. I was planning to join Chinese congregation but Charissa said I'm mad or something like that. haha..i dun really mind her saying that. cos i agree that my Chinese is terrible.&nbsp; Anyway i'll be attending Chinese service with Si Ning and Janice Lim(if she wakes up early to go church). Today we went to Geylang for lunch, for a change. Tried smelly beancurd..it really stinks and i hate it. yucks! if it was tasty, it wouldn't be named 'smelly beancurd'..lolx..   It's already been three weeks since school started and I guess I'm getting along fine. Except that I dun really like the practicals. so sickening and troublesome. But I'm a student, so i gotta study..School's real FUN! especially having new friends around me and we always crap and do all sorts of funny stuff like the happy tree friends thingy..but it was cool rite? haha..new friends..hmm..pple such as Roy,Theodore,Wilson(very dao),Jarren(pinky),Keith(Scooby Doo),Jeremy,Nicholas..Steph Lim is old fren..hmm..basically this group of us go for lunch together..BUT there's these few of us who're always late for every lesson..me,Lim,Roy,Theo,Wilson,Jarren...cos we're in the same class..hahaha :p   The subjects that we study are quite okie..(except for practicals!) TBCM can be considered the best tutorial..cos the teacher is easy to get along with and we can do all sorts of funny things like locking her outta class and using her account to logon to happy tree friends..wahahaha~the next subject that i like is CRS..cos there's no maths and practical required..our first homework for CRS was to watch Spiderman 2..can u believe it??   I'll stop my crap now..cos I think I'm writing too much and it's only the first entry!

      Today we had bible study after school. Quite boring as had a long day. Everything was boring except DBMS prac. Priscilla asked a question in the bible study material: How do you confess your sin?  I was very sleepy and bored, so an answer came to my mind. And of course, I shared my answer. See ah..to confess sin.  Step 1: Commit a sin. Without a sin, how can you ever confess?? Step 2: Do some reflection about the sin. Step 3: Confess and you shall be forgiven.  Common sense answer right? No sin, how to confess? So must commit a sin in order to confess. haha..nonsense la.  I was very satisfied with my meals today. Didn't eat breakfast. Had one energy bar, two packet of watermelon, one packet of honeydew for lunch. And of course, sweets during lesson time. As usual. For dinner, I had one packet of hello panda, one kiwi and one green apple.  Hope to lose more weight. No pain no loss.

      Such a boring day. Woke up late then didn't go for piano lesson, didn't go for service. Just stayed at home to rot. Practise piano, eat, sleep, study..so boring rite? Actually got morning call..but I was too sleepy. Cos I didn't want to sleep yesterday, even though I was really really tired. Haven't been sleeping enough. But nvm..I got ways to keep myself awake just to sit through boring lectures. Half a can of coffee every morning before class starts will do the trick. So boring. There's school for me tml. so happy. Dun have to stay at home. Can see my friends and play and crap. hahaha..
