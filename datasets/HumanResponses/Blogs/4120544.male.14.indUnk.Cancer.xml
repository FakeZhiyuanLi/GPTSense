      man thats a cool song.  so my day was kinda boring all i really did was watch mtv and vh1 and what what ever was on. the cool show that was on was cribs and it the vma 2004 edition with the ying yang twins which was cool and then i played counter strike for like 3 hours and that was fun and im so good at this game and you should so buy it.  the only thing that i did that was constructive was pick up my room haha. Then my mom got home and then she took me to soccer and it was fun at first and then my back like gave out on me and it was very painfull and i think im not going to be able to play football but i hope it heals before monday.  ok i was walking to the bench to get water i almost fell over cus my back hert so bad and i couldnt walk. the good thing was that i didnt have to do windstrints but the bad thing is that soccer is over soccer is like my passion.  after camp ended me my mom and her friend went to burger cuse she said she would by me some food that made my day. then i got home and did nothing and then im listening to music and talking to the lovelyest person jamie and happy 5 month anniversery.  and i totaly cant wait till tommorw we get to hang if my parents let me.  peace out yall
