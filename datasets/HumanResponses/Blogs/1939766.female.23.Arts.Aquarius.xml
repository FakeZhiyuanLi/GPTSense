      I have to go back to K-Mart today. Not because I want to. I'm getting a bookcase. At least, I hope I'm getting a bookcase. Yesterday they were not on sale, but I was at K-Mart with a build-it-yourself bookcase kit in my hands and was eager to purchase it. However, the circular prices begin today. I don't know whether I want it or whether I even want to go back out there.   I have to do laundry. I'm running out of pants. When I went to see the doctor about my knee, I wore some really baggy pants so I could just roll them up instead of taking them off. So when the tech weighed me, she started the scale at 150 before eventually figuring out that I was just wearing baggy pants. I said I'd never wear those again, but that means I have to do laundry.  What is there to do today that I want to do? Who knows. I feel like I'm eleven, really dreading going back to school tomorrow.

      It's Saturday. I've had two days off and enjoyed them immensely. I guess the holiday helped just to keep me busy -- I have a short attention span and can't quite sit still. Worse, I can't move either. I don't know how I get along.   When Noel Carroll came, I rode the elevator with Lucy to the conference room, and we had to talk to each other. She told me how upset she was that she had to escort him to lunch and set up the reception, because Wednesday and Friday were supposed to be her days off from classes and the Society. Something else she'd had to come in for on that Wednesday. What was I supposed to say to that? That I come to campus every day and take no days off? I don't know what she thinks she is doing if she takes off four days a week. I wish we got along. My favorite is when she looks at me (and sometimes points, this woman must never have been taught manners) whenever she says she's from Georgia, as if reminding me that that's better than being from Tennessee.   It's crazy how alike we are, all in all. I almost went to college at Washington and Lee, where she did, and we were probably within five miles of each other during all of our childhood Thanksgivings.   There's a chance to meet someone else on Monday, and I'm excited and might finally have something worthwhile (non-laughable) to say. Too bad whether I go will likely depend on my mood at 1:30 then, and my mood then will likely be determined by my success and hilarity in a certain unmentionable something.

      I was up all night, and in my half-sleep I started thinking about giving up. Is there a difference between quitting (being a quitter) and just conceding that there are some things I am not cut out to do well?  I like to win, I like to be the best, and I like to seem in control. I also really like cookies with chocolate chips and pecans. I don't like to make decisions for myself, I don't like failing, and I don't like being underappreciated. And I really don't like being laughed at.  I enjoy quilts and crisp sheets. I don't like bath gels that smell like fruit -- I hope I don't get any for Christmas. Mmm, the smell of buttermilk. But not to wear. I don't want to smell like food. I've spent too much time working in restaurants. I hate listening to cars drive on wet streets.  I saw somebody I knew from a while ago walking down the Parkway, but I couldn't remember her name in time to say hello. I actually didn't recognize her until I thought about it later, and I'm glad I didn't say hi to her because I'm pretty sure we were on bad terms when we knew each other. I think.  I've been watching too many television specials about Britney Spears. But they are fascinating, she's a card. Actually they make me feel good about myself. I would like to be a performer, but only for one day. Okay, two or three (weeks?). The world should perhaps be glad I'm talent-less.   Oh, I got something I wanted just by asking, and I didn't even have to explain myself. I can't decide whether this is a good thing, because I'm now afraid that he'll change his mind once he realizes why I expected him to say no. No need to worry about that just yet, I suppose.

      Happy Thanksgiving.  Here's something new to be thankful for: I have ten class sessions left. Too bad five of them are Greek. Somebody's about to get slapped.  I made fantastic biscuits yesterday. Everything was right on track for my first Thanksgiving Jessica-style, even with minimal cooperation from the grocery store. I'm having to retry the cornbread; I must have used too much soda. I had to spit it out. The moral of the story: don't trust recipes if you know how to cook. Who knows, maybe I'll retry the dressing tomorrow. In any case, the biggest difference between my genuine style and the meal I'll serve is that I have no dessert. No pie, no ice cream. Maybe you should feel sorry for my friends I'm having over: no meat, no dessert. What's left? FOOTBALL!  "you can go into the other room and study a little if someone at your Thanksgiving gathering wants to watch football" ... "sorry, I don't mean to perpetuate gender stereotypes, plus there are no good games on this weekend"

      Criminal laws prohibiting rape are justified because "even if the rapist cannot find a consensual substituteâ€¦ it does not follow that he values the rape more than the victim disvalues it."  How can he say this is good enough? Well done, my dear old chap. (Posner)

      I had made another post, but I think it's too offensive so I removed it. It was about the difference between what I'm doing now and what some of my friends are doing now, focusing around the question of why people help others. Seriously, good for anyone who makes a career out of service, no matter what I say about it. So instead, I just decided to write what's on my mind. Anyone who's talked to me for more than five minutes in the past three months knows that what's on my mind is most likely the drama with my Greek professor. So, in attempting to be inoffensive, I present to you some pitiful self-centered whining...  I keep thinking about Greek. I just told my father about the latest issues, and I'm glad my old man thinks the world of me and takes my side without question, but I'm not quite sure he's right. My father says the professor is green, that he has a crush on me, and that my perception of how people treat me is directly related to my hormones. I think about this, especially because my adoration for him, my hatred of him, and my enjoyment of time spent with him comes in waves. But I hate to give my body so much credit.   I'm really upset at the way I've handled everything. Bad decisions I've made in the past are making my present situation worse; when he was always laughing at me, I should have either confronted him privately or refused to stand for it publicly as it was happening. When he asked me about that comment (he thought I said "this is all I can do") I should have corrected him (I did say "this is what I do") and explained why I said it. When he insults me to try to be funny, I should tell him I'll get his point without being put down and will take his advice.   I just can't resolve this because I don't think he's being mean to me on purpose. I don't want to foster any hatred, but I can't let him go on doing this. For my sake and for the sake of others. The last time he made me this mad, I avoided him until I had a breakdown. My grade can't afford that again. Evidently I did something wrong. I was more than ten minutes late to class, and he was waiting on me to begin the quiz while giving some speech about how to be an active learner. This man is really wearing me thin. I need to get some help from him but I really just don't feel like talking to him. Maybe I should write a speech for him and memorize it, and then if I say this one like some little girl at her bat mitzvah he'll know that's just how I talk. (In the context of just having spoken with my father, know that his first advice to me is to be a lady and make sure I'm respectful, polite, smiling, and well-dressed. And self-doubting rather than angry.)  "I keep coming to you with the same concern, and I still feel like it isn't resolved. I must not be presenting myself well. Especially as you've been trying to express methods we should try to learn more, I'm more and more confused. To me, it seems that you're asking for one thing and showing appreciation for another thing. It is clear that you're not seeing whatever it is that you expect.   "I think you'd be surprised at how little I know. I don't say this because I think I don't know enough, but I surely don't know the right things. You find a way to give me an A on everything I do, and don't seem concerned that I skip your quizzes. Then when I tell you I'm behind, you look at my grades and tell me I'm doing well, or that your first profesidiosyncraticly idosyncratic and left you with a lot of catching up to do. And you're telling me not to worry if I don't know the grammatical terms for all the constructions, but then you go ahead and use them frequently. And you don't seem surprised that I can't always tell how a word is functioning in a sentence, and it's like it's no big deal. Then there are grammar questions on the test. You say you don't want us to read from translations in class, but if I try to reconstruct the meaning on the spot you sigh and interrupt me, then say we're not going fast enough. You tell us to stick to the Greek, then you tell us not to use funny-sounding English.   "I'm not sure how much of this is just adjusting to a new professor, or how much of it is you being new, or how much of it is me not knowing how to do this well, but I'm not asking for something that it's impossible for me to know."  Whatever I end up doing will inevitably sound more angry and hateful than I mean for it to. I might go to class today and give him yet another chance, or I might skip because I'm in no mood to bother going to campus and hobbling around for this. I wonder how class will go today, and whether I'll wait until after Thanksgiving for the throwdown.

      I will try to make this exceptionally clear. My liberal arts building has twelve floors and each floor has a different department. I am always on the third floor (Classics) or the seventh floor (Philosophy) except when I swing through the second floor (Art) to look at the power tools and smell the sawdust.  I have a point. Concerning the toilets. On every floor, there are women's toilets and men's toilets. On the floors on which I spend time, all the women's toilets are locked and all the men's toilets are unlocked. This really irritates me. On the Philosophy floor, I have a key and I happen to know how to get the key if I did not have my own (it's hanging in a super-secret spot). However, on the Classics floor I do not know where any key is. Plus, the men's toilets are more convenient to the pod where my class meets, so, for instance, when I puked after the midterm I headed in there.   I've not yet reached my point. In the women's toilets on the philosophy floor, there is a sign: "don't forget to flush! don't forget your key!" Only once before in my life have there been posted reminders to flush, and that was in the HIW in Leuven (the philosophy department there). Does this speak to the minds of women philosophers?

      my un-compliment of yesterday:  "You sound like a little girl at her bat mitzvah who doesn't understand Hebrew."   He's probably a little angry because I keep kicking him. I was just moving my legs around, and then my foot was in his lap. It's happened more than once. I think it's his fault for sitting so close to me, and if ever I scoot away he comes into that empty space. Still, that's no excuse for saying that.  Phil was trying to get on the elevator, and he sees me and holds back. All he says is how am I, and what am I doing. Then he seems surprised that I ask him what he's doing, but I feel like I ought to because he passed up an elevator to talk to me. His ever-knowledgeable advice as to how best to answer someone who asks me if I talk much: "yep." I smile as much as I can through the pain of standing, waiting for an elevator, knowing that riding it will nauseate me, and so Phil decides he has to explain the joke. Poor guy.   Some guy in a bar comes up to me. I let him go on, and finally he's quiet. He says, "you look really young. How old are you?" I tell him I am young and that I'm 23. He told me he's the opposite of me, then told me I was smart for figuring out that he's 32. This is why I like to stay home.   I don't mean to group these three stories together, because I really do like Phil. I just am trying to pull stories from my life and have something to say for myself. I have something to say about that... maybe you've heard this story before. Dave and I always try to keep each other up on who's doing what in the department. So we're walking outside and pass Phil. Dave greets Phil, but I don't see him. So we get out and Dave asks me whether I know Phil, and my immediate response is, "yeah, I don't like him." Since then I've had a complete turnaround, so Mr.-soon-to-be-Dr. Ritter and Mr. Bar Man can wait for theirs. Don't count on it, boys.   I need some girlfriends.

      What would it feel like always to make right decisions? I read somewhere that people who think and plan end up expecting too much and end up disappointed. That is not my problem, believe it or not. I see myself as making rash decisions with no reason whatsoever. So I'm not really deciding, just acting. And acting wrongly.  "She will never agree that a sweeping passion is a ravaging torrent which fatally leads a person to certain acts and is therefore an excuse. She thinks that every person is responsible for her own passion." Sartre.

      Mocha Mirage.  I'm glad it's not my job to name cosmetics. One thing I have been thinking about concerning color is that they exist in the same way mathematic propositions do. Yep, sure do, which I might know more if I knew more about math, but I am certain that colors are eternal objects exemplified in phenomenal beings. Thanks, Whitehead.  Black on Black. I might come up with that one.

      I walked into the Classics pod and there was a leather jacket in my usual seat. I took the one next to it, figuring there was no reason to sit so close to Ritter now that Joe has stopped coming. Some sleazy guy, who works out of a briefcase and thinks he dresses well and probably likes how oily his hair looks, was at the table, and is telling me about how he looked for Locke's treatises in Latin when he noticed he was reading some English translation. When Ritter walked in, this guy being in his usual seat, he had to stand between the jacket and the guy, who continues to convince both of us of his Latin ability as he packs his briefcase. Neither of us being impressed, he leaves the room. I halfway point to the jacket and whisper with disdain, "is this his?"  Ritter calls the kid back in to retrieve his flesh garment, then looks at me and asks everyone's favorite question: "what's wrong, Jessica?" Being unable to keep things to myself that ought to be kept to myself, I reply, "leather makes my stomach turn." He then asks whether it's an aesthetic or ethical judgment. Of course I answer that it's both, and they are the same, and I'm wondering how he so quickly came up with these choices for me. Of course, he's talked to me before, so it's no surprise. My comment quickly shuts him up, which is fantastic, and I think I catch him hiding his feet under his chair, unless that's just his usual shuffling.   Everyone knows someone like this man, and maybe to someone out there I am like him -- never stopping talking and whomever listens is never quite as interested in what the speaker is saying as is the speaker. So silencing him is quite a feat, and I'm rather proud of myself. One further thing to note, which is the principle difference between his incessant rambling and mine: he uses big words. Now, this man makes a habit of repeating whatever I say in bigger words than I've used, which is really strange because it in no way lets him check that we're speaking of the same thing, unless he supposes I understand his vocabulary. But my favorite example, one that silenced me and the one I'll end on, is his telling me, "So you are just perfunctorily seeking a prophylactic pedagogic construction in anticipation of anacoulthons? Impossible!"

      I hope yall like the comment thing and make frequent use of it. Sure was hard enough to put in!  Speaking of yall - I got an email from Phil on Saturday asking a few of us whether we wanted to teach a course in the summer. I actually think this email was not from Phil but instead from someone pretending to be Phil. He started off: "Hi yall" and signed it with his first and last name. And it wasn't from his email address, but it was from one that looked like his name off Temple. And it wasn't addressed to the list, but only to eight students. Why would he have chosen to send it to me? I'll have to ask him about that. I've had a turnaround on the petting issue, too, and I'll take whatever I can get. Okay, maybe not.  Frances and I were talking about this a week or so ago: how is it that there are any philosophy majors if TAs are wholly responsible for the introductory courses? I'm not sure this is a good question based on my experience in class with senior philosophy majors; maybe she's not been paying attention. Anyway, she said that she's in philosophy because of an awesome introductory professor. I really can't say it's the same for me, seeing that my first professor didn't too much care for me and even four years later would only acknowledge my existence when I was talking to her husband, but even so it was the second course in philosophy that brought me around. Perhaps it's different for some other people, and I don't want to say that I can't get people excited about philosophy.  I keep thinking that perhaps I should make some contact with some professor from college, but I don't know which person to contact. I can't say this without it sounding bad, which is exactly why I want to say it: IT IS NOT BAD and if I feel bad, I'm feeling exactly what she wants me to feel. There is a peculiar situation I don't want to deal with concerning that professor who is overly concerned with my conversations with her husband. This really bothers me because I'm sure I'm not imagining it -- there is no way that she would choose to sit next to me with her back to me and talk to three other students while ignoring me even as I tried to enter the conversation, then later would come up behind me and grab my hands when I was talking to her husband. Most students really like this professor, and I think she's a fine teacher but I see no reason for her behaviour toward me. Either she thinks I've done something wrong or she wants me to feel like I have.

      I really love sunny Sundays. I used to take long drives through the forests and farms, but here I'm afraid of getting lost, and I have less confidence in my car. On top of that, I can't drive without serious pain in the old clutch leg. When I told my father what happened, he said, "Oh baby, clutch leg or gas leg?" I could more painlessly drive if it were my gas leg.  LEGS. Basically useful for transportation and elevation. Half of our body length is   leg  ! What's up with that? I don't see anything particularly pleasant about the look of legs, even someone with "great" legs like Betty Grabel. Most of her pin-up photographs are views from the back or are of her with her knees bent. No one has pretty knees, I don't care what you say. Legs may be exaggerated beyond their function for some aesthetic purpose, but you cannot say the same of knees. Purely functional, knees are, and slightly more than a blemish along the length of a leg.    As something that is purely functional, why is that knees so precariously connect some of the longest bones and stronger muscles in our bodies? Must we sacrifice the sturdiness of our stance to the ability to bend, lifting our calves backwards and kicking ourselves in our asses?   "Her skirt is short, below the legs are sturdy." (from the Jonny Lang song) When I first heard this, in better leg health, it sounded a bit derogatory; why would someone with "sturdy" legs wear a short skirt? The opposition continues in a following line: "her clothes are old, but never are they dirty." It's about doing the best you can with what you've got. Well, at the time I had lean legs that earned me compliments. Now I want sturdy legs. If ever I get them back, I'm going to wear short skirts. My grandmother did tell me when I was a teenager that I'd have plenty of time to wear long dresses, so I might as well wear short skirts while I'm young.   Just one more thing to say:  Connie: "Does a snake know he's a snake? No, he slithers around on his belly and thinks he's a king." Cathy: "Connie, you're a philosopher." Connie: "Well, when a woman is my age and not married, she's either got to philosophize or be arrested."  That's from   That Touch of Mink  , probably the funniest film I've seen in a while. I'd seen bits of the beginning and some of the "funny scenes" from advertisements for it, but those didn't touch the best parts. Highly recommended.

      The other night I went out to dinner with Kara. Basically, I found it nice to sit and rest my bum knee. I wasn't hungry, and my sandwich wasn't great. She just sat there and listened to me, and if ever I stopped talking to take a bite of my food we ate in silence. It's not like me to be the one to keep up the conversation. So when she had eaten all of her food, I'd eaten a quarter of my sandwich. If you've never eaten with me, perhaps you should know that I hate food noises, food smells, and chewing. So I was worn out from eating. It happens.  I told her about that class I've been listening to, and that I wasn't trying to make a good impression on her by eating slowly and taking home half my sandwich. This just seems to be an example of two people with different opinions on what it means to eat a civilized meal -- and apparently I'm the one who seems bothered by speed and hunger. Did I mention we were at a Panera in the suburbs? Come on, it's not like I wanted to hang out there.  I've been listening to that old Counting Crows CD that I used to play most of the drive between Memphis and Hanover. I'm trying to decide what to do over Thanksgiving, not going home and all, but honestly I do want to stay here. There's no need for me to seek out some other family for a food-centered holiday, especially with my present attitude. I'd really like to try to cook some stuff for myself -- maybe see how dressing comes out, and make some sweet potatoes and green bean casserole. Round that out with a chick'n pattie and some sort of dessert (Bulldog pie?), sounds good. And the football will be on, and maybe someone will be around who wants to have my kind of holiday. It's a week and a half away, so if I'm not ready to turn in my metaphysics paper by then, surely I cannot go. On top of that, I doubt I can make any kind of long drive with or without those painkillers. I guess I've made my decision!

      Question: How do people with an aesthetic definition of art take art out of its social context? Is a museum good enough? Can the current art ever be taken out of its social context?   If art has no other function than to provide aesthetic experience, how did it persist?  So now, in the midst of high modernism, can we realistically expect anyone to make some good public memorials? Can I ask this question without assuming that there has been any great historical change in art?  I heard Noel Carroll speak yesterday afternoon, in an "advertised lecture" Art, Modernity, and Memorials. Then he expanded past the "advertised" part to make some of his ideas more palatable to the non-aesthetics people in the Society. For the longest time I couldn't figure out what he meant by   advertised   but I figured it out. He meant what was on the fliers and invitations. I really like him.  My meeting with him and the other students in the morning was also fantastic. One of those days that really makes me happy to be where I am. And he was impressed with us -- where else could he go and get a group of eleven students together who all have some passing interest in aesthetics and nine of whom are concentrating in it? It is really good for us to be together and have dialectic and work into our own ideas instead of being stuck with that one philosophy of art person. Too bad this specialization is at the expense of other areas, like ancient... I did tell R. today when he suggested I go someplace else to do it that there was no other good place to do aesthetics.

      I heard a piece of a lecture today from some young professor, probably a TA, and I can't tell what the discipline is. He was talking about sexuality, hunger, and appetite, and also images of women to some extent. In all, he was initially persuasive but missed out on what I find to be a few important points. He asked for class participation to describe some first date that included a meal, saying that there are first-date foods and other foods that are definitie taboos for first-dates. Apparently he meant this to be FOR WOMEN. He said that if he ever took out some woman who rolled up her sleeves and dug in, he'd marry her.   So what if a woman eats dantily on a first date? Is it only because she feels like suppressing her appetite is part of making a good impression? Can't she be nervous, or distracted by conversation? Why does our socializing revolve around food even after we're no longer hunter-gatherers? I wish I were in his class. I wonder how interested he is in this stuff.   Perhaps even my generation is in a different spot than those before us; only in the last thirty years have eating disorders become public. So that girls who ordinarily would not be anorexic, after finding out what it is, make that destructive choice. On top of that, we grow up hungry... I thank God my parents never demanded I clean my plate, but I can't remember the last time I've had a real meal. Probably two weeks ago when my friend drug me to a restaurant, not with drugs, but dragged. Even then I was the only one who failed to finish the entree even as I was the only one who declined the appetizer (I guess they got appetized?). Anyway, I don't know whether it's good or bad to have a man teach these topics, but he seemed to miss a lot of vital information that some girl in the class should have pointed out. Unless I'm some anomaly.

      If that's what it's like to have a best friend (a facilitator to my problems and someone to hold me back) then I'm glad I don't have one. But it wouldn't really be like that -- it's just my interpretation of that relationship.   My plan to become a better person:  - don't be a wimp - smoke less, eat better, don't skip meals - be quieter - try to say the right thing - stop dating losers

      I had a dream last night. I keep thinking about those things people in department have said to me that hurt: 1. James's "I want the body of a 22-year-old"; 2. "you're so pretty, why are you doing philosophy?"; 3. "what could you have to teach me about this?"; 4. Phil's general and persistent condescending affection. The dream invovles most of them.  Most everyone in the department is going to some lecture. I end up sitting around in some lobby, in a beautiful building, with Phil and two women I don't know. One of them is looking at a flier with James' photo on it; I ask them what's up with that. She answers, "That's James, he's been teaching online courses at Temple for like ten years. He posed for this brochure and we'll hear his lecture on his body this afternoon." At which point I decide I don't want to go, but I can't figure another way home except to ride with the people who brought me.   All the sudden, Matt shows up and the five of us take off. Phil is driving and I'm in the back seat passenger side. We're in line to "pay dues" and Phil keeps bumping into cars to make his way through the line. He sees the people in front of us pay $7, so he asks the guy if there is a child's admission. Then he turns to Matt and says they should give a discount for bringing Jessica. He tells the money-taker I'm fifteen. The guy says he'll have to see proof; do I have an ID? Phil says give it to him anyway, and I do... the guy is all like, "You came all the way from Tulpohoken New Jersey?" even though the license says Tennessee. Meanwhile, Phil is driving away without paying. We get out of the car and he gives me a big hug and says, "Thanks, Jessica, I always suspected you'd be good for something."

      Happy birthday Jerry...   I forsee a few problems:   1- I can't be with someone I feel I am superior to, indepent of whether I actually am. 2- I don't think that he loves me for the same reasons I love myself. 3- If I want to be with him, it does no good unless we're in the same town. 4- I can't imagine having to (or wanting to) warn my friends not to laugh at him. 5- I'm afraid he's got too much going on for me, like in As Good As It Gets when the date says, "this is just too much reality for a Saturday night."  I just can't help but think that under different circumstances things could have been so much better for him. Chances are I would not have met him if that had been the case, but does that mean that he is not the same person he could have been if, say, his parents had either loved him or given him up right away?  I've never broken anyone's heart before. He says he just wants to make someone proud. He says he misses me. He says don't give up.

      Rather than prizing beauty as an end in itself, artists saw women turning value (beauty) into profit (respectability, financial support, or children). When women had beauty, they abused it.  Thus, although the definition of beauty had traditionally been formed with a pitifully feminine vocabulary, the new avant-garde found no reason to allow women to take part in beauty.  Women are too frivolous and physical for the aesthetic elevation that beauty can offer, and women are unsuited to inspiring beauty. Many artists eliminated the traditional objects of beauty and aspire to some mistaken concept of the sublime.    First, artists found a requirement of deprivation in beauty and gathered that the perceiver should punish the work.  By making a work of art an object of sustained regard, our active spectatorship is destructive to a beautiful object.  The idea of the monstrous attracted artists like Rauschenberg, and some found that to be monstrous was to prove their true artistic nature and show their disdain for all things bourgeois.  To be monstrous, an objectâ€™s size defeats the end that forms its concept.  The creator is unable to love the created, and the created takes over the creator.  Whereas our sense of the beautiful had previously been based on communication, such as an interchange of sympathy, the relationship between the work of art and the art-lover has been changed.  Worse is the relationship between the art-lover and the work of art exciting a feeling of the sublime.  The work punishes and overwhelms the viewer with mental agitation.  The feeling of the sublime calls upon reason, understanding, and memory as well as imagination.  In its crudest form, this sublime may be characterized as monstrous or ugly.  In attempting to step away from the Greek standard of beauty, avant-garde artists headed straight toward the ugly, missing the path to the sublime.   Art becomes little more than an object as the audience is reduced to a stereotype unable to understand it.  Avant-garde artists have created a counterculture through their manifestoes in which they destroy the common values and pleasures of aesthetic experience.  The aesthetic experience has become separate from everyday events; the feeling of the sublime as these artists understood it was primarily marked by the freedom of thrilling detachment from the ordinary.  Whereas a judgment of beauty requires the subject of the experience to become worthy of the object of beauty, the feeling of the sublime is marked by a non-recognition of oneâ€™s self in the other.

      These past few days have been miserable. I hate having nothing to do. I'm not very good at it. My parents' house is super clean and I've spent all the time I can handle with my grandmother. I took her to Home Depot today to get a lightbulb for a special lamp, and we had to ask for help. She couldn't tell that the stocker who helped us was a woman -- she kept talking about what "he" said. Uh-oh. Luckily we got what she needed and scooted out. Then we went to the grocery and she kept trying to buy foods for me and then saying, "oh, you wouldn't eat that. I forgot." I much prefer talking to her on the phone from Philly. She's good on the phone.  I've been trying to figure out where this year started. Tonight marks a little division, and I can't make it for myself. It seems easy enough that I should remember where I was this time last year, and chances are it's more or less the same place. But then I know I had no idea where I'd be in another year.   Really, one of my earliest 2003 memories is calling up girls with Yong and Kari from Alaina and Marie's room. We were excused from the first rush party to take out some of our girls who elected not to go through formal recruitment. Later, Kari and I bonded over American Idol, but I missed the last five weeks. I called her every Wednesday night from England to get the news. Tobi and I both left Stephanie to spend our last class off campus. I don't wish we'd all been there for the last month, but I do wish we'd talk more since we've split. I'll be in Indy in March, and I'm really looking forward to it.  When I was little, we used to play McDonald's through the two windows in my playhouse. And before the playhouse, we'd have a drive through past the ladder. Over the summer, I finally actually worked in fast food (note that finally) and the only thing that made it tolerable was dating the cleaner. Yes. What was I thinking? Very glad all that's over.  Then I moved to Philly. It's hard to believe I've only been there since August. This is the first time in a while that I've settled into a place long-term. I think I like it, but I always keep leaving at the back of my mind. Not great collateral, but I pull on it plenty. This time last year I couldn't predict where I'd be, or what I'd be doing, but I think it's all worked out perfectly.

      I saw Something's Gotta Give this afternoon and laughed the whole way through. I highly recommend it, but I'd also like to pretend that Keanu Reeves is not in it. He talks funny. He does, thankfully, have but a wee role.  No Lip Venom in the entire city, from what I can tell. I asked at a couple of specialty shops and the guys who helped me said I couldn't find it locally. They both looked at me funny as they showed various other plumpers -- next time, I'll have to stretch my lips thin. The Lip Venom advertises itself as  tested on actors, not on animals . I did get some "sample" (read: experimental) drugs today, but no miracle cure, and painful twisting of the knee followed my compliments concerning its apparent health.

      Now that some holidays are over and various relatives have stormed through and my grandfather is safely back at home and his nutty wife is taking her turn at dying, it's time for me to relax. I watched Newlyweds reruns most of the middle of the day, cleaned up around the house some, and finished Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married. She didn't, by the way.   There are other things I want to do, like figure out where to get some Lip Venom. I also need to spend a Wal-Mart gift certificate. I have no car here, so my little brother kindly offered to take me shopping at 4 a.m. I'm not crazy about that, and I'm not crazy about having to find myself something at Wal-Mart at all. Along with Exxon and Starbucks, it's on my boycott list. I do know they don't sell Lip Venom, so I won't be able to get that. Oh, perhaps I should explain why this is such an immediate problem: it's easy, once I leave here, there's no convenient Wal-Mart near me in Philly.  Tomorrow is the big day, I am finally going to be healed. I hope. Shopping will have to come later.

      From Eric: The majority of women, when attempting to execute an effective insult, will resort to pointing and shrieking incoherent venom before realizing they are too stupid to both stand, point, AND yell.  They fall to the ground, still pointing and shrieking.  Even those with the mental capacity to remain on their feet AND form insults with proper subject-verb agreement (an estimated 16%) usually resort to hurling barbs with all the coherence and nuance of an episode of MTV's Room Raiders (which I haven't seen, really, but I'm SO sure it totally sucks).  Molly and Dana, however, have taken insulting to the next level, for women: not completely inane.  This puts them in the top 1% of women insulters, or the bottom 10% of men.    From the trash novel I'm reading by Marian Keyes: I was all for bluntness. Well, actually, that's a complete lie, I thought it was one of the most overrated things I had ever heard of. But Karen behaved as if being blunt was a great virtue, the kindest act she could do for you. Whereas I felt there were some things that didn't need to be said or shouldn't be said. And that sometimes people used "I'm just being honest" as an opportunity to be malicious. That they opened the nastiness floodgates, were viciously cruel, completely trashed a life and then absolved themselves with an innocent face and a plaintive, "But I was only being honest."

      Thanks, Grandmother, you always pick out the best stuff for me at Christmastime.  Things are crazy here. My father said: "is this what sixty years of marriage is worth? just let him lie on the floor to die." (My other grandmother, his mother, is stupid.) My grandfather is in the hospital and she is worried about her own little cough and her laundry. Reason number three to marry: to take care of each other in old age. Now invalidated.  Do you wonder what the first two reasons are? Good, here they come. 1) to have someone to drag around 2) to split a mortgage.  Reason number thirty billion seven thousand and five: love.

      I'm trying to stop thinking about last Thursday's fight. Really, I can't. At first, all I could think about was the awful things he said to me. Don't get me wrong, they really were out of line. But I wasn't thinking about all the awful things I said to him. Now I am. This means I can't dismiss everything so easily. This means it's not his fault. This means it is my fault.   Here are some examples of things I've done today that have kept me thinking about it. 1) waking up 2) watching the Jessica Simpson episode of Driven 3) talking to my father 4) reading my horoscope 5) toasting a bagel 6) watching Home Alone 7) brushing my hair 8) listening to the radio 9) driving 10) tying my shoes 11) everything reminds me of this.  Basically, anything makes me think of it. Especially things oriented to teenagers. This was such a fifteen-year-old thing I did. And he's ten years older than fifteen, he should be over this by now! I know that in ten more years when he looks back on his first semester teaching, he'll remember this. Hopefully he'll have gotten better.  Other things I think about: everything that happened all semester that brought me to the blow-up point, things that he thought he handled well and I let him believe that. How I really dread seeing the other students from the class in January, how I dread even more meeting the new professor (who shares an office with the man from last term). How I wish he weren't my professor so I could beat him up and keep fighting until I've had enough. (this is what is worst, because every other time I've gotten mad like this I could fight until I wasn't mad any more; I could dismiss my opponent as stupid or shallow or whatever; I would always know that I really might not see him again and not worry so much about running into him; I never have had to give in to an  authority figure ) How I really really want to tell someone in my own department so I can be reassured that I'm not nuts. How I'm really going to have to keep this secret. It's too late for that.

      Wow, I'm finally back in Memphis. Not much has changed, except when I went to what used to be my bedroom, there was nothing there except a bed and a dust buster. No one bothered to come inside the airport to pick me up, and when I was looking around trying to think about what my father would be wearing, I did guess he'd be in shorts. He drove by half an hour after my flight got in and did let his bare legs brave the cold to put my suitcase in the trunk.  Oh! I packed my suitcase fully intending it be heavy. I had some trouble getting around the train, but not too much. When I had it weighed, it was just over 71 pounds. I figured I could stash something else in my backpack, but I had forgotten the weight limit for domestic flights is 50 pounds. So I had to pay extra for that -- oh well, it's just money. Not my money at that.  I visited my grandmother this afternoon, and for the first time in my life she seems disappointed in what I'm doing. She said there's no sign of my mother being a grandmother any time soon. Later, she called me to invite me to her church. She says there's some group of college kids (she doesn't understand I'm not in college, and I guess all in all it's pretty much the same thing right now). They have a couch and drink coffee. She says there's lots of boys and -- direct quote here -- "maybe you could find someone you'd like to be with." Yes, my grandmother said I should find someone to be with.   Oh well, I don't mean to sound pitiful. I guess that's all I do anymore. I'm lucky to be doing what I am and to have a loving family. I know I'm letting a little comment here or there play into my own paranoia. But me knowing this just makes it worse, because now I know that it's not them being disappointed, it's me. God help me.

      If I haven't talked to you about my recent indiscretions, feel very very glad. Exactly twenty-four hours ago, I was in the discussion with him. It's still something I think about every five minutes. There are two things that keep coming up in my own thoughts and in my talks with others.   1) I'm glad I don't actually have problems. What if I were fighting a terminal illness? What if I were pregnant? What if I had physically harmed him, or if he had physically harmed him? All in all, this was a silly fight and hopefully he's dismissed me and what I said to him. When I was leaving, he said I might never have to see him again. Ouch.   2) I really wish there had been an adult in the room when we were talking. Yes, we were both acting pretty childish, and our average age is probably 24. Even so, a person of that age should be an adult, so why do I say we were childish?  And voila, a new topic. This came up a while ago when I mentioned playing to a friend of mine who's only been able to play after reaching adulthood because of his "hard" childhood. Why do we expect children to be playful and not serious, and then upon reaching a certain age become adults and behave in a non-playful manner? How did it happen that this distinction comes with age? Even when adults play, they are playing through their "inner child" or because they are a "child at heart" or else are not "acting their age"...   Okay, so one thing that everyone should do from the age of three: respect others. I didn't do that. I'm not childish, I'm just a bad person.  This is giving me a headache. I'm leaving for Memphis in three hours. I think I'm finally ready to get out of town for a bit.

      Guess why I feel better? 1. Talking to Mike. 2. Talking to my mother. 3. Watching Britney Spears on Style Star.   "I just can't believe I'm Britney Spears. I'm just a human, and I'm Britney Spears." - Britney Spears.  I have a feeling that would be better if I remembered it correctly. Anyway, this show was all about her fashion, which is great because it pretty much leaves out her music. (not that there's anything wrong with her music!) You know who's cute? Her little sister. They look just alike, except when Britney Spears was younger she looked younger. Now, her little sister just looks like a smaller version of Britney; she is younger, but she just looks smaller. What I mean by this is that her hair and makeup were done up. Kara said that she looks pure, but that won't last long.

      It all came out today. Wow. And for some reason, I feel like a really bad person. But when I was talking with my father about it, I decided that I am very glad for everything I said.   So what is it? A final confrontation with my Greek professor. I took the exam and left thinking, "so this is what it feels like to fail a class." This is very much true; I failed the midterm and knew half of the final. For whatever reason, I decided to go back and talk to him. It wasn't until I actually faced him that I thought maybe I should keep my mouth shut. In retrospect, that might have been a good decision, but it's too late for that. I wanted to tell him that my grade doesn't represent everything I've learned. (This should imply that I've learned from him.) He heard me say that I don't care about my grade. This can't be true because I'm ingrained in the academy.   At first, back in September, I'd tell him I was worried I needed to catch up. He'd say that my grades are fine. Then today, after I recited the passage and didn't remember it all, he said he'd give me full credit. As if he's cutting me breaks, as if he feels sorry for me because I'm "busy" (he keeps mistaking my pain, which I haven't told him about, for business), as if grades are important and he's willing to help me out. Well, I told him not to worry about it. I reassured him that he's not going to break me if he's sincere in his evaluation.  He took whatever I said the wrong way, ended up telling me that I have a psychological problem evidenced by the way I handle myself in class, and I ended up telling him that I didn't go to the last day of class because it was impossible for me to have been prepared. He offered to let me do a different passage for the exam. I left very upset and feeling as if I'd done something wrong. I neither cried nor puked on him; frankly, I was far from both. Nevertheless, it's all that I can think about ever since then.

      I finished all my philosophy work for the entire term yesterday. Then, I came home and slept. For a very long time I slept until I woke up hungry, and it is very nice to feel rested even if a bit groggy.   I had some wild dreams, mostly because I was in and out of sleep and because I had so much on my mind. First of all, I imagined that my Greek professor refused to let me take his exam because he found out that I'd not studied. Unfortunately, he made me study. That's my plan for today - study Greek.   Also, I continued to think about Zeami and everything he said about living the artful life. Maybe it's because Asian thought is "hot" right now, or maybe it's because the West has finally agreed that there is some use to embracing mysteries and art, but he's got a lot to say that can cross over to things besides theatre. Understanding isn't always built on knowing concepts that can be logically explained. Sometimes it's better to practice something without understanding while being observant to come to ask the questions that allow a person to develop a feeling for what is right. In the end, what is most important can't be shown but it's evident when it's lacking. If I'm not being clear, sorry... maybe I've reached the plane where I understand but I'm not yet ready to share my enlightenment. Since when did I start calling myself enlightened? Must be something I dreamed.  So much for that, because I'll have to switch modes and be analytical soon enough.   In other news, two and a half days until I fly to Memphis. I think it'll be a good break, and I really need to spend some time with my family. The only problem is leaving on bad terms with Kara; we've hardly spoken in a week. I don't know whether she's stressed or in a bad mood or whether there's something that I've done wrong, but all the sudden the things that used to be fun and okay are no longer fun and are not okay. I want to ask her out to brunch today, so maybe that'll be good, supposing that she wakes up and she wants to go. And that we talk to each other while we're out.

       You scare me when you say things like that   my approach is not even humourous but laughable  So, is it my fault that he laughs at me? or no? Am I threatening? Should I mention that I've been trying to decide for months whether I could take him if it came to blows?  So much for my meeting with Bradley. I still giggle when I say his name. No wonder he thinks it's okay to laugh at me, I always laugh at him. He says some really weird stuff to me, some of it I can't remember. But I think he said something about how he could notice when I'd worked my tail off. Also, he said something about it's been a really horrible semester. I'd agree with that, but I'm not sure that's what he said -- horrible -- that word was all mumbly.  I did get a compliment today that was also kind of weird. Somebody said something to me that revealed how little he previously thought of me.  I really like your comments, and I use a lot of them. You seem so quiet, but really there's something going on in there  (points to head).   So what, am I stupid because I don't talk much?   Finally, I was sitting in the lobby working a bit and enjoying a Dr Pepper for lunch and completely forgot I was "in public." Of course, I'm all burpy from the drink and just let loose. Evidently that was inappropriate, as I gathered by the less-than-approving stares of the guy sitting 20 feet away from me. Most guys think it's cool that I burp, but it's true that it's never good in public. My friend Greg used to invite me up to his room for Cherry Coke and wait on me to burp and get all excited, but whenever I inadvertently do in public he's very embarrassed.

      Three conditions must be present.  First, he must possess himself the requisite talent.  Secondly, he must adore his art and show a total dedication to the path of no.  Thirdly, he must have a teacher capable of showing him the proper way.  If these three conditions cannot be met, the candidate will not be suitable.  A suitable person is one who has the capacity to achieve the highest reaches of his art, to be recognized himself as a teacher.  Zeami,  Kakyo .  Okay, if I'm not talking about drama here but rather if I'm talking about my favorite ancient language, which of the three requirements do I have? I wonder whether my sudden bursts of passion aid my paper writing, because the pages are flowing. This is good news. Things are really falling in place for me, if anyone cares, and I've been exceptionally happy for days on end. Narcotic-free, on top of that.

      I'm trying to decide how much truth to tell. It's hard to know whether being completely forthright will hurt someone's feelings, or even if that is most important (saving feelings).  Oh, and it's snowing. Half my television screen was about Saddam's capture, half about church closings. Weird. After I saw the end of Tony Blair's speech, I turned off the television to chain myself to my computer and write about Zeami, but I do wonder why someone was picking around Saddam's hair and looking inside his mouth. Why was someone doing that, and why was that shown in big screens on either side of Blair?

      I've got something I need to work out. All semester I've been struggling, trying to fit in and make myself un-ignorable while keeping some humility and showing a sincere desire to learn. Where haven't my efforts paid off? In Greek. There, I remain the village idiot who persists in her wrongheaded modes of thinking.  As I've had to shift my focus back to the reason I'm here, I've had to run out of that class early, and apparently I miss out on a lot. Whenever I ask my professor about this or that or whatever, he usually says, "you must not have been here for that..." If I come to class on time and stay focused and don't stop to talk about the Daily Show or how I spilled coffee on my notes, then I should be able to get out of class everything I need. No matter what my situation. And if I have to leave when class ends, then, should there be any important information decided after hours, I should be informed of those decisions.   All of this came together Monday, when I had to leave to meet Zena, then looked for my teacher after her lecture. I caught him perhaps giving me a dose of my own medicine because I had to follow him down the stairs and toward the train station to talk with him. So I emailed him when I got home, asking him to leave for me the photocopied passage that I would need before class Wednesday. I heard back from him Wednesday morning, and so I decided that I would not go to class if he made it impossible for me to be prepared.   I think I've made some bad decisions that will make it difficult for me to get the help I need and to be taken seriously as I feel I should. What's worse is that I need to write him again because I need to talk with him and I do want to go to the reading session on Friday.

      What a day.  Everything was more or less normal up until Phil asked me to be the student who goes out to dinner with the candidate and the professors. At first I was flattered, but really it was stressful and not quite my thing at all. Of course, I thought the first problem would simply be the dinner itself. No. I had to hang around the reception for so long, and it ended up that one other student and I talked with the candidate for a while, as if none of the faculty were interested in continuing the discussion with her.   So then one of the professors drops off me and two faculty members at the restaurant, and the others put me up in the front seat with him. He drilled me on all sorts of things concerning the search, and I just wanted to be sure my opinions were not off the wall. Also, he asked where I live. This was not good because I began to get worried about how I'll get home. I still figure that someone will be going back to campus and I canâ€™t let this ruin my night.  At first, talking with the two professors I'd come with, everything went pretty well. Maybe because I do not have classes with them and everything was laid back. Later, Crowe and Shusterman show up with the candidate. Poor thing. Did I mention that she seemed really nervous at her talk? She spoke on Plato's Statesman and Laws to analyze his criticism of democracy. Kind of odd to give Plato that authority.  We ate, painfully, and discussed things, painfully, and I donâ€™t think anyone had a good time. I hate restaurants.   During dinner Shusterman asked a few times about where I live. I'm really getting nervous now, because I know that getting home is going to be a problem. Weâ€™re in Old City, so even getting to the train station is something, and I didn't want to mention that I've never actually ridden the train and that I don't know where the station in my town is located. After more than two hours of strained conversation, we adjourn, bid the candidate farewell, and four of us pile into a taxi. Because I was getting out first at Market East, that left Sh. to sit in the middle of the backseat. Awkward.   I ask which train to take, get on it without a problem, and reach Elkins Park at 9:00. When I get off the train, I see no one. I see snow, I see houses. I donâ€™t recognize the names of the streets. Really, I find the snow oppressive. It covers up what I know is there; it makes everything look different. I think of Christo and Heidegger. So, I walk. And walk, and walk, and thank god that Iâ€™m so cold I canâ€™t feel my knee and dread the pain I know I'll feel later. I call Kara, hoping she'll answer her phone considering how weâ€™ve been fighting. She is at work.   I wander around â€“ the houses are beautiful, and big. I've never lived around so many rich people before. Finally, I see Ashbourne, a street I recognize. I pick a direction and start walking. I turn around. Eventually I see St. Paul's Church, up a hill. The roads are curvy. There are no sidewalks. I soak my shoes standing in slush whenever cars speed by. I swear I'll never drive that fast down that road again. It's been half an hour and I'm so happy to see something familiar, but Iâ€™m exhausted.   The story is over. I made it back, after an hour of walking. All I can think is that I'm glad it wasnâ€™t my interview.

      Why does celery have so much flavor? I cut some up for lunch and my hands still smell like it. In the bathroom we have a little whale-shaped soap-pump, and that soap smells like tea to me. I'm always thirsty when I smell the soap, but that smell doesn't hang around. I don't end up drinking much tea.  I'm sick of that little cat waking me up at 5:30 every day. I'm exhausted. I got a grown cat about three months ago, and I've never had a cat before. Never particularly cared for cats, either. It was my darling roommate's idea, and now she wants a new cat because this one likes me better than her. Oh, and she told her mother that the cat is mine and only mine. That's not the truth. Anyway, outside our house there is some chopped wood dyed red around the porch. My father used to work in a wood chippery making mulch. I don't think he'd find this stuff quality. So, when we track these wood chips in, the cat likes to attach them and try to eat them. She always pounces on them, chews for a bit, then spits them out and starts over. I think she deserves to get a splinter in her gum.  Oh, Jessie called me last night to tell me about Adam. He's a millionaire! This was news to both of us, but when I went out to tell Kara (mind you, I had to put on clothes to do this...) she already knew. She didn't think she needed to tell me, and dismissed what I had to say even as I was trying to be friendly. God, if it doesn't involve abused animals or Harry Potter I better not mention it to her. Anyway, I am really looking forward to tomorrow night and just hope we don't fight any more.

      Yesterday I met another candidate for the ancient position. I did like everything he had to say, so much that I had trouble coming up with a question to ask (we were supposed to shut out the faculty, which of course didn't happen). I saw everyone's reaction to him, and because I'm not a Vlastos fan I didn't know how to grill him on his method of Platonic Interpretation.   I guess he's used to people disagreeing with him, and he probably feels like some sort of crusader, and let the hard questions slide right off, usually by saying that these questions don't address his issues. Poor Vision, he asked something that applied to the "historical Socrates" and this man's reaction was to put on a look of shock and say that he said nothing about the historical Socrates. Which is true -- he made that clear from the beginning, but he should have understood Vision's confusion.   When he began his lecture, he apologized for reading his paper (which is expected!). He wasn't wearing a jacket or tie, and so it was kind of funny when he was introduced and we were told that we are able to loosen our ties or take off our jackets because the room was so warm... it was almost like a punch at him.  Really, I liked what he had to say. I wish he weren't so full of himself. I rode the elevator with one of the professors who asked me about him, but it was punch-punch-punch questions. His final question was "is he too low-key?" He is low-key, and the department could use some of that, but he's not unprofessional or lax. I hope they don't hold this against him.  I hope they announce the decision to the students once it's made. Their choice will make a difference in where I am in the near future, and I might be happy enough if this is my last and only snowy winter. (Unless I get a cabin in the woods in Montana or Canada with a fireplace.)

      I rode alone in the express elevator with some kid talking about snow, and he said he wanted to make a dirty joke but it must not have been very good. I hate it when people act like people who are bothered by the weather are silly, as said some other annoying girl. I wish I had a fireplace and could just sit by it and talk through my paper without writing it.  ...to reside in thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice ... or to be imprisoned in the viewless winds, blown with restess violence round about the pendant world...

      My grandmother-in-law, I guess she's about 90 years old, she does Tea Ceremony. Of course, she consumes more beer and cigarettes than tea. She's just an artistic, refined, Japanese woman.  Is that you or me that smells like cigarettes? Or do you smell my grandfather? Do you have grandchildren?  The greatest pleasure I know is to do a good action by stealth, and to have it found out by accident. For Teaism is the art of concealing beauty that you may discover it, of suggesting what you dare not reveal. It is the noble secret of laughing at yourself, calmly yet thoroughly, and is thus humour itself, -- the smile of philosophy. (Kakuzo Okakura)  :Are you having a busy time of the semester? : No.  :Really? : Okay, yes. (?! - this is not the truth, but perhaps what he wants to hear)    On Monday I had a meeting at 1:30, I was able to meet some candidates I really wanted to talk to. I'm sorry I had to run out, is this your concern?   :No, I just couldn't seem to find your composition...  be direct already!

      I think it's fantastic to meet people who know some of the same people I've encountered thus far in my academic career. One of my professors this term actually did his dissertation with the man in Leuven who almost made me give up philosophy.     One of these days I'm going to have to tell Paul about my exam with this man. He'd get a good chuckle from it. As long as he understands that I'm telling it as a joke.   I think this is a sign: I like my classes when my classes don't include Greek. I like my professors when they treat me like I know something. I like talking with professors when I'm not worried about hurting their feelings (what a weird concern!). And I like pretending to know something about stuff more interesting than grammar.  "Do you know any lawyers?" No, I don't think I do.  ... "lawyers tell good stories." So do truckers. I mostly know truckers. ... "how do you know truckers?"

      They're turning off my electricity again today. And tomorrow.   Yesterday I met the first of four candidates for the Ancient position. He was not very impressive, and his lecture was like a scavenger hunt for interpreters to back up his thoughts on Aristotle's middle books from the Metaphysics. He didn't really say much of weight, and my reaction to hearing that was, "does he want a job?"  Completely unrelated to his work is his hair. I guess it's my age and my moving into hanging out with a new age group. He's 12 years older than I am and balding. Not bald, which is no problem at all, but balding... as in, he's got some hair but a lot more scalp showing through it. I think what made him extra-funny looking is that his hairline isn't receding; he has a definite hairline across his forehead, it's just what's directly on top that's lacking. Hmm.   The best part, Josh and I agreed, was when he got really angry trying to defend himself against Professor Vision. I think I could have done better than he did. Vision was upset because of this guy's reference to something being complete (Vision saying he doesn't understand either complete or absolute), but no one bothered to mention how important  complete  is in Aristotle. This guy's lecture was on Aristotle.   The second best part was when Professor Shusterman declared the session over, then proceeded to ask one last question: "how would you respond to the form of the formless?" Of course, this makes not a lot of sense if you don't know where Shusterman is coming from. The poor guy tries to make some response, then asks him what he means. Which opens up for the floor for Sh. to talk on and on about Zen in Aristotle. Whatever.   I hate Average Joe. I hate it so much I can't stop watching it.

      This needs a bit of introduction: the third-semester students just got their history prelim results, and everyone is angry. I don't know all of them, and I don't know anyone who passed (I've heard from three who've failed). They get one more chance to take the test, and if they fail again they're out. Why is this a big deal? This year the format was changed, and apparently no one knew how to take it, and the professors didn't know what questions would be best to ask and they didn't know how best to grade it.  So, I'm re-thinking my career goals, because I just might fail out of school. Did I hear you say, "it's about time?" Maybe this is all for the best.   Some of the people who failed blamed things I don't buy into (one guy complains because history of philosophy isn't strong at Temple -- that doesn't mean we shouldn't know it; another complains that they expected him to regurgitate Plato's arguments and not show off his analytical abilities -- well, yeah, this is to prove you understand the historical philosophers... etc). That aside, there are more "strong views" that frighten me:  Word, listen to Bassam: ======================== Of course, students may still try to console themselves by studying the bootlegged copy of past exam questions, but in the end, it may be of no use in attempting to meet convoluted, arbitrary, and unattainable standards.  It has now become clear to me that when it comes to the prelims, the department is running a shady operation. When some of your top students (e.g., straight A's students or those with MAs in philosophy, hence, with a rather adequate preparation and background in the subject) don't make the cut, it reveals some apparent defects in the test process itself, rather than a defect with our students, which some of our faculty is laboriously trying to make us believe.  For example, on more than one occasion, I was denied the opportunity to review my original answers "on conditions of anonymity," (even though they were my own answers) and because the department was unsure if they kept records of students' responses in the first place, and later, I was told the department couldn't release the only copy they had, not sure which of the above excuses is really true, but this is a laughable notion indeed. I requested to review my original answers because after I met with the graders, I realized that we were getting nowhere trying to remember the essays without having them in front of us, for without the essay answer in hand, it does no good to send a student to meet with graders to discuss the exam.    In my case, I went as far as retracing my sources and referencing exact passages (where arguments and examples appear in primary texts) that I used on an essay which a certain grader had initially found problematic. Upon sharing my primary citations with the grader to disprove his comments, the best answer he could give was that he is "unmoved by an appeal to authority." Well then, I guess some of our faculty must have understood the great philosophers better than the great philosophers understood themselves.   Although there is much left to be said, I will stop here, for my philosophical phallus is not as big as some of our graders. Like Don, I have no reservations about coming out of the failed prelim closet, for doing so empowers us all and invites others to shed their undue humiliation. If I am right, future students will no doubt be dragged into the fray; but all students must feel free to voice their concerns and not give in to ad fortiori tactics, intimidation, or power politics of any kind. Let them not forget that we are the reason they have their posts.

      1. My grandparents sent a birthday check. I am thankful, especially for the attached note warning that I will no longer receive birthday money, only anniversary money. Yes.  2. Kara gave me a card with the message, "we're friends because, amazingly, you don't seem intimidated by my beauty." She later told me that her co-workers thought she was calling me ugly. These co-workers  have  seen me; however, Kara insists that they don't pay attention to how I look and are making no judgments about me.  3. I heard from several friends (some very very unexpected) and got a basket of cookies. I love it when the day is all about me! And, of course, someone else having a surprise party tonight not even on his birthday. I do know how to share!  4. I'm so happy, and I'm so lazy. I must be old.

      I went to the bank today to deposit a check I made out to myself. I realized while I was at the ATM that I did not endorse it, but had no pen on me to sign it there. This ATM is on the street, so there were no pens around. I deposited it anyway. It did show up on the online account summary, so if I get some cash tomorrow, I won't be overdrawn, right? I can't believe I thought I would work in a bank. I'm not cut out for this stuff.  Oh yeah, I was watching Oprah's 50th birthday party this afternoon and got all scared because I realized I'll be 50 in thirteen years. Not so quick with the numbers, I am.

      I filled out some job applications this morning. I'm really setting my sights on a job that I can get rather than a job I want, so with lowered standards I will leave the companies unnamed. I am holding to my standards of working in place that does not require me to wear a hat.  Here's my point: one electronic application was really weird: after asking for the basics, there were 70 true/false questions that sounded like a personality test. Most of the questions were stuff like, "Sometimes it okay to steal something small." "Everyone has shoplifted in their adult life." Evidently not stealing is very important! Also, there were twenty or so questions that were multiple choice to describe myself and my work habits. This part I worry about if they are looking for contradictions (I checked logical and creative; rule-follower and self-starter; etc.). So many questions! Hopefully I'll get a call; it worries me when there's no personal interaction to apply. Not like that has worked for me so far!  Television update: I'm suffering through the American Idol tryouts, just waiting for the final contestants to battle it out. I also suffered through Average Joe. I say suffered because I'm less interested in the guys fighting than seeing the losers interact with the girl. I need to catch last week's Newlyweds. Actually, there was one television-related question in the true/false section, probably to catch the people who don't change the preset answer from true to false: "I have never watched television or used a telephone." Without changing the answer, the company would see "True" as a person's response. Tricky!

      How did this happen? Yesterday I went to the mall. At the first store I visited, I wondered why all these sweaters have hoods. I thought to myself that I wouldn't want to wear a hooded sweater. Then, at the second store, I choose between a hooded oatmeal sweater and a non-hooded red sweater. I wanted to find a hooded red sweater in my size but there wasn't one. I buy the hooded oatmeal sweater, and it wasn't until I was drifting off to sleep that I remember my initial disdain of hooded sweaters. Where do I put the hood when I put on my coat? Should I return it? Save it for spring?

      I went back to school today and am feeling much better, even in light of the new regulations and the return to Greek. Every once in a while I get the idea that someone knows (when the new professor says he's heard about me??) but I think I'm just paranoid. But I'm not sure, and I am driving myself crazy being careful.  I have an interview Monday, but I don't think I'm going to go. I really need something close to home and this place is pretty far away. Hopefully I'll get some more opportunities soon. Maybe I will end up working at a grocery store... at least if that's my job, I won't have to wear a hat and won't soak up funny smells. I'm still trying to decide whether I need a little money at a high price.   Finally, I think Morgan (the kid who lives above me) got a stereo and exercise ball for Christmas. She sure does make a lot of noise.

      Today is the day I make an appearance on campus. Yesterday I applied for about five jobs, bought some junk at Ikea, and that pretty much filled my day. Here's the deal: I don't mind starting classes up again, but I really don't know what I want to take, and my best option is to take greek and one philosophy course.   That being declared best, I don't want to do it. I don't want to see those students again, I don't want to chance running into the old teacher in the hall... which would be a little easier to guarantee if I knew where my new classroom is, but I don't. So, I'll just have to brave it out and see.    Permanent signage is being installed at the main entrances of campus buildings.  Because of this growing body of evidence, and the concerns expressed by an increasing number of students, faculty and staff members who are regularly and unwillingly exposed to second-hand smoke, a thorough evaluation of the existing smoking policy was conducted in light of health and safety considerations. Consistent with these concerns, the University has amended its smoking policy to prohibit smoking within 25 feet of the main entrances of University buildings.    Signage?

      Yesterday was all about teeth. I made a return trip to my dentist to get a couple of cavities filled and two trips to a denture clinic to help my grandmother with a repair to her broken false teeth. Her advice to me is always the same, and she reminds me of it nearly every time I see her: Don't ever get old.   I wonder whether the money, pain, and metal mouth I was spared by never having braces is coming back on me for having bad teeth now. (Yes, I brush frequently, I have an extensive whole mouth care ritual.) If it is karma, how will it be when I'm old? If I get old. I vow right here to spend the money required to get properly fitting teeth.  About that pain -- yes, there is pain. There should be no pain, but my dentist hit something wrong with the injection, and pain shot straight up from my gum, through my cheek, and into my eye. I thought I was going to be blind. The left side of my face swelled up, and though I am confident I will recover (I'm dramatic, not hypochondriatic), my jaw aches. Enough.

      I think it's time for a change. Being in Memphis has really woken me up to how silly my life is. For the first time in a long time, I've been around people who are not students, and I think I like it. So no matter what I end up doing, I want to expand my associations. I've known for a while that I'm going to need to get a job this term, and I'm trying to decide what I'm going to let dictate my availability. Things are still in the works, and I have options. I love having options. It's just like starting over, and there's nothing I like better than starting over!

      Yesterday I spent some time with my little brother, probably the most time we've spent together in five or six years (or more). Man, did we have fun. First he came over and we went to the police station to pay his traffic violations fines. We parked in a spot marked for "traffic violations customers." Then we went to his apartment so I could meet his roommate's dog, Tank. Tank loved me, poor dog.   He asked me if I had any lotion, then starts scratching his leg (the boy, not the dog). He pulls up his pants leg to show me his newest tattoo, which is his initials above his ankle done up in three shades of black. Not even his real initials... kind of girly, I think. He needs some designs on his shoulders.  I took him out to lunch at Blue Plate, where he got all nervous every time I looked at him. Something was funny about one of the waitresses with a baby. Apparently he thought she'd stay pregnant forever. So, he'll have to call Emily to tell her the waitress had a baby. And butter, lots of butter. Growing boys need to eat.  We went to the bookstore to buy his books, then he brought me home and he took a nap. He said he'd come back for me after class because his friends wanted to meet me because I'm "tripped out." He insists this is not a bad thing. I told him I'd only go over to his place if we could watch Average Joe. So we go over there and he and one roommate talk about how great it is that Ross doesn't hate me. Who is Ross? Apparently Tank is Ross. Poor dog.   Then they play cards and I read a magazine, they run off somewhere and I watch television, then finally I get my brother to take me home. Wahoo.

      I've been watching  That's My Baby  on Animal Planet, and I really liked a couple of episodes I saw about rhinos. Each episode documents an animal giving birth, everything from dogs and cats to alpacas and elephants and hippos and rhinos. Those are the ones I've seen lately -- I'd love to catch a monkey birth. So far my favorite is the rhino.   I just finished  Girl with a Pearl Earring , about a maid in Vermeer's house who ends up being the subject of a very famous painting of his. I do wonder how much of the story is invented by the author (probably a lot) and some of the side stories were a bit irritating, especially the three sentence alley scenes. Hmm.

      I didn't really make any resolutions, and I don't think I've broken any that I would have reasonably made. But today seems to be the day for breaking them. So much excitement, if verboden debauchery is excitement. No, not at all: rather, life is back to normal. Except now we feel bad about it.  I hope I never have an entire  other  family to hate me. My parents really don't like my brother's ex-girlfriend, and for some reason she had planned to come over to sell cookware to my mom. She canceled even before she got word that my mother was going to be really tough on her. I'm glad not to have to witness that. And my father calls her a hussy. I wonder what she's ever done wrong... all I know is that she makes my brother very very angry (he punched holes in the wall).  I'm on the other end of things with Kara. She is still attached to some loser and his entire family. His family is very close, and she still talks to his cousins and wants to stay friends with his brothers. The last time she and her ex hung out, they brawled and she broke his necklace (this was down the street from where we live, way down the street). I wonder why she would ever date a man who wears a necklace, but apparently it's some family thing and they all have one, each with a different charm. Yuck. So she has to buy him a new one because his parents are furious.   I really don't think anybody hates me, but in my couple of examples it is the girl who is hated. Not so bright.

      I like to play backgammon, but only if my opponent promises (move by move) to let me win.  I can be happy for a football win without saying the winning team tried three times to lose.  I can watch Girls Behaving Badly with my father, although I'd rather not.  My brother's ex-girlfriend is coming over Monday to try to sell cookware to my mother.   My uncle's ex-girlfriend, from 1967, was my grandmother's enabler when her husband was in the hospital.  I have yet to buy Kara a birthday gift, send her a card, or get up the nerve to call her. I am pretty sure she'll have everything she wants without me in the way.

      Sundays always feel so much better than Saturdays. No matter how un-busy my week has been, Saturday is always a day to relax -- or to get out there and deal with the public. Even though I have two days off during the middle of the week, I'd always rather shop on Saturday. (Grocery shopping excluded -- that's a late-night activity unless I need a top selection of baked goods, etc)  But Sunday I like to stay around the house and let me mind be ON. Things always come together on Sunday.  I've been struggling with a paper for a few days, mostly just astonished at how I pretended that I didn't have to do it, then blocked at what to do, etc, so I just wrote, just some superficial summary of the work. This morning, my thoughts came together and I know what I'm writing about. Now I just have to finish it.

      Last night I noticed that Kara's floss looked like mine, and I popped it open to check the smell. Yep, pickles! Hers is from CVS.  Also, I've noticed once or twice some guy smelling like my uncle. Usually on the bus, last week in my phil class. Always a man. I can't figure out what it is -- to me, it's a stink; perhaps that's a reflection of my feelings toward my uncle. Do they want to smell like this? Is it cologne or deodorant of a particular scent? Is it bad breath? Is it farts? Seriously, I can't tell whether it's a stink or a fragrance. Maybe I will never know, unless I ask the perpetrator what that smell is.

      Even though today has every marker of being awful, it really pulled through. I just have to work very hard for a few more days, then I can coast for a while...  After skipping two days of any semblance of schoolwork, I wrote a paper and translated 100 lines yesterday. If you don't have a feel for what it's like for someone at my level to translate, 100 lines is a  lot  (a week's worth, in fact, and it's impressive to do it in one day). So I went to class more or less confident, and that confidence shook when the teacher said, "yeah, Wednesday we got through a lot!" I heard him say, "without Jessica, we had a really successful class!" Don't worry, by the end of the story, it'll be fine. Things get worse, because I had thought I'd done really well working ahead and would be prepared no matter what the assignment turned out to be, but his assignment had skipped around. So I was incredibly nervous waiting my turn, and with only three of us in class, everyone always has a turn to translate. Well, perhaps he glanced at me and saw me hyperventilating, but something happened and only the other two translated. After the first woman did about 7 lines, the other woman did the rest of the paragraph -- more than her fair share -- and we ran out of class time. Yes! This teacher is a really good guy. Not too easy, but a stand-up human being. He can tell when he's freaked me out, and he's willing to work with me, not against me.  What else made this day great? I can't even remember. The rest of my afternoon was pretty weird; I spent 15 minutes in line at the ATM on campus. There are plenty of ATMs, even on in the library, but only one accepts deposits. Perhaps it was bad timing to want to make a deposit on the last Friday of the month. Really strange, and it would have been fine except the one girl in front of me was having some problems and took 4x the time she should have.  Then I went to my friend Phil's WIP. "Anxiety and Epistemology: The Role of Outlaw Emotion in Democracy." It was really cool -- he followed arguments that oppressed groups in society tend to think more rationally as a result of their anxiety (ability be in the moment and see things as they are). Based on his title, I had no idea how he was going to bring those four big topics together, but I really enjoyed it.  I went to two grocery stores to do some big shopping. I ended up buying a ton of sweets: three kinds of cookies, ice cream, pop tarts. Also, a ton of breakfast stuff: a box of dry cereal, oatmeal, cream of wheat, and 5 grain rolled hot cereal. I was hungry for oatmeal earlier, and I got home without realizing I bought two kinds of it. I did get some regular food, too.

      I can really appreciate a day at home after being gone all day for the past three.   What have I been doing all morning? Writing a paper explaining why Socrates might have thought that it is impossible for a person to have a false belief. Imagine being seven years old: someone asks you what you want to do when you grow up, and you say, "I'd like to explain silly paradoxes from three thousand years ago." No, I never said that.  You may ask yourself, did that take all morning? Why, no, it did not. I have taken time to read some of the Iliad, do the dishes, and watch two sitcoms. Things are going better than anticipated.

      Yeah, so I just now emailed my teacher for tomorrow. I checked my email again and was very excited to find a new message, and I hoped it would be from Melissa. One of my friends who says she likes to write, then never does, but I love her too much to hold it against her.   Anyway, the new message wasn't from her -- it was from Pantene. I was still really excited!   Sidenote -- as many !!! as I've been putting on here and as cheery as I've been lately, how did I manage to sound so pathetic in my email to Alex, my teacher? What's up with that? Where's the takeback? The unsend? The days when no one cared whether I came to class?

Now, for the fun of telling my teacher I'm skipping his class to practice second-level produce identification! (I'll leave out the reason, it's none of his business, I just don't want him waiting for ten minutes for me to show, which I know he would)

      I had my presentation this afternoon over Plato, and whether it went well is still to be decided, but it was great that I decided to go first. That's half my grade I'm already done with, and just one less thing to worry about.   The next thing I have to worry about is getting a shower tomorrow morning. I'll leave the house 10 mins after Kara, and we've never had to get ready at the same time before. Plus, I don't know whether she'll even wake up to go to class -- right now she's asleep with a cold. This is so much a lighter worry than a presentation over confusing stuff I don't understand!  Can you tell I'm working on being happy?

I guess there is more news I should count as good. I was in a pissy mood, so I went to Blockbuster to get a copy of Legally Blonde. I need to watch it for guidance on being happy and supportive when everyone underestimates you and thinks you're in above your head. I found a copy and brought it home. Turns out Legally Blonde 2 was in the Legally Blonde case. So I watched it and will return it tomorrow. It's like a free rental. It was fine to watch, but I don't want to keep it -- I wanted the first one; I'm not paying for a copy of the second!

      4. Re-opens cases about confusion and being wrong, none of which allow false belief:  a) two somethings known cannot be confused with each other if neither is being perceived b) something known cannot be confused with that which is unknown c) two unknowns cannot be confused with each other d) that which is unknown cannot be confused with something known e) two things being perceived cannot be confused with each other f) something being perceived cannot be confused with something not being perceived g) two things not being perceived cannot be confused with each other h) something not being perceived cannot be confused with something being perceived i) something known and being perceived (with a memory mark matched to perception) cannot be confused with another something known and being perceived j) something known and being perceived cannot be confused with something known k) something known and being perceived cannot be confused with something being perceived l) what is not known and not being perceived cannot be confused with something else that is not known and not being perceived m) something not known and not being perceived cannot be confused with something that is not known n) something that is not known and not being perceived cannot be confused with something not being perceived  5. Some cases in which false belief may arise:  o) something known may be confused with something which is known and being perceived p) something known can be confused with something which is not known, but which is being perceived q) something known and being perceived can be confused with something else known and being perceived  Plato's Wax Block proof, from the Theaetetus. Following this, Theaetetus says, "Now I'm even more confused than before." But which way is he confused? I'm quitting for tonight.

      It's started again. I have class one hour each Wednesday. Ideally, I should arrive on campus at 12:25 and leave at 1:40. If class ends on time, this is easy. But no... we start late, and today was exceptionally bad. This one girl in class tells the prof about how she's less than prepared, how she's had to wake up early to take her cat to the vet, go to work, etc... I don't care. I don't care. So what was late becomes later. Then, of course, we run over. Usually I can get to my bus if I leave the room at 1:36 at the latest. So I scat out of the room while the others remain asking questions about our upcoming quiz (as if they've never had a quiz before). I see the bus pulling away, but I'm too far from it.   Besides the fact that it's my classmates making me miss my bus, I am upset because I don't have lunch. Usually, I eat when I get home. Of course there's plenty of food on campus, but I don't want to pay for anything if I've got too much food at home. I'll have to start throwing stuff out soon, I can't eat it all fast enough. So I suffered through an hour at the library, no time wasted, and got a seat early on the following bus. Then I came home and stuffed myself with bagel and red pepper. Way better than anything I could get on campus, that grease-pit it is.

But every once in a while, it's nice, kind of like going to the ocean. Even if you live close to the Gulf Of Mexico, it's worthwhile to take a few extra hours to get to the Atlantic Ocean, so it can slam you into the sand as if to say, "I'm an ocean, don't mess with me."  Then I bought half price V-Day candy!

      Today has been really strange so far. I'm gearing up for my orientation tonight, bleh, and Valentine's Day. Whoopeeee! (or not)  Here's the embarrassing part of my day I'd like to share: I went to Circuit City because I saw a television spot that their CDs are on sale. With a job or two, I figured I should treat myself. Justified, the Justin Timberlake CD, was on sale. Yes, I want it. Yes, I've been wanting it for a while -- ever since I saw him host SNL and watched his Christmas special. Here's where it gets tricky: I'm eager to proclaim my fascination with JT, Britney, etc, I didn't want to actually get caught  buying  his CD. It's fine to have it, but buying it is different. I saw it's spot in the racks, but no copies of it. So I had to ask for help. "Excuse me, do you have any more copies of Justin Timberlake's CD?"   I bought the new ani difranco, too, just to make sure I stay grounded.

      Last night I hung out with the girls in the philosophy department. We went to see The Company, a ballet movie with fantastic dancing, and then to  urlLink Eulogy . Where I had a Duvel!   The movie was really cool. Of course, Neve Campbell played the character she always plays, and James Franco stood around looking like James Dean. A lot of the scenes were funny, and all the dancing was incredible. Most importantly, however, was my learning about the Ritz, the moviehouse in Old City. Wow! Wednesday nights, movies are $5.50 and parking with validation is only $1. This is a serious deal. There are several theatres that play art films, foreign films, and Hollywood mainstream films. I hope next week to go back.  Then on to Eulogy. Kara has been wanting to go there to see Sean from Average Joe. We didn't see him, but we did have good beer and talk about Belgium and the department. Frances says the Belgians have a fascination with death and so there is a coffin room upstairs. Yes, a coffin. How creepy! Turns out, Alia went to Leuven, where I lived in Belgium, to check out KU and hated the rain. Also she and Frances retold the stories from one of our profs who studied there, who also gave negative reports. How funny! Mostly he complained about the weather and social life. True, the weather was a little gloomy and grey, but I had a blast. Then again, I wasn't there to study.   That was a fantastic night.

      I'm courting two companies, both of which I'm in the process of negotiating jobs with. One is for an overnight position, which of course has its benefits. The other may be more flexible, but that company is extremely disorganized. I started out with an interview in the manager's car, and just now a woman called me to set up an orientation and lost my papers. She said she has a lot of papers on her desk...   I guess I'll have to string them both along until I get a fuller picture of what's going on and can then make a decision. I hate making decisions. Cutting away, get it?

      I was just laying down for a nap due to my inability to stay awake for more than three hours when my phone rang. These days I'd prefer not to answer it, and two features make this worse: Caller ID plus knowing that every call is for me, never for a roommate. So when a local number I don't recognize calls, I get at once excited and nervous, knowing that it's likely one of the thirty-something employers I've passed out my number to.  After my weird weekend interview in the parking lot, I vowed to keep up my job search. Then I decided that it's just as well to spend that time reading or relaxing because I have a job -- perhaps I'll just look for something more fulfilling for the summer. So today, Target called. Great.  Here's the kicker: I applied for overnight stocking. I hear it's good because the pay is high and there's no customers. Now I'm rethinking my decision: especially because my interview is at 22:00. I've rediscovered the joys of going to bed early. We'll see how it turns out; I've yet to hear (obviously) whether I've passed my drug screen.

      As much as I check blogs of my friends, I should know what's worth reading and what's not. And I should try to put some good stuff up there. Too bad for anyone reading this! Still, over the weekend I changed my poem back to Frank O'Hara. As soon as I decide I have some extra cash, I'm getting his collection. Until then, I simply visit it at the bookstore down the street.  Ugh. I'm getting over a cold, and the worst of it is that it never was full-blown bad. Instead, I have minor symptoms, mostly exhaustion and lightheadedness, that I feel as though I should work through. Not enough to validate staying home from class, even though today was exceptionally bad. I really hate that the Greek phil class I'd been looking forward to is such a bore. I must have really lucked out last term, because the problems I'm facing are the very ones described by the other students. For a while, I thought I just had a sunny outlook. Should have known better!  In celebration of a long day being over, I'm parking myself on the couch for the night. (I left the house at 8:30 this morning to get a drug screen; I followed the wrong directions -- ending up at 2 Penn Street instead of 2 Penn Boulevard, wondering how a hospital could hide!).

It's a chance to start the day healthy and tend to our simplest of needs, like eating a healthy bowl of  Seven in the Morning . Its diversity of whole grains provides the pure nourishment of complex carbohydrates, protein, and fiber needed for a healthy body and mind.

      I'm a rollin' stone all alone and lost For a life of sin I have paid the cost When I pass by all the people say Just another guy on the lost highway  Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine And a woman's lies makes a life like mine O the day we met, I went astray I started rolling down that lost highway  I was just a lad, nearly 22 Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you And now I'm lost, too late to pray Lord I take a cost, o the lost highway  Now boy's don't start to ramblin' round On this road of sin are you sorrow bound Take my advice or you'll curse the day You started rollin' down that lost highway

      Just got back from the "interview." Going in, I knew it wasn't likely that I'd have to convince anyone to hire me, but it was weirder than I could have anticipated. The guy was locked out of the building where the interviews were being held, so he talked to me by his car and had me sign papers on his trunk. I was dumbfounded and didn't ask the questions I wanted answered, but I'll hear from him after I take the drug test. I did think to ask which drugs the test looked for, but I decided to keep my mouth shut for that.

      I have a job interview tomorrow. At a grocery store. I guess it's better to get an interview there than to be turned down by what I scraped from the bottom of the barrel. What do I wear? Not jeans, but I don't want to get too fancy. Hmmm.   Oh, my father warned me to watch out, because grocery stores, just like truck stops, are full of crude people.

      I have felt out of it all day. It's been so rainy, but at least it's not so cold.    What next? No plans. No money. No job. Just philosophy immersion, perhaps, so that I can remember why I'm here.  On the job front, I've applied at the grocery store and Walgreens. Next up is the food joints, several sandwich shops have signs up, but since I can't work lunch, I'll have to see how that goes. I'm always more eager to apply when I'm at home, I hate going in a place and asking... or even putting on real clothes and leaving the house. Today I'm wearing my favorite jeans, which of course have holes in them -- seemed like a good idea until I was waiting for the bus in the rain.  I did call a woman about being a nanny for her 1-year-old. Turns out we hit it off on the phone, but our hours aren't compatible. She's going to spread my name around for babysitting, though, so that will be nice. I like kids, just the right amount, if anyone asks!

      Ha! Yesterday I was running so late that I didn't have time to avoid he who must be avoided. Yes, ye olde greek prof. But the way it happened was funny, silly, and altogether apropros. How did it happen? I was barging into the Hebrew pod, late for class, and he was scurrying out of the Hebrew pod, late for class. Then, smack! We slammed into each other. I screamed, he apologized.

      I got my library card in the mail today. It's for the Elkins Park Free Library. For a voluntary donation of $25, I have full library privileges. What?  I have a little confession to make.  Monday night I heard from Lara asking whether I'd heard of My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance. As transparent as I think my love of reality television is, she seemed to hope she was informing me of a horrendous show for the first time. No! I watch each week. I like it. A lot. I think Randi is so shallow, and I like that the show is poking fun at her. I do hate that she's lying to her family, but she knows she is lying and she's decided it's okay to do that with the promise of money. Kara and I talk about this: can't she tell that Steve is putting on a show? No, we decide; she truly thinks that little of him.  My need to confess my love of trash television came about last night. We watched Scrubs, and I felt so old-fashioned to be watching a sitcom. I watch television every night, usually with Kara. Before this, I would always watch my favorite shows with the rest of the sorority house. So I find television watching naturally social, and I don't keep my mouth shut while watching.   Here's the lineup: Monday we watched American Idol, My Big Fat Obnoxious Finace, and Average Joe 2: Hawaii. Tuesday was for American Idol, Scrubs, and Real World, sometimes The Osbournes. Wednesday: American Idol, Bachelorette, Newlyweds. Thursday: Friends, The Apprentice, ER.   You may be asking yourself, what don't we watch? Simple. Survivor. Fear Factor. America's Next Top Model. Til Death Do Us Part. Real World/Road Rules Challenge. Etc. And virtually no additional television apart from what has been mentioned.

      I've had a really good weekend, and today I felt it. With so little class, it's going to take some practice for Monday to be my busiest day. I'm going to want to make the most of it, which unfortunately means spending more time in the weekends studying than I'm accustomed to doing.   Saturday I spent most of the afternoon at the Metropolitan Museum of Art with Lara. It was amazing but also exhausting to see so much stuff. We saw a Chuck Close exhibition that showed plates and proofs -- very cool. I really miss printmaking. There was so much to see; we'll not only have to go back, but we'll have to go other places. So much more than waiting out exhibitions at the Speed!  Today back at school I was really nervous, I just couldn't put my finger on it. I was so mumbly trying to describe grammar I don't know in Greek and really getting tired of my classmates. Then I sped through some reading for philosophy, seriously wanting to make the most of the once-a-week meeting. It was awful. I can't believe how little everyone is willing to say in the class, which leaves the professor to lecture, which would be fine if she prepared lectures. Instead she just talks... and talks... maybe things will get better. As it turns out, I needed to sign up for my lecture after class and ended up being the last one in the room with her. She said the class will get more active once people stop coming! :) Yeah, it is too full.  I got a library card for my township library this morning. I had to show two forms of ID to prove I'm over 18. I guess I should enjoy it while I can, it's not the first time this week I've been suspected of being younger than I am.

      Today, around 8:00, I tried to remember this morning. Couldn't. I'm used to a life of leisure, of reading and thinking without time constraints, without wearing out my body. Today was no such day.  I'm out.  My next long day should be Saturday, but it should include more fun than today did. That's no guarantee, it might be especially stressful. I have an event in the afternoon that I'm really looking forward to, but also really dreading. Has the possibility of going well or making me miserable. I'll try to be an optimist. Can't be too bad, or else I'll just bail.

      "These showers will eventually bring those spring showers, but today it's just grey." ~the forecasters on the radio just now  How refreshing. It really bums me out that it's still so cold and it's almost April.  That's not why I started to write -- that's just what I heard at the time I started this post.   I never write about class anymore. I guess it's a little bit boring, but that is what is on my mind. I have kind of a big peeve about Greek. I guess it's just my ego showing itself again. Well, Monday we did two things: scanning and chatting. Scanning is one thing I just can't do; well, I can, but I can't. Get it? Of course not. I don't  know  how to scan (put the meter on poetry) but it usually turns out right if I just try. For some reason, Monday I was too nervous to try. I had just insulted my classmate's perfume, as follows:   Jessica and Barbara standing at the board, writing lines:  Jessica: "Man, there has been this perfume stink following me around all day! It must be on my jacket." Barbara: ( solemnly ) "I just put on some perfume." Jessica: "Oh, um, maybe it's me anyway, we keep the jackets in the same closet as the kitty litter."  Plus it took me too long just to put them up, and as I was finishing my lines, the teacher started to talk (the others were done) and I basically didn't even try. So of course my lines had a lot of problems. This wouldn't bother me except that I truly usually am not so bad. But here's the worst part: whenever I ask a question, the other students answer it. Everyone starts talking, the two students and the teacher, and I can't hear any of it. Plus, the students have never seen me scan on the tests, so they don't know that I usually get it right. Only the teacher and I know that I usually get it right, and no one mentioned that. Just my present mistakes.  So we went over my lines, then went over the next two sets (which of course went smoothly), then talked about Mississippi. My teacher, who is British, is applying for tenure-track jobs. He had an interview at Ole Miss over the weekend, and I'd told him about my time there, being from Memphis, etc. So we all talked some more about his visit there, and he said he couldn't understand the local accent very well. I had to tell my father. I called him last night and he proceeded to tell me three stories of three redneck men with three different accents. I love my Daddy, and that man loves to spin a yarn. (Every story needs a happy ending.)

      I heard a song today, it really caught my ear. I was just doing the dishes, be bopping along, when the lyrics struck me. And I knew them, but hadn't thought about them being anything more than just lighthearted country pop.    Should I say it, Should I tell you how I feel, Oh I want you to know, But then again I don't,   Typically the song's title, Complicated, and singer, Carolyn Dawn Johnson, were enough to put me off. Now I'm feeling it. It's all about being angry. Okay, there's more to it than that, but I've been angry and I like it. The song, not being angry.

      Last night Kara and I went shopping in my new store. Over the weekend I bought cokes on sale at a different store, and picked up my organic produce and frozen veggie patties at Wild Oats. So last night I bought frozen vegetables, ice cream, Toasteds, orange juice, granola, cheese, and salad dressing. I got my 5% employee discount. Woo hoo.

      I'm adjusting my IM profile because, well... it's a secret, for now. If you're reading this, you're welcome and invited to look at new pictures. I posted my photographs from the wedding posted. They are awful. The prints don't look too bad, but even they are washed out. I got the Kodak Picture CD, as usual, mostly to share pics with my father, but they are really really bad.

      Yesterday I picked up a book at the Temple library that some of the professors at Hanover put together -- essays about Carol Shields. I was reading the introduction last night, and it started off talking about Carol Shields herself, what she was like, and quoted a student who heard her speak in 1996. I checked the footnote to see who it was, and it took me a few minutes to realize why I recognized the name. What she said was, "she has such a beautiful voice." Very much a beauty-queen answer. "You have this light that shines from you; that's why I want to keep you on my reality dating show." You know.    Who was she? My Rho Chi. I kind of want to find some of the other girls in my Rho Chi group and spread the word -- I just saw two of them last weekend. So, if you're reading this, know that Gwen was quoted. Immortalized in a book. I think it's hilarious.   That's my story for today. I got some photographs developed of the wedding reception, school, etc, but am horribly disappointed with them. They turned out awful, all light and dark and everyone is washed out. I've never had such bad color in prints before.

      I made pancakes this morning, with Farina and soymilk, from scratch. Yum.   I'm dreading my first Saturday at work. At least it's just four hours, and the Front End Manager always makes sure I get a break, so that's just 3.75 hours to work. The problem is the sales... this week is awful because it's a coupon sale, and not everyone will have the coupon. But store policy is that everyone gets the sale price with or without the coupon (meaning I find a coupon). So, why bother with the coupons at all?  Anyway, I'm having a pretty good time at my job. At the new store I've only had one customer get angry with me over three days, as opposed to more than one a day at the other stores. Plus, my FEM says it's great that I never get stressed out. Simple: the day I get stressed out over coupons and produce, I will jump out of my first-floor bedroom window and wait on the pigeons to eat me.   Have I forgotten about my primary responsibilities? (That's school, idiot.) No. It's just that having cut back leaves me with little to talk about on that front. Yesterday Frances read a paper that was pretty good. Afterward one of the profs who listened to her made some comment about something being ineffective. I hope it was regarding her plethora of quotes (practically reading the primary source to us). Why do I hope this? Because that way this man would not be making negative comments regarding her thoughts. Also, I happened to think those quotes were ineffective. But otherwise I truly enjoyed her paper, and she is in the minority of people in the department who read and present themselves well. Kudos. (Do you know that  kudos  is ancient Greek? It is.)

      I saw her. My teacher's wife. What a surprise, wow.   I wore some loafers that are fine enough on my feet for a normal day. However, today turned out not to be a normal day. I passed up a pretty good opportunity (just the kind of opportunity I need) because of lack of funds and pain of the feet. The funds could have been remedied, but the feet... ouch.  All is well now.

      I have been keeping an odd sleep schedule. But I started dreaming of coffee, checked the clock, and it was 6:00, so I got up and here I am.  I have class today. No big deal if all was usual, but --- my teacher led me to believe on Monday that class was cancelled Friday. Now it turns out his wife is coming in to give us a test. Good news, eh? Well, it would be if I hadn't already worked so hard. I did 60 lines more than the others, and the test won't cover those lines. I guess it is good for me too in the end, having less material to study, but I wish I hadn't bothered with all that extra.   So, time to  study this morning, I guess.

      Okay, so I made the bus  to  school. It had been my fear that, being scheduled to work today at 3:00, I would miss my bus and be late. Sure enough, I was. I tried to signal to my teacher that I had to leave, and the paranoid part of me thought he saw me shut my book (I do sit one chair away from him) and because I did that he did extra stuff. I left the classroom while the others were still going. Still, I missed the bus.   So I had to call my store. Unfortunately, the only number stored in my phone for them is to a phone that no longer exists. So I had to go back to the computer lab and try to find a current number. By the way, those labs have new computers! Sweet! I tell them I'll be 20 mins late. Then I'm wandering around, trying to decide what to do. Will I buy food? No, I'm too cheap. Will I go to the library? No, it's a beautiful day. Will I read? No, I only have my Greek books with me. So some girl comes up to me from Save the Children. What do I do? Give her my credit card and all my pertinent information. What an odd thing to happen. I always give away my money when I'm in a bad mood. (My mood was particularly bad because I felt like the teacher was purposely showing me he could hold class over based on some stupid stuff I'd said earlier.)  Actually, when I got to work, it was no big deal that I was late. No one even wanted an excuse. Strange, but cool for now. I think I'll go to bed soon. Real soon.

      Maybe I grew up hearing a little too much of that. These little arms of mine can't wield 40-pound bags of dog food.   Like I said yesterday, I've been reading de Beauvoir. I just started, and I'm in a section about "destiny" in the form of biology. I'd never thought about this before, but there was a time before people understood the workings of their own bodies. No one knew about eggs in women or exactly how babies came about. From the looks of it, men  put  babies in women. The problem was that men can't put babies just anywhere, but few who investigated the matter were willing to explore the possibility of women having anything to do with it.

      This is it. The new store opens today. I don't know what time. I called in last night (I missed the orientation because I was in Indy) and found that I'll be working today 14:00 - 18:00. They said that's before it opens. Hmm... rumor has it that the store opens at 4 p.m. Odd, huh? I hope some customers know about it. Wait, maybe I don't...  So I'm just waiting to leave for that. I've been reading de Beauvoir and playing with the cat.   My Greek teacher has a campus visit to Ole Miss on Friday. I could hardly contain my excitement. I got so happy just thinking about someone I like being someplace I like. But part of what makes this so strange is that he'll miss class; he missed most of yesterday; we all missed last Friday; only he and I met last Wednesday; before that was spring break. It's like class is something we have when we're all free, which hasn't been too frequently of late. So much for my tuition dollars.

      Kara and I have different tastes in music. Sometimes there's some overlap, but we tend to make fun of each other. Her favorite radio station is B101, which is adult contemporary and has television spots featuring middle aged white women declaring their love for the mix of Celine Dion and forgettable easy listening one-hit groups. When B101 played all holiday music beginning in early November, Kara listened to it anyway because she says it's the only good station in Philly.   So when we were in her car going to the grocery, I heard some station identification that was not B101. I said, "Kara! Why aren't you listening to B101?" She replied, "I can't find it! What number is B101?"   The story ought to end there, but I doesn't. I say, "Um, what number do you think it is?" (Meanwhile she's freaking out, frantically scanning stations, ashamed of herself for listening to anything but B101.) She says, "I don't know! I don't know!"  To cover her silliness, she says that it has to be 101-point-something and she didn't know the last bit. Okay, sweetheart.

      Sometimes, a person can be too prepared. Today, such was the case for me. I worked so hard all weekend and was proud of myself for getting everything done in the midst of a "vacation" and wedding and visiting and the bumpiest airplane ride I've experienced.   My one class almost didn't show up, then the teacher tells me he'll miss half an hour but to stay and work collaboratively (he says this to me alone). So I sit there, the others finally show up, and we "collaborate" but they don't want my help and they hadn't looked at the lines yet. What does this mean? That I could have been just fine without doing anything.  I also made a sandwich to eat at school. I had to do some fancy finagling to get it to fit in my bag with the other things I needed to bring. I ended up not eating it. I never eat the sandwiches I bring -- usually they're breakfast on Tuesday morning. Tonight it was supper; I just finished it.  My favorite approach to class is my philosophy teacher's, of late: "you might want to read this." Basically she assumes we don't read and teaches as if we don't read. So why did I read? So I could sit bored and frustrated in class?  I'm so tired, I might not make it until Average Joe comes on... and I'm way ahead in all my schoolwork. Maybe I'll clean the bathtub. Maybe I should not have cut back on class this term.

      I made it through Stephanie's wedding. Now she's married, I've seen everything she's been talking about for so long, and it was very nice. Especially the reception -- I've never been to one that is so fancy. There was a meal and DJ and all that. My favorite part, however, was the best man's toast, which I will include in its entirety right here: "I've been friends with Bobby for five years. Little did I know when I introduced him to my little sister four years ago that it would come to this." Fin.

      There are things I write that I don't post. Believe it. I was just reading things from the past six months in case I'm called upon to tell a story about my life, supposing that anyone cares. I wish I didn't read back. I've been putting it off because I knew it would bring me down. There's a lot that has happened that I don't think about, good and bad.

      If a guy named John calls and invites you to join my fanclub, respectfully decline.  He did Steph's nails and we chatted for the three hours that took. Whenever we'd get quiet, he'd say, "Jessica, tell me another story!" Chances are, he was listening more closely than she.  I spent all day talking, never sure when anyone was listening, and I'm going to quit right now. Oh, and I don't think I'll ever marry and I'm almost sure I'll never have kids. Check back every ten years, but I'm about as certain as anyone can be.

      What a strange day this has turned out to have been, but it's fantastic that it went from bad to good rather than the other way around. Started out with bumping my head, cleaning cat puke, acting (being) an airhead idiot, and on and on and on.  I go to work this afternoon, for the first time in a new store (as a one-time special, nonetheless) and meet up with the person in charge (actually referred to as the PIC, how p/c). Finally I'm not treated as disposable. Everything is going great, I'm having fun and loving all the attention I'm getting. Some guy tries to be all sweet to me, saying "Jessica, that's a great name." Sure, especially since it's the most common name for the year I was born and the next four!  In short, I love being in charge, I love being the center of attention, and I love greeting people and letting them go. What worries me is that I've been in a funk for a week and  this  made me feel great -- what has my life come to?

      Yuck. I don't know whether I'm nervous about leaving town, nervous about going to work in J-town tonight, or just getting a bug. I feel awful. I felt awful going into class this morning, too, and it's one of those funny things about life. It happened just like I'd hoped it would, and ended up just like I'd feared it would.

      In just about 24.5 hours, I'll be in Indianapolis.   I'm getting a little nervous. That and when I told Alex I'm going, he told me about his time in Indy (just a layover) and ended up saying he hopes I have a better time than he did. Well, I certainly hope so, and I guess I'm glad he's on my side.

      Today, March 16, things are not going my way. I'm not having a horrible day, but forces beyond my control are having more than a little influence over my life. I need to get creative about how to handle this.  Yesterday when I got home, we had a note from the apartment office saying that our hot water would be shut off Tuesday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. So I took a shower last night and thought it wouldn't be a big deal. I misread the note, and all our water is shut off. I was wondering about this, because up until 10:00 or so we had hot water, and I figured it was just what was left in the heaters which had since been shut off. No. We have no water now. I'm worried about having only one toilet flush remaining. Had I read the letter correctly, I would have pulled aside at least one jug of water. As it is, I can only use Kara's 1/2 litre Evian bottles, but I don't think that's right.  Problem two: It's snowing. Seriously snowing. I needed to go shopping today but I'm still too nervous to drive through snow, plus I'm too lazy to clean off my car, plus I don't like getting my feet wet doing it. If I don't go to Target today, I'll have to go either before class tomorrow or after work tomorrow. It would be good to get out today so I don't have to worry about the stupid toilet problems, but I have not washed my face.   All this seems so frivolous, but really it would be so simple -- today I would translate until the cows come home, at which point I would go to Target and finally kick back with American Idol and pack for Indy!

      I have a new diagnosis for all that ails me: perhaps growing up does not suit me. In some ways, I've always been "old", never caring for childish toys and games, preferring bikes, reading, and sitcoms that are for all generations throughout my life. However, in many, many, ways, I would love to be seventeen forever. I want to be selfish, I want to be irresponsible, I want eat junk food and weigh 110 pounds, I want to try everything for the first time and not "know better." I can't stand it that I can say "such-and-such happened ten years ago" and remember it. It struck me today when I was talking about things that happened 18 years ago, and I was not a baby at the time. The problem is that I still act like I'm 17, but my body is growing up. Has grown up. I suppose it's time for me to catch up with it.

      Spring Break has come and gone without more than a hint of spring. Today I finally broke down and admitted I still need a coat. I guess I could be okay without a coat if I were doing something simple, but I took a long walk to the post office with a pocket full of pennies and wore a coat.   I've been thinking about going back to school tomorrow, and what I'll say to those who might ask me about my break:   Alex:  "Why do you want to know? I don't want you to make judgments about me based on what I do with my spare time."   Josh and Lucy:  (hopefully they'll be together, because I think Josh will appreciate the joke and Lucy will be appalled) "The usual -- Hard drugs. Casual sex. Enjoying the perks of my rock-and-roll lifestyle."  If the woman from my Greek class asks, I might use either of the above responses, depending on my mood and whoever else is in the room. I'm a little frustrated with her, for a happening last Friday I didn't write about because I was trying to "let things go," "have a sunny disposition," etc. Long story short: I was finishing my midterm test, she finished and started chatting up the professor. Tells him she'll be in the library researching all spring break, maybe she'll drop by and see him, she's had four midterms in as many days, lists off what they were ... on and on and on. Meanwhile, I'm trying to finish my test. So, supposing I decide to talk to her, which will only happen if she refuses to talk about what  she  did on her break -- and I'm guessing she'll ask about me if she chooses not to admit she did not spend all week in the library -- whatever I say to her will make it clear that I that I don't complain about doing what I choose to do, that I had an enjoyable time but am perfectly happy to start back up with class. She's at least fifty years old (and that's being generous with her youth), so why go to college if she's going to complain about it?

      I went to the mall last night at King of Prussia. It's huge. It's like two malls put together -- seriously, you jaunt through a parking lot between them. There were so many stores, some of which in multiple occurrences. There were at least two Gaps, three or more FYEs, I don't know what all else because part of the time I was confused. Also, though, there were stores I'd never seen before, and lots and lots of stores bigger than I'd seen before. Wow! Unlike earlier this week when Shannon and I went to Franklin Mills and immediately decided we did NOT want to be there, I knew right off that this was the place for me. I got there a little after 6 and stayed until they closed at 9:30 and still didn't look at everything I wanted to see.   But besides 85 cent tolls each way and a coke, I didn't buy anything. This is good because I need to save my money, and this is bad because I needed a few things and now I have to shop again. Or maybe it is good and good!

      I'm having flashbacks. This week I spent some time with a friend of mine I've actually only seen once before -- when I met him and we spent a few days together. Mike was a friend of Celeste, and we all hung out together and I helped him out a little. So when he came back to Philly this week, we went out and had a good time. Now he's gone back to North Carolina, and, well, it's not as if seeing him actually means anything. I don't know why. I don't know whether I'd rather have friends all over or never to have met so many people I forget about. Maybe I'd rather stop meeting people, because I treat everyone I meet as if we'll only know each other for a little while.   I spend more than my share on temptation trying to cool my swollen tongue I gorged myself on all that free good will and left the others numb

      It's time for me to start being serious about reconsidering my life and working toward making real changes. This could be anything from getting a real job in another city to actually moving into the city to be closer to my friends.  I hate my suburbs. I hate middle-aged housewives.   Last night Mike and I went to see a movie. For a while, it looked like we were going to be the only ones in the theatre. Then I was kind of glad to see an old couple come in, just because the theatre house was already creepy and deserted, so I was glad to have some company. Then, just as the movie is starting, three 55-ish women come in laughing like drunk teenagers. They sit in the row in front of us, which is the row in front of the other people. The old folks turn and glare at them, as if politely asking them to quiet down. I wait through the tail end of the preview, and the opening credits, and these women are still chatting away. So once the characters start talking and these other patrons are also talking, I go over and ask them if they could be quiet until it's over. They look at me, then start coughing and yawning. They settle down, then don't laugh at the funny parts and do laugh at some pathetic parts that aren't funny, then start chatting again. So I tell them they're being rude and can rent the DVD if they want to comment on the movie. Then we move farther back in the theatre and over to the other side. I can't believe they made me so mad, but I also can't believe how they were acting. Anyway, too bad I wasted 20 minutes of the show listening to them -- the movie was fantastic.

      What a day for my blowdryer to kick the bucket, even though it's been good to me for a very long time. I spent all morning cleaning, took a late shower, and now my hair is wet and I'm meeting a friend in an hour. It's too cold to go out with wet hair, not to mention the obscene amount of shopping I've been doing lately leaves me with little money for such a purchase. Finally, Kara and her blowdryer are out of town until later tonight. Grr!

      I sure am watching recorded American Idol.  I'm loving today. Wow, I think I made someone's day. Maybe, but I'll never know. Maybe I will. Don't count on it. Things come, things go, money, people, stuff, you name it. Memories.   Today I've been thinking about: Pocket Rockers. Automobiles pre-seatbelts. Mint Tea. Big brown eyes.  Oh, my mind has not been empty today -- not by a long shot. Mostly I've been thinking about a new place for my professional interest: Environmental Aesthetics. Yeah, I just made that up. But I did read a catalog ad about a book examining why people who adore beauty in nature (sunsets, beaches, mountains, the like) seem not to care about destroying it (building suburbs, driving SUVs, pesticides, the like). So what is it that we give nature in our appreciation of it? Also, just as a side note, someone else wrote about how our appreciation of art has changed due to our  attention spans . How odd! It sounds incredibly familiar, but I've never heard references to attention spans except in ads for ADD.

      Last night I had a strange dream involving a church elevator, Simon Cowell, and cartons of cigarettes.  I'm enjoying doing nothing, but that is leaving me with very little to write. There are seriously no thoughts in my head. Well, I am very glad I don't live alone. It's nice to have some time to myself, but I would much rather have someone around. Kara comes back tomorrow. We'll see how things are, then.  I need to do some big-time spring cleaning. I bought some of those Mr Clean erasers; there are spots on the walls from where I've dropped picture frames. My frames are so cheap that they leave marks like crayons without it showing on the frame. I've yet to begin cleaning. Also need to dust the mini blinds etc. I'm dreading summer and having the windows open all the way, we'll have a dusty gross mess soon enough.   Yeah, I just wrote a paragraph about cleaning. My life is dull right now, and I'm trying to leave all the excitement at the store so that I don't let it get to me.

In the meantime, I feel like a teenager again. I went shopping today and bought some big stompers -- Sketchers. And my pants are from Aeropostale, I can't believe I found any there I want, and they are low, long, and flared. I'm too young to grow up. Don't tell anyone.

      I worked last night. It's not too bad, but I'm glad I'm not looking to do anything like that long-term. I think some celebratory shopping is in order for today.  My father wrote me a letter. It's 33 pages long. He just tells story after story... about water skiing, tying beer to his foot and floating out in the lake, mishearing AM radio commercials, hot plates at restaurants, so on, and on, and on. He's fantastic. His new line: "That's sweet, baby, now what is it?" I'm mentioning him because his birthday is soon and I'm fresh back from the post office mailing his gift. He typically sends something via Priority Mail more than once a month to me, so I did too, right back to him.  Speaking of post, if you don't watch Newlyweds, you should let me tell you about it. Jessica Simpson was trying to figure out whether the postparty she's singing in occurs before or after the event. She associates post with postage, and decides she's singing before the event just like you'd post a letter before you mail it.

      Look forward to morning again. Bring back the peaceful sigh of being in tune with yourself, those carefree days when all you have to do is enjoy physical and mental harmony. That's a Zen moment, where health, mental balance, spiritual fulfillment come together and you can be the best you are.  We believe Optimum Zen helps carry that feeling throughout the day, promoting those complete moments of mind, body, and spirit. Through Optimum Zen we have captured that satisfying essence and inner balance with a blend of organic whole grains, gently sweetened, combined with the subtle warmth of ginger, the tang of dried cranberries, and the crunch of blended grains and soy. Optimum Zen provides a serenity and calm for your busy world.  That's only half the box. I'm glad eating the right cereal can improve my life.

      Yesterday I went to Blockbuster. I was already feeling beat-down, and so when things didn't go my way, I let them go someone else's. I picked up three movies total, and took them to the counter, where the clerk was telling me about Cold Creek Manor. Great, I thought, a chatty video store guy... then I look and see I'd picked up a copy of it. I ask him if I could take it back and switch for what I wanted, and he said I'd really like the one I accidentally picked up. Why would he think that? Well, I decide to keep it for the ease of it -- I have unlimited 99 cent rentals until March 15, so I figure I'll come back later in the week.  I'm halfway through it. Maybe it gets better. But I certainly never would have picked it out for myself.  Oh, I got hours for Sunday - Monday - Tuesday - Thursday. Great. We'll see how that goes.

      In addition to studying very diligently for tomorrow's midterm, I have taken quite productive breaks: watching syndicated sitcoms and locating the new store where I'll be working. What did I learn?   I was watching 3rd Rock from the Sun, a favorite of mine because I didn't see all the episodes when they were first on, so these many-year-old repeats are almost all new to me. Well, as the show opens, the characters are opening their mail, and one asks, "what would a day on Earth be like without mail?" The other responds, "like Sunday." Needless to say, this really set me off thinking. As I've mentioned before, I absolutely love Sunday and I absolutely love getting mail and seeing Bob. But, Bob never comes on Sunday. So, my favorite part of the day does not occur on my favorite day of the week! Tortuous!

      There is a major annoyance in my life. No, it's not you, unless you have short grey hair and gigantic glasses and teeth so big I can only pray they are ill-fitted dentures. If you still think you qualify as my life's major annoyance, you must be but a minor annoyance that is intensified by my irritation at this person.   I stopped to think, would I all the sudden be happy if this person were removed from my life? After really wanting to say YES, I was realistic and admitted to NO, this person will not determine whether I'm happy or sad. I'm still trying to convince myself of this.   In better news, I found a bunch of Keller Williams songs stashed in a folder labeled Carole King. And now it's time to watch Newlyweds, speaking of Carole King, last week Jessica Simpson said she had no idea who Carole King is. The least I can hope is that she's being genuine there, because that is not something cute to say in pretending to be dumb. I'm good at playing dumb to try to be cute. I'm not good at it, but I'd never claim ignorance of Carole King. I'm not actually dumb!

      I've been hearing all kinds of reports about Disney. I don't really listen to them, so of course I don't understand what's going on. Why should I break from speaking only of the most important issues to mention this? Because I am a Disney stockholder. Yes, what has become of me? It's not by choice, friends, and by now I'd surely rather have the cash. My grandparents bought 12 shares for me on my 12th birthday, and I'll get to cash them in when I marry.   So, should I have gone to the elections simply to withhold my vote for Eisner? They were in Philly, if only ... if only ... Should I marry now to get top-dollar for my stock, or will things get even better now with all this internal turmoil at the House of Mouse? Could I call a stockbroker -- are they accustomed to dealing with such foolishness?

      I'm officially done with half of an entire class. Halfway through the semester's readings, done with the presentation and short paper, all that is left is another short paper and a term paper. I'm pumped!  I'm looking into what I'm going to do over the summer. I have some exciting options, if I get my act together and apply for them! I'll probably save the application-writing process for spring break (next week) unless I decide to visit the career center to consult materials on how to make a CV.   It's such a beautiful day, I wish I had something to do besides translate. I'm thinking of putting on a jacket and opening the windows all the way so I can pretend I'm outside. I better do that soon -- before the little kids take over the playground!

      This is a great time of year. Next Saturday, if I'm not working, I think I'll go to the Dad Vail Regatta. I went to a regatta last year and really enjoyed it; this one is supposed to be huge. It's just really cool to watch. I think the last one I saw was in the fall, I know it because now I'm remembering the pics I took and the trees were certainly orange.  The semester is more or less done. I have two more class meetings on Monday, neither of which require additional work, so that leaves me with one final exam and one term paper. Neither is a culmination of the course in terms of being comprehensive. Just found out today that my Greek exam will only cover Odyssey 19. He says we've had enough tests over Iliad 24, the book we read for the first 9 weeks of the semester. I think we've had enough tests, period.  That's what I'm supposed to be doing now -- writing my term paper. I started, a little, then decided to quit before I actually began. Good idea, huh? Maybe I'll spend Friday night doing something a little more fun than sitting here feeling guilty for not working.

      My team won. 1 for 3 isn't  too  bad.  Work was okay. I left early, so missed out on a chunk of pay.  I didn't set the VCR right and didn't see ER.

       I copied this off some article I linked to this morning... it's not as interesting as the headline promised, but even if it's not all true individually I can see how it's true among some of my peers.   Here are the highlights by major field of study: Medicine, Dentistry, Veterinary Sciences: Medical students lived the longest of all, but they were the most likely to suffer an alcohol-related death. This was also the third most likely field--after law and divinity--to die from an accident, suicide, or violence. Although medical students were the second heaviest smokers while in college, they kicked the habit once they graduated since their death rates from lung cancer were so low.  Science and Engineering: Since these students were least likely to smoke, they had similar mortality rates as the medical students. They also had the lowest heart disease rates overall.  Theology: Although divinity school students had the lowest blood pressure and were the least likely to drink alcohol, they were twice as likely to die from respiratory diseases later in life. Overall, they had a 10 percent greater risk of death than the medical students. Oddly, theology scholars were the most likely of all to succumb to a fatal accident, suicide, or violent death.  Law: Students of the law died the earliest of all majors except liberal arts and social sciences with a 30 percent higher risk of death than the medical students. Their untimely demise can be explained by this: They were the heaviest smokers.  Liberal Arts and Social Sciences: These students, like their friends who studied law, died the earliest, but they were only half as likely as medical students to die by suicide or an accident. However, they were twice as likely as medical students to die of lung cancer due to their propensity to smoke. Overall, their risk of death was 42 percent higher than the medical students.

      My Greek prof only assigned 12 lines so we could catch up. I'm caught up.  I only work 4.5 hours tonight. I don't work until 6:00 p.m.  The Cards have one more chance to beat the Phillies, and the game is televised, in the afternoon. I'll watch.  New Friends! New ER! I'll get to watch both on tape and skip commercials.  That Maybelline makeup is pretty nice. It's really light (in color) so it doesn't make me look brown. I like it. I think when I got color-matched at Clinique I had more freckles. Now I'm porcelain.  I have a full tank of gas, a hot cup of coffee, and the day ahead of me.

      Three times yesterday I was just convinced that it was Thursday. I guess because I never work on Wednesday.

I came home exhausted, watched the Cards lose, and fell asleep hard and early.

      Today was a special day. I bought drugstore makeup! See what the depths of poverty will do to a girl. I'll let you know whether Maybelline is good enough stuff. At least with my skin tone, I just buy the lightest foundation they make.   I went to CVS to use Kara's discount card; I spent ten minutes in line and got called cute by her boss.

      I have a special place in my heart for etymology. Too bad I didn't have this love of the subject when I actually took it in high school! Anyway, in philosophy it's common to try to find fundamental meanings of words by looking into their origins. Add this to my study of Greek and you've got a near-obsession.   So I'm translating away like a good girl, and there's a word,  rugea  as best as I can transliterate it, which means rug or blanket. I get all excited, and check my dictionary (which includes extensive etymologies for most words). To my utter dismay, I find this dictionary reporting "rug" coming from Scandinavian roots: Norwegian  rugga  or Swedish  rugg  for  long hair . Somehow the word links up with  rude  but I don't understand that connection. Okay, back to work now.

      Had a spontaneous lecture last night in the grocery store (as a shopper) to Kara about skopophilia. I'm out to change the world! I really like talking to her.  Had another spontaneous lecture last night in the check out line (as a shopper) to Kara about plastic bags. Yes, I bring my own sacks to the grocery store. Especially since I work there I see how wasteful people are. They buy food that's already overpackaged and then ask for double bags "and don't make them heavy." Yeah. Anyway, I told her to feel good about what we've done. She says we recycled... I say we reused, and explain how reusing is better than recycling. The cashier, who is lacking in brain cells and has already caused us problems, tells us that they recycle plastic bags, "You know that bench out front? It's made of recycled bags!" I know for a fact that most of the bags that get "recycled" at my store were never used.

      I still love spring.  I still have yet to finish either of my assignments for today! Once I'm away from philosophy for too long, it's hard to get back in. Example: today's assignment is an abstract for our term paper. I know what I want to address but I don't know the answer. Question: what truly exists, and how are the objects we encounter in the world related to what truly exists?  If I'm not mistaken, I'm back to philosophy question one. If a tree falls in the forest and no one was around to hear it, did it make a noise?

      As much as I'm looking forward to finishing this school year, I have no idea what I'll do in the summer. I've never been away from school and my family and all organization before. It'll just be me and Athena and the grocery store. Hopefully some of my friends will want to hang out some, but I know that a couple of them will be spending large chunks of the three-month vacation out of town. Frances is going to Montreal, but has to keep the lease on her apartment until August and will be starting a new lease in June! That's at least five months of rent for two places she won't be! Crazy. Other friends will be working full-time, or at least that is the plan. Maybe I'll get inspired to read up for prelims. I've been enjoying reading some Nietzsche, James, and Buber lately (all concerning a particular topic of interest to me). Maybe those dull moderns will enlighten me...

      Went to work this morning around 8:30 and picked up my schedule and paycheck. I got a raise! Or, it finally went through that I'm not getting training pay anymore. Woo Hoo. Kind of funny that people recognized me out of uniform, too, while I was shopping. I guess tall redheads do stand out.  I slept some, watched Reality Bites (I only watched half of it last week, so I just saw the end), watched some of the NFL draft, and tried to do a little Greek. My computer is giving me grief. Maybe I'll finish soon enough. I'll be glad to be done with Greek just so I can refocus on philosophy. Yes, I took breaks from translating to read Nicomachean Ethics. Maybe I'll take another just to finish off the assignment.

      I was telling Phil some stuff yesterday and he said: "You certainly can take care of yourself. The first couple of times I talked to you, I thought you were a girl who needed some help. But no -- she's in control."  Following this, I told him what I thought of him when I first met him. Makes sense; I found him condescending and overly nurturing.

      Woke up trying to think about Parmenides. Some days I'm not sure about philosophy. For instance, yesterday at Ben's talk, there was a heated discussion about analytic philosophy. I have no interest in that, so I ended up talking about mice and the weather with Bassam. Not exactly philosophical.   Ben's point was about the need for negative facts. His prime example was "John is not home." Essentially, that tells us nothing. Turns out no one quite understood even what a fact is, according to Ben and Russell's account. Something that actually exists just like furniture in the world. Hmm... and having too many of them is a problem, for some reason.  Back to Parmenides and my problem at hand. I have to write a paper. Nothing is striking me. These days philosophy talk just makes me feel all pretentious, I guess because I've been explaining it to people who have other interests. That plus I'm still reading a lot of Nietzsche.

      Weird thing just happened and kind of freaked me out. Some woman came up to my door and knocked. I figured she must be confused and just ignored her. When she knocked again, I figured I better see what's up. She wanted to use the phone. So what do I do? Invite her in, of course.   Man, this is why I shouldn't live alone. I can't say no.

      Today was really long. Not bad; for the first time in a while I can't believe all the parts went together.  1. Greek test. Yikes, it was over the section I hadn't prepared at all. Out of 219 lines, he chose the the last 14 for the test. I gambled and lost. So I made up stuff. I'm not even familiar with the story, so it was very wrong. Creative but wrong.  2. Waiting for WIP. I almost went home because I was exhausted. But I decided to stay with the promise of cookies. So I heard Ben's paper on Russell's negative facts in logical atomism. I don't know what that is. Okay, so I know a little, but it's not the kind of thing I want to think about.  3. Horses. I went with the philosophy crew to the bar afterwards. I had a good time chatting.  4. Pancakes and French fries for supper.

I saw him on a Comcast special with the Indigo Girls and enjoyed him, but I asked a friend to recommend some music and she said she's been listening to him. So I bought his most recent album as well as one which earned him a Grammy almost ten years back.  He sings the blues, but man is he a happy blues singer. I am thoroughly pleased.

      Sometimes I wonder how much the music I listen to affects the way I act. Other times I hear something and think, "that's a great lyric," but apart from the music and drawly singer, it's not great.  Here's one that struck me yesterday. I put Audioslave in my CD player yesterday morning and have played it through about five times since:  I've been watching While you've been coughing I've been drinking life While you've been nauseous And so I drink to health   Actually, this is not earth-day oriented. I usually get a little sad about the state of the world on Earth Day. And this afternoon I'll go to the grocery store and sell people their preservative-laden, super processed, over packaged food, which they'll demand to have double bagged.

      Yeah, I'm a dork and looked it up. Yeah, I'm a dork and have grammar books and the Dictionary of Modern American Usage (see why I'm perfect for that writing job?). Instance one: "couple minutes".  Couple  is used as an adjective, but it's not an adjective, it's a noun. This is "slipshod" and "poor usage". Instance two: "couple of minutes" is correct. I'm not going to hold it against someone who says it; though it's nice to know my instincts are on target.

      Made it to school and back successfully. Class was really nice -- surprisingly.  I like getting home at 2:30, too. I was hungry enough for a big lunch: fries, Gardenburger fully loaded, and a salad. I had to wait 20 minutes for the fries to cook, so it was like actually eating a meal. Yum.  Then Kara got home and we went for a walk. She thanked me for making the bathroom so sparkly. :) As far as I know, she doesn't read this, and now that the link is out of my profile (thanks to new IM friends who have no business reading it) she has no chance to pick it up. Anyway, we walked and talked and it's a great way for us to spend time together. Her life is a little crazy, and I'm flattered she's telling me about her boy troubles and asking for advice.  Then I napped. I've been sleeping through the night for about 6 hours, but as long as I can sleep a bit in the afternoon it's all good. I'm working on an application for a really promising job -- I have to provide a writing sample, though, on a topic I have nothing prepared for, but if I can whip something up today and tomorrow I should really wow them.   So maybe I've wasted a couple of minutes of your day. Here's something to ponder: "couple minutes" or "couple of minutes": which is correct? Couple means two, so if it's a direct substitution, "couple minutes" is correct. I don't like the way it sounds, but people say it. Is there a right and wrong?

      The weather is fine and I'm going to walk to the bus stop today. I hope I time it about right -- I neither want to wait too long for the bus nor miss it. I walked pretty often in the snow, just to save myself the hassle of clearing my car and parallel parking on a snow filled street.   I only have one hour of class today which I'm more or less prepared for, and I don't work again until tomorrow afternoon. So what will I be doing? Writing an abstract for a term paper I've yet to think about (just found out Monday that an abstract is required!) and apply for more jobs. Maybe one of these days someone will want to hire me besides a grocery store. Anyone have advice for a high-paying hourly job? I'm not in the mood for a career, not to mention I'm not exactly qualified for one.

      One personality trait of a virtuous person that I really need to work on is giving up credit sometimes. You know, doing something nice without demanding recognition. A lot of the time, for me, I get recognition just for doing my job well (like at the grocery store -- if I bag an order, the customers gush. But it's my job).  This morning I spent half an hour scrubbing the bathroom. It kind of got out of hand, and the tub was a little dingy. As soon as the chemical smell left the room, I was going to shower and enjoy the fresh shower. Kara was asleep and I figured she was skipping class. Ten minutes after I finish, she wakes up, and now she's showering. In MY clean shower. I can't be mad at her, but I certainly am mad that it happened. Mostly because she never bothers to clean anything except the dishes once or twice a week. Or she'll wipe the mirrors, and tell me about it afterwards.  I should just relax. It's not like the shower is going to be dirty after her one shower. I do wish she'd notice my hard work. But since she never cleans, she doesn't realize I spent half an hour scrubbing to get the tub and shower walls clean.

      I got a weird email from my mother. Here is the entire message, omitting only "Good Morning Sweetie" and "Love Mom" which I might as well put back in for the effect. Suffice it to say I don't understand what she's talking about or why she told me.   I spent all day in class....and they stuffed my head with all kinds of facts, but I am not sure that I can use them.  There was a section on Toxicology that scared me (it should scare any mother). The speaker is a specialist in the field of Drug Overdose...he comes from the Chattanooga area and had horror stories to tell. It seems that cocaine is the least of our worries....methamphetamine is a big problem there ( and here too)  There were sections on Cardiac (I knew that stuff already...probably could have taught it better that the guy that did) a section on Electrolytes (not my favorite, but I was pretty familiar with DKA, SIADH and K problems) and then a section on environmental emergencies ... drowning and hypothermia and GSWs. The hypothermia is not typical here, but we surely have our share of gunshots. All in all a good day.

      I had a strange dream! I'm in my car with the windows down, in line to make a right turn on some street. My friend had been driving behind me in his car, and he zipped by -- I assumed he must be going straight. I wondered what was down that road, and I wondered who was in the car with him. I didn't see the passenger until the drove past. Then when he gets to the front of the line I'm in, he makes a quick right pulling in front of someone else.  Then we're on the same road again, and I can hear him and his passenger talking. I try to make out the words, but all I can hear is my name.   I know my friend, I don't know his passenger (I'm thinking mom or grandma), I don't know his car, I don't know the roads. So the only familiar part of the dream is me, my friend, and my car.

I can do five pages in one morning; I can't stop at five pages and have it be a coherent paper.

      Today, at work, I'm on break upstairs in the "lounge" with five baggers, all high school girls. They talk about tons of stuff, one thing is the nametags. Apparently minors wear yellow name tags; the rest are white. I figured that was just a newer design for when there were none of the others left. So they talk about this one 15-year-old who was working too much and lost her hours when the bosses realized her age. They all reveal their ages, all 16 or 17, and then they turn to me (I'm not participating in the conversation, but they can't help but notice I'm listening). "How old are you?" I tell them. One says, "What a great age, 23." I wonder why.  It occurs to me that I've mentioned being 23 twice this weekend. Remember, this isn't new to me.

      This is what they talk about with kids, or what they did talk about before they got "over-involved." That having a child participate in karate lessons or scouts or have music lessons helps them with school by showing them that learning is fun and encouraging them to develop discipline and good work habits. In other words, a few hours a week doesn't short them from school, sleep, and family; rather, it keeps them from wasting time wandering around and playing without focus.   Such for me. I work, I play, and then instead of having all day to do the work I should complete in a few (or 7 or 8 or 12) hours, I have to sit and do it. It feels good to be productive! Last night when Lara left after a fun day of exploring, walking around the Italian Market and South Street shopping, plus a couple of movies, I made myself do 20 minutes of Greek before bed. Now I should be on track for class if I do a little more tonight and tomorrow morning. I always do Greek in the morning before class.  This morning I should have been finishing a short Aristotle paper that's been hanging over me for a while, but instead I've been working on my resume. Something is in the works... shhh!

      I watched Reality Bites for a little life advice tonight. Every time I see it, something new hits me. This time: Troy in the diner is reading Being and Time. Yikes.  Quotes:  Troy: "The only thing you have to be by the time you're 23 is yourself."  Mother: "You shouldn't have any trouble getting a job, sugar booger. Why, I saw a piece on the news about a little retarded boy working the cash register at the Burger Rama." Lelaina: "But I'm not retarded, I was valedictorian of my university." Father: "Well, you don't have to put that down on your application."  Troy: "You're a pathological optimist." Lelaina: "You're pathological."  Lelaina: "You always fall for these dumb philosophy groupie types." Troy: "They're not dumb; they're just depressed."

      I took a walk with Kara just now. I told her about those essays I've been reading in Feminist Perspectives on Eating Disorders. We had a nice chat; the irony was that we took a walk to tone our asses.

      Nearly once an hour at work, a customer tells me that I must not be from around here. Usually that's it. Today someone (actually another associate) told me he could tell because I have an accent. Seriously, I don't think I've ever heard that before. Typically, it's "you can't be from Memphis, you don't have an accent."

      1. It's crazy how the weather can affect my mood. Today's sunny and beautiful, just like me. :)  2. I bought some fake turkey sandwich slices. They look gross, but taste okay. They're good for me.  3. No word from the department yet. Keep your fingers crossed!  4. Homer's vocabulary is too big for my taste.

      I just sent off an email asking a question I  need  to know the answer to. I've needed to know for a while, but there is that pleasure in not knowing that comes from the hope that things will go well. That hope beats the knowledge that things are not going well, but can't compare to the knowledge that things really are going well.  This concerns money. I haven't heard about funding for next year yet, and it seems like the kind of thing they'd have to announce by April 15. I bet I was overlooked, again, even though my graduate adviser made a "special note" to see that I am considered. If I'm not funded, I'll be devastated. I won't know what to do. Throw away this year's work and get a real job? Pay for another year and get on the MA track?

      I slept through the night! I got 8 hours! Good ones too -- 11 to 7.  Cleaning my desk really worked, although I didn't really get around to much Aristotle afterwards. Today I don't work until 4:00, so this is the closest thing I've had to a free day in a while. I need to play catch up with schoolwork, but that is more fun than going to campus or work all day!

      Yeah, so I had plans to take my test while my prof taught his 10:40 class. This, for me, meant catching the 9:50 shuttle to campus, arriving by 10:20, finding him in his office, and taking a test. No biggie.   The bus was late. I didn't bring my umbrella. It was raining. I get to campus at 10:40. He didn't leave the test out for me to find. I sat in the classroom reading Nietzsche for two hours until class started. Then I had to stay after to take the test. Then I had to entertain myself until the next shuttle back to my town left. No wonder I never do anything fun -- I spend hours upon hours waiting around campus. Without an office, the only stuff I have is what I carry in my bag, so that excluded working on my paper or writing my language petition.  The test was fine. Alex thinks I'm busy. I hate it when people accuse me of being busy.

      I think I have it. If it exists, I do.   Basically, the premise is that employers encourage their employees to be happy all the time (i.e., my "life is terrific" button, those motivational posters and calendars, etc.). Fine enough, and there is some truth in acting happy to be happy. But evidently this makes people go nuts.   I tend to have fine days every day -- really, I do -- but I tell people 70 times a day "have a good evening/afternoon/day" and it becomes meaningless. Every day might be a good day, but then what about the  really  good days? Our language won't admit to that without falling to silly words like fabulous, terrific, the like. Gag me.

      Against my better judgment, I am going to bed.  I've been thinking. There are people who run late, who forget things, who care but don't see their irresponsibility as a problem. I want to be one of those people. Instead, I am a person who acts like them but is bothered. Stupid upbringing.

      That's my best memory of a quote from that Nick Hornby book I was reading a few months ago. I posted it here, somewhere... anyway, it's not like me to skip stuff. It's not like me to be late. It's not like me to be unreliable. However, lately, I have been. Right now I'm supposed to be at a volunteer orientation. Couldn't get there in time due to traffic, rain, etc, so I came on home and I hope they let me reschedule. Unless they decide they don't want unreliable volunteers.

      It's common for me to be in my room, door shut, and Kara to be in her room, door shut. Often I keep my door open so the kitty can wander freely, but especially at night if it's dark in the living room I'd just as soon shut my door completely. (The cat will scratch at the door and I'll let her in.)   Anyway, Kara came a-knocking last night. I was here at my computer, translating, and wearing a new big sweatshirt and no pants. I think it disturbed her that I was not wearing pants. Later we watched Miss USA, and those women wore less than me with no fuss from her.  What did she want? To tell me about her friend whose parents own a coffee beanery. The friend gave her a scoop, two of which are the "perfect amount" for a cup of coffee. She repeated again -- "and the parents, they own the coffee beanery. Can I put it in the coffee?" Yes, Kara. You don't have to ask. Maybe she was all nervous about me not wearing pants.

      I just remembered this. In my philosophy class this afternoon, the professor took a three-minute diversion to address the importance of underlining titles of books we mention in our papers. Yes. No, she was not being philosophical about why we do this or what a title means -- she was just treating us like second-graders.

      Alex is not only letting me make up the test I skipped Friday, he's happy to do so... here's the rundown:  A: "Jessica, when might you take your test?" J: "If you'll let me..." A: "LET you! Yes!"  we make plans  A: "How are you feeling? You do look awful."  Eh. Just to fill in the blanks, he got the idea that I was sick because I told him via email that I wasn't feeling up to coming to class. I did not lie -- I did not feel like coming to class. Never did I say I was sick.  Earlier we were sight reading (reading lines I had not prepared) and he was trying to help me infer the meaning of a word. His hint was, "it's rather like you hair." So I'm guessing and guessing... five guesses later, his answer is "golden."

      Dear Friends,  It has come to my attention that my blog is running thin. Perhaps, dear one, that is because my  life  is running thin. Typically I wake early, do schoolwork, watch some television, and go either to work or to class. Every day.   In the past, I've taken advantage of my insistence that philosophy is very accessible in order to have things to write about. I know that anyone can understand me when I talk about what I'm reading or writing about for class. Although I hold that tenet, I have come to the realization that not everyone cares about such issues. This is a good thing: right now I'm writing about how things can change while remaining the same (for instance, how hot coffee left on the counter will cool). Yeah, it's good people are out there looking for cures for cancer, delivering the mail, making good movies, and so forth.  I'm out. Peace.

      Yesterday I went shopping in Chestnut Hill. It was a really cute high street -- I can see why Hien likes living there, and why Alperson recommended she live there if she didn't want to live in Center City. I went into a candle shop, one of those shops where I just had to buy  something . I sniffed around, and my biggest beef with candles is their scents. I like a quality scented candle, but I also like having multiple candles lit without either overpowering scent or clashing scent. I bought two of these recycled candles -- they look like stacks of candle bottoms. In the store, I couldn't really smell them. Of course, my sniffer was probably out of commission and the rest of the store had a big scent. I've lit them, and they smell. Not bad, not too much, but they have a scent. They're not labeled, so I'm naming it candle smell thirty-four.

         This wise man with his forty thoughts seems to me a fool: but I believe he knows well enough how to sleep.     Happy is he who lives in this wise man's neighbourhood. Such sleep is contagious, even though a thick wall.      A spell dwells even in his chair. And the young men have not sat in vain before the preacher of virtue.      His wisdom is: stay awake in order to sleep well. And truly, if life had no sense and I had to choose nonsense, this would be the most desirable nonsense for me, too.     Now it is clear to me what people were once seeking above all when they sought the teachers of virtue. They sought good sleep and opium virtues to bring it about!     To all of these lauded wise men of the academic chairs, wisdom meant sleep without dreams: they knew no better meaning of life.      And today too there are some like this preacher of virtue, and not always so honourable: but their time is up. And they shall not stand for much longer: already they are lying down.     Blessed are these drowsy men: for they shall soon drop off.   Leave it to Nietzsche to write in tiny paragraphs and read my mind. I wish I felt like posting the preceding parts, but I doubt anyone would feel like reading it. To summarize, the "wise man" Zarathustra encounters sings the praises of sleep and explains how to achieve it by gaining forty thoughts each day: ten laughs, ten truths learned, ten reconciliations, and ten things overcome.

      Yeah, so I've done nothing today ever since I stopped studying Greek around 9:00 this morning.  I napped a little, I've got a pizza in the oven I'll try to eat, and maybe afterwards I'll feel like writing a tiny (miniscule!) Aristotle paper. That would really make my day. That might make today the perfect day.

      Yeah, I stayed at work way to long yesterday. In case I didn't mention beforehand (too lazy to check), I worked for six hours. That's too long for what I do. Then it was payday, and I had stand around at customer service to pick up my check. For some reason, there were 20 hours that showed up unexpected. This more than doubles my paycheck. I'm not complaining, and I'm not asking questions. Just taking what I'm given.  Okay, so my point. I went to the bank, which is on the other side of my house from my store, and eventually got home at ten of eight. I watched television and played a little IM until ER went off -- most of that time I was lying on the floor or on the couch -- and promptly went to bed.   Six hours later, I'm awake. Six and a half hours later, I'm out of bed. Seven hours later, I'm updating my stupid blog with vanities.

      I freaked out today in my checkstand. I thought I lost my keys, imagined myself unable to call Kara because her number is long distance and she'd be at work anyway. I kept checking to see if my car was there. It was, so I imagined that whoever stole my keys couldn't drive a stick. In the end, my keys were under the trash can liner. How'd they get there? I guess they fell out of my pocket while I was standing over the girl emptying the cans. I was relieved like no other, even though beforehand I was imagining myself remaining calm and handing the situation well.

      I slept through the night. I feel pretty good. Actually a little groggy.  I had some weird dreams; I don't remember about what precisely.  Today I've got to get cracking with the studying. Needless to say, I didn't get much of that done yesterday. One thing: they'll turn off my electricity today. Twice, morning and afternoon. I'm not excited about this, and I wish they would explain the "emergency maintenance" that requires them shutting off our electricity or water so frequently. Or is this just me? I don't think it's normal.

      I feel just like a man without a single place to go of interest. I'm further north than south; if I could shut my mouth she'd probably like it.   That's Ryan Adams. Sometimes I hear a line I really like. Sometimes I'm listening to it as I type. I heard some Counting Crows I really liked, but I was doing the dishes at the time and so didn't type those for you.  I'm working on a plan for Friday. Alex is out of town, but we still have to come and take a quiz. This isn't really fair, especially since I don't like quizzes and am tired of taking them. Anyway, what necessitates the plan? Bradley is giving it to us. I don't really want to deal with that. Him. Whatever.

      So I got home around 5:30, ate a little, opened a package from my father (a big big hoodie, a car key, a ten-page handwritten letter, my car tag sticker, and a book about Greek) then was in bed at 6:00. I slept until 7:20, at which time I was sure it was Thursday morning. Now I have to relive, or actually just first live, Wednesday night. Funny thing is, Kara's been asleep for the past three hours with no sign of waking up or caring  what  day it is. Oh, to be her.

      So, I woke up in the middle of my night (the end of most people's evenings) and kicked up the computer to do a little Greek. Who did I find? ... well, better than being asleep. Which is next on the agenda.  Z: but, i should be trying to sleep now Z: so i'm gonna make a go J: you ought to, I should be finishing these lines and doing the same Z: and you shoulda been asleep hours ago J: I was asleep hours ago, thank you. Z: well, if you do lines at 2:15, i'd guess you'll be up til 7am  I love this, but somehow it worries me because I'm not sure how much of it is a joke.

      So, trying to run in three directions at once isn't going so well for me. Everything seems important, and I, unfortunately, am completely unable to prioritize. Whatever is ready-to-hand is what I do. Never do I even bother to think about what is most important, except when I told my supervisor at work I would not be willing to stay late; I needed to go home and study.  Here's the rundown:   ever since this weekend I've been slipping in my Homer translations. We have a quiz Friday. I'm not quite ready for tomorrow's class, but I've done a good bit, and chances are we'll get just about as far as I've gotten. This means I must both finish translating and study on Thursday.  That's not too far from normal. Additionally, tomorrow I'm meeting with a philosophy prof to talk about Greek and my "specialization." Probably we should also talk about my paper for her class, which means that I should act like I have an idea of what I'm going to write about.   Additionally, I've gotten together with Phil to petition the department to LET me use Greek as my language. So I have to write that up, which would be easy enough except that it requires me to a) decide and b) publicly declare my intentions regarding specialization, dissertation research, etc other scary things.  Finally, I just got from Joan the History Prelim study guide, which is lots and lots of questions I can't answer. But that is on the back burner, right with things like doctor checkups and asking about money.

      I'm really happy. I've had some good conversations lately, and I'm beginning to get comfortable here. Actually, it's kind of like Hanover. I hated it there my first year, and actually spent most of May asleep just to avoid the scene. Then it got better, I studied off campus each year for the next three years, and now I'm really glad I had all those experiences.  So yeah, Philly has taken some getting used to, but I'm finding my place here and starting to be okay with it.  I'm actually excited about tomorrow. I've had no personal conversations with professors as of yet this term, excepting one day with Alex, and tomorrow I have a couple of meetings. When I asked my philosophy prof to meet with me yesterday, she seemed excited. Actually, she said she's seen enough undergraduates and would love to talk to me. That's understandable; Frances and I were talking about that this weekend, with Lori -- that, yeah, we were just undergrads and the set up of our classes shouldn't bother us, but our experiences as undergrads was much better. At least we get enough attention from our profs.

      I just emailed a couple of bigwigs. I can't imagine what it would be like to actually track them down, or to phone them, or whatever else people did before the advent of electronic communication.  What's this all about? Language requirement! I mentioned that Phil and I spoke Saturday night. He asked me about Greek. I gave him the scoop. He shares my disdain of the Classics department. He failed his Latin exam the first time he took it because they gave him too much to translate. He's encouraging me to go ahead and try the Greek test at the end of this semester to get it out of the way and do it while the stuff is still "fresh." He couldn't understand why studying Homer wouldn't help me entirely with Aristotle. It's not one or the other, completely, but it's NOT both.  So, I've written to my graduate director to find out how to waive the usual requirement for German or French and to the chair of the classics department. And on Wednesday I hope to speak to the ancient person in our department now just to check in and get advice. Phil all but insisted that I specialize in ancient, asking what else I would do -- early modern?? Why did he suggest that? He said it's a problem that I don't know. He also said that it is okay if I take classes without any direct interest in them for one more year, just like he did when he took social and political philosophy, out of which came a paper he's taken to two conferences and several people have encouraged him to publish. I patted his back after he told me that, but I don't think he got it.  One more thing -- he said he wanted to my bookends. I didn't know what bookends are, or why I need them, until he explained it and volunteered to be mine. That means that I'll call him to get a pep talk before talking to these advisors and bigwigs, and then I'll call him again after to run through it. He's a tad condescending.

      Exhausted.  I have done nothing all day. Sure, I went to work. Sure, I held books. The best thing I did was to call my grandmother. We talked for an hour. Sounds like everyone is having babies. At least I don't have to, now.   I got a lecture on Yankees from my grandmother. She's genuinely interested in the life of the "other half." Makes me crack up. It's crazy, because you know that Yankees are just as fascinated with Southerners, except the Southerners present themselves well in literature and then get made into a mockery in movies.

      Yesterday was a monster day. I'm still feeling it, right in my chest.  I had to call Lara (hi!) over my break to tell her I didn't get off for the day I requested off. Grr. Honestly, I didn't do it "in time" but all of 12 hours late. No slack! We'll go to the Italian Market two weeks from yesterday now, one way or another.  I took the train down to the city and walked to Z's place, which was not a bad walk at all. We went to a Chinese place in, yeah, Chinatown, called Kingdom of Vegetarians. Everything was vegetarian but it has meat names. Strange, funny, but very good. We got some spinach dumplings, which we tried to eat with chopsticks, then requested forks so we could actually EAT. We also got eggplant in garlic sauce and Tai Chi Chicken. Pretty good.  After going out with him, I was supposed to meet some philosophy friends at Patou, some swanky French restaurant in Old City, to hear our professors play jazz. Cool, huh? Actually, they were pretty good. I had fun talking to a few people around me, namely Frances and Matt's wife Lori and Phil. Phil caused a bit of a problem. He was talking to me and I missed the last train. My stomach sank when I realized I could never get to the station in time. I could take a cab up to my place for about $35 but I didn't really want to do that. Duh!  I called Kara, who was sleeping, and came and got me from Frances' apartment building. I'm so glad she did that. I owe her big. Frances said I owe her a milkshake. That sounds pretty good.

      One last update. I've decided to wear my khaki pants all day. I get off work at 4:30. I see no need to rush to the 5:05 train. So I'll take my time and go on the 5:35.   I just blowdried my hair and I think it's going to be okay.  I need to eat something. I've eaten my two favorite foods, of late, for breakfast: pop tarts and pears. I think it's going to be rice and peas for lunch.

      Today is going to be really exciting. Still, I'm nervous about it. I told Kara, and she didn't care what I was doing, she just offered me a Xanax. No, I didn't take it.   Mostly I need to decide what I'm going to wear. Back-to-back I'm going to work, hanging out with a new friend in Center City, and going to a fancy French restaurant to watch a jazz band play with a bunch of philosophers. I can come home for about 7-10 minutes between work and heading to the train to get downtown. Even so, I don't want to dress up too much for my friend. I don't want to stand out as underdressed at the jazz band. I WILL NOT take extra clothes to change in between. I need to wear comfortable shoes.   I'm still trying to decide. Khakis seem too casual if I could wear some nice jeans instead. We'll see. I'll let y'all know.

      Yeah, so I have no life and am at home reading and cleaning tonight. Get over it. But here's the good news -- my backpack broke on Monday; two of the zippers no longer work, so it doesn't hold anything. I went to Target to get a new bag. This time it's just a canvas tote. Try to break that!  So what's the good news about a broken backpack? The old one had been sitting on the floor in my room since Monday, and tonight I was cleaning, so I took everything out of it and found an almond Snickers bar! I bought it on Monday and never ate it and forgot about it. Yes, that made me feel better. No, I'm not eating it now. Maybe I should get out more often.

      I hate today. I went to get my hair trimmed and the woman botched it. I've been crying for an hour and I'm not ready to stop yet. The best part was her yelling at me, scissors flailing inches from my face, that this could in no way be her fault.

      I picked up my paychecks yesterday -- I had accumulated three of them for working there a month. Well, I didn't get paid as much as I thought I would. Guess why? Union dues! I had no choice but to join this stupid union, and they keep 17.50 each week.   Anyway, it's still money, and I am not in it for the money -- I'm in it for the joy of working with the public. Seriously, that's not a joke. I enjoy going to work. I say that because today is my day off!   Boy is it my day off. No plans -- yes, no plans is a change of plans. Saturday is my busy day, and things scheduled for today are rescheduled for tomorrow, with the exception of class and laundry. On that note, I best get on with my translation and prepare for an exciting day of Homer! (not Simpson.)

       I'm not pranking this year, but I'd like to share my favorite pranks of years past.   Removing pillows from beds.  Resetting alarm clocks an hour earlier.  Shoe garland in the bathroom.  Classic: short sheeting beds.   My un-favorite pranks:   Stealing anything and freezing it.  Putting Alphie in the kitchen with a cake-trail.  Disconnecting car parts.

      I'm reading Nick Hornby's "How To Be Good." Man, it's great. Man, he is great. Highly recommended for a good laugh.   "Oh, and we're sort of writing a book." "A book." "Yes. 'How to Be Good,' we're going to call it. It's about how we should all live our lives. You know, suggestions. Like taking in the homeless, and giving away your money, and what to do about things like property ownership and, I don't know, the Third World and so on." "So this book's aimed at high-ranking members of the IMF?" "No, no, it's for people like you and me. Because we get confused, don't we?" "A book telling us what to think about everything? I'd buy it." "I'd give you a copy." ...  No doubt the book will tell us how to feed a family of four on organic meat when we have given away most of our income.    By the way, the book's title is from this fictional book this character is plotting to write. Actually, the novel is about a woman whose husband goes from being the "Angriest Man in Holloway" to a "change the world" fanatic. He gives his kid's computer to a battered woman's shelter, he gives away the family food on the streets, and so on. His wife and kids are surely put to the side. I'm not finished just yet, but it's great.

      I have a cold. I'm gonna cough all over everyone's food. That is, I will  if  I'm a checker. I tend to get moved around a lot.   A word of advice: never trust that your food is clean. It's not unlikely that a hundred people have touched it before you bring it home. I'd guess that at least 20 people have touched every item, and I'm sure there's more that I'm not remembering.  Here's another observation. Some people are good customers and probably never have trouble. Some people are bad customers and probably always have trouble. They figure the world is just a bad place. Yeah. I can have two different customers come up with similar problems, and one will allow me to fix it without complaining and one will throw a fit. It's all in their attitude. I'm not allowed to tell the customers to chill out.  Since moving over to the desk, people are throwing stuff at me, yelling at me, and talking about me as if I can't hear them. This is draining.

      Yeah, so you meet a lot of interesting people in the grocery store, no matter why you are there. Yesterday, like all Saturdays, was especially interesting.  I was working the service desk, helping this woman and her two daughters. Someone else hopped on their case, but I just stood around to observe (I'm still learning the ropes). Down the counter a man was be-bopping to himself and these little girls were laughing at him. Their mother told them not to let him hear them laugh. Her concern was not with their laughing, but with his overhearing it.   I go down to help him, and he's looking at cameras. I help him as I can, and he's evidently chemically altered. He's decided he wants a money order for $113. I decide I need to see the cash before I sell it to him, but my colleague starts to print it. Well, I sell him the money order and some stamps. He does have cash. He tells me as he's laying it down (something like $121) that he won't be able to get high tonight.  Finally, I hand him the money order and stamps, and he wants to know how many stamps to put on the money order. There's no right answer to that question.  I'll leave you with a little line from my new theme-poem, "Supermarket in California" by  urlLink Ginsberg  -- "In my hungry fatigue, and shopping for images, I went into the neon fruit supermarket..." Check it out -- it tells of such hallucinations, as one is apt to have in such an establishment.

      Daddy's gone. I really enjoyed having him around. No posts yesterday -- the computer was on the floor most of the day, minus a little directions and weather checking before breakfast. Feels kind of good! I mean, being computer-free feels kind of good. The weather is a bit chilly. My father said that it feels like an early December chill in the shade.  Ha!  First, the news: he popped my roof up, so when he gets back to Memphis he'll have a friend do a slap-job of a glass replacement and collect money as the car was totaled. He's friends with all kinds of people who do stuff like that, as well as with our insurance adjuster, so he can work some magic I can't. We taped up the back with some Arkansas chrome and a dropcloth. Still, I really feel for him driving that little thing 1080 miles, though.   We saw the Phillies play last night, and they won in extra innings! Well, an extra inning. We sat up very high above first base into right field. Most of my favorite players were playing. All in all, a good night. He'd never ridden the subway before, anywhere, and had to talk to everyone he saw. Oh well.  I'm having a time with the new car -- it's huge, I'm bumping stuff, scaring my father, you name it. I'll get used to it. Actually, in some ways, it's nicer than my other one, as much as I loved it. Just bigger.  Don't really know what I'm going to do now, but something. Peace.

      I ran a few errands this morning and then returned the car. I kind of liked driving it, in the end. It's just kind of weird to be in the renting office, and here's why:  You may know that Enterprise is a top place for recent grads to get on a good career path in business. They promote from within, so everyone in the corporation starts out renting cars to people like me. The managers in this office are all guys around my age, probably up to but not older than 26. Three of them.  Odd thing numero uno: I'm filling out some papers when I first get the car, Monday. The guy is just watching me write, then the phone rings, and he answers it. I finish while he's on the phone (two separate calls, I'd guess). Then he apologizes for making me wait and explains that it's always busy. As if this surprises him. Has he never had a job before? I'm guessing that's a real possibility. In a good business, it's a good thing to have plenty of people calling and people waiting in the office. I guess he didn't learn that in business school.  Odd thing nummer twee: I walk in today to return the car. The guy at the counter (different guy) says, "what can I help you with, young lady?" I laugh and say, "you did not just call me young lady." Man -- man.   The thing is, these guys are acting like they own the place and there are plenty of other people who work there. There are drivers who picked me up and brought me back, people to clean the cars, other office staff, and these kids are on powertrips! The guy who originally rented me the car asks me how it was (what should I say? that everyone's car should get smashed so they could have the joy of renting from you?). But he called me as I like to be addressed: Ms Marler. I'm serious. I like that.

      I couldn't let a day go by without a post. Almost made it -- alas, no. I started to write earlier and spared you my ramblings.  I went to the grocery this morning to pick up some stuff so my father doesn't get the idea that I don't eat. He'll be here tomorrow night. I went to the ATM and there were several police in the parking lot (large lot of a shopping center). One officer was walking around with a gun the size of my leg! I can't imagine what would call for that.   I don't feel like posting anymore.  Working at the grocery at night is boring.  Having to change plans all the time is awful.  I'm so glad Fantasia won the American Idol.  Kudos to anyone who can identify the lyric from the title.

      My interview went pretty well. The first guy (sales manager) wrote on my application: great person, would do a good job. I'm hired. Anybody want to help me straighten out my life? Somehow I implied to them that I'm quitting the grocery. Also, I told the guy at the deli I'd work for him. Too many jobs!  In other news, I have the best father in the world. If you think yours can compete, bring it on. My daddy is taking four days off work to bring me his wife's car. Bam!  I'm taking him to the Phillies game Friday night, against the Braves. I'll have to tell him not to wear anything that says Braves on it!

This afternoon I have a job interview at a major retail store. I hope I get the job, because this coffee job is looking worse and worse. I talked to the guy this morning, and, well, I'm not excited about the prospect of working for him.  Right now, I don't feel like doing anything. So I won't.

      That's a drinking party, folks.  Tonight I went to Alex's house, my Greek prof's, for supper. He loaded me up on wine. It was a good night, and the food was incredible. He made eggplant packets (he called them packets -- they had in them mozzarella, tomato, pepper, and basil; he named all the ingredients in his native British accent and his cool American accent). The main course was lasagna, which he made vegetarian (I ate the lone piece of veggie) and meat; also, a cold pasta salad (with and without meat); finally, a yummy Gorganzola and lettuce salad with artichoke. Fantastic supper.  I was the youngest person there by about fifteen years. Actually, Alex is 11.9 years older than I am. However, in contrast to my philo party last Friday, these people were more honest about how much they knew at my age than are those in my current position (plus two or three years). I am very glad I went.   In other news, I have a rental car: a red Kia Rio. This is like Steph's car. It's a little jerky to drive, especially up hills. I always want to drop a gear, and it refuses. This brings to mind a story, with which I shall conclude, combining a professor's house (Cosans), Steph's Rio and it's awful ride, and drinking to excess. I was awfully sick one night coming home from the Broadway. I blame Steph's driving. At any rate, I finally ask her to pull over for a puke break. Right in Cosans' front yard. Oh, how I treasure that moment.

      Just got back from the body shop. I spent most of the morning sweeping glass out of my car (and slicing up my fingers).  First thing this morning, I called the apartment management. The woman who answered the phone sent me to another woman, to another, and then the third person informed me that I just need to wait for their insurance people to contact me. I don't forsee this happening -- I don't know that they have my phone number. Which I guess means wait for the mail? This woman wasn't very nice to me -- each of the three made it clear they didn't care about me and said, delightfully, that they didn't know about the tree mess until this morning. Thanks, ladies.  I have been on and off the phone with my parents, who don't seem to understand the extent of the damage. My father just wants me to pop the roof up. I called around and got my mechanic to refer me to a body shop. I called the body shop, and I expressed my concern about driving my car to the man on the phone. He said bring it on in. I do, and as I'm walking in, he and some other woman start blasting me with questions and tell me straight out there's nothing I can do and I shouldn't be driving it.   Then (this is great) they tell me to stop crying because it's just a car. It's not the car, I tell them, it's that I know no one else around me. I have no way to get to work, I have no family within a thousand miles, and everyone is telling me what to do and I can't do it all. She directs me to the tissues. I sit in their lobby and call my father, who I can't hear because he's in Podunk, Mississippi, and then I end up driving home.

      You may remember my story of letting that woman come in to use my phone. I have stock stories, and that's one of them, it's likely I posted it. So I resolved not to open my door again. This morning there was a knocking, and I thought about opening it but I was not wearing pants.  It was a police officer. He tells me a tree fell on my car. I go out to look at it. Yikes, I can hardly see my car for all the leaves and branches. Basically this sucks. I have no way to get anywhere, I'll have to walk to the ghetto grocery store (I am almost out of food), and I had to call in to work today.   I really don't know what to do now. Just wait on some news and check on what I can check on.

      NB: I am not claiming to make up this advice. I just want to share with you the advice I'm taking to heart right now. Joan has the skulls of plagiarizers in her office, and I don't want to join them!   Do your work well, but always leave something undone. That way you will be indispensable.    With that said, I am going to work. I'm going to check and see if I've told my Saturday afternoon at the store stories, and, if not, look forward to those later. Saturday is the only days the crazies come out.

      Last night I felt very young; it was kind of like the first Thanksgiving a kid tries to sit at the adult table. At the same time, I feel as if I must be fundamentally different from the people I was spending time with. Because I never want to "grow up" and be like them.  Oddly enough, it's good that I didn't leave when I was having a bad time -- I had a better time when these other people left! Stick it out, folks, that's my advice for the day.  I had some other advice for the day, too, but I forgot it.

      Just got back from the exam. Wow, what a way to start the day! It was humbling. Still, I might have passed. The man who gave it to me (I'd not had class with him, so whatever he said was on my reputation) said he's sure I did fine. I'll know next week whether I passed.  First I had a passage from the Symposium. No dictionary. Actually, it wasn't that bad, although I didn't quite finish. Next was a long passage from the Republic, for which I could use a dictionary. Not that it helped. That one was tough, and looking up words was pretty time consuming. Two and a half hours later, I'm drained. Really, though, it wasn't bad, even though I didn't breeze through it -- kind of a let down when I figure I'd been preparing for it for three years.   Again, like most things (the jobs, etc): I don't mind failing, but I dread the act of learning I fail.

      So not a lot of posts today. Maybe it's the new format that makes me prefer one substantial post each evening? I don't know.  So have I been studying like crazy? No. I don't know what I've been doing. I have been chatting online a lot lately, mostly with Z and Jessie, and today a special appearance from Lara. :) I made banana bread. I can't cook here. Might be the electric oven?  I haven't not studied. I reviewed some stuff. I finished the book I'd been reading, an autobiography of one of my profs. It ended up feeling kind of voyeuristic -- and kind of wrong. I know he published it, but it's so personal, and while through the first few chapters I couldn't imagine anyone reading it who didn't know him, in the end I felt bad for gaining such insight into him through a book. Also, some of the issues he took up hit pretty close to home.  Because I'm returning his book to the library tomorrow, I'll post a few quotes I want to keep in mind. I'm not attributing them for my silly paranoia of someone searching for his name (he does have quite a reputation!) and ending up on this page. See now why I feel so naughty reading his thoughts?    "You become a helpless victim of forces more powerful than your best intentions."  "It is ironic how men and women who contributed towards your becoming what you are leave you alone when their work is done. You go ahead, carrying their memories. You imagine, in fantasy, that they are there watching you."  "The philosopher is still a concrete human being: however far-flung and cosmic his thinking may be; the thinker is still an embodied, historically situated, biologically constituted, socially rooted, linguistically localized and culturally conditioned creature. It is a miracle that he can use thee constraints to open out, in his thoughts, to the world at large."

      Anybody think it's odd that I'm posting less now that school is out? I ought to have oodles of time, right? I ought to be filling my little mind with oodles of interesting thoughts, right? I don't know what's up. Mostly I just waste time these days.  Sold lottery tickets today. It's funny to think people would go to the grocery store to buy lottery tickets. I don't really understand how they work, which isn't good. Of course, I've heard of Powerball, but I don't know about the other stuff. Evidently you just choose three numbers, or four, depending on the game, and that's it. I typed in some of the digits wrong because the keypad is upside down from the register (think telephone vs. calculator). So the guy wanted to buy the wrong numbers I typed in case I picked the winner! Crazy superstition.  Tomorrow is study day for the Greek exam, which I'll take Friday morning. Didn't realize when I scheduled it that I probably made it too early. I'll have to leave at 9:20, which is just about when I've been waking up now that I work nights. I'm a little nervous; besides reading dialogues in translation and studying a little (very little!) vocab, I've not studied much. Don't really know whether I will. Mostly I just imagine myself passing. I just remind myself there will never be a better time, unless that time is never. Maybe look forward to lots of posts tomorrow!

      Back in the days when I talked to Dave and was looking for a job, he said you have to know someone to get a job. He has a good one. I didn't get one (knowing him doesn't help -- I guess you have to know the  right  person).  Another sure-fire way to get a job? Have a job. So I've been putting in applications for months. Yesterday I got "hired" in that shady operation. Today I get a phone call to come in for an interview some place else and the opportunity to go full time at my present job. If only that new offer wasn't so weird, I'd feel more comfortable passing up these other options...

      Amazing, absolutely amazing.  I had decided to apply to work at this deli place in an office building near me, so I went in this morning around 9:30 to avoid the lunch crowd. The guy (owner) was a little weird, saying I should come back this afternoon. What was weird was that he kept looking over his shoulder and saying "I can't talk now." He said he wanted someone to "help grow this small business." Hmm...  So, I returned, per his request, filled out a scant application, and then he talked to me. Didn't ask me any questions except for me to agree to do what he wants. Here's the scoop: he is opening a coffee bar in another location in the office building and wants me to run it. Another weird statement he made to me: "You've probably heard this before, but it will be kind of like your own business within my business." No, haven't heard that before! Anyway, he said he's interested in me.   Things get better. Went into the store tonight and the store director moved me to the desk! At least at night (when I'll be working) this is easier than being a clerk. Plus it shows that he appreciates me. Glad someone does!

      Sunday. I did what any person in my position would do: buy books. I'm nearly jobless, all I do is read (when I'm not watching baseball), and I have shelves of philosophy books to read in preparation for my prelim. So I go out and buy more books.  I know one girl who really likes Emerson, so I picked up a cheap volume of selections from his essays and poems. I'd been wandering around the bookstore for about an hour, looking for a few different things, and I am headed to the checkout. I pass a display and the book Baseball and Philosophy catches my eye. I'm familiar with the Popular Culture and Philosophy series (Seinfeld, Simpsons, etc.) though I'd never read any of them. So of course, I pick up this book and head straight to the checkout without even opening it.  The cashier evaluates my selections and comments on my last name. Grr.   I've been reading it, and some of the issues are really a stretch. It's kind of like an introduction to philosophy through baseball metaphors and analogies. I might return it. Even so, I still kind of want it, so if you'd like to send a little money my way (we could all pitch in fifty cents), I'd appreciate it.

      You might be tempted to idealize solitude, like my colleague Lucy, who says that to think about what she will do with her life she must light candles and go up on a mountaintop. Will she carry the candles, or leave them behind? Surely she said light candles and then ascend the mountain! I imagine her as St. Lucia, in a white robe, walking up a snow capped mountain wearing a garland of ivy and daisies. The flame is not affected by her wind nor the increasing altitude, just as her bare feet are not affected by the thick snow. Upon reaching the summit, she raises her arms and embraces a silver-lined vision of what her life will bring. Invariably, she finds herself rich and slightly angry.  Welcome to my mountaintop, right here in my apartment. I'm experiencing solitude of the kind I count days in double digits until I will see someone I know apart from the grocery. Yet, I can hear my upstairs neighbors as if they are in the room with me. For the first time in my life, living here with the windows open, I am reminded that I live along a busy street in a large city. My only friend has made it clear that solitude should be embraced, not shunned, meaning his company will not be meaningless filler for my summer. And then there is the cat, who never seems to want to be around me when I'm willing to pet her, but will instead play with my toes while I am typing or sniff around my supper plate.   So, in the immortal words of Michael Jackson, "You are not alone." The kids are wrestling upstairs.

      What an exciting day -- it's a beautiful Saturday here, just cool enough to enjoy the sunshine in the mornings. I heard about the Glenside Farmers Market and was excited to go and get some local fruits and veggies. Also, according to their flyer, there is a giant orange llama!   So I just got back. There were all of seven vendors, only one of which was selling produce. They only had a small variety of greens. The others sold plants (flowers, little trees, the like) and the remaining vendors sold baked goods or jewelry or soap. Some farmers they are!  And the llama? Was a little bit big, about as tall as me, made of plyboard. Yes, just a two-dimensional cutout. There's not a thing wrong with that in itself, but it's not a draw, if you know what I mean.

      So much for solitude. I have an interview tomorrow for a full-time summer job!   That's not precisely true. First of all, I haven't gotten the job yet. Let me know if you'd like to be a reference for me. Secondly, even if hired, the position begins June 21 (I'm assuming training will take place earlier; still, that leaves time for solitude).   In other news, I have no plans, indefinitely, excepting 21 May.

      I said this morning at 9:30 to Kara, "it's 9:30 on the first day of summer, and I'm already bored." She asked how I could be bored when there's television. So I watched Laverne and Shirley and now I'm bored and tired of television.  Kara's been gone for 20 minutes and I am already lonely. She took her stuff and now the place is empty.  Back to Plato; I'll let the philosophers keep me company. I might ruin my eyesight this summer. It's too hot for lights or to open the blinds.

      My favorite part of going out with Kara is people saying we look alike. Because it's not true. So know that if you say that to us, we will laugh about it later and not take seriously anything you say.   One guy last night -- we went to a party of the pharmacy students -- said we look alike because we have the same hair, same smile. Never heard the smile thing before, but we neither have the same hair nor the same smile.  We didn't have a lot of fun, but I'm glad I didn't send her alone. I talked to a few people, we enjoyed the ride there and back together (her friend's house is too far away!) and then tried to go to Applebee's (it was closed) and ended up at IHOP (it was a disaster, but not the worst trip I've made to such an establishment).  Back to Plato.

      O Solitude! Solitude, my  home ! I have lived too long wildly in wild strange lands to come home to you without tears!  Now shake your finger at me as mothers do, now smile at me as mothers smile, now say merely: "And who was it that once stormed away from me like a storm-wind? --   "who departing cried: I have sat too long with Solitude, I have unlearned how to be silent! You have surely learned  that  -- now? ... "But here you are at your own hearth and home; here you can utter everything and pour out every reason, nothing is here ashamed of hidden, hardened feelings."

      Yes sir, I am done. Papers are in, exams are taken, now it's just me and two preliminary exams.   I read a passage while passing time for my bus this afternoon, I will post part of it shortly, but now I'm just announcing that I'm done. Called my daddy to tell him; he says he's lost in the woods. I love calling him, because whatever he is doing is precisely what I am not doing. Congratulated Z, now announcing the good news to whoever still reads this.

      If your name is not Zeno, Socrates, or Parmenides, I apologize for not thinking about you lately.  I'll diversify my thoughts, right here, as if on command. Alphabetically.  Alex: Please email me with the details of our dinner party. You won't have any guests if the invitation is last-minute.  Future Boss: Please hire me. Really.  Graduate Committee: Please fund me. Really.  Z: Please call me. Really.  That's it. That's all I'm thinking about. Really.

      I think I'm writing the best paper of my life. For only the second time or so, I think I've got something wholly original to say. (No, I'm not giving away secrets here. Yes, you're welcome for me sparing you the boredom.) The problem is that I'm having trouble finding my voice. It's a challenge, writing this out, but it is enjoyable. I guess. That's what I say because I'm not done yet and it's not due tomorrow.

      Ahh, the philosophical dilemma of ages: can we trust our bodies? are our bodies something to be ashamed of? is our mind, soul, or rational principle better than our physicality? are the things we know through psychologically better than those we know corporeally?   All those familiar questions, and here is favorite passage, newly discovered:  "do not let habit, borne of much experience, force you down this way, by making you use an aimless eye or an ear or tongue full of meaningless sound" (Parmenides)  He's not dismissing the body, he's not encouraging us to overcome it and rid ourselves of it; he's warning us that it can concern us with trivial things. That's my spin, probably because it's what I already think and now I'm choosing a passage to back me up.  Ahh, the philosopher's way.

      Just got back from the pet store, which is hiring. The last job I got happened in the same way -- Kara and I were at the grocery, she kinds of jokes upon seeing the sign, "you should apply!" Precisely what she said today at the Pet Valu. Unfortunately, I don't meet the criteria: I can't lift 55 lbs. In honor of Mother's Day, I'll share my grandmother's favorite piece of advice: "If you pick up your pig every day, you can still pick him up when he's 200 pounds. But you have to do it every day." Ahh, words to live by.  In other news, I'm having a happy day. :)

      Think about it. In December, the weather was dreary, my room was warm, there was something almost romantic about sitting before my computer and writing papers about lovely topics in Aesthetics and Jurisprudence while sipping hot tea and wearing cuddly houseshoes. Plus, I had the incentive of going to Memphis immediately following.  Now, it's warm outside, cold inside, the kids are having some sort of Lord of the Flies-esque chanting gathering outside my window, complete with sticks and conch shells. Me, once I finish, I'll have nothing to do but look for jobs and work at the grocery. My reading of Parmenides is alternately indiscernible and pretentious. I keep reading and making notes in hopes that something will strike me; I open blank Word documents and write nothing in them.  I guess part of it too is that this professor seems to dislike my writing. Last term, I only got feedback from one professor mid-semester. He said I wasn't confident enough, but that I was elegant and that  he likes the way I think . Remember how that made me glow? Still does. :) This woman now has told me that my grammar is too complex to convey my meaning. Furthermore, I have no point and sometimes even get the facts wrong. Oddly enough, she has said all this, with no positive comment besides "don't worry about these errors" and given me an A on everything thus far. So why worry? I'm not.

      Oops, a friend of mine just warned against pride. Maybe we mean different things, because I don't mean cocky. I mean I finally, for once this term, did just what I ought to have done, and it's kind of nice. I studied fully for my Greek final. Yes, the final is over only 360 lines, and I reread them all. This ought to give me some sort of leg up tomorrow. I think I deserve to do well, if not for me (I already know what I know), then at least to have transcript-style proof that I didn't waste my time studying this language.

      Yeah, so my professor had been promising to email us his translations of our in-class work for weeks. Seriously, weeks. I figured he forgot my name or something and I missed out on the email. Found out on last class he just hadn't gotten around to it. This doesn't bother me; I might not even look at them. However, this does bother Barb. She suggested he get around to it sooner rather than later. I suppose he intentionally waited to the last minute. Yes, they came at 6:00 this evening. Yes, our exam is at 11:00 tomorrow morning. He included a note, "good luck and don't stay up all night."  The best part -- the file name for the one I do want to check out is "Ody 19 Tranny." I don't know whether "tranny" is British or just him being silly. Perhaps both.

      I love baseball.   How do you keep fish from smelling?  Plug their noses!   I love popsicles.  I wonder what my life will be like this summer.  197 lines to review. Press on.  Now I'm reviewing, here's a story I don't think I posted before: in Greek, one word "diphros" means both chariot and seat. While the other students were laughing about how Penelope ordering her maid to bring in the seat by stripping the chariot of its wheels, etc, I calmly pointed out that the word is practically the same in English: chair and chariot.

      Raise your hand if you're underloading this term and still can't manage to stay on top of your schoolwork.  Seriously, I am enjoying some of the stuff I'm reading for my Parmenides paper. Plus, I've convinced myself it's worthwhile for me to read whatever interests me in the moment as long I read it attentively and perhaps draw a paper from it. That's part of my summer project, in my overactive imagination: write papers, send them off to present, maybe publish something... even I am saying, "yeah, right." But my grocery store experience won't easily translate into a job for me unless I get on the ball and make my graduate career worthwhile. I'm developing a habit of virtue according to which I do not feel sorry for myself and my situation and pursuing a vision in which I come out the stronger for it. Which is precisely why I'm writing here rather than studying.

      I just took what is, in all honesty, an undeserved study break to apply for jobs. How pathetic. At least something good may come of it... I want a job not just for the money, but also to meet people and have a way to pass time besides stewing in prelim preparations. Kara just got word that she'll get 40 hours a week in and around Harrisburg this summer at various CVS pharmacies. Lucky duck. I'm going to be lonely, come visit me!

      I baked cookies Saturday night. Did I post that? Kara wanted to try one today -- she'd been too afraid because they've got flaxseed in them --, but they're crisp, so she wanted to microwave it. I told her to be careful; she joked that it might catch on fire. The girl put it in for 30 seconds, and, yes, it did catch on fire. The house smells like smoke.

      At least today I can identify their source.   I present for you Item A: cancelled plans with Z over the weekend. The stupid girl in me really wanted to talk to him. The paranoid girl in me thought he was avoiding me. Finally this afternoon I had a shot of courage (or desperation) and made contact, and I really enjoyed talking to him. I am back on top of the world.   Item B: Two long shifts over the weekend plus sleeping funny plus excessive typing has left me in tremendous physical pain, mostly in my right shoulder and left knee. Right now I ache... I can't handle the boxes of kitty litter or five-gallon water dispensers! I'm a weakling. Summer always makes me feel scrawny.  Item C: Giving away free Easter candy at the store. People took more than they should have, so it only lasted 20 minutes or so. I guess the management just wanted to be rid of it and win the hearts of some customers, but their greediness is a serious turnoff to me.  Item D: This final item, along with Item A, are the biggest uppers and downers of my day. Guess who I saw at the store -- believe it -- my last term's Greek prof. The man who could only hope I'd never see him again. He saw me before I saw him, then I hid as best I could. Then I kept looking for him. He had that deer in the headlights look (and yes, he has big brown eyes). However, he avoided me and waited in line at the farthest checkstand from mine. I got the evil eye from my boss (who has big blue eyes,  much  pleasanter) for making customers wait, but there was no way I was going to pull him over. How odd that there are 2 people in a city of 5 million I hope never to encounter and they both come to my store during my shift within two days of each other. There better be some good karma hiding out somewhere else.

      I have only one remaining simple pleasure. I need a few more.   I'll paraphrase from  Reality Bites:  When my father found out he had cancer, he brought me out here and gave me this shell. He said, "Son, all the answers are in here." I realized the shell was empty; this is all meaningless. There's no point to any of this. It's all just a... a random lottery of meaningless tragedy and a series of near escapes.  So I take pleasure in the details. You know, a Quarter-Pounder with cheese, those are good, the sky about ten minutes before it starts to rain, the moment where your laughter becomes a cackle. And I sit back and I smoke my Camel Straights, and I ride my own melt.    I guess I could add watching and quoting from that movie as another simple pleasure. And Diet Coke over ice. Burning candles in the dark, working at my computer with Athena sleeping on my bed. I guess I could enjoy other things, I just have to get out and do them.

       Do I have a Southern last name?   I was looking to see if a friend is listed in the phone book -- usually after having a home phone nearly a year, you'll be in there -- and decided to see if there happens to be anyone with my last name in Philly. Nope. (I won't be listed as I don't have a landline.)   How about in all of PA? There are 12 occurrences. In Tennessee, 142. In Texas, 161. In Vermont, 3.  My grandmother's last name: 0 in PA. 117 in Mississippi. In Tennessee, 87.  Kind of interesting, unless it speaks to inbreeding. Wait -- that's Kentucky.

      I don't always make good eye contact with the customers at the store. It's a little different when there's a large order, but today I was in the express line and, of course, usually only looked at the customers when I handed them receipts. That was the case today, and when I looked up at a certain customer, it was a person I'd met once in my life and hoped never to see again. The first week of school there was a philosophy department gathering, which really freaked me out, because I talked to this creep. Turns out he never comes to anything, and so from the first week of class to the last week of class I never saw him. Until tonight -- he's in my line. Luckily he didn't seem to remember me, but just seeing him again made me feel terrible. Good thing he talked about my "life is terrific" badge to make me remember that I'm paid the big bucks to keep my personal feelings to myself.

      I need to stop proclaiming my disdain at people who don't thank me. My boss did thank me today. He's not such a bad guy; it's just kind of weird that he's so friendly to most everyone (and the baggers really like him) but to me he's always aloof. I guess it's because he's my age and he's more comfortable being in charge of the kids. Oh well.  Today was like sanatorium break out day or something. Several of the customers were not all there, but only one was belligerent (not in my line). The biggest problem in my line, which was quickly handled, was one man who bought all kinds of food, then hands me a belt bag full of pennies (probably $3 or so) and says I can keep the bag. Had to get the guard to take his food away from him and help him out the door.  So I came home and ate and ate and ate. Now I need a nap before starting studying. Good thing I don't have plans tonight, either, huh? I did have loose "let's go out sometime next weekend" plans for this weekend, but apparently nothing is materializing of that. However, if I happen to get a phone call I'm announcing here and now that it will NOT be me being a pushover to say yes. It will be me being a happy fulfilled person. Not that I'm expecting anything.

      Got a phone call around 9:35. I was excited, imagining who might be calling me. Maybe someone wanted to do something with me today. Sure enough, it was my boss. Can I work today? I said okay. Then I asked when. He said as soon as I could get there. Great. Needless to say, I wasn't showered or breakfasted. But now I am. I feel like a stupid pushover. He didn't even thank me. But that's just him. It's fine.

      I've been reading a lot about body image and popular culture, changing "desirable" body shapes, so forth -- all from the point of view of women.  True, there is a ton of material out there for women discussing women. I, however, am smart enough to realize that this can't just affect women; it's been said that just like girls don't grow up to be Barbie, boys don't grow up to be G. I. Joe. Who knew I had to look to a frivolous website to get the scoop:   Those sleek, slim, and drop-dead gorgeous models that hawk goods on television and in magazine ads have long been blamed for leaving some women with a poor body image. Turns out, women are not alone. New research from the University of Central Florida shows that men harbor those same feelings of inadequacy when they compare themselves to the ideal male body.   Reuters reports that a study of 158 male college students found that those who were made to watch TV ads starring lean, muscular, and often shirtless young men selling deodorant and cologne showed more body dissatisfaction and outright depression compared with their peers who watched "neutral" commercials that featured middle-aged and older men selling cars and telephone plans.  It's long been known that when women have a poor image of their own bodies, they are at a higher risk of suffering from low self-esteem, depression, and unhealthy eating habits. Now study authors Daniel Agliata and Dr. Stacey Tantleff-Dunn say there is ample evidence that more men are feeling dissatisfied with their bodies.   It's tough out there: The idealized male physique is becoming ever more buff, while the typical American man's waistline is expanding ever wider, notes Reuters.   Think you can just shrug it off? You'll have to make a conscious effort to do so since the average person is exposed to nearly 25 appearance-related commercials each day.   The study findings were published in the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology.   urlLink From Netscape

      My neighbors came to alert me that my car was being towed. Of this I am very grateful. What is odd, though, is that the guy doing the towing said he was doing so because of complaints... from neighbors? I don't know.  Here's how it went down. When they told me, I went out to see that yes, my car was on the back of a tow truck. I asked the squirrely little guy towing it how I could get it back (I work this afternoon). He said I could pay there and it would be less than if he took it away.  He said if I got my purse, we'd all go to the ATM together. This guy was trying so hard to take care of me, but he didn't let me off without paying. He tried to make conversation on the ride over to the ATM, then when I tried to get him to give me back the car right there, he said, "get back in the truck. Let's get you out of here."  Now I'm $75 lighter and angrier than ever at my apartment complex. I guess I am glad I got it back -- today would be a bad day to miss work; we're having an important visitor.

      I had a  urlLink Moon Pie  today.  Actually, I'd just been craving one. I stopped for gas and a drink, and -- lo and behold -- there were two boxes of moon pies on the snack shelf. They were dusty, but that didn't turn me off. When I went to pay, the old man was a bit intrigued, but I didn't strike up a conversation.  It was good. I can't believe I only bought one. Maybe I'll find another one someplace else, because I was a far bit from my place (gone to a special mall) when I stopped.

      Grocery stores should be open later.  Even on Sunday -- especially on Sunday.  All the stores around me close in 10 minutes. I am foodless. One more thing to do tomorrow.

      I have yet to leave the house today, apart from several trips to the dumpster. Perhaps I will venture to the grocery store (for food) after Arrested Development.  So what have I done? Thrown away tons of Kara's junk. Bottles of conditioner with two tablespoons of conditioner in them. The box from her DVD player and the plastic that protected her martini set. Gone! And I put the videos in the closet.  People I work with are afraid of my boss. We're still honeymooning. I hope it lasts.  I can't distinguish the wedding march from the graduation song when it's playing faintly from the apartment above mine.  I need to sleep in my own bed tonight and go to the mall tomorrow.

      My first day at work in the market in a very long while. 10 days. I guess that always yields good stories, or at least stories, and I have one. Perhaps you recall James, the unpleasant 8th-year student (now 9th? has he finished?) in my department who freaked me out the first week of class talking to me.    urlLink Item A    urlLink Item B   He appeared again today. In my line. And again had to chat. This time he inquired into my legs -- he referenced his once-upon-a-time retail career, and said he had to get out of that. And that maybe on a bad day my legs are better than his. I was laughing and blushing, thinking to myself that we have the same aspirations (to become philosophy profs). And that out of somatic interests or not, he always manages to talk about my body. Then he insisted that he's not flirting with me. I wonder whether he does this in every line he goes through.

      I may have mentioned that at my new job, whenever the customers get too upset, it's my responsibility to get a manager to talk to them. The idea is that they'll feel better, as if their concern is valid, when I send them up the chain of command. Plus, the managers are all really great salesmen who can be a little more smooth than I can.  What does this mean for me? It's good news; the customers never upset me the way they do at the market. Okay, once or twice so far they have, but it's not the customers upsetting me -- it's me losing faith in the goodness of humanity. I know the customers don't upset me because I talked to a customer today who was being helped by another customer service person. The customer asked, "do you remember me?" I didn't. She apologized for fussing at me the other day. I have a vague recollection of her problem, which a manager solved. It made me feel good that I don't remember her. Kind of weird to get an apology like that. I just told her it's okay, I understand being upset when stuff breaks.

      I really need to learn to relax. Today turned out really well. Really, really well. I didn't want to leave the house -- it's my only day off in sight -- but I need to do laundry. Yeah, I only have one shirt for the grocery, and not only does it need to be washed, it's been in my hamper for the past 8 days, which I've been off.   Backup! Before I did laundry, I mentioned to Lara that I have passes for an advance showing of a movie tonight, but I wasn't sure I'd go. She said she'd come, so we'll enjoy that later tonight. Keep your eyes peeled for Napoleon Dynamite. Amazing to drive from 60 miles away to see a movie! But it is free. :)  Okay, laundry. As I was putting my stuff in the dryer, this woman was emptying her dryer and offered me to use her remaining minutes. Later, elsewhere, I pulled into a meter with 22 minutes on it, which is all that I need.  Laundry being done, it was time to go to the market and have the "talk" with my boss. Turns out, the head boss is on vacation, so I talked with my immediate manager, who doesn't want to lose me. This man wants to work with me, not use me. So things are straightened out for the time being.  I'm out. Weeeeee!

      If you want to talk to my boss for me, volunteer now!  I'm not going to quit my job just yet. I am going to have to miss Saturday, again. But they (whoever the mystery folk are who make the schedule) put me on against my availability.  This past week without working at the market was especially nice. But if I have time to work two jobs this summer (and I do if everyone schedules me according to my availability) I really ought to. Things will be much easier later on.  Oh, in other job-related news, I got a call yesterday to interview for a job I applied for in May. I think I'll have to pass.  So today I'm resting and getting up the nerve to talk to someone about Saturday. Missing work is bad, especially on weekends, but I shouldn't have to go in if they're ignoring my recorded availability. I can't wait until I work regular hours. This is silly.

Now I have a digital camera -- I just need to remember to use it -- so I'm gonna post a couple of photos I took yesterday out with my mother.  We went through Fairmount Park and the Art Musuem. It was closed (Monday), but I still had to show her the impressive building&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     and the view down the Parkway to City Hall.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      I am so tired.  That's okay, it's almost time to go to bed.  My mother is here visiting, and I'm still working full days. Today we woke up and went to Ikea, where she bought me a chair and lamp. Both are really nice (for Ikea) and help make the living room feel more homey. Plus the chair cushion is red and throws some color in what was previously all in "sepia tones". Kara will probably freak. Or not.  Work is going well. I just wish I had a day to spend doing stuff with my mother. I just want to sit at home for a bit and -- I don't know -- enjoy the new chair. Maybe Wednesday.  I don't know what I'm going to do about these two jobs. Not good news, not at all.  Oh, my mother says the cat is fat. She looks like a turkey. We're giving her less food, and she really doesn't seem to mind. So, maybe soon enough I'll have a fit cat. I'll make her play, too... I'll get her in top form.

      Surprise, surprise, I'm sexist.  At school, it's not so much as issue. By now I take it for granted that I will be one of three women in a class of thirty.   At work, things are different. True colors show. I am weak.  One of the warehouse guys, John, assures me that soon enough I'll be throwing 20s on the counter. That means 20-inch television sets! I'd like to see the day.  At the market a few nights ago, one man told me it would be okay to put two 1-gallon jugs of water into a single sack. They fit; however, when I attempted to hand them to him, I couldn't really lift them. He could.  This is something my mother gets upset about -- she doesn't want a weak daughter. And my grandmother says (and I'll say it again) that if you lift a pig every day, you'll still be able to pick him up when he weighs 200 pounds.

      I talked to the boss today. It wasn't a big deal -- I knew it wouldn't be, to him, but it is, to me, because he doesn't know what else I'm doing. I can't decide what to do. This is like some soap opera where everything might be okay if everyone knew everything. In my case, only I know everything and I have no idea what to do about it.  Found this online, don't remember where:  Warning signs that your employees are considering leaving: 1. A change in behavior, such as coming in late or leaving earlier. 2. A decline in performance. 3. Sudden complaints from someone who hasn't been a complainer. 4. Wistful references to other companies. 5. Withdrawing from others. 6. Talk about burnout.    1, 3, and 6 apply to me. The rest don't. Maybe I'm not quitting?  When talking to the boss, I decided that my first priority would be not to make promises I can't keep. I think I did make a promise or at least suggest something I have no intention of doing. Actually, I made no commitments other than to open up my availability on weekends (mornings only won't cut it).   I am so tired, but I want to do something that I want to do, but also I work in 11 hours. I should get some sleep. And a haircut -- if I get a haircut, I won't have to shower 1.5 hours before work! I am reading a great book. I'll share some, later. Right now I'll read before watching the requisite Simpsons episode before bed.

      Okay, so it seems like everyone is my boss these days. Pretty much true. Anyway, when I was hired at CC the store director was out, so I just interviewed with the sales manager and operations manager. When I met the store director, even though I was hired, he wanted to ask me a few interview style questions. Of course, I was not in interview mode, but rather in make friends with the associates mode, so my answers were silly and not well contrived. Yes, contrived. Anyway, I'll get to my point soon enough. This was more than a week ago, so it's not a big deal, besides just my innocent honesty getting me into trouble.  Erik: "why'd you want to leave your other job?" Me: "they'd only schedule me two days a week and then call me in if it got busy" Erik: "we'll give you more than two days a week." Me: "it's just the unpredictability of running like that. plus I can't lift the water bottles" Erik: "water does weigh eight pounds a gallon"  Anyway, I've been thinking about that conversation more, because there should have been other reasons. Any reason, talking about the Union, lack of mental challenge, dirty food, you name it -- it would have been better. I'm just glad I didn't mention problems with customers. I'm still in customer service.  So, when I talk to Dave tomorrow, I'll have to be careful. I might very well tell him I'm unhappy in Philly, because a large part of all of this has been mental drain. I will not tell him that I've never had a job for more than three months and his three months is past. Seriously, I've only been working there three months as of June 23. It feels like forever!

      I worked tonight, just for 4.5 hours, at the market. I came in at 6 - word was that the boss wanted to have a word with me about my availability. I'm talking boss boss, the store director, the headiest honcho in the building. Anyway, I say that I came in at 6 because it explains that he was on his way out. He mentioned to me that he did want to speak with me, and he didn't seem upset, but in my trademark paranoia I'm foreseeing a Carmelita-esque meeting (the name of the woman who stole all the stuff from CC). I haven't stolen anything, and I'll go to my meeting.  I'm nervous. I should relax.  I bought a CD this morning, one I'd been wanting for a while. I had gone to Target and TJMax to look for cheap pants to wear to work. Couldn't find any. I'm the wrong size; no one deserves to be a 4tall. Anyway, I did buy the new (only) Mindy Smith CD. I played it on the drive home and the rest of the tracks in the house, then I put it back in the car. So the first time I really paid attention to this song was coming home from work tonight. I really hate just quoting a song, because there is so much more to the performance of the lyric than just the word, but I cried:  Life's so hard, it's the little things that seem to be getting me today. Yeah, life's so hard, but I'm doing what I can not to be getting down while I'm going down in flames.  Mindy Smith is amazing.  Finally, the last part of my day. I've been looking forward to Kara coming all week. I was surprised when I drove by the house not to see her car or any lights on, but I had a message that she was going to dinner with Dave. She offered that I might meet her somewhere because she really wanted to hang out. I figured maybe she meant Tabitha and David, some other friends of hers, because I could hardly hear the message (she must have called from her car with the window down). My point: I don't know who Dave is. Well, they came home, she and Dave, and she introduced him, "J, this is Dave." Then they played with the cat and went to her room to watch a movie.   I still don't know who Dave is. Or what happened to Mike. But I'm glad they don't want to both hang out with me because I'm not in a good mood. Just as I'm getting ready to post this, I read back through it, and the line where I say "I should relax" makes me glad I don't have the opportunity to talk to Kara right now because she'd offer me pharmaceutical therapy. Then I would never get another job!

      Yesterday was quite the day at work. Actually, it was Thursday that things went down, but I found out yesterday. This one woman who sells camcorders and stuff -- I had heard in the morning meetings that she's doing really well, selling way above quota and getting lots of customer compliments for her service and knowledge, always doing well selling the service plan (which could be considered a way for the company just to profit). Anyway, she has been found out for giving away more than ten thousand dollars worth of merchandise. She has accomplices, who come in to the store, "buy" an Ipod or whatever  and a Coke  and she appears to be tendering the sale -- deactivates tags, etc,-- and only charges for the drink.  Apparently she's been doing this for a while, and they've caught her, not in the act, but by matching security tapes to sale records.   Yesterday the police and district managers were there, but she didn't show.   Wow. I never would have guessed that this woman would do that. I know the store director never suspected, and he is surely going to feel the loss of her saleswomanship as he looks for a new product specialist in her area.

      Here's a good story for you:  I pretty much take anything as a return, in both my jobs. You can buy a gallon of chocolate milk, drink half of it, and return it. I'll give you your money back if you have a receipt and it's within a couple of days. It's easier at the electronics store -- I can even look up your receipt there! But then again, the products are never "half used".  Okay, so what happened today? This was a particularly unpleasant scam. Someone attempts a scam pretty much daily with me that I catch -- I don't know how many slip by me. So a woman walks up to the counter with some expensive stuff from the health/beauty aid section. Like stuff you use for contacts, diet drinks (think Glucerna or whatever) -- basically the most expensive stuff she can get her hands on. And a bottle of nail polish remover. She puts her stuff down and dumps the nail polish remover all over the counter, which, of course, removes the ink from her receipt. Yeah, she just wanted some money, but there was a whole bottle of nail polish remover on me and the counter. And I look like a bad customer service associate when I'm telling her firmly that I can't give her cash.  Eh.

      I have no theme, no direction, no boundaries.  I'm probably going to quit my job at the market. The problem is that if I quit  now  it'll be as if I'm running away from my own irresponsibility. My boss gave me the "you've got to come to work when you're scheduled" talk. He didn't tell me a thing I didn't already know -- didn't help me out with the rest of the week I can't come in -- and had someone else tell me he's looked at the schedule and I've called out the past three Sundays. This is not true. I don't know whether he's exaggerating or whether the messenger got confused, but I don't like him sending other people after me for stuff I didn't do. The deal is that I like working there, but when I look at my check, I think that this is not worth it. So not worth it.  I sold pork tails the other day. Yes, pork tails. I've sold pig ears and chicken feet and various livers, gizzards, and whatnot, but the pork tails really tapped out my toleration.  Yesterday I had to hold up a line of people for a woman quibbling over 50 cents and a principle, when I was already doing her a favor. Her tortillas rang up 2.99 when she thought they were market 1.99. There are all kinds of flavors -- she chose Carb Control -- whoever eats that junk should know it's never cheap! Anyway, I tried to fix this for her since hers weren't marked, and she threw a fit. Then the following customers say nasty things to me. For instance, I say, "Thank you for being patient. Do you have a supercard?" The reply: "I am not patient."  Maybe I had something else to write. Anybody see the Cardinals out homer the Cubs? Fantastic! And Kara is coming this weekend.

Even so, I think I'm going to have to watch Reality Bites tonight after work. I need a movie about someone my age, not some happy 18-year-old or 11th grader. Any suggestions for other movies featuring confused 23-year-olds?  Yes, I'm off to work. For six hours. Today is the only day of the week I get paid more for working at the market -- alas, I cannot skip out on my training. If I were to call in, it would be something like, "you want someone to cover your training? sure! we're all trained. consider it done." I don't know. I'm making stupid jokes.  I just wanted to write something. Too bad I don't have anything to say! I must eat, for I will have no other opportunity until after 5:00 tonight.

And it's not like I'm letting anybody get away with anything.  I met the store director at my new job today. He's a jerk, and he told me so. I heard him get a little firm with some employees, too. I hear that the market store director can be rough, too, so I guess I just need to stay on everyone's good side.  Tonight, I watch Simpsons and go to bed. Tomorrow, I work, pick up a check and schedule, do some shopping, and rest. Saturday, movie day. Sunday, back to work... at least my baseball team is winning.

      As last night was the first night I'd had off in a while, I made some  special phone calls. Tobi didn't answer her phone at first, and then I was talking to Mandy when she returned my call. I got her wedding reception invitation the other day, and in it was a photo of her and Kevin. This picture really cracked me up -- I hope she meant it to be cute and funny rather than serious! I put it on my icebox.  I talked to one friend of mine for a couple of hours, and she might come up here to see me. :)  I'm not in a mood to leave town. She is.  Since Kara left, I've not spent time with any girls (can I still say that? is this attitude what keeps me young?) my own age. Saturday I'm going to hang out with Lara. I can't wait.

      I honestly hope keeping both works out. I'm not good at saying no or quitting.  My training and orientation is all computer based. Which means I sit in the training room alone and do it.  I have met a few people: the operations manager is the man I've worked most with. He's second in command of the store and helped me with my paperwork. I saw the sales manager, who is the man who interviewed me. He pulled my hair. He's not incredibly mature. I also met another person in my position. She said to me, "hi, how old are you?" I laughed. I repeated the question (thinking, I'm old enough that you did not ask an appropriate question!). She nodded, and I answered. She figured I was lying -- "you look younger!" Great.  Enough of that. I only stayed three hours today. Tomorrow I work longer and go straight to the market afterward. It's doable, but a long day. It'll be a challenge to get moving by 11:00, too. Wish me luck.

      Tonight at the market I saw Dave, another first year in my department. He was shopping and was pretty surprised to see me. And guess what -- he dropped out of school! Before the end of the term, he quit. Man. Man.  Anyway, I can't explain how this makes me feel. Pretty strange, because he did what I should do. Or what I think I should do, but what I won't do.  Just -- when I stared philo school, I hoped to run into a lot of people like me. I didn't find a lot, but I did find Dave. I'm sad to see him give up. Ugh.

       Redheads attract crazy people.   If you are not crazy, you probably do not like my hair. If you do like my hair, you will probably tell me so, as if I've never heard it before. If you are a crazy person who is attracted to red hair, you will have no trouble telling me that you love "cherry redheads" or "there are women, and then there are redheads." Gag me.  One of the baggers can say four things:  1. Make that money! 2. Take care of yourself! 3. Nice lady! 4. I like your hair.   He can only say these four things (the hair comment only to me). He is always happy, living a limited life. Oh yeah, he can say "My name is Steven." If you say "Hi, Steve," he'll correct you: "my name is Steven."  I miss Kara and our redhead bonding. I might turn to the bottle here on my own...

      Bored out of my mind.   I have half a roll of film with wedding pictures. The other half has yet to be taken. I really want to develop those, mostly so I can see whether I looked awful. I sensed disdain from every Mormon woman as she looked at my neckline. At least I seem to have given it some thought, unlike a few others who were just too adorable in their fashion and probably looked better out of paranoia-free confidence. Also, I need to see whether I am ready for a haircut. I know I am ready -- I just feel like I'd be selfish if I don't get 10 inches cut to  urlLink donate . I am not  that  ready.   I enjoyed lunch while watching the parking lot today at a cafe across the street from my work. I saw two dozen cars cut off a truck trying to turn into the parking lot. He just needed one of them to hang back so he could fit in -- I have trouble imagining that none of them figured that out. Even better, I saw some woman in a Jaguar who couldn't drive. She was leaving but was afraid to pull out. Every time she got within 5 feet of the curb behind her, she'd go forward again rather than just turn and get out of her spot. She went back and forth four times before successfully wiggling out. No kidding. What use is such a car if you're afraid to drive it?   I'm going to watch live television. Now. To learn something. Here's what I've learned so far: all those old military guys have lots more hair than the general population of men. They don't mention that on the radio.

       things I've not been doing lately:   watching the Democratic National Convention  eating actual meals  reading any philosophy    &nbsp;   things I've been doing lately:   watching The Simpsons  listening to reports and speeches of the Convention on NPR  buying convenience sandwiches I don't even like   One slightly political note: on Sunday I was watching Fox News Sunday and saw their piece on some Boston tabloid writer who really doesn't like John Kerry. Remembering at least part of what he said (that this man will never wait in line) and hearing about the arrangements for the Convention (grand entrance by boat? specially built central platform only to be used by Kerry?) it does seem to me that we have a race for King. Whose birthright is right? Why not vote for Carter?

      I thought I'd be looking forward to getting back to my own life. Eh, not so much. Besides seeing my favorite people and enjoying the increasing friendliness day by day, things are not worth wishing a break to be over about. Something I could have told you years ago really hit home yesterday -- over and over.   I've come to realize something about people's attitudes: they get what they expect. Look for problems, find problems. Bitter people go around and become more embittered. My mother does this, like at Sam's when they have someone to check receipts on the way out. "Such a shame," she'll say, "to treat everyone like a criminal." That would always embarrass me. Truth is, your complaint goes to someone for whom this is  just a job . And those for whom this is not just a job, they don't care how you feel.   So go ahead, tell ME our receipts are too long. Or that it's a shame such a high-tech place doesn't have a debit keypad. Or my current favorite: that it's my fault your credit card was denied. And if you say "fuck it, I'll buy my PDA someplace else," you're just making yourself seem like more of a jerk than I already thought you were when you insisted you required someone who knew jack about them to come talk to you.   I say, Good Riddance.

      I bought the wrong color blinds. I was too concerned about size and distracted by some salesguy telling me the benefits of different brands that I forgot to check the color. Even if I had, I doubt I would have realized that alabaster is not what I want. They look old and stained -- yellowed, not  alabaster .

      I made it back.   I did get in touch with Jessie Sunday morning and arrange a lunch visit with her. That might have been the highlight of my trip. Steph said I should feel privileged that Bobby talked to me. Man, what a life.   Now, on with grocery shopping and laundry and replacing those blinds.   Kara left a note. I have decided I can't trust her to care for the cat when I go to Memphis. She doesn't care about anything or anyone but herself. Don't know what I'm going to do about that one.

Love is for suckers.  Next time I'm going with my gut. I wish I didn't come here. Honestly, I tried to have a good time. Just not happening. Yeah, because of my bad attitude, but not just that.

      Almost time to go. Still not excited about it.   I actually had a really good day. It's hard to explain why. :) I'm moody -- that's a good reason, right?   Concerning work, I'm taking notes on people's perceptions of my capabilities. In my department, our basic (shared) responsibilities are to run checkout, answer phones, take returns, and put items in for service. So in one day, the following scenarios might take place (they did):  1. I'm at checkout. Customer comes up to ask a question, then asks, hesitant, "oh, you work the  cash register "  2. I answer a phone call. Customer is concerned about her credit card. I give her contact information for the bank, which is not good enough. I'm supposed to have full access to her statements and the ability to apply her payment to various charges.  3. Customer wants to get his plasma television. I'm supposed to be able to hand it to him over the counter. This one really makes me angry -- he refused to let the warehouse guys load it up and couldn't understand that it is physically impossible for the thing to go over the counter or for me to lift it that high. Or at all.  4. Aside from the most popular question, "where are the restrooms?", the second most popular question I get out at the checkstand: "is that your natural haircolor?" Multiple times a day -- this is weird.   I broke the a set of miniblinds this morning. So far this summer I'd only broken multiple glasses and the backglass from my car. Oh, and a pilates resistance band. I was working on my muscles (to move plasmas) and must have underestimated my own strength. But this kind of tops it all because I really need some sort of window covering -- I'm not into communing with the vagrants on my porch.

      I was messing around in the freezer and knocked an ice cube out. I saw it heading straight for my bare foot. I thought about moving my foot, but thought, "it's just a piece of ice." I let the ice hit my foot. Big pain.   My friend is having a party Saturday night. I'm going to pass it up for the wedding. Instead of wishing her happy birthday, or even asking how old she'll be, I had a little diatribe about my dreaded trip. I'm too selfish for my own good. (By the way, I took care of the rest right after. Except the age part -- I've already mentioned that I no longer find that question appropriate conversation, and since that incident with Elise I've been asked several times more.) Speaking of having nothing to do on Saturday nights brings up a story. One guy at work, I'll go out on a limb and call him pathetic, he's always saying weird stuff to me. Probably not just to me. Last Saturday I got off at 4:00. He told me about one Saturday he didn't work and didn't know what to do with himself.   One more day in Philly for a while.   &nbsp;

      All summer everyone has been taking turns going on vacation. So today I saw one of my bosses after ten days or so, much bronzed and just as clueless as ever. I was actually excited to have him back and have the top guy gone; alas, no. Of course it's better to work with a jerk who knows what's going on and who appreciates me than it is to work with a nice guy who is clueless and attempts to correct me when I'm doing things as I should. I'm ready for my vacation.   I have news about school starting. I hear there are more than 10 people in the new class. Maybe they'll be good for the department. I hope they won't be disappointed. Or if they are, I hope I'm next in line for their money... If I have time, I'll meet some of them in a few weeks.&nbsp;   Love&nbsp;warmed over: AE canvas purse.  Love gone cold: coffee with&nbsp;Equal.  Love burning hot:&nbsp;smelling like summer.  &nbsp;

      I don't live alone. I live with six fish, some ants, a cat, and ... a mouse. Probably more than one mouse.  &nbsp;  Just when I thought my cat had finally lost  all  her marbles after spending all evening staring at the couch, I saw a mouse peeking out from under the couch (the other end of it, naturally). This is troubling to me, because I don't want to live with a mouse. I don't like coming to know that all these little specks on the carpet are mouse droppings. I  really  don't want to find a dead mouse -- or worse, a half-eaten mouse -- anywhere in my house.  &nbsp;  I don't know how it got in, I don't know what it's eating, I don't know what the appeal of living under the couch is, and I don't want to think about the other places it's going. Change all the "its" to "theys" and things become more troubling.  &nbsp;  I looked into this problem. I read that there are likely to be lots of mice by the time you see one. And that they can squeeze through a quarter-inch hole. Besides windows, I only have one entryway, with no hole or crack that size besides the mail slot. I can't figure this out. There's no trace of the mouse being in the pantry (can they scale walls?).  &nbsp;  I'm optimistic. I hope this is one stray mouse that snuck in the door the past day or so. The cat has just now started acting nuts, so maybe... maybe he can get out the same way he got in. He was headed to the door when I saw him.

      3rd Rock. Still one of my favorite shows. Comes on at 2:30, so I only get to see it on Mondays.  &nbsp;  Read about Leibniz until I thought my eyes were going to pop out. I stopped just in time to keep that from happening.  &nbsp;  Actually, I met a man yesterday whose eyes were so intense and his eyelids were so wide that his eyes were actually popping out. There was space between the edge of the eyelid and the eyeball in the inner and outer corners. Kind of freaky, but not particularly ugly.  &nbsp;  I've been taking notes, by hand, on the stuff I'm reading for my exam. My handwriting is awful. My spelling is worse. I'm going to work on that. Seriously. I've always counted a person's handwriting in with the way I think of that person. Just like a person's face or voice or mannerisms, handwriting is, for me, part of how I remember people. Other things I forget -- the way they dress, or phone numbers, or other stuff I can't think about. I always hate when I know someone for a short time and can't see the way the person writes.  &nbsp;  I see people sign all the time (credit card slips). Most people don't actually write their names.&nbsp;I need to work on a new signature, I guess, which looks nothing like my name.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I saw an ugly girl wearing a shirt I own. Very troubling.  &nbsp;  Kara came and left -- it didn't go well. I understand she didn't come to see me, but not even to talk to me? Then ask, "are you mad at me?" As if it's me who's mad, and she's the victim of it. I wasn't mad, just shocked. I stayed home and she came in and shut herself in her room.  &nbsp;  Spent yesterday afternoon listening to XM radio. I can't imagine subscribing to it.  &nbsp;  I'm torn between eating all my food just to use it and not eating all my food to slim down for Saturday's dress up. Probably a little bit of both.   I'm a follower. A conformist. I see other people with something, and I decide I need it. So last night I bought  The Tipping Point , the new CD from The Roots. Everyone has been raving about it -- all kinds of people -- and I decided to get it. Had trouble landing a copy -- evidently waiting until everyone else buys it leaves no copies left for me! But it's good. Seriously good.  &nbsp;  I don't want to go to work today. I'm not dressed, and I don't want to get dressed. I need to leave in 20 minutes.

      One week until Indiana. I'm tempted to ask Mike to come with me. I won't, mostly because I'm afraid he'll say yes.  &nbsp;  It's cold today. I'm going to take a shower and put on a sweatshirt.  &nbsp;  I'm reading a book.  Some Girls . It's trashy and predictable in the worst ways, but I think I'm going to finish it. I don't want to read anything heavy or smart, but I do want a good story. This isn't it. My one-day reprieve from philosophy is making me ready to get back to it soon. Not today, but soon.

      Scary sale of the week (slash my lifetime): radar detectors to 17-year-old boys.  I dreamed about a vending machine that sells pot.   They're repainting my apartment, exterior. Looking out my window this morning I saw the midriff of a fat painter on a ladder. Odd balance.  Money is burning a hole in my pocket. I want a new phone and a haircut.  Kara's coming tomorrow. With some cousin. To go to a fishstore.  It's not going to feel like summer until I get hot. I have a flight for the end of August.

      Yesterday was such a fantastic day. I feel so much better after quitting that job at the market, and the more I get into things at the new job, the better I feel about it and the more I wonder why I stuck it out so long at the other place. Did that make any sense at all?  My boss adores me. Granted, this is because we're both cold, obsessive about neatness, and smiling but impersonal. I wouldn't call myself a workaholic, but I don't whine for a break every six hours. He let me know yesterday how happy he is I've come along.  I am also learning how to ignore customers when they prattle to each other about how awful this place is. Because it's not, and they know as much, but occasionally there is a problem. The store is so noisy that it's no problem for me to lean away and avert my eyes and "not hear" whatever it is they are saying. I realized this is a fine thing to do when I was trying to adjust a tax difference (6% in our store, 7% in another county) and, although the two customers were jabbering about what a pain this is for them, once I fixed the problem and handed them the ticket, they smiled, thanked me, and left.

      I was about to write a little rant about love and friendship, but I checked my email first and things have changed. Kind of weird feeling to go from being so disgusted to so loved in all of a minute.   Anyway, I was upset because I feel obligated to go to my friend's wedding, next weekend, 500 miles away. I don't want to drive out there, I don't want to be there, ... I am having trouble with the newest part of my life in which my friends are marrying. In some situations, it's fine. Example: Steph. Ever since I've known her, she's been attached. I spent two years with the engaged Steph, and now she's married Steph. Other examples: Phil, Matt, Scott, etc. All married (or engaged) from the day I met them. Plus, they're older. And of the marrying age (to me that's close to 30).   I was thinking about the present case yesterday. I had to go to the post office, and it was raining very hard. I figured I might as well go out, and I got soaked. Coming back in the house, I had to leave my clothes at the front door and head straight for the shower. The last time something like that happened was just about a year and a half ago, when T was so upset because her friends made her admit she liked Kevin. She cried and cried and insisted she wasn't drunk and insisted she didn't love him. So we played in the rain and got so cold and got the shower so muddy. (I miss those hot showers in the house, mine here is hot and cold.) I remember her saying how wonderful it was that I believed her. Now I have to go to their wedding. I feel like a fool.  Just in defense of this, because I don't know who all reads what I write, I believe that at that time she was not acknowledging her feelings because there were some big obstacles. I believe that things have since changed, especially in the months immediately following that incident. I think that I am lonely and jealous. Finally, I'll conclude with what I learned from Spinoza yesterday, paraphrased and probably grossly misunderstood by me: love happens when we see another person who makes us want to preserve ourselves. Yeah, I really don't think that's what he meant -- it's certainly not what he said.

      So yeah, I've investigated a shortcut to learning the history of philosophy. In addition to the Heston tapes, I picked up a copy of Spinoza in 90 minutes (no, I didn't  purchase  it). It's awful. Well, I guess it's accurate enough, but terribly written. Parts made me laugh out loud, so I'll share my favorite passage. Seriously, read it:  One by one Spinoza was assembling the ingredients which when cooked in the hot oven of his intellect were to produce the unsurpassed confectionary of his philosophy: a creation of infinite sweetness, containing a mouth-watering variety of philosophical cherries, plum observations, and sickly theological cream, all overlaid with marzipantheism and coated with rigid icing, topped by the single glowing candle of its uniqueness.

      Two days completely off. Always boggles me as to what to do.  So I went to the mall. Not because I wanted to, but because I need something to wear to Tobi's ring ceremony. First of all, I've lost two sizes since cooking for myself, so my clothes don't fit, and I need something summery yet conservative. I guess.  Shopping sucks. Nothing in the right size, long lines for the dressing rooms, everything extravagant or excessively cheap, ... After pulling out my hair at Macy's, I bought a skirt from Express. I still need a top.  Still making my way through Spinoza. I should finish up with him tomorrow (tonight if I were on top of things) and move on.

The Cardinals are also winning -- they've got the best percent in the NL. I love my baseball teams :)  I all the sudden feel like I have a whole lot of time. Not much on my plate anymore. I do have some help to understand Spinoza, in the form of audio cassettes narrated by Charlton Heston. Can't get any better than that, can you?  (Title from an Audioslave song I heard on the radio on my way home. Sidenote, if there is such a thing: that, along with Mindy Smith, are the two best CDs I have bought this year. I want multiple copies of each, one for home, one for car, one for walkman, and on and on...)

      Maybe you remember my dear friend Phil. I just realized that the advice he gives to me is much like the advice he would give to himself, and so this makes much sense if you know him. Here's the advice he gave me regarding taking a course at Penn in the fall:   Here are the plusses of taking courses through the consortium at Penn: 1. You take a course at an ivy league school, with a well respected expert in the field. This is an amazing opportunity. 2. You get to find out what the really serious smart people are doing when they take a philosophy class. (Which admittedly is not always very different from what we do, but sometimes it's interestingly different. i.e. everybody may have something intelligent to say.) 3. You will have to work very hard.  Here are the possible minuses: 1. People in the class may make you feel, well, like you should have started reading Aristotle already, in Greek, from the age of 5. 2. Instructors as well as students may not take your participation as seriously or respectfully as their own 'kind'. (Unless of course you really are the kind who belongs at an ivy, and you just landed at Temple as a fluke.) 3. You will have to work very hard. 4. Your grade will not be displayed on your transcript, nor will the fact you took the class from the 'Great Penn'. In other words, no one will officially know that you went all the way over there to take the damn course with a bunch of know-it-alls. It will just be between you and whatever you put on your CV.  If you think about all of this, and you're still excited about it, I say: go for it! Feel what it's like to go to a place that's almost as good as Harvard.   He's awesome. :)

      Okay, so I changed my profile photo from a plate of Brussels sprouts to one that's actually of me. My hair looks funny.  I'm thinking of getting it cut. Don't worry -- I can't afford a good haircut right now. No more cheap haircuts!  I'm actually in a bit of a challenge to myself: this week is no-spending week. I've made it two days. I know it won't save me any money, but it might be good to spend all at once rather than a bit here and there so I can more fully understand how much I'm spending.

      So I said last post I was watching Gia. Mostly just because Kara has plenty of movies I haven't seen and an Angelina Jolie obsession and I had some free time and there was nothing on television. That's what the title is from; however, it goes downhill from there. Something like "every dollar you make, someone else had to spend." As if that is ever anything other than true.  I made a list of things to write about yesterday when I was at work just standing around. Here's the list:    Bowling    Claw vs. Red Sox    Yogurt incident    Saturday    Buy chicken    CS talk  I remember what a few items on it mean, but I'll only make one into a post paragraph. Only because it goes along with what I've already written about money.  Yogurt incident : I'm working customer service at the market. Some woman comes up and asks whether we have a certain kind of yogurt. I kindly offer to check the shelf for her, notice that there is a spot for it, and it's empty. I'd spoken with the dairy manager about 20 minutes earlier as he was leaving for the day. He told me he'd put out everything he has. No one is going to hide good food from potential buyers!  So I tell this to the yogurt woman, apologize for the inconvenience, and she  GRABS MY ARM  and tells me it's not about yogurt, it's about money. She said that someone fucked up the order, and now she must buy little cups of yogurt. No, she didn't want a different brand of the same stuff. I know she was upset, but I don't know what she wanted me to do -- press a button and have 32oz containers of fat-free Dannon descend from the heavens?  Enough. Two days off!

      I have been expecting a package all week. It should have arrived today -- and would have -- but I was not here to sign for it. It's through UPS, so I can't pick it up at the post office, and the next delivery attempt will be Tuesday between 1 and 5. I work at 3, so I hope it comes before that...   How awful to be looking forward to it and it not being left.  I hate working at a grocery store.  I am watching Gia and going to bed.

      Things are going my way, but I'm too tired to reap the benefits. Later, later...   Spinoza is draining me.   An old man tried to pick me up.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow just so I can drink coffee. And sit in the sunshine. The rest of tomorrow can wait.  The other night there was a guy changing in the breakroom, surprised to see me because he figured "there were no girls working." True enough, besides me, there weren't. I wanted to tell him I didn't even notice that he was in the room, but I didn't want to hurt his feelings. I don't spend enough time around women.

      Friday the 13th.  My department is having a gathering to meet the new students and answer their questions. I had thought about going, but I won't, because my primary interest is a nosy one. I want to see whether they are young. I want to know how many of them are women. Those in department is generally older than I am -- not just because I'm only a year into it -- and consists of about 28 men and 7 women. My class brought in 4 women. I would like to see strong representation continue, but I don't want this to become the place where women go to study philosophy.   One very good reason I'm not upset about missing out on this. An email from one of my colleagues: "I'll have to talk to my wife tonight, but there's chance I can attend more of these casual get-togethers now that we've moved closer to Philadelphia." Gag me.

      I haven't been watching Cribs lately, but my favorite part is always when they open the fridge. Here's mine:&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     I have: beer, diet soda, energy drinks, tortillas, hummus, cream cheese, butter, bread, more diet soda, yogurt, tea, water, more energy drinks, garlic pickles, orange juice, and soymilk. In the drawers: lettuce, carrots, and tofu. On the door: salad dressing and olives.

      Everything has been going more or less well at work lately. I have now been in my job for just over two months (my record for length of time at one job is just under three months, so I'm about to break that!). I'm asking fewer questions, doing more things right, and spending less time annoying my co-workers, managers, and customers. After spending two months being made fun of, I say it's about time.  This morning a customer came up to me with a tax exempt order. He'd already been rung up in the department where he was shopping, then stopped by checkout, then came up to me. I was supposed to look up his tax exempt number: he insisted that no one could fax the appropriate form over. While I'm looking through the file, he's hassling me and I have to ask him three times to stop touching me. We were fighting (with words) and I was very mean to him. We were very mean to each other.  Anyway, he had already made out his check for the purchase including tax. (Dumbass) I took the check and gave him cash for the difference. I bet his employer is never going to see that difference -- and he stole stuff from me. He had me so angry that I didn't check what he was carrying against his receipt, and he walked right out with stuff he didn't buy. Then he  came back  and asked me to tell him for how much he wrote the check. I should have told him, "uh the amount on your receipt plus that cash..." oh well, too late.  I never know what to make of this kind of interaction. With abusive swindlers. I want to be nice. I want to be trusting. I have to be serious and firm. I'm running at about 20% -- one of every five people I deal with finds me nice or helpful (not always the same thing). To everyone else, I'm just an example of "everybody needs good help." I did get some good help today at Home Depot on my lunch break -- I needed keys cut, and I was helped before anyone else who needed to talk to this guy because his manager (who I stopped to talk to on my way in) told him to help the redhead. :)

      Made it to the library and back. Whew. I had to talk myself into going. Here's how: it'll be like shopping in an amazing bookstore with poor architecture where all the books are free. And it's closer than King of Prussia.   I am pretty easily swayed, no? In case you had a moment when you thought I wasn't boring, here's what I picked up.  Learning from Six Philosophers, Vol. 1 Learning from Six Philosophers, Vol. 2 Essays on Kant and Hume Leibniz in Context Kant, Art, and Art History Kant's Theory of Taste Essays on the Philosophy and Science of Rene Descartes Freedom and Independence Idealism and Freedom  Anybody want to read to me? I am doing well with more Heston tapes.

      The end of the summer is in sight. Time to get to business, seriously. Today I'm going to the library. That means driving half an hour to campus and finding a place to parallel park a Crown Vic. I got away with so much when I drove my little car.  One week until I leave for Memphis. I am so excited I can hardly speak. Yesterday Ras visited me. We never really talked about where we're from, but he knows I'm from Memphis and I know he's from Georgia. His accent was strong from visiting his father in Nashville. There was just a moment like, "it's a different world up here, isn't it?" and "coming for school isn't a good enough reason to be here." I do have to disagree: when I'm in school, I'm with other displaced people. When I'm in school, I am constantly reminded of my purpose in being here.  There is something utterly refreshing about making friends with people who aren't from here. As much as I like, say, Elise, there's something fundamentally different about someone who is 21 years old, living with her parents, going to a local satellite campus of the State University, and dating her high school sweetheart.   In summary, I'm not quite delirious with homesickness. I have a point. I have a crush. Walking with said crush to the parking lot, was it his Lexus that impressed me? No, sadly, that seems wasteful and superficial. It was his Florida tags.

      Tonight was really odd. Not only did I have customers with off the wall requests, the manager of the night didn't want to deal with anyone. I have mixed feelings about this particular man -- I like him a lot, but I don't think he's doing well in his job.  We got a phone call from some customer who wanted to complain about the size of the receipts. Whoever asks to speak with a manager is suppposed to be able to speak with one if possible, but Dave told me he wasn't going to talk to this person.   A man comes in to return his defective DVD player. He bought it 9.23.03. I tell him we have a 30-day return policy and I can't take it back. He tells me he's been a lawyer for 14 years and ... well, he didn't really finish that sentence.   Another man comes in to return a DVD, and I ask what was wrong with it and offer to switch it out for the same title. He asks whether he can get a refund (no) and whether he can get store credit (no). He asks to speak to the manager. I tell Dave what's up, which is odd because this guy didn't seem upset. He seems perterbed, and I tell him that I can't tell this customer no one wants to talk to him. He agrees, saying that he'll talk to people but not crazy people. Turns out this is the on-the-phone receipt guy! I think this man is crazy. Follow his line of thought: 1. Your receipts are too long. You're killing too many trees. 2. I offer to write our corporate number on his long receipt, joking that I won't waste any more paper. 3. He says it's not the paper he's concerned about -- it's the bad business practices. 4. Which is why (he says) he wanted to return that DVD (I say: for store credit?).

      This is going to be scattered, but I want to post something big. 98% of whoever reads this will probably think I'm too far out there. Oh well. Lots of stuff on my mind. I'll set out my intended direction right now -- just see how I will combine these! First, Kant. Second, the people I work with. Maybe no one is interested in what I have to say about Kant, but if I could tell a better story about my co-workers I could write something interesting. Don't worry -- I didn't.   As I've mentioned before, I am deliberately neglecting primary source readings for the time being in favor of reading about the history of philosophy. So this morning I've been reading  about  Kant. I do like him, but he probably wouldn't have liked me. (I might be misunderstanding some of this because I have certain views already.) He sounds like a great professor and good company, good conversationalist, but he did not like the company of women. Women, to him, are inferior to men, although women have certain desirable qualities. Women are unreasonable, choosing good from a beauty virtue (rather than a noble virtue). Kant's (early) descriptors of beauty double for descriptors of women: delicate, pretty, superficial, conquerable, charming, weak, fair. On the other hand, men are diligent, fundamental, deep, dominating.   From (early) Kant:  "Laborious learning or painful pondering, even if a woman should greatly succeed in it, destroy the merits that are proper to her sex ... weaken the charms with which she exercises her great power over the other sex. A woman who has a head full of Greek ... might as well even have a beard; for perhaps that would express more obviously the mien of profundity for which she strives."    From a woman with a head full of Greek:  Typically these comments are "excused" because they aren't essential to Kant's watershed and come from pre-Critical thought. Even so, he shows the age-old idea that the fall is attributable to Eve and women can only exercise any sort of power by using feminine wiles.  I'll summarize two more things he mentions before leaving 1763 for 2004. 1) A woman who is too inconstant and deceitful is a coquette, which is less harsh than the masculine term (coquet, or cock if you're not French) for similar behaviors in a man. 2) Women owe it to men to heighten their beauty with dress and letting her merry wit play. Men owe it to women to compliment their looks -- a women who can't graciously accept a compliment is ill-bred.  I've been prone to spontaneous lectures on skopophilia, and I have a line running through my head I read somewhere. Can't remember where.  Men look at women; women watch themselves being looked at.  I agree that there are plenty of women who act as if all they have to offer the world is their bodies. The other night, there was young girl wearing a half-shirt who had a large audience of shameless gawkers. Seriously, the dropped jaws were disgusting and if she'd had an accomplice he (or ugly/modest she) could have easily walked out stealing whatever they wanted. I'm sure she dresses for attention (who else wears that shopping on a night when it's 65f?). I can believe how everyone stopped what he was doing to watch her (I was looking), including that night's manager. I can't believe how they all continued to discuss the incident (not the possible theft!) for ten minutes after she left, with me right there doing my best to ignore it. I can remember what the shirt looked like -- I can't remember what she looked like. I think these guys need to get out more. I think I need to find some girlfriends and hott men to oogle.  I have more sex-related work stories, but I'll save those for later, including a new ad campaign, which I will share soon.

      I'm watching The Simple Life. I can't believe I'm watching it.  Today: sewing rice paper, grocery shopping (biscuit-buying), window washing, general laziness.   I'll be on task, tomorrow.

      I went to bed very early last night -- so early, in fact, I thought I'd nap for a few hours, get up,  then  go to bed. I slept straight through what feels like a lot of hours (9 until 6). I do feel lazy when I sleep for more than 8 hours. I am well rested and have the day off, which means two things: 1. if I'm going to stay in the house, I need to clean up the mess that's accumulated in the last week; 2. I might have something actually worthwhile to say in a bit. Right now I'm going to enjoy a pot of coffee on the porch. It's a beautiful day.

      I can't sleep anymore. It was all I could do to settle down and try to lay in bed at 2, then I popped right up at 6 with a smile on my face.  I can almost identify the source of this problem, but I hate to acknowledge it. My mind was racing with everything from lost power cords to deontological ethics to switching schedules to midriff-baring half shirts and hearing loss. I need to find some breakfast. I'd really like a biscuit. That's not going to happen this morning.

      I said yesterday I've been having good days, or good moods, or something of the sort. True as that is, I have had a short fuse on occasion. You can't take away the redhead temper ;)  Anyway, some days all the noise at work gets to me -- phones ringing, people talking, the XM radio display in my face, forklifts behind me, televisions, sound systems, on and on and on... Today, right about 10 minutes before my time to go, I was taking a customer's phone number. I'm not making excuses for what happened: I'm setting the scene. I could hardly hear him because he was speaking softly and quickly. I told him I had bad hearing and to tell me the number again. He starts, 2-1-5... I say, "uh-huh..." he speaks louder, 2-1-5, "uh-huh..." louder, 2-1-5. And I snap back, "I've got that part!!" I felt awful for doing that. But once we both laughed, it was about the funniest thing of the day.   If this doesn't make sense to you, consider that 215 is the main local area code. Not the only one, which is why he started with it, but the main one.

      Several months ago a friend of mine and I were talking about Myers-Briggs typing. I remember taking a test through my college career center during freshman orientation and coming up with INFP. That test was probably the most extensive that I've had, but Jessie and I quizzed ourselves with a not-simple version in the spring. I found myself INTJ, likely the result of my schooling.   I'm not going into this for any particular reason. Just that I think I'm changing types again (not that it matters). I'm becoming very extroverted. To the point of annoyance. I can't keep quiet and can't think to myself.   Some people would say you can't change -- you can only become more yourself. I guess this means being more comfortable (or less comfortable) expressing yourself in the ways you are capable of expressing yourself. Is that change? I guess so. I'm not agreeing with that side. On the contrary is the American criminal justice system, based on the idea that people can change (rehabilitating criminals). Most arguments for capital punishment deal with the "victim's right" (eye for an eye, retribution) or "can't let this go unpunished" (deterrence?) rather than reform. Can't reform a dead person.

      I'm watching  Spiderman . Not because I particularly want to, but because I haven't yet seen it. I got bored, so I stopped it. The movie made me want muscles. Of my own. I'm working on it; I figure it'll only get harder as I get older. By the way, I told someone today how old I am (she asked). Her response: woah! I am not at a "woah" age. I don't know what her problem was. She figured I was 18. And told me so.  Mostly I opened this post because I'm baffled that I got two replies to my "modern philosophy sucks" post. My point was that this stuff is not why I signed up for philosophy school! Right now I'm wading through an abridged version of Locke's  Essay Concerning Human Understanding  with 280 pages ahead of me. I ought to look for a syllabus or something to help me choose key passages, but I'm even too lazy to actually do that. Instead, I stop watching a movie to complain about how it bores me. What a life.  Actually, I've been having a good couple of days. Unfortunately, I have to keep the details to myself, because when I get too excited too early, I jinx myself. Suffice it to say I am a happy girl. ;) Confused, but happy.

      This afternoon I walked to run some errands. On my way back, it started to sprinkle (light rain can be called sprinkles, right?). Then right after I make it onto the porch, there is a clap of thunder and the skies open.   The lake in my front yard.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Honestly I wouldn't have cared if it did rain on me walking back. As soon as I got in the house I hopped in the shower anyway. You thought I had something worthwhile to say? You should know better. :)

      Time to read. Locke. I went book shopping today because it's too frustrating to try to learn the history of philosophy from library books. It's not real unless it's mine, the way I see it.   Trouble is, once I got past the stuff I am familiar with and the stuff I like, I'm left confused and bored. I'm so easily swayed that I can't really pit opinions against each other and tend to side with whatever I'm currently reading. It's not as bad as it sounds, though, because there was plenty of mud-slinging and famous disagreements between the philosophers. I guess I should work on my own philosophical justification concerning why it doesn't matter how we perceive or how there is a mental activity resulting from a physical object. In the end, though, I agree it does matter, but I'll just leave that to the neuropsychologists. I don't think they can handle it alone.  Did I bore you? I am boring myself. But I must press on.

      I know there is typically a disjunct between the way a person perceives herself and the way others do. Add to this the fact that not everyone comments about you to your face, and you're left with a pretty odd feeling. Not you -- me. Of course I'm talking about me!  In the past couple of days, I've been given many half-compliments that really don't seem to describe me at all. As you read my stories, keep in mind that these are things people "accused" me of in attempting to say something "nice." Today really topped it all.   Early in the day, a customer has a problem. He wants to talk to a manager. I tell him precisely what the manager will tell him, but he says "you're too nice for me to argue with." My manager, who is not nice, got into a little argument with him. All either of them wanted to do today was argue.  One of the guys I work with called me bubbly. He says I'm always happy. Granted, I am happy, but I have never been called bubbly and can't understand my general love of life being mistaken for stupid effervescence. Speaking of  the smile , one customer I kept waiting for a very long time commented to Dave about me smiling (while on the phone resolving another issue). This made me feel good, until Dave then said to the man, "yeah, she's great -- always has a grin on." Grin makes me think sheepish or evil. Neither of which, I hope, describes me.  One last note. This is really what started the whole entry, about an intended compliment that would be a compliment if the person stopped a few sentences shorter. One customer told me I am very pretty. Thank you, I said. Then he said, "with all that hair and those big teeth..." Yikes. Way to call out a freak.

      Last night was something else. I had been dreading my first closeout all week, and it became even worse when I found out that the manager who was closing with me had only closed a few times. I was under the impression that he knew a thing or two. Oh well. We ended up staying until midnight. I can't count, and we had $10,000 cash. That's a really big number to count to.
