      ONS-Icarus is a new Onslaught map for UT2k4 written by one of the contract map builders working for Epic. It looks to be a great map. You can check is out  urlLink here . There are also links on the page to download it. I added it to the map rotation on the docsparky.gotdns.org server that is running in the evenings.

      Randall is in the process of moving and will be away from the computer for a couple of weeks. I'll still be checking the UT2k4 server around 9 or 10pm each night I can play. Looking at the logs for the server, it looks like some people like to play late. If that's a better time, let me know.

      Friday night on DocSparky.gotdns.org was pretty intense. The server managed to hold 4 and I suspect it will do 5 or 6 as well. That's a good thing since we are planning on building those numbers. One thing I noted is that the voice comm worked pretty well and helped a lot. Also, the team work was good as well.  There are plans for another game on Saturday at 9pm (earlier if people show up).

      I think we have a better shot at getting more people into a match if we set a target time to be on the server. I would submit that we have start times of 7pm and 9pm. Since I have 2 young children to help get in bed, I generally play around the 9pm time frame. Perhaps this Friday and Saturday we can get a good game going.   Update:  Rodney put his vote in for 9 pm.

      It looks like the power outage that I had at work gave my DSL connection a new ip address and my dynamic DNS updating didn't work. Bottom line? The UT2k4 server is not accessible. It's not down for good though. You can expect it to be online tomorrow night.  From the logs, I can see that it is being used. Perhaps it would be good to set some kind of schedule for games. Let me know if you've got a good solution.

Just unzip the 2 maps into the "maps" subfolder of UT2k4. I'm going to put them in the map rotation.

      We had a pretty good game of UT2k4 Onslaught going last night on the docsparky server. The hard part is getting on the server at the same time. I noticed that I'm unable to get the server info (i.e. ping and who is on) from home. It just shows a ? for ping. Anyone else having this problem? Perhaps I need to open a new port on the firewall.

      This past weekend started off well, but turned tragic with the death of my wife's 31 year old cousin. It will good to get into some UT2k4 this week.  I switched the router at the office where I'm running the dedicated server, so perhaps will perform a little better. It is still at the same name (docsparky.gotdns.org) with the same password (sparky). The game runs all evening, but generally jump in between 9-10pm (sometimes a little earlier).

      I'm still having problems keeping my UT2k4 running as long as I would like. I'm not talking about the server, it's running fine. I'm going to take apart my box this weekend and give it a good cleaning. I'll also add another case fan to move some heat. If that doesn't work, I guess I'll start planning that next upgrade.  Bill purchased UT2k4 this past week and has started playing some. If we could find a time to all join the server, we would be up to 5 humans on one time. We might have to try some Bombing Run. Any suggestions on a time to try to gang up on the server? Leave a comment.

      This is not an Epic release, but a compilation of material (maps, models and mutator) from the UT Community. A quote from their site:  This compilation began as a small project. A few of the Unreal community's best level designers got together to release a small pack of their best work to the community. As the time went on, the project grew into something far more significant, with more and more of the best Unreal talent out there joining the team. The map count went from a small handful to a fully-fledged professional-level bonus pack. With all this pack now complete, the team has decided to work on a number of future projects together to produce high quality work that will get noticed throughout the design community.   urlLink Community Bonus Pack for Unreal Tournament 2004

      It seems like the patch of UT2k4 has been pretty rocky. Last night I had my first computer crash while running the game as well as several software errors. The fiasco on Friday night wasn't pleasant at all. So the question is, do we stay with the patch or do we all uninstall and then reinstall the retail version? Let me know either with an email, IM or a comment here on the OTH Gaming site. I'm undecided at the moment.

      Don't panic if the server tells you you're running a speed hack.  It will hold you hostage for about 10-15 seconds then let you play as normal.  There is a tweak that James will add on Monday to help prevent this.

I say that so that if you are missing the games, check the server a little later in the evening around 11pm. I generally check it between 9:15 and 9:45 since that is about the time that my kids are in bed.

      Well, retail clients can still connect to a patched UT2k4 server. So if you don't want to patch, then you don't have to in order to connect to the server. The one nice thing about the patch is that the DVD (or CD) is no longer required to run the game. I didn't notice any problems last night with it the short time I played.  There was some serious lag at times though. I tracked this down to the max client net speed setting on the server. By default it is 10000 (on the other server, I had reduced it to 5000). I updated the value on the new server, so that shouldn't be a problem. Well, at least until we have more players.   urlLink Unreal Tournament 2004 Downloads

      Last night (and today) I programmed a little application that will watch a UT2k4 server and notify you when someone joins the server (since my machine wasn't up to the task of playing). It's a nice way to see if someone is playing without starting up the game. To install it, just unzip it into the directory of your choosing. You'll have to create the shortcut to it. If that's too much of a challenge, I can create an install.  urlLink ServerWatch.zip

      I haven't been able to play much this week (for several reasons), but I setup a CTF gametype last night for those that were able to play. It seems like everyone enjoyed the CTF matches the other night, so I'll try to run them on Tuesday and Thursday nights.  It is sometimes difficult to get everyone on the server at the same time (It seems that we all have more to do than just play games). I think it might be good to have a specific time of the weekend that we can try to be on the server. In general, I try to check at 9pm and 11pm on weekdays. If someone has a suggest weekend time, then post it and we can try to check in around that time.

Perhaps meeting at a restaurant (On the Border, Chili's, Ninfa's, etc..) or a coffee shop, or at someones house. It would not only be a good time to meet each other in person, but to also talk about current gaming and organize future gaming.  So what do you think?

      In case everyone hasn't noticed, Randall turned up the bot level this past weekend. This has had a pretty positive effect on the fun level when there a few people on the server. With the added competition, it's turned the intensity level up and made it more rewarding to win a match. The only strange side-effect that I noticed was that it made the games that I play with only myself on the server a little less fun. This is probably a testament to the quality of a human player, but it is frustrating trying to win a match with the bots doing goofy stuff.

      Randall,     I believe you mentioned to me at one time that you may have a group of people who are interested in getting Madden Football 2005 and creating a football league where we all compete against each other. Is that still in the works? If so, how many people are going to do that? Does anyone else in our group play any EA sports games? If so, what sports? I would be interested in participating in this, and my friend Brian would also be interested in Madden Football. Just trying to feel this out. Madden 2005 is set to come out early August.

      I guess I'll start this little idea rolling.  Been out browsing about a bit?  Find an interesting map that you think would be neat to play in a MP environment?  Post a link to it in here so everyone can see it...

      There has been some talk of trying to build a MOD for Unreal Tournament. There's probably a lot of map building that needs to be done as well. If you have ideas on Mods or want to volunteer to work on something, then join in on the comments of this thread.  Also, with the big MOD contest going on for Unreal, there are a ton of really cool mods out there. If you find one that seems fun enough to run on the server, post a link here so we can check it out.   urlLink UT2k4 Mod Author Support Site

      There is a new patch available for UT2004, but I'm going to hold off on installing it on the server just to make sure there aren't major slip ups in it. If people seem to have a positive experience with it, then I'll make the update.   Update:    From Steve Polge:      Epic Games is releasing patch version 3270 as the third official patch for Unreal Tournament.   This patch is completely compatible with the retail version and previous patches - servers and clients of any flavor can connect with each other. This patch will not overwrite your ut2004.ini and user.ini files, except to update settings as necessary.   So I guess it is okay for everyone to patch whenever then want to and they will be able to connect.

      I had a great time at the meeting last night. It was good to meet Frag_Food, Fish_Food and Homer. It seemed like everyone got a chance to talk about the games that interest them most and we were also able to talk about the future of OTH Gaming. Now that Frag is running the UT server in the evening, this will allow a lot of people with more modest machines to get in on the gaming fun. We also need to check into the LAN gaming place in Central and find out the prices. It would be a great place to have a LAN party every once in a while.

      We will be meeting at 7pm tonight, at Chili's on Seigen. If it's not your favorite, then I apologize. It seemed like everyone was already planning on meeting there since it was suggested first. First person there should get ask for a table for 6. See everyone then.

      UPDATE! - OK, I've put the GOTY server up, and I can only hope that it'll survive.  It's at http://flakmonkey.gotdns.org - password is fragf3st.  Y'all be nice to it.  I'll put it online daily at around 6:00PM and take it back down around 12:00 midnight.  Part-time, sorry.  BTW, FragFood.gotdns.org was already taken - I kinda like this one better anyway.  If there's any problems, send me an email - it's in my profile.  Jack

      After the fun we had the other night with the sniper love-in, I've decided to try  starting a full-time GOTY server on one of my machines.  It's probably gonna take some doing, seeing as I have absolutely NO idea of how it's supposed to work, but at least we can eventually get some of the lower end machines and players back on a more regular basis.  I'm hoping to have it up and running in the next coupla days, and I'll post the address once it's up.  Any ideas or suggestions are always welcome.  Jack
