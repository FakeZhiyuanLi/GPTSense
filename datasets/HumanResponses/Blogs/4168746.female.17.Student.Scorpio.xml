        Yesterday, there was so many things i was never told. Now i'm startin to learn. I feel i'm growin old...Cause yesterday's got nothin for me, old pictures that i'll always see. Time just fades the pages in my book of memories. Prayers in my pocket and no hand in destiny. Cause yesterday's got nothin for me, old pictures that i'll always see. Some things could be better, if we'd just let them be...         but anyways... I dont kno.. todays been kind of a eye opener for me. Yea, i think a lotta times that my life sucks, but ya kno... i have a lot of things that sum people dont.  Maybe i'm just selfish and a baby at times. Yea i'm stubborn ((ppl tell me that a lot)) ... hah.. how proud right?       But anyways, i kiinda got the job at the marion star.       Thiings with marcus are still the same      Things with trav are still the same.      Ummm big figh with my friend eric... ((which led to my eye opening or whatever))      Mom is doing okay after the surgery. She's sick a lot but i guess thats cause of her nervs and shit actin up. I guess she's really nervous about the results, but i'm thinkin that they will come back fine. Atleast i hope so.      Jen Phillips contacted me about senior girls wearin jerseys for the first game... of couse i'm in baaaby. lol. We buyin tee's for the 2nd game i guess.       Senior year... can't wait..

         This may never start, We could fall apart, And I'd be your memory, Lost your sense of fear, Feelings insincere, Can I be your memory.  So get back, back, back to where we lasted, Just like I imagine, I could never feel this way, So get back, back, back to the disaster, My heart's beating faster, Holding on to feel the same.  This may never start,  I'll tear us apart, Can I be your enemy,  Losing half a year, Waiting for you here, I'd be your anything, So get back, back, back to where we lasted, Just like I imagine, I could never feel this way, So get back, back, back to the disaster, My heart's beating faster, Holding on to feel the same.          Hmmm.... moms surgery was yesterday. They went in there and took out all the un-nessecary stuff that was in there i guess. i dont really kno i'm not a boob expert. But anyways, i'm up all early tryna to help her out. I guess the medicine and stuff made her very sick. She already threw up like 3 times... y-to tha-uck.      Walmart opens next week... so therefore i probably will be laid off for a couple weeks. Ugh, who knows... they might even just fire me. Wouldn't that be grrrreat.       I get paid today.. but i gotta save it until next week cause i'm going school shoppin... yea real interesting stuff in this entry riiight? I'll write more later...

        "The night will fall and the sun will rise. Just see the best as u close ur eyes. When u reach the top as u bottom out. But you'll understand what its all about. Nothing's ever what it seems. In ur life or in ur dreams. It doesnt make sense what can u do. So I wont try making sense of u."       I've came to the conclusion that life totally suCks.  I'm tiired of basically anything and everything in my life.    ok.. now that that's outta the way... heh      Lets see, what did i do today. Basically nothing. I went to KroGer to find out if i worked today. I coulda swore i was supposed too, but on my lil peice of paper that i write down my scheduale, it said i didn't. So i figured i would play it safe and go look. I came back home... did nothing for about another 2 hrs and then went over to my Maw's house. Hadn't been over there in a LONG time.  I took her a pic from my prom. Just felt like it i guess. I only stayed over there for like 45 minutes, it was quite boring and such.  So i came back home, and i've sat here ever since.       The Marion Star wrote me another email today. I guess i gotta set up this meetin pronto and see whats goin on. Hopefully they pay me good cause i kiinda need the money. Kinda? Hell, i need the money bad. I'm not gonna go into details cause its really no bodys business but mine...      Moms surgery is gettin closer and closer. Niice huh? She asked me today if i had told anybody about it.. i said no.. but i guess i coulda told her i told the whole internet. Eh well.       Ok, break down time... i miss Marcus like crazy. There i said it.      Have u ever had one of those days where u just wanna sit and cry.. and cry... and listen to music that wants to make u cry even more? Today is my day. Yea i kno "whine whine whine" but seriously, i hardly ever do this anymore or feel this way anymore.       Sitting here thinking    Not even blinking   Thinking blank ryhmes   Thinking bout time   Why'd u leave   Why do i plea   I miss you so much   i miss your touch   Think without reason   Its never the right season   i love my friiends   where will it end   i love you   What did u do   i begged you to stay   But u left anyway   I think...    i sink..   i live on.   -Me

       Ok... first off, i'd like to diss the people that took away the best online journals ever.  urlLink www.studentcenter.org . PEICE OF SHIT JOURNALS NOW. They took away any kinda colors and shit u could have. I dunno... they want it to look all bland and crap. Who knows what they were thinking on that one. If i woulda had more than only 9 entries i'd probably be a lil more upset than i even am now. haha.  I dont even know if this "blog" thing is gonna work out. Seems odd to me. Blog..what kinda word is that anyways...       But anyways  - how i like to do things - start out with a lil quote, part of a song, basically whatever i damn well feel like puttin for that day. So yea... on with today's real entry.     "There's somethin about ur love. That makes me weak. It knocks me off my feet. I dont mean to bore u with my troubles.. but i love you, i love you" - Jagged Edge and Donnell Jones 'Knocks me off my feet"           i'm reading this awesome book. "Tell Me Lies" by Jennifer Cruise... this  woman got sum talent lemme tellll you. shiiiiit, this girl got me hooked the first page. Hell, in the first to lines  the main character in the book ((maddie)) found sum black crotchless panties in her husbands car. Now come on...u  kno that would make u read on.  Go buy that book at wal-martm atleast thats where i bought it. $$2.93... for a 369 page book. COME ON NOW, wal-mart is the shiit. and i'm already on page 225 and i've only had the book 2 days. crazyness i tell ya.         MAn, i worked 1:30-10pm today. It sucked quite badly. hah. Atleast i worked with some halfway decent people. I be workin at kRogers grocery store as a bagger. Mike be runnin the floor tonight ((basically he the one tellin us what to do and when to go out on carts and when to clean & shit of that nature))... but anyways. He aint make me go on carts all damn day! i was lovin him for that.  But he had to leave at 8, and of course i was there for 2 more damn hours & that bastard Barry made me go out on carts as soon as he left. haha. i didn't mind tho, cause i hadnt been out there all day.      My next 2 or 3 checks be goin to school shit! I love me sum shoppin, i can't wait. Moms told me she isn't payin for anything this year, cause i'ma be a senior and since i gotta job she said it was my responsiblity. bullshiiiit. lol. i guess i got her on this one tho.       And before i forget. I saw Maw at work today! She came through. Damn, i didn't even notice her at first. DAMN. Thats how u kno u aint seen fam in awhile. I love her to death tho. She my momma. Always will be.      I watched the movie "Enough" yesterday ((you kno the one with jennifer lopez in it))... girl had it goin on i must say. It made me wanna take sum classes and beat the shit outta somebody. It'd do me some good. Get sum anger and hostility out.      Believe me, i got enough goin on for about 20 people. Moms got breast cancer, goes into surgery on weds. SuCkS AsS lemme tell you. Pops is still in the process of gettin the rest of his teeth pulled. And he got sum crazy shit goin on with that cause they got a lotta infection and they gotta scrape it out, and then put stitches in there. So you kno he be in bitch mode. Lets see.... i'll prolly lose my job within the next few weeks. Superwal-marts' food center is opening up about 200 yards from kroger. *tear*. hah. My brother had to quit his niiice job at the distribution center cause they tried to keep him from goin to his classes ((devRy university biatches)).  So he still tryin to find a job and he gotta fiance and a lil baby to take care of. My gangsta neice aaliyah. MY BABY GIRL! i love her to death. She sooo cute. She 4 months old now. Moms goin crazy with  takin pictures tho. That needs to stop. She got enough to give everyone in Marion 2 pics of that kiid. hah. i love her tho. Much love for them both actually... haha who knew.       Well enough for now.. my hands gettin a bit tiired.   Live it up.
