      ...of school. How interesting that I decided to skip the last half of the day, even though my friends decided they at least wanted to stay for Period 3. Ah well...my  afternoon teachers aren't expecting anyone, so I know I won't get in any trouble.  Drama (my one and only class today, come to think of it) was nice. People thought for some reason that I was in Grade 11, and were very surprised to hear I was in Grade 12. Jeez...the whole semester, and they had a skewed image of me. Thing is, that doesn't matter, because everyone in that class still thinks I'm a pretty nice guy regardless of my age or grade. It just goes to show that what counts is inside. There are friends I made in that class that I really hope to see again years and years from now.  Shoko, for example. She's an exchange student from Japan, and she performed in some of our Drama 20 plays this semester, and even wrote one herself. Her English is quite good. We all love her very much, and signed her Canada flag which she'll bring back to Japan with her next month. I'm determined, some way down the road, to have lunch with her in Japan sometime. It'll be nice.  Anyway, I've run out of time. (Damn library computers!) Maybe I'll keep writing into this post later. I sure can't do it from the school anymore.

      I don't have too much to say here... yet . I discovered yesterday that I will very likely be leaving for Inuvik on June 2nd. There, I will attempt to find work, by which means I will (hopefully)save enough money for a 15GB iPod and 12" PowerBook. (The order comes to about $3200 CDN.) My mother calls that place "the land of opportunity". By this she refers to the fact that since the cost of living is higher there because of its remote location, the pay is higher as well. It's a very good thing I have family to stay with, or I'd likely find it exceedingly hard to save that much money in a summer. What's the story behind the blog's title? What the hell is  Null ? Ehhh...I'll reveal the story in a future post. I suppose it's a good thing to isolate subjects so as to be able to make as many different posts as possible. The more specialized a post is, the more can be said about that one subject. After all, this is the Internet. I don't have to worry about space or time; if I want to talk about something else, I make a new post for it so the reader can read about one thing or another. Aaaiiiuuughhhh. I'd better stop rambling like a n00b and get something done. I dunno what. Anything.
