        His name was Gregorio, but he was "Tatay" to us kids. Like my mother, he was barely a teenager when Imperial Japanese forces invaded the Philippines, surviving the terrible years that followed, and witnessing atrocities that burned painfully forever into his memory.   He worked with his hands, running gigantic machines that printed magazines, newspapers,  komiks , and later on, pocket-sized versions of the New Testament. Years of working with printing presses made him stink of solvents, the lines of his hands and his face looked as if they were permanently etched with black ink. But as grit and grime seeped into his pores, his mind absorbed the knowledge of the printed word, making him some sort of blue-collar Plato. His discourses were legendary, lengthy and open to debate. Yet no one dared contest him. We were all deathly scared of him, of course; I knew I was. You don't want to see Tatay get angry. But when he showed tenderness, it was as sublime as witnessing a miracle.    When the mood suited him, he would talk about the works of  urlLink Nick Joaquin , who was his favorite author. Or, he would gingerly recount his boyhood experiences during the last world war, frequently pausing as if cautioning himself not to say too much. Later on, when I was much older, the tales he told became more detailed, and subsequently more gruesome. It was like his way of saying that I've grown up, and ready for the realities of the world.        He was also a proud man. Proud to the last. The last time I saw him, a recent stroke had paralyzed half of his body. He smiled when he recognized me, twisting his etched face into a contorted smile. But when I spoke of taking care of him and working to get him back on his feet again, his eyes flashed with the fury that froze my blood. His grunts were guttural and incomprehensible, but I understood every bit of it. He said, in so many words, "How dare you even think that you can take care of me? I raised you!"    Tatay died a year later. I berated myself for not showing any sign of grief during the burial, but I knew that if he were alive, he'd promptly tell me to stop crying and move on with my life.

        A colleague from  urlLink Batangas  recently confided to me that he thought I wasn't Filipino. He added that he was so surprised to learn that not only am I as Filipino as  urlLink chocnut , I was also born and raised in the islands. Now that's a common thing for Filipinos abroad:  I have been mistaken for Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, African-American, and Thai. As a people, we're a rich amalgam of different races and cultures which makes it difficult for everyone else to distinguish us from...well, from everyone else (never mind the "y'all look alike anyways" wisecrack that you hear from common-air breathing folk. As  urlLink MJ  would say, "That's ignorant!"). That, and the fact that Filipinos easily assimilate into the environment. If there is such a thing as Little Manila or Filipino Town in your neighborhood, you probably won't even notice it. There's no ornate arch, no bilingual street signs, no houses festooned with the Filipino flag. We probably live next door to you. What you'd probably notice is that the nurse who drives the nice sedan, or the the  cabana   boy who brought your cocktail had a distinct accent.   Back to my  Batangueno  colleague. He surmised that I may have lost the local accent because I've been living abroad for so long. Which isn't true. As far back as I can remember, my siblings and I (even when we were little kids running wild in the streets of Manila)spoke English sans any accent(and we don't pepper our sentences with "y'know?", "oh, yah?", and "really?", either). But that's not my point. My point is that one's accent is part of one's identity. It actually lends character to the speaker; it enriches the words, and even gives credibility to what that person is saying. Plenty of people have accents. The more cosmopolitan you get, the more you'll realize that accent is a proud signature that people carry with them. So, I casually told my colleague that having an accent is a good thing, and that having one shouldn't make anyone feel less of a speaker.    Now, grammar is another thing. Unless you're some waif from Yugoslavia on a modeling stint, or a hunk from Brazil trying to break into Hollywood (you see a pattern there?) good grammar is important. Because, what good is a bunch of "y'know?"s, "oh, yah?"s, and "fu-----"s strung together into a rudimentary sentence if you can't communicate your thoughts and ideas?

       urlLink    OKONOMIYAKI&nbsp; urlLink       Usually referred to as Japanese pancake, it's hardly analogous to the breakfast fare we usually drown with syrup; this one you drown either with mayonnaise or tonkatsu sauce, or both. Easy to prepare, and very tasty...skip the bonito flakes, though, if you hate that fishy taste.    INGREDIENTS  3 tbsp. cooking oil 2 cups cabbage, julienned 1/2 cup flour 1/4 kg lean pork, cut into thin strips 2 eggs 1/4 cup mayonnaise 2 tbsp tonkatsu sauce 1/4 cup bonito flakes  1. Mix together eggs, flour, and cabbage in a bowl to form a thick, pasty batter. 2. Heat the oil in a frying pan. 3. Pour about a cup of the batter into a flat circular form in the pan. Then put the pork on top. Flip to cook the other side. 4. Top with mayonnaise, tonkatsu sauce, and bonito flakes. Makes 2-3 pancakes.

         This war was supposed to be as quick and glorious as the first one. Now, I will leave the debates, the theories, the analyses, the whys and wherefores of this war to the experts and pundits who do that kind of thing for a living. Although, I'm sure, they're at a loss right now, same as me.     Memorial Day is upon us, bringing with it the obligatory three-day weekend. While its solemn message asks us to commemorate those who gave up their lives upon the altar of a grateful nation, it also brings up the sad fact that right now, at this very moment, our boys are dying out there. Never mind the Jessica Lynches, the Abu Ghraib prison photos, and the leadership's staunch refusal to take command responsibility. The fire of the altar of freedom doth burn bright, fueled by the blood, sinew, and bone of those who choose to. So go ahead and enjoy the weekend. It is not sacrilege to pop open a cold one and gorge one's self on so much grilled meat - heck, I'm sure the boys would be happy to see that their sacrifices were not in vain.   As far as the war goes, I leave you with this question: What would Thomas Hamill do?

         I am not familiar with the works of  urlLink Mike Maniquiz , but this piece, which was published on the December 7, 2003 issue of the  urlLink Philippine Panorama , caught my attention:   We should have turned right    We're lost in winter. Outside the passenger side window trees had never looked as worn as they did that season. Uncovered of their leaves, they approached wear.  The confessions that need an ear: some  Tagalog  words now escape her while others have gained resplendence. At a friend's house she said she heard someone say  tahan na   to a crying child  and knew it was memory calling her back.  Tahan na  , or  hush now , from which could have been derived  tahanan  , where one lives, where one stays, one's home.  Her father last said those words to her right before she left Manila, she recalled, leaning back behind the wheel the way people  often times do when the place finally becomes familiar.

         It almost seemed as if this week would never end. My shift partner and I were definitely earning our paychecks as we tackled the workload like desensitized automatons. Even our phone etiquette was reduced to a stream of staccato "yes,sir-no,sir-right away, sir". The way we've been running our shift, you'd think the analyzers have come to life and taken over, utilizing us techs as mere extensions of their utilitarian function.   Until we get hungry, of course. Then we dash over to the cafeteria, wolf down some grease burgers and salty fries (ain't it ironic that the best grease burger joint in Okinawa is located inside a hospital?), chase them down with either iced coffee or coke, then rush back to work. We've resigned to the fact, after each meaty burp, that we've become as bad as truckers.   As tonight winds to an end (by "end" I mean that we've pulled our shift; specimens are still pouring in, waiting to be processed) my partner remarked that after work she's going out to get a drink. I roared a hearty "Amen!", but didn't really mean it. Because I know that after work I'm going straight home to Jenn, Alex, and Joshua, and savor the remains of the day with them.

        I was really looking forward to Alexander's school presentation today in celebration of Asia-Pacific Heritage Month. His class is going to do a bit on New Zealand, and the boys are going to perform a  haka , a "taunting" dance originated by the Maoris of New Zealand.The ancient Maoris were cannibals, but unlike other tribes who practice cannibalism to honor the spirits of their fallen opponents, the Maoris eat their enemies to humiliate them. The haka involves synchronised posturing, grunting, chest beating, and the grotesque act of sticking their tongues out to signify that they're going to  urlLink eat  you. A long time ago, Maoris with big bellies were jokingly accused of making a meal out of people who crossed them. Nowadays, New Zealand athletic teams start off their matches with a haka, although I'm sure they don't follow up on the feasting on human flesh afterwards.    Alex and his class didn't disappoint. Thanks to Jenn's hard work on the costumes, and the childrens' seemingly unstoppable energy, the show was superb. Alex and the other boys were trying to look menacing during the haka, but ended up looking adorable. Too bad I won't be able to catch the encore presentation later today.

          urlLink Looks like Typhoon Nida decided not to hit Japan.  This is great news, actually. Alex and his class got to go to the zoo, along with Jenn, who's volunteering as chaperone.Even Joshua's coming - he's volunteering to keep the wild animals at bay. This trip has previously been cancelled, so you know the kids are really excited that the weather cleared up.  I'm still navigating semi-blindly through this blog, but after browsing the tutorials and several trial runs, I think I'm getting the hang of it. Posting photographs is still a working progress, and I haven't figured out how the comment section works. So until then, photos will include a screen capture of my computer screen; as far as the comments go, put your name in with the comment text  ( thanks, Dad - the "love" part was a nice touch ;) )  - that is, unless you wish to remain anonymous.   An afterword on typhoons:       It used to be that typhoons in the Philippines are  always  given female names. The common explanation to that is that typhoons, like women:  - are very indecisive to a fault, and change their minds constantly;  - wreak havoc when they let loose their fury.   How sexist is that?

         According to Jenn, there are four typhoons brewing over the warm, black waters of the Pacific, the biggest already overwhelming Manila, and poised to enter Okinawan "area of responibility" by Wednesday night, Ryukyu time. The Air Force has calmly posted a TC-3 warning; elsewhere portable water tanks are being deployed and crates of MREs are being delivered to the barracks...just in case. The  "mosangs"   (gossip hounds) at work kept repeating over and over that this one's a super typhoon, so you better stock up on diapers, infant formula, and instant ramen noodles. I shrug my shoulders and continued to monitor the test results that the phlegmatic Coulter Axsym blood analyzer was spitting out. I've weathered enough typhoons to know that if it doesn't kill you, it'll just annoy you. Nearby, Toguchi-san, my Okinawan colleague and friend, was too preoccupied to worry about the incoming "super typhoon". Row after row of urine tubes sat indifferently as he fumbled over his dog-eared day planner. Finally, he summoned enough courage to tell me what was on his mind. Apparently, his wife is alone at home and running a fever, so he wants to check on her. Oh, stoic one, thy bushido spirit is well-meaning but wasted in this workplace that places little value on your culture. I promptly teased him about not taking care of his wife and told him to take the afternoon off. Taking my cue, my supervisor concurred, adding that I have to cover Toguchi-san's workload. That, of course, goes without saying, but we enacted that little theatrics to show Toguchi-san that he need not worry about leaving his post.    The downpour was becoming heavier and more frequent, minus the heavy winds that preclude a typhoon. I made it home to find Jenn and the kids getting ready for bed (she practically painted the entire interior of the house, plus squeezing in some needlework for the Maori costumes that Alex and his class will be wearing for their school presentation; that AND making dinner, and taking care of the kids). Jenn doesn't think that the typhoon will hit us head-on; her only concern is that the school trip to the local zoo might be cancelled again because of the rain. While I was at work worrying if the cranky complete blood count analyzer was going to accept the current control reagents, Jenn was balancing her time between school and home, worrying about the welfare of the next generation.

       Don't get me wrong. I am very much a people person. And a Filipino. I do have a pet peeve when dealing with people, especially with people who, because English is not their first language, resort to a script, or a collection of canned responses to create the illusion that they are communicating with you. For example:  Me:   "Good morning. I am in the process of separating from the Navy. As per your  message, I went ahead and scheduled for my physical exams, put out a request chit to separate from the Navy, and scheduled a TAPP class." Now, is there anything else that I can do to hurry this up?"  Desk jock (Filipino):  "Good morning. Congratulations on your decision to separate from active duty. Have you already filed a request to separate from the Navy?"  Me:  "Yes...I just told you that."  Desk jock:  "Good, good. Have done your separation physical?"  Me:  "N-no, but I already have one scheduled (I told you that already)".  Desk jock:  "What about your TAPP..."  Me:  "Look...I did all the tasks you mentioned in your message. What I need to know is this: is there anything else that I can do, so that I'm not sitting around twiddling my thumbs, not knowing there's still a lot of requirements that I need to attend to for..."  Desk jock:     "Gee...take a chill pill! (Canned response #1) I'm just going through the checklist (first evidence that he's communicating via a script). Looks like we'll just have to wait for the request chit to get approved."  Me:  "Okay. So you're saying that we can't do anything without that approved chit?"  Desk jock:   "Have you done your separation physical yet?"  Me:  "No, I already mentioned that. It's scheduled for tomorrow, if you must know."  Desk jock:    "Sweet!" (canned response #2). What about TAPP class?"  Me:  (turning green and ripping shirt off my chest) "Listen: Already put in the request for separation, scheduled my physical, going to TAPP class. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT I NEED TO DO, OR AM I JUST WASTING MY TIME LISTENING TO YOU READ FROM YOUR SCRIPT?"  Desk jock : "Chill, Bill! (canned response #3) As our customer, you are our priority (second evidence that he's communicating via a script). When are you separating?"  Me:    27 July, 2004.  Desk jock:  "Whew, that's just around the corner...have you already put in a chit?"  Me:   "Chit for what?"  Desk jock:  "Duuuude! (canned response #4) To separate from the Navy!"  Me:  "I - NEED - TO - SPEAK - TO - YOUR  - SUPERVISOR."  Desk jock:  "Sorry, he's off today."

        Okay, the title was a little too misleading. There is, after all, just Jenn, Alex, Josh, and myself; the cats Andrew and (the)Mack...and the resident Okinawan poltergeist that constantly manifests around the house.    I'm no believer in the paranormal, despite growing up in a culture where fairies, ogres and lesser imps cohabit with mortals; and where the visitation of spirits, whether they be benign or maleficient, almost always leave tactile trails. The Okinawan ghost culture strike me as just a variant of the Filipino ghost culture back home - different names, same stories. Still, it's hard to readily dispel the possibility that there might indeed be spirits residing in the house, especially when things indeed go bump. Nothing serious, of course - just things falling off (gravity?) and moisture appearing in the strangest of places(leaks?). Jenn, however, has witnessed ladles flying off the chili pot, among other things. Anyway, it appears to be relatively harmless, so we kinda leave it alone.   I've forgotten all about it, until one evening, after seeing what she thought was a small manifestation, Jenn casually "told" whatever it was that it's more than welcome to tag along when we go back to the States.  How odd, I thought. Later that evening, though, I caught myself mumbling the same thing, and even casually offered one of the ceramic shi-shi dogs as its "home". I wonder if we need to declare that at Customs...

       "A time to build up, a time to break down"*  It's been decided, since last week, that we're trading the charmed life we had in Okinawa for the charmed life we'll have in Illinois. Funny,how strangely some people react when confronted by a force so terrible that it'll alter their lives forever. In his book "The Longest Day", Cornelius Ryan mentioned that a Wehrmacht officer billeted in Normandy was so awed by the site of the approaching Allied invasion force that he took out his easel and started painting. Well, Jenn and I didn't do anything strange like that, but we did throw a barbecue that Saturday, together with our next-door neighbor Josh and Heidi. Also, there's beer in the fridge. We never stock beer. Anyway, I popped open a San Miguel Pale Pilsner (the Philippine flagship brand) and took a swig. Then it dawned on me - fifteen years ago, in Manila, I was nursing a bottle of San Miguel and thinking to myself that it's probably going to be my last chance to taste the local brew, because I just got accepted into the US Navy. I smiled, and was very comforted (or was that small dose of alcohol potent enough to lull me into a carefree stupor?). It was as if Jenn knew, and had bought me San Miguel Beer to remind me that Life has come full circle. One adventure ends, to make room for another adventure to begin. Leave it to Jenn. She's the one constant in my everchanging world. So, filled with those thoughts, I finished my beer, and proceeded to burn some chicken on the grill...         * There is a season (Turn, turn, turn) by Pete Seeger.

       Apparently, an earthquake which registered 4.1 on the Richter scale shook Northern Illinois early Monday, and was felt by residents from as far as Wisconsin, Missouri, Michigan and Iowa. Although we didn't feel it here in Mootown, Gramma Worth reported that her house in nearby McHenry rattled a bit. Fortunately, she went through the ordeal unscathed, and didn't report any property damage.  Hmmm...  Dad did ask Jenn to bring some of that hot and humid Okinawan weather back to Illinois. Now for those not familiar with tribal lore, Dad is also known as Ger the Rain god, he who attracts precipitation and takes it with him wherever he goes. Jenn, his daughter, is a deity in her own right, possessing the gift of "seeing" typhoons and foretelling their path. Between the two of them, did they attract a tremor native to Japan and somehow manage to channel it over here? One could only wonder. Oh, and by the way, Elaine, wife to Ger and Jenn's mother, is no mere mortal herself: she can harness electricity and can fry the circuits of any computer that displeases her by mere touch.  Oh, to be among divinity...

         Yesterday was, without exaggeration, the most stressful,hectic, godawful day of the week. Our plane tickets were ready for pick up over at the Personnnel Office (site of the now famous Battle of Kadena) - however, there is the unresolved question of what to do with the van. We can`t check out without showing them any proof that our vehicle was indeed sold, or consigned for the scrap heap. Simply abandoning it would incur numerous heavy penalties, a mistake committed so many times that the military wised up and established this iron-clad rule: you can`t leave the island until your vehicle is either sold or junked. Well, since there were no takers, we decided to junk the van. That in itself was a paperwork-filled hurdle, involving an Okinawan troll and more Air Force red tape. Thank goodness Heidi was gracious enough to loan us her van. Good ol` Heidi. She`s always got our backs covered.    So, finally done with our quest and with nothing else to do, we headed back to the hotel to freshen up and get ready for dinner. In the elevator, Jenn pointed out a flyer advertising steak dinner and live musical performers at the hotel restaurant. So once more, its steak for dinner.    The rib eye steak was very good, and grilled just right. The performers, unfortunately, seemed like leftovers from a Vietnam-era USO tour. The two elderly men who made up the show provided musical entertainment with their acoustic guitars with renditions of folksy, if dated favorites. I think only Jenn and I (and the hotel manager)remember the old tunes; the rest of the dinner crowd seemed lost in the nostalgia and inevitable humor of it all.(Alex and Joshua seemed entertained, though) After we polished off dinner we scampered out of the restaurant while the the two performers filled the air with doleful sounds of some 60`s ballad. Oh, to be overseas...

      We used to be Tuesday night regulars at Sam`s Cafe, because that used to be all-you-can-eat fish and chips night. But when they took that off their menu, we strayed off to look for better foraging.  Tonight was different, of course. Stuck at the Hotel Grand Mer and dreading another overpriced meal at their only restaurant, we ventured off to Kadena Air Force Base to grab a bite at Jack`s Place, an old establishment famous for their steak. As luck would have it, the restaurant had an electrical problem, causing them to shut down for the day. So, we headed over to Sam`s Cafe.  Now, Sam`s Cafe is part of the Sam`s chain of restaurants famous in Okinawa for their steak. Anyone who`s been to Okinawa would attest that while the question of which place serves the best steak is subjective, Sam`s wins the prize for best restaurant (the English speaking staff is a plus for the American clientele, of course). Each of the eight restaurants is built around a theme; Sam`s Cafe, as the name suggests, is made up to look like a 50`s diner. Familiar rock and roll songs from the greats, as well as renditions by local talents provide a pleasing background to blend in with the table chatter. Framed lithographs of movie stars augment the wallpaper, and artifacts from postwar Okinawa are set out like knick knacks. There is even an ornate  sorbetes  (ice cream) cart from the Philippines among the collection (how it got here is anybody`s guess).  Well, we came for steak, so steak we ordered. Waitresses clad in sailor outfits promptly brought our food: the boys had tenderloin steak which came with soup, salad, fries, rice, pasta, vegetables, and ice cream; Jenn got teriyaki steak and chicken cordon bleu; I opted for the rib eye steak and red snapper. To say that the food wasn`t good would be inaccurate. But be it boon or bane, the food seemed like an extension of the 50`s theme. The meat was good and marbled, dripping in fat and flavor. The fish was buried in cheese, mushrooms, and butter. Everything had cholesterol written all over it, as if obesity, heart disease, and dieting have not yet entered the American psyche. Even the drink that came with the children`s dinner was carbonated soda - although that hardly causes raised eyebrows, most parents today choose not to serve sugary, caffeinated beverages to their kids. A man seated two tables away was smoking while enjoying dinner with his wife and two little children - was he just completing the 50`s ambiance, or was he just plain stupid?  We consumed the meal, fat and all. Then we headed back to the serenity of the hotel.

         Built during the heydays of Japan`s economic boom (guess which decade that was: self-help books on the Japanese psyche and how it will improve business are being hawked everywhere, as well as the words  Japan  and  Japanese  appearing endlessly in countless pop songs), the hotel was built in the love hotel district of Awase to attract a classier, more family-oriented clientele. Unfortunately for them, the Japanese bubble economy burst, leaving the hotel without any investors.    Decades later, a new set of investors bought the hotel and started construction again. And what a deal that turned out to be for us. The military flea hotels were booked, so we were recommended this place. The amenities are nice, and the food, of course, is outrageously expensive! But if the Navy is picking up the tab...    We had dinner over at the hotel with our next door neighbor Heidi and her son Michael. After browsing through the dinner menu, we opted for the lunch selection, because it is just too darn ridiculous to pay twenty five dollars for one meal, Navy reimbursement or otherwise. The burgers on the menu, however, were described as open-faced, so we assumed that it is probably salisbury steak served on a piece of bread (what do they do with the rest of the bun?). Well, Alex and Michael really wanted burgers, but would not even consider eating it with a knife and fork. So, we spoke to the waitress and asked if we could get a slice of bread to put over the open faced sandwich. The manager was called in, who promptly explained that the burger comes with a full bun, with the top part of the bun set to the side so you can pile on the garnish that comes with it - thus, in some weird classy restaurant parlance -  open faced . That established, we ordered the burgers for Alex and Michael. Joshua had the ten-dollar macaroni and cheese.

        Well, the movers came last Saturday and took everything away. The four Okinawan guys moved like demons possesed, specially since super typhoon Dianmu was nipping at their heels. They finished just in time for Jenn to close and tape up the front door. Shortly afterwards, the typhoon unleashed its fury.   We're checking in to a nice resort hotel for our last week here in Okinawa (hey, the Navy's paying for it!). Maybe a few last minute trips, and farewells, and we're out of here...

        I've been obessesing on this move, as per usual. Like Noah, I've been cataloguing   every item   in the house to make sure that they're all accounted for, and that nothing gets left behind. Jenn, of course, is more realistic. Items of very little value (like trinkets from the hundred-yen store) need not be "declared" on the shipping list, according to her. Still, I keep at it, making this either one of the most successful moves in military housing history, or the worst logistical maneuver in military housing history.   Today, the movers came to pack up and move items designated for unaccompanied baggage - clothes, toys, professional items. Not surprisingly, it two them less than half an hour to haul those items away. The real challenge will be the main event on Saturday, when they pack away everything else. To make matters more interesting, a typhoon looms over the horizon, expected to make landfall  this Saturday . Jenn's superpower senses are tingling - she fears that the typhoon will cause the movers to cancel. And to top it off,the  tombos  (dragonflies) have been flying low. Hmmm, well see what happens.

         I've never been an intuitive person, relying heavily on my five senses to navigate this world. And, even though Jenn has repeatedly demonstrated her other-wordly powers of mapping the path of typhoons and foretelling the immediate future, I scornfully blow it off by echoing the skepticism of a certain  urlLink smuggler : "Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid!"    Anyway, I woke up this morning with quite a start, as if there was something that needed attention, and fast. Sitting up, I closed my eyes, cleared my mind, and attempted to reach out...but what is it? Is Timmy stuck in the well? Is there a giant wooden horse parked up front? After a brief moment I gave up and directed my attention to the more tactile concerns at hand: putting the dishes away, routing the paperwork for my check out, finding a duffus who will buy the van. Perhaps there is sufficient reason to jump out of bed and get an early start. Up, up, and awaaaaaaaaay...

                         a one-act Opera buffa.      Dramatis Personae:  Billy Budd - Reluctant sailor getting out of the Navy. Jenny - Billy Budd's wife Desk Jock Jim - Personnel clerk Chief Jiminy - Personnel office middle management Chief Paradise - Personnel office middle management  Chief Eerie - Personnel office middle management The Master Gunnery Sergeant - Paralegal officer The Master Chief - Personnel office supervisor                                                          Desk Jock Jim  (via e-mail): Congratulations on your separation from the Navy. Since you were recruited in the Philippines, we are going to fly you and your family back to that lovely subtropical island nation, BECAUSE THAT'LL SAVE THE NAVY SOME MONEY. If you choose to fly back to the States, you may do so, but you'll have to pay for your fare.  Billy Budd : What kind of crap is that? I'm talking to a Legal Officer!  (Ten minutes later, at the Legal Office)  The Master Gunnery Sergeant : You're correct indeed sir, that is pure, unadulterated crap. Tell whomever's handling your case that they had better unscrew themselves and fly you and your family back to the States at government expense.  Bily Budd : That's what I said!     (Later, at the Kadena Personnel Office)  Desk Jock Jim : I'm sorry, Billy, but my chiefs said that you have no other option.  Billy Budd : Well, I just spoke to a Marine paralegal officer that says otherwise.  Desk Jock Jim : Is that so? Well, put him on the phone and I'll talk to him. (While Billy Budd fumbles with the phone, Jenny Budd is confronted by the Chiefs)  Chief Jiminy : (leaning back on his chair)Sorry, Mrs. Budd, but them's da rules.  Jenny Budd : Look at me! I'm an American, for chrissakes! The Navy flew me in here, they oughta fly me out!  Chief Eerie : Calm down, ma'am...you made me pee my pants!  Chief Paradise : I need to talk to your husband, ma'am. Why don't you step out and call him in? (Enter Billy Budd)  Billy Budd : Let's look at this logically, Chief Paradise. You are about to send my wife and my kids, three American citizens by birth, to the Philippines. Don't get me wrong, they loved it the last we came over to visit, but they need to go home: TO THEIR HOME.     Chief Paradise : (shaking his head) The rules are clear, Billy.  Billy Budd : How could you be so myopic as to focus on the rules you keep citing, without even looking to see if it does apply to my situation? I spoke to a  Marine paralegal who says for you to check the...  Chief Paradise : (rudely interrupting)He's a goddamn Marine! What does he know about Navy rules?  Billy Budd : Last time I checked, (except for specific trivial cases) the Navy and the Marine Corps fall under the same rules.  Chief Paradise : No they don't. (Billy Budd steps out of the office and goes straight to the supervisor's office)  Billy Budd  (after presenting his case): ...and furthermore, you need to tell your Chiefs that that they were disrespectful to my wife.  The Master Chief : (in calm low voice) We will deal with that issue later. In the meantime, we'll take care of the crisis at hand. Tell me, what information did that Marine paralegal provide you?  Billy Budd : He said for you to look into the JFTR (Joint Federal Travel Regulations). (The Master Chief waves his hand at the Chiefs who scamper away. Minutes later, they come back with a copy of the JFTR.)  Chief Paradise : Y-you were right, Billy Budd. The JFTR clearly states that it is our responsibility to fly you and your family back to the United States, at government cost. I apologize for the misunderstanding. I didn't know about this JFTR.  Chief Jiminy : Neither did I. I'm sorry, Billy Budd. It won't happen again.  Chief Eerie : Out of curiosity, why are you getting out of the Navy?  Billy Budd : No disrespect, but that's none of your business, Chief! I didn't come here to make small-talk with you!  Chief Eerie : (in a whiny, mousy voice) Oh, no...I peed my pants again!  Billy Budd : (in a grim voice, to the Chiefs)You all need to apologize to my wife.  The Chiefs : (in unison) Oh, we will, we will! (scampers out.)  The Master Chief : You see, Billy Budd? Crisis averted. (draws a big sigh)And all this because Desk Jock Jim didn't know how to do his job.  Billy Bud : With all due respect, but neither do the Chiefs.  The Master Chief : I am painfully aware of that. It's a mistake, that's all. (The Chiefs return from groveling at Mrs. Budd's feet. At this point, Billy Budd assumes a cocky tone)  Billy Budd : I work in Medical. If I make a mistake, it could mean the death of a patient!  The Master Chief : True. Fortunately, here in Personnel, we do not deal with peoples' lives.  Billy Budd : Fortunately, indeed! Because with the level of competency that your staff showed today, there'd be a lot of dead patients here!  The Master Chief : Y-yeeees. (gestures at the Chiefs to start groveling again)  Chief Jiminy : A-again, we apologize.   Chief Paradise : Yes, yes. We apologize. We'll take care of your paperwork right now!  Chief Eerie : Would you and your wife like anything? Coffee? Tea? My pants?  Jenny Budd : Just get the paperwork rolling so we can get out of here! (Minutes later, Desk Jock Jim hands Billy Budd a new set of orders - this time, indicating that the entire family will be flown back to the States at government expense).  Desk Jock Jim : Again, we're sorry...  Billy Budd : Can it, bub. (The Budds walk away from the personnel office with smirks on their faces, savoring the small victory over bureaucracy, stupidity, and the Navy. The office building is left intact, but it might as well be razed to the ground, because the people who work inside it were beaten in their own game.)

         First of all, let me just start off by saying that I have very little time left on my military service here on-island - I am, in effect, a short timer. I'm so short that I need a ladder to put my shoes on. I'm so short that my boss' whining doesn't even faze me. I'm so short that although they've included my name in the new gate guard roster for August, I didn't even bother to let them know that I'm gone by the end of June. I'm so short that... well, you get the picture.    Anyway, the hospital bandwidth doesn't support G-mail. As they would say in the Air  Force, "What kind of crap is that?"

         This morning, Jenn and I scheduled dates for the government packers to show up and cart our stuff away. For me, this is always the worst part of the move. All your worldly belongings get boxed up and shipped, all the while fearing the possibility that they might not make it to the other side in one piece. Jenn, curiously, is the exact opposite of the moving spectrum: she loves unpacking stuff, likening it to the joys of opening Christmas presents. Anyway, we both agreed to involve the kids in choosing which items go in what pile, thus:  - accompanied baggage, or the items we take with us on the flight home;  - unaccompanied baggage, or stuff that'll be shipped express to our new destination;  - household goods, or items that'll traverse the Pacific ocean via slow boat;  - junk, items that we no longer need, or cannot take with us back to the States.    Jenn remarked that she's not feeling any moving-related stress yet. What about me? I'm balls-to-the-walls, sweat-pumps-in-effect,  urlLink asthma-hound chihuahua mode  gonnagonutsanyminutenow.  Call me crazy, but I fear that any glitch in this entire operation reflects on my ability as team leader (insert canned laughter here). And nothing manifests that fear more eloquently as in the way I packed the kids' toys. As early as a month before the move, I've packed and sealed most of the toys, and sequestered them into the confines of the spare room. Ironically,  that  spare room, which was once designated as the playroom, has become a prison pen of sorts for all the playthings. No one is allowed to take out any of the toys. Any toy found outside the toy  gulag  is condemned to the rubbish heap, or ownership transferred to the kids next-door. Anyone caught dealing in the unauthorized transport of toys from one area of the house to another is subjected to manic speeches of you-wanna-lose-that-toy-by-leaving-it-behind-why-don't-I-save-you-that-trouble-and-just-give-it-away administered in Hitleresque contortions performed by myself. This is specially true for the toys with numerous miniscule parts and accesories, like LEGO and GI Joe. ("You think Duke would be happy when he realizes that his 9mm pistol and AR-15 assault rifle is missing because you decided to play with it outside?" - oh, the horror, oh, the madness). Jenn has already pointed out the flaws in my method, but I was too busy looking for the tenth plastic missile that belongs to the GI Joe Night Attack Chopper to even pause and think. Ah, what twisted tales will Alex and Joshua tell their therapists. So while Nick's lunatic wagon rolls along, Jenn managed to singlehandedly throw a fresh coat of paint on all the walls of the room.  Epilogue:   I've realized the errors of my ways. Battling Wehrmacht troopers and the undead in  "Return to Castle Wolfenstein" helps a lot, too.

         Although I'm not picky when it comes to food, and will eat anything edible (provided that it is properly served for consumption - Fear Factor execs, take note!), there are a few delicacies that I absolutely love having.  Adobong pusit  is one of them. Here's a recipe, in case you invite me over for dinner (ha-ha):   Ingredients:    1 lb fresh common squid ( Loligo vulgaris ) 1/2 cup white vinegar 1 tbsp cooking oil 10 cloves garlic 1 small onion, chopped 2 medium tomatoes, chopped salt and pepper to taste  Clean the squids thoroughly: if you haven't done it before, be sure to wash them in cold water, pull out the thin transparent membrane from inside the head, bleed out the "ink" by slitting open the eyes. Place them in a saucepan. Add vineggar, 5 garlic cloves, salt and pepper. Simmer until they turn into tender pink morsels. If you're cooking large squids, cut them into bite-size pieces. If they're smaller (three inches or less), just pull off the heads from the bodies. Crush and saute the remaining garlic cloves with a little oil. Add and saute onions, add and saute tomatoes. Add the cooked squid, along with the broth they were cooked in. Simmer for 5-7 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve with plenty of white rice.

         Okay, this is probably the last time that I'll write about good grammar. It's a lost cause, especially when the  urlLink  supremo    himself is guilty. If a person can utter those sentences and still be the most powerful man in the universe, then (like I've said before)good grammar is not necessarily a requirement for success. Then again, maybe it's the fault of his speech writers. If that's the case, my argument is still moot, because I'm sure those people make good money writing all that material for Dubya's standup act. Consider:  1. "I'm honored to shake the hand of an Iraqi citizen who had his hand cut off by Saddam Hussein."  2. "My views are one that speaks to freedom."  3. "We had a chance to visit with Teresa Nelson, who's a parent, and a mom or a dad."  4. "Security is the essential roadblock to achieving the road map to peace."  5. "It's very important for folks to understand that if there's trade, there's commerce."  6. "It's your money, you paid for it."  7. "I know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully."  8. "We'll let our friends be the peacemakers, and the great country called America will be the pacemakers."  9. "I think we agree, the past is over."  10. "Will the highways on the internet become more few?"

        So you've been in the Navy for a big chunk of your adult life serving as a Hospital Corpsman (or medic, for you Army folks), and you need to move on. Of course, every once in a while, nostalgia sets in and you pine for the good old days. Well, here's a list of things you can do to help you reminesce:  1. Buy two sets of wardrobe: one black, one white. Wear the white outfit in the Summer and the black one in the Winter. Don't bother pressing them even if they're wrinkled; don't wear a belt; and don't shine your shoes.  2. Stock up on Ibuprofen. When somebody tells you that they're not feeling good, regardless of what's ailing them, offer them a couple of tablets.  3. Pretend like you know so much more about medicine than doctors. Also, develop a disdain for nurses.  4. Impress/annoy those around you by pointing out mistakes in medical-related TV shows like "E.R.", or even "M.A.S.H."  5. Use operating room scrubs for pajamas.  6. Stage an impromptou surgical setup (complete with sterile field) whenever your spouse or child come up to with a scratch or minor cut.  7. While watching war movies, repeatedly point out that there'd be less casualties in the field had they deployed Hospital Corpsmen.  8. Confuse your friends by associating yourself first with the seafaring life of a sailor, then switching to stories of roughing it out in the jungle with the Marines.  9. Wear military boots to work, but don't clean them. As a matter of fact, make them look as scuzzy as possible.  10. Introduce yourself as "Doc", and start giving out medical advice.

        Coming by way of India, curry has become a regular on the Japanese menu, creating an industry of curry houses and curry products. It's the one meal that the Japanese eat with a spoon: although I have seen old people stick their faces into steaming bowls of rice and curry, rapidly raking in mouthfuls with their  ohashi  as if their hands have suddenly developed delirium tremens, you're more than likely get a large spoon with your order of curry. Also, instead of being served in a bowl (with the curry poured over the rice) it is usually served on a plate, the sticky whiteness of the rice offsetting the liquidy brown of the curry.   There's a lot of curry houses here in Okinawa, each with its own secret formula. The  family favorite, of course, is  urlLink Coco's ichibanya  (we go to the one on Route 58, just outside Camp Foster). I've been trying to duplicate their distinct style (which has a thin,soupy consistency as compared to other restaurants that serve theirs gravy-thick and burnt-brown), and just recently got the hang of it. So here it is, curry, ichibanya-style:   INGREDIENTS  S&B Golden curry sauce mix. It's gotta be this, or the whole operation falls flat. Oil, 1 tablespoon Onion, 1/2 cup, chopped or sliced thin. Pork, lean, 1 cup, sliced thin or cubed. Water Brown sugar Salt  1. Heat a sauce pan, pour in the oil, and saute the onions. 2. Add the pork, salt moderately. Cook until they start to brown. 3. Drop the heat to medium-low. Break the curry mix (which come in blocks, like chocolate) into little pieces and mix in.  4. As the curry starts to melt, start adding water, starting with one cup. 5. When the curry is totally melted, add brown sugar sparingly, until it suits your taste. At this point, you can add more curry, more water, or more brown sugar.  6. Drop the heat to low, and simmer for 15-20 minutes. 7. Serve with white rice.    Some people like their curry spicy, so feel free to add red hot chili peppers (or any incendiary of your choice)if you wish. Also, you can add vegetables (diced potatoes, carrots, or asparagus spears) and meat (chicken, beef, shrimp). Coco's serve theirs like pizzerias serve their pies - you can add as many "toppings" as you like.   By the way, they have Coco's ichibanya in Hawaii, too.

         It's pouring here in Okinawa. Dark clouds loom overhead like ominous gods, releasing torrents on the hapless mortals below. It brings with it a nice feeling, though. Everything seems so fresh and clean, even the slick, coral-dust covered streets.    I was on my way out to brave the downpour when my colleague Toguchi-san, who was shielding himself with a huge umbrella, came running in. Without a "Hey," or a " Nani? (what's up?)"  he folded the umbrella and handed it to me. As grateful as I was, I couldn't help but wonder about all those umbrellas that you see outside  combinis  (convenient stores) and restaurants. Are umbrellas here "community property", so once you're done with it, you hand it to the next person who needs it, or leave it outside public establishments and await the next beneficiary? Are there only so many umbrellas floating around Okinawa, passing hands so that it benefits not just one person, but the entire village? Is it the same way with bicycles? Because I see them everywhere, too - untethered by locks and there for the taking. Anyway, I did my errand, and returned the umbrella to Toguchi-san. He feigned a mild surprise, as if he hasn't seen that umbrella before. I effected a slight bow, mumbled  "Domo arigato, Toguchi-sama" , and walked away.

        Leaving the Navy can be difficult for some, especially for those who have savored life at sea. It need not end there, of course - salty sea dogs can wax nostalgic from the list below. Avast, mateys!    1. Replace the closet door with a curtain, and sleep on one of the shelves. Tell members of your household that as soon as you fall asleep, have one of them whip open the curtain, shine a flashlight in your eyes, and mumble, "Sorry, wrong bunk."  2. Renovate your bathroom. Install metal panels for walls and lower the shower head to chest level. When you take your shower, be sure to shut the water off while soaping. If you notice anyone taking a shower for more than five minutes, yell out, "Secure that Hollywood shower, mate. This ain't the Holiday Inn!"  3. Don't watch TV except for late night movies. Or, have your family vote on which movie to watch, then show a different one.  4. Make up your family menu a week ahead of time without checking what food you have in the cupboards or the refrigerator. Wake up in the middle of the night  EVERYNIGHT  and eat peanut butter and jelly on stale bread. Or, eat canned ravioli or canned soup,  UNHEATED  straight out of the can.  5. Set the alarm on your clock to go off at random times during the night. As soon as the alarm goes off, jump out of your bed (which is a closet shelf), get dressed as fast as you can, run out to the yard and break out the garden hose.  6. Every so often, fill the bathtub with water, throw your cat in, and yell, "Man overboard! Ship recovery!" Instruct your family to gather in the bathroom to make sure that they're not the one drowning, then proceed to rescue the cat.  7. Set your electric fan to "High". Have your family splash water on your face as you struggle to peer through your binoculars.  8. If your spouse tells you to do something, repeat every word of what she said, and follow it with "Aye!"  9. Once a month, pick a major appliance, take it apart and put it back together again.  10. Invite at least 85 people that you don't particularly like to come live with you for three to six months.

         urlLink Apparently, Bill Cosby also has opinions about grammar.  The gist of his inflammatory discourse is that good grammar equals professionalism. That is true, although I would like to add that professionalism (in the sense of the word that denotes gainful employment) doesn't always equate good grammar.   Good grammar, in my own humble opinion, is a sign of good character. In today's society, it's as important as knowing which fork to use for what and when. Meaning (lamentably), you can get by in this world without it. If that's the case then, why am I so freakishly obsessed with it, going so far as to harp on my fellow Filipinos who make me cringe every time they  utter sentences like " The week's report is finished an ymore"?. More than likely for the same reason that Bill Cosby is berating members of the Black community who choose to converse in the  lingua franca  commonly referred to as  urlLink Ebonics . He doesn't relish the idea that sections of Black America sound ignorant, in the same way that I don't like the idea that my fellow Filipinos sound like uneducated troglodytes. In a world that passionably classifies and categorizes, Mr Cosby and I do not wish to be categorized along with the verbally-impaired.    Speaking of which, Ebonics has earned its spot in pop culture - so much so, that some educators toyed with the idea of turning it into a legitimate course (like French and Spanish). It is a matter of opinion whether Ebonics serves a purpose or not: some Black celebrities (like Oprah Winfrey) do resort to Ebonics every once in a while either to emphasize a statement, or to bring humor to the situation, albeit a la  urlLink Amos and Andy . But, like so many quirks in society, only Blacks can legitimately speak Ebonics and get away with it. (It's like the "N" word, my  nizzah ). Until that same phenomenon repeats itself with the mishmash that some Filipinos pass off as conversational English, I think we should lay off reinventing the language wheel, and just ride the current version.       Don't get me wrong. I myself am perpetually guilty of grammatical errors - I actually correct 'em when I catch 'em. I do hate  posers , though - people who pretend they can speak, but actually just mouth off strings of catch-phrases and buzzwords like parrots. And I   hate   parrots.

      Two weeks into the vacation and life is everything but dull here in Mootown (in spite of what a lot of  outlanders  say).  For starters, there's a real honest-to-goodness castle just a couple of blocks away, constructed by esteemed castle builders with materials specifically used for castle building (okay, the truth is much more staggering, so I wrote that short blurb there to spare you from shock). There are days when I'd pass by the castle estates and marvel at the beauty the owners are sculpting into the landscape; some other days, I feel like erecting a giant siege machine and laying waste to the pretentious&nbsp;fantasy-estate that those rich bastards&nbsp;dare create to blight the already-beautiful scenery with... They do have some wildlife preserves that are home to fowl and deer.&nbsp;We were treated to a visit from a doe&nbsp;(dubbed&nbsp;"Number 3" by Dad, due to the ear tag it sports on its right ear) from one of his majesty's&nbsp;preserves, and that was a novel&nbsp;experience for the boys. Lately, however, ol' Number 3 has become more of a minor annoyance, dropping in uninvited during family marshmallow roasts and nibbling on the vegetable garden. I'm sure Attila the Hun's&nbsp;wild rampage across Europe started out with some interlopers&nbsp;just barging in and doing whatever they pleased.  Another diversion is the small tribe of chipmunks who have created a network of subterranean tunnels&nbsp;across the yard. While this in itself is not a problem yet, those cheeky rodents have decided to stage sapping raids into the garage, chewing on the insulation and having their way around the tools. Dad has been waging a guerilla war of&nbsp;sorts against these&nbsp;malefactors, using an arsenal of chemicals, booby traps, and&nbsp;BB gunfire to fend them off. Alex and I have enlisted our services by guarding the perimeter armed with a Daisy Pumpmaster air rifle. We have not had any confirmed kills yet, although we have massacred a small party of plastic toys that happened to be in the backyard. Oh, the humanity...  It's not all fun and games, of course. Jenn and I have been included in the kitchen duty  roster, taking turns with preparing dinner and giving Mom and Dad some time off. Not that it's hard work, of course. The boys have their swimming lessons to take their minds off the on-going hostilities against the chipmunks, and I still have to deal with my LAST TEN DAYS IN THE NAVY.  For the first time in years (according to Dad), Green Road is paved.&nbsp;Yes, Life is good.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
