      He had hardly spoken a word to her all evening. Every now and then, he would glance at her, his gaze roaming her figure, stripping her with his eyes, hungry yet aloof. He appeared oblivious to the effect this was having on her, that it was making her tremble almost as if he had been running his hands over her instead of his gaze.  Two hours or more of this treatment and she was in mental torment. Finally, in the kitchen, he noticed. He looked her over, then raised an eyebrow.  "Mmm?" was all he said.  She gasped, then, in a low, quiet, soft voice, she murmured "I want... I want..." she paused. Even in this state of torment she felt almost ashamed to finish it, it was almost too humiliating to beg in this manner.  He raised an eyebrow, silently telling her to go on.  She breathed in, and looked down, her breathing starting to sound a little ragged "I want... you... to..." a longer pause, and she closed her eyes before carrying on " to... use me... just for your pleasure."  He smiled slowly. In her current state, it almost seemed a cruel smile. Then he stood up straight - it was almost imperceptible, but the effect on her mind was electric,and she had to fight to stay standing.  "Go upstairs. Strip. Lie on the bed and wait for me" he commanded, then, as she hesitated slightly, he snapped "now".  She went, trembling in anticipation, trembling with nerves. She stripped, and lay there, waiting for him. The open window let in a cool breeze which played across her body, making her shiver with the senastion. Suddenly, she became aware of being watched, and she looked up to see him standing in the doorway, looking her over appraisingly.  Still fully clothed, he propped himself up on the bed next to her. She trembled slightly at the feel of his clothes next to her naked, sensitive skin. He turned briefly, taking something out from a drawer, then ran a hand very gently, very lightly, over her body. She gasped at the feel of leather on her skin, and raised her head so see that he had put on his black leather gloves, the leather almost paper thin, smooth and buttery soft. She shivered at the touch.  Half laying next to her, he rested his head so his mouth was next to her ear. For a moment, all he did was breathe whilst he ran a finger gently down her cheek, down her neck, down one breast and over a nipple. Then quietly, barely more than a breath, in her ear "be careful what you wish for..." he very gently pinched her nipple "... for you might just get it". He pinched it harder, and she gasped.  He moved away slightly so he could more clearly look at her lying there.  "You want me to use you for my pleasure?"  She started to nod, but he stopped her with glance. "Whatever form that may take?"  She nodded again, her throat dry "y... yes" - it came out as a hoarse whisper.  He propped himself up with one arm, looking at her, his face betraying no emotion.  "My pleasure, right now, is your pain. I want your pain, I want your raw emotions. I want to hurt you until you cry out in pain and moan in pleasure." he paused, looking her over once more, "That is my pleasure, and that is what I will take, what I will tear from you."  He lightly ran a gloved hand over her body once more, looking thoughtful for a moment, then reached back and opened the cupboard door. Inside, on hooks, hung canes, floggers, tawses, restraints. He turned his head, and his gaze lingered for a moment on the restraints, then he shook his head slightly and looked at her. "You will not move unless I tell you to, or unless I move you."  Leaving the door open, he sat up, straddled her, then rolled over onto the other side of the bed. Now he no longer obscured the view of the implements hanging up, and he turned her head so she was facing away from him, looking at them. He lay close to her, breathing in her ear once more, then moved forward and gently nibbled at it. He ran one hand over her face, the other gently brushed down to a nipple.  She gasped slightly as he started to gently squeeze and twist it, moaning softly in pleasure. As the pressure grew, as he twisted it harder, the moans of pleasure became moans of pain, and  became moans of pleasure once more. As the intensity grew, she struggled to keep still. Then she felt his teeth stop nibbling at her ear, felt him grab a handful of hair, and pull her head back round so she was facing him. His eyes roamed her face, then looked into hers. His face was unreadable, expressionless almost, apart from a trace of urgent hunger in his eyes. Recognising it, she gasped, eyes widening.  He saw from her reaction that she realised how serious he had been when he told her what his pleasure was, and without warning he tightened his grip on her nipple, squeezing and twisting hard until she was trying to squeal with pain and moan with pleasure at the same time. Her eyes widened more and looked like they would soon water at the pain. He pulled the nipple out a little, then suddenly let go. She gasped, then moaned in anticpation as his hand moved over to her other nipple. This time he watched her expression throughout, from the first gentle squeeze to the final, painful pinch, drinking in her emotions.  He took one glove off, dropping it on her carelessly, and ran his nails over her stomach and down into her dripping cunt. He snorted in derision "Doesn't take much, does it?" He wiped her juices on her skin, then put the glove back on. She let her eyes move to his groin, the bulge there unmistakable, and opened her mouth. Almost before she could think, he slapped a hand firmly over it. "Not a word" he growled "all I want to hear from you are moans and squeals, gasps and yelps."  He moved down, licking one of her tender nipples, waiting until her moans started to build in intensity before switching to the other. He could feel her twitching slightly, struggling to lay still, and he smiled - her submission and her struggle just feeding his lust, his desires.  She fought to keep from moving, but the sensation of his tongue on her sore nipples was so intense it was almost impossible. Each time, just as she thought she couldn't take any more, he moved to the other one, building it up over again. She found she was losing herself to the sensations, starting to get high on them. Then the tingling pleasure became first a gentle twinge, then a more insistant pain as he started to nibble and bite each nipple and she gasped at the shock. He started gently teasing the other nipple with his fingers, alternating between teeth, tongue and fingers. She moaned loudly, heedless of the open window, not caring if passers by could hear.  He licked, nibbled and bit at her ears, her neck, her breasts, her nipples again. Each gasp, each moan just fueled his desire and passion, and he bit harder, running his hands roughly over her body, squeezing and pulling her breasts. He smiled as he watched her expressions, heard her reactions.  She closed her eyes, losing herself in the sensations, pain and pleasure merging into one, dancing apart again, coming together. She moaned, wanting more, and for a moment forgot herself, and writhed on the bed, silently begging him to give her more, to give her as much as he could, as much as he wanted. To take from her all he could, then rip out more.  He watched her for a moment, her movement more eloquent than words. He was hard, but he didn't want sex, not yet. This was far more intoxicating.  Just as she realised she had disobeyed she felt a sharp pain as his gloved hand quickly hit first one cheek, then the other. She gasped, frozen in place. He straddled her, and she gasped again at the sensation of his clothes against her bare, very senstive skin. He roughly grabbed both breasts, squeezing and pulling them, then pinching her nipples until she was moaning and squealing at once. He let them go, and lay down next to her. She felt one hand run through her hair, grab hold of some, and then he was pulling her head to his, forcibly kissing her, sucking and biting her lips, her tongue.  He sat up, and rolled her over so she lay on her front. A muffled gasp as her breasts were pushed into the blanket under her. He grabbed her hair, pulling her head up as far as it would go, ran his other hand down first one cheek, then the other, then gave her two short, sharp slaps, letting go of her hair as soon as the second one landed. He took the gloves off, and ran his nails down the length of her back, leaving long red marks. Then he stood, pulled her head round so she could see the cupboard, and took the cane down. He ran the cane gently over body, eliciting low murmurs of pleasure. Then he rested it on her buttocks for a moment, letting her feel the cold cane slowly warm up.  She watched him raise the cane, shivering involuntarily as he paused before bringing it down. As he started the downward arc, she closed her eyes. The anticpation was ten times worse if she watched him do it. A fraction of a second later he growled "open them". With effort, she did. She felt intensely vulnerable lying there, naked, watching him, fully dressed, bringing a cane down. She was trembling with anticpation, and as she registered that his face was showing no emotion, it grew worse. "still..." he warned, then suddenly her world was fire and pain. She yelped as the cane bit, then again as he pressed it down slightly, holding it for a moment before bringing it back down again, his face impassive, too far away for her to see any expression in his eyes. She gasped even before the cane hit the second time, then yelped as it did, then found herself moaning in pleasure at the pain, at her helplessness.  Three more strokes followed, each feeling harder than the last. She waited for the last one, then felt him lay the cane down across her thighs, felt him run a hand over her arse, heard him make an appreciative murmur.  He stood for a moment, smiling to himself, looking at the 5 perfectly spaced lines he had made, each looking like a thin line of fire running across her otherwise pale buttocks. Then he picked the cane up once more, and swung it hard, landing a 6th and final perfect stripe. He held it against her skin and moaned softly as she squealed in pain.  He leaned over and grabbed her hair, twisting her head so she was face down again. She heard him put he cane away, heard him get various things out, then a moment or two later felt him kneel up on the bed behind her, then a sharp pain as he grabbed her hair and pulled her head upwards. Ordering her to keep her head up as high as she could, he let go of her hair. Her head dropped a bit, and she just caught a glance of the blindfold before her vision went. She gasped, and felt the ball gag press against her lips, into her mouth, silencing her. He pulled her arms behind her back, cuffing them there, then fastened cuffs around her ankles. Then nothing.  He paused, looking at her for a moment, trying to decide how he wanted her. Then he reached overand unclipped her arms, instead clipping each armto an ankle, forcing her to half kneel on the bed, face down, bum in the air leaving both her arse and her cunt exposed.  She lay there, feeling vulnerable and exposed, unable to move, to see, to speak. She could feel how wet she was. Suddenly, she felt his fingers in her cunt, thrusting and twisting for a moment. Then he pulled them out - it felt as if he was scooping her juices out too. Then one hand started stroking her bottom, pulling one cheek away from the other. She felt one of his fingers push insistently into her arse and she squirmed as much as she could, trying to wriggle backwards onto it. Then his cock forced its way into her cunt, thrusting deep and hard into her. She wanted to squirm, to gasp, to writhe, to cry out, getting more frustrated and more aroused by each futile attempt to do any of them. She couldn't hold back much longer.  He debated for a moment ordering her not to orgasm until he told her she could, and decided against it. His eyes lit on something he'd got out, and not yet used. Carefully with his free hand, he reached over, and picked it up.  Her back arched as the first stroke with the flogger hit,and she felt even more keenly her restraints. Another blow, then another, and suddenly she couldn't hold back, couldn't keep it in. She felt like she exploded inside. She was dimly aware of his finger pulling out of her arse, of his nails raking her back, of his own triumphant grunts as she came, then as he came deep inside her. She felt him pull out, felt him push his fingers into her cunt again, scooping out his cum and her juices. With the other hand, he pushed her so she was lying on her side, and she felt him massaging the hot, sticky mix onto her nipples. She shuddered slightly, too exhausted to cum again.  He left her lying there whilst he cleaned himself, taking a little longer than usual. Then fixed some drinks, and finally released her.  That was earlier.  Now, she sits on the sofa, smiling, waiting for him to come back.

        (This fiction was jointly written in 5 parts, alternating between B and C. This is a consolidation of those 5 parts  previously posted seperately on this 'blog)    Amanda knew that she was in trouble.   She wasn't entirely sure what her husband would say when he got home, but there really was no way that she would be able to finish her chores in time now, and he'd been insistant that they should be completed.  "I suppose it will serve me right if he spanks me", she thought, "after all, I should have started doing these hours ago. Still, I suppose that if I at least start doing them and get as much done as I can, he might not mind them not being finished."  Just as she finished hoovering, she heard the foreboding sound of the car pulling onto the driveway shortly followed by the rattle of his keys in the lock. "I'm for it now..." she thought as she finished putting the hoover back in the cupboard under the stairs.   She hurried over to door from the entrance hallway, hoping that greeting him with a kiss and a cheerful "Hello Darling" might (combined with his long day at work) persuade him to overlook the fact that she had not yet finished the list of things to do.  The kiss and the greeting brought a smile to his face, and it was a second or so before he glanced around. The living room had been hoovered and tidied, as per Amanda's list. He smiled again.  "I'll just fix us some drinks - it looks like you've had a busy a day as I have" he said cheerfully.  Hoping her eyes didn't betray her, she smiled "No, no - let me get them. You sit down and relax. After all, I've not had to commute anywhere" and went into the kitchen before he could say anything.  She knew he wouldn't think to look under the sofa or in the sideboard - which was where she'd hurriedly shoved the magazines that were scattered over the lounge. But she couldn't easily hide the basket full of damp washing, taken out of the machine that morning and still not hung up. Nor could she do the pile of washing up still waiting to be done in the time it took for the kettle to boil. Besides, he would hear her.  As the kettle boiled she gave a gasp. Her computer was still turned on, and a quick glance would certainly give him a good idea of what she has spent her day doing. The trouble was, reading 'blogs was so addictive. Her mind raced as she made the tea, almost forgetting to put his one-and-a-bit-well-really-only-one sugar in his cup.  Finally, as she brought the tea through into the lounge, she hit on a plan.  "Here's your tea sweetheart" murmured Amanda softly as she put it down on the coffee table in the middle of the living room within reach of the sofa.  Now, all she needed to do was keep him out of the kitchen and bedroom long enough for her to be able to make the bed, hide the laundry (the outdoor clothes drier was still in the shed as they hadn't got round to putting it up yet, so no chance of hanging it up out back) and finish off the washing up.   At least the bed wouldn't take long to sort out. All it would need would be the sheets straightening and the duvet an pillows arranging. But how to keep him out of the bedroom when he would want to go and get changed out of his suit and into something more comfortable once he'd finished that cup of tea? Perhaps if she waited in the hope that he would need the bathroom, then run into the bedroom there would be the chance that she might be able to make the bed before he went in to get changed. But how to keep him occupied while she finished off downstairs?   She sat down next to her husband on the sofa and kissed him tenderly on the cheek, "Let me take your case and jacket upstairs and hang them up for you my darling while you put your feet up. I'll get you a couple of biscuits - you look like you've had a hard day"   "Thank you darling, that's very thoughtful of you."  "phew, that's a relief - thought he was going to go straight upstairs to get changed" thought Amanda as she popped into the kitchen to get a couple of chocolate biscuits,   "I'm doing us spaghetti with tomato, garlic and chilli sauce for dinner tonight" she called through from the kitchen. "Ooh, my favourite. Could you just pop the biscuits down next to my mug? I need the loo - back in a moment." came the reply.  As she heard him start to go upstairs Amanda hurried quietly out of the kitchen, put the biscuits on a plate by the mug and dashed upstairs into the bedroom. Hurriedly, she finished starighening up the bed - pulling sheets and duvet up and straightening the pillows. "Eeek.. Running water, he must be washing his hands!" she thought. However, she was just in time, opening the wardrobe door to hang up his suit jacket just as he walked in to get changed after finishing in the bathroom.  "Thank you darling. I'll just get changed and go back downstairs and finish that cup of tea." He sat on the bed and started undoing his shoelaces.  Amanda almost breathed a sigh of relief ("one down, two to go!" she thought) and said cheerfully, hoping that her voice wouldn't give anything away, "Tell you what my darling. Why don't you put your feet up on the bed and have a read while I cook dinner? I'll bring you up your tea and biscuits." She leaned forwards and kissed him gently on the lips.  "Mmm, I might just do that" he said, stifling a yawn.  Amanda headed downstairs, feeling almost triumphant - she'd got away with it so far, but as she got halfway down the stairs, he wandered out onto the landing and called after her in a puzzled tone of voice "Darling, why wasn't there any laundry hanging up in the bathroom?"  Amanda paused briefly and trying not to look startled turned slightly to look up at him, quickly framing her answer very carefully in her mind before replying...  "It's the underwear, silly - I almost always tumble dry it. It just makes it feel so much nicer..." she managed a smile and a gentle laugh as she headed off to cook dinner, hoping he wouldn't check to see if it had been put away.  Downstairs, she quickly rearranged the washing so there was a new, black T-shirt obscuring the door. Unless you actually peered at it, it looked empty. Happy with the effect, she started clattering around preparing dinner, then turned the CD player on, skipping to a particularly noisy track, and a favourite of hers. Having established the background noise, she speedily washed up whilst the sauce cooked. Just before she put the pasta on, she raced upstairs with the empty laundry basket, then stuck her head round the bedroom door.  "Just doing the pasta" she said cheerily.  He grinned "I'm famished... mmm" he looked her over appraisingly, hungrily for a moment, causing her to blush. "I s'pose dinner would spoil if I tore you away from it right now?"  "Y... yes" she stammered, and raced downstairs, rapidly drying up what she could whilst the rest of dinner cooked.  She glanced at the timer - two minutes to go. She might just make it. So preoccupied with doing dinner and trying to finish the drying up, she didn't hear him come into the kitchen. She was suddenly aware of his breath on her neck, and his arms around her waist. He kissed her lightly on the cheek, then moved to get the cutlery out. She must be overly paranoid, she thought, but she was sure he paused a moment to glance in the sink, and to look over the draining board, where some wet dishes still remained. But he said nothing, just took the cutlery through.  After dinner, he cuddled her and, grinning, said "You know darling, pampering me when I got home, cooking me my favourite dinner, a more suspicious man than I would think you were hiding something." His tone made it clear he was joking, so she again managed a laugh "Well, I had to remove the evidence that I see a fancy man whilst you're out".  But out of the corner of her eye she noticed that one of the sideboard doors wasn't properly shut. He caught the look of panic in her eyes, and followed her gaze, starting to frown as he couldn't see anything that would alarm his wife. He was about to say so, when one of the cats jumped up onto it, misjudged slightly, and scrabbled up, sending the door flying open. Almost in slow motion, the magazines fell out onto the floor.  Amanda gasped, her hands flying to her mouth as she watched in horror. With a smile, he took her wrist, and gently but silently led her back into the kitchen, opening the washing machine door. The wet washing fell out onto the floor in a heap. He felt it, and teasingly said "I think the tumble dryer must be broken. This is still all very damp. And just how long ago did you do the washing up?"  She gulped, and hung her head. "I err, got a bit carried away. Doing things." He said nothing, just watching her, waiting for her to explain further. When nothing was forthcoming, he pulled himself up to his full height, and looked down at her sternly, tipping her head up so he could see her face. "Things?" he queried, in "that" tone.  "'blogs" she almost whispered "I was reading blogs..."  She tried to lower her head, but he held it there, looking into her eyes. His expression was stern, disappointment mingled with mild annoyance. Quietly, so she had to strain to hear it "You let reading blogs take precendence over the tasks I set? I'm disappointed in you, my darling. I had expected better of you than that". He paused, watching her, hiding his smile as her cheeks reddened - she always did look so appealing when she blushed, whatever the cause.  "Now - upstairs with you this instant. You know what we agreed."  She went upstairs, dragging her feet a little. After all, it wasn't as if she had completely ignored it. He followed her up, sat down on the dressing table chair, and grabbed her wrist, pulling her to him. Before she had a chance to complain, he had pulled her skirt up, her panties down, and then pulled her over his knee, holding her down with his free hand.  she wriggled desperately to try and get free, but he held her firmly, enjoying the spectacle of her naked bottom wiggling away. Just as she seemed be getting fairly frenzied in her attempts, he brought the palm of his hand down onto her bare buttocks. She froze mid wriggle and squealed at the sting. He repeated it, and smiled at the red glow that was appearing. Again, she tried to wriggle free, and again he spanked her twice, hard, smiling at the squeals and the growing rosy glow.  "Two more" he said, and again brought his palm down hard on her rear. She squealed again, indignantly more than with pain, and finally wriggled free after the last one. She rubbed her sore behind, then hurriedly rearranged her clothes, gaining some semblance of dignity.  She moved away a couple of paces and stuck her hands on her hips. "I hardly think that was fair!" she protested "after all, I did get most of it done, even if not quite how you'd envisaged!"  He watched her as she ranted, quietly amused, aware that his expression was probably just adding fuel to the fire, which simply made him smile a little more. As she started the third variant of "it's not fair, I did most of it" he stood up, his amused expression dropping from him like a cloak. "That" he said quietly, authoritatively, "is hardly the point" he smiled a little "and I don't think fairness, or at least the usual perception of such, comes into this at all. Do you?"  She gasped, and stuttered a no. He walked around to the "toy cupboard", and got out the cane.  "Now - for your insolence, I think 6 will be enough. On the bed, now"  His tone did not even allow for disobedience, and she found herself face down on the bed, bum in the air, skirt hitched up over hips and her panties down around knees before she even realised she'd done it.  It wasn't, he decided, a bad enough offence to warrant 6 full strength blows with the cane. He smiled, watching her lying there, tense with anticipation of the pain to come. But, he thought, there was no need to tell her that. He settled instead for telling her she must not move until it was over - and if she did, she would earn herself another stroke per move. He smiled once more, and swished the cane down.  She yelped as the cane bit - she could feel a fiery stripe appearing on her buttocks where it landed. She wanted to roll out the way, to rub it, but she gritted her teeth, and stayed put. She knew it wasn't full strength, and she found herself tensing, expecting the next one to land harder. Then, remembering the pain would be worse if she stayed tense, she tried to force herself to relax.  Standing over her, he smiled again as he saw her internal struggle, then brought the cane down with a swish, pulling it back a little just before it landed so that if anything, it was slightly lighter than before. The smile widened as he realised it had landed parallel to the first, even with the movement of the cane just before impact. Then again, once, twice, three times more. He paused again, admiring the parallel lines before he brought the cane down for one last stroke as he murmured "last one".  As the final cane stroke landed on her buttocks, he softly told her that she could now lay down. Amanda crumpled forwards onto the bed, and as he hung the cane back onto it's hook she began to sniffle. And then to sob.  He sat down on the bed beside her, and ran his fingers gently through her hair as the sobbing turned to tears and Amanda began to cry.  "I... I'm sorry my darling" she managed to get out in between sobs as a tear ran down her cheek.  He wiped away the tear and kissed her cheek softly. "You know my love. That spanking wasn't because you hadn't finished your chores. It was because you decided to try and hide the fact." he paused and kissed her gently again, rolling her onto her side so he could credle her head in his lap. Softly, he continued, "It was because you decided that rather than coming to me and apologising that you'd been distracted, you decided to try to deceive me."  Amanda sobbed again, feeling his arms gently round her, holding her, caring for her. "I'm sorry I tried to deceive you" she sniffed "I know that I should have said, but..."  "But you thought that I wouldn't notice? Sweetheart, If you'd just apologised, what do you think would have happened?"  "I thought you'd spank me", another sniffle, her tears drying.  He wiped her cheek gently, lovingly "I might have done, but only if you hadn't finished them by the time we would have been going to bed. Yes, I'd have been annoyed, but if you'd been honest with me, I'd have just given you a little more time, and you probably wouln't have been spanked and caned. Would you?"  "Oh sweetheart. I love you. I'm sorry"  "Hush baby," he put a finger gently to her lips, "you don't need to keep apologising. It's all over and dealt with now." a brief pause, then "I love you too. Very much"  They kissed gently, and then he smiled warmly; "So you spent the day reading blogs eh? Any good postings I should know about?"   "Well... there was a post on..." she said, and he cut her off with a kiss. Then laughing together, they went to their respective computers and started reading the blogs...
