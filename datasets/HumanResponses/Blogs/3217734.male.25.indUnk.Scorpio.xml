      Dhaka | May 29, 2004 4:46:29 PM IST   A Bangladesh parliamentary standing committee has asked concerned authorities to issue orders to stop felling trees in the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest, against the backdrop of reports suggesting a high rate of forest depletion in the area.  The directives came after the committee was informed that not preventing the felling of these trees could damage the ecosystem of the mangrove forest, which is also one of the world's largest wildlife sanctuaries.  The Sunderbans makes up 44 percent of Bangladesh's forest area (38,500 square kilometer of forest and wetland). Repeated warnings by the experts and officials are being ignored, as the Sundarbans provides employment to over 300,000 people.   It also home to a large number of plants, 20,000 kinds of animals, 315 species of birds, 400 species of fish, 53 species of reptiles and eight species of amphibians. The experts warn that diminishing plant life in the forest can jeopardize animals.  There were reports of a wholesale felling of trees in the name of elimination of infected Sundri trees from the forest, Munshi Anwarul Islam, the chief conservator of the forest (CCF), told Asian News International.   "We will take every measure necessary to protect the forest," he added.  Sundri trees, which constitute about 70 percent of the forest, have been withering away for the past 30 years. At least 20 per cent of them are afflicted with a disease that eventually kills them from the top down.   "There has to be a study on the change of ecosystem of the Sundarbans immediately, as there is no such study on this mangrove forest," said Dr.   Ainun Nishat, Bangladesh's representative at the International Union for The Conservation of Nature (IUCN).(ANI)

      Farmers in Sikandarpur village in Jessore are being doubly benefited. They are earning more money by producing vegetables at lesser costs while protecting the environment also.  They use Ferromon Trap, a simple device innovated by Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI), to kill insects instead of applying insecticides, harmful for the environment.  Dr Nurul Alam, co-ordinator of BARI's Entomology Department, supervises of the great efforts of the farmers.  According to FAO (UN Food and Agricultural Organisation), Jessore was one of the three regions in Bangladesh where pesticides were used excessively earlier. Pesticides were used in brinjal fields up to 80 times in a season, according to officials of Bagherpara upazila Agriculture Extension Department (AED).  But the scene is different now. They do not use pesticide.  "It is a revolution", said Mohammad Alauddin, a Block Supervisor of AED while talking to this correspondent last week.   "This (use of Ferromon Trap) increases yield as the trap also kills pesticide-resistant insects," Alauddin said.  The tool is very much user-friendly and involves virtually no cost compared to that for pesticide.  The trap is made with a plastic pot. A medicine named 'Sex-Ferromon' is kept inside it.  "The smell of the medicine attracts pests and insects. They fly into it and die within seconds," said Laxman Chandra, president of Krishi Prajukti Bastabayan Kendra (KPBK), a centre for application of agriculture technology.  Union Parishad member and farmer Anisul Islam said pesticides worth at least Tk 400 were needed to control pest attack on brinjals on one bigha land, he said. Farmers are now saving the amount.  BARI distributed one thousand Ferromon Traps this year among brinjal cultivators free of cost to popularise the unique method.  KPBK members said the method is being used on all vegetable fields at Sikandarpur village.  Magura AED Deputy Director Osiul Islam when contacted said, BARI's new method will play a pioneering role in protecting environment while increasing the yield.   - Hossain Seraj, back from Sikandarpur (Jessore), Daily Star

      Global warming is now advancing so swiftly that only a massive expansion of nuclear power as the world's main energy source can prevent it overwhelming civilisation, the scientist and celebrated Green guru, James Lovelock, says.  His call will cause huge disquiet for the environmental movement. It has long considered the 84-year-old radical thinker among its greatest heroes, and sees climate change as the most important issue facing the world, but it has always regarded opposition to nuclear power as an article of faith. Last night the leaders of both Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth rejected his call.  Professor Lovelock, who achieved international fame as the author of the Gaia hypothesis, the theory that the Earth keeps itself fit for life by the actions of living things themselves, was among the first researchers to sound the alarm about the threat from the greenhouse effect. ... he says, there is simply not enough time for renewable energy, such as wind, wave and solar power - the favoured solution of the Green movement - to take the place of the coal, gas and oil-fired power stations whose waste gas, carbon dioxide (CO2), is causing the atmosphere to warm.  He believes only a massive expansion of nuclear power, which produces almost no CO2, can now check a runaway warming which would raise sea levels disastrously around the world, cause climatic turbulence and make agriculture unviable over large areas. He says fears about the safety of nuclear energy are irrational and exaggerated, and urges the Green movement to drop its opposition...

      Twelve-year-old Kancha, the male of the lone rhino couple of Dhaka zoo, died yesterday noon apparently after it slid down the stairs to the water tub on Sunday morning.  .  The reason for the death was not confirmed, however. One source claimed that it died from infection in the front right leg that he had been suffering since April. He added that the authorities pushed a 1000 cc injection through the vein near its left ear.   Yet another source blamed the death on the scorching heat. The zoo officials were not available for comments.  The authorities have formed a three-member committee to probe the death. The zoo sources said the body of the four-metre long, 36-inch tall rhino weighing 2,000 kilogram will be buried at the zoo premises after autopsy.   The late Nepalese King Raja Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev gifted the rhino couple to Dhaka zoo back in 1992 when they were six months old.   Zoo sources said his partner, Kanchi, has become depressed about the death and is not eating anything since then. The rhinos reached adulthood at seven but have no offspring.

Elephants, by contrast, are now plentiful enough to allow the controversial ivory trade to be resumed legally, according to a proposal, with some countries allowed to sell pre-set annual quotas. There are also calls for commercial trade in elephant leather to resume.  The recommendations are among 50 new proposals for regulating trade in animal parts and plants released on Wednesday by CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora....

      Honeybees can precisely regulate the temperature of their nest- and they do it thanks to genetically determined variations in their individual thermostats. The new research has revealed one of the few known benefits of the high genetic diversity found in honeybee colonies.  Maintaining a nest temperature of between about 32DC and 36DC is vital during spring and summer, when eggs are developing and hatching.   If they don't keep the nest at this temperature, the brood won't develop properly,says Julia Jones of the University of Sydney, Australia, who led the work.

A joint survey by two conservation groups, World Conservation Union and the World Wildlife Fund, says the black rhino population has risen to over 3,600. That is an increase of 500 animals over the last two years.   A World Wildlife official, Taye Teferi, says the biggest challenge facing the species is making sure current conservation efforts are maintained.  Conservationists say the black rhinoceros had been on the decline since the 1970s, when their numbers dropped from 65,000 to only 2,400 in the mid 1990s.   They say the single most important cause for that decline has been the demand for their horns in the Middle East and East Asia.

      OSLO, Norway — A new survey of the depths of the ice-capped Arctic Ocean could reveal a lost world of living fossils and exotic new species from jellyfish to giant squid, scientists said Thursday.   The international scheme will include probing a 12,470-foot abyss off Canada described by project leaders as the "world's oldest sea water — a vast, still pool unstirred for millennia, walled by steep ridges and lidded with ice."  Scientists in the project, led from the University of Alaska, plan to use robot submarines and sonar to track down life in the chilly Arctic Ocean, where they say many species may be at risk from global warming.  "This is the world's refrigerator where change has happened far more slowly than in other oceans," said researcher Russ Hopcroft at the University of Alaska, saying the census could easily double the number of species known in the Arctic. ....

      Dolphins aren't the homebodies they were once thought to be, according to a new genetic study. Luciana Moeller and Luciano Beheregaray of Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, took tissue samples from two populations of southern bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus aduncus) near Sydney. Paternity tests on each sample determined the family relationships within each pod.  Previous behavioral studies of American and other Australian dolphins suggested that both sexes remained near their region of birth. But the new DNA data found otherwise. The researchers report in the journal Molecular Ecology that the males in each group were less likely to be related to other dolphins in the group than females. Males were also more likely to have come from a completely different dolphin pod.  The finding helps explain why males dally and visit other dolphin groups more often than females. The biologists believe males leave to avoid inbreeding. It may also be more important for females to stay by known food sources to support their young.

The elephant was lying dead since June 10 in Yangcha spreading stinky smell. It was sent for a laboratory test later. Local administration yesterday admitted the elephant was carrying the virus.  Deputy Commissioner (DC) of Bandarban Md Hafisur Rahman said they buried the carcass and cordoned off the area.  Officials of the Department of Forest said elephants frequently take a route between India, Myanmar and Bangladesh.

      Polythene shopping bags are again being used extensively in different markets of the district despite ban. All types of polythene shopping bags including black bags which are more detrimental to human health have again reappeared in the market. The shop keepers after packing different consumer items in polythene shopping bags are giving delivery to the consumers. Different food items e.g. fish, meat, sugar, salt, rice, ata, pulse, spieces etc are being sold in polythene shopping bags. In the confectioneries bread, biscuit, cake, chocolate, noodle etc are being sold in polythene shopping bags. The consumers are bound to take polythene packed items as there are no other alternatives.   The government has imposed a ban on the production, sale and distribution of polythene shopping bags about a year ago. At that time a movement not to use polythene shopping bags was launched by the government in different areas of the country. But within a year the movement has stopped and polythene bags have again revived in the markets. The manufacturers of polythene shopping bags after a year have again started manufacturing polythene shopping bags. The wholesale traders are selling the bags to the grocery, confectionery and other shopkeepers.

      Coastal resources are vital for many local communities and indigenous people. For a country like Bangladesh, coastal zones are the most available areas for development activities. However, unlike other countries, Bangladesh has a very peculiar and unique coastline. Any initiation regarding drawing baseline to delimit maritime boundaries, managing stakeholders involved in coastal business in any capacity, conserving coastal bio-diversity, protecting coastal ecosystem from any invasion necessitate having a clear idea about the special features of the coast and threats to it.  Specialities Bangladesh has the largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans (one of the RAMSAR site and also declared as the World Heritage according to the provision given in World Cultural and Natural Heritage Convention) on the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers on the Bay of Bengal. The whole forest is intersected by a complex network of tidal waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests, and presents an excellent example of ongoing ecological processes. The area is known for its wide range of fauna, including 260 bird species, the Royal Bengal Tiger and other threatened species such as the estuarine crocodile and the Indian python. ...

      An inter-ministerial meeting yesterday rejected a proposal to hand over two ecologically critical areas in Cox's Bazar to Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation (BPC) for building exclusive tourist centres.  The Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism made the proposal to hand over to the BPC the tiny Sonadia and Cheradia islands but the inter-ministerial meet turned it down to protect the bio-diversity and reserve forests of the two areas, meeting placed sources said.  Sonadia, an island of 2,965.37 acres of land located in Kutubjhum under Moheshkhali upazila of Cox's Bazar, has already been officially declared an ecologically critical area.   Some 2,122 acres of the total land have been given to Forest Department for developing reserve forest. The island already has natural forest on 1200 acres and another 400 acres have been brought under afforestation.  Cheradia comprising 18.70 acres of land is part of Saint Martin's Island. It is a coral sanctuary having 89 species of fish and no human habitation on it. ...

      It is a small chemical capsule in a plastic bottle half-filled with water. But it works wonders -- insects flock to the bottle to drown.   Farmers, who earlier used to apply heavy doses of pesticide in their vegetable fields, now need only this wonder capsule they call 'talisman'.   Scientists call it pheromone -- the female sex hormone of insects -- that attracts the male.   This technology will radically change the use of pesticide in Bangladesh, making vegetables free from toxic elements, they envisage. ...

      The eye soothing coconut gardens in Kuakata sea beach are disappearing.  The gardens with 15,000 trees on 167 acres of land stretching eight kilometres in length along the beach were raised in 1960s, local people said.  The gardens, raised by some local NGOs with assistance from the then government, also served as good picnic spots. Several lakh taka were earned annually from sale of green coconuts.  Decay of trees was first noticed about five years back. Now the number of coconut trees would be hardly 10,000, local people and officials of Patuakhali Forest Department and NGOs told this correspondent during a recent visit to the area.   This correspondent saw hundreds of left over roots after the dead coconut trees were taken away by local people.  Trees are dying in large scale now, they said. Heavy deposit of sand on the beach, carried by tidal waves, could be the reason, they said.   They think thick layer of sand on the ground prevents coconut trees from getting nutrients from soil as their roots do not penetrate deep into the soil. Excessive deposit of sand is harmful for them, forest officials said.  Water level in the sea beach rises by six to ten feet over the normal level during every rainy season, they said.

        Chinese scientists have discovered the world's first fossilised embryonic pterosaur, the flying reptile that lived alongside the dinosaurs.  The embryo, dated to 121 million years ago, was found snuggled inside fragments of eggshell, its leathery wing membranes and skin imprints "exquisitely preserved". Xiaolin Wang and Zhonghe Zhou of the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences published their research in the current issue of the journal Nature.  "Dinosaur embryos have been discovered all over the world, but so far no pterosaur embryos have been reported," the scientists said.

      It is increasingly disturbing to read the daily news articles on grabbing wetlands (lakes, jheels, mangroves) and parks especially in the large cities, cutting trees and destruction of forest reserve in the country. At the same time, we are also reading news on depleting groundwater aquifer in Dhaka and other parts of the country and increasing risk of floods. There is a strong relationship among these natural resources, I wonder if either our policy makers or the land grabbers and illegal loggers have any idea how these natural resources are acting as essential components of the natural eco-system and maintain a strong link among themselves. I do not want to write a long story on this topic, just to make it short, let me explain some of the basics:  Wetland  Wetlands are recognized as important features in the landscape that provide numerous beneficial services for people and for fish and wildlife. Some of these services, or functions include protecting and improving water quality, providing fish and wildlife habitats, storing floodwaters, and maintaining surface water flow during dry periods. These beneficial services, considered valuable to societies worldwide, are the result of the inherent and unique natural characteristics of wetlands. .... - Masud Karim

      Nil Sagar can be turned into a sanctuary of birds through plantation of saplings of bird-friendly trees like mango, jack-fruit, blackberry and guava around the tourist spot.  State Minister for Education and Minister-in-Charge of Nilphamari district ANM Ehsanul Huq Milon told this while visiting the Nil Sagar area on Sunday afternoon.  During his visit to the area he also directed the district administration to take special measures to plant saplings of bird-friendly trees there. His entourage included the secratary general of EAB (Engineers' Association of Bangladesh) Shahrin Islam Tuhin.  The state minister expressed his displeasure when he saw that many old trees were already vanished. Local journalists who were accompanying him to Nil Sagar made him aware that the site developers ignored the environmental aspects of the attractive spot since the beginning of the project work in early 2001. As a result it could not be turned into a sanctuary of birds.

      Though as bare-skinned as humans, hippos avoid burning up in the hot equatorial sun. Now researchers have demonstrated that hippos beat the heat by sweating out their own brand of sunscreen.  In the study, scientists led by Yoko Saikawa of Keio University in Yokohama, Japan, swabbed the sticky secretion off the backs of captive hippos. When first exuded, the fluid is clear but soon polymerizes into a reddish-brown molecular chains. In the lab, the researchers identified red and orange pigments in the slime.  The red pigment, dubbed hipposudoric acid, absorbs light in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum, suggesting it can function as sunblock. The slime also appears to serve as an antibiotic ointment. When the scientists added the slime to colonies of disease-causing bacteria from hippo skin, even low doses of the slime stopped the bacteria from proliferating. The research was reported in the journal Nature.

The World Health Organization (WHO) sources informed that about 28,076 people from different districts have arsenic symptoms, while DPHE found 15,500 having arsenic related diseases.   But arsenic contaminated tube wells were identified only in a number of upazillas out of 460. The DPHE conducted test of arsenic contaminated tube wells in 90 upazillas, while the UNICEF in 45.   Tube wells in maximum upazillas still remained unidentified due to lack of infrastructure and shortage of experts and raw materials as well.  follow the link to read more...

Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia is expected to inaugurate the fair at 11 a.m.  Addressing a press conference in the PID conference room, Environment and Forests Minister Tariqul Islam said tree fairs would be held in 107 upazilas of the country to strengthen afforestation programme.   Mr. Islam expressed the hope that saplings worth taka one crore 50 lakh would be sold at the National Tree Fair this year.  He informed that saplings worth taka one crore 20 lakh were sold last year.  The minister said the present government has been working relentlessly under the leadership of the prime minister for protecting country’s forest resources.   He said a programme has been taken at the initiative of the prime minister to plant one crore coconut saplings in the eight greater districts in the coastal areas. As part of this programme, a total of 42 lakh coconut saplings would be planted in the current season, he added.  The minister said the Thai government has promised to supply one crore coconut seeds as a friendly gesture to Bangladesh. He said four thousand seeds (Thai Tall Variety) are expected to reach Chittagong by June and a Thai expert team is also expected to visit Bangladesh in July.  Mr. Islam said that the forest department has been instructed to plant those trees which are on the verge of extinction. Effective measures are being taken to halt felling of trees and hill cutting. He said 15 persons of forest department were suspended in this connection.  He said 10 percent of the country’s total area is covered by forest which would be increased to 20 percent by 2015.   State Minister for Environment and Forests Jafrul Islam Chowdhury and Forests Secretary Syed Tanvir Hossain and Principal Information Officer Khondakar Manirul Alam were present.

      Primitive fish have advanced protective mechanism.  When discussing the attributes that make mammals special, a sophisticated immune response generally comes close to the top of the list. But now it seems that we're not so unique after all.   Researchers have found that fish-like creatures called lampreys have evolved their own system, using building blocks that are completely unrelated to the antibodies found in mammals. The discovery opens up a new world for immunologists, who had previously assumed there was only one way of doing things – ours.   "The result blew my mind," says Chris Amemiya, molecular geneticist at the Benaroya Research Institute in Seattle, and an author of the study. "Now we know there are at least two ways of making the adaptive immune system."  .....

The legal notice said that despite the High Court's directive, the government has failed to submit any action plan to free the Buriganga from all encroachments.  The notice also blamed the government for its leniency in protecting the river from encroachment.  Bela has requested the authorities to inform it of their action within 48 hours of the receipt of the notice. Otherwise, it will go for legal action, Bela said in a press release.  The legal notice was served on the secretaries of land, water resources and environment ministries, director general of Department of Environment, chairmen of Water Development Board, Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority and Desa, and district commissioners of Dhaka and Narayanganj.

Their bones have been found alongside those of horses, hyenas, deer, primitive mammoths, rodents and plants giving what London's Natural History Museum says is an unprecedented insight into an unknown "warm" period 500,000-780,000 years ago.

      JOHANNESBURG — Rare species like the black rhino are being wiped out in Zimbabwe because of rampant poaching and human settlement on private game reserves seized by the state, a conservation group said on Thursday.   "At the moment the situation really stinks," said Johnny Rodrigues, the head of the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force, a wildlife advocacy group. "The reports we're getting from the guys on the ground are that all the wildlife stocks have been completely wiped out in the private conservancies. There's nothing left," he said from his Zimbabwe home.  Rodrigues said private reserves, once one of the backbones of Zimbabwe's thriving wildlife and tourism industries, were being decimated by President Robert Mugabe's seizure of white-owned land for distribution to blacks.  The black rhino population has halved in four years, and the African wild dog is in danger of extinction in Zimbabwe, he said. Elephant numbers have also dropped....

      We had been to two villages in Chapai Nawabganj districts this month (June 25 & 26, 2004) and worked there for two days. With the collaboration of a local NGO we carried out a quick survey in the two villages and a summary of the survey is given below:  For limitation of time and manpower we only included 58 households who are drinking water from arsenic contaminated tube wells in the villages Maharajpur and Chhatrajitpur. There are other similar households we did not include.  - these households include 458 members, 70% are children and women - all are drinking and cooking from arsenic contaminated tube wells - very badly affected arsenicosis patients are common, we have seen 14, we had no doctor to identify.  -average annual income ranges from 20000 to 100000 ( equivalent to US$ 350 to 1700 ) - the NGOs and  local government identified their tube wells as arsenic contaminated several years back but they are still without any safe drinking water.  We with the help of our friends (Dr. Alauddin of Wagner College NewYork, Dr. Munir from Sono filter, Kustia, Mr. Paul, a medical student of Chicago Medical School, the Local NGO, BAIC and my students), we purchased 40 Sono filters for arsenic removal and distributed them on subsidized and soft loan basis to the families who will share these among themselves. We also plan to provide them with Selenium supplement and vitamins to flush out the arsenic they already ingested.  -Professor Iqbal Zuberi, University of Rajshahi.

      From AP August 01, 2004  DHAKA, Bangladesh: Mahmuda Khatun left her flood shelter in a small boat loaded with empty water containers, prowled her inundated neighborhood for a while, and came back empty-handed. 'No one had any water to give us,' she said.  With 40 per cent of her city flooded, water is everywhere, but it is mixed in with sewage and undrinkable. The disaster, experts say, is largely man-made. Bangladesh and its capital, Dhaka, lie in a flood plain, and annual deluges from mighty rivers fed by monsoon rains and melting Himalayan snow are natural.  But deforestation of distant mountains washes topsoil downhill and silts up the rivers that are supposed to channel the floodwater into the Bay of Bengal.
