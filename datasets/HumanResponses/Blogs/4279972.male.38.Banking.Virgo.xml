      Well i missed Friday, due to a heavy afternoon session on the beer after work. Hurray for cheap larger that gets you hammered in record time, along with some real ale stuff that i had, the sort of beer that is drank by men with beards.  Anyway my rant is about pubs, not ya normal friendly boozer that is welcoming and a good laugh, but the clicky little back street pub where strangers are not welcome.  We've all been there and you break the cardinal rule of sitting in "Berts seat", even though he aint in the pub, nobody is allowed to sit in his seat, and unless you were born in that bloody street and lived there for sixty years your not a regular.  Man i hate pubs like that, and they are always run by a complete arrogant wanker, who thinks he is an expert on everything, and can talk to anyone in any manner he feels like as he's the landlord.  A classic example of this was the ex landlord of The Hornblower, a knob called Ken Bates, but enough on him. And the other thing about these pubs is the fact that when you walk in, a stranger you get that silence. ALL conversation stops for a good ten minutes. Then it all starts up again, leaving you on your own. Deep fucking joy, and i have noticed how zenophobic these pubs are, god help anyone who's an ethnic minority who walks in there.  Right that's my bile vented.  Bit about Newport in Gwent.  Sights to see... The clock in John Frost Square. A massive piece of waste to put in bluntly. It opens up on the hour, and is a total embarresment to the town, sorry CITY.  The war memorial in John Frost Square is also an insult. I lump of rock. I kid you not, what an insult to the troops. I wonder who though that idea up, must of took them hours! Hay lets remember all the brave troops who fought in the war, and put a rock in John Frost Square.  The Wave. This is on the waterfront, that is being developed at the moment. Basicly this is a red thing, with a trangular flag thing stuck in the middle. It was illuminated once, but kids have smashed all the lights that were set in the ground. A classic waste of money.  The Pig. Yes we have a statue of a pig! Outside the indoor market, the only thing i can say about it, is at least the kids like it..

      HI THERE!  Welcome to my 1st BLOG! Ok a bit about me first. My name is Paul, and I live in Newport, South Wales. A City now, although most of the residents think of it as a town.  I work for a finance company - well Lloyds Tsb, but then someone has to. And the main reason i have decided to blog, is partly to talk about me, partly about the place I live and partly just to rant and rave about what ever annoys me that day.  Feel free to post, or if you prefer contact me at:  urlLink druss_40@hotmail.com  and while we are on the subject of links check out these local links.  urlLink www.hornblowerpub.co.uk  a local pub that has seen better days and used to be run by the most repellant human being ever called Ken Bates. Alas to this day the pub has not recovered from his rule, which is a shame really. The Hornblower used to really rock in it's day, bikes parked outside and music you could hear a mile away! Now run by a nice bloke called Alan.  Other pubs in Newport that are good are the Hereford Arms, worth a look on a Friday night, and The Carpenters Arms in Maindee.  urlLink www.thisisgwent.co.uk  local news, very boring but thats Newport.  My Daily Rant. OUTSOURCING.  Man that really gets under my skin. The argument go's that the company sells up in the UK/EU/USA and buggers off to India or somewhere in order to lower costs and pass on the saving to the customer. Come on has anyone out there, and i mean anyone had their telecoms company or insurance firm send them a letter saying "Look Mr Smith we have cut your bill by £30 the quarter, because we laid off all our European staff and opened up in Bangalore employing lots of workers for £40 a week."  No the profits go to the fat cats at the top, and even the shareholders don't get much out of it. Then you have the poor bastards who having worked for a company for thirty years get thrown on the scrapheap. Then you get the errors, poorly trained staff who can't understand regional accents, make mistakes and as their 4000 miles away theres nothing you the poor customer can do except spend fifty minutes of your lunch hour on your mobile listening to Handel's Water Music! And being told that a customer services advisor will be with you shortly and your call is valuable to us..............  Try this, change your utilities, use the capitalist system against them. Lots of companies are quite happy to stay in their own country and pay a decent rate to local workers. Ask if they outsource and if they do, move on. Easy.  Well I feel better now, another post tomorrow.  Ps Sorry bout my spelling!

      Hi there one and all! First off a bit about me. Im from Newport in South Wales. My age is 38, and i'm married to a lovely woman that keeps me sane; and I work for a major finance company (Lloyds Tsb) in a sprawling industrial estate on the edge of Newport. Anyway this will be my daily rant about the country, my job, life and any other thing that is annoying me at the time..  Todays rant.... OUTSOURCING  Now i guess some of you have seen bits on the news about jobs going to India, and think to yourselves well that don't affect me. You want to bet!? Okay the company sells off it's UK assets, and fires it's staff to move to a free market economy the other side of the world.  Sure the company makes a packet, and they argue that they pass on the savings to you. Yeah right, the top cats get the money. And your insurance premiums or what ever go up again next year as per usual.  Valued staff get laid off, thus damaging the economy of the Uk, and sure they may get another job but that aint the point.  Then we have the problem of distance, it ain't a problem argue the companies. Oh yes it is, you think someone on £40 a week in Bangalore cares if you file gets lost. Also a lot of the staff don't understand regional accents, something they try to keep very quiet about. An sorry guys a few lessons sitting down watching Eastenders ain't going to cut it.  Finally we have the security issue. India is outside the EU and has NO data protection act. That's ok argue the companies your info is safe. You want to bet? I know people over here make mistakes to, but there have already been cases of employees in India etc selling bank details and other data to third parties.  So now your worried what do you do? Ok check where your ulility companies are based, ask if they outsource part or all of their work to India, or wherever, and then change companies. But most importantly let them know why your transferring. Several companies realise it's just done for cost reasons and is not secure as they claim, and are happy to support the Uk.  You have a problem in this country, you can drive to the office to see someone. Try doing that if your account details have been messed up by the office in Bangalore!  Right that's me lot.  Anyone who wants to mail me can on  urlLink druss_40@hotmail.com   a few fave links to keep you going!  urlLink www.thisisgwent.co.uk  a local paper to give an idea of my part of the world  urlLink www.angryalien.com  very funny. check it out and see.
