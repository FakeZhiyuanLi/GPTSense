      Firstly, I am totally stoked because I just talked to Matt from SNC and he said that I was awarded a $9,000 per year scholarship based on merit alone! Isn't that awesome? That covers like a 1/3 of my tuition for my entire college years! YEAH! Plus, once I can get my dad to give me the info I need for the FAFSA I can get some more money...need based grants and such. I'll probably have to take out loans but they'll be smaller ones. I'm trying to find some more scholarships and grants for the next few years because I want to owe the school the smallest amount of money possible. It looks so much more possible for me to go to college now. I've basically got $36,000 dollars to pay for school now. I don't think I'll be as in debt as I thought I would be! hehehe If I could squeeze another $36,000 out of the government, than I'll only have to pay for 1/3 of what I originally thought! I better get searching.   Secondly, I had this really trippy dream that involved me and Lance flying on this weird, black snake/dragon thing. It was a really happy, positive feeling dream though. I wish I could dream it again. It made me feel so much love and hope for the future. That probably sounds weird but oh well, I'm a weird person.   Well, I'm going to try and get a hold of Lance to tell him about my scholarship and I need to get a hold of my dad and hassle him about the FAFSA. I still need more free money!!!! hehehe

      I decided to put a few pics up from my graduation. That's was an awesome day! Just as a quick note: the only people missing from the group picture are my younger siblings Caleb and Lynne and my older brother Sean. Caleb and Lynne were at my graduation but had to leave the "after-party" early. Sean wasn't able to get the day off but it was great because he called me that morning to tell me that he loves me and wishes me the best. That made my day even brighter than it already was. I'll put up more pictures of god knows what later on. For now, I think I'll just go to sleep.

      Well...I got back from Yosemite on Thursday. I had a great time and man it was beautiful there! Lance watched our house while we were gone. We were both so happy to see each other. Honestly, I'm not sure how I'm going to handle being away from him for a month. I'm leaving for Taos on Friday night. God I'm going to miss him. But I'm coming home the day before his 18th b-day so we can celebrate together. Hopefully he's here because he's got to figure out where he's going to school. Reno has been the most often mentioned trade school. I honestly hope he does go to reno because that will be only about one hour or so from where I'll be going to school at (Incline Village, NV...north shore Lake Tahoe). I really hope that works out so we could at least hang out on a semi-regular basis. He's going to a trade school and it's year round so he can start asap but he might be on a waiting list. I just hope we can still be close enough to see each other on weekends or something. If not, that's ok. We've had a discussion about distance and such and I think we'll handle it fine. But still, I'm crossing my fingers for him to go to Reno! I have a lot of stuff to do in the next few days. I'm going to call Matt from SNC tomorrow. He called on Thursday and left a message. He let me know that I got accepted and despite me applying for the spring 2005 semester that, if chose to, I could go in the fall of this year! YAY! I need pack a little for Taos. I need to finish filling out the FAFSA. I need to apply for some grants and other financial aid stuff. I need to hang out with Lance for at least a day before I leave for A MONTH!! Sorry...just a brief outburst...I'm going to miss him. We're both just pretty busy and I hope we can make a little time for each other. Actually, why am I worrying? We always find time for each other, even if it's only an our or two. I love him so much. It's weird because there's so much change all of a sudden. I'm excited, scared, anxious, and sad all at once. Very new feeling. Well my mom wants to watch my graduation video so I'm going to go now. I'm going to go laugh at my cousin Ray's narration and eat mint chip ice cream!

      hey there......graduation was awesome. tons of family and friends and food. i had a big BBQ at my house and later i went to grad nite with lance, adam and a bunch of other friends. i wasn't planning on going but i'm honestly really glad that i did. we all had so much fun. i got home around 3:30 am and i was so exhausted because of all the activity that day. lance stayed at my house and we didn't get out of bed until 1:30 pm or so...despite waking up at 10 am. hehehehe i got back the pictures i took and they are really funny. i got some great presents too. i got about $400, a nice necklace, and a really cool digital camera. i was shocked that i got that much stuff. it's cool though because maybe i can get a tattoo with all that money! YAY! i have so many ideas for tattoos. i just need to single one out for my first one. i'm going to go to bed because i'm going to yosemite in the morning and i still have to pack so i'll write later.

      well the day has arrived and my stomach is in my throat and my gallbladder is just where it's supposed to be. i was talking on the phone with lance until 12:45 last night (but it was only a little over an hour because we started talking around 11:30). he's getting his hair cut and i'm trying to get ready. lorrie, clara, and him are going to pick me up at like noonish and head over to the school. my dad, anya, and the munchkins got into town last night at 9 or so. i'm glad that they made it safely. hopefully lance and i can hang out because we both are going to be pretty hectic later on. i told him time isn't an issue. it's grad night so my mom's letting me stay out a little later than normal. a few people i know are going to the actual grad night party thing at school. but most of my close friends opted for family fun over another day at school. i should probably eat soon so i'm not rushing later. i'm SO excited!!!!

      hey there....i'm graduating tomorrow at 2 pm. dear god...it's all happening so fast. i'm so terribly bored right now. i think it's because of all the anticipation. i'm overeager and antsy and impatient and bored. ahhhhh isn't it thrilling? it's so great because i'm sitting near my boyfriend and a couple of friends but they're all either in the row in front of me or behind me. one of my close friends is sitting like 3 rows behind me so we can't even talk during the ceremony. oh well. i'm looking forward to the whole celebration although i probably won't be able to hang out with my boyfriend afterwards. :( that kinda sucks. but we both have really big families with people coming from out of state and such so...oh well, family first. i'll write more later tonight because i probably won't be able to sleep!!

      I know! I've been bad and haven't written in about a month and a half. I was in Taos, NM with my dad and the family. I missed my mom but now that I'm back I feel a bit better. Well, quite a bit has changed since I last wrote. I decided against going to SNC. I chose instead to attend Cabrillo, the local junior college, and get my AA in two years. Much cheaper, closer to home, and I think the best choice all around. I'll write more later. I'm going to go to sleep because I've got an assessment at Cabrillo at 9 am tomorrow and I need to be well rested. I'm going to go curl up with my sweetie pie and drift off and have nice dreams. OK...ummmm....yeah...I really need sleep. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
