          urlLink Brendan Toh's new website      I've spent most of the day today creating  urlLink this  new website for Brendan... so people don't have to weed through my blog to look at stuff.   Anyway, for the past few days, I've been wanting to put this up. Take a look at  urlLink Jib Jab  , a site that pokes fun at Kerry and Bush.

      Nope... didn't stay up and fix my blog. Thought that sleep was more precious to me at the moment. Also, I've got stuff to do. So, blogging is not quite the main priority at this point.  I'm still waiting for my older brother's memory stick to come in. I can't believe that the entire computer world (even the manufacturer) are out of stock of the SanDisk Memory Stick Pro Duo 512 MB chip. I've been waiting for about 1 month... Mwave.com says that it should be in stock TODAY.... but nope... they lied again.... and pushed the date back to July 26th! I'm gonna go crazy if they push the date back once more. Liars!  My mind is mostly on my eldest brother and my sister-in-law. You see, they're having their first child. She'll be induced tomorrow. So, as you can imagine, everyone's excited. It'll be the first grandchild in both immediate families. I've no clue yet to what they're gonna name the baby. (They're both mum about it). Well, at least we all know that he's a boy.  I guess that I'll just have to wait like the rest of them before I unleash that crazy-aunt thing in me.

      I've finally managed to customize my blog, making sure that it works on Safari, Mozilla, Firefox and Netscape on the Mac. Mac's version of Internet Explorer REEEAAAAALLLY sucks... it doesn't show my sidebar correctly when using it. (Yes... I'm using a Mac.)  I have yet to check my weblog on a PC just yet, cuz I just don't want to turn my PC on - takes too much work to hook up all the cables. (I've not turned it on for about 2 years.... probably won't work anyway due to lack of love)  So, after making template edits for about 7 hours before, I spent another hour or two trying to fix how it looks on IE. Apparently, the sidebar I chose won't show due to Internet Explorer being stupid. Oh well. I like this template, and don't care about you Mac IE users out there. So, those who are viewing it on a Mac - too bad for you. I've spent well over 9 hours trying to make it work on all browsers and I don't think that I'll waste the rest of my weekend working on this anymore.  For those out there who don't know what I'm talking about, I've included a picture of what it looks like on Internet Explorer.... on a Mac). Now, I've not really looked at it on a PC just yet... and if I find out that it looks bad on a PC too, I'm boycotting Microsoft!    urlLink

      Tonight, I've decided to join the rest of the world in having a blog... talk about trying to keep up with technology - I feel like I'm one of the last few ancient, 20-something-year-olds to create one.
