        Greetings   Earthlings    Yesterday I was watching television when i noticed a promo for a "Family Guy" Marathon on Fox. I wondered to myself if this could be the return of "Family Guy" after a couple of years of hiding. So i checked out the website and lo and behold a new season premieres sometime next year.      These are some more shows returning to television some time this year or the next.      Family Guy: I know i've already talked about this a bit but who would'nt be excited about the return of the "Griffins", Family Guys chief family of notice, also one of the funniest T.V. families. This hilarious family is made up of the two adults Peter, who has a stupidit problem, and Lois, Peter's calm wife who can have a good long crazy attack. Then there's the three kids starting with Stewie who's always out to get Lois, then there's Chris who's stupidity is almost ten times as strong as Peter's, and finally theres Meg, who nobody ever seem to notice, especially her family. Last but not least there's Brian the talking dog of the family, he may not be a human but he's the smartest, most sophisticated character of the show.      That 70's Show: This Groovy show takes place in Point Place, Wisconsin almost thirty years back. It's a show aboot six teenagers who always do something time and time again. The six teenagers are Eric Forman, whos calm, afraid of his dad and really into Star Wars, Donna, Forman's girlfriend and the strongest of the group, Kelso, the idiot of the group, without him the show would be pretty weak, Hyde, Kelso's best friend who has no problem beating on him at all, also the rebel of the group who always gets them or himself into trouble, Fez the foreigner of the group always trying to get with the ladies, last and least Jackie, Hyde's girlfriend and the talking annoyance of the group.      The O.C- Not much to say about The O.C. except wicked show returning this November 4th on Fox. It takes place in Newport Beach, California and it stars Ryan Atwood the abandoned rebel of the group, who was taken in by his attorney Sandy Cohen, Marissa, Ryan's girlfriend and Sandy Cohen's next door neihgbour, Seth Cohen, Sandy's son and Ryan's best friend in Newport and the nerd of Newport, and lastly there's Summer, Seth's girlfriend and a person like Jackie from That 70's Show.      That wraps it up, stay tuned for more entertainment and keep a look out for these shows and more on Fox.   Shoutouts to my friends Mitch and Kyle the Hyde and Chris of the group of the Group.
