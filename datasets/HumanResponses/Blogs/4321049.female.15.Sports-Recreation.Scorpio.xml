       Grade 8 was the beginning of a new life 4 me, going to high school meeting new ppl, making new friends.  At first i thought wow i cant do this i was nervous and scared as hell but now im going in to grade 11 at Reynolds...and everythings awsome  i wouldnt want it ne other way. i have a group of really close friends, we are there 4 eachother no matter wut happens. This past year (Grade10) was one of the hardest but best years. I went through alot of friend problems with them cutting themselves and doing way to much drugs. then came boyfriends kelsey got WILL but cheated on him with Nick now that her and will broke up nick and her have been 2gether 4 it seems like 4ever. Then there was me and Reid everything was going great , so i thought we broke up in like 2 weeks.well thats when i started to realize drugs hehe...well mostly weed..i guess u can say i went though a little stage...ok a long stage that just ended...i did shurms and weed and hash oh im sick of it  Well like a month later i liked his best friend Doug so much he was so amazing..he apartenly liked me too and tahna tried smuch to get us 2gether. it almost work when he kissed me but that doesnt matter now cuz sumthung happend and it didnt work out. i was upset etc...then as summer started me and reid started agian that last about a month and a half...but was kinda a bad realtiongship cuz we never really saw eachother...but there was this guy named Jake who is an amazing guy hes funny smart and loves country music the thing is bout him he doesnt like ppl so i couldnt take him ne where if we ever went out unless he changed 4 me. but thats not likely   but he listens to me and makes me laugh hes so awsome..i only wish he would change a bit,   now that dougs with tiff on and off 4 like ever its hard cuz i still really really have feelings 4 him.. i dont even know y i mean he says he loves tiff so much and i believe him and all but then y would he kiss me in the mcdonalds play place...but oh well i guess we were both upset cuz me and reid just broke up and he was having problems with tiff...so i guess we can just say that never happend...even tho i really wish it would...then theres levi ohhhhh little levi....hes so adorable and in the summer at lanas movie night there was alot of kissing at that party lets just say...even tho i was with reid i never saw him so i didnt think it was wrong...i guess it was i dunno...but 4 some strange reason levi could be a good bf to have around but i dunno im just really confused and wish doug and tiff would make up there mind on if they want to be 2gether or not. Thats not my bussniess tho so it doesnt matter...I cant wait till school starts. Grade 11 wow a few more years then im outty!
