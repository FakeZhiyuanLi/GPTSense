      Ooh, our marks come out today. I get to go in and see how I did on my exams. I had a nightmare last night that I failed every single one. Not good.  On a more positive note, I posted the last chapter of "Uh-Oh, Boredom!" at fanfiction.net. Look me up at http://www.fanfiction.net/profile.php?userid=533098 if ya wanna read it.  Ciao.

      Bonjour! Ah, school is finally over. Report cards out on Thursday and then SUMMER VACATION! WOO HOO!  I spent the weekend at a friend's house, watching hours upon hours of Deep Space 9 (for all those who don't know, it was a Star Trek saga that started in '93) and eating marshmallow/chocolate s'mores Pop-Tarts. Wow. It was soooooo much fun! It was so fantastic to see as many episodes as I could. I'm really starting to love Star Trek. But I'm not obsessed...yet. Those things sneak up on me like a bad sneeze. Only less sticky. ^IMAGE^ *shudders* Ewwwwwww...maybe not. Ciao!

      Yay! I got my exams done...my essay got 92.5%...I went downtown with my friend Stan...got Hellsing vol. 3 (THEY MADE PIP FRENCH ALL OF A SUDDEN!!! WTF IS UP WITH THAT?)...got some new Manga art books...woo hoo! I love my life (huggles self) Yay!  I now have no more school until 7 September of this year. Summer is upon me like the tanning lotion...I am so hitting the beach this summer. I want to swim a lot more than last year.  I also want to get started on a longer-running doujinshi (hence the new Manga art books!) and really get a head start on my language arts courses. Francias, anyone? (In the middle of backwoods Quebec, our cottage resides. They don't speak French. They speak Quebecois. It's like Hicksville, Quebec.) And German. I need to do better next year.  Oh, the humanity... Ciao!

      Good evening.  Yay -- chapter 14 of "Uh-Oh, Boredom" is up on fanfiction.net. Check it out. My stories are getting better all the time. Better, better, better...ha ha ha. You get that joke, don't you Eric? Oh, well... Tomorrow is my last exam...thank God. I thought they were never going to be over... the only one I was worried about was Chemistry...yeah, sure.  Tomorrow is also the release of Hellsing #3...I am so going to get that. But on Friday if I can hop on the subway to Chinatown I'll get it there. It's always cheaper there. Kewl stuff can be found if you know where to look.  Also, I've finally gotten off my lazy butt and decided to do those d*mn paper dolls I've been talking about...I'm almost done series one.  That'll be fun.  Ciao.
