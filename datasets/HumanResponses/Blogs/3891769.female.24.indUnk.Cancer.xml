      I have no idea of what I should be writing here. I started this blog today because I was bored and I thought..."Hey! I shall start a blog!!!!" Thanks to my boyfriend, I managed to get one started. Only now, I am blogging stuff, and nobody will be reading it. So this is all pretty much a waste of my time. Oh well.

      So I turn 24 next week. Eek. One year away from a quarter of a century. Eek. Let me ask you...where has the time gone? It seems like just yesterday I was playing with my Barbie dolls, and running around in pigtails like I didn't have a care in the world. And now...now my Barbies have all been sold in a yard sale, and I never wear pigtails. Nor do I run anymore, for fear I will drop dead of a heart attack (not really...I'm just out of shape and lazy). &nbsp; So anyway...I can feel my biological clock ticking. Ticking away. Practically everyone I went to high school with is now married or has children, or both. But they're all just kids! No, wait...they're  not &nbsp; kids anymore. It's so hard to think of myself (and them) as adults. It's just not possible. I mean, one of my friends from high school is 25, and she just had a baby a couple of weeks ago. But she does not&nbsp;seem like she is 25. I keep thinking of her as that teeny bopper girl in high school, who loved New Kids on the Block.  She  had a baby?! What the...?! It's so hard to believe, really. It all seems surreal. Everyone is growing up. Including me. Yet...I feel like I'm standing still. I have hardly evolved since high school. I'm not married. I haven't had a baby. I don't have a career. It's like I am frozen in time. All around me, time is ticking away. I can hear it, see it, and feel it tick on by, but I'm not doing anything. Oh look at me....I'm rambling. &nbsp;  Tetanus Update #...3? 4?  Eh...anyway...my jaw&nbsp;still hurts a bit. And it's still a little stiff. But maybe it's gotten better. I'm not sure. I should knock on wood when I say that. I've never understood how knocking on wood has any significance whatsoever, but I say it all the time nonetheless. Look! I'm rambling again! I think I need to go find something to do.

      This place is all changed around. I guess it's supposed to make things easier, but...I don't like change. Change is bad. But oh, look -  I can write in&nbsp;green text . Sweet.&nbsp; &nbsp; I am talking with Keitha on AIM right now, and she's all, "I don't have a preview button! I don't have the list of fonts and sizes!" and I'm all, "Sux 2 b u!" and she's all, "Grrrrr." Why did Blogger have to go and change everything around like this? It's been changed for the better for me, but not for her. I feel bad, because I just know she must be hella jealous of me. Keitha, if you're reading this, don't be hatin'.

      ...that I had not produced a blog post yesterday. He was concerned that maybe my devoted readers (all 4 of you) would think I was dead...you know, that I had finally succumbed to the tetanus. But nope - I'm still alive and well. Well,  alive  anyway. Yes...my jaw still hurts. It must be the TMJ I have, since I have the neck/back pain and headaches to go along with it. I really hate my jaw. If I could change one thing about my body, it would be my jaw. Wait, no. Scratch that. I am way more vain than that. I would change a physical feature first.  So it's Thursday, and it's my day off. So far, my day has been boring. I brought my car in this morning to have the CD player checked out. It took the d00ds about an hour and 20 minutes to "diagnose" the problem. I have no idea what the problem was (they don't tell you these things), but they said they are ordering me a new radio. w00t. And it's all free, since it's still under warranty. Life is good.  Other than that, eh...just the same old same old. I added a new person to my favorite people list over on the sidebar.  urlLink Bada Bing  was nice enough to take the time to read my blog and comment, and this is his reward! So whoever reads this, go check out  his  blog please. And also, if you could maybe check out  urlLink my boyfriend's blog  and  urlLink my pal Keitha's blog , I am sure they would greatly appreciate it.

      5:52 a.m. Do you know where your children are? Oh, they are asleep. So why am I awake? Oh yeah. Work.  Just a quick recap. My jaw: still in pain. I'm beginning to think it might not be tetanus. Rather, it must be...I dunno...some other life-threatening jaw disease. It was nice knowing you all. Wait...who exactly are  you all ? I mean...who besides  urlLink Nathaniel ,  urlLink Keitha  and  urlLink anonymous  actually read this blog?

      It goes a little something like this:    Fiona and Roberto met each other at a coffee shop. Fiona was very beautiful, and Roberto was very muscular.  "Hi, I'm Fiona," said Fiona.  "Hi, I'm Roberto," said Roberto.  They were very attracted to each other, so that night they went out on a date. Later that evening, they had sex with each other.  "That was fun," said Fiona.  "It sure was," said Roberto.  A few weeks later, Fiona realized that she was "late".  Oh dear,  she thought to herself,  I must be pregnant with Roberto's child .  She was.  One day, Fiona told Roberto. "Roberto, I'm pregnant with your child."  "Neat," said Robert.  Nine months later, Fiona went into labor and had the baby. She named him Roberto Jr.  "Our baby is cute," said Roberto. "Would you like to get married, Fiona?"  "Sure," said Fiona.  But before they could get married, Roberto went off to war.  "Oh no," said Fiona to Roberto Jr. "What if Roberto gets killed?"  But he didn't. He came home a year later and they got married.  "I love you," said Roberto to Fiona.  "I love you too," said Fiona to Roberto.   The end.

      Have I mentioned how much my jaw hurts? Oh, I have? Well, I haven't mentioned it today, anyway. So here we go, Tetanus Crisis Update #2: It's still there.  So my boyfriend started his own blog last night. I wish I could figure out how to link to it. Hm. I will have to have him show me how to do it. Again. I am so st00pid when it comes to computers. Also, one of the coolest people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting on the Internet started her own blog last night too. Maybe I will link to hers as well, once I figure the whole thing out. I should really consider taking an Internet course through Adult Ed. or something. My skills are severely lacking.

      And that is that people who talk a lot are annoying.  Oh, first, let me just give a little background here, for anyone who does not know me: I work in retail. A book store to be exact. We get all sorts of different people who come in the store from day to day. About 95% of them are annoying. And out of that 95%, about maybe 35% are the people who are annoying because they talk too much. Like the old man who came in today. He comes in every once in a while and buys porn magazines. Usually, he will talk to anyone and everyone about nothing...probably to direct our attention away from the fact he's buying Big Black Butt or something. Anyway, so he came in to the store twice today and talked our ears off. He was all, "Blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah. Blah, blah blah blah!" That was the first time he came in. The second time he came in, he said, "You know what you need to watch out for? The HIV. That is not a good thing. Liberace had a lover. He got HIV from him, and died. But before he died, he sued the guy who gave him HIV...even though he was a homo too." And then he told me how John F. Kennedy Jr. died because his wife decided to call someone on her cell phone while they were flying in the plane. Eventually, he shut the hell up and bought porn.  Okay, so here is an update on the tetanus crisis: My jaw still hurts. And my neck hurts too. And occasionally my back. How long does it take for tetanus to kill you? And can I get tetanus, even though I don't recall having ever cut myself recently? And is there a way to cure my hypochondriac-ism? Anyone?

      ...and I think I'm suffering from some sort of tetanus infection. My. Jaw. Hurts. It has hurt ever since yesterday afternoon. For no reason. Sure, I have TMJ in the right side of my jaw, and arthiritis in my left side. But no, the pain can not be from that. No, it must be something really life-threatening. Like tetanus.  Damn, I finally got around to starting a blog, and now I am going to die. All of my fans and stalkers are going to be crushed when they find out I'm gone. They'll be all, "OMG! But I was so totally  hoping to keep reading her blog, but now that she's dead, there will be no blog. OMG! WTF? LOL! STFU."  Crap...I have to go to work.

      Pictures.  I registered over with  urlLink Image Shack  and am in the process of uploading pics. So right now, I'm just testing it out. I don't really want to post pics of me just yet (I don't know why I would anyway...), so instead, here is a picture I took of the sky when I was on a cruise a couple of years ago. Eh...enjoy?

      Actually, to be more accurate, it was a  bad  dream.  In it, I was at work with my boyfriend. The two of us were working the night shift, but for some reason, my shift ended at 7:30. So another one of my co-workers came in to relieve me. As I was leaving, I was complaining to her that, "Wah wah, I have to work so late, and be in so early tomorrow, wah wah." She was totally feeling my pain. So anyway, I leave the building, and it is dark outside (uncommon for this time of the year; it usually does not get dark until well after 8 o'clock). As I start heading for the parking lot, I see a middle aged man in a parked car, with his window rolled down. As I started approaching him, I notice that he is watching me. I begin to feel a little uncomfortable. I make the mistake of glancing at him as I walk by, and he starts talking to me from inside the car. I don't remember what he was saying - probably something that a stranger might say to another stranger (like, "Nice weather we're having, huh?"). I just sort of smiled at him and continued on my way. As I walked by and got pretty far away, I noticed that he had gotten out of his car. At first, I thought he was going to go into the mall. But then I hear his voice behind me say, "Hey." I didn't even look back. I knew he was following me, so I wanted to get into my car as fast as I could. I quickly opened my car door, but unfortunately, there was a car parked very close to mine, so my door wouldn't open very far. Luckily, I'm skinny, so I was able to squeeze in, but of course, that slowed me down some. I went to reach for the door, to close it, and I saw the man approaching the side of my car. My plan was to close the door and hit the lock - which would lock all of the doors simultaneously. I just had this terrible feeling that this man was going to do something bad. But before I could even close the door, I woke up from the dream. And I not only woke up, but I woke up  shivering . Not because I was cold (it was quite warm here last night), but because I was  scared . Don't you just love waking up from a dream, feeling the same emotion you were feeling right before you woke up? So I looked at the clock, and it was about 2:30 a.m. Part of me wanted to return to the dream, to see if I managed to escape, but then I wouldn't want to return if I  didn't  escape, because I'm guessing the rest of the dream wouldn't have been very fun.  So what does this dream mean? Is it predicting something that is going to happen in the future? Or, is my subconscious trying to tell me that I have a fear of getting kidnapped in a parking lot? If it's the latter, then I say... Well, duh .

      I have nothing to say.  Oh, come on - don't act so surprised. You should know by now that I never have anything to say. I mean...I never died from tetanus. Ever since my jaw got feeling better (although, it hurt a lot today), I can't really complain about my health. And ever since I got the whole template thing worked out, I can't complain about how my blog looks. And since my birthday got over yesterday, I can no longer complain about how my birthday is slowly approaching. Hm. I notice that when I have nothing to complain about, I have nothing to say.  Maybe I'll have something to say tomorrow.

      Birthdays come but once a year. THANK GOD!  So today is my birthday. I am now officially 24. So now when I tell someone I'm 24, I can actually mean it. Good-bye 23! I didn't like you anyway!

      I love  urlLink my boyfriend ! He just called me up and told me how to fix my Comments section! And it worked! Can I get a w00t, w00t?!?!  I LOVE YOU BABE! I'm so glad at least  one  of us is smart!  I am so obsessed with this blog. Not  posting on it ....just flubbing with the template, mainly. Ooooh, and adding useless features such as a Site Meter and a Guestbook! Oh, and please sign the guestbook if you have time!

      I am only one step away from having my blog look exactly the way I want it to. The only problem? Well, I changed the font color to white, so that it could be read against this dark background. But somehow, changing it to white, also changed the text in the Comments section to white as well. And the background to Comments is still light blue. Light blue and white don't mix, people. So I cannot read the comments you post, unless I highlight them with the mouse. Argh. I just need to either change the background of the comments page, or the font color. AND I CAN'T SEEM TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO EITHER ONE!   Well anyway, enough of my complaining. So today is my very last day as a 23-year-old. Starting tomorrow, I will be the big 2-4. SCARY. I will miss being 23. It was a good combination of an even number and an odd number - not to mention it was in direct numerical order. Now I won't encounter that again until I'm 34. OMG. 34. That is practically right around the corner.  So how am I spending my last day as a 23-year-old? Why - I AM WORKING! YAY! 12:30 to 9:00. But hey, at least I get tomorrow off. As does my boyfriend. I'm sure he's planning some big surprise party for me. LOL.

      And it's not even my birthday!  &nbsp;  My birthday is actually Tuesday, but I am celebrating it today with my grandmother, uncle and aunt. I feel terrible - my grandmother has been back from Florida since May, and I haven't been to see her yet. I am a terrible grandchild. It's just hard to find time to go out and visit, you know? I'm a working gal. And&nbsp;she lives a ways away. And usually I have things to do on my days off, so it's hard to find the time. I'm sure she understands, but I am also sure that she is probably hurt. So you can imagine how guilty I feel about celebrating my birthday with her today. She'll most likely be giving me a&nbsp;gift of&nbsp;money, but I don't feel as if I deserve it, as I am the worstest granddaughter, like, ever.  &nbsp;  Okay, well enough about my fake birthday. As you can see, I am working on making my blog look better. Eh....I'm not sure if what I've done so far is an improvement, but it's different, anyway. Of course, I will be changing things around for a while, until I get it the way I like it. It could take a while, folks.&nbsp; Anyway, I've been so busy flubbing with the template here, I haven't had the chance to keep up with reading my usual list of blogs. However, I did&nbsp; add a link to a new blog, over on the sidebar. Her name is  urlLink Caroline , and she is way K00l, with a capital K. So be sure and check out her blog, please!  &nbsp;

      My boyfriend was nice enough to download Mozilla for me today (I'm really too retarded to do any of these computer things myself), so that is what I am using for a browser right now. And shit! My blog looks bloody awful! In Internet Explorer, it looks all nice and neat, but on Mozilla, it looks like TEH SUXORZ. So if any of my readers use Mozilla, let me just inform you that if you switch over to IE, my blog looks a lot better. I swear! What is up with that, anyway? Why does Mozilla have to suck like that?  So...yay. Monday is my doctor's appointment. I am hella excited. Hey! Maybe I'll find out I only have 6 more months left to live! I have already told my boyfriend that if I find out I'm dying, I will go on a plane trip with him. You see [for anyone who does not know me] I have a terrible fear of flying. I hyperventilate just thinking about it. I swore that I would never allow myself to set foot on an airplane ever again. But...if it turns out I am going to be dying soon anyway, I'm making my boyfriend go with me to Ireland. Ah...Ireland. Ireland is pretty. Here is a picture. Marvel at its beauty.

      For instance, like that huge lump I have discovered in the back of my throat. The one that is making swallowing diffucult. The one that could continue to grow until I suddenly can't breathe anymore. Yeah. "SURPRISE SURPRISE,&nbsp;AMANDA," says Life. It hands me a greeting card that says simply, "This is most likely something serious. Good luck with that!"  I suppose I shouldn't complain. I've been fairly lucky up until now. I had a bunch of operations when I was a baby. I was born with a blockage in one of my kidneys, so I had to have most of one removed. Then after that, the only operation I had to have was back in April, when I had&nbsp; my wisdom teeth taken out. But something tells me that this could actually be more serious than the other two. What is a lump? A lump can be many things: a tumor, a cyst, a nodule...blah blah blah. Take your pick! Personally, I don't want any of them, because&nbsp;no matter&nbsp;what, it means one thing: operation. And who wants an operation done on their throat? Well, not me! In fact, the mere thought of it makes me hella nervous. Actually, the whole situation makes me nervous. I made a doctor's appointment yesterday, to have it checked out. They couldn't fit me in until next Monday. A lot can happen in a week. This lump could continue to grow until I'm gasping for breath. And then what? Go to the emergency room? What would they do for me? They could remove it, but would that be such a good idea? Nobody even knows what it is right now. Perhaps it is something that  shouldn't  be removed. Ugh. Who knows.  I shouldn't even be talking about this, but I'm having a hard time swallowing this morning, and I can feel the lump in my throat...and it's making me&nbsp; nervous. I tend to reveal too much when I'm nervous.

      It's called  Star !   We just got it in today at the bookstore where I work. When you take off the book's jacket, on the other side of it there is a centerfold poster of Ms. Anderson herself, completely naked (with the exception of a few strategically placed star stickers).   Of course, when reading the About the Author note on the back of the jacket, it is pointed out to us that she had a ghostwriter. Big surprise.   But tell me something...does the fact that Pamela Anderson wrote a novel make you think that  you  could write one too? Cuz that's exactly what it made  me  think. In case anyone cares, I've always wanted to be a writer. I've been fooling around with it ever since I was a wee little girl. I used to write novels. Well...but I never finished any of them. I wrote them all in high school, when I was going through my embarassing teeny-bopper phase. So now when I take them out and read them, I cringe. I usually would stop writing around page 150, when it would occur to me that my dialogue sucked, my characters were annoying, and the plot was non-existent. Now, I can't even write a whole page. It's so sad, considering that becoming a published author is really my only goal in life.   But back to Pam. People...this is even worse than that time Britney Spears wrote a novel. At least&nbsp;  she  had the decency to admit that it belonged in the Young Readers' section. I'm sure the only thing keeping  Star  from being in the children's section is the sex and implants. Otherwise, I'm pretty sure it's easy enough for my friend's 3-week-old son to read. Not that he'd want to, mind you.

       I've been ignoring you lately. I'm so sorry. It's not you - it's me. Yeah...uh, that's it. No, really - it's true. I mean, look at you. What's not to love? You look great! Your format is very nice. And your colors - don't even get me started on your colors! They are magnificent! It's just...I don't know. I think our relationship has gone stale. I remember when I first made you. I wanted to post on you up to 3 times a day. I wanted everyone to read you. I wanted you to be the best blog ever.   But you're not. I'm sorry if it hurts you to hear that, but honey...sometimes the truth hurts a little. Don't get me wrong - I like you. You are, after all, my baby. I created you. I took what you were (just a boring old template) and made you into the blog you are now. So what is wrong with me? Why have I been neglecting you? Is it because I think you're boring? I suppose that's probably it. Aw...come on now, don't cry. This has nothing to do with you. Like I said before, it's not you - it's me. I just have nothing to say...and you haven't really inspired me at all.   I'm sorry to have to bring this up for everyone to read. I hope you're not embarassed. I love you, blog, I do. But seriously...I'm worried about our relationship. And if things don't change pretty soon, I might just have to dump you.   Love,   Amanda

      ...to my critically acclaimed horror novel  Scary Shit .   WARNING!!!! IF YOU HAVE NOT READ  SCARY SHIT  YET ,  DO NOT READ THIS ONE FIRST, BECAUSE YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING THAT IS GOING ON.    Here it is:  Scary Shit 2: More Scary Shit.       Scary Shit 2: More Scary Shit     by Amanda   "I can't believe it has been a whole day since Candie was killed," said Candie Barr's less-hot best friend Britney Smith. "It feels like it was just a couple of hours ago."  "I know," said Dirk Kirkland, Britney's good-looking football player boyfriend. "I can't believe she was brutally murdered by a man with a knife."  "That must have sucked," said Britney. They nodded in agreement.  "Would you like to have sex tonight?" asked Dirk.  Britney, a virgin, gasped. "OMG!"  "What?" asked Dirk.  "I can't believe you would ask me if I wanted to have sex with you! I am a virgin!" Britney exclaimed.  "Yeah, so? You have to become a non-virgin sometime. Why not tonight?" asked hunky Dirk.  "Duh!" said Britney. "There is a killer on the loose! Killers don't kill virgins!"  "Oh," said Dirk. "You're right. I guess we can wait until after this guy is caught to have sex."   LATER THAT EVENING....     Dirk and Britney went to a party. "Would you like something to drink?" Dirk asked Britney.  "Sure," said Britney.  Dirk went over and got some fruit punch. He spiked it with alcohol. He then brought it back to Britney and she drank it. After about 3 cups of fruit punch, Britney got drunk, and Dirk led her up the stairs to a spare bedroom, where he proceeded to convince her to have sex with him.  They had sex.  Afterwards, they got dressed and went downstairs, where the party had started to break up. "That was a lot of fun," Britney admitted.  "I know," agreed Dirk. "Are you ready to leave?"  "Yes," said Britney. "But first I need to go outside in the secluded back yard all by myself."  "Okay," said Dirk.  Britney went out the back door, and into the backyard, where there was nobody around. All of a sudden, Man With The Knife jumped out from nowhere and stabbed Britney in the shoulder.  "Agghhh!" Britney screamed loudly. She fell to the ground.  Man With The Knife stabbed her again in the abdomen, just as Dirk came out the back door to see what was going on. "OMG!" he yelled as he saw what had happened. Quickly, Man With The Knife ran away.  Dirk ran over to Britney, who was barely alive anymore. "Honey! You've been stabbed!"  "This is all your fault," Britney said in a weak voice. "If you hadn't spiked my drink and made me have sex with you, he wouldn't have stabbed me. I told you: killers don't kill virgins." Britney then died.  Realizing she was probably right, Dirk said, "Oops."    THE END   I'm not sure. I might make this a trilogy. It depends on how positive my feedback is.

      It is called  Scary Shit . Let me know what you think of it!   Scary Shit   by Amanda   It was dark out, and it was raining. A young, big-breasted woman named Candie Barr was hanging out alone by the pool in her backyard. She was very rich.  "I think I'm going to take my clothes off and skinny dip in my pool," she said to herself. She took off her clothes and jumped into the pool. Little did she know, a man with a knife was watching her from the shadows.  "I feel like I'm being watched," Candie said, once again talking to herself.  "That's because I'm watching you," said Man With The Knife.  "Oh, well then that makes sense!" Candie said ditzyly. But then she realized she was talking to a man with a knife in his hand. "Oh noes!" she screamed, covering up her enormous breasts with her arms. "Are you going to kill me?"  "Yes," said Man With The Knife.  "Crap!" said Candie. She got out of the pool and walked over to Man With The Knife. "Please don't kill me!" she pleaded.  Man With The Knife ignored her, and stabbed her until she was dead.    THE END   Watch for the sequal, coming soon.

      LOL  Sorry I haven't updated this blog in a few days. I've just been incredibly lazy about doing so.  So...Monday I had my doctor's appointment. It turns out the "lump" I've been seeing in the back of my throat is actually my  urlLink epiglottis . The average person can't see their epiglottis just by looking in their throat, but for some reason, I am special. So everything turned out fine there. HOWEVER, while I was there, I informed him about another problem I've been having for almost a year: every time I smile, a slight tremor occurs in the corners of my mouth. Every time I stick out my tongue, it shakes uncontrollably. I can't believe I have let this go on for nearly a year without getting it checked out. I am insane. The doctor agreed that it is abnormal, so he took some blood work, testing for an over-active thyroid, a vitamin deficiency, and he tested my blood sugar levels because there is diabetes in my family. He told me if the blood work came back normal, then he suggested I go see a neurologist.  And...of course...I got my results back yesterday, and everything was just fine. I was actually hoping things  wouldn't be  fine, because then it might have been an easy problem to fix. But now I'm going to have to go see a neurologist, and who knows what might be wrong with me? It might be something that cannot be cured or fixed, and I may have to live the rest of my life with this, with it only getting worse.  Life sucks, doesn't it?

      So today is my doctor's appointment, and needless to say, I'm kind of nervous. Of course, I am afraid he is going to take one look in my throat and tell me that I have a tumor, and that I only have about 6 more months left to live. You see, it's not only the lump that has been concerning me. I've had things going on for the past few months - things that I have ignored because I hate going to see the doctor. Now I'm just afraid I am going to find out there is something terribly wrong with me, and that it is too late to have it reversed because I waited too long to have it checked out.... *Sigh*  I need to take my mind off of this. What is a good way to do that? Oh yeah - work! I have to leave in less than an hour, and work up until 45 minutes before my appointment. I guess work is a good way to take one's mind off of something like this. At least I will get to work with my boyfriend for a couple of hours beforehand. He helps to calm  my nerves a little bit. That poor boy puts up with A LOT when it comes to being my boyfriend. And he does it without whining or complaining. He really, truly is the best thing that has ever happened to me. *kiss kiss, babe*

      I have finally written the third installment of my immensley popular "Scary Shit" series. I hope it was worth the wait!    Scary Shit 3: Twist Ending   by Amanda   One week ago today, the beautiful, fairly large-breasted woman of Dirk Kirkland's life (Britney Smith) was brutally murdered -  stabbed visciously by an unkown Man With The Knife, soon after Britney and Dirk had passionate mind-blowing sex.  Dirk was now dating Samantha Banger - the most popular girl in school. Well...the most popular now that the  other  two most popular girls in school had been hacked to death.  "I feel so sad for Britney and Candie," said Samantha. Candie was Man With The Knife's first victim, and also Samantha's half cousin twice-removed. "I truly believe they are in Heaven now, looking down upon us."   Uh oh , thought Dirk. If Britney was looking down upon them, then she probably saw him and Samantha in the shower together last night. "Yeah," Dirk said, clearing his throat, "Heaven."  "Want to go out on a date tonight?" asked Samantha. "We could head up to Lover's Lane and make out. You can touch my boobs. Again."  "Uh..." said Dirk nervously. "That sounds great. But is it such a good idea for us to be roaming around after dark, with a serial killer on the loose?"  Samantha shrugged. "Sure, why not?"  "Okay then," Dirk said.    LATER THAT EVENING...    Dirk drove up to Lover's Lane, where he would eventually make out with Samantha and touch her boobs. He parked the car. They were the only ones up there that evening.  "I'll be right back," said Samantha flirtaciously.  "Okay!" said Dirk excitedly. He couldn't wait to touch her boobs.  Samantha got out of the car. Dirk realized afterwards that it was very stupid to let her go out into the dark, menacing, isolated world without him, but he had complete faith that nothing bad would happen to h-  "AGHHHHH!" somebody screamed.  Dirk recognized the scream as Samantha. "Oh noes!" he cried. Quickly, he exited the car and followed the screams. As he ran, terrible thoughts ran through his head - what if something bad happened to Samantha? He wouldn't get to make out with her. He wouldn't get to touch her boobs. Well actually, he could still touch her boobs, even if she were murdered, which was cool.  "I'm coming sweetie!!!" he yelled bravely.  Finally, he found her...on the ground...completely still. "Oh no," he muttered. "You've been murdered!" He  frowned. He  paused for a moment of silence, in memory of Samantha, and then reached out to touch her boob.  But before his hand could reach her bosom, a hand shot out and grabbed his arm.  Her  hand. Samantha's hand.  "WTF?!" said Dirk in a very confused voice.  Samantha smiled up at him, and then her other arm shot out. Her hand was holding a knife.  Dirk gasped frightenedly and jumped up  and backed away from her. "OMG! Samantha! What are you doing with that knife?"  "I'm the killer," said Samantha.  "Oh," said Dirk. "But why? Why did you do it?"  "Because," said Samantha. "I wanted to be the most popular girl in school. Candie was the most popular girl, so I killed her. However, I had no idea that her death would mean that  Britney  would then be considered the most popular girl. So...I killed her too. Now  I'm  the most popular girl in school! Yay!"  This all made sense to Dirk. "Okay. So then why are you going to kill  me ?"  Samantha laughed. "Oh, I'm not going to kill you, silly. Look! This knife isn't even real! It's one of those retractable rubber knives! LOL!" She stuck the retractable rubber knife into her abdomen and laughed.  "OH! Hahahahaha!" Dirk said in relieved voice. He and Samantha started walking back towards his fancy, really expensive car. "So...wait a second. There is still something about this whole thing that is bothering me."  "Yes, snookums?" Samantha said, giving Dirk a peck on the cheek.  "Well...the killer was always described as a male...you know...The  Man  With The Knife. Why is that, I wonder?" Dirk looked confused.  Samantha smiled. "Oh. That. Right. Well...you see...I used to be Samuel Banger. I got a sex change two years ago. So technically...I am a man."  " Ohhhh ," Dirk said, starting to understand it all. Suddenly, he felt very sick to his stomach.   The End.
