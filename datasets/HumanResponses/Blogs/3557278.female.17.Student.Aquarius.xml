						   ah i don't want to think about it. I feel like i'm wasting time... i don't want to think about 'wat could have been'(lol DEEP elle) but im  TIRED and STRESSED.  This house doesn't help . i seriously wonder if people give a shit sometimes. YES ur prob reading this like "oh come on! quit complaining!" but yeah. i don't know it's just little things that accumulate. its so weird. my parents dont seem very parental (lol only in themost inconvenient times). i mean, in all honesty, people at school know more about wats goin on with me than ur parents.  yesterday i showed my dad my bio assessment (which i got freaking 94% for) and he just brushed it off in 2 secs like "see when u put work in..." (like i don't normally???). i don't know, its kind of like im just 'here' and i happen to live in the same house lol. ok weird. and now i am getting hassled about getting a job.  G-R-E-A-T.  I DUNNO. i need help. lol. im run down... i'm trying to get rid of this stupid cold but im running around studying, hockey, etc etc...  i need a PARENT not a friend  atm. my mums just... i dont know. but u know how parents do... uh for lack of a better term PARENTAL things, lol. like help with dinner, wash ur clothes (lol), make sure ur not SICK etc. well this is shit. im going to hockey tonight (yeh dont ask me how my shoulder is b4 i go... or if my cold is going away,)AND i get home and have to make dinner. like wtf? i need to study and stuff. they bend over backwards for stupid private school brother ungrateul dickhead. while i cook and clean. yay!

						   today was good and crap... well not really crap, but nothing exciting happened. i couldn't get much work done because, i couldn't concenterate. i need impetus! lol... but guess what? i got 47/50 for my biology assessment - thats 94%, yay for me! ::dances::  but ugh i have soooo much work to do. i swear i'm going to have NO life these holidays because i'm just going to be doing school stuff. EXAM NOTES, PRACTICE PAPERS, MY DAMN PIP!!! ugh! teachers must think we have an insane ammount of free time! I spose they want us to do well, but come on! Today ms L (that sounds so odd) said to me "yeh get ur dad to give u all the catholic school papers!" I'm sure that would go down juuust great. Anyways, I wonder how many people in our grade will actually study? Hmmm, interesting. (not that many ppl care wat i do anyways cos i'm not... hmm lets not go there lol)  anyway off to do my homework :(  bye bye...  ELLE  PS: please don't hesititate to comment and make me feel extra special, lol.

						   Isn't it funny  how you never really screamed at my face , but your anger so unspoken and unchannelled permeates my essence  to the point where I Don't want to see you hear you, be anywhere near you, you probably think I'm threatened by you but your illusionary power doesn't threaten me  Actually I think it's kind of funny that you create an illusion that is a mirror, I don't appreciate you and I know that that surprises you I suppose you see that those who follow their heart always win, those with integrity have won the match before it's begun   Chorus  So rather than being kicked around, I'm going to kick you to the curb So rather than being pushed around, I'm going to push you away first  So rather than trying to protect you, I'm going to cover my basses first So rather than trying to open my heart, I'm going to lock it with a key So that only the special ones, so that only the special ones, can ever get through to me   Some can see beyond the barrier of threshold whereas others can't see beyond their sculptured mould, you could offer me nothing, you could offer me nothing that I need  Do you think I'm asking too much? A kind of respect and trust that shouldn't even be questioned, how can I open my heart with dishonesty sitting next to me?  I've honoured your honour to the point of embarrassment, but innocence in the hands of the guilt-free is kicked to, is kicked to the curb  I was ashamed of my innocence, I was ashamed of my innocence but now with clarity I see that your bullshit is just not worthy of me   Chorus  I don't want to be angry.... This is not worthy of me and now with clarity I see that I can walk away, I can walk away

						   Yeah ok so that sounds lame... but whats with all these little 13/14 year olds with no manners and bad attitudes. Take example, my brother... ok maybe not :P  Anyway, the example i was going to give was my neighbour. (Ooops sorry if you are reading this somehow.) Anyway as you probably know i went on the bronze hike this year to help out, and get my community servive hours up. Most of the year 9s were a pretty cool bunch once we got out there (very different to us back then, though). But i was helping *someone* do her log book and it said:    ...then went to sit down under neath a blue tarp that the teachers had set up for us.... we all sat around and listened to the teachers give us lectures on safty and lots of boring things to do with bush craft...no offence but it was boring.After that exciting 2 hours .....took some photos we all headed back into camp where we got another boring lecture on bush craft.   how  rude ! I'm sure the teacher who is  giving up their time marking  that is going to appreciate having their effort/time being called 'boring'. ugh! They need to know that stuff before they go into the bush anyways... if you don't want to pay attention then be my guest and get lost! oh yeh and he msn name is like "im a bitch... ill kick ur ass" or some shit.  haha i'm really sorry if you read this. you probably thnk i'm a bitch if ur reading it.  I shouldn't be so harsh though. The rest of the group was pretty kool. hehe they gave us a really nice thankyou note.  toodles  PS: i finished my SAC assessment, yay.

						   Something corporate are cool! Yeah, lol James if u are reading this i think you have started something :P... i heard them play AGES ago! like on some random website or maybe triple J - i think it was "punk rock princess". yeah, it was. Well i remembered i liked them after jen told me :-)  Anyway, i'm doing this society and culture assessment. it's so hard sitting her practically forccing myself to do it. i feel like i'm repeating myself... ahh course concepts. woot.  Oh yeah, what i was going to say was... my stupid brother and his stupid school run the duke of ed scheme. that shits me to no end, because they do a lame ass easy version of it, while we go freaking trekking through the bush AND we get the same credit for it. lol, i wouldn't trade the hikes for the world, but man! it's so annoying, he wouldnt be able to hack any of the greystanes hikes. ha. stupid spoilt boy. nobody here understands cos they've neva been on one. ah well. ggrrr brother...

						   spoke to  him  tonight. things are so weird. so very very weird... i hate it, its "you did this! me me me!"  enough of that. let's just forget about it. ok? ok.   I think I'm just  over tired ... i don't really want to talk to anyone, so that probably makes things worse. Nobody here has asked me what's wrong though, and i'm not one to say "hey guess what i'm upset because of...." sometimes its like you have to pry it out of me. I had an okay afternoon, i went driving that was ace, but then i came home and my dad made dinner for  everyone  else  but  me. So when mum came home he gave her dinner and i was still making mine. so i watched big brother, ate alone and my IQ dropped 10 points in the process (Grettle Kiliene or however you spell it is so annoying!).   once again i'm being a drama queen but it's my blog i can write what i want :P. anyway, last night i told my dad what i got in my extension results and he was like "oh ok" in a kind of non-serious tone... and then proceeded to give me a 10 minute explanation of some parent who called him about their stupid son's woodwork project - wow some spoilt private school boy stuffed up their project. boo hoo.  argh! i just feel so mixed up at the moment! My (now non-existant) job, school - HSC!!, my family and my stupid shoulder... everything seems up in the air. i feel like crying and i don't even know why. i don't even feel like i can talk to anyone here. I'm running on the spot with school stuff. i have alot to do, but i can't be bothered tonight. I don't want to burn out, but i really can't be bothered doing anything... im not hungry buti feel lazy for doing nothing. i think i wanna run, but im too tired.  someone tell me what to do?

						   Until i start my homework. I wrote out a little schedule for this arvo because i have lots to do.  Stuff for bio, maths, PD, and SAC. So tonight  should  be pretty productive. I'm in a working mood, which is good :) and it will let me concentrate on stuff to actually use my time effectively... and not think about stuff thats gonna make me sulky etc. whoa longest sentence ever!  I'm drinking 'cookies and cream' flavoured tea. its yummy :) I love tea, its so relaxing. i need to relax atm, lol.   One other thing we really need to do is yearbook stuff. I'm glad we are doing it because i want a good yearbook, to remember everything, but classes arent handing in their pages >:( bah, very irritating. People don't realise that we neeeed their input too! It's kinda rude when they just expect a yearbook to appear out of nowhere. we can't throw in pages that dont exist... aaaaanyway my rant over. i need to go write about the immune response  toodles  oh and one more thing... i got 80% on my extension speech. i feel a bit ripped off, but its not a bad mark.

						   LOL the Simpsons is classic. Aaah, i just did my biology and maths homework so i need a break :)  Today wasn't that exciting. I had a free first and then this src presentation thing where we got a badge, they did give us free food though :) Yeah... hmmm what else happened? Well my extension assessment went fine! I'm happy to say. My speech was 4:22, meaning i was the only one in the alotted time, and my improvised speech was 1:28. i think i went pretty decent and i addressed all the issues i needed to. yay ;)  I have bad hair today :( i loved it when i first got it done, all silky, blonde and straight! I wish my hair would blow dry straight easily. aaanyway. not being shallow or anything, lol.  Tonight i'm going to do my society and culture assessment task - inequality in gender. I get to use stingers :) but I have to write my dukes log book too...booo! I'm not looking forward to it. i better go hunt down my notes. wah  see yas

						   I'm so confused (hence the title). I'm so annoyed!  I'm sick of my stupid stuck up relatives... they are lost in their own materialism... they  used  to be normal! Now all they care about is their honda 4WDs and plasma screen TVs. It's all one big competition... but it aint gonna make them happy. They frustrate me... never do anything to help others or their problems or what goes on in the world, its all about whos got the shinest car or ring, or new TV or rennovation. Ha - the CRV that hasnt left paradise (the streets of corlette) - of course they  need  that leather interior. They live in a bubble... and they arent interested what happens down here - after all, we don't live in corlette so what does it matter? guh! they have such... unfulfilled lives.  I'm sick of people having no priorities! They are just happy to sit back and pretend the worlds problems don't exist...  Money just screws everything over. it's why my stupid rellos are so pretentious. it's why i lost my job - wow max you get extra money of tafe. nevermind the chick u hired is a total ditz. Now i don't know what to do. i dont have enough time and energy to spend finding a new job! I'm doing my HSC for beeps sake. But i hate having to get my money from my parents. My dads dead set against it, but my mum said she'd give me money. I hate this! i don't want to be a charity case :( and i want to be  independent ... but i got thrown out on my ass. I spose i have to accept help from my mum... but i feel like such a scab.  I hate this!!!

						   YES i realise i am being an over-dramatic drama queen here but i dont care!! maybe its a combination of a lack of sleep and just consecutive shit events but yeah... argh!!!  Stuff has just been soo overly crap at the moment. I'm *trying* to not let it get to me... eating and sleeping right, trying not to get stressed over it and stuff. but ugh i'm just so over it.  I keep thinking about that stupid stupid stupid person. that  seriously  harshly pissed me off. "whatever" my "problems are" i should talk to "someone" ( yeh heaven forbid he asks wats up . before, of course, i "take it out" on him. thats such a ducking joke! Oh, my bad... i forgot i 'm disturbed. silly me! he toally sickens me now. yeah i know its lame.   I just dont know where to turn... im stuck in the middle again. not so much now, things calmed down after avoca and everyones cool again, but yeh sometimes it feels like everyone has just trivial stupid crap to worry about. i dont even feel like talking to anyone at home. it just doesnt feel supportive at all..  then on friday i got this lovely message from my ducked up boss.  i felt sick for like the whole of friday night, but that was also out of stress because i just kept thinking about things... and i lost my job. yeah way to find out too, on VOICEMAIL!!! argh! fcuk that, it wasnt my fault. i expect a damn fricken good reference from that pot smoking rich-ass tosser. I keep telling myself that its okay, because I'M not the one who's gonna be stuck THERE for the rest of my life. i mean i don't see my future working there. I was so pissed tho, because i found out off the chik whos working sundays now... i mean my 'boss' (who couldnt organise himself out of a paper bag) didnt even call me! SO i called work and spoke to this stupid girl who works there, and she was  so  condescending. you know those people who talk to u on the phone at a shop or something and try to sound nice, but are  so  totally insincere? ugh! so then i left a message for him to call me, and 2 days later i got a mesaage on voicemail saying that rachel* is working instead of me, because she needs her hours for her vet nursing course. the only reason shes doing vet nursing is cos she failed her HSC anyways. fuck that. i worked there for volunteer for like 1.5 years, and he throws it back in my fucking face because its easier for him to get a vet nurse for him to work than me. me who has been working there for ages and knows how everything is done. well he can go to hell. everyone hates him anyway :)    hmm i hope that post want too bitchy. *her name isnt really rachel but i feel funny posting real names. lol.

						   Well the weekend had some good and some bad points. We went to Avoca for Chris' 18th, it rocked :-) We stayed up heaps late and did the usual stuff, except there was NO SURF which sucked. oh well it would have totally stuffed my shoulder. OH yeah, i got a haircut on friday too hehe. mmm...yeh anyway about Avoca, it was uber fun! Mainly because i could just get away and not have to worry about anything else. it's funny because its such a little place and feels isolated, but its only about 1.5 hours from home. actually it took a lot less that that driving home, but i cant BELIEVE that the weekend is over. I'm shocked.   i'm going to have a bath and write when im in a better mood. then go to bed, try and make up for the total lack of sleep of the past few nights.  later

						   Yep, it is 6:53am and i'm on the computer. Kinda sad? Nah i had to get up early to write an essay for extention about  The real inspector hound . I couldn't do it last night, i was  too  tired. Yeah i fully don't want to go to school... i have society and culture first, then PDHPE then maths. i only like one of those 3 classes. Actually SAC hasnt been that bad lately, actually doing some work with a vague kind of meaning. Anywho, this essay is hella boring. "Stoppard effectively employs the crime fiction genre to explain the instability..." oh yeah aren't you jealous? mmm i thought so.  Yeah i should really think about doing some more of this essay. I'm listening to 'highway one' by the waifs. i like it :)  i wish i was camping again :(  i should go...

						   I don't know why i had to put capitals for every word then but whatever. This post really is a waste of space. I SHOULD be doing my extension speech but i'm tired... and blogging doesnt require much brain power. Anywho, i really really really don't want to go to work tomorrow :( I'd rather just stay at home in my PJs and do my assessments, as sad as that sounds. That's what i did today :) But tomorrow i have to work :'( thats really upsetting... but then i'm going to the footy which i probably shouldnt be doing, as i have assessment tasks and i am going to Avoca next weekend. Ah, im so crap. Oh well, I've at least started my extension speech (which is on the bone collector) and we get palm cards. I can't even start the second half anyway because its based on someone else's speech :\ i dont know if i like the sounds of that.  Bleh! The only other assessments i have are PDPHE (taping an ankle, which i can do) as well as society and culture, and i have a fair amount of time to do that. ah boo. So i suppose i'm not so crap after all, i just feel like i should be working on school stuff more... but it seems that (school)work is all i do. I'm running on the spot right now...  ciao (did i spell that right? :P)

						   Alright guys, negative Elle has left the building.  Stupid boy is out of my head. it's probably best if i never talk to him again. (telling myself this :P). He was a jerk to me therefore he can go to hell.  I don't agree with 99.9% of what my dad says, of course thats my problem because i'm only 17 therefore my opinion doesnt matter... im trying to make things tolerable for all involved but im not going to deliberately start shit (not that i do).   I'm going to be a nurse. I'm going to go to UTS and i can get the UAI i need - (81.35). Yay, i'm goint  urlLink HERE . woot!  I can reverse park.. oh yeah watch out :P (which my shoulder doesnt like too much). Anyway, hopefully i can get the physio to check it (my shoulder, not the reverse parking lol, and the more exercises i do, the stronger it will get.  Oh, and it's the long weekend :) Watching parramatta play on sunday, yay!

						    Teachers are very strange, strange... uh... people? Yeah today at lunch 2 teachers just randomly walked up to us and&nbsp;had a conversation. ehh werd. hehe.    &nbsp;  I have not posted in this thing for like 200 years! Well, since monday anyway! I've just been sooo snowed under with school work and 100 other things. but the good news is that on monday i can hand in my PIP and forget about it! That is, forget about it until i recieve an award for it being so excellent. HAHA please note i am NOT being serious.    &nbsp;  Anyway i spose today was alright, and i was actually PRODUCTIVE in maths *gasp*! Its nice and sunny too :) I'm going for a drive too at 3:30... once again i havent been in about a week -- damn being busy. I really don't have much to report, things are going ok, ive been a bit stressed out lately but we are going to the football tomorrow to see the Eels vs. Tigers. I REALLY hope we win.... but i will not get my hopes up :P Poor Parra :(.     &nbsp;  Ok i just told Jen i was hungry and realised how often i say that.    &nbsp;  Anyway i better get going, i wanna finish my stupid pip reference list before my lesson. ha.    &nbsp;  seeyoubye

						    I&nbsp;am listening to something corporate. Today was... a waste. I missed out on CHS by one freaking place, so close too :( And now im cut cos i feel lazy, i dunno shoulda trained or warmed up or something (or cooled down after hockey hehe, the reason y my legs were cactus). THEN the relay -- we could have easily made it -- the 1st runner just pulls out and goes home. no particular reason. Gee, what a team player.    &nbsp;    Oh well who cares - im not at school for athletics, i'm there so i can get into uni. bigger and better things... not that i hate school or anything. i'm gonna miss it but thats another story. I have nothing of any great interest to post.     &nbsp;   seeyoubye

Everyone else is in biology at the moment. Except for kate who is probably asleep, as she has a free period. I would like to be asleep atm :( Don't wanna go. Ok i'm gonna do the whole convincing myself it will be great thing... ok! i'm ready!!! Let's go it will be *great* fun.    &nbsp;  Yeah!    &nbsp;  ps: suggestions re: uni courses people!!!

						     I think one of the hardest things you can do is forget about somebody who you have called a 'friend' for a long time, especially when they are so freaking&nbsp;blasé about it. I&nbsp;can't let this get to me. It's not worth it.&nbsp;I spose i just have to forget all the crap he said, and not take it to heart. Easier said than done, when it was @#$% like... "ur so trapped in ur own little world where everything revolves around you its funny" or how about... "for sum fuked up reason i actually cared about you" or maybe... "totally different, totally nice and didn't eva look down or shit on ne one, and u actually used 2 be friendly 2 ppl".     &nbsp;   All i ever did was help or listen. It's not my fault that you stuffed up or whatever. All this time you've taken out your shit on me. I never had any bad intentions or tried to 'look down on you'. When i hadnt spoken to you i msged you, but you didn't reply. As if you'd talk to me at school anyway, my groups&nbsp;prob too "different", or youre just too hard done by, too busy acting like a drama queen. How many times had i been there for you?  &nbsp;Well i don't care im not going to be a doormat when you come and want help again. I don't need that crap thrown in my face again.    &nbsp;   GOODBYE     &nbsp;   ps: i realise its kinda immature saying this on my blog, but i dont really care if he reads this, i just needed to get some stuff straight.

						    Hey everyone, hope you're all having a good day.    &nbsp;  Last night was fun, aqua golf :) Happy&nbsp;17th maris :P&nbsp;So far today, I've played hockey!!! We all played so well today, but it was a 0-0 draw. Pretty good considering Sharn couldn't play and the team we played are top of the ladder. I reckon we'll kill it. We still have one more game today, against OLMC we are gonna kick their butts :P I was pretty happy, frustrating cos we were soooo close, and now, my shoulder hurts. bah. I was proud hehe ran round lotsa people, tackled, blocked and used my backstick!!    &nbsp;  Anyway, i've been looking through my UAC guide and i've seen a bunch of courses im interested in.... here they are (not in any particular order btw)      SYD UNI  -  B Nursing/B Arts  - UAI is 88.2     SYD UNI -   B Applied Science (occupational therapy)  - UAI is 82.25     SYD UNI  -  B Applied Science (leasure and health) &nbsp; - UAI is 77.50     UTS -   B Arts in Human Movement studies, Grad Dip in Education &nbsp; - UAI is 84.25     UTS  -  B Nursing  - UAI is (city) 81.35, (umm kooringai nfi how to spell) 78.1     Well there you go. Any SUGGESTIONS?

						    I   am  so  incredibly tired right now. So tired in fact that i think i spelt that wrong. Meh. I've had a pretty crappy week, but today was an alright day i suppose. Had PD first... that was okay kinda boring. Next was SAC and i did  nothing  contructive but i learnt about footnotes and Greenie told me about his daughter -- whoa interesting... Love those footnotes. However the worst was yet to come -- i intensely  hate  maths!!! Its always so  noisy  and we get nothing done... plus it is  extremely boring ! But the crappest thing ever. i was sitting there infront of E block like we always do at lunch, and i was trying to be all stealthy and talk on my phone, lol, anyway Obi walked past and said something about me not handing in an essay for extension and i was like "oh yeh boo hhoo sir i just had a really crappy night and didnt get around to it" AND then he said  "I don't wanna hear about neil problems"  i was like WTF?!? ugh so  uncalled for . Then i had to walk around and try to get a bunch of fotos off teachers and they all wanted to  talk  and i just wanted to go to sleep..... i was just in that mood where i was all head-achy and didnt feel like talking and they just kept being all chatty about scarves and artworks and other irrelevant stuff.... which could have been possibly interesting if i was in a sociable mood.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  but now i can't sleep. :(    &nbsp;  And it's so annoying that we don't get our jerseys until the 6th of August!!! That is pathetic! I know its  not  the committee's fault - it's the stupid company. Guh, rude! OH well if i wake up soon enough tonight should be fun. no idea what is planned but involved going to maris' and then something. who knows?    &nbsp;  Yeah  Jenno , i read your blog. I can't not be friends with you, its ok now. Anyway i suppose this marks the end of my blog for today. Hope you all have a good afternoon/night. ;)    &nbsp;  See you, bye!

						      Hi everyone :)     I am undecided as to what mood i am in at the moment. I just had a driving lesson and that was pretty cool. I really like driving the echo now, as much as everyone else hates it. I'm just used to it now, know how to handle it. Oh, and Rafael laughed for like 200 years about my grandma crashing her car (ok that sounds awful but its a funny story). But another thing that is detracting from my potential good mood is....  school.  Bah! i don't want to go. I suppose it'll be alright, get to see friends and such... ok i'm gonna convince myself that it will be good. And i won't have to dread SAC because i'm finished my PIP. LOL anyone who doesn't do society and culture would have NFI what i'm talking about. Hehe, so many acronyms, so little time. OK i really am a  nerd  :P or as Kate said - nerdburger :) I like that&nbsp;word hehe.     &nbsp;   Man my brother is annoying. He just sits around and goes  "okkkkkk!!! i aaaaam!!!"  whenever you ask him to do anything. He is really getting on my nerve atm. AND he gets another week to bum around the house.. sooooo lazy. OH well i'd kind rather be around my friends, even if that means going to school. I'd hate going to his school. I hope we get our jerseys tomorrow!  that would be so cool.  I'm not quite sure why bold was necessary then, but i am sure it was :)     &nbsp;   So, as Jen was saying on  urlLink her blog , I too, feel like i have nothing much to say! and i am going to continue this post having nothing to say. It's funny how i've managed to get like 50 entries in this blog without saying too much. oh no! Guh! I swear my mum must h8 me or something because she just left to go for a walk. when i wanted to :(. no fair!!!!!!!!!!!!! :@ oh ppfff. I should go for a run or something but i just ate. I have regional/area athletics coming up soon. I'm a bit scared cos im in the 400X4 relay... yeah so a bit scary. But should be ok. I'd really like a CHS jacket. the aim was to get one thru x-country or athletics but i had to pull out of half my events cos i did my stupid shoulder in. which reminds me i have not done my exercises today :O My bad! (i say that waaaaaay too often).     &nbsp;   Well it looks like i had more to say than i thought i did. I'm off now to find my school skirt which needs to be hemmed but it won't happen because nothing in this place ever gets done..... lol damn it     &nbsp;     BYE BYE ;)       &nbsp;    listening to: 'Highway One' - the Waifs.

Wow i can write in  COLOUR HEHE. ok my bad that looks odd.        &nbsp;   Ok, so what happened today. Oh first off  MUM STOP READING MY BLOG ! yeah ok now that thats out of the way... today has been very boring actually. i woke up at about 9:30, did some washing and kinda cleaned my room. Then i made some cookies, had lunch and gave my dogs a cup of tea (lol shut up). This arvo i'm going over to  urlLink Jen's  place and we will hopefully get some yearbook stuff done... ie our group pages. we suck!     &nbsp;   Also a few things are annoying me      My email is not working!!! Outlook express is EVIL    I want my Ps and a car desperately    I have no money....    School goes back on Tuesday :(    I got a really nice reference from the vets. which is good but yeh he still sux     Ok well i gotta go do some stuff for english -- i did my king lear summary yesterday. Then i'm gonna finish this biology stuff.. woo!! i just love researching australopithecines. Oh but alot of them were vegetarian ;) (because you all care deeply)         hhhhmmm wat does this do oh my bad... blogger is full of new things  &nbsp;    Bye   for   now   hehe   big   colourful   font.

My driving lesson was pretty good yesterday actually, lol rafael said "u drive the car like ur bloody own the thing" lol i think thats his form of a compliment?  LOL I'm watching video hits and this fully sik dude just said "I aint 50 cent i'm a chinaman!! I don't speak english, i speak chinese". ok i'm turning it off now...  HMMM anyway! Today i AM going to do some of my Biology Assessment, finish my Better Health summary (almost done ;)) and then do some PIP stuff. Go me :)  OK lol, i keep thinking about tongue piercings! Damn, lol. My mum keeps joking about it, i bought some thumb tacks yesterday to pin up my assessment notification sheets and she was like "Elle, are u going to pierce ur tongue with those" hehe she's funny.  Well i should go and get around to that biology stuff. I really don't feel like it :( AND we have heaps of yearbook stuff to do.

						   lol, sorry i just noticed the sticker on my folder.  Today was ok :)Did ALOT of yearbook stuff. Hhmmm some people are getting annoyed at *some* other people, was kinda stressing me. aanyway. wat happened? ok lol i'll just recount the whole day. :P  it was so hard getting outa bed this morn :( but i dragged myself out and went to school -- the last day!!! didn't do much in PD, resulted in us talking alot, writing a bit, and me bragging about hockey cos noone ever noticed us. lol -- sir said hed put something on the sign out the front. ah we suck. lol  then i had sac. that kinda sucked but we didn't do too much... then maths - as if that could ever be fun! BUT OMG OMG i got 14/16 for the second section of our assessment (thats the only part we have gotten back yet). That equals 87.5% which i am pretty happy about because i have always hated maths and at the beginning of the year convinced myself that i sucked at it. it's all about the confidence - and not stressing too much hehe.  i'm listening to natalie imbruglia which jen so kindly burnt for me :) thanks! and thanks for the link on your site ;)     OMG i was just reading my brothers report (it was an accident, lol it was just sitting on the kitchen bench). he failed so much, his top mark was 70%. HE is the crappest. He doesn't even care how badly he is failing despite the money that my parents pay for him to go to that gay school. ugh he really irritates me - so ungrateful and lazy. he got like 40% for one of his classes. He is the smelliest! my parents fork out SO much money for his gay school fees, uniform, textbooks that he never uses etc.. and he doesnt even try! oh and he gets to go on the version of duke of ed for pansies.     ANYWAY  lol stella (dog) just went outside to roll in the grass and sneeze.   bye bye

						   Hi everyone.  Today wasn't too bad. Well it started out a bit crap, because i had a maths assessment too, but it wasn't as bad as i thought. As per usual there were a few typos in the exam :S it was stupid, but i think i went pretty decent. there was only this one stupid exponential/hyperbolic graph that i didn't know 100% how to answer but i still wrote *something*.  Then i had english... oh and we got our exam timetable for the dreaded trials. Yuck! Bio was next... pretty boring cos all we did was write an essay on quarantine, and then go find some diseased leaves... hehe, but i found a pretty leaf :)  After that was SAC, which supprisingly want *that* bad. We just went to the library, and miss gave me the class page for the yearbook. it's pretty funny and she mentions Jen & myself as the animal rights liberators or something hehehe!  THEN we had HOCKEY HOCKEY HOCKEY!!! it was SO cool! We got to play on TURF.. YES THAT'S RIGHT! WATER BASED ASTROTURF WHICH I *LOVE* PLAYING ON! hehe sorry about that i got carried away.. it's such a faster game! i love it :):):)  oh yeah, lol we WON 2 nil! yay go Greystanes - Sydney West open Hockey knockout champs.   Excellent :) the only bad thing is now i have agravated my shoulder. damn damn damn. but..... we.... WON ::dances::

						    I know what they say They tell you I'm difficult But so are they But they don't know me Do they even know you? All the things you hide from me All the shit that you do    I feel tortured, I feel that I'm all gone My heart isn't a rock.Come on baby come and steal my siesta And all that you have I was dreaming of somewhere Away from here.      You didn’t forget me…at least immediately. Cause who are you… to tell me what to do? I will unwrap him just like a present and I will discard him just when I want to thank you But I’d rather I taste my desires of Earth and fill my mind with jewels for all they are worth than discover a diamond decays to a rock and time doesn’t turn.

						   He was the dude i had to write about in extension today. I don' t know why any of you would care but that's the exam i had today and i couldn't think of a title. I can't believe i'm halfway through my trial HSC exams!! I'm wearing my year 12 jersey!!! It's going to be over soon. That genuinely freaks me out. It's also cool though... soon I'll be driving and going to Uni and doing all grown up stuff. hrrmmm  I really like Dido at the moment....and about 500 other CDS, but mainly Evanesence (lol im so cheap i burnt it :P) Missy Higgins and also Pete Murray  OH yeah! I just remembered that today is the Bronze hike that i would have loved to have gone on, despite the fact that this group largerly consits of...... uhhh..... *cough* lovely*cough* year 9s. I can't believe that there are only 16 people left! that means that 12 PEOPLE DROPPED!!! OMG!! Yeah well we thought they were a bit dodgy. Oh well there are some really nice people in the groups and there will be a good bunch who actually continue. Plus they did write that really nice thankyou note hehe  but they are going to freeze tonight.........  Hmmm it's really windy today and on that note i am going to do some study :( Maths, Biology and Society and Culture exams next week. It's going to be so hard to stay focused after the trials..

I shall be scabbing many a lift in your sexy car :P      I wish i had my Ps :( but  someone  wont let me drive. pffff....      anyway, i just got back from hockey and i dead set got tackled, barged, shoulder charged and poked threateningly with sticks about 5 times. THANKS NATHAN. Some mature coach we have! now my shoulder hurts (you know it was coming...). oh well he smells. BUT we are coming 3rd on the ladder!!! not bad considering we came up from a division below and none of our for and against was included, we'd be killing it if it was. Nevermind....       on the topic of hockey, Louisa i hope you feel better soon... and your appendix-less-ness (lol) fixes itself up soon! you better come watch us play :P hehe      anyway see ya later dudes      oh, actually one more thing: sedan echos are seriously ugly.
