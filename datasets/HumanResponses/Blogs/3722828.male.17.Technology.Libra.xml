      Hypocrisy rules the Earth.  It's a known fact, and frankly I try to stay as far away from being a hypocrite as I possibly can.  Politicians are hypocrites, bosses are hypocrites, hell, even your own parents can be hypocrites, and usually are.  Case in point.  I'm gearing up to be an IT Manager.  Anyone wanting to go into this field knows that your family proceeds to take advantage of your skills on every occasion they get, and sometimes leave you wondering if they did something on purpose to get you to fix it for free.  That is the case with my family.  I'm IT, and therefore must fix whatever computer problems arise, yet never have any control of what goes on with their computers.  It isn't fair to me.  Now then, before I continue, let me explain something somewhat off-topic.  See, I need a laptop for college.  And being IT, I've had experience with every desktop and most server platforms other than Mac OSX.  Hence, why not buy a Mac notebook for college?  Seems like a good idea, and my parents thought so as well.  This is present-day.  Flash-back to my Freshman Year of High School.  They promise to buy me whatever computer I wanted for graduation.  Seems like a good deal, no?  It was, too good to be true, as a matter of fact.  Now, let's flash-back to my Sophomore year of HS.  Due to some...'financial' problems they claim, my purchase limit will be set at $3000.  Not bad, you can get a lot of computer for three grand.  Hell, I could've gotten a 17" Powerbook for that kind of money.  Now, let's go to my Junior year.  Now they strike it down, again, to $1000.  The reason?  "We're paying for a car for you and car insurance and gas money."  Whoa whoa whoa.  Slow down there.  Let me explain something here:  1)  I never wanted the car.  I never needed it. 2)  I never asked for the car.  I didn't see a point in having a third vehicle. 3)  I never asked for them to pay my car insurance.  Yes, I was un-employed, but that could've easily inspired me to find work.  Now then, because of this car, my purchase limit was cut by 2/3.  Wow.  And this car has hung over me like a dark shadow ever since.  Now then, one more flash-back, this time to my Senior Year.  I figure, let's spend -HALF- to buy an iPod.  I spend about $500 on my iPod and accessories.  It's nice, 30GB HD, full featured, etc.  I love it to pieces, and both me, my mom, and my dad acknowledge I still have $500 left.  Now then, I factor in a bit more money for my IT services.  So after my figuring, I see that if I had done all my jobs independently, they would owe me about $170.  After I pay rent, buy food, pay for my car, pay for gas, and pay for insurance, as well as my portion of the internet.  Apparently, they don't see it that way, and they don't see that they owe me $500 still.  Now then, we're back at present day.  I'm budget-shopping for a laptop.  I see a nice 12" Powerbook G4 on sale for $1299.87 because of the latest Apple speedbumps.  That's $500 off.  I have $645 in graduation cash from other relatives.  So why shouldn't my folks chip in and help pay the other half, right?  No, apparently "They cannot afford to do that financially."  Riight...we can afford a $30,000 home theatre, but not $655 to go towards my laptop.  Uh-huh.  I, of course, protest this, and then proceed to get scolded.  Per usual, -I- am the ungrateful one in this household.  I give up, and just sulk and watch Daria downstairs.  About this time, my brother comes down to ask me for his computer help.  Apparently, he lost HAL.dll and reinstalled Windows (NO reformat.  Just re-installed windows without a HD reformat), and now he can't logon.  I tell him what's wrong, and of course since my brother CANNOT EVER BE WRONG, I am the wrong one.  So I come upstairs later, and my dad is PISSED.  My brother had apparently blew this waaaay out of proportion.  So me and him talk a bit, then my brother comes down.  He's ugly, rude, he interrupts, says I'm always wrong, claims he runs AVG and Spybot S&D everyday (Which I -KNOW- he doesn't, he doesn't even have them installed), and basically blames it on the 40GB Hard Drive I gave him, which is in perfect working order.  Uh-huh, right.  Hard Drives don't do that, it just can't happen.  SO anyways, my dad's solution?  Buy him a brand-spanking-new Hard Drive.  This sets me off now, mostly because he's yelling and siding with my ignorant brother.  I say, "You just told me we can't buy anything else!  You just said we put blinds on a CHARGE CARD!"  My dad's response?  "We can buy him a new Hard Drive because he needs it!"  I leave the room, and watch E! with my mom.  She asks me what happened, and as I start telling her, my dad walks in and tells me to stop blowing it out of proportion, to stop lying.  Right.  I was just telling the truth?  So here I am.  It's 10AM here, I won't get a laptop -at all- until I buy it myself because of these three reasons:  1)  My parents drove themselves into Credit Card debt AGAIN by buying stuff they didn't needed IE Home theatre, expensive, overly big house, new furniture. 2)  They're hypocritical IE We can't afford to do anything for you but we can sure as hell buy your brother a new Hard Drive 3)  They feel I'm ungrateful, never help out, and only think of myself.  This is bullshit.  I help out more than they know, yet my dad refuses to acknowledge that I know what I'm doing computer-wise, and always believes he's right.  I mean, he's the dad.  Dad's are -never- wrong.  It's impossible for a father to be wrong.  /rant  Peace out everyone.

      Well, here's the geek.  I kind of like this oppossed to Livejournal.  I'm just a random joe-schmoe, and have no reputation to live up to.  Nobody to offend, no groups to post on or member with.  A fresh start, so to speak.  Let me introduce myself. My name is Justin.  Justin N, for those who want a sort of formality.  Only good friends know my last name, and fewer know where I live.  Call it paranoia, but that's just how I am.  I'm a geek.  There, I said it.  So now that you know I'm a geek, you can leave if you like.  Your choice.  I build and repair computers.  What started as a hobby has now become my life.  And I wouldn't change it for the world.  I prefer doing this sort of thing, since it's like a big puzzle.  Only this puzzle happens to be hundreds of dollars or more of very sensitive pieces.  But I'm rambling on a tangent again.  Hate it when I do that.  I also play games.  I'm not biased to any particular console, also known as being a fanboi.  In fact, I own and play a PS2, Gamecube, Xbox, and Dreamcast, as well as some retro consoles.  The games make the console, not the other way around.  Anyways, I also play games on my PC.  I used to be a software pirate, but I gave that up long ago.  The thrill just kinda wore off, and I realised what I was doing was wrong.  But again, another tangent to blog about later.  Anyways, that's just my little introductory post.  I'll try to write at least weekly in this, to let my readers know what I'm up to.  Afterall, this is days in the life of a geek, right?  This is Justin, signing off.  Take care everyone.

      Wow, I haven't touched my blog in ages it seems.  And for good reason.  I've been superbly busy getting unpacked, going to a dance competition for my little sister, enjoying a sunburn-filled vacation (In all actuality it was a blast), and other goodies.  So, in detail, what's happened?  Read on.  First off, I got my iBook.  Yeap, I finally got it.  It's a 14" iBook with a Combo Drive, and an extra 512MB RAM in it for a total of 768MB of RAM.  It's running blazingly fast, and all it's missing is Office.  But I can remedy that on Limewire and a few hours or so, BitTorrent if i can get some free time.  Picked up Keynote for it as well, and now that I know the ins and outs of OS X Basics, I'm starting to dive into the Terminal and play around (cautiously) in there.  Hopefully I'll learn a lot from this laptop, and I'm already considering buying an old G4 and slapping OS X Server on it, and use it as a Fileserver of sorts.  But I'll cross that bridge when/if it comes up.  Also, I got Doom 3 now, and have been playing it to death, though I'm terribly stuck on the Guardian Boss in hell.  I know his weakpoints, but I always run out of ammo before he goes down.  I'll just keep trying, I guess.  The gameplay itself is methodically paced, and isn't your Unreal Tournament shooter variety.  You'll need to take cover and peek out around corners to survive in this game, and luring enemies into your shotgun helps as well.  The graphics are astounding, not to mention the heat haze effect, which blurs the visual area around sources of heat, like your eyes do in real life.  It's amazing, but it's a shame my video card cannot keep up with it.  Speaking of PC's, I think it's time for me to upgrade mine.  I'm currently running an Athlon XP 2200+ Processor with one stick of 512MB PC-2700 RAM, and a Radeon 9600 Video Card.  My dilema, is that I do not know what to upgrade to.  I want a motherboard with a PCI-X slot, preferably two, yet still an AGP Slot for backwards compatibility.  I also want to use my current RAM, and not have to buy new sticks, so that rules out Socket 754 and 940, if I'm right.  But Socket 939 is very expensive at the moment, and I can't seem to justify it, not to mention there's only three good mobos out for it at the moment, which makes me anxious.  Any suggestions?  Alas, it's late, so I'm gonna head to bed.  Good night, Internetland.
