      I have a problem. It doesn't matter how straightforward it is, or how overdue it is, I will pissfart around and make it take twice as long. the most notable is my Uni work. For 3 weeks now I have been trying to sit down and write an essay on Civil and Criminal Procedure. As thrilling as it is, when it comes to actually sitting down and typing my measly 1500 words, I will do everything in mw power, including writing in this blog, to evade 'real' work (Some may question University as falling within the definition of real work, but I think they should bite me).  Maybe I am self-destructive. Actually, I don't think there's a 'maybe' about it - I mean every single report card I got in primary school said "Téa takes herself for granted" or "Téa does not work to the best of her ability" or "Téa keeps chewing her chair." That sort of thing. Similarly, in high school I got "Téa does not work hard enough" -or I'd get an "A", but there was usually reluctance on the part of my teachers because of my so-called "attitude". I wonder if i'll ever change. What is strange is that I am sitting here writing about how I should be working - but no - I'd never actually WORK. Well, I am, but I am taking my sweet time doing it.  And as much as I dont mean it to be conceited - I am lucky I am "gifted", otherwise I'd be an abysmal failure. Luckily I can bluff my way through ;)  How I ever got to this point i'll never know. Back to work for me I think.

      The internet is indeed a strange place. Over the few days I have been diligently avoiding doing any actual work by visiting every link that is sent my inbox. Normally I just skip them, but hey, I am a girl on a mission ;)  First up, this one.  urlLink http://www.31337.pl/ . Its so simple, and yet it articulates what I think at least 15 times a day. I don't usually like elitism - but there are two kinds of people I find insufferable. Stupid people and, worse, Stupid people who try to disguise themselves as intelligent people. Now, that may sound like a horrible thing to say, but hey, further to my rant the other other day about AOL - there really are too many stupid people around with access to a keyboard... then again, many may say the same thing about me so I guess we're even :)  You might think I have a pessimistic view of people. I suppose in many ways I do - John Howard won the last federal election so its not entirely baseless - but I really do like people. Really, I do. Its just my standards are higher than most ;)  I have no idea what I was doing. Oh yes, I was sharing some funny URLs. hmmm What else did I find this week... (hunts through favourites)... (hunts through history because I havent added anything to my favourites)....ah stuffit.  I installed Cool Edit Pro 2 yesterday. It is SO much better than 1.2. Not that I ever use these things - I install them with all the best intentions and then never use them again. I like mucking around with music and I do write some things, but it never gets finished. I don't know if its because of a lack of confidence or a lack of ability (I am guessing its a combination of the two - you can have plenty of confidence and no ability and still be fine *grin*) but I just never finish it. I suppose i am doing the world a favour with that! LOL! Anyway, this post was more to bump the anti-American rant. While I can't bring myself to delete it, seeing as my ascii drawing of the American flag was second to none (heehee), I figured I'd at least stop it from ebing the first thing you read when you enter the blog ;) I was expecting hate mail but got none - even though i've had a fair few visitors (doesn't look like it on thepage though because I had to reset my counter)... its great to se that there are people as devoid of life as I am ;) Who is worse? the person who writes it or the person who actually reads it? :)  Well, thats enough insults from me today. To be honest, I am having troule finding things to rant about. Maybe some of my visitors could email me an article or two to get my back up ;)  In the meantime, have fun eh and i'll write back soon. I think I left a stinky nappy in my daughters room by mistake.... dont worry, it hasnt been there any more than a week (GRIN)

      I spent most of the evening working on my Formula Feeding support site. itmay sound boring to non-mothers, but believe me, is it controversial. I don't know how to be a support group for formula feeding without getting hatemail from the militant breastfeeders - I mean those women are organised! They send out emails to their site members urging them to harass people like me! lol!  I definitely see a need for it. But did you know that you can't even get information about baby formula from the manufacturers? This is how much of a strangehold the breastfeeders have - that us formula feeding mothers can't even access information. I challenge people to find any info on Wyeth's site, Heinz' website, Nestlé, and so on. Geez... So much for freedom of choice - you only have it if you choose the same as they do... its a pain in the arse if you ask me. Why can't you just say "I like this formula." You can't. You have to have a disclaimer "Breast is best...." so that the militants won't come after you. And, even if you have this disclaimer, many still will flame you and have sit-ins on your front lawn! Women victimising and scrutinising other women's decisions is not what I would consider moving towards a better society. it is only when these people learn to lighten up and accept that free-thinking individuals are able to make different decisions to other free thinking individuals - and society can function in spite of it - even BECAUSE of it!  I have no idea how this turned into a rant about breastfeeders... it is late and I should be in bed. Yes. That explains it. I also really needed an excuse to test my right click thingo in my browser that lets me instantaneously update this thing. Its pretty cool :)  Thanks for reading :p

      OK....well this seems to be working now! Its weird how hard it is to write when you feel the pressure! I was browsing the net today and found a couple of sites that might be of interest. The first one is  urlLink www.bushwatch.com  which is dedicated to my favourite world leader (AHEM!) George W. Bush. there is a some great stuff there - Be sure to check out the Bushlexia section! There is also a great feminist magazine called "Bitch" magazine. It ha some insightful commentary - mostly dedicated to feminist responses to popular culture. There are some interesting reads there, anyway. The address is  urlLink www.bitchmagazine.com . What more can I say today? What I am thinking of doing with this is posting articles and then writing my own commentary on it. It might be a news article, a website, or something in the global media. Of course, being hideously lazy on the best of days (not to mention a myriad of assignments that are yet to be written...:)), I may not get here as often as I would like. However, Blogger makes it a little less cumbersome to update, so I may pop in fairly often. We'll see how it goes huh? :)  I suppose I should add a little disclaimer for the rest of my posts. These are my opinions only. While I like to think I am a fairly learned person, and generally do not say things unless there is some basis, I would like to say in advance that I do hold controversial opinions in many areas. There. You were warned. :)  I will not respond to hate mail. There are a few issues that i already know are likely to incite strong reactions in some people, and I will lay them on the table now. I am a social democrat through and through. I am a feminist. I am opposed to the 'War on Terror', even though I have sympathy for the victims of 9/11 (or 11/9 where I come from heh). I formula feed my child. I am not religious and I believe that 'god" has been used far too many times as an excuse for oppression. In other words: Crazy "militant" Americans will not only be ignored, they will be killfiled and reported to their ISP. Same goes for abusive people, militant breastfeeding organisations that suppress choice, fundamentalist ANYTHINGS that preach, whatever. However, if you do email me in a hateful way, be prepared for it to show up here and for me to write a reply.  I am sorry if this appears harsh, but I needed to put this in. I have already received enough loony emails for a lifetime! :)  With all that nasty stuff out of the way, I do, however, welcome polite debate! It is what I do! Even if you hold different/opposing views to my own, I am happy to defend my position in a polite and respectful way. :)  Well... now that the housekeeping is out of the way...lets get on with eh? :)

      Why is it that people only feel good about themselves if they are making another human being feel like a piece of rotten roadkill? I admit it, I do the same thing - sometimes I seem to get great satisfaction out of other people's weaknesses. It is most certainly arrogance and cruelty on my part, fuelled by a hideous lack of true self esteem - I admit it. But its not like everyone else doesn't. The proof of this is in the myriad of gossip magazines, usenet groups, mailing lists, websites, newspapers, and even people idle chatter - that is devoted to celebrity gossip.  We post to gossip channels, read magazines, join email lists devoted to celebrity gossip. We say scathing things, we scrutinise their every move - from outfits to opinions. We blame them for being too skinny, and yet all hell breaks loose when they are too "fat" (obviously a relative term). We praise them for their 'wonderful' bodies, only to find out they are bulimic 6 months down the line. We want to know who the father of Liz Hurley's baby is, but not only that, we accuse her for being some sort of money-grubbing trickster. We mock Britney Spears (I'll get to that later). We speculate on people's marriages, and, the worst part - we believe the outright lies that are presented to us. Celebrity Gossip cuts across class, gender (yes, believe it or not!) and race. Why?  According to most psychologists, humans need to feel good about themselves and their position in society to be productive. And this is where I believe Celebrity Gossip fits in. Celebrities are beautiful. They are wealthy. They can do anything they want, because money and beauty and a lack of 'connections' are not barriers, like they are for most of us. They get to be spokespeople for the United Nations and adopt children from overseas. In other words, they get to do all the wonderful things that all of us would do if we had the same money and profile. How on earth are we supposed to feel good about ourselves while these people exist? I know I don't! In a world that worships beauty over brains, people like me are destined to the middle classes - and the only greatness we can hope to achieve would be if, in 3000 years from now, we are seen as "thinkers". Ha! I suppose if the Google archives count...  So, in comparison to celebrities, we all feel like worthless pieces of crap - cogs in the machine that make other people wealthy. Ben Elton refers to people like us as "farties" - people who aren't beautiful or wealthy. People who have impeccable manners - who you couldn't imagine doing a great big burp whilst sitting down to a microwave dinner. People that take home doggy bags from an expensive restaurant because it costs $120 for a meal and you can't bear to throw it away. People who have a gruesome birth experience and walk around in public with baby vomit on their shirt and are most certainly not beaming with full makeup and a perfect body when their baby is 2 weeks old. I could go on for hours. To us, celebrities represent our dreams, our aspirations and our regrets.They represent everything we wish we were and everything most of us are not - even if we tried our absolute best.  So what we do is we tear them to shreds to make us feel better about ourselves. We would be horrified if our husbands or family said "oi, you're looking a bit fat today" or "good lord...what the fuck are you wearing?". Also, if you were walking up the street and everyone was looking at you and pointing, how would you feel? Thats right, you'd feel terrible. So why is it alright to do this to celebrities? When you post to usenet that scathing message, how do you know that they aren't reading everything you say? And, if you knew they were reading it, would it make you rethink?   Take Britney Spears for instance. Now, those who know me know that I am not a fan. I also don't dislike her at all - call me a casual "hummer" along to her music. My initial reaction to Britney Spears, is that she represents everything that is wrong with the music industry. I am someone with more formal music training and come from old-school that it is your ability to play an instrument or sing perfectly that makes you famous. Naive, I know. But, all the same, I appreciate singer/songwriters, like Lisa Loeb, Ben Folds, etc, where if you strip them down to just them and their instrument in an acoustic show, their prescence still knocks you over. I admit my biases there. And I emulate that music style - fine tuning the acoustic, solo performance so that everything else is just a bonus - it doesnt MAKE the musician - or make the song. So, I lay my biases on the table in that regard. But, Britney, if you ever wanted someone to give you some quality advice about where to go with your career, I'm here! :)  Issues of musical integrity aside (and I like some BS songs....), I think that the personal attacks on her and the scrunity are uncalled for. Comments of late (in various places) have started to become vindictive, callous, and just plain false. I often wonder that if people knew she was hurt by all of this if they would stop saying such horrible things about her. I know I would, because I can't stand the though of my words hurting someone else, even if its a superstar that could buy and sell me on any day of the week! :)  Seriously though, how would we feel if we were put in that position? If I were Britney Spears (heh now THEREs a stretch for  anyones  imagination lol), I would seriously wonder if its all worth it - I mean, she's made enough money to take care of herself and her family for the rest of her life. If she invested a lot of the money into her own label and signed other artists, she could do wonders. I really would be wondering if its all worth it. Here she is, 20 years old, a multi millionaire, with a myriad of options available to her. There would have to come a time when you wonder if its worth it. I personally believe that Britney should learn to play an instrument and try to do it on her "own" if you will. But thats just me :) Little do we realise that eventually someone's got to crack. I know that I could only take so much before I said "fuck it - I'm rich" and disappear out of the public eye.  And little do we realise that this could be happening. Do you REALLY want to be the person whose irascible comments caused someone to quit doing what they love? Because eventually it will happen. Celebrities have internet access too. And I think they read a lot more about themselves than they should. Eventually someone is going to crack. I for one don't want to be one of the people that makes someone feel so awful that they question their whole career.  Maybe you can live with that, but I can't.

      Don't talk to me in the morning. Don't even look at me.  I hate getting up at 6am. I hate the fact that going to bed at 9:30 (which is relatively early for me) and getting up at 6am still only means 8.5 hours sleep. This may seem trivial and self-indulgent (when isn't it?), but bear with me.  I was having a wonderful dream at 6 this morning - it involved all the great elements: Canada, the beach, shopping, Ben Folds, Deborah Mailman and me being 10kg lighter. I don't normally have good dreams, so I was quite perturbed at the incessant HONK HONK HONK that woke me up. And that wasn't my alarm clock. it was Jason telling me he was running late and that he'd be putting Mina in the car. See, I have to drive him to work so I can have the car. And I hate it.  And there is only one thing I hate more than geting up at 6am. It is idle, trivial, chatter when I am still waking up. I got in the car and everything was quiet. I was sitting there with my arms folded and all was well - I'd be awake by the time we got to Jason's work. Look, I love my husband dearly, and we know each well, but he just doesn't seem to get that I don't want to talk to anyone for about half an hour after I wake up. No amount of grunt-answering seems to deter him.  Example. For some reason the radio was tuned to 96fm. I have no idea why people actually tune into this mindless crap - the last thing I want to hear is "alright, call in to us to tell us what you can cook to win tickets to XXX" I'm serious. No mental challenges there, except for the kitchen-illiterate. But sriously, 96% of the population can cook SOMETHING. And 'something' was all we heard. Here's one brilliant response: "uh hi.... I make spaghetti bolognese with chopped up onions, chopped up mushrooms and tomato sauce". My god. How astounding. I always thought that having radio call-ins was a way to engage an aidience to come up with quality entertainment - I normally listen to Triple J and they seem to have it down pretty well. But, my theory is, that anyone who is calling breakfast radio at 6am is a bloody moron to begin with. Firstly, because they are one of those irritating people that "love mornings". Secondly, I don't trust them because they have time to call said stations. Now, when I have to get up for something, chances are I will work out exactly how long I need between waking up and  leaving, and get up at that time. Like this morning for instance. I crawled out of bed, put on my tracky dacks and got in the car. I have a serious mistrust of those that actually have time for anything other than breakfast, showers or driving. Thirdly, the fact that these people brains are working at that time of morning (or clearly arent, seeing that 96fm dialogue) shows that they are clearly aliens and not to be trusted.  Anyway, as if the inane drivel on  the radio wasnt enough - Jason starts talking about Iraq. Now, I consider myself a fairly active person in terms of politics, and I find it hard to turn down a good discussion. In fact, right now "Iraq" is one of my main interests. But it should come as no surprise to you all that, for half an hour a day, I couldn't give a flying fuck about it. All I want to do is go back to bed and dream about Canada and Ben Folds.And, for half an hour a day, I like being able to give the bird to the world without caring. Of course it does wonders for my relationship - you know, being snappy and all that. But I have always been the same so I suppose thats what he deserves for marrying me.  My daughter is the same as me. I think I have the only baby on the planet that quite happily goes to bed at 7:30 and will sleep until 10am given the opportunity. And she looks like me when she wakes up too. It srather funny - and scary - to see a mirror of yourself in the morning. Erm, without looking the mirror. Of course.  So, don't talk to me until 8am. I likely to tell you to go fuck yourself.

      Its been a big week for sports this week. The Superbowl, the Australian Open, the Cricket...the Geelong bay cycling classic. And of course, the FA Cup.  For those who are not aware, soccer riots are not particularly uncommon around the world. We often see it on the news: some club has lost, the fans start a riot, a few people get injured or killed, arrests are made and they move onto the next game, where yet another riot breaks out. It's not something that surprises me much anymore - seeing English soccer fans with all their dutch courage trampling some poor old lady wearing a Manchester scarf. Generally I just scoff and say that it is something that is unique to soccer fans. "It's like religion, it's  weeird " I say to myself.   Yesterday's Superbowl also induced riots when Oakland Raiders fans lost the game. They set fire to cars and a McDonald's restaurant because they were drunk and noone would serve them. Ok, I made that bit up. But they did actually set fire to the place. What is interesting here, however, is that the Raiders' fans also rioted when they *won* the week before! It's rather funny when you think about it, but it also makes me wonder if people, firstly, use sport as an excuse to be utter melonheads, or whether they are so blinded by faith for their teams that they *honestly* believe that supporters of the opposing team are an "enemy". As someone who defines my interest in sport as 'passing', and my knowledge of sporting events being limited to the 10 minutes on Chennel Ten news every night, it's something I simply cannot comprehend. Or can I?  Perhaps it gives us more insight into nationalism and how it can skew our perspective. "Nation" as a concept is something that is unclear in its meaning. It is not simply a matter of drawing a line on a map and calling it a nation - it is far more complex than that. It is both objective and subjective. In a formal sense, it is a cultural entity: people who speak the same language, have the same religion, have a shared history, and so on. However, it is commonly accepted that a nation, or a community, can also be defined subjectively by its members, and could be distinguished by a shared loyalty or affection in the form of patriotism. Why doesn't this apply to soccer teams? Or Raiders fans? Or the Lisa Loeb Fan Forum?  As I type, American, UK and Australian troops are headed for the gulf to fight a war that about 60% (and rising) of their people disagree with. There was an article in  the West Australian  a couple of days ago that says that 65% of people have no faith in their politicians with regard to environmental issues, and this is a common trend across the western world. Our governments are simply not listening to their people. Most of us just want good quality healthcare and education for our children, and reliable roads and a government that takes care of those unable to take care of themselves. And we simply aren't getting it. America spends hundreds of millions of dollars on the military, Australia has increased its funding in defence. And noone wants it. People's faith in their government is dwindling and they are feeling increasingly helpless as we are led into World War 3 by a maniac with a vendetta and a lust for crude.  Now you may wonder why this is related to soccer riots and the riots that took place at the Superbowl. Well, it occured to me the other day, as I heard the news about the Superbowl riot, that people have nothing to fight for anymore because their governments just won't listen. They have noone to believe in, noone to identify with and bind them as a nation. Our politicians are corrupt, our priests abuse their power. The rich are getting richer at the expense of the poor, and the poor are marginalised for objecting under the guise of "free enterprise". So instead, we turn to that last place where equality is not a dirty word: Sports. The one place where the "level playing field" is exactly that, and not another government buzzword to dupe the poor out of medicine. Where flags once flew there are now team scarves and hats. And where national anthems once rang, there are team songs. Where there were inspirational political speeches about how our world *should be*, there are backflips and bum patts over a goal.  Now, don't get me wrong. I am not at all trying to justify the behaviour of those hooligans that go and beat up other fans. If anything, it gives us some insight into the ugly side of human nature: that instead of enjoying a game together in an environment of equality and respect, they'll attempt to beat up the enemy, all the while disrespecting other people's environment and property to prove their point. Just like the Americans are quite prepared to create war, to the detriment of our environment and our people, to prove the point that they are the "biggest" in the world.  However, in the end, is it  really  worth it? At the end of the day all you have is a burnt car and a burnt McDonalds restaurant. And a few people dead. But it never actually solves the issue, does it?

      It has been a while since I posted anything here, but I will try to post more from now on.  There have been a few reasons why I wasn't as enthusiastic about keeping this blog going. The main one was simply that I was too afraid to write! That may sound silly, but I will give you a little back story.  I am a member of a Yahoo Group called "September2001Babies". Don't ask me why, but I joined it when I first found out I was pregnant with Mina and I made some good friends, so I stayed. Anyway, The list was predominantly American. When I say "predominantly", I mean that there were probably 3 members out of 90 that were outside of the United States, with one Canadian, one from Australia (ie me) and one from Finland (I think it was - one of those Nordic ones anyway). Anyway, most Australians and Canadians, and even a few Americans, look at things differently to the dominant conservative culture that exists, and even have a different sense of humour from the dominant culture that is White America. Me being the type of person that I am, I questioned the Americans more than I should, and probably challenged them more often than they would have liked me too. Most of the time they spent their time arguing about how not to upset each other with subject headers whilst upsetting people...go figure... until my Canadian friend posted pictures of her Halloween carvings of Bush and Osama Bin laden to the list. Well, needless to say,  the irony was not noted and it sparked a mass exodus from the list - of all the US "Moms" away from me and my Canadian friend. A few decent folks stayed, but the list basically died at the hands of one or two people who couldn't take a joke. This isn't the full story - there were a few other troublemakers and "discussions" that would usually end in me calling them all "retarded" or something, but fundamentally, I was consistently bullied for my opinions for nearly two years before the wenches left the group. Basically it ended in me believing that Americans live in a freaky  Sliders  episode and I was too scared to post anything controversial or even honest for fear of losing the few members that stuck around on the babies list. This wasn't a direct cause, but it was one of the reasons I became too afraid to post anything about what I was thinking for fear of being harassed again. In other words, I started to conform.  Fast forward to yesterday.  I saw Michael Moore's "Bowling for Columbine" and I had one of those rare moments where it felt really good to be "me". For months I have felt marginalised. In fact, I have felt marginalised for practically my whole life, having always been isolated or harassed for being "gifted" (whatever the heck that means). But these last few months, I have felt particularly isolated and down, because no matter where I turned - the mainstream media, my family, that email list that I talked about, even people at uni - there was this air of not only hatred and racism, but support for war, support for American dominant culture, and propaganda against Muslim communities around the world. I have also been confused about what I am supposed to do with my life, how I can use my diverse talents and interests to make a difference. And, not only that, I have been frustrated that noone would listen to me when I expressed an opinion that was different to the norm. So I just stopped. I stopped debating with my grandmother when she talked about "those Muslims". I stopped writing my blog and writing my book, and just writing in general. I stopped caring about me degree and worried more about finishing than learning. I stopped writing because, without my strong convictions and my strong sense of irony and humour, I had nothing to write about. I was so afraid of saying the wrong thing that my 'craft' was suffering, and I was becoming everything I despised: Someone who censors themselves for the sake of appearances. I was becoming mainstream.  And then I watched Bowling for Columbine (www.michaelmoore.com). I watched Michael Moore making a difference - rubbing against the grain of American mainstream politics. And taking galant risks for what he believes in, through his craft of comedy and filmmaking. I watched him challenge Charlton Heston in his own home and present the facts about American Imperialism. I watched him take 2 teenage boys that had bullets lodged in their bodies after the Columbine shootings to Kmart. I watched as he used his profile and convictions to cause Kmart to phase out the sale of handgun and semi-automatic ammunition. And not only did I feel inspired, I felt vindicated.  And I had an epiphony. I realised that it is a GOOD thing that I am different to all those women on my list. I am not someone prepared to settle for a house in a gated community to convince myself that life is strawberries and cream, and that blacks are a threat and everyone outside the US is out to get you. I am not prepared to sacrifice my convictions for fear of what some brainwashed, Oprah-watching housewives are going to say, because I *am* better than them. They will hate me for saying it, but I am, because instead of spending my days playing peekaboo and doing laundry, I have decided to make a difference in this world through my writing. And anyone who attempt to scare me into submission will not succeed anymore, because I am a different person. I have realised that it takes strength to have opinions and it takes courage to express those opinions in face of opposition. I also realised that its okay to be myself, and being armed with education and writing ability puts me in a position of power in this world.  Now, while this may only be a weblog amongst millions, I have realised that there is a reason I was put on this earth - and that is to use my writing in the same way that Michael Moore has used filmmaking. It may sound arrogant, but I really don't care. Consider this a mission statement for the blog entries to come. I will be writing my book again; I will be writing newspaper articles and columns. And I will make a difference through my art.  I promise I won't make too many self-indulgent, Oprah-magazine editorials from now on. but I did need to explain why I disappeared. I look forward to feedback from people. Thanks for reading.

      As you all may have noticed, I haven't written here for some time. It wasn't because I didn't have anything to write about, but because there has just been so much, and I am just *so* lazy :). Where on earth do I begin? In January, the last time I posted here, the world was only talking about bombing Iraq to smitherines; now they are "liberated". In January the infamous Bashir interviews with Michael Jackson were only talked about and not seen; now, we are aware of what an absolute freak he is - and how thin a line there is between a documentary and tabloid journalism. In January 70% of people in Australia and in America opposed war on Iraq; now public opposition is less than half of that. Oh, and of course, "freedom" fries are the new side dish at McDonald's. Try swallowing those without gagging!  So, with such huge issues unfolding before our very eyes, where can I begin? What can I write about? All of these issues are rant-worthy in their own right. However, as unrelated as Michael Jackson may appear to be to the war on Iraq, there are elements that are eerily similar. And no, its not about both Saddam and Michael being weird recluses or even a joke about Michael Jackson hiring Muhammed Saeed al-Sahaf (the Iraqi Intelligence Minister) as his publicist, its about our obsession with entertainment: our ability, through the media, and as a society, to detach ourselves from tragedy and turn it into entertainment.  Watching Michael Jackson's interview gave me an uneasy feeling, and yet I couldn't put my finger on it at the time. At first I thought it was because I felt undecided about his "involvement" with children (and I am not prepared to speculate, as far as I am concerned he has not been found guilty by a jury) - or that I felt he was just such a sad, tragic figure that it broke my heart. But I realised that it wasn't any of that. It was the fact that this man had been propped up as entertainment for the millions of people that watched, even though he is clearly in need of help (what sort, I don't know, but I believe he's mentally ill). The spectacle that was made of his life and his problems, through this documentary, did what the media does best. It detached us from the very real tragedy of Michael Jackson's life. An arguably brilliant man who has been destroyed by his family and by the media. And what did people talk about after the interview aired? Not whether it was moral to interview him in the first place, nor whether it was responsible to portray Michael that way (in my opinion, 'trial by media' should be a crime). They talked about - you guessed it - whether he raped some kid with cancer. Its this obsession with gossip and innuendo, and of course, celebrity, that desensitises us from the issues we should be thinking about. The issues that really should matter, such as media morality, or the concept of "celebrity".  I don't think I will ever forget how I felt the morning (Australian time) that the first bombs were dropped on Baghdad. All of our television networks (with the exception of the ABC) brought live footage, uttering buzzwords such as "shock and awe", "dazzling display", and "light show over Baghdad" - like it was some sort of pretty fireworks display for all the loyal viewers. The 24 hour coverage, complete with sexy footage and advertising revenue, reiterated and repeated the same information over again. It had a two-tiered effect: Firstly, it perpetuated that culture of fear that has dominated America for the better part of this century, and secondly, it reduced the war into yet another ratings bonanza. For those that supported the war it was great seeing the "fireworks" around Baghdad, and journalists reporting with gasmasks, struggling to breathe. It was, first and foremost, quality entertainment. People were being fed simplistic ideas in a simple way - and we wonder why they now support the war? Of course, because we don't get to see the hundreds (possibly thousands) of Iraqi women's bodies, impaled, limbless, clutching the corpses of their newborn babies. We don't see Iraqi children who are in hospital with shrapnel wounds. No, that would be too confronting for prime time. But that, my friends, is the reality of war. The reality that we are not seeing, because we only see what "they" want us to see. They want us to see advertising. They want us to keep consuming. They don't want us to see the gritty reality of war, nor do they want to see real debate about the legality or the moral justification for it. So they trivialise it. Make it pretty. Make it seem like a distant problem, that is only happening to "them" in Iraq. Well, unfortunately, the more we detach ourselves from tragedy, the more we create a real problem in our society, because we allow our leaders to get away with brainwashing, greed and corruption.  And then, instead of actually debating the issues, we do idiotic things like renaming French Fries to "Freedom Fries". They've really done their job well when you think about it.

      The Matrix versus the real world and soggy sandwiches..    Golly gosh, where do I begin? I haven't written here for what - 2 months now? Despite my grand promises of updating every week, life inevitably gets in the way. And, whenever I do go to update, my Blog ideas end up being out of date.     Let me fill you all in on the brilliant ideas I have had for Blogs in the last few months. There was that brilliant piece I had mapped out in my head that was meant to coincide with the release of Matrix: Reloaded, intertwining global media corporations and Matrix philosophy. Then there was the brilliant piece about Michael Jackson, and that bit about why I actively avoid Harry Potter and want to strangle Avril Lavigne, or... ok, I think you get the point. I had a lot of really good Blog ideas and I never wrote any of them.     Why? You ask? Well, For the first time ever, Téa has ventured into the big wide world of the 9-5. The hustle and bustle of peak hour traffic and the smell of soggy homemade lunches. That's right - I got myself a job.     For years, people have been telling me that I should join the real world, and escape the insular, protective shell of University life. Why they thought I wasn't in the real world is beyond me - I think that cleaning grease-catches and making souvlaki for intoxicated accountants for $4 an hour is about as real-world as you can get. I suppose its more a strategy for fobbing off intelligent conversation. But anyway. I have, for all intents and purposes, joined the "real world", where people don't have time to write humourous (apparently) columns, troll usenet or talk about insignificant crap with American feral mothers. I have entered a world where no matter how creative, no matter how brilliant, or no matter how committed we are to surfing for porn, we all do the same thing: flop on the couch at 6pm and go to sleep by 9:30.    That's right. I have been eaten by the work monster. That beast that usurps all my creative energy, and lets my hard earned finger callouses from years of guitar playing go soft. It makes my webpage feel neglected and my Yahoo! groups have a gaping great hole where there was once insignificant diatribe. It leaves my IM windows unanswered, my phone messages ignored, and that 20 pages of the novel I started go unwritten. I used to iron clothes once every 2 weeks or so. Now I iron every day. And I wear stockings. I hate stockings. I always said that there was one way to know you were officially a grownup - and that is that you wear stockings more than once a month.    You may be thinking right about now "gawd, you'd think she was the only person to ever start working full time!" Don't get me wrong, as far as jobs go, I have a good one, but sometimes I don't feel there is a lot of scope for Uni graduates in particular to be able to adjust. When you are someone like me who is particularly creative, and actually has physical withdrawals when I am not writing, or drawing, or playing music, it is a major culture shock going from University to full time work. First of all, University was invented so that people could sit around, smoke pot and think about life. It allows self-expression, creativity, and exploration of all things magical in this world, like philosophy, art, and popular culture (It also enables a lot of TV viewing, such as Springer, Bold and the Beautiful and Passions, but that is another story altogether!). Secondly, there is all this free time. Sure, you'd need to get up for that "early" lecture at 9am once a week, but for the most part, Uni work was on your own terms and to your own schedule. Then, the unwitting graduate walks into a job where there is structure and process and post it notes and a computer that actually uses the Calendar and Tasks in Outlook. And suddenly 11 hours a day is gone. And then whammo - all of a sudden you are consumed by paper and phone calls and process and paper - and before you know it, you have neglected your web pages, your music and your writing, and bit by bit you lose a little piece of yourself that you'll never get back.    Maybe I was just never really cut out for the 9-5 in a strict sense. I don't have patience for detail, and worst of all, I really get stifled and bored very quickly if I am not creatively stimulated (shaddup dirty minded people). I have been seriously contemplating the idea of doing a Dip Ed in 2004, then heading out to a country school to teach in 2005. I suppose everyone idealises certain career paths, but my whole life I have been drawn to teaching. And especially being in an office environment (even though that particular environment is fantastic), I don't know if I am really cut out for it. I need to be constantly challenged, moved and entertained - and I have a strong desire to make a difference in people's lives. And, I don't have to wear stockings.    Maybe I just belong in an education environment for the rest of my life. I am so happy when I am teaching others or learning that I suppose its the natural choice. But then that would mean I'd need to escape the "real world".    Is that such a bad thing? After all, 99.9% of people in the Matrix live in blissful ignorance.The Matrix Versus The Real World and Soggy Sandwiches...

      I am sorry I haven't updated much (yet again), but I have been busy with uni work.  However, I promise better quality posting from here on in. As you can see, I have implemented a book reviews page - to share some of my favourite books with you.  I am putting an Amazon link up here, just to see if I can get any help funding my book addiction. If you're interested in buying the book, by all means feel free to buy them using my affiliate number: All it does is give me some sort of discount on the books I buy all the time from Amazon. So any help would be great.  That's not me trying to make money off my site at all - I just figured that if I was going to link to Amazon I might as well get those gift vouchers ;)  The first book is "Fast Food Nation" by Eric Schlosser. I wont be cross-promoting my areas at all - this is the last time :)  So, even if you don't see a lot of updates from me in the blog department - I do try my best - but, unfortunately when your 3000 word essay on Elite theory in Australia beckons, it is hard to find an excuse to update when ...well...you know how it is.  Anyway, I hope that there are still people visiting this site. lol.

      Well, today marks the second anniversary of the September 11th attacks. I bet you weren't aware of that, seeing as the media so often underplays that footage...and there is practically no commemorative spam...lol.  I just got a CNN Breaking News message that says "[the] State Department warns of "increased indications" that al Qaeda is preparing attacks on U.S. interests to coincide with 9/11 anniversary." What the hell does "increased indications" mean? How much longer is the government going to keep Americans in a state of fear?  Excuse me if I rant a little bit, but it is fear of EVERYTHING that makes yanks so utterly irrational. They are afraid of everything that might happen - and nothing that *does* happen.  For example, did you know that 38% of children in America, or 27 million kids, live in a low income family? Of those, over 12 million live in poverty, and over 5 million live in extreme poverty. That's more alarming than 'increased indications' of an al Qaeda attack.  Did you know that heart disease is America's biggest killer? Did you know that lung cancer is the second? And did you know that the number one disease affecting children is asthma? Did you know that there is a causal link between air pollution and all of these chronic diseases? And did you know that Bush and Cheney have an interest in companies that are responsible for massive amounts of pollution?  Oil companies are the largest industrial source of volatile organic compounds (which lead to ozone smog), the second largest industrial source of sulfur dioxide (which is transformed into dangerous fine particles and acid rain) and the third largest industrial source of nitrogen oxides (another smog- forming pollutant). Oil refineries also emit large amounts of toxic air pollutants -- more than 58 million pounds in 1997.  Healthcare funding has been cut, which makes things even worse for those who suffer illnesses as a result of pollution. Why aren't people angry or scared about this?  Military spending is at an all time high. It has been legitimised by the periodic releases of terror alerts, each getting more and more vague. Keep them scared...keep them frightened about things that will be unlikely to affect them...so that they don't have time to think about the things that do.  "Increased indications" of a terrorist attack. Just look at that phrase. That's the BEST they can do. Coincidentally, it came out just as people were starting to doubt the success of the war on Iraq. Just as Bush' popularity is declining. Just as domestic issues, like the environment and health care, are slowly making their way back onto the agenda...what happens? The anniversary of September 11. That hotbed of grief, injustice and terror that is still fresh in most people's minds.  But, we need to put it in perspective. It happened. It was horrible. And it does represent people's worst fears. However, it gets to the point where the government starts to use it as a tool to manipulate the public. They manipulate the grief, anxiety and shock to further their own morally corrupt agendas. And, worse than that, to criticise them means that you are un-American, or anti-American (as I have been called a fair few times *g*).  I am not saying 'get over it' to Americans. But I am saying that you shouldn't let a group of corrupt, wealthy, and very greedy men use the memory to manipulate public opinion and further their own agendas.  Start holding them accountable. Demand quality healthcare. Demand clean air. Sure, there is a slightly increased risk of a terrorist attack, and yes, someone might kill you. That is, if the air you breathe doesn't kill you first.  We need to get our fears into perspective. We need to realise that being hit by a bus is more likely than being on a bus with a suicide bomber. And that you are more likely to die from the"food" you ingest than from anthrax.  And most of all, you need to get that oaf out of power before we're all wiped off the face of the earth

      I don't know if any of you have been following the debate lately about higher education reform, but it is an issue that I am particularly interested in. For the un-initiated, the main reforms involve allowing school leavers who do not get the marks to enter University to pay their way into a course. I am interested in this issue not only as someone who has benefited from accessible education, but I am also opposed to the reforms because it is unfair. Plain and simple. Let me tell you why.  The higher education system in America is a two tiered system, similar to the one proposed by the Liberal government. Wealthy children with not-so-great marks get into Harvard, Princeton, etc, and the rest either struggle their way through the tens of thousands of dollars in tuition fees, or take athletic scholarships to subsidise their education. Then, you have the countless young people who try to get an education by joining the military, like that poor, poor "Shock and Awe" poster-girl, Jessica Lynch.  Like many other young working class (and increasingly, middle class) Americans, Jessica Lynch joined the military because she wanted a college degree, so that she could eventually become a teacher. Now, whether you agree with war or not, whether you believe the exaggerated stories of her 'rescue' or not, or even whether you agree with military service for our young or not - one thing remains abundantly clear. There are kids in America that are prepared to risk permanent disfigurement and even death so that they can receive an education. Surely, that can't be right. Surely, if you want an education in America you can have one? Right? Right...?  Now, let us take a look at the person that sent Jessica Lynch and thousands of other teenagers to the war in Iraq. The walking answer to the question "what is wrong with the United States?" - George W. Bush.  Did you know that George Junior has a degree in History from Yale? Did you know that he also holds an MBA from Harvard Business School? Pretty amazing feats for a man that referred to the "Chinesians". I guess I am amazed, primarily because I always thought that Universities like Harvard and Yale had some degree of academic integrity - where it most certainly helped to be rich, but it wasn't the overriding factor in admissions.  I always thought that Harvard required a particularly high standard for entry, including a resume of real world experience, a strong grade-point average, and a 'reputable' degree.   But, alas, I have been proven wrong, because it seems that baby George didn't need it because 1) his daddy was Chairman of the Republican National Committee and 2) They had shit loads of money. Sure, he had a degree from a reputable University...but honestly, do we *really* believe he has studied History? Maybe he's confusing an American History unit for a History degree... alas...back to my point.  We don't know Jessica Lynch's academic history - for all we know she could have been a bare-pass student. She could also be very bright. However, even if she is only average, what differentiates one bear-pass student like Lynch, from another like George W Bush?   The Moula.  And its wrong.  There is something inherently unfair about a stupid man with a lot of money, coasting his way through life, having access to all the "best" schools, and others who are not necessarily outstanding, but also not rich, being sent off to war so that they can receive an education.  And this, my friends, brings to my point about user-pays in higher education reforms in Australia. If you allow universities to charge upfront fees to people who cannot get in on their own merits, you take one step closer towards a two-tiered education system. On one hand, you have students who work hard to get a 65%+ average to get into University. They will graduate with massive amounts of debt and get squeezed out of the more expensive courses, and as a result, will never escape the working class trap. Then, you'll have kids who have never worked an honest day in their lives - coasting into an LLB with a 60% average and a fistful of dollars, who will graduate into easy jobs with friends-of-friends, and maintain their hold on society by forming the elite.  And then, before you know it, we'll no longer be saying "don't let it go the way of America", because by then we'll already be there. And by then, we'll be sending our working class kids to fight in wars, getting themselves maimed and killed in order to get an education.  Higher education "reform" is nothing but another attempt by John Howard to turn us into the 51st state of America. Its times like this I feel an awful lot like a Canadian.

      First off, I would like to wish everyone a Happy and Prosperous 2004. I, for one, hope to have a better year than I did last year: I guess that's really all we can hope for. Not dying and maybe trying to improve our lives a little bit from year to year. Not that I am really keen on the whole resolution thing, but still...  It's been an eventful few weeks, what with earthquakes all over the place, Michael Jackson's arrest, and Steve Irwin being investigated for mistaking his newborn son for crocodile bait. But instead, me being the narcissist that I am, I am going to talk about myself.  I learned a lot in 2003. I could focus on your typical Oprah-remembering-your-spirit crap, or I could talk about the things that I was rather surprised to learn about in 2003. You see, despite being fairly widely read, and despite being a moderately intelligent human being, there are a few things that I have naively taken for granted. You know, the silly, trivial things that you have never really questioned until you are surprised to learn how stupid you actually are. Here goes.  1. "Grease" has a lot of sexual references.  I had no idea.  I must've seen that movie about 40 times throughout my childhood: I knew the movie off by heart, I sang with it, dreamed I was Olivia Newton John singing "Hopelessly Devoted to You" whilst kneeling in the front yard (The neighbors thought I was a very strange kid).  Then I watched it not so long ago and heard words that I had never known about. All of a sudden Rizzo was talking about gang bangs and all other sorts of stuff that I had no idea about! I was horrified!  2. There is no such thing as an anti-gravity chamber.  Ok, I am sure the nerd-boys that love physics will snigger at me and say "what an idiot", but I really thought that there was some such thing as an anti-gravity chmber where you could just go and float around. Apparently they don't exist. Apparently there's something called gravitational pull on earth and you can't get around it.  3. Stealth bombers do not have special invisible paint.   My husband was quick to point out this one to me. I thought that the diamond-type design was there to make it look cool and futuristic, and the steathy-ness was made by special paint that was undetectable by radar. Okay, so maybe I deserve to be laughed out of the room for that one, but hey, unless you have sought out the information, how are you supposed to know? The only reason it came up was because of some documentary on the stealth bomber came on the Discovery Channel. Until then my husband thought he was married to someone with a brain. Boy, was he wrong.  4. Pencils are not made by drilling a hole down the middle.  I learned this from Play School of all places (a kids show, aimed at 3-5 year olds), where they went to a pencil factory. I always thought that pencils were made from really good quality sticks, and you just drilled a hole down the middle and put the leads in that way. Apparently that is *not* how it is done. Maybe if I had been allowed to watch television as a kid I might know this!  So, there you have it. Four things that I have learned in 2003. Who knows, maybe in 2004 I'll learn that my favourite childhood singer is a paedophile.  The thing about the New Year is not to make grand resolutions about changing your life. You can only do that if you are truly committed to it for the long term. But you can look back at the previous year and realise that at least you're just that little bit less stupid than you used to be

      Not sure if anyone is interested in reading this, but I thought I would share an essay I wrote on Elite theory. It still needs some work (I got a bit lazy around the ending), but it might provoke someone's interest :)  --  It has been said that pluralism is one of the main characteristics of a thriving liberal democracy, and it has been long accepted that Australia is, indeed, a pluralist democracy (Henderson, 1990, p.201). A manifestation of a truly pluralist democracy is the existence of interest groups that compete for government attention, and actively try to influence government policy.  Pluralism refers to a form of democracy that operates through the capacity of organised groups and interests to articulate popular demands and ensure government responsiveness. (Heywood, 1997, p.77) This has been a long-held ideal for Australia: the notion of a fair go that manifests in all interest groups having a chance to influence government - irrespective of wealth, size or the political status of those being represented. However, there has also been significant criticism of this opinion, arguing that despite the ideals of pluralism, Australia more closely fits the elitist model  in that some groups are the most influential in the Australian system (Henderson, 1990, p.201). Elite theory is defined in many different ways, depending on whether it has been seen as desirable, undesirable or simply as inevitability (Heywood, 1997, p.78). Modern elite theory, however, has been generally associated with American thinkers such as C. Wright Mills and Thomas Dye. It refers to a minority in whose hands power, wealth or privilege is concentrated. In other words, a highly-concentrated number of elites control most of the wealth, most of the power and most of the privilege in society  and use this wealth, power and privilege to influence the decisions of government.   According to C. Wright Mills, the elite in America consists of three areas: the highest political leaders including the president and a handful of key cabinet members and close advisers; major corporate owners and directors; and high-ranking military officers (Mills, 1956). The media can also considered to be a recent addition to the elites. The criteria for being considered part of the elite depends on a number of factors: wealth (for example corporations), the number of people they represent (in the case of churches) or status (as in the military, or the media). These factors tend to overlap, for example, churches are wealthy, represent a large number of people but also have significant status as moral leaders; the media are also wealthy, represent a large number of people, and hold significant status in society.  Government (at least, members who are not part of cabinet) is generally not considered a part of the elite, but merely a mechanism for the elite to exercise its collective interests, in this case, through interest groups. Of course, there has been much debate as to whether the elite do actually have a collective interest; however, for the purposes of this essay it is assumed that the wealthy would like to stay wealthy, and that the powerful would like to stay powerful, and with that comes a collective set of goals  including deregulation, lower taxes, maintenance of the status-quo, and other policies that directly benefit the elite class.  How does this apply to interest groups and their influence? Davis, Wanna, Warhurst and Weller (1993, p.27) state that access to government [by interest groups] is unequal. Some groups are so close to government that they can be regarded as insiders. The question to ask is whether the same interest groups that form the elite (those with the most money, size and status in society), are the same groups that form the inner circle of government influence. A secondary question would be: are we a pluralist or an elitist democracy? The answer is money, size and status do impact on a groups ability to influence government, and particularly to enter that inner circle of insiders.   However, the Australian system is not entirely elitist. Our decentralised, federal system of government serves smaller interest groups that do not have a lot of money, size, or status, because senators, state governments and local councils are still able to effect change, and are generally more accessible than federal cabinet members. Most of this essay focuses on federal government policy decisions, however, this can equally apply to state governments (particularly Premiers and cabinet members).   Money   The amount of resources an interest group has access to has a significant impact on their ability to effectively lobby governments. According to Davis et al (1993, p.148):  making representationsis an expensive business. It requires expertise in the field and an understanding of the governments policy options. It also requires a knowledge of the structure and processes of government so that leverage may be applied in the appropriate place and at the appropriate time.  This means that in order to effectively lobby the federal government, interest groups need to have access to a high level of expertise in order to get their concerns heard. Further, this requires the interest groups to hire high-level staff, or to utilise an independent, professional lobbyist. Along with the structural expenses of maintaining an organisation, such as offices, staff and computers, marketing and advertising campaigns can run into millions of dollars.   Of course, there are cheaper alternatives to mass media campaigns and professional lobbyists. According to Davis et al (1993, p.154), organising a protest is the traditional technique for demonstrating support. However, these are only most effective when they represent a significant proportion of the population. We need look no further than the anti-war protests this year, which had numbers in the tens of thousands in each capital city. This is an example of a well organised campaign that represented the opinions of a significant number of Australians. However, according to Davis et al (1992, p.155), there are many groups that cannot organise in sufficient numbers to get support, such as the unemployed, Aborigines, the homeless and the poor, because they represent a minority opinion.  So, those groups that represent a sectional interest or minority opinion often have no choice but to organise a formal interest group, to lobby government and attempt to change government policy. Alternatively, they can try to change public opinion through media campaigns and advertising. Both of these options are expensive.   Another option for interest groups is to contribute to election campaigns of parties that support their aims. For example, tobacco companies have a long history of making donations to both the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party in order to influence their policy-making decisions. A leaked Philip Morris Corporate Affairs Plan revealed that at least one tobacco company set aside $100,000 a month to target politicians in Australia. (Action on Smoking and Health Australia, 2001). According to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald (Seccombe, 2003), Australian political parties received donations of $142 million in the 2001-2002 financial year. In June 2001, the NSW Liberal Partys fundraiser, Michael Yabsley, admitted collecting $3.5 million in 16 months from major corporations, using a Liberal party fundraising organisation called Millennium Forum  that not only does not need to disclose donations, but offers an opportunity to talk directly with the Prime Minister after a donation is made (Browning, 2001).   Some organisations have much greater access to senior bureaucracy and government than others (Davis et al, 1993, p.150). A study of advisory committees for the Royal Commission on Commonwealth Government Administration (1976, cited in Davis et al, p.150) stated that more than four-fifths of all groups represented on advisory committees were producer groups: and of these almost half were business associations. Even though business does not speak with one voice to government and there are several different groups with different aims and influence (Beresford, 2000, p. 121), some groups wield significant influence over government. The Business Council of Australia (BCA) has an operating budget of over $5 million and a staff of 16, many of whom are former senior government officials. (Beresford, 2000, p.121). However, it does not end there. According to Singleton (Cited in Beresford, 2000, p.121-122), many influential business organisations were selected to sit on various committees and forums, and were represented by government departments. In the Kennett Victorian government, there have been links between the awarding of un-tendered contracts and Liberal Party donations (Steketee 1995, p.9).  How do those interest groups that represent the poorer members of our society fare against the interests of the elites? The relationship between governments and these sorts of groups is generally volatile and dependent on the groups position on any given issue. For example, despite the ACTU being considered an insider under the Hawke and Keating governments, after the election of John Howard, the ACTU became marginalised and undermined (Beresford, 2000, p.123). The same has been said about ACOSS, the peak organisation representing approximately 250 community welfare associations. According to Beresford (2000, p.124), ACOSS was drawn into the policy-making process, but the relationship was not always an easy onedue to the differences it had with the Hawke/Keating governments Despite Gruen and Gratten (1993, cited in Beresford, 2000, p.124)) considering the relationship productive as a whole, it does show the difficulties that can be faced with organisations that represent interests that are not in tune with business. In contrast to business-related interest groups, that generally transcend governmental change (Beresford, 2000, p.123), interest groups that lack economic clout seem to be insiders only at the discretion of the government.  This implies that business groups do use their economic clout to influence government  by threatening job losses, or through more covert measures like party donations. This is consistent with Elite theory: the corporations that form the elite use their money to persuade governments. The evidence also suggests that interest groups with less money, and those that do not make generous donations to political parties, tend to get fewer opportunities to impact on public policy.    Size   Interest groups often claim to represent a silent majority, or to represent a significant proportion of the population. It generally goes without saying that government is more likely to pay attention to a group that represents 50% of the population over one that represents 2 or 3% - because to lose even half of those 50% of voters can be disastrous for any government. It is no coincidence, therefore, that the majority of insider groups are large, national organisations. Davis et al (1993, p.142) state that national representation has become the key to participate in tripartite agreements and to having a voice in Canberra. Because of this, smaller interest groups often merge with other groups with similar aims, in order to better represent their interests to government. For example, ACOSS represents over 2500 community welfare organisations (Beresford 124), and ACTU represents the majority of trade unions at the federal level.  With greater size also comes more access to money and resources (Davis et al, 1993, p.143), including the ability to hire professional lobbyists, and the ability to make donations to political parties, and the ability to fund media campaigns. The ACTU, officially representing 12% of the workforce in 2002, have been influential purely because of their ability to utilise their numbers. The ACTU was central in the formulation of the Accord in the 1980s (Smith, 2000, p. 287). The sheer size and influence of the unions over ALP policy (they have a 60:40 ratio at the National Conference), meant that the ACTU had remarkable sway in areas like industrial relations and income policy.   The size of an interest group and the amount of money it has are, for the most part, interrelated. Massive corporations like Kerry Packers PBL and Rubert Murdochs Newscorp, are both incredibly wealthy and own a significant amount of property and businesses. Not only that, they can also wield tremendous influence over the electorate (Smith, 2000, p.333). The Catholic and Anglican churches own billions of dollars in assets, and together represent 45.9% of the population (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2001). These organisations can also have a tremendous influence over the population, because of their high moral status. Both of these very large interest groups have significant influence of the government, and can most certainly be considered insiders.  For an interest group that is not wealthy but large, however, there seems to be less of a tendency for them to be able to influence public policy. ACOSS, for example, represent the poorest people in the country, despite representing a large number of organisations. Similarly, Veterans organisations, consumer groups and Aged Care organisations represent significant numbers of people that are underrepresented in Australian Politics. In a study of federal Department of Health advisory committees (Australian Consumers Association et al, cited in Davis et al, 1993, p.150), professional organisations had about 220 representatives on 65 different committees, [yet] consumer or community organisations only had 30 representatives on 23 different committees.  Does size in itself improve an interest groups ability to influence government? The evidence seems to show that, even though groups that are nationally organised and represent larger groups have a better chance at influencing government policy, it is only those groups with money as well as size that form the group of insiders in government policy. Even the biggest interest groups that represent poorer citizens are usually outsiders.  This is consistent with Elite theory in that there is a select group of large, wealthy organisations that are getting greater access to government, and, in turn having greater influence over government decisions. The key point in Elite theory, particularly when it comes to interest groups, is that money, size and status on their own do not mean that a group will be considered insiders. It is often those groups that have wealth, size and status together that form that inner circle.   Status   An important factor that determines how much government attention a group receives is the status of its members. Status can be social, economic or political, and refers to the level of societal status the group represents. For example, doctors, lawyers and even teachers are considered to have a high level of social status, and this manifests in how the government responds to their requests. The Australian Medical Association, for example, is one of the more visible professional associations, and its position as an insider has generally transcended governmental change. According to Beresford (2001, p.124), the AMA has a multi-million dollar budget and is actively involved in liaison with government through membership of official advisory councils. They are usually the first group approached with regard to health policy changes, and a stamp-of-approval from the AMA is highly sought after by the political parties. Upon her appointment to the Health Ministry, Kay Patterson made it a priority to forge a close working relationship with the AMA (Fonesca, 2001). During the 2001 election, the AMA actively campaigned on a single issue:   On health, AMA president Dr Kerryn Phelps has already begun tours of marginal seats, and will campaign for more funds for public hospitals, more aged care places, indigenous health, and higher Medicare rebates for doctors. The AMA will announce its preferred health policy after both parties release costed policies.  (Kingston, 2001)  Another interest group with a very high level of social status is the churches, and more specifically, Christian churches. In the Australian Bureau of Statistic Census data for 2001, 68% of people answered that they were of the Christian faith, with 45.9% of those being Anglican or Catholic. Those that advocate church activism, including James Murray (cited in Beresford, p125), argue that the churches are representative of society at large and deserve to be heard[and] have a vast amount of experience in social areas However, are they truly representative of society at large? Despite the 2001 Census results showing 68% of people identified with a Christian church, statistics from previous years show an increasingly secular society. ABS comparisons show that in 1901, 95.9% of the population were Christian. In 2001, 68% were Christian, 1.9% were Buddhist, 1.5% were Islam, and 25.3% stated they had no religion or refused to answer the question. (ABS 2001). So, despite the status of the church still being an influence, one could argue that as their numbers decline, so does the social status that accompanies it. This decrease in social status does affect the churches ability to influence policy, and even their ability to remain as insiders. Tony Abbott has frequently questioned the involvement of churches in policy decisions, and has called it a misuse of the prestige of the church.  On the flipside, groups with very little social, political or economic status are generally not represented in the upper echelons of government decision-making. Womens groups, despite the fact that they represent half of the population, are often kept as outsiders. Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, consulted with:    employers and employer groups, unions, women's groups and the community earlier in 2002. Over 250 submissions were received from employers and employer groups, unions, women's groups, community groups, Government, academics, individuals, health professionals, legal organisations and other interested parties. HREOC said the submissions overwhelmingly supported the introduction of a national Government- funded paid maternity scheme.  Despite this, no maternity leave provisions were made in the 2002 or 2003 budgets.   According to an article in The Age newspaper:  [Pru] was a long-time prime ministerial confidante, but indications are that a chill has descended upon the relationship, possibly over this issue. Goward says she and John Howard have not spoken about the paid maternity leave proposal for more than a year. Her proposal is not faring well in the inner circles of the Government. Canberra gossips speak of her being "frozen out" by the Prime Minister because she embarrassed him by championing a cause so allied to the Labor and union agenda. (Crabb, 2003).  Elite theory says that it is certain groups of people  those who have money, influence and status in society, that determine the political agenda, and those that do not have very little influence over government decisions. The social status of the groups being represented seems to be an indicator of whether they will be considered an insider or not. Pru Goward, once an insider, presented policy that was not consistent with the needs of business. She consulted hundreds of interest groups to formulate her report, and, as a result, was frozen out. The evidence shows that, at least in terms of insiders versus outsiders in Australian federal politics, there is most certainly an argument for the existence of elitism.  However, our pluralist democracy is not entirely lost. The Australian system of government allows for pluralist ideals in many ways, including: the federal system; a bicameral system of parliament; thriving local governments; and local community groups provide opportunities for interest groups to have their say on different policies. In the federal arena, the Senate has been a particularly effective system of checks and balances against pressure groups wielding too much power.   In conclusion, the evidence suggests that interest groups are not equal in terms of their access to government and in their effect on government policy  at least at the federal level. This is because those with more money, those that a bigger in size or those with a high status are generally more capable of lobbying the government. And, continuing from that, the evidence not only suggests inequality of access, but very high barriers to entry into the inner circle. This means that money, size and status, on their own, will not necessarily guarantee strong influence on the government, that it is actually the combination of these three factors that make that inner circle. The essence of elite theory with regard to interest groups supports the idea of a wealthy, powerful elite that affect government decisions. Given that a significant proportion of insiders groups are wealthy, large and have significant status, on the face of this we can say that federal politics is not particularly pluralist, and is, in fact, at least partly, elitist.

      I haven't written for some time, as many of you may be aware (if anyone is still reading this at all...). I have had a bit of a change recently. I changed jobs, which took me 800km away from Perth, in a beautiful, postcard-esque town called Esperance.  It is the first time I have lived away from Perth, and I must say it has taken some adjustment. I basically got offered a position as a social worker out of the blue, and had about 2 weeks to get all my stuff packed, Jason to give his notice, kiss everyone goodbye and head for Esperance.   And then, all of a sudden we were here, living 800 kilometres from home, still renting DVD's, still watching Foxtel, still trying desperately to stick to the low carb diet, still going to work everyday - only amidst this backdrop of sheer paradise. Look at this picture - this is literally 5 minutes from my house. It is really, really strange. And really, really surreal.      And life goes on. My family ring me asking "so, how is it in Esperance?" and I don't know what to say. I guess they want me to enthuse, or go into great detail about everything, but, at the end of the day, I guess I have already, in the space of six weeks, taken for granted the paradise I live in. It's really hard not to just say "You know, same old, same old" to your family when they ask, but, really, that's all it is. If you keep the same comforts, the same hobbies, and have your family around you, it's amazing how we can be satisfied wherever we are.  Occasionally I think of the distance and feel like I have been punched in the stomach for a few seconds, but I guess that goes with the territory. Occasionally I wonder if I made the right move career-wise, but then I remember that its all part of my life experience.  I hope that I can share some good experiences through this blog here: I have just had a conversation with my "supervisor" about creative expression and my work, and whether I can write about my experiences down here. You'll find some things shocking, i'll tell you... I am here as much for my own philosophical learning experience as I am to make a living, so I would really like to express it.  But, we'll see. Just thought I would check in and let everyone know that I am here, I am sane... I am just making sure I don't get fired for writing things ;)

       urlLink This is the key to my success... or is it?   It seems that publishers are now taking notice of the Blog thing. I'd better lift my game - who knows, there could be limitless fame and fortune awaiting me.  Or not.  We all know that most writers still survive on baked beans, even if they are published. Now,   children's books  , that's where the Harry-Potter-who-gives-a-shit-but-I-would-sure-like-to-write-sonmething-worth-billions successes are.  OK, I'm feeling a bit cynical today. I doubt anyone will be emailing me out of the blue asking me for my Michael Moore-esque rants in print...  But, if you are out there, I will wave like an uncomfortable Sim without a chair at you and hope for the best.

Bush suffered minor abrasions to his chin, upper lip, nose, right hand and both knees, but was able to ride back home, Duffy said.

Bush was wearing a helmet and a mouth guard when he fell, Duffy said.   Buahahahahaha! He wore a mouthguard riding a bicycle?   In January 2002, Bush fainted for a brief time in the residence of the White House while eating a pretzel and watching a professional football game on television.   OK, so let me get this straight. Our wartime President get injured twice in his term. Once from falling of a bike and the other from choking on a pretzel. Its no surprise this guy wears a mouthguard whilst riding a bicycle - he seems a little accident-prone. :)

      Normally I am a good sport. Really, I am. I applied for an internal vacancy yesterday back in Perth, and it took no more than 12 hours to get this reply:   Tea, thank you for your expression of interest for the advertised position.  You have not been successful.   Wow, geez, thanks. I mean, I know how the public service works: they advertise internal vacancies in order to renew existing contracts, but still... where is the honesty? Being the bundle of self-loathing mess that I am, I naturally assume it was something to do with me and my application that made me get rejected. Not only that, getting rejected so quickly after the application...ARGH. But, I am a wuss. You know what I did? Little miss polite Téa just replies:    Hi xxx, Could you please provide some feedback about why I was not considered for the role?     Pussy!  That was NOT what I was thinking at all. Here is what I would have LIKED to have written:    I really wanted to say "Dear Sir, Sorry to have WASTED your time with a job I am obviously overqualified for. Seeing as you have obviously not taken the time to assess my application on its merits, could you at least tell me WHY so that I can shatter any further hope of fulfilling anything even remotely close to my goal? Or at least reevaluate why the hell I even bother with a Masters degree to miss out on a paltry Level 4 position?  And, for the record, I will have your job one day.   Bitchy, I know. But damn, I wish I could have been honest about it. They say that the process is meant to be fair and open. Bullshit. Like I said, normally I am a good sport, and I do understand how it all works. But it doesn't help being on the receiving end of it.

       urlLink The America We Know   I found it interesting that I was saying a similar thing this time last year around the war. Of course, I used  urlLink  Michael Jackson and Saddam Hussein , but hey, maybe I could be a paid writer too...  If you go back and read what I wrote, you will notice that I was commenting on the way war is presented, or represented, on commercial television. My friends, the events of the past few weeks are what I was waiting for.   Now, don't get me wrong - it is horrific what is happening and the images are very upsetting - but I was waiting for this. I was hoping for the gory details to snap people out of the dream world that has been created for us by the media. For once we are being forced to confront the violence and the human suffering that has been caused by this invasion.  So, I want to give a big thumbs up to the journalists that exposed the gritty reality of this war. The more we see, the more we'll be outraged. And the more we are outraged - and the more we are witness to the tragedy of war - the more we will oppose it. And the more we oppose it, the more resistant we will be to Bush and his ilk the next time they drag us into a war nobody wants.

      It is interesting how much you learn about yourself when you're least expecting it. Right now I am homesick as hell, and feel a bit like I could easily just jump in the car, drive home, and start all over again. And sometimes, I can't help but think I have made a horrible mistake by dragging my family to a small town, a small office and a job that..sometimes...I don't know that I committed to anymore. I feel like I have forfeited all my chances of promotion into a policy job, its really hard to make friends and the work is hard. Actually, hard doesn't do it justice. It's painful sometimes. For weeks I have been thinking "what does this mean?", "why can't I commit to this job?". Well, in part, its because I took a huge risk - jumping into a field that is different to what I am used to - but part of it is around me and my broader search for meaning. And I found it in the most unlikely of places.  I watched eLove on the Lifestyle channel last night, which is a reality show cum documentary about internet love. A divorced American Policeman had been chatting to an English woman for over a year. He had told her "I love you", they had phone conversations, they had shared photos and webcams, emailed back and forth, chatted, talked obsessively about each other to their friends... well, you get the picture. Then, this eLove show comes along, pays for her to go to New York to meet him...with sexy results. OK, no sexy results, but that's just a lame thing I say ;)  Anyway, despite this electronic barrage of intimate secret sharing, joking, and mutual "I Love You" sessions, the American policeman ended up not only rejecting the pommie lady, but he CUT THE DATE SHORT! Now, this could be a reflection of his personality (I mean, NY Policeman: read moustache, chewing gum and a loud mouth - a walking stereotype), or it could be a broader comment around human nature.  Of course, it wouldn't be a very interesting blog if I just called him a jerk, so of course I am going to say that it is something bigger than that. It is about fantasy and reality, and how we always want what we can't have.  Internet relationships are a little like the fantasy of living and working in a small town. You build up this fantasy of how different life would be if you were away, or if this person you had fantasised about were with you. You create a magical place, where you can relax, socialise effortlessly, and run through daisies in a meadow.  And then you do it. You decide to turn this fantasy into reality. And that reality is nothing like you thought it would be. It is the day-to-day, warts and all, experience of what you had conjured up in your head. If you had experienced this without the fantasy, it wouldn't be a disappointment - it would just be life. But, because you've dreamt about it for a long time, often because of a desire to escape this bitch called reality, it will never, EVER live up to the glossy images.  It's a bit like holidays. You pour over the glossy magazines of white sandy beaches and cafés, but when you get there, you realise that there is gastro, homelessness and human suffering outside the cosy confines of the resort. Internet relationships are exactly the same. No matter how honest particpants profess to be with each other, you are still only seeing the magazine article. You are not hearing the loudmouth policeman, or smelling the bad breath in the morning, or having to deal with that person rolling their eyes when you speak.  And in Esperance, despite its physical beauty, there is an undercurrent of religious zeal, homelessness, depression, cliquey-ness and cold. Lots of cold. The reality is just far too much. Then you start to yearn for the days where life was better: the warm fuzzy feeling you got when you were in-a-relationship-with-no-human-contact, writing nice notes and having heartfelt discussions. And you were only dreaming about moving to the country, but still living a life you like.  On eLove, they pommie chick and the policeman managed to salvage their friendship via email, but it will never be the same. Most of these come-crashing-down-to-reality experiences change you at your core. Part of it is growing up and realise that you cannot escape the reality of life, and part of it is the disappointment associated with it.  I will go home to the city soon, having learnt that maybe I made a huge mistake. But, on the other hand, I can take some relief in the fact that if I didn't experience it, I would never have learned that real life isn't so bad.

      ...to the Australian Flag, whether I want to or not.  urlLink Schools forced to fly the flag   C'mon, John. Get real. Do you really think that this is a real issue? Of course you don't. What this is, however, is your acknowledgement of your failure to win the aspirational, under-50 voters back from Mark Latham. So now, what you are doing is appealing to the grey RSL regulars that you *know* dominate our society. You've gone back to Johnny heartland: the voters that are resistant to change; resistant to dissent; and, above all, resistant to those pesky young-folk that have no respect for their elders.  You have to wonder why, John, when you pull such cynical stunts such as this. it shows a politician that is desperate: trying to exploit the racist, conservative heartland - instead of making politics about ideas, you make it about winning.  I have to ask: what happens to the Aboriginal children? Will their flag be displayed alongside the Australian flag as a symbol of unity? Or will the Australian flag be it - a symbol of the "like it or leave it" attitude of colonialism? A symbol of pride for some, but a symbol of oppression for others?  John, you have successfully reversed most of the things that have made this country great and unique. It is only when I get a tolerant Australia with a flag that does not have the Union Jack on it (first and foremost) that I will stand proud. Until then, I will write this off as yet another political stunt from a cynical politician, desperate to cling onto his power base.

      Normally I leave Big Brother commentary to those who are  urlLink better at it than I am , but I just can't leave last Sunday's eviction show without commenting on it.  For those that did not see it, the 5th evictee, Merlin, walked down the plank to the stage. He put gaffa tape on his mouth, help up a sign "free the refugees" and refused to talk to Gretel (who handled it fabulously given the circumstances), with sexy results.  Now, there were two great things that came out of this show. Firstly, it showed tremendous courage on Merlin's part. Secondly, I think it showed a new, young side of Australia that is really encouraging - and rare - to see on national television.  When Merlin jumped out of the car, you could see that he was extremely nervous. There were thousands (is it thousands? I looked like it) of people cheering him on. He fiddled with the sign and the tape for a while and everyone was collectively wondering "what the hell is he up to?". And then he pulled it out. A shitty sign with "Free the Refugees" on it. And it gets better... he WALKED RIGHT PAST GRETEL AND SAT DOWN, gaffa tape on, and refused to talk. I nearly peed my pants from that one! But you could see it in his eyes - he looked like he wanted to cry, apologise and take it all back, but he stood his ground.  I just have to say that it was phenomenally brave of Merlin to do such a thing, with the audience booing (why?!), and Gretel trying to salvage what was left of the eviction show. It was one of those great moments in television... where a leftie got one over the big guys :)  The main thing that surprised me, however, is the way the housemates reacted to Merlin's message. We hear on talkback radio that refugees are "dangerous terrorists", that the majority of Australians support mandatory detention, and that to support their freedom would be "unAustralian". But I saw something very different. For me it showed a huge cultural shift that represents how Generation X & Y are ignored in public debate. Sure, Big Brother is hardly representative of young Australia, but its all we've got for now... and I liked what I saw. People who were tolerant of Merlin's opinion (and most even agreed with him), had great respect for him and defended him over and over.  The way the housemates reacted gave me more than pure voyeuristic pleasure - it gave me a sense of confidence that things will eventually be ok. Baby boomers dominate the political scene, and whilst it is their democratic right to do so, we often lose sight of the younger generations' opinions - generally opinions supportive of multiculturalism, diversity, postmodern theory, and most importantly, a strong sense of justice.  It sure made me feel good for a fleeting moment. Of course, then I read the newspaper again and I turned into a frustrated young person again. But hey, it was a special moment, even if it did only last an hour.    Good on ya Merlin...

      I wasn't going to update until my last essay and exam were out of the way at the end of the week, but hey, What would study be without procrastination?  Yesterday I had a job interview for a really good [Policy] position that I thought I had absolutely no chance of getting. To make matters worse, living 800km from Perth meant that I had to have a phone interview. And, my god, was that the worst possible thing that could ever happen to anyone.  Public service positions are based on merit based selection, and that is great. But when you are already a bundle of nerves and cannot even SEE the people that are interviewing you, it adds a whole new dimension to the interview experience.  So, being the self-loathing, agonised writing-type with absolutely NO idea why I was even being interviewed in the first place, you can imagine how much fun I had...  First, I had to talk about community engagement principles, my understanding of domestic violence and the state strategic plan and all that... and I did really well. The boss-man was making jokes and seemed to understand what I was getting at most of the time (which is new for me... it must be a policy-person thing, where there is an unspoken understanding of sleepless nights thinking about political problems!).  I made a comment early in the interview that it is hard to know whether I am saying the right thing, oe boring them to death because I can't see their faces. Big Kahuna laughed and said "don't worry, we're all smiling"  So, anyway, I was doing really well. Then, I got an EASY question. An EASY question that I just could not answer, despite me having done several interviews in the past and being acutely aware of the position and everything that it involves. ARGH! Here's a little transcript.  Interviewer: "So, Téa, knowing that this is a small office whose decisions can impact on a whole state of women, government employees' practice and the community at large, how would this affect the way that you do your work."  (silence)  (more silence)  Me [thinking]: "Shit... potentially 2 million people..." Me [talking]: "I would utilise community engagement principles of course..."  Interviewer: "What skills do you believe you could bring to the position,  in that context?"  (silence)  Me: "Good communication skills, good team skills as it is a small policy unit, good understanding of community engagement principles, including having an awareness of cultural diversity, researching and educating myself about these things..."  (silence)  Me: "Do you want to know specifically  how  I would communicate?"  Interviewer: Yes.  Me: "I'm sorry, you know how something just...well..leaves your head? I know this stuff!"  Interviewer: "It's ok, I think you've touched on what we need..."  And then, we moved onto Q&A time, where I asked if I was shortlisted, because I was surprised I was selected for an interview. He said that I had been shortlisted from a huge number of applicants and that my applciation was really strong. Wowee. Bit of a confidence boost for me, considering the job that this is...  So, anyway, now I wait. And I agonise. Apparently I will hear on Monday. Damn them for making me wait all weekend! I don't want to be overly confident, after all, in hindsight I cannot believe the things I forgot to say... but hey... wish me luck.  And tell me if you think I got the job. I went to  urlLink Facade  for some Tarot insight and it gave me a really good card, which means excitement, rebirth and challenges. So yeah... anyway, how this ended up so long I have no idea.

       urlLink To add insult to injury...   Doctors want an extra $675 a week. Well, whoopee. Since when have doctors been the only professionals that deserve a payrise in our public health system? Not only that, but $675 a week is more than the average nurse or social worker EARNS.  It's an absolute joke. I don't care if I piss off doctors - I am all for investing in the health system, but demanding a raise that is more money than most people, including nurses, orderlies, social workers, hospital administrators, and so on earn... it is absolutely disgraceful.  Sure, they are overworked, and sure 20 hour shifts are ridiculous, but until everyone gets greater recognition of their skills in the health sector, I am not about to start crying over someone that earns $130,000 a year.

       urlLink ...but only if you're American.   First of all I want to get this off my chest: "what a load of shit". Now, let me get to the real stuff.  Australia is one of the truly democratic nations in the world. Sure, it isn't perfect - like most nations it is run by wealthy white heterosexual men and has a long history of native blood going splat in the name of Christianity. But hey, which country doesn't?!  One thing we can be proud of, despite our ills, is that we have a nation that is pretty darn good in comparison to other "democracies". We have a system of compulsory, preferential voting that ensures everybody's vote (whether informed or not) counts. We have a vibrant pluralist system (occasionally), a strong bureaucracy (despite it being undermined in recent years) with fairly good appeals processes, and most importantly, a parliament that allows for alternative policies to the government of the day. Not only that, we have two current affairs shows that ensure that just about anyone can get their opinions heard. Unless of course you're a hippy, a bureaucrat, a welfare worker, a dodgy builder or any sort of do-gooder. Alas, I digress.  I was talking about how Australia is a democratic nation, with a parliament that allows for something that is strange to the likes of George Bush: a viable opposition. Mark Latham, as the next Prime Minister of this country, has the FREEDOM, through this DEMOCRATIC institution that he is about to lead, to express his point of view on Iraq. Now, I may diagree with Mark Latham's position on many things, but on this one I think he is right on the money. But, that is beside the point.  George Bush walks around, bible in hand, dribbling rhetoric about "freedom" and "democracy", but does not promote it in his policies, in his speeches or in Iraq. But of course, we all know that America is an autocracy disguised cleverly as a democracy. George Bush acts  in spite of  public opinion and without the mandate of the American people. People cannot forget that. But again, I digress.  This democracy that Australia has, as complex as it may be, is more representative than America. Here, the government of the day, for better or worse, has the mandate of the Australian people. Sure, they are accountable in the Senate, but Australians like it that way. If the ALP win this election, troops will be withdrawn from Iraq. This means that Mark Latham will have the mandate of the majority of Australians to withdraw troops from Iraq.  Surely George Bush would not argue with that? After all, he is such a huge fan of freedom and democracy...

Darn it.   urlLink It sucks to be you .  Apparently so-named because if you are reading his blog, you truly are pathetic ;) But hey...  Here's a shout out to Jason.

       urlLink Cheney's slick deal for old firm    Is anyone as surprised as I am?  (not)   And here's another one.  urlLink "Sorry" Sign to ease road rage   I have two cracks I can make here:  1) If I have to have a sign that says "I'm Sorry", then I also want one that will flip the bird. Or, perhaps, a big red boxing glove on a spring that you can eject. What movie was that again? 2) I wonder if the Prime Minister will use his? It seems the words "I'm Sorry" are not his favourite. The light may result in an admiision of guilt, and we don't want that now, do we?  hmm...

      OK, I couldn't let this one go by without at least a comment. I think that  urlLink this  is one of the poorest pieces of journalism I have EVER seen in a Murdoch paper. And that really is saying a lot, given that, well, it's Murdoch.  My question is, why is Natasha Stott-Despoja's eligibility for the $3000 maternity payment even relevant to the debate, other than, of course, to try and make a mockery of a young working woman's opinion that the payment is nothing but a whitewash? I imagine that the writer (or writers, given that the Murdoch press usually have a few staff writers working on one 200 word article) was trying to point out some sort of irony, or try to counter Natasha's valid criticism of the maternity payment by pointing out an inconsistency (if there is one at all).  I just don't get what the purpose of this story is, because it fails in the irony stakes, it fails to counter Natasha's view... perhaps it is a politically motivated page-filler to further relegate women's issues to pettiness and mockery. Oh. I think thats exactly what it is. In amongst the adverts and stories about chickens that can talk is this little ditty about the critic of the maternity allowance being eligible for the payment...  What people are forgetting, firstly, is that both the $800 maternity payment and baby bonus (worth up to $2500) have been replaced by this allowance. It is not a new allowance, it is merely consolidated benefits. Secondly, those who work prior to pregnancy are still going to be worse off as a result of having a baby due to forfeiting a salary. Thirdly, the payment is not "family" friendly for one important reason: there are a lot of families out there that have finished having their babies and need to cope with the day-to-day. A truly "family-friendly" policy needs to account for the mothers who spend half their income on childcare, rack up debt with a no-win-situation, otherwise called the Family Assistance Office, and, of course... young families being crippled by HECS debts, and unable to buy houses amongst other things.  And, of course, assuming that all families have a stay-at-home mother in a heterosexual marriage (as defined by the Marriage Act amendments) and living behind a white picket fence... BLERGH! Come off it John. This payment is nothing but another conservative sweetener to keep women as breeders, but providing absolutely no assistance to women who do not stay at home with their children.      Making childcare tax deductible  - now THAT is a policy that supports families.   Paying full maternity leave for 14 weeks  - now THAT is a policy that supports families.   Investing decent amounts of money into Medicare and scrapping the private health rebate   - now THAT is a policy that supports families.   Not penalising people who get an education  - now THAT is a policy that supports families.   Not having a "Family Tax Benefit" system whereby 650,000 families have a debt   - now THAT is a policy that supports families.   I don't think it's that fair to expect fairness from the Daily Telegraph - after all, they are not renowned for the world's greatest journalism - but the least they can do is TRY to have an actual story when they write about something.  Family policy is something that I have a particular interest in, so excuse the rant. But I expect far better from people that get paid to write about these issues. After all, I am just a lowly unpaid blogger and I can come up with *something* of substance.

      I quit the job today. It was quite a nerveracking experience for me, because I am not very good at quitting jobs, especially when I have only been there for a week!  My supervisor is really nice. She made me feel really welcome and is a really positive person to work for. The rest of the team are also really good, so, with liking my workmates and&nbsp;enjoying the job I did what any sane person would do: I quit.  I walked in this morning, feeling like crap (I have had an ear infection for the last 3 days and I feel like I am being stabbed in the head with a pumpkin), and having braved yet another hour-long drive from home to work, I make morning niceties such as "hello, how are you" etc... and then I tell my supervisor how I didn't do the whiteboard on onday because I needed some stuff explained to me. Then, she said something and went to answer her phone.  About half an hour later, and after some agonising on my part, she came and sat on my desk and said "I've got a really good job for you". I cut her off and said "at the whiteboard, we got interrupted."  I flinched. I then said that I was planning to quit working and focus on Mina and full time study. They didn't take it very well at all. They put massive guilt trips on me for taking the job (which I think is fair enough), and blah dee blah...  Anyway... I am tired now. Will try to post something of more substance later on.

      ...to have my feet firmly planted on the ground after a couple of weeks of chaos.   I finally made it back to Perth on the 10th, and the dust has only just settled, as I was only given a week to start the job I was offered. However, this week I have decided to quit and focus on my studies and do some preliminary studies for my Grad Dip Ed next year.  I have a 50 minute drive to and from work, and have a few problems with stress and palpitations (for which I am seeing a cardiologist next week! argggh), and, as you can imagine, being stuck in traffic is not that good for my health. Also, the money I am shelling out for daycare and the time I am forfeiting with my daughter just doesn't make it worth it.  So I am going back to uni full time as of next week, staying at home with Mina and enjoying it for the next year and a half until I become a high school teacher. Woohoo!

       urlLink Read this article   The concept of freedom of speech is yet again undermined by the bible belt loonies in the US. WHy on earth would SlimFast be so opposed to Whoopi's comments? Surely they aren't naive enough to support Bush?  Then again, they are a money-grubbing corporation that is profiting from the obesity epidemic, so I guess that its not that hard to believe...
