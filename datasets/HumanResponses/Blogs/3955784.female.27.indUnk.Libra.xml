      so i went camping this past weekend...and it was fabulous! sand! beaches!  NO RACOONS!! thank goodness everything was great...until....yesterday... lying out on the beach...i came to start thinkin about getting a lot of sun and the fact that i have this strange idea that my skin is "sunburn proof" umm... well with red hair...and fairly dainty skin(not pale like a typical redhead but still gets that flourecent pink glow when burnt) you would figure that i would have taken some precautions so that i didnt get so red i looked like a lobster after a fresh steam bath! now i am paying for my sun obsession...and boy am i paying! the PAIN!!! the INSANITY! my only solace is that after this burn turns a lovely shade of brown i will NEVER EVER EVER have to go suntanning this summer! and boy o boy do i love uv and ub rays!:)

      ok...so i am going to start this post in the form of a question...then i will answer it...to an extent. why is it that people who dont want to be the center of "gossip" constantly put themselves in that position??????????? but then bitch and moan about it constantly!?! it is one of the most irritating things to me... i have this friend at work who has, in the past, been a bit of the center of gossip and controversy at work...so lately she has stayed out of the limelite...until now... we have a bunch of students working at my work for the summer...and there is one guy...who was nice enough in the beginning but now is just really freakin annoying...anyhow... so she has started chatting with him...harmlessly enough...but by now it has become painfully apparent that he has a super huge crush on her(she...btw...is in a 10year relationship with someone who she wants to marry) anyhow...she feeds into it...so much so that she hasnt even told this guy she has a bf... i have mentioned some things to her in hopes she gets the hint as just about EVERYONE is talking about what is going on...but she ends up getting pissed off at me... but still...guess who she is going to complain to when she starts realizing how much people are talking about her! ME and you know what im going to tell her?! IF YOU WERENT SUCH A DISRESPECTFUL BITCH YOU WOULDNT HAVE THIS PROBLEM! i mean come on...shes in a relationship with someone she "loves" and yet she carries on like this...*shakes head* its irritating...i mean i could understand it too if he was cute...(which hes not) or someone tolerable to be around(again...which he is not) but hes NOT!!!!!!!!!!!   GET A CLUE GIRL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ok im done

      my moms cousins arrived from england yesterday... what is it with airports anyhow...there are thousands of people arriving every day...practically every 5 mins...and yet it still takes them like an hour to get off the plane! insane! and then you stand there waiting and waiting constantly looking at the time because you know how much you are going to be paying the damn parking meter and you keep seeing all these strangers coming through the doors...its never your relatives...brutal... there were these two women there waiting for someone...and you should have seen them!! dressed to the nines...but not the "look nice" nines...more like the 8 1/2's...they looked like cheap hookers...why is it people think that they look nice when they look like that? do they have some magic mirror at home that shows them some altered reality? *shudders* anyhow...im done rambling

        ok...so this is the second time im attempting to post this one....grrr... my computer geek friend helped me change the "skin" on this page...when did the terminology change by the way...where was i? and was i sleeping?! back in the day it used to be called a background! maybe it was called a skin all along and we were all just enormously misinformed! that is probably the case anyhow...i wont waste anymore time...:)

      so i have been watching "joe schmo 2" and have decided that i would be great on a reality tv show! im just clueless enough to fall for some fake show like that! i mean i think i would question things going on that are as hokey as on joe schmo...but i dont think i would really be able to figure it out! and the same with the amazing race...that is a great show! i would be good on that one...but i think i would need to find someone to be partners with that would be able to take verbal abuse.  so in other words...my mother would be out...so would the bf...i think id have to go in it with my good buddy...my partner in crime...T...only because she could dish it out as well as she could take it.   *but* i dont think she would be able to handle the "roughing" it parts of the show... so i guess now i am accepting applications for a partner for the next amazing race... that is...if they ever let canadians in it! also...big brother would be a good show for me...im just cute and funny and modest(;p) enough to be able to win the hearts of everyone... that or i would be too annoying and too fat and would be the first one voted out! plus....me no look goodie in bikini...*shudders* ha! so what reality show do you think you would last the longest on?  pass this on to your friends...make a game out of it...hell...make an evening out of it!

They never seem to be long enough.   Men are like........Weather........... Nothing can be done to change them.   Men are like........Blenders.......... You need one, but you're not quite sure why.   Men are like........Chocolate Bars........ Sweet, smooth, & they usually head right for your hips.   Men are like........Commercials........You can't believe a word they say.   Men are like........Department Stores........Their clothes are always 1/2 off.   Men are like........Government Bonds........They take soooooo long to mature.

      that everyone should have... a friend of mine(a bitchy one at that) sent this to me!  i thought it was cute...so here it is.....  As I've Matured...  I've learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is stalk them and hope they panic and give in...   I've learned that one good turn gets most of the blankets.   I've learned that no matter how much I care, some people are just jackasses.   I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and it only takessuspicion, not proof, to destroy it.   I've learned that whatever hits the fan will not be evenly distributed.   I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to others - they are more screwed up than you think.   I've learned thatdepression is merely anger without enthusiasm.   I've learned that it is not what you wear; it is how you take it off.   I've learned that you can keep vomiting long after you think you'refinished.   I've learned to not sweat the petty things, and not pet the sweaty things.   I've learned age is a very high price to pay for maturity.   I've learned that I don't suffer from insanity, I enjoy it.   I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, unless we are celebrities.   I've learned that artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity.   I've learned that 99% of the time when something isn't working in your house, one of your kids did it   I've learned that there is a fine line between genius and insanity.   I've learned that the people you care most about in life are taken from you too soon and all the less important ones just never go away. And the real pains in the ass are permanent.     ****i think she sent this with me in mind over the last one!! MUAHAHAHAHA******
