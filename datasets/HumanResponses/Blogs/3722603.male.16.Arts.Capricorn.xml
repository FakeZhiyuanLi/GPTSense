Tour,THESE ARE GOOD TIMES. so im going to list my hotties, there are many, but ill try to keep them to the HOTTEST HOTTIES, like on VH1. (these arent in any order, just as i start remembering them) jennifer lopez,jessica simpson,jessica alba,NOT BRITNEY SPEARS AND PARIS HILTON UGH AND THAT OTHER UGLY ASS ON THE SIMPLE LIFE,the girl in "day after tomorrow", kristen kruek, ur mom, halle berry, keira knightley,the indian chick from "bend it liek beckham" oh, posh spice, leah remini, ben stillers wife, lucy liu,charlize theron, the harp player lol. thats it for now but i shit you not, the list continues. booz chauncey

      i liek the wierdest music. for example, to day i went to tower and bought 3 cd's. i got the franz ferdinand cd the d-12 cd cuz i lost mine, then the jedi mind tricks "violent by design" if u know any of these groups, you would knwo that none of them have anything in common except for d-12 and jedi, but only cuz they are both rap groups, however, they rap about totally different things. basically, jedi raps about some shit that d-12 is too main stream to rap about, such as the "game", cuz if d-12 tried to rap about that, they would be mocked, cuz they alreay made it, whereas jedi is still underground. so, i have a large range of music going from classical(brahms) which in itslef has many different periods to it, to rock(hoobastank) to metal(SOAD) to rap(eminem). rap and classical i say are the best, cuz when combined, u get artists liek jedi mind tricks who are truely, the best of bothc worlds, unlike R kely, and jay-z, BUT jay-z is a sick ass rapper anyways. chauncey

      alright, so i was driving down to san mateo with my mom to go to my brothers rehab meeting, which by the way was lovely(will ferrell from "old school") ANYWAYS,and this fucken truck fucken streaks in front of our car, making my mom swerve the car. so at first i was like " wtf, that almost made me shit in my pants" cuz seriously, i was frightened for the moment. but soon after, the car that cut in front of us stopped, then started up, then stopped, then started up. THIS CONTINUED FOR A GOOD 15 SECONDS. then this woman raises her fucken crusty hand through the sun roof, flipping us off. LOL, so my mom tried to do it back, but she has tendinitis in her left hand, so it came out as a sort of " fist" instead of a flipping of the bird.LOL, but the woman got the point. so the woman gets into the lane next to us, and slows down so that she is right next to ME,talking to me. she says " you cant just fucken cut me off like that!" and i rolled up the window and acted like i didnt notice her yelling at us. BUT this made it worse, she got back in front of us. WHOA, U MUST UNDERSTAND THAT WE WERE GOING LIKE 60 ON THE FREEWAY DURING THIS WHOLE TIME. back to the story,  so when she was back in front, she reached for somehting in the backseat of her truck and pulled out a drum stick. then she started twirling it in front of the rearview mirror, LOL, and then she dropped it in the seat, went to look for it, then she changed lanes, and never came back. In the end, i feel sorry for her. She was trying to be all hard and shit, and ended up looking liek a retard dropping the drum stick.w/e tho. I hope i am doing this whoole " blog" thing right, cuz i have nothign else to say besides what happened in my day. chauncey

      alright, FIRST OF ALL, my fucken haircut sucks my moms booty crack. SECONDLY, NEVER EVER GO TO SUPERCUTS!  This one time when I was in 7th grade, I went to supercuts right before the year started. I wanted to get like a 2 on the sides and about an inch off my 3 inch long hair on top. However the Asian lady how was about to butcher my hair never really heard what I said. I heard her murmur something along the lines of "askhfgasjkfgjkg  2 OK! asfdhibasjkgvaha" so I was like OK, maybe she will give me a much betetr haircut than I was use to receiving. BUT, the fucken woman gave me a 2 all the way around, leaving me with a shaved head. Today, I went in and got my haircut. It wasn't THE WORST HAIRCUT I've ever gotten, but nothing is evenly cut, and there are patches of hair that are much more dense than others. I've gone to supercuts between those 3 years, but supercust just isn't that great of a place. IM sure there are a few hear and there that have actual barbers, but in the end, they just aren't great haircutists. i leave for tour in 5 days. I hella wanted that loyd banks cd, but it comes out the day after I leave. DUDE, i want to see spiderman 2, looks hella good. I saw around the world in 80 days, it was alright, better than expected which is good and i saw dodgeball, SO FUCKEN HILARIOUS. damn, i dont think anyone can capture such moron-ness better than ben stiller. chauncey

      during the school year i was always busy. i usually woke up before school at like 5 a.m. so i could practice for about an hour and a half. after practicing, i would take a shower get dressed read the sports page and datebook, then drive to school. THEN there would be school, which for me, is at Stuart Hall High School which is a really small boys school near japan town. its not a great school, but for me it is perfect. i can co exactly what i want to do which is to get my school shit done, have a few close people that i basically only hang out with all year cuz everyone else is REALLY COOL.... play baseball whihc is the best sport ever next to baskteball and football, and focus on my music outside of school. So for my pusposes, Stuart Hall is fine.during baseball season, i would go to practice everyday after school until about 6, then come home, do my homework, then go to sleep and wake up and practice and condoing that cycle of nonstop madness everyday until now, which is summer time. this summer is really busy for me. i had a recital, which i just finished , and it was a lot better than i thought it would be, then i have tour with SFYO. the SFYO tour is gonna be fucken tight. we're going to france, austria, amsterdam, germany and somewhere else i cant remember. the best part of it is that im going to get to chill with a lot of people i grew up with at TCS, my junior high school. so hopefully tha will be cool. OH YA, weed is legal in amsterdam, so if you're there, look for me in those coffee shops that have it on their menu's............JAY KAY. after i get back from tour, im going to drive down to LA wiht my sister and cousin and go to disneyland for a few days. ok fine, disneyland isn't the coolest place ever, but shit, a roadtrip wiht my closest people is gonna be sick regardless of where we are going.  after the road trip, im going to england which is followd by a camping trip to mendocino to close out the summer. back to " having nothing to do is fucken wierd", until monday the 28th, i have jack shit to do. THE ANTICIPATION for tour is gettig to be too much for me to handle. everyday gets longer and longer as each hour seems to last for a century. NOW i realize how easy it is for people to ramblke on and on in these things, so im goign to stop. im sure this is stupid but, it is my first online diary shit post thing ever so have fun. chauncey P.S. fucken lakers.............. GIANTS BABY   YEAEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH

      So i was talking to this guy and he was like," OH MY GOD, how long does it take a black woman to take a shit?" I, along with all the other "PC" people i was standing with did not move a muscle. " 9 MONTHS. HAHA isn't that funny?" I had to keep my dumbass from wetting myself in the pants. That could possibly be one of the most racist, offensive HILARIOUS jokes i've ever heard. ANYWAYS, im just getting ready for my trip to England.&nbsp; I dont really know all of the people im going there with, but the 10 hour flight should allow me enough time to become friendly with my new posse. Oh ya, my mom needs to DIE. I just realized how much of a bitch my mom is. My friends, lol, use to tell me " your mom is like fucken scruff Mc gruff" LOL, at the time, I&nbsp;would&nbsp; cock slap them and tell them to never say that again. Now? I AGREE WITH THEM. my mom needs to get laid or eat some fruit or do anything that gets her to chill out. I mean i use to think it was impossible to walk around with a cock in ur ass(ron gallman LOL) but NOOOOOOOOOOO. my mom proved me wrong by achieving the impossible. she just needs to back the fuck off of me and learn how to deal with her issues without yelling at me. FUCKEN BITCH. so my trip to england should be fricken awesome. did u know that people in Britain call c smokes FAGS? i know its not that funny, but it still is wierd.&nbsp; but here is my checklist 1- get a haircut, I LOOK LIKE JESUS 2- go out with katy(hell yea pacifica) 3- buy some POUNDS, british currency 4- pack for the trip 5-charge my i-pod 6- make sure i have all of my extra shit for the trip like cell phone cords, i pod cords, and gameboy shit, and condoms, my hat, my music, i was JOSHIN about the condoms. 7- cock slap my mom 8- thats it 9- i  WAS  serious about cock slapping my mom. for now,  chauncey

      First off, im&nbsp;not actually a bitch, ILL KILL YOU if u call me one. JAYKAY,not really though. SECONDLY, so theres this girl that i sorta like. I dont know how im going to tell her. most people ive talked to about it say i should go ahead and tell her, but im hesitant to do so. i know she doesnt like me, but I feel obligated to tell her for some reason. I know FUNNY GIRL thinks i should not do it, but im going to. It will alleviate myself of any obligations ..............anyways, im just over analyzing&nbsp; LIKE A LITTLE GIRLY BITCH. THERE I ADMIT IT. ARE U HAPPY NOW??????. Lastly, i need to go back to europe NOW. its like a&nbsp; fricken drug man, I want more of it. Mainly the alcohol purchasing at the age of SIXTEEN. but the places were nice too, and so was this girl that i liked. w/e tho, its all behind and now i get to look forward to..... o wait, thats right, NOTHING! NOTHNG!= summer reading, school, life at home with my family, and the list keeps going and going and going. peace chauncey

I CANT FUCKEN STAND BEING HOME WITH MY FAMILY. IM READY TO GO TO ENGLAND ALREADY. but i have 11 days until that happens. im just going to have to bare down, and deal with it. im fucken pathetic, im bitching about having a home to stay in, LOL, fuck it. chauncey

      so i just got back from my trip to europe with the SFYO. in short, it was just fucken crazy. everything you think i did, i probably did. we went to germany france austria and NETHERLANDS, home of amsterdam, home of the red light district which is a place where prostitution, and weed are legal( throughout all of the netherlands tho,). so you would see a prostitute in every window practically, just waiting to have a client.  justine patrick and myself went on a mission. we tried to take pictures with the prostitutes to bring back home. LOL, but see, we didnt want the hookers to feel us up like they do to all other customers, so patrick and I often told them we were gay so they would talk to us, and not grab our reproductive organs, which ONE BITCH DID. FUCKEN PROSTITUTE, anyways,while patrick and I were doing that, justine would take a picture of us, or the other way around. either way, we took a lot of pictures. but then, justine left her camera on the bus, so off with that bus went our shots, and our evidence of what we did. i bet most people wont believe what we did, but w/e. tour was just fucken great. i mean I was allowed to buy alcohol, everywhere except fucken cologne, germany. but man, i met some new friends, baileys, JD, smirnoff, and cola. Along with maryjane. TOUR WAS FUCKEN AWESOME on the other hand, i was in to this girl who i wont name, but most people know who she is. nothign really happened, but i found out how she feels about me, and now that i know that, it will be easier to talk to her. Fuck it, i shouldn't stress&nbsp;out over her. what happened, happened, and nothign can be changed so all i can do is&nbsp;wait until&nbsp;next year when i see her again.&nbsp; i just realized it is like 1 15, and i need to go to sleep. chauncey &nbsp; OH YA, I NEED TO SEE ( I ROBOT, SPIDERMAN 2, KING ARTHUR, ANCHORMAN, AND SOME FUCKEN GIANTS GAMES) fucken giants, i left and they were 3 and 1/2 up, now they are like 1/2 out. " warriors about to sign derek fisher?" about time, we got an actual player. now all we need to do is get one more player liek him, and we may have a decent team. cept we dont have a center besides foyle cuz dampier left. starting rotation derek fisher, jason richardson, troy murphy, mike dunleavy, and adonal foyle. i mean we do have some bench, clifford robinson, calbert cheaney, speedy claxton. if we add someone along ther skills of antanw jamison, we would be set. WHY DID WE TRADE HIM??????? our rotation could be somehting like fisher, richardson,jamison, dunleavy and dampier. YES we would ahve dampier cuz we would want to stay cuz we woudl have a good rotation. BUT THE FUCKEN WARRIORS ARE STUPID SO THEY ALWAYS FUCK SHIT UP FOR THEMSELVES. oh ya FUCK THE LAKERS. if only they couldve kept shaq, seriously. say goodbye to their dynasty. payotn and malone i THINK are finished, and all they have is kobe. they will always bebetter than the warriors, but they wontbe the same unless they get yao ming.
