      Saddenin. Y do sad tinks always happen together? I'm feelin so regretful now. Wishin tt i had not meet 2 frenz in my life now. Frens r suppose to brighten ur day but wat is happenin seems e exact opposite. LIfe is lyk a pure torture. I may be jokin n laughin but tt may not be i wat im feelin. It is so hard to live a life tryin to live up to ppl's standard. sometimes when u wan to say sth yet u dun get to say it, u'll feel terrible inside.   Anw, today is sports heats. It was rainin b4 tt but aft awhile it wasnt. My frenz n i was runnin 4x400 n it was e laz event. We waited den when it was e 4x100 Relay tt time, it started rainin. Light at first den it started gettin heavier. It was a total waste of time, waitin for e rest n not runnin in e end... lolx. Rylz brought umbrella but she didnt wanna use it. I didnt hv one wif me so we waited for e rain to stop. While waitin, a man chased us out. kinda sad coz we wanted to prac aft e rain stop but i guess its fated tt we cant run. We went tm aft tt... Saw a few sickenin ppl. Argg. Tink its pure shit!!!  * Livin Life e way u wan it, is e bes way as u are the one who is in control of ur own life...*

      Hmm, maybe tt's wat im feelin rite now... Havin mixed feelings. 
   You're depressed. Really you are. And you definitely have a reason. You often space out and stare at things blankly, even if you're normally hyper and energetic. This is because nothing really seems important anymore. You might just be sad right now, or you might be manic depressive. Don't worry. Have some cocoa and stuff'll be ok.

   You're chocolate.  You're the old soul type, people feel that they have known you their entire life.  Many often open up to you for they view you as thoughtful and trustworthy.  Although people trust you, you have a hard time trusting them.  You prefer to keep your feelings bottled up inside, or display them very quietly.  It is alright to open up every once in a while.

   You have a free soul! As all the souls go, yours is the most free-spirited and adventurous. You like camping, hiking, or interaction with other people. Your a social butterfly, but not because of your style, but because of your willingness to communicate with everyone. You probably have close friends who can rely on you because you always seem to know whats going on in the world. You love music and are free-spirited and someone fun to be around. A born leader and great explorer-dont ever change-the world needs more people like you.

      hey, im back. promise not to go on9 de but jus cant help it. Hehe, habit. Oh yar, today sum1 told me tt durin e YJ thingy alot ppl wondered y i side wif her. Haiz. didnt noe tt so many ppl actually gossip abt *erm, erm*. Was really quite shocked. Anw, can c tt many ppl distanced frm both of us. Who cares loh. So wat if all of u tink she's diff? She' not. She's still lyk us, normal n need frens. I jus simply dun understand it... I make e decision I make coz I tink im not wrong. Jus bcoz i not wif e cls doesnt mean ath. Argg, bringin dis up is hurtin... I jus wanna make sure tt my feelins r heard. I cant stand it any longer to keep it inside me. It jus isnt fair for her. She may be in e wrong but nobody wish for tt to happen too, dun they? Imagine if tt person is u, constantly bein avoided, how wud u feel???   The world has changed, changed too much. I wish i could go back to e time when gay= happy. Wont tt be jus great? Oh no, my head hurts... Argg... Sobz. Tml is pw, die le. My Pw file is in a terrible mess n i'm e leader. Guess jus hv to prepare tml morn.   Mr Ling is goin tml. It's so unfair. Y do our cls always hv to deal wif dis kinda of separatin stuff? So many teachers hv come n go. I totally agree wif Kenny... Y does all e gd teachers go n e bad teachers come? Simply cant understand. I tink Mr Ling is so sweet to us. He was willin to be embarressed jus to show tt he cares. Noe wat? He played e guitar n sang two songs jus for us. It's so sad n touchin. Our cls is so damn evil to him yet, he tot so highly of us. 1 mth past so quickly... Hmm, saw my ex-form teacher Mrs Tay. She lk tired, mus be stressed by all her studyin. Almost our whole cls rushed out to c her when we noe tt she was here. We tok for a while. Sadz. Brought back all e fond memories...After a while, she went back. hehe. hmm tt's abt it. cont if i rem ath...

  Firstly, durin e church service when every1 was kneelin down, i was stil lyk seatin n starin at my fren until i realised tt i was supposed to kneel. Den aft tt, i played a game which requires alot of concentration wif my grp members. I usually dun lose much in e game( not say i vv pro lah) but dis time i kept losin... hehe, it was so lame. Anw, e worst part was when i wanted to go to e toilet to wash my hand. i went to tt toilet b4 but tt time (i dunno y too), i jus walked straight into e gents... it was so embarrassin. there was kinda a few guys down dere. lolx. My fren was behind me yet she didnt stop me. haiz, dis is e kinda ppl i hv for fren. sadz. hehe. jk... later, i went to a fren's hse. dere was a paper tt i wasnt suppose to rite on, i knew it but i jus wrote sth on it. haiz, such a terrible day.

      hi... not been on9 for so long. hmmm, abt 5 days aft e camp? e camp rawks. e 1st day, there was e intro n everthing. my leader was huixiu jie n yonghwee ge. they rawks, bond n sring our cls closer. den we had praise n worship. everybody lyk not wilin to jump... hhee. oh yar, im in scotland. hehe, rawks. landers won e bez.  e 2nd day, we had games in sch. there were abt 6 stations. it was so fun. C= haiz, missin camp days. e 3rd day, we played games around e bedok area. hehe, there was free leg massage. so cool rite. den e 4th day was games in sentosa. it was a combination of amazin race, fear factor and sth(cant rem e laz 1). We had campfire n bbq. i ate so much crappy fd. hhee. tink i grow fat le. wahahahaz.
 Durin all e days we had worship time, bible study n quiet time. the most memorable day was e 4th day coz my fren Melissa accepted christ. thnx be to god! C= den tt day everybody was quite enthu durin e games n e worship. our grp ran almost all e time. (if i remember correctly...) Was so happy n touched by e msg. lots of christians rededicated their faith. e laz nite, we were kinda rushin e pillows for our leaders but in e end only Yl stayed up e whole nite to complete it.
  Aft e camp, i tink i c many changes in e ppl around me. Those who appear quiet were actually vv enthu durin e camp. really enjoy myself durin those 5 days. i dunno wat else to say but to thnx god for his greatness, his luv. n oso my leaders, my grp members... w/o all dis ppl, i'm sure student camp'04 wont be as fun. Callin all ppl dun hesitate any longer, mus come nxt yr. I'm sure u wont regret.

      Today was so exciting. I left cls at around 10am, went to hv lunch wif e cds ppl. Aft tt, my frenz n I went to change into drama-t. At around 12, my seniors started performin for e sec3s n 4s. It was quite stupid as e ppl keep on laughin. Later, they acted e whole tink again for e sec1s n 2s. e overall response was quite gd although e sec3s n 4s laugh a lot. 
  Aft e whole tink, I wanted to go n celebrate wif my seniors. In e end, I slackin wif rylz in sch. We watched e softball match n our sch won…(I tink) While watchin e match, I wanted to move to e lower step den I shifted my bag. Guess wat… My bag kinda rolled down e stairs. It rolled in a vv nice manner den my fren n I was laughin. Dere was guy walkin up e stairs n he burst up laughin. So embarrassin when I went to take my bag up. Luckily, it didn’t drop into e drain n oso tt dere were not much ppl dere. 
 Around 6 plus, I went hm. Saw a fren. Dere’s eng test tml n I realised tt I forgot to bring e ‘phrasal verbs’ ws hm. Wonder how I’m gg to study… but I tink tt my fren sent me a copy of it. My maths ws tt was suppose to be hand in tml was oso in sch. Haiz, so unlucky. 
 [Exhausted] feel lyk slpin as I woke up at 4.30am today. Oh yar… news update: We’re gonna hv a new drama-t. Yippee… I’m not sayin e old 1 is ugly but I’m glad tt we’ll hv 2 drama-t. C= I’m so happy…

      Hey ppl, srry for not updating my blog for so long coz I was kinda bz wif sch n cca. Dere was oso lots of hw… Anw, I promise to rite a super long update today, k. Cheerz!
  Hmm, long way back to mon. I was really vv happy n excited to go back to sch as i miss my frens so much.1 f my fren was abit sad to go back to sch. Anw, i was so happy n so enthu tt i even agree to seat at e 1st row. I was supposed to hv cca aft sch but it was cancelled. so sad... Was expectin n wantin to go for cca. I luv cds!!! lolx
 Tues was a lame day coz i started dao-ing all my frens frm my batch. I dunno wat happen too. It is definitely not PMS k. I jus didnt feel gd... Anw, it was a stupid day... Oh yar, i rem tt i was late. I woke up at 6.40 n changed into mysch-u quickly. I went to meet my fren at tamp interchange. We tried to get a cab n we waited so long. In e end, we were late n had to run 5 rounds. I felt so bad aft tt as my fren was oso late coz of me.
 Den wed... it was a funny day. I meet my fren as usual den her fren was wif her. Her fren(my fren too) wanted to take a cab so we walked out of e interchange. Dere were actually 3 sec sch pupils waitin b4 us. when they saw us, they walked to e front. I tink its so ridiculous coz we didnt even intend to "snatch" a cab frm dem. Haiz, we waited so long. Luckily we reached sch in time otherwise hv to run again. Aft tt durin assembly, e praise n worship, i was caught by mrs chan for not tuckin in my shirt. Was so funny as 3 or 4 ppl in front of me didnt tuck in too. I was so 'lucky'. She made me stand outside e hall. So embarrassin... Anw, shikaige n alvin sang a song. It was so nice.
 Later, we had sports heats. 2 of my frens were not feelin well n i had leg cramp. In e end, we still took part in e event. Although we lost, I tink we fought e gd 'fight' as we didnt withdrew frm e competition. Haiz, aft runnin, i got gastric pain. So unlucky. grr. Den, i went wif some 2d pupils to mac. 
 Thurs was ncc day. Our sch celebrated it on fri as it was in conjunction wif st john's day. My frens, seniors were doin e props. Aft a while, we went to discuss abt sth. It was quite serious n i learnt some disappointin news. Most sec1s refuse to cooperate. So saddenin. I can't tink of ath special tt happened on thurs so i'll move on to fri. 
 Fri was cca day. so happy as i get to c my seniors. My senior lost her pouch which was 1 of e props. I was suppose to be responsible for it n my fren n i lked for it. In e end, some1 found it. was so glad otherwise i would hv been dead. I fell down while walkin up e stairs to e backstage. Luckily no1 saw. lolx. Later aft e rehearsin, my fren wanted to go wif e seniors to eat. He was suddenly vv enthu but all of e sec2s wanted to go hm. It was so funny as he was tryin to persuade us to go wif him. Den my 2 frens n i went to a nearby provision shop. We bought tibits n ice-cream. We sat around a table to eat n chat. The ice-cream tt i was eatin had a layer of choc around it. The choc dropped on my skirt. I was laughin so hard n 3 men dere was lkin n laughin too. Was super embarassin. Aft tt, i tried to wash away e stain caused by e choc n cont chattin. dere was a cat nearby n it went to 'lick' my lag. Although i kinda lyk cats, i got a shock of my life. I screamed. it was so horrible n scary. I didnt noe tt e cat would come so near to us. Anw, it licked n ate e choc tt i dropped on e floor. Aft eatin, we went hm. 
  den on sat- today, we went to e sci center. It was so fun. At 1st dere was some lecture we had to attend. Some parts were interestin. Got to learn more abt human n stuff. Den, we went to e ecogarden. Dere was a worksheet tt we had to complete, was interestin tryin to find e anws. e citrus fruits area had alot of big fruitflies, was so terrified by tt sight. For most of e qns, we followed e crowd n got e anw. At around 11 plus, we went into e exhibition hall. dere was so many cool n interestin stuff. Hoped tt we could stay longer as dere was still many tinks tt we had not seen. Den b4 we took e bus back, we went to mac n bought fries. On e bus, was quite borin coz nth much to do except eatin. lolx. Aft reachin sch, abt 11 gals n 3 boys frm my cls went to TM. e gals went to mac to eat together n we were jokin n foolin around. dere were pupils frm 2e n oso guys frm 2h tt we kept on meetin at e exhibition. Oh yar, at e sci center, 2 guys frm 2h was tryin out 1 of e exhibition. den it was abt e coins n u r suppose to drop e coin in n e coin will be donated to e sci center. e guys wanted to try out tt exhibition yet they quickly grab hold of e coin b4 it roll into e hole. so funny... back at mac, a guy had sth at his mouth yet he didnt noe. All of us seatin behind e 2h guys were laughin lyk mad. so stupid. It was vv fun although didnt slack at TM.
