      in inquisitionibus adventis tibi fortuna secunda sit vivite felices... et tibi parta quies  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveller, long I stood And looked down one as far I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;  Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,  And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.  I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I --- I took the one less travelled by, And that has made all the difference.

      I'm Daniel. Having read Vanna' s post I felt it my moral obligation to reassure my ego that my mind hasn't become redundant. Unfortunately there's no alias, pseudonym, and low and behold no AKA in the name Daniel. I'm just not that cool.  Four weeks from now we'll have been through Beijing and have settled into the 'cosy' flat that will embrace us for a year. That is to say we've been updated to the role of teacher, transitioning across the great expanse that is the void between the teacher and the taught. Now weigh yourself down with the slight discomfort of only being able to say hello, ni hao.  For the next three weeks I'll be living where&nbsp;I have been for the majority of my life. Muswell Hill, London. In terms of bags, we're talking the mutts.  Waigouren in Zibo simply refers to the status I will adopt on stepping foot in China. Quite simply, you are different. You are a foreign Devil.  This may be my first and last post, but I'm not generally one for computers.   I hate to see you go, but I'd love to watch you leave&nbsp; - Nick Cage

      Zibo Institute of Foreign Affairs.  My main work is teaching English to college students. All I have to accredit my status is a yellow card which reads  "This card confirms that the carrier is a bona fide PROJECT TRUST VOLUNTEER".  That and my ununique enthusiasm for something different, that selfish desire to feel like you have deserved. I'm not that different from my friend Vanna, but we will come away with two different tales. This is your opening to shimmy to the left :  urlLink http://www.thoughtsfromchina.blogspot.com/  I'm not under the illusion that my going away will benefit anyone more so than it does me, but in the last twenty years more than two hundred and fifty different regions and cities have fallen suddenly open. All the people I've spoken to have opinions that are not far-removed from my own. Would it be insulting of me to believe everything that I hear? Initially I was seized by the foolish idea that each one of them would withhold some secret from me - some simple, perfect illumination. Because that is the foreigner's obsession in China. A billion uncomprehended people. I don't want to fall suspect to the nagging feeling that I can. I don't want to teach for a living, I want to learn. China, teach me.

      Stealing a thought from one of my closest friends  "It's one thing to go away for a couple of months but a whole year is some serious time, especially considering life-changing decisions and events can happen in a fraction of a second." It's wierd how a 'small' statement can bring together things that have shied away from the frontal lobe.  Revalation seems a bit heavy - more an encroaching sense of recognition. Even more daunting are the times  a journey comes to an end. Often your first fledgling steps can appear cumbersome on hindsight, but given the opportunity would you change them? Having reached the end of the path to China my mind is unwilling to take in that there is no longer the adventure of reaching the adventure. This  is  the adventure. It's odd when you saunter back and observe just how institutionalised you can become into the life that you know. When you see that every little habit that you have has evolved from some small niche unbeknownst to you, how can you even tell what will happen when the safety net dissolves.
