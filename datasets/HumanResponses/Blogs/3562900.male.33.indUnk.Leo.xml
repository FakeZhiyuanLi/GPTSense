      This is a nice day to blog.  I'm here in the kitchen and the kids have already left for the babysitters.  I purposely turned the t.v. off and the fish pond.  You see, the pond has a waterfall.  With that on, i feel i always have to go to the bathroom.  It also doesn't help that i drank 3 cups of coffee this morning.  They(the animals) gave me a run for my money yesterday.  "Prince" didn't want to walk yesterday during our morning stroll, so he had to be carried on my shoulders.  In the hot sun, I felt like i was walking through the desert.  "King" kept asking for apple juice, thus Prince aquired the urge as well.  That was the start.  At the video store, after repeated verbal attempts(threats), Prince and the King continued taking the display videos off the shelves.  They did not get spanked- luckily there was other parents with the same dilemma.  This must be normal, i'm thinking.  We get Jamba Juice and while we're waiting for our juices, Prince is trying to take the pictures off the wall.  Again, more verbal "attempts" and he manages to abstain.  Oh yeah, he is getting mature.  I'll probably miss that in those two when they get older, so i should enjoy it now.  In the meantime, they keep me extremely alert.  We end up at BK for lunch.  As soon as we get the food on our table and we are about to eat, King needs to go.  Oh yes, so we leave the food there and we all take a feild trip to the bathroom.  Prince is getting into everything, i'm trying to clean the toilet area for King, and the King is doing the rain dance.  After that fiasco, all of us had to wash our hands!  We eventually ate our burgers and went straight home to take a nap.  Naptime- Daddy's tired.

      Today’s my sister’s birthday and I can’t get a hold of her.  I got a card for her that the boys’ decorated for her.  It’s a little messy, but that’s the boys for you.  It’s also their Ate’s birthday and they decorated that too.  Nicely done I must say.  I have the privilege to stay at the hotel tonight.  I requested an early check-in because of the drama going on at the house.  L took off with S last night to Magic Mountain and her mom did not approve of that.  I don’t know when they’re planning to come back, but I do know I don’t want to be around when they do.  This is one fireworks show I don’t want to see.  Back to the hotel, it’s a lot nicer than the previous one I worked at.  This one is a much upgraded version.  Not only the furnishings, but also the management that works here is much.  They actually work.  They don’t gossip all day on the phone- they work and manage the hotel.  I might stick around here a bit.  Their system and philosophy makes better sense.  Yes, I think this may be nice.

      I walked down the kids this morning with moms as usual.  Kissed them their goodbyes and watched them drive away.  Me and Kuya have these secret hand signals and I don't want to miss it if he throws one my way.  It was early in the morning still and I don't work until 12 noon.  So what do I do?  I barbequed!  7 in the morning, what the heck is this guy doing?  That's what probably all the neighbors were thinking walking outside holding coffee in hand.  I had defrosted some chicken legs and a few chicken halves the night before.  In minutes, the barbeque was all fired up and ready to go.  Like clockwork, halfway through cooking, I started basting those bad boys with Mr. Yoshida's gourmet sauce.  I kept at it every 5 minutes.  Turn.  Baste.  Turn.  Baste.  I love it when the smoky smell of barbeque starts hitting the air.  Oh yeah, they're cooking up now.  The peices are marking up just beautiful and the glazing is just so heavy.  8 o'clock(still morning) now and they're all about done.  Everybody here loves barbeque too so it will probably be tonight's dinner.  As for me, it's time to take a shower and come back down for some serious breakfast.  That's how my Monday started.

      Today was a day of accidents.  I accidently checked someone into a dirty room.  Lisa dropped a plate of barbeque on the floor.  The Lakers lost(huge accident!).  Last, but not least, my son J swallowed a dime in church.  Thus, the title.  It was horrible.  He all of a sudden started gagging in the middle of worship service.  I immediately took him out of there and went to the bathroom to see if he wanted to gag it out.  He tried with tears running down his face- still clutching a handful of coins.  That did not work.  I told him, "no more coins." and threw the coins in the trash.  I got him to drink some water and told him, "it's o.k.,  the coin will just have to come out when you go poo poo."  Poor anak ko.  So, like in my title, dime anyone?

      Today was a relaxing day.  After taking a seemingly 4-hour nap, we took the kids to their favorite- Target.  We were there to buy a barbeque grill since Mom went and bought a(nother) black purse bag for my wife.  Jeez, i thought she had a few already.  Anyways, that would be another blog.  We got the grill, charcoal, t(h)ongs, grill brush- oh and hulk and spiderman underwear, hulk pants, spiderman shirt, etc.  When we got home, i rush- assembled the grill.  After it was all put together, i noticed the wheels do not correspond with the handles on the side.  Meaning, when you pull on either handle, it will not roll.  so i have to take the legs off and shift them one slot over.  What a dork move that was!  It was dark when i finally had it assembled, so i barbequed anyways- wheels offline and everything.  We, or I threw some pork on the grill sprinkled with Mrs. Dash.  20 minutes before it was done, here comes the barbeque/lemon/terriyaki sauce creation.  I know it sounds weird, but let me tell you, in the end, it was fabulous.  with some barbeque sauce on the side, it is very addicting and satisfying.  oh yeah!  My dinner was one good size peice with a lot of rice.  oh, i love that stuff.  I guess that gives it away that i'm asian.  I smell like barbeque.

      Aaaaa, who ate my chicken sandwich?  This hourly thing is really tripping me out(i worked the salary position for almost 7 years my prior job).  It all started yesterday as i was doing laundry, one of the housekeepers took my one and only laundry cart from the laundry room.  she just clocked in, put all the linen on the table, and walked away with the cart.  "Thank you, rookie!" i would imagine she was thinking in spanish.  So today- "hey, who the heck took my sandwich?!"  I hope they enjoyed it.  it was a homemade chicken salad sandwich on white toasted.  i bet it tasted good?  how's my cooking, btw?  I find it so funny to try and gain respect as an hourly.  when i was the man- When I Was Da Man- , the housekeepers made sure i was always fed.  Always.  They always took care of me, they came to me for all their ups(and downs), they always greeted me with a smile, opened doors for me, everything!  Now, I'm on the other side and i'm, I guess, surviving?  I'm starting from the bottom, literally.  I wonder what will happen next.  only one housekeeper has been halfway nice to me.  "C" bought me a soda yesterday, but only because i helped her with laundry.  It's Friday- that explains it.

      I get to wear white socks to work!  For the past 9 years, all my jobs required me to wear black socks.  Now my current employer, with our uniform dress code, it doesn't matter if you wear white or black.  We're offered khaki pants, polo shirts and shoes at a discounted price.  It's very casual.  My first 2 weeks there, I was still going to work in  my black slates, my deer stags, and my black socks.  My bosses were probably thinking I was still trying to "wow" them.  I simply got so used to wearing that- some days I think I dressed better than them.  Wow.  Compared to my previous job, this one actually provided me with the entire wardrobe.  On my last one, they provided you with 2 shirts a year(if that) and you had to purchase everything else.  If that wasn't bad enough, they were very particular of what to wear.  The only acceptable pants were dress khakis or black slacks, white undershirts, all black or all white casual shoes, no polo uniforms in the office, and so on.  What are these people thinking?  Anyways, I'm out of there now and I atually really enjoy what I do for my new employer.  I also get acknowledged for any of my accomplishments- big or small.  That in itself is priceless.  I just talked to one of my ex co-workers and things there are as crappy as ever.  The guests hate the "big" boss there.  One guest called her a bitch- to her face and in front of everyone!  My inside source even tells me she is violating the same company policy that eventually led to myself being let go.  Crrraaappppyyy!  I don't miss that environment at all, but I sure do feel sorry for my buddies over there.  Another guy there, code named, Narc, has also had enough.  He's now changed his code name to "Mule" since the "big" boss has got him doing all kinds of miscellaneous work.  LOL.  At least those 2 crazy indians are making light out of a dreary environment.  I'll have to pay them a visit soon.  Plus, I think they're still holding my mags.  Cheers!

      For my gaming system, that is.  LOL.  I got the game pass from Blockbuster and I find myself going to that damn place every day!  Sometimes I go there twice!  It's like making love.  Anyways, I got so many damn games on my system I don't know what to do with them.  My son, King, likes a couple of games.  My other son, Prince, likes another couple of them.  Lately, my daughter, T-rex, likes only one- Driver 3.  This game can be insanely violent, but she plays it mildly.  As for me, I like all the games, but only play about 5 of them.  Oh, did I mention there is currently over 50 in my collection.  With all the games I have, I still want certain others.  Sudeki is one of them.  I've been waiting all summer for it come out(that sounded young!?).  The character models look hot and it's an RPG(role playing game).  I used to be a huge Final Fantasy fan on another gaming system.  Played VII - IX about 2 to 4 times each!  Mind you, each installment takes forever to complete.  You can spend 2 hours easy just powering up your character in the same desert(all you RPG fans know what I'm talking about).  This sounds boring, but if you ever get into it- it's very addicting.  Long hours go by and I'm kicked off the t.v. by my love!  Now that I think of it, if I get into another RPG, my ass may get kicked- not the t.v!  My love may look sweet, but she can be rough and tough as well.    Back to the games, is it possible to have too many games?  I don't know because I'm fine with having more and more games.  Can I relate myself with the sports superstars who have also extravagent collections?  Yeah, I guess.  Maybe my attention span is so short I have to have a ready selection of games to interest me at all times?  I'm also into getting cheat codes and hints for these games which makes it the more easier to play or complete them.  I see now, I have a short attention span and no patience!  So how did I ever play those RPG's back then?  Oh well!

      Well, it started off nice and easy.  Even when my bosses asked me, "hey buddy, you gonna' be alright?  Need anything before we go?"  No, I'm cool.  All the check-ins tonight fit on one screen- I can handle it(no problem). Was I ever wrong.     At 7p.m., right before sunset, I watered  the flowers outside.  It was all relaxing and happy go lucky, but then the phones started ringing.  I went back inside and started answering calls.  Guests started coming up wanting towels, toilet paper, coffees, movie rentals, etc.  I checked in a guest and the pms we use lost a room in inventory.  The guest was already in the room, but in the computer, it wasn't showing that room to being available.  Damn, this computer IS on PMS!  Shit, so I'm on hold with our beautiful help desk- customer service issues continue to happen.  When I finally get through,  I got an automated secretary asking me what pms we are using, if my hotel is franchise or company owned, if I'm on a touch tone phone, all these ridiculous questions.  What do I do?  Do I press 3 or 6 or what the hell did she ask?  All the while guests are still calling and asking for stuff at the front desk.  OMG, this is not cool!  Of course, in the middle of this, my love calls.  "Hi, honeyyyy.  How are youuuu?" she purrs sofly.  Honey, not right now, I'm in the middle of something.  I"ll call you back.  "Okay, byyyeee".   ))))roar((((  I can't  beleive it.  2 hours later and the rush finally finishes.  Thank goodness.  Time went by very fast during this, but the stress I could have done without.  Thank you blogspot for letting me vent.  I'll be off the next 2 days so I think I can get over it.  Goodnight!

       I'm hoping this is not going to be my only post for July.&nbsp; It's been a busy month, though.&nbsp; So I apologize to all my non-readers that I haven't been updating.&nbsp; I think I'm about settled in to our new place.&nbsp; Doing errands and commuting to work from here has finalized the moving process.&nbsp; I think all the address changes are complete and&nbsp;that should be&nbsp;it.&nbsp; It feels so good to go home at night and just chill.&nbsp; Even if it's just playing Madden on easy mode.&nbsp; ha! ha!&nbsp; All the gamers know what I'm talking about.&nbsp; Imagine Raiders 84, Broncos 7.&nbsp; I still have some closets to rearrange and I think more garbage to toss.&nbsp; Anyone interested in a 20 gal plexi?&nbsp; How about a 7 with pump and lighting?&nbsp; I really want to set up the tanks again, but the place looks so good with very few furnishings.&nbsp; "It's contemporary" as my love would say.&nbsp; When we lived there before, we cluttered the place up.&nbsp; I guess we spent too much time here.&nbsp; Every inch of space had to be filled- even the ceilings(right, hon?!).&nbsp; That was halarious.&nbsp; My love just had to do some interior decorating in our grand family room- so she...&nbsp;&nbsp;    put fabric all around the room- draping from the ceiling.&nbsp;    It was brown.&nbsp;    The futon was brown.&nbsp;    The carpet was brown.&nbsp;    Damn it!, we're brown!&nbsp;    Well, at least I am!&nbsp;    When I'm sitting in the livingroom I feel like I'm immensed in shit!&nbsp;    But it's home.&nbsp; And we're back again and I love it more than ever now.&nbsp; From being away, I've realized how lucky we are to have such a beautiful home.&nbsp; We are truly fortunate.&nbsp; As Prince would say, "I'm yucky!"&nbsp; ha, ha, very funny.&nbsp;

      Although I am an hourly employee here at my new job, I'm treated better here than my previous one.  The stress level is lower, my peers are actually working and not gossiping among other managers, and jobs are not being threatened continuously.  My peers talk to me, rather than being talked down to.  I was talking to my manager yesterday about occupancy and availability.  We talked.  If it were the other job, I would be either blown off or simply cut off and told to go somewhere.  Now to think of it- that was very rude!  A lot of the managers that I worked with or under were rude.  I really like the place I work at now.  The managers treat their employees well and that must be a reflection of their bosses, corporate.  I didn't know corporate could be so reasonable.  What have I been missing out on?  Now I work my 8 hours and I get to relax when I'm not working.  My time is my time.  What a value!  or is that almost a human right?  By the way, Spiderman 2 is tight!  I can't wait to get the video game.
