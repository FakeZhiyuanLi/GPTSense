      I had a pretty solid day today. First I took my spanish exam, bombed it. I mean let's be serious spanish? I don't even speak it how the hell am I supposed to pass a test on it? But then I came home early cause' I had a free period the next exam so I came home and took a power nap on the couch. Next thing I know my sister is waking me up telling me I can have her phone because she's going to get a new one. Well I don't know if you all know the difference between my sister's phone and mine, but it's a big phone. So now I have a new phone and I also bought a few dvds a couple days ago. I got The Simpsons Season 4 (best one) and Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 2. For those of you who aren't familiar with Curb Your Enthusiasm it's the only show that rivals the comedy of Chapelle's Show. I also purchased, "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" it's a good one. But for now I just finished mowing the lawn and I should do Cole diddy's final "preperation" for my final tomorrow. Smoke rocks.

      Good day my children. If you are reading this, you already know, I now have a blog.     Well school is almost over. Dear God, if this school year was moving any slower it'd be going backwards. Turns out I'm not getting straight A's, son-of-a-bitch! The end of school makes me think of Dazed and Confused, the best summer movie in the history of the world. But I just can't wait for school to end so I can fill my summer with sleeping until noon and then going outside and falling asleep by the pool. Sleeping is a skill that most don't take seriously, I can sleep whenever, or whereever I want, jealous? Well I've been ranting the whole time, which is good because I need to get it out every now and then. Well on a side note, the Sox won today, 9-0. Did Derek Lowe win a game? Wow, maybe we can keep this going, and I can't wait for the Pedro-Bonds match up. Well now that I'm an Old Navy employee I can use walkie talkies and not be made fun. Ok, I must be going now, I hope you all enjoyed and come back again, peace.
