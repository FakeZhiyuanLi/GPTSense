      ok, so as we all know.. school started last week... *sigh* and its already getting to be a pain, this week end I had to memorize a monologue  for Drama... and I had some of it memorized before I lost it! so right now I'm freaking out! because I have to have this memorized by tomorrow.. by 4th hour... :s the only two things I can think of right now.. is to try to find it all day (which is what I'll end up doing) or tomorrow.. wait for Henline to get to her classroom in the morning.. and ask for another copy (which will look entirely ... unprofessional) but its the only thing I can do.. well I could always not do it... but that would look worse... and I mean I've had worse, longer monologues to learn... so why is this so stressfull? I think it might be because I'm affraid of letting Henline down.. because I mean I'm a thespian and... it would be right for me to exel in all the things I do in drama related things... so I'm going to tough it.. and try to live out this week... so then theres U.S. history... there is a test on friday.. on memorization of the states.. where they go on the map.. and their capitals.. plus I have to memorize the continents.. and some other things. I'm not entirerly sure if that will be hard.. because I had to do it in grade school, so if I can do it there.. I can most likely do it now.. but its just with all the other drama thats going on.. and all the other stuff I'm having stress on... its making it hard... I don't know what to do..  ok, lets see what else is on my list for stress this week... oh yeah! stupid me! I forgot all about the classes I have to take for the "problem" of stealing signs... and I think its sooo stupid that everyone else got off... that they got to go home without even having their parents called... it pisses me off so much.. and then every expects me to just let up and forgive them!? whatever... don't think I'm going to do that after you sold me out... and lied... ugh!! it makes me mad.. I just want to forget THEM.. the only person I'm NOT mad at is Alicia... I mean some part of me is telling me that I should be angry at her too... but then again, she was in the back seat the whole time.. and she wasnt questioned by the officers.... but Jason and Julie are different... they were being so untruthfull that night.. I mean tney saw me being put in handcuffs and pushed in the backseat of the police car.. and still didnt do anything!? that the fuck is that? thanks alot for leaving me to die.. leaving me for the vultures how can they not see why I'm mad? ugh.... now I'm thinking differently on Julie... me and her.. are really good friends.... we have alot of the same dreams.. and wants.... I want to be her friend but now every time I look at her.. I see... someone who pretty much stabbed me in the back.. (real friends stab you in the front right?)  I dont know if she lied.. about her not seeing who took what.. but she did lie about seeing Naugle and "Waving" to him.. making it impossible for her to see who took what... and I know that Naugle wasnt driving by at that time.. and I know she saw who took what! shes just lieing.... she along as everyone else should take those classes with me.. because they were involved in the theft.. I shouldnt be the only one that has to sacrafice their time... I don't even know if I'm going to have time to do midsummer night... and that makes me mad.. because Alicia and Julie will be able to do it.. but no.. not me, I have to take classes about what I did wrong.. I don't think Julie and I will ever be as close as we were... its sad, discovering who your REAL friends are... I'm just finding out in all the wrong ways.. it hurts..  so anyway on a better note... I went over to Alicia's yesterday, it was so much fun.. and I can't wait for next summer!! its going to be so awesome! we have to do this Alicia.... like I said Imagine two people in a new york city hotel dancing to 80's music... doing "the dance" :P I cant wait.. and we can do the same in London! while were drinking!!! muahahhaha.. then maybe we can do it in italy.. omg, that would be so much fun... *cries* I can't wait... it will be fun, we can't back out! :P well I'm going to go.. search for my monolouge.... bye....

      so right now my computer is just bugging the fuck out of me! its to damn slow... anyway.. I had an eventfull night last night... so we decided to go bowling with Jason.. Kristen.. Naugle and some other girls that Alicia and I called monet paintings... well... just about 4 lanes down were Emily, Lydia, Matt, Britta, and Nick (:s) well... recently Nick has been starting shit with me... and taking things to seriously... its just too much to explain... well.. yesterday he posted a blog that said "I'm going to kick your ass tomorrow" what the hell? hes acting like hes in grade school... and come to find out he supposedly "talked" to my brother.. because he didnt want him to "get in the way of us" thats complete bullshit.. I hate how he fucking lies all the damn time.. it makes me want to shoot him or something... hes so immature, not to mention that he lies all the time... and its sad.. because he just wants to be a part of Emily and Matts "clique" but will never be... I know Julie, and I know... I'm guessing Alicia is beginning to find out. and Nick is the next one.. you just can't be a part of THEM you have to kiss ass for them to give you a little bit of respect... but thats my view on it anyway. During all this time, reading the comments I would just think to myself... you know what... I can't wait till I leave.. and get away from everyone. move away and make someone of my self, and treat them the same way they treat me... like shit. all of this I'm mostly saying is directed towards Emily and Nick... Matt's never really been mean to me... but I'm sure hes talked major shit on me.. and thats ok.. I don't really care.. I do the same.. and I need to stop..  on a lighter subject... school is one day closer... I'm so tired of sitting around having nothing to do... I need something to do... and I need a job, oh and while were on that topic.. I was at the bowling alley (as you know) and Jason and I are talking about Target and how they are hiring. well he comes right out and says "well you MIGHT NOT get it.. because I mean we just hired alot of people" what the hell is that? thanks alot for crushing the only hope I have for getting a job.. could you be more honest!? ughhh! I'm so angry at so many things right now. another thing to add to that list is my dad paided child support.. yay! right? no, it was a whopping 52 dollars... I'm so pissed off... I need a car next year, and I'm not saying that in a greedy way.. I need a way to get back and forth to rehearsals for productions.. and when I get a job, I'll need a way to get back and forth to that... so unless he wants to take me to all these places... he needs to pay. He came over today... and asked me if I wanted to come to "grandma and grandpa's for dinner" I was tempted to say no, but I'm thinking the only reason I want to go over there... so I can confront him and tell him to pay.... ugh.. again.. it makes me mad... I'm going to go for now.. theres nothing to do around here.. I told Julie to call me if she does anything.. but I dont know if she will... bye  nyny

      so yeah school is starting.. in less than a week... I'm a little excited but I dont know... theres always some kind of thing that your thinking of... behind all the good... if that makes sense... like all my classes are cool and good this year (I guess) but I mean you never know whose in those classes so I may know the classes I have.. but it doesnt mean I'll actually like them. like next tri I have a class with Nick Kagy :S god I hate him so much... I mean Julie's in that class too but still :S. I'm a little nervous about the whole freshmen thing too... I mean I know I sound like a complete wimp, I mean why should I be affraid of some freshmen... but I am... its just the girl down the street that will bother me... I dont know if she will or not.. but I'm hopeing that she won't and I pray to god that shes not in my drama class!!!  well listen to me rambling on about my schedule and you dont even know what it is...  FIRST TRI  1. US history a  (I'm not sure who my teacher is right now) 2. not sure yet either.. it says I have Expressives but I need to change that 3. computer applications    Al Kolarik 4. Drama a    Tobie Henline 5. advanced algebra a   Dawn Justice  SECOND TRI  1. no hour 2. again it says I have expressives but I dont know 3. US history b     Phil Anderson 4. Drama b    Tobie Henline 5. English 11a     Patsy Smith  THIRD TRI  1. yearbook production (dont know on this one either) 2.Expressives C (ugh.. same I dont know) 3. English 11b  Patsy Smith 4. open hour 5. Advanced Algebra b    Ron Webber :S  so I really dont know what I'm going to do with all the open hours.. I bet if I didnt go in to talk to the conserler guy I could actually get those hours off... but no.. I'll probably go in and do it anyway beacause I need to find out what I'm doing!!! the big thing that I need to decide on is Expressives or photo Journalism... I'm leaning on the expressives side but god, I dont want that class to suck! and I know it will! she put so many bad singers in that class and its going to make it fall to the ground so much... but all my friends are in that class and its an easy class to take... plus I might have a LITTLE bit of fun... so thats what I'll probably do... well, I need to go.. and think, plus I'm really hungry, later  nyny

        cool isnt it? its a song that I heard in Davids car... (which I love... the car :P and this song) but anyway reason being why I was in his car was because today I was at the DRAMA CLUB booth for inrollment... it was so much fun! I havent seen some of the people in a long time.. including Joley... (which I've found out that I spelled her name wrong in my scrapbook..) Macy.. which I love! shes such a good person.. and some times I feel so stupid around her.. because of some of the things I do.. (tell ya more later) Emma which I havent talked to all summer.. I was kind of iffy on talking to her because she found out about "me" and I've heard that shes not to fond about it.. but me and her clicked just like we've always have... so it was good.. I also saw Kenny there.. which he kind of pissed me off.. because he was behind the booth.... which... I feel that you should'nt be able to if your not a thespian.. thats just my point of view on it.. I mean he could have joined last year.. but chose sports over becoming a thespian... but you know whatever.. I'm still kind of mad about it... and it bothers me because of David.. maybe he wont be such a good president after all... I mean I voted for him but I'm thinking that I should have voted for someone else. After today seeing him and his actions around Kenny were strange... its like hes letting Kenny do all this stuff because he might have a crush on him :-/ and thats a stupid reason... he told Kenny that he could come to freshmen orentation... WHAT? I think that made me mad as well as it did to Julie... he should'nt be able to come, I mean don't get me wrong Kenny is an awesome person... but he should wait just like WE had to wait... I mean I watched all the thespians do all the cool stuff... with out me.. but I just thought.. I'll do that when I'm a thespian... and now that I am a thespian I can do those things.. and I'm so pumped up for next year.. I can't wait for it to get here.... people tell me that it will go by sooo sooo fast.. and I hope it does but I want to cherish every second of it.. and take lost of pictures!! :P (gah I'm such a dork)   so I've found out that I have two classes with Julie first trimester!! I'm so happy we actually have drama A and drama B together... I didnt have to change it after all! :P thats 4th hour... and then we both have 5th hour math.. with Justice... its going to be fun.. well I hope it will be :-/ so I have tons more to talk about but It'll have to wait till tonight... I'm bored right now.. I think my mom just got home, and I want her to take me to get a frappochino. I'm so addicted :P later  nyny

      so, todays monday... it was kind of boring.. yet fun all at the same time. haha it started off with Jason coming over to hang out.. we were going to do... stuff but I wasnt really filling it at the moment.. so we didnt... well then we went to starbucks... ofcourse I would have killed for my vendi cafe vanilla frappachino.. but I didnt have any money, so he just got himself something to drink and something to eat.. he offered to buy me something but I said no... so we just sat there in silence as he ate his food.. and drank his drink.. it was kind of boring....  well anyway after that we then went over to Target because I had to schedual an interview, so we do that and they say.. "well there supposed to do it right after you fill out the application" so I'm like oh god.. I look like shit..... so we do the interview and it takes about an hour.. they asked me all these weird quesitons about being a team leader... and such and what was the biggest acomplishment in the last three years for me.. what the hell? what kind of quesiton is that? well I tried to answer them as best as I could... I guess it was going ok until I left.. I made myself look like a complete dumbass!! I hate myself for it.. well when I walking out the door I said "it was nice to meet you.. my name it Taylor" and pointed to myself (although I dont think she saw me point, thank god!!) but I mean what the FUCK was I thinking!!??? I so hope that doesnt ruin my chances for getting a job there... I really really really really really really need a job, and working there would be so cool... beacuse in a way I've always wanted to work there....  well anyway we came back to my house.. I told him that he could come in if he wanted to but I had to clean my room.. so he would be just sitting there.. and thats what he did... he just sat there and kind of looked over at me every once in a while.. which was kind of irritating.... but I tried to ignore it... so I finally got done cleaning my room like 20 mintues ago.. its so clean, I even cleaned out my dresser, and found a hole bunch of stuff that I had been missing.... its funny when you clean something you actually find stuff you've been missing! how about that! :P well I guess I'm going to go for now.. theres nothing really to talk about.... my mom gets off right now... I hope she lets me use the car.. because I'm sooo hungry.. I havent eaten all day.. plus I would kill for a diet pepsi!! well... not kill... :P but anyway... I'll probably go bye the shaved ice stand and see Julie.... keep her company... blog ya later  nyny

      so I just got this blog and its cool and all, but a part of me still misses Matt's blog site... but I'll get over it.. this site is much more complex and more fit for me anyway....  so tonight was sooo much fun, I laughed so much... I havnent laughed like that in such a long time... but anyway I hung out with Julie and Ashely... Even though Ashley had her leg problem it was still fun, we worked around it... well we started off the night just haning out at her house... for like 2 hours.. and then we decided we wanted salad... lol.. and went to lonestar.. well we had this kick ass waitress who gave us all this free shit... she just simply said.. oh no problem I'll just bring it out.... it was cool, when she left we would crack jokes about it.. I laughed so hard... *sigh* I'm really glad that I have Ashley and Julie as friends.. there so cool.        so anyway the night then got better as we started to drive around until Jason got off... then we met up at smiths market and it was lame.. so we went on to the first national bank.. and got onto to there balconly like thing.. by driving up the parking garage... so about 5 mintues into being up there, we saw Emily and Alicia driving main in her car... so we yelled and they came up... so we talked for a while.. wasnt really a good conversation... and I feel so stupid talking to them in the way I did (in the nice way :S) because I mean I'm still angry at the both of them.. and no matter what people say Emily and Alicia will always be different to me now... and I'm just waiting for Emily to get pissed off at Alicia again, I mean I'm not saying It'll happen but it just might...well I'm getting off into another story.. back to tonight... so it endend up getting busted by some janitor with long hair :P Alicia and Emily bailed like the bitches they are and left us there.... but we didnt get into trouble... well when we left the bank we decided to try to climb the Wiley building.. ahh the wiley building.. brings back memories.. lol of getting caught.. I will always hear the words "Taylor look at this rock I found...." lol well when we got in the alley we had to pull the fire escape ladder down.. we finally got up to the top.. in the process of climbing a shit load of stair... one tall ladder.. two short ones.. and seeing Julies skirt flying up over her head... :P well all of that was so worth it... seeing the view of Hutchinson was so beautiful... and it was worth it because for a split second or two.. I felt like I was in New York city... *sigh* well we finally decided to get down when we heard police sirens lol it scared the shit out of us... so we flew down the stairs like 3 bats out of hell.... it was so cool that it was lightening and thundering.. plus it was sooo windy I felt like I was in a horror movie.. lol well when we got down the the bottom Ashley was still there.... lol I give her alot of credit staying down there alone... because she could climb up with her knee... I felt so bad for leaving her down there... lol it was so scary all the wind was blowing around trash and making the big dumpsters make loud noises by their lids banging around... lol she told us she was just waiting for some drunk serial killer to come out behind a wall...  lol...  but anyway.. tonight was good night... tomorrow Jason is coming over.. and then we will probably hang out with Julie.. I hope shes not getting tired of me :P I also need to go to Target to get an interview.. I pray to GOD that I can get a job there!! I need the money so bad...  Well I'm really tired.. I'll have to type more tomorrow.. I still have so much on my mind that I need to tell... bye for now                                                                                                                                                              nyny
