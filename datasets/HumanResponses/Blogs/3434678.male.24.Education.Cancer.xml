      Using  urlLink Bochs , I got Windows 95 to run on my Mac. Sure brings back the good old days of installing this on a 486. Actually it runs so slow on my 800 MHz G3 that it feels like it's on a 386. Oh well, my plans of it being somewhat useful have been thrown out the window (no pun intended).

      My lease application at Meridian Apartments was cleared today. I'm happy I don't have to live in my office.

      Yesterday, Kenny played drums for  urlLink Annie Lin  at  urlLink Ladyfest  in Austin. Mark, intuitively knowing that this would be an adventure worth experiencing, convinced me to come along. We weren't disappointed.   Just before we left Kenny & Mark's place, a.k.a. the cozy cabin, Kenny receives a call informing him that his sister is engaged. Still reeling from the shock, and after helping a neighbor load a 200 lb. saw into his truck, we proceeded to the Capital City. Upon arriving we were immediately lost, but we bought a map and I used my innate cartography skills to locate our venue,  urlLink The Church of the Friendly Ghost .  After eating dinner in the trolly at The Spaghetti Warehouse, we arrived, simultaneously with Annie, at our destination. As soon as Mark and were about to unload Kenny's drums it started dumping rain in that perfect Texas fashion. We finally got in and after sitting through some blistering acoustic action, Annie's band took the stage.  After the show we again got lost for a while looking for Annie's lodging. After that, at our late night dinner, she decides to stay over at the cozy cabin instead. So we head back to SA, arrive around 5:00 AM and I slept on the floor near the backdoor on four sleeping bags.

      I contacted the manager of Meridian Apartments today. Meridian was one of the apartments I took a look at the other Friday. It's in the same area as Sevilla with about the same size apartments and rent.  There were not to many units left when I visited, but it turns out that there's still an apartment available. Tomorrow I'll send in an application, and a $25 check, and hope for the best.  The computer labs at work were re-carpeted today. Besides being a long day at work, the glue used to hold the carpet down really stunk. At one point I saw a flash of white light and felt very dizzy for a few seconds. Justin didn't take it too well either. The glue has got to be the worst part of this re-carpeting.

      About a week ago a friend and I went up to College Station to do some apartment hunting. The second apartment I looked at, called Sevilla, had the best deal. I would get the first two month's rent cut in half and the deposit and fees were lowered. Also it is close to campus, on a shuttle route, across the street from a park and a church, and close to an HEB and a Target. The reduced rent was a big winner. I've been having worries about finances the first month. Unfortunately they declined my lease application, so it's back to applying at the others.

      I've been accepted into the Mathematics Ph.D. program at  urlLink Texas A & M University . I also applied to  urlLink The University of Texas ,  urlLink The University of North Texas  and  urlLink Rice University . Both UT and Rice didn't accept me. UNT did accept me, but the financial support was lacking. A & M turned out to be the best and easy choice.

      There's nothing like watching  urlLink Steve Jobs give the keynote address at WWDC 2004 . I was having heretical thoughts about my next computer being a Windows PC, but Steve set me strait. That's just what I needed to get my drooping enthusiasm up again. I'm even thinking about doing some development again (seriously.)

      What do I do when my church decides to run the Sunday morning worship service entirely for kids, and has a life size mascot of Rick the Brick singing  Rick Da Brick Rap ? I leave in the middle of church (a first for me), and decide to start attending my friend's church. I was going to stop going as soon as I moved up to College Station, but that service prematurely ended my attendance.

      You might have heard about the  urlLink big muscle German kid . I passed this news along to one of my biology friends and he emailed this back:  But what I don't understand is that even with extra bulk, are all of the extra myoblasts fully functional. And are they innervated correctly. Myostatin regulates myoblast proliferation in embryonic development. In the case of muscular dystrophy, i really don't know how this would be useful since it REGULATES muscle. I don't know.  Biology is not my field, but I whole heartedly share his doubts.

      Ken Jennings has won 16 strait games on  urlLink Jeopardy . My family kept telling me about him, but I'm not usually able to watch Jeopardy. I finally got to watch one today. Ken Jennings is really fast. He was up to $9000 before the other two opponents even scored. I hope he makes it to one million dollars.

      Yesterday the  urlLink first private manned space flight  was flown. It's exciting that in the future space might be accessible. I'd love to go up myself some day. I just hope space travel doesn't stay something only an elite few can do.   The story seems to be getting cool reception in the news though. It's defiantly not the top story. I guess going to space is old hat. Just like the unrest in the 1960's overshadowed the Apollo program, all the unrest today overshadows this accomplishment.

      Fortunately, I don't have huge problems with spam (especially since I stopped using Hotmail), but I have been getting, for a while, email from  urlLink The Fraternal Order of Police District of Columbia . The problem is that I'm not a police officer, I don't live in the District of Columbia, and I never signed up for their mailing list. They also have no way of unsubscribing from their list on their website, and when I email them about it I get blocked by some spam filter (it seems they don't like mail from Yahoo!, and I'm too lazy to try another account).  Well, it's not all bad because sometimes these email are good for a laugh. They're usually about social events at their lodge. One event was a show put on by a ventriloquist. Fun. Lately it seems that there's been a large demand for karaoke, so they're giving in and are booking Pat for this weekend. I can't wait for the email that tells me how that goes. That brings me to the big question: How did I get on their email list? The world may never know.

      I remember that feeling in December when I was a child. December dragged with anticipation of Christmas. The feeling has worn off now and December is just as fast as any month. Usually it's a few days before Christmas that you realize you need to buy some presents. Well that feeling is back, but this time it's August 14, the day that I move up to College Station. ARRGG! The waiting!

      I don't know about you, but it seems that all I get in the mail is credit card offers, lots of credit card offers. Today was a break from the normal. I received a letter from India addressed so:  Professor Christopher Joel Cowan Department of Mathematics University of Texas at San Antonio  My Address   The letter was from the  urlLink Pushpa Publishing House  (warning: their site has about 9 Java applets that serve as link buttons)  and they were inviting me to submit ". . . original research papers and critical survey articles for consideration of possible publication in its established journal namely the  Far East Journal of Mathematical Sciences ." (Just to make it clear, I'm not a professor at UTSA, but I did get a Math BS there.) I thought about sending it back saying that the UTSA math department was not at my address, but I didn't want to lose this letter.

      I was browsing a  urlLink list of mathematics faculty  at Texas A & M. Most of the pictures on the various faculty member's pages are good, but there's a few (for example  urlLink here ,  urlLink here , and  urlLink here ) that look like they were sweating profusely. I hope it's not that hot up there! On second thought though, it might be the lighting and/or the quality of the jpgs. I'll have to ask about that if I ever have one of those professors for a class.

      I got my apartment lease in the mail yesterday. I read it over, which took a while, signed it, and mailed it back today. (That sounds like it would work in the  urlLink the dullest blog in the world .)  On a different note, whenever someone calls me on my cellphone at my house, it makes my computer speakers go nuts with beeping noises. Freaked me out the first time.

      I ate lunch at  urlLink Main Street Pizza & Pasta  with my brother today. I'm going to miss this place. They have the best personal pizzas for the price. My favorite is Green Olives and Sausage. I'm going to miss their sandwiches on Foccacia bread. Oh, and their ranch dressing. As a matter of fact, I think I might make the picture on their website my computer's desktop picture. Well, that might be taking it too far.    I've been going there since I was a student at  urlLink San Antonio College , where one of my friends introduced me to it. I must have spent a small fortune there. I think I've eaten there once a week on average for the last 4 years. Here's hoping there's a good mom and pop resturant to spend a fortune at in College Station.

      Just for the sake of being geeky, I installed  urlLink Yellow Dog Linux  on my iBook. I finally got it up an running, so I hit the icon for Mozilla and nothing. No Mozilla. No web browser. I swear I installed it. No problem, I'll just find the software installer and add it. Oh, where is the software installer program? So I spend 20 minutes or so trying to just get a web browser installed. That made me want to go back to my nice, safe  urlLink OS X . Linux is gone from my life (for now.) I know, that's not a really great basis for judging a system. I'm sure Yellow Dog is a good Linux distro, but I can't be seperated from my beloved OS X.  Linux is good for a lot of things. Servers, scientific computing, and programming come to mind. It's good at web browsing, email, and chat too. It's when it gets to the media side of desktop computing that it's lacking. OS X (and, ugh, Windows) are better for the "digital lifestyle."

      My car insurance payments will be going down 23% because of my move to College Station. I guess it's because of the small city, but it could also be all those fabled crazy drivers in San Antonio. It's too often that you're stuck behind someone going 50 MPH, but the guy (or girl) behind you wants to go 85 MPH.  Hopefully I won't be needing a car for much in College Station. By my crude approximations on a map my apartment is about a mile from where I need  urlLink to   urlLink be . I plan to walk, bike, or take the shuttle. It's partly to get away from driving, and partly to shed some pounds by walking or biking two miles every day.

      This past Saturday, while going to a friend's house, I ran over a piece of metal that pierced one of my car's tires. The metal piece is about four inches long and a quarter inch thick. Nice way to make that good Saturday feeling go away. At least I got that out of the way for my move up to College Station.
