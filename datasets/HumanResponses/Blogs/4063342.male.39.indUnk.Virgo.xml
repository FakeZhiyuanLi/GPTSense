      Okay, a break from theoretical mumbo jumbo.&nbsp; Here's what the 2004 Presidential Election looks like to me:   States in order of support for Kerry:   Lock for Kerry&nbsp;(168 Electoral College Votes):&nbsp; D.C., Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Illinois, California, Vermont, Delaware, New Jersey   Kerry's and not worth contesting&nbsp;(38 Electoral College Vote; running total for Kerry, 206): &nbsp;Washington, Michigan, Minnesota   In Play&nbsp;(140 Electoral College Votes): &nbsp;Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Oregon, Maine, Wisconsin, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, Florida, Missouri, Ohio, Arkansas, Virginia   Bush's and not worth contesting (74 Electoral College Votes):&nbsp; West Virginia, Colorado, Tennessee, Louisiana, North Carolina, Arizona   Lock for Bush&nbsp;(13 Electoral College Votes; running total for Bush, 192):&nbsp; Georgia, Kentucky, Alabama, Indiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, Kansas, South Dakota, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Alaska, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah   Each candidate should target about 290-300 ECVs; that way, they can afford to lose even a 20 ECV state and still make the 270 needed for victory.&nbsp; Kerry, to my thinking, should try to solidify and maintain current advantages he has in states down to New Hampshire, and should go for Florida and Ohio beyond that.&nbsp; Missouri and Arkansas are states to try for if opportunities arise; if Clinton makes himself available, he might be used to try to turn Arkansas.&nbsp; Florida would normally be the ripest target, but there is probably going to be an awful lot of ugliness down there, and best if the election doesn't turn on it.   Bush should target from Wisconsin on down, and at this point he really needs Florida.   Right now the ECV election looks incredibly close, with Kerry taking Wisconsin, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada,&nbsp;and Missouri; and Bush taking Florida, Ohio, and Arkansas.&nbsp; This gives Kerry a 280-258 victory, but 27 ECVs that look like Kerry will get them have only a 1% poll margin in his favor.&nbsp; In particular, Missouri, which I rate as a weak spot for a New England Democrat, momentarily gives Kerry a 1% lead.&nbsp; If Missouri went to Bush, but the results were otherwise as I have shown, this would give 269-269 and a Bush re-election decided by the Republican dominated House of Representatives.   It is very likely that events between today and the election could create several nation-wide swings in excess of 5%,&nbsp;any of which would be more than enough to turn the election.

      This post is about political organization.   In America since very shortly after its inception, the political system has been characterized by having two major parties.&nbsp; Early on, particular parties occasionally collapsed and were replaced, and even since the current arrangement of Republicans and Democrats took hold in the late 19th century, the positions of the parties on various matters have on occasion&nbsp;switched.&nbsp; But always the strong tendency has been toward two major parties, opposing each other on several of the political issues of the day.   This is actually a natural consequence of a political system in which a single set of universally applicable&nbsp;laws and their execution&nbsp;are decided by a democratic process.&nbsp; In essence, it is a matter of individual power maximization:&nbsp; any individual should want to collaborate with as small and homogenous a group as possible while still achieving, and this will always point to a very strongly contested middle, with each side endeavoring to compromise just enough to satisfy a majority and no more.&nbsp; The same pattern can be observed in almost any democracy; in a parliamentary system, coalitions of parties may serve the function that single parties serve in America.   And so, while political parties are often criticized for lacking principles, it is really very natural that they would lack principles, or at least that their principles should be extremely malleable.&nbsp; A political party set in its principles will ultimately either find itself thoroughly rejected or thoroughly accepted, and in the latter case the important political struggle will be between various factions of the formerly unified party.   I provide this comment by way of setting a background understanding for discussion of the current election cycle.

      July 28, 2004   Marsden/King Residence  DLO Andover, Hampshire  United Kingdom   I have spent the last three years, beginning July 6, 2001, living off of an inefficiency I discovered in the financial markets.&nbsp; Happily for the world's economy, that inefficiency has played itself out (at least momentarily), and so --&nbsp;sadly for me -- I must contemplate a return to a more reputable manner of earning a living.   But not so very soon, and in the meantime it is my thought to give expression to my opinions&nbsp;that (if we are honest with ourselves) may not be so freely given while in the employ of another person or of a corporation or organization.&nbsp; Hence the words&nbsp;that you now read.   I will endeavor to make what I write here entertaining, and hopefully thought-provoking.&nbsp; My subjects will certainly include politics, and perhaps I will from time to time comment on conditions and events in financial markets.&nbsp; About the latter, please be aware that my opinions have no guarantee of being worth even what you paid for them.   I have been a compulsive participant in various internet discussion forums over the last several years; most recently the forums at  urlLink Wilmott.com .&nbsp; Such forums seem to ebb and flow, or at least my interest in&nbsp;particular forums&nbsp;has done so.&nbsp; Wilmott remains a very good resource for those unfortunate enough to be interested in quantitative finance, but its general discussion has taken a beating recently.   The name of this blog, and the URL for it, come from the Ancient Greek story of the Trojan War, in which the Trojan priest to Apollo --&nbsp;Laocoön&nbsp;-- hurled a spear at the wooden horse left as a "gift" by the Greeks, declaring, "I do not trust Greeks, even when they bear gifts."&nbsp; I think this gives an apt assessment of my attitude toward most things.&nbsp; (Laocoön, for his correct skepticism, was immediately killed along with all of his sons by serpents sent by the sea god Poseiden; there are several statues&nbsp;across Europe of this event, but not nearly enough in America.)

      Quite a bit, I think, of what we "know" about the world is really gleaned indirectly from sources that we consider credible.  However, the manner by which we decide that different sources are worthy of our respect is often suspect:  we simply do not have time to research what they are about and what their track records are, and so we simply buy into believing things based upon how similar they are to things that we believe in for more direct reasons.  Very much like how ducks are drawn in by decoys, really.  Anyway, this is to be an examination of various means by which credibility is manufactured without being earned.  One clever way to manufacture credibility is to attach a name to it -- "The Coase Theorem" sounds a lot more impressive than "The Theory of the Irrelevance of Property Rights to Optimal Resource Allocation," for example.  A very good example of this is "The Laffer Curve," which economist Arthur Laffer famously scribbled on a napkin in explaining to a politician how high tax rates can strangle the economy and thus decrease tax revenues.  Among economists and probably among most non-politicians who give it the least amount of thought, this is pretty obvious, and I suspect that Mr. Laffer was somewhat embarassed, professionally, at becoming known primarily for "discovering" this effect.  But no matter -- "The Laffer Curve" it became, and its "discoverer," who I believe was previously most known for being a mildly successful and undeniably Republican economist, became the darling of the supply-siders, and his reputation was suitably inflated.  I have from time to time encouraged people to use "The Marsden Function" when describing simple arithmetic to create a similar effect -- "Well, the Marsden Function of current net assets and expected net income indicates that our position next year will be ..."  In writing, it could be further pumped up with things like, "The Marsden function of 5 and 3 -- hereafter M(5,3) -- is, of course, 8.  From this, we can determine ..."  Another way to manufacture credibility is with institutions.  There are, of course, real institutions, like universities, that probably do (in most cases; Bob Jones University being an obvious exception) deserve our respect.  But there has also recently been a proliferation of "think tanks" -- always with impressive names.  The earliest of these probably were genuine efforts at impartial policy analysis; the Brookings Institute, for example.  But they have drifted.  The Cato Institute, for example, is always grinding the same ax, and being pretty straight forward about it other than that their name does not suggest that they are the knuckle dragging libertarians that they are.  But then there are the Hoover and Manhattan Institutes, the latter of which in particular seems to be designed as a way to let someone named William Robert say something without having to introduce it as, "Well, Billy Bob says ..."  (The Bob Jones University is at least honest in this regard ...)  Typically, I am more interested in imitation than in condemnation, and so I have in the works the Brookeville Institute for the Thoughtful Examination of the Modern Era, or "BITE ME," for short.  Stay tuned for my ... er ... our commentary, coming soon.  And a final way of manufacturing credibility -- the most expensive way -- is by creating pseudo-mainstream news media outlets.  Examples of these are the Washington Times (a Reverend Moon controlled enterprise), The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (Richard Mellon Scaife), and Fox News (Rupert Murdoch).  These are the most insidious, I think:  the exaggerated names, the institutes -- these target mostly people who fancy themselves experts to one degree or another.  Pseudo-mainstream media, on the other hand, targets laymen, and that is the antithesis of professionalism.

      Okay.  So democracies tend naturally toward a two-party system, and lasting parties -- like the Democrats and the Republicans in the United States -- are naturally unprincipled.  This would seem to indicate that any individual should just cast his lot for purely utilitarian reasons, siding with whichever party will do best by him and whatever his values are.  In a broad sense, I think this really is true.  But this is in a very broad sense.  While political parties will naturally align themselves with whatever constellation of positions will provide them with a bare majority, some of the positions thus held can be very enduring, and indeed there is likely an essential kernal to all of a party's positions that led to it being identified as a distinct party in the first place.  The modern Democratic Party in America got its start with Andrew Jackson, and it is a party of populism.  This has been, I think, its consistent trait throughout its existence, though in practice it may have exhibited this trait more or less definitively at different times.  The modern Republican Party might be said to be consistently anti-populist, although this can mean very different things at different times.  The Republican Party, I think, is more prone to support over-arching laws as opposed to momentarily popular positions.  This is a consistent trait in its attractiveness to religious fundamentalists; to "libertarians' and "strict interpretationists;" to the economically advantaged; and, in a way, to militarists.  I don't think the Democratic Party can be said to have any sort of long-term support for laws as opposed to populism, except possibly for a law of ever expanding populism.  Most people can probably conceive of laws that they think would serve their society better than populism; the rub is in deciding whose conception of such laws ought to be imposed upon everyone else.  In my thinking about finance, I have concluded that an aspect of risk aversion that is not captured by utility theory is an individual's tendency to believe that the information he has at hand is sufficient for solidifying and enacting his plans:  some people will make investments as though the analysts' projections that they have are divine writ; others -- even at the same level of sophistication and sensitivity of utility to wealth -- will set aside funds to address the possibility that the analysts are completely wrong.  I think that the Republican Party is much more attractive to people of the prior type.  For matters concerning only the individual, this way of thinking is purely a matter of what might be called risk preference.  When actions or positions affect others, however, this way of thinking tends to require a degree of coercive force.  To my thinking, a society is most free when it relies on the least coercive force to function.  While populism can reach horrible levels of use of coercive force in victimization of minorities -- Nazi-ism, for example, was really a populist movement -- generally populism will minimize corecion, and particularly when biases unrelated to matters at hand are severely limited.  While a lot of the particular positions endorsed by the Republican Party today are positions I disagree with -- religious intrusion into government; extreme laissez-faire capitalism; unilateral military activism -- I also generally think that the populist bent of the Democratic Party is generally a better underlying philosophy than insistence on enforcing unchanging laws.  Sparta, in Ancient Greece, was governed by unchanging laws, while Athens was a largely populist society.  Sparta was at most times more stable and powerful than Athens, but Athens was in most respects more free, and Athens created the greater lasting impression on the world.  There are instances in which I think populism should be opposed most ruthlessly, but most of the time it should be embraced.  For this reason -- in spite of many of its transient positions that I think are either wrong or silly -- I am a true-believer in the Democratic Party.
