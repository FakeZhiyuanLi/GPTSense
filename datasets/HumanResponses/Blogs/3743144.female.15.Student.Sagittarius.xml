      wow...it's been three months exactly today since we've been broken up and u think I would be over u...but i'm not... I was a bit colser to getting over u, but as soon as I think I many lose u more than I already have...especially to my best friend - the one I'm most jealous of cuz she had the best of u...my feelings for u begin to show their true colors and the tears begin to fall harder than before, hurting me more than they ever have I know u don't feel the same about me and u probably never will so why won't these feelings for u disappear?? I want them to leave me more than ever so I can finally go on with my life...so I can finally be happy w/out u or any guy making me feel that way...cuz it seems I'm only happy if I'm with the guy I may be in love with...and I don't want that b/c it hurts so much afterwards...  so why couldn't u just take her bak? why did u have to appeal to my heart? why did u have to feel the same about me as I did u? why did u have to be so great to me? cuz if none of this happened I'd be able live my life w/out shedding a tear in my heart whenever I think of you... omg...i'm just like you...which hurts more b/c it show that we could've been perfect for eachother....so let me ask u one more thing.... why couldn't u love me like u loved her?

       you had know idea how good u had it...and now u do...but ur jepordizing everything over this....how cud u throw it away like that and expect to get it bak? I would've given anything to have wut u had w/him and u juss...killed wut u guys had...and now b/c of that I'm hurt more than ever b/c I was stupid enough to pick up ur scraps...I was stupid enough to believe I could've had wut u had, but no...u ruined any chances of that ever happening cuz u ruined him you have no idea wut ur irresponsible actions do to others around u b/c ur hurting them more than u think...ur hurting me more than u think...and u said u wud never do that to me cuz I was ur best friend but I guess ur word doesn't count for anything b/c I'm through holding it to ur last breath...I'm through thinking you'll keep ur promises...I'm through hoping u'll change cuz it's not going to happen...u'll never change cuz this is how u've always been and this is how u'll remain... it's clear to me now that I've put too much into this and I've wasted all my time caring about it this much cuz none of it is working; I'm not helping u in any way. My words are worthless to ur actions...so now everything u do is worthless to me b/c I'm sick of trying to help u...I'm sick of hoping u'll listen cuz my words don't even get thru to u...just continue screwing up your life more than it already is...I mean u've done a good enough job without anybody's help already haven't u? do u have any idea wut u've done now?

      wow, I actually had a life today...went to renitas for a bit of non-boredomness...and actually had fun cuz there wasn't a flock of babies attacking us....it was great tho...we talked about  him , had a laugh, and giggles like a couple of crazy loons (ie. a lot)  but I have to say it was a good day cuz we had tons of fun and I finally saw EUROTRIP! That movie is hilarious in a non-sick-American Wedding way...except for the twins making out...altough there weren't really sister and bro, it's juss the idea of it...*cringe-twitch-twitch* oh and I also got some time to spend with...erm...my crush, if that's wut u call it...but yea, it was a marvy time and i may soon enough be in  looove heaven  *wink*  and I have to say he reminds me sooooo much of Cooper from Eurotrip...haha...except  not as  stupid....hahahahahahahaha....I'll juss laugh to myself about that movie cuz it was hilarious and continue laughing about how much cooper reminds me of him....*laughs hysterically for a long annoying time* ok done....But u know wut I think wud be great is being a roomate with that hot of a guy...*sigh*...scott  but let me ask u this...WHICH IS WORSE:being chased by scary fat naked men, watching their junk flap around  or  being behind all the men seeing their bum-oleys shake about?

      *hmmm...* I started re-reading the book -Knocked out ny my nunga-nungas-, which is...A LAUGH, and I read the definition of the term nunga-nungas...which is a girl's breasty business if you couldn't figure it out...but anyhow...it says that they can be called that b/c if u get hold of a girl's breast and pull it up and then let go-- it goes  nunga-nunga-nunga ....and to my observation...it does!
