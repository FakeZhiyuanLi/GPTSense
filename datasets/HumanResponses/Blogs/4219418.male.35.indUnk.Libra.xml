      Have you read Blogspot's Terms Of Service (TOS)  yet?  You haven't? Well, you should.   urlLink They're right here!   Mainly, as far as I'm concerned, there's only one main part of it I want to make sure you know right now.  Blogspot says they are not responsible for any part of the content of this blog. This is true ... I am solely responsible for it. It's all mine (except for the parts contributed by helpful folks who have something positive to say about my ramblings.)  It's all mine, I say! Nyah-ha-ha!  er ... ahem ... well, anyway, what this all means is this. If you like what I put in this column, let me know or contribute to it in some way. If you don't like it, it's not Blogspot's fault, it's mine. It's not under their control, it's under mine. And if you don't like the content of this blog, don't complain to me ...  urlLink just go here and tell someone who cares!

      I had a dream last night. I was 10 or 15 years older than I am today. I was staying in a small, privately owned hotel or bed-and-breakfast. I know this because the room was decorated as if it was somebody's home, but it had room service. And what service it was!!!  There was a knock on my door and I called out "Come in!" The door opened and a gorgeous 30-ish woman with a trim but curvy figure and fiery, auburn hair came in. She was wearing all white ...shoes with 3 inch heels and matching stockings, a blouse unbuttoned enough to show a little cleavage and thin enough that I could see the hint of a well-filled, white lace bra underneath and a white skirt short enough to tease me into thinking something more might be glimpsed. Little did I know ...  She said, "I have your dinner, Mr. Longer."  I said "Great ... bring it in."  She rolled a cart in and busied herself with the task of laying my meal out on the table. While she did so, I continued to let my eyes linger over that beautiful face with those lucsious, red lips; then they drifted down to enjoy the full swell of her semi-hidden breasts; and then further down to gaze in wonder and curiousity at the generous fullness of her hips and the sway of that skirt ... and it left me wondering what treasures might be glimpsed underneath it all.  As she was finishing up, I decided to take a chance. I said, "You know, it's been a while since a woman as lovely and as sexy as you paid this much attention to me."  She looked at me and then seemed to look me over again, taking her time. She said, "I find that hard to believe ... a guy as good looking as you probably gets plenty of attention."  Then she turned and started rolling the cart back towards the door. I spoke up and said "No, really ... it hasn't been like that ... I mean, it's just really been a while ..." and I trailed off.  She looked over her shoulder at me, cocked her head and seemed to think about that for a second. Then she smiled and bent away from me. Reaching behind her lovely behind, she lifted up her skirt. Then she took one hand and slid the cloth of her panties to one side and gave me a glipse of heaven. She said, "Well, if it's been too long since you've seen this, take a good, long look ."  I gazed in wonder at the most amazing pussy I have ever seen. It was perfect ... delicate redish pink petals, slighly swolen and curling away from a darker, (moist?) slit. I was stunned hypnotized paralyzed and thrilled .... lusting for more and dreading the thought that she was going to go away in a moment. And finally, with thoughts of lust and love and passion and spark and electricity and vigorous thrusting and sultry kissing and thunder cradled, I decided to try being clever.  So I said, "Can I get that heated up later?"  And (glory of glories!) she said, "Do you want it now?"  And I said, "Yes, ... oh YES!"  Then she locked the door, turned and started walking toward me, unbuttoning her blouse as she came toward me ....  And that's when I woke up ... very ready for sex! LOL!
