      Ryan Seacrest is a bitch. His daytime talk show is like a cross between Oprah and TRL. He meddles in the private business of Hollywood stars, and has all the "TRL" girl crazy music artists on his show. If his show isnt for 13 year old "Look ma! my first vaginal bleed!" girls,then I don't know what is.  Anyway this week he decided to lash out at colleague Simon Cowell, stating that the "Insult wars" you see on American Idol are real and that Simon is Arrogant,and "Says things that are at times a bit too harsh"  Ok dumbass, when you're in the business of showbusiness you gotta be able to take constructive criticism. If you want to be "America's Singer" then you need to learn that if America does not like you,you're gonna get Booed. Ryan Seacrest is the real "American Idol" winner, He should thank his lucky stars that Simon Cowell exists, because...  no simon = no Am Idol ratings No Am Idol ratings = Nobody sees Ryan Seacrest No Ryan Seacrest exposure = No "Live on Air with Ryan Seacrest"  So this week's God of Dumbasses goes to Ryan Seacrest.   urlLink MSN Entertainment - News - 'American Idol' Host Slams Cowell

      This Week on "60 Minutes" Bill Clinton will discuss the Impeachment, Kosovo, and Infidelity. He calls his ordeal with Monica a "Terrible Moral Ordeal" This interview is a pre-set of his new autobiography "My Life."  I don't know about you guys,but I thought Clinton was a decent president he had some rough times there at the end, but I tried to look past that. Now He wants America to re-live it all, First by writing a book, then flaunting on TV about how "Wrong" he was.  Look,Bill, We know you were wrong, We all have got a bad case of Testosterone and boned the fat chick. but we dont go writing books about it and showing up on TV whining about it 5 years after the fact.  So To Bill Clinton trying to get some publicity and book sales, I say DUMBEST IDEA EVAR   urlLink CBS News | Clinton Proud Of Impeachment Fight | June 16, 2004ï¿½22:06:07

      If you guys ever come up to sites like the 2 below,please dont get sucked in. It's just people's attempt to make more money off of the internet.  "The click and wait RPG" is one that gives you "X" amount of "Turns" per realtime hour,however if you pay them,you can have MORE turns,need an extra turn and can't pay em? ADVERTISE for them.  Now you've done their advertising and gave them money so you can "Attack" another player,now you must wait another hour to attack someone.  And btw,THIS ISNT A VIDEO GAME. it's just text on the screen.  I know these sites arent new,but they are this week's DUMB INTERNET TRENDS.   http://www.idlepimps.com/ http://everwars.com/

      Paris Hilton and Nicole Richey was on Fox last night in "Simple Life 2" season premere. This show was quite disturbing in the fact that two of the richest broads in America are begging for money. Not only are they begging, but it shows average people like you and I handing over 5 dollar bill after 5 dollar bill. Nicdole even offered a gas station clerk to work FOR 30 SECONDS for free stuff. This week's Dumb People IRL goes to Average Americans Who come in Contact with Nicole and Paris.
