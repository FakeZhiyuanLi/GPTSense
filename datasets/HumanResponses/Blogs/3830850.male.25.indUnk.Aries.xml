      It was a stinker today so I decided to pop down to the Ishikawa Prefectural Museum of Art. Very small but featured a National Treasure. Also, a travelling exhibition started a few days ago entitled "Picasso, Matisse et peintres du XXè siècle: Fauvisme et Cubisme". Now this exhibition is listed on the Picasso website, but it doesn't mention a stop in Kanazawa. Nor does the Museum of Art mention this exhibition in their website (the previous and next exhibitions are there). The permanent exhibition itself only costs 350 yen. The special exhibition plus permanent exhibition together works out to be about 1200 yen. I asked the lady how many Picasso pieces were in the special exhibition. She answered 100. I thought she was crazy...That must be the total pieces in the special exhibition. I bought the ticket for both.   The permanent exhibition was OK. No photographs allowed sorry. The Kutani-ware bored me to tears. There were a few nice paintings from Japanese artists (nothing old). The National Treasure was a cock pheasant shaped incense burner. It had a nice long tail. Couldn't really appreciate it. There were a few nice sculptures and a few other things. No swords, kimonos, calligraphy, scrolls, old paintings, screens, etc. The freakin security guards were also snoring. Imagine hiring 60-70 year old guards who are so tired that there are already asleep by 1:30pm. I woke one up deliberately by coughing...there was a tremendous echo. HEHE. They started following me around after that.    Finally, finished with the permanent display and decided to look at the special exhibition. There were lots of expensive Picasso prints (30,000 yen) for sale at the entrance to the exhibition. There were three galleries (7-9). Went into the first one - no Picasso's. About 20-25 paintings most of which seemed to come from one gallery in Germany. Went into the second gallery - 4 Picasso's. Went into the last gallery - no Picasso's. I figured at this point that I must have missed something and doubled back. Nope...only FOUR Picasso's in this Picasso exhibition! About 30 pieces from Matisse. Confirmed there were only 4 pieces from the ticket collector at the special exhibition. Not happy at this point. Went back to the ticket/information counter but the lady I initially spoke to had disappeared. Asked to speak to someone and they got me this man to speak to. I told him that I was sorely disappointed by the exhibition. He said it doesn't belong to the gallery. He asked me to "teach" him what happened and my address. I wrote down my complaint on a piece of paper and demanded a refund from the organisers. He promised that the newspaper company (organisers) would get back to me.   Let's see what happens.

      Well, it's been a fun week. Only got attacked by two people. Nothing serious luckily.    First incident - Velvet:  Sitting in APRE (gaijin bar) on a Thursday night (15th July - AKA payday) talking to Krud (Irish snowboard fanatic) when Velvet, being drunk, decided to sit next to me and spouted abuse of some sort. Can't quote the whole exchange verbatim but it went along the lines of...  Velvet - "you don't know shit" and "you don't know what this shit is".   To which I retorted "that lump of shit appears to be you".   This was countered by an oldie but a goodie?!? "well you must be looking in a mirror".   At this point I almost pissed my pants...obviously you can tell he is a witty fella.  I had to counter with "nope that lump of shit is definately you."    Well, wouldn't you know it...Velvet took offence and decided to do what a good American does when they lose in an exchange...he picked up a lighter from the table and decided to light it under my forearm. Now, I'm not a hairy guy but there was definately a light burn and hairs did singe. I quickly turned and pushed him away. He decided to hit me back. This was probably a bad move on his part. I then brought him to the ground and held him with my left arm while my right arm was in the air really to punch (very K1/UFC like). By then everyone had turned around to see Velvet cowering.     THERE WAS NO PUNCH.     He apologised...many many times...too many times. I told him it's cool. He said "water under the bridge" but I prefer "water over the dam". When I left I said goodbye to which he responded with goodbye and two very calculated, attempted playful, light but slightly painful punches to the chest. This was directed between my man breasts...straight onto the breastbone (sternum?).    Second incident - Moon Face:  Very tired this morning. One day off work (out of three) so far for this month. Getting on the train and Moon Face (no not Bert Newton) was standing by the door as he usually does. Moon Face probably goes to a "special" High School. He's a little freaky coz he stares at women and starts smirking, picks his nose and wipes it on glass partitions, listens to music and attempts to sing and dance. Now, I don't really do anything to Moon Face and he leaves me alone. However, he must have watched Spider-man 2 or something yesterday because he was feeling particularly tough. He tried to block me from entering his door. I went towards his left and he didn't leave me any room so I moved towards his right and entered. I must have brushed him a little but didn't apologise (nobody does in Japan). I walked about halfway down the carriage when suddenly I was attacked from behind. I thought someone had taken a strike at my left leg with an umbrella. Everyone was staring. Moon Face was running back to his door. "What an audacious attack" I though and left him alone.    I stood near the other door, under the aircon, leaning next to the door. The train wasn't due to depart for another few minutes. Moon face decided to walk out of the train towards my door to attempt to stare me down. The only reason I noticed was because suddenly all the women on this side of the carriage looked uncomfortable. I turned to stare back. I tried very hard to hold back my smile...How can you not smile when a Moon Faced boy is trying to glare at you. He eventually got bored and decided to go back to sentry duties. A minute later another man went in Moon Face's door and was attacked.

      Sorting through photos tonight. What to junk and what to print. Also looking at what options I have for PHP photo albums.   Had a haircut today from a pretty cute hairdresser. Was pretty pissed off when they told me that prices went up by 530 yen! From what I could understand, that price rise applies only to men! "That's discrimination" I thought...only females should have to pay more for haircuts. Anyways, coz this woman wanted to speak English to me, she kept making these tiny tiny adjustments in order to keep chatting. My longest haircut in Japan is now 70 minutes. Yes, it's a little too short.  There was a cricket/piss up on Sunday at the local park. We used umbrellas for stumps and a cricket bat fashioned from what appeared to be a plank of wood with a makeshift handle and tape. Nearly every Nova teacher from Kanazawa turned up. Probably 30 or so people. Things were going great until an old man who works at the park told us that sports/games were not allowed. We said sorry and when he pissed off, we kept playing. But the old fart came back later and sat on his Mama Cherry watching us. A quick argument ensued. Didn't really give a shit coz I was gonna go and watch Spider-man 2 at ルネス (Renaiss) with Kayo. Cheers to Sam Raimi for the slapstick in Spider-man 2 and also giving us old fans some Evil Dead inspired shots.

      Well, well, well... The nameserver was set and has finally propagated to the DNS.  Hokkaidocrew.com is the brainchild of three fools who met in Kanazawa, Japan. The said fools consist of Winston (me), Peter and Sarah.  -=-=-=-  There was a Brit and two Aussies who worked for a Mc Language School in Japan. They decided to climb Mt Fuji in October 2003. Now, Fuji is generally no difficult task (during Summer), but when there's knee deep snow and ice... Anyway, the same guys decided to go to Hokkaido in April 2004 to snowboard. Now, Hokkaido usually has world class snow (during Winter), but when only two resorts are still open you know there's trouble.   One day, one Aussie decided that he wanted to get back to reality and return home. During his going away party and in the whole emotional/drunken state, the geek of the group (me), thought "hey we can make a website and keep in touch that way". "What the hell is wrong with email?", I can hear you saying... Well, as I said, I was in an emotional state; I had to use an iMac in a bar to check my email. Now to answer your next question. Writing in a stupid 3rd person narrative is difficult and I'm tired!  -=-=-=-  Currently, there is no content on this site except this blog. I haven't even made email accounts yet.    Picture of me at Shirotoko National Park, Hokkaido
