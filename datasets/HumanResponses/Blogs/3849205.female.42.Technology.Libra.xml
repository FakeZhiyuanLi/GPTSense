      173--Well I got on the scale this morning. After two days I was hoping it would be around 170. Oh well. I will be drinking lots of water today. Its supposed to be over 100 outside today. I think I will live in the pool.

      Not sure on the weight.....It is a really hot day here today and it will be for the next few days. I had some scrambled eggs with some shrimp for breakfast and water so far today. I think there is going to be lots of water. Its supposed to be over 100 for the next 3 days.   I think I will prolly have a salad for lunch and one for dinner. Im not used to that much salad, but I know its good for me. I am going to have to get some more tomatoes and shrimp.   I just really want to post some feelings Im having....Im afraid...I feel like if I dont get rid of this weight I am going to die. I am so inactive and that just has to change. I am trying to work outside more and make herbal beds which is active. I am really going to work on this issue. Im also afraid of failing. There is no denying it...I love sweets and I love carbs. I will sit and eat when I am not even hungry. I have to come to terms with this too. It all has to end. I want to eat when I am hungry and eat things that are good for me.&nbsp;   Its now 10:30pm and I so want to eat. I have made up my mind though that I am just not going to eat after 7pm. I also got a very large water mug tonight that I think holds like half a gallon. I will drink two of those a day.

      175--Greetings my friends. This is day one of 14 days of Phase one of my new way of living.&nbsp; I began this day with some scrambled eggs and then had a big shrimp salad for lunch.

I hope you will follow me on this journey of getting healthy and if you have any comments feel free to email me. My email is  urlLink treespirit@verizon.net .

      170--Well going down again. I dont want this weigh to go down fast...I want it to stay down.&nbsp; I really dont want to go camping this weekend. If I get treated like crap I will come home...its just that simple. On the good side, I have lots of good food packed and should be able to eat right.

      171--I couldnt believe it when I got on the scale this morning. I had back what I lost yesterday. think it is just water retention because it is so damn hot here again. I know I ate right. Im not drinking enough water. I didnt work on wood yesterday like the day before either.   I can only do my best.   It has been a good day today. I had a nice shrimp salad and some low carb icecream. I need to be eating more meat, which I am going to work on.  I will be going camping for a few days so I wont be writing Friday, Saturday or Sunday.&nbsp; I have planned ahead for this and tonight went shopping for food. I got tuna for some tuna salad. Im going to boil some eggs, taking chicken and steak and some large shrimp. I am also taking salad.

       169 -- Well things are not great at home, but I have been down this path before, but I am not letting it break my determonation of being successful. My weight  IS  going down.   I dont think I have mentioned two people that are going to be joining me here at the end of my phase one. They are two friends that are more dear to me than either one will ever know. They have agreed to be my support. At the end of my two weeks I am adding them and they will be allowed to read this and add posts.   The first one is Dave. I met him online in an online game about 6 years ago. It seems like a lifetime. Over the years we have shared and talked about just about everything. Two years ago I even traveled to Vermont (clear across the country) to his wedding. I trust him. I also trust him to tell me the truth. If I am screwing up he will tell me. If I am doing well he will tell me that too.   The second is Debbee. I met her online also. I met Debbee about 3 years ago. We became good friends. This last January, we took a trip together to Thailand and had a great time. Support works both ways. Friendship works both ways. She too will tell me if she thinks I am doing good or bad and I cant wait till she can move here and live with my family and I.  My plan for the day is to drink lots of water, have salads and some chicken and perhaps a steak and some low carb icecream.

      171--I am pleased that I am starting to go down. Im sure it would be much better had I not pigged out at the casino the other night but that is life.&nbsp; I am not going to be a slave to this. It is my way of eating. I cant remember if I mentioned it before but a few days ago I bought a really large drinking mug. It holds like half a gallon. I really love it. Ice stays in it all day. Im still not drinking as much as I hoped but I am drinking much more than I was.   I have been working outside and enjoying it.&nbsp; Today I plan on starting on the wood.&nbsp;

      173--Well I am off to just a peachy start. To catch up, day before yesterday was a good day till evening. I had eaten and been drinking lots of water. Then my daughter called and asked if I wanted to go to the coast and have dinner...I wasnt hungry in the least but I thought it would be fun so I said sure.   It turned out that we instead went to the casino for dinner. Keeping in mind I wasnt even hungry I had a compleat dinner. I was so stuffed. It was so good. I could have even just ate things legal on phase one but no I went totally off it.   Rather that beat myself up over what happen, yesterday I just started again. I was so full from the day before and due to the heat all I had was water and a small bowl of low carb ice cream.   This brings me up to today. It is supposed to be cooler. Today I had a shrimp salad for lunch. I later had two small chicken breasts with mushrooms and olives for dinner. I also had a small amount of low carb ice cream.&nbsp; I think I did well.

      169--Worked on a lot of wood this morning, and I am really sore.  I went shopping and got a couple of dresses to perform weddings in. One is a nice brown one and the other one is black for the Pagan weddings. I will try to get some pics and put them in here somewhere.  The wedding is next Saturday that I am performing. I got the ceremony done today. I think it will be quite nice.

      169--I woke up to the good news of a lost pound only to have the bad news of one of my favorite cats had been killed out on the road.  So its a sad day for me. I went to the store yesterday and got food. Picked up apples which I can have now and asparagus which I have learned to like. I also got some no fat milk and might start eating oatmeal. If I could lose a lb a week that would be great. But a nice slow loss is ok.

      170--Well if I really stretch it, it might be 169.5.  Im not feeling really great this morning. It might be the flu or something. I just dont feel like doing anything. For lunch I am having a turkey wrap which is pretty good.  I hope I feel better tomorrow so I can get outside again

      170--Well I am not giving up, but obviously something is not right here. I am going to be drinking more water and cutting down a bit on all the salads I  have been eating. Im not losing a thing.  Tomorrow is my last day of phase 1. I will be starting phase 2. I have to read up a bit on that. I am going to the store tonight so the timeing works out well.. I worked on wood last night so got some exercise in. I am going to start walking too.

      170--Well I am back from my camping adventure. I was good proud of myself. I didnt eat anything I shouldnt have. And NO drinking. I came home thinking I would be a couple of pounds lighter .... and nothing. I drank so much water...It was hot enough to fry eggs. This is just so hard. I only have two more days of phase 1. I see no point in staying with it after my time is up. I will just move on to phase 2 and lose slowly.

      I didnt weigh myself this morning and it looks like I missed yesterdays posting.  I have made some decisions about this weight loss issue...I am not going to buy anymore weight loss items...that means no more diet pop, no more low carb stuff, no more anything that has aspertame or splenda in it.  I am going to eat low carb, which means meat and lots of salads but no special foods...I really feel that it is detrimental to losing weight.   It is so hot here today and will be the next few days...I dont even feel like eating. Lots of water...I feel so motivated.  I have to get in and get some pics taken so I will have 170 lb pics.  Then I can look forward to the 160 pics and then 150 and then 140 and then 130.
