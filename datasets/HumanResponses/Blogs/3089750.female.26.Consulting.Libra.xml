      I don't make new year resolutions. Goal-setting is a very good thing and an important part of planned success. You need to be a pro-active person to set goals for yourself, work on them and achieve them.  And since pro-active persons can do all that, pro-active and smart people know that they don't have to wait for the new year to set goals for themselves. Any day is the first day of the rest of our lives. Any day is good enough to set goals, to start a new program.  Sure... its a reference marker. Treat it as such.   A new year doesn't make you change. It doesn't modify your basic characteristics. "I'll do this and this and this in the new year." Yeah... like the new year is coming out with open arms and doing the thing for you. Open your eyes... you are going to do whatever it is that has to be done. So do yourself a favor and don't wait till the "new year"... get a head start... do what you have to do... right away!  If you want to change yourself... now's the time to do it. forget procrastination. Though ya know... work smart... set weekly goals too. and schedule follow-up checks while you're at it. Any one can make resolutions. You gotta implement 'em. If you don't check the status... you're not gonna get anywhere.   Tsk... two more minutes and I'm gonna sound like Tom Hanks in  Castaway . Do I have years of solitude written in my fate? errr... introspection will do you good.... try it.

      Kabhi Kabhi mere dil mein khayaal aata hai Ki zindagi tere zulfon ke naram chaaon mein guzarne paati  To shadaan ho bhi sakti thi  Yeh ranj-o-gham ki syahi jo dil pe chhayi hai teri nazar ke shuaon mein kho bhi sakti thi Magar yeh ho na saka...  Magar yeh ho na saka Aur ab yeh aalam hai Ke tu nahin....  Tera gham, tera justju bhi nahin  Guzar rahi hai kuch is tarah zindagi jaise Ise kisi ki sahaare ki aarzoo nahin Na koi raah na manzil na roshni ka suraakh Bhatak rahi hai andhere mein zindagi meri Inhi andheron mein reh jaaoonga kabhi kho kar  Main jaanta hun mere humnafaz Magar yunhi ... Kabhi kabhi mere dil mein khayaal aata hai...

       Strange foreign beauty I'll never know what's in your heart Does anyone know how it feels to hold you Does anyone know the secret of your mind..   This song was one of the (numerous) love ballads of the band called Michael Learns to Rock (MLTR). Does anyone remember them? The corniest part was, they brought out one album - I think it was called  Played on Pepper  - and WHOA - their next album was  MLTR - Greatest Hits ! Which contained all the songs of their ---yes, FIRST album!   But anyways, this album came out way back, when I was in school - and some of their songs - Paint my love, That's why (you go away), Sleeping Child, 25 Minutes etc., were big hits back then. The band was Swedish and the lead singer was this blonde hunk called....lemme think now...yes, Jascha Richter. And there was Soren and Mikkel on the guitar, and the cute drummer whose name I don't remember anymore :-(  And they also had another song that was, like, the absolute favourite of guys who were jilted in love - it went something like -   I'm not an actor I'm not a star, and I don't even have a new car... But I'm hoping so much you'll stay, that you will love me anyway.."  Corny huh? The first line sounds like something out of my adolescent attempts at poetry.   The other Swedish band that was really 'in' those days was Ace of Base.   Hmm, laterz...

       You may be familiar with that "yada, yada, yada" thing, but it's clear you just can't commit every Thursday night. You'll definitely watch the last episode, but--let's be honest--only because it's the thing to do.   *gasp* I'm a so-so Seinfeldian!!!!! I got 7 quiz questions right out of 14! This is outright shameful!!!   You take take the quiz  urlLink here .   But but these questions were really hard... i AM a Seinfeldian *pleading face*  I... I... I even have Seinfeld's poster on my wall at home. Oh forget that! I have have several lurid fantasies that involve  Jerry Seinfeld, myself, and lots of latex. How many women have done that about a stand-up comedian?  So.. I mean... I like Seinfeld... don't i?

      I bought a ceramic cup made by colleagues of the company I used to work with earlier. Some of them did their major in Arts and all that and so were into pottery, ceramics, stained glass etc. They held a minor exhibition and they called me.  Every now and then they have their ceramic sale in the old office building. Everytime I go through them but never buy anything. Once, I talked with a girl selling that stuff for a long while but didn't buy anything. At that point, S had said that I should have bought something since I was talking so much and looking so interested.  So, day before yesterday I knew it was being held... and I thought I'd take a look at it before going back home. I went around to see if anybody had a big mug that I could buy. They always have all sorts of things from cups, glasses, bowls, to fabulous (and expensive) decoration items.  So, I was at this table and lifted a mug upside down to see if there was a price tag. The guy behind the table said "Everything on the table is 50 bucks."   "oh okay :-) Now i can ACTUALLY buy your clay," I thought.  So... well... I started talking with him about the pottery. I always talk about these things at the sales. Like how long it takes to make them etc.  So, I see this glass with two deep hole like things.... finger marks actually... really deep... I said to him "Hahaha... this was a mistake right?"   He said "Actually that was intentional." Ahem. Okay. Must remember not to open my big mouth and shove my flat foot into it.   Anyways... so we are looking at all the different stuff... and I'm pointing out stuff which I think was done by mistake.... and we're laughing and stuff. So... I got the cup... glass... er... mug... tsk... glass... well... whatever... with the two deep finger marks in it. :-) Its really cool actually... finger holes at the right location... easier to grab the thing :-)

      Make ANY sense, to ANY one, ANY of this??  RJ (11:44:37 AM): i'm not going to give you lectures on how you should get over it or what mistakes you committed RJ (11:44:58 AM): i know you're smart enough to know all that (or else we wouldnt be friends for so long ) ME (11:45:09 AM): i mean - the things i did - sometimes now I wonder WHAT THE FUCK WAS I THINKING RJ (11:45:16 AM): yeah  RJ (11:45:28 AM): it has happened to me ME (11:45:38 AM):  RJ (11:45:45 AM): i was close to moving back to india for an online relationship once, before sense dawned! ME (11:46:08 AM): yes Priya..i remember RJ (11:46:10 AM): but then at times i think... RJ (11:46:21 AM): do i really regret whatever happened? ME (11:46:38 AM): no - i dont RJ (11:46:50 AM): my answer is: no RJ (11:46:50 AM): it was good while it lasted RJ (11:46:50 AM): which has been the case with all my relationships ME (11:46:50 AM): see - it is because of all my experiences that I am what I am today,  RJ (11:47:05 AM): and if it was good, the natural thing was to continue and try to take it to the logical end ME (11:47:07 AM): i am what I am because welL....of the things and the people that happened to me ME (11:47:16 AM): and have i turned out any worse for it?

      The other day I was talking to another online acquaintance who was telling me that he was in love with somebody online... and they were discussing marriage. Heh... I always used to ridicule people for that. Though now... well... I still think just online interaction doesn't tell you everything about a person.   GET REAL! I'll still maintain that. Online interaction is one (pretty huge though) step in knowing a person... not the end all.  Anyway, I've been through it, and it didn't work out, and I've always wanted to talk about it. I do have pages and pages on it in my mind - I just never could put it online where I knew people could be reading it.    Looking back... what went right... what went wrong? Not sure... lots of things were right, lots were wrong... and lots were just quick.   Anyways... so in the end some would say it wasn't "meant to be."  But I don't believe in the supernatural meant-to-be  situations. It's your active choice. Not really even a passive one. You make your choices. Be courageous enough to admit your choice... and accept the other's choice... instead of leaving it to supernatural design.  Some would say that I should try to find that romantic side or that I better change this cynical attitude while some could say that a loss in love has left me bitter..... I don't really think so. The weird thing is that I can remain objective even if I'm involved emotionally... as if there are different parts handling different events... whatever.  But I guess I'll talk more of the whole love thing now and then.

      Here is what Ranjith has to say about me. What fun!   Long Weekends    In one sense, all my weekends are long. I wait endlessly for Monday in India, for my friend Reshma, of whom I'm an unabashed fan, to write something new about the world, as she sees it, on her blog, of which I'm an even unabasheder fanner.  Read his blog. It's dead brilliant.

      I have an online friend... really good one... it's his birthday tomorrow. I'll obviously send him an e-card. But it just doesn't seem enough. What else can you do from a distance?   Actually I wouldn't really mind sending a real physical tangible gift... but I've never asked for his address. Not to mention his parents would freak out on getting a gift from somebody from the net. Plus I don't want to send a wrong message. We've known each other online for just over three years now. We used to talk a lot earlier... but now its a lot less.   So... like I was saying... there's just not much to do. An e-card... that's about it. Also... I don't want to do anything which can be misinterpreted as romantic interest. There's no romantic interest. None at all.  Hmm... *shrugs*

       CAN WE JUST BE FRIENDS?   Now that's a true one, eh? I was reading some love and relationships column on MSN... and one article mentioned it as '5 words that can strike terror' hehe.   oh yes... I read love and relationship columns. Not regularly... but every now and then. they're different kinds of columns. Some are good while others are amusing.   GQ has those columns too. They're kinda okay. Though often than not the questions they choose to publish are stupid. "Oh how can I make my [wife/girlfriend] do [this and this kinky hardcore thing and stuff that I saw in this video]".   Yeah whatever.  there's specific kinds of columns. There's a type which is how-to-get-girls columns. Then there is i'm-in-a-fix-what-do-I-do type. Then there are advice columns.  Anyway... I'm kinda bored. I'm out. But I won't really be out. I'll be in. I just won't be in in.

      "It is necessary for the protection of the essential security interests of the United States to limit competition for prime contracts of these procurements to companies from the US, Iraq, coalition partners and force contributing nations" - Paul Wolfowitz  What gobbledygook is this? How do you go and tie competition and security interests?   But there's more:   "Limiting competition for prime contracts will encourage the expansion of international co-operation in Iraq and future efforts"  ohhh... economic arm twisting?   This is disgraceful. But it does make sense. You will only get the spoils of war if you join the war. But of course that also implies that that's how they are treating this grand selfless rebuilding of iraq... as spoils of war.   But this is wonderful, people. Pick a country. Attack it. Say it'll be rebuilt. And you are the one who's going to decide who does it. Then take the contracts yourself.  Voila capitalism. Err... crony capitalism. Not to mention the harm it does to the image of US. Didn't they keep repeating how they wanted to spread democracy, free iraqis, yadda yadda yadda. They're over there protecting oil fields instead of people, want others to take policing work but will remain militarily, and take lucrative contracts for themselves.   Now you have chosen that it'll be rebuilt, you have taken the decision of who'll build it, you have chosen yourself to build it. And then they'll make those other people pay for what they didn't have any input in.   How dare anybody think there was any other motive other than altruism.

      In the past week or two, I've read a number of books on writing, fiction, novels, etc. It's something I keep going back and  doing. That's usually my approach to things - pick up a book and try to get as much information as possible. Now some people would think that that's unnatural. Restricts creativity. And Shakespeare never had to read a book on how fiction works. Actually, I'm a believer in the synthesis of knowledge. I think knowledge can be broken down, written, and transmitted. I think the physicist-philosopher Michael Polanyi also said that same thing. I think he argued that you can create a data bank of how any activity is performed. I mean... sure... there can be questions as to whether a book can teach to play the flute. Or if a cook book can teach how to cook. But then cook books don't really tend to be for teaching cooking. They are intended to teach you how to cook a particular dish. See the difference. It's just a difference of specifics vs. generics.  Anyway, so as I've been running through those books, they've deconstructed novels, characters, action sequences, view  point, etc. etc. They say when you write a book, you ought to know what genre it will fit in because you need to sell it, and the publishers publish by genre and bookstores stock by them. It's length should be somewhat standard because that's what the public expects and that's what dictates how many can fit on a shelf. Practical business decisions totally  unrelated to writing but that have effect on the business of publishing.  Of course, nobody argues with success. If you break every rule in the book and still manage to be successful, then you're  called great. Otherwise, you're an idiot. Like they say, there's a fine line between genius and insanity. But anyway, come back to breaking down writing... I find it fascinating. I find breaking up of such things very interesting because i just love to see the subcomponents that combine to form the whole which is obviously greater than the sum of the parts.   For instance, I always find dissection of love very interesting. Harmones being released, blood circulation speeding,  palipatations, etc. Mix 'em up and you have "love." Someone once remarked to me that what fun it could be when you  consider love in that form. I dunno... I just find deconstructing things pretty interesting.

      I read  Burnt Bread and Chutney: The Memoirs of an Indian Jewish girl  in two days flat. 260 pages... zoom... finished.  The jacket of the book listed that Carmit Delman had lived in Ohio, New York and Israel. I was like... so that entitles her to write a book? Then I could write one, consisting of my combined experiences of three Indian cities! But then I remembered, I don't have a glamorous sob story which makes books worthwhile to read. I mean... talking in a business sense. A compelling biography needs a sob story and a victory that acts as the balance ultimately delivering satisfaction to the reader (as is for classical music).   Anyway... I really loved reading it but I had some problems with it:  1) It seems anachronistic: it seems the story kept jumping time. One moment she's talking about Dirty Dancing then she's talking about a socialist kibutz in Israel where the family had to work the soil. Err... 50s, 80s... where are we?  2) G-d: The whole book is littered with "God" written as "G-d." For all of the concerns of "taking the lord's name in vain," I think it's finding loopholes and really decieving G-d.   Questions: Do you refer to God when you write G-d? Do you think "God" when you write "G-d"? Do you want others to read "God" when you write "G-d"? Do you want others to think of God when you write "G'd"?  Yes, yes, yes, yes! Then what's the point of writing "G-d"? You're leaving out a single 'o' for god's sake!  To me that's just as stupid as topless models on the ramp in a fashion show who cover their nipples with a couple of fingers. I know they're nipples. You know they're nipples. I know what they look like. You know what they look like. You're not wearing anything. So what' the point in covering a square inch of your body?  It's really going after comfort of mind... thinking you're doing or not doing something when in reality you're doing just the opposite. Tsk, tsk.... people!  3) I don't get the title. I get chutney but I don't get burnt bread. I thought that they'd be some reference about burnt breat to judaism in the book but there wasn't. They're was however a time when she and her grandmother had burnt rotis (english: bread) and chutney... but that doesn't then conflict.   *** Apart from that it was quite good. She was from an indian jewish community. Her mother moved to Israel. She married an Eastern European Jewish American. They moved to America. Then they moved to Israel. After disillusionment they moved back to America. Introduce identity crisis: They're not "real" americans. They're not "real" jews. They're not real "jewish-americans" who expect them to be rich and white; they're not either of those. She doesn't want to be indian because her grandmother was in an abusive relationship in India. They're shunned by every group because they are mixed in all respects. But her grandmother doesn't want her to let go of the community (jewish, american, indian). So she sticks with the community... jewish, indian-jewish, american (she did want to be american) even though they've never really accepted her. End of story.  I liked it. Interesting read.

      I have to wonder about it. What is the purpose of my/our existence?   I'm told God did all this. But what for? Why? To what end? (Yes, I know. But I do know counting, I can assure you).  And here's another question still - To what end, bubba? What's the plan? What's the idea behind all this?  Suppose, just suppose, I take a dozen fish and build them a big aquarium. I keep looking at how they live in the aquarium. Then at the end of the year, I say, okay, these ones have been good, and these ones bad. And I take the bad ones out of the water. And fry them and eat them or whatever. Project finished?   Now people will ask: And what the hell did you accomplish? What was this meant for? You did nothing. You played with these fishes' lives. Didn't you have anything better to do? A empty mind is the devil's workshop! What did you you gain... except maybe an egotistical satisfaction that you are in power and the pleasure of imposing your power on these poor fishes!!!?????  *Silence*  Is that, then, our answer? I don't know. I'm just tossing ideas around. Otherwise... what's the point of all this? It would be really fun if somebody could speculate on the purpose of the god-created world. Any takers? Entertainment? Egoism? What!?  And if you'll excuse me, I have lightning bolts to dodge. Can't stick around in one area too long ;-)

       I am in a VERY bad mood today. I'm fuming. Just touch me and I'll blow up.    This morning one of the taps in the kitchen stopped working. So the maid came in and began droning in my ears while I was trying to concentrate on outlining my Cupid's bow with red lipper. So at one point, when she was just beginning to do the tango on my last nerve of patience (* Didi, office jaane se pehle nal theek karwa do na *), I called my landlord and asked him to send a plumber over. Not my fault that, he has this standing offer of If-anything-goes-wrong-do-not-hesitate-to-call-me. And I did.   So, the SOB tells me that he is busy these days (wonder with what, he is an official in the Delhi Government Horticultural Department; I have an impression he clips creepers for a living), and cannot send a plumber. Additionally, he tells me that it's been three months (yes, MONTHS) that he had raised the rent and should actually be paying him more.   To which I pointed out:  1) It's been three months since I last agreed to the increased rent and there was NO reason for him to raise it again.  2) Not like I was getting any extra benefits in the flat, I mean, not like he installed a faux water fountain in the living room, so what was the hike all about again !!??!! (Ok so I did not tell him this example, but you know what I mean)  3) As a conclusion, I told him that I was not going to agree to any hike in the house rent for the next one year -  Jo karna hai kar lo!   So he said...Ok, we'll see if we can come to any arrangement. And I was like...Yes, arrangement all right, around your bloomin' neck! (yes, I know, I didn't manage to say THAT either)  When Sharad & I were still together, he used to tell me a proverb often to illustrate what a vulnerable life I was leading - it went something like ... " Banjar zameen aur akeli ladki - khaali padi rahein to kauwwa bhi chonch maarti hai. "  (Fallow land and a single woman are the same - even the crows come and peck on them).  Though at that time I criticized him for being sexist etc., I'm beginning to think there is some truth to this.

      Recently, Microsoft announced that they had found a couple of Swastika symbols in one of their Office fonts and that they would issue patches to remove them. Hmm... for some reason, it seems to me that I've seen Swastika symbols in fonts before too... I thought they were standard or something. Weird.  It's probably a business decision - not to piss off people and trigger boycotts and bad PR. Microsoft is doing it voluntarily -I don't think a lawsuit to force Microsoft would survive legally. Europe (France and Germany) has a record of limiting Nazi memorabilia (artefacts, if memorabilia doesn't sound appropriate) and related speech. However, that fierce action is not seen on the other side of the Atlantic, which often results in situations like Yahoo allowing sale of Nazi material in the US but not in France. So it's interesting to see that it's not the european segment of Microsoft that has initiated this action.  Anyhow, this seems to have an uncanny 1984-ish resemblance. It's a classic case of newspeak. If you think from a linguistic point of view, letters and symbols form the basis of our ideas and thoughts. Letter, or fonts in computer lingo, allow us to construct words that constitute speech. At the heart of newspeak was the concept that if you limit the letters or symbols available to people, their capacity to think and express that thought would also be limited. Thus, you could eliminate dissent by merely erasing offensive words from the dictionary. Over time, the words would slip out of usage (in fact, it would be vigorously enforced) and people wouldn't be using the words.  And so taking out the swastikas from the set of symbols available seems to fit perfectly to this concept of newspeak. Let us just remove the symbol available, it would limit the ability of people to use it to cause offense.   Of course, what was lacking in the conceptualization behind  newspeak was the consideration that thought and speech are different things. The fact that you can readily force people not to use some words cannot restrict their ability to think of them. And surely enough, not having swastika symbols available doesn't cleanse people of having thoughts of Nazism. For that matter, people could still use Office to construct the swastika symbol using shapes. Surely they wouldn't next include an algorithm to detect the shape and prevent it from being designed?  On a different level, the restriction of the symbol also seems out of step with reality in that Hitler or the Nazis did not create the symbol. They used it for a mere 25 years, if that, out of the nearly five thousand years it has been in existence - used primiarly in religion - spanning vast geographical areas from Byzantium to Mesopotamia to India. The swastika symbol is still used by Hindus in India in a way that has no remote linkage to anything in europe. In fact, the symbol in Office was derived from Japanese fonts - a further assestation that it was there as a cultural symbol. I think people on both sides of the usage are largely unaware of the symbol's other meaning to the other side.  That is a point that ought to be recognized. When the meaning of a thing is quite offensive to somebody else that is what it is to them. I realize that then you don't want to not only not restrict but also gift to the ability to easily create material of hurtful nature. But then that also falls into our newspeak concept - for it is not the usage that's being restricted, it is the very existence of the character. Secondly, if somebody goes and hijacks somebody else's symbols for some time, how long is it before the original holders can use their symbol again?  Also, it is interesting to question if hammers and sickles get the boot too.

      The other day I was talking to AD ... and I said to him that women could really rulers of the world. Why aren't they? Don't we realize their potential? All the power that we have?  Why... we can have all the men walking on their knees all over the earth! We just never try I guess.   Once a girl asked a friend of mine to pay for storing her jacket in the closet at a disco. A stranger... didn't know her. What does he do? He pays. what else?  I asked him... why... ? why did you pay for her jacket? And he was like, "It was just a 10 bucks ... she asked me to... I don't care.' I was like... nope... She could have made you do anything. Anything. You would have done it like a dog. Hehe... really think you paid out of choice? ;-)  Women weild this amazing power over men... they can make them do just about anything!!! They just need to say it. But... they just don't ask! ... or i mean... flutter the eyelashes ;-)  Hence... they can really develop into the master sex if they so wish and organize.  Most of the early 20th century philosophers and social thinkers will tell you that there are two classes in the human race... names will vary: elite & masses; Rulers & Ruled; Oppressors & oppressed; Aristocrats & Slaves.... guess what... there is the possiblity of another categorization of classes: Women & Men.

       How can u just leave me standing? Alone in a world that's so cold? Maybe I'm just 2 demanding Maybe I'm just like my father 2 bold Maybe you're just like my mother She's never satisfied  Why do we scream at each other This is what it sounds like When doves cry.   One of the few songs (apart from  Purple Rain ) that I like from the music of Prince/T.A.F.K.A.P./The Symbol. Remember this song, anyone? :-)

      Right now I had a conversation that is making me think about things. The way most of us will wait for things to happen … and will live in that belief.   So there’s this guy who said his parents had recently celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary and had gone to Egypt, to see the pyramids and had done a Nile cruise. And the conversation veered towards travel and tourism and he said he had never visited the Taj Mahal. I acted my usual shocked  How-can-you-not-visit-the-Taj  self and recommended a trip immediately.   To which he said that he was waiting for the ONE TRUE LOVE of his life and until he found her, he would not see it. He also said, and I quote, " Its like the beauty of the whole place...will be like a blow to the solar plexus, making me acutely aware that I haven’t found true love...So I want to go there with somebody who I am in love with, and who loves me.. ."  *sigh*  I remember the first time I had seen the Taj. It was with a colleague/friend and his cousin brother on a bleak February morning. We’d tanked his Maruti Zen and had gone over for a day. There have been several trips since. None of them have been even vaguely romantic. Funny thing is, I did not wait for the ONE TRUE LOVE (still undiscovered) of my life to take me there. If I did, I’d possibly be waiting still :-)  In three years from now, I will make the Nile trip, all by myself :-)

      I was sitting in the library computer section... and to the side there was this girl sitting. I could only see her eyes with the monitor hiding everything else.   And I took a little time and I was looking at the eyes. My my! What eyes!!!!! They were deep! Its too cliched... but you could drown in them.  Funny thing was I could only see the forehead and the eyes... so... I just looked at the eyes. And there was this shining aura; this dark depth - not glamorous... but just very beautiful.  So, I got up and started to leave... and had to go by where she was sitting... and then only did I see her face. And not to be rude.... but... the face didn't do justice to the eyes! I wouldn't really say that she was beautiful... but... those eyes!  So you can see it two ways.... everybody has something or the other to their credit.... or... its the law of averages acting. You have one thing good... and other things not so good. averages out.

      I told a friend once that we had to ensure that a button wasn't too far to click... and she thought I was exaggerating. Studying Software design concepts (and interface design) is really interesting.  We have guidelines. The average user will wait no more than 7.5 seconds for a page to load. They won't stay for it unless it is something they really need. Colors, Fonts, sizes, icons, redundancy, duplication... all those small things which nobody notices.  We had our web design class today. Our regular prof was down with flu... another faculty came to cover the class. As she turned away, this guy next to me lip synched "I hate this b*tch." Everybody hates her. Though, personally I haven't had a class with her. She went and switched off somebody's monitor today (Doesn't want anyone touching computers while she's talking).  Anyways... so we were going over information architecture. And organization. The average user want to reach the desired information in 3 1/2 clicks. You need more, and they'll go off to another "easier" site.   Users like Broad & Shallow sites instead of Narrow & Deep. Meaning that more links on the page... and less in the hierarchy.... as against only a couple of links on the page (categories)... and a lot of stuff under the categories.  She claimed that people can look up any of their favorite pages... they'll be full of links. Err... I don't think Orkut qualifies :-)  Later.....

      Anyways, so now,  Ben Hur ,  Titanic  and  Lord of the Rings   have 11 oscars each. I've seen and liked all of them. Now if I had to rank these three... they would be:  LOTR ,  Ben Hur , and  Titanic . Welll see...  Return of the King  is not alone. It's really about the entire  LOTR   series which is but one continuous story. It's a thousand page novel ported brilliantly onto film.  Ben Hur  doesn't have that graphic edge - understandably - as compared to today's films but the story in it is again there. And they're both really about triumph of good. Whereas  Titanic , I thought, scores brilliantly outside of the story: music, sets, etc. etc.  *** My cousin sister officially got her PhD. Congratulations to her! My little cousin sister is talking of going into a PhD program. Tsk tsk... even I'll have to do one ;-) I can't sit on my butt and remain pig ignorant while half the family has doctorates.  *** I think that's about it. G'Day. ****  Not before I post these lines from the song that's been on my mind for the past two days -  Common People  by  Pulp .  You'll never live like common people You'll never do what common people do You'll never fail like common people You'll never watch your life slide out of view And dance and drink and screw Because there's nothing else to do.  Very powerful song. It has me by my gullet.

      Last night i was out for dinner with my parents, and met a guy in the restaurant from my college.... who recognized me!!???!$L!#J!$$!$  So I was going down the stairs and he came running after me and asked me to stop. I was like... who the hell is he? Though he seemed familiar. But I could have seen him a week before. He had a stupid look on his face as if he was asking a stupid question. "have you.... ever.... been in Calcutta?"   I thought... what a stupid question. "Yeahhhhhh" I said, wondering where this was going....  "JU?" he asked... even more hestitatingly.  And i was like... "oh shit! You're from college!"  Familiar guy. I didn't really know him. But he was friends with people I knew.   At a mad moment, I had volunteered for my college elections.... so I was prominent with people... god knows who all knew me and my name. I never knew them.  I don't like my worlds colliding.... but he gave some news of a good friend of mine whom I lost contact with. He said he had a phone number somewhere.  *sigh*

      Wrote an entry in my last diary about this. And it has to be stated again. I  do  care if people read it or not. Because if they don't, then its almost a waste of writing. I know what I am thinking. I have a lot of thoughts. I know them. I like to tell them to people. I like to get reactions, input, criticism, support.   So, I want to reach out to people. If I didn't want people to read it, if I didn't want "comments", if I didn't care about what people thought, then I'd write everything in the privacy of my paper journal or would make it a "private diary."  And so for anyone else. If people truly write for themselves, then why would they post it publicly? They want to be read. They want to be understood. Acknowledged. Supported.... and all those things.  The key is readership.

      I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times... In life after life, in age after age, forever.  My spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs, That you take as a gift, wear round your neck in your many forms, In life after life, in age after age, forever.  Whenever I hear old chronicles of love, it's age old pain, It's an ancient tale of being apart or together. As I stare on and on into the past, in the end you emerge, Clad in the light of a pole-star, piercing the darkness of time. You become an image of what is remembered forever.  You and I have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount. At the hear of time, love of one for another. We have played along side millions of lovers, Shared in the same shy sweetness of meeting, the distressful tears of farewell, Old love but in shapes that renew and renew forever.

      I would like to formally apologize to any man who might have been listening to the local "hot" radio station last night at about 10 pm on behalf of the female gender as a whole.   The station went into a club and asked the women there what they looked for in a man... and the answers that were repeated over and over were embarrassing:    1. He's got to have a "tight ass". 2. He simply *has got* to be rich. 3. He's got to have a "cool" car. 4. He's got to be good in bed and "do it" all night long..  5. He's got to "buy me stuff".   This poll was supposedly taken of the entire club going population, which explains why I not only avoid clubs and people who go to them like the plague, but appropriately think of the people who go there as hollow, vain and tremendously stupid at the very core of their beings.  This is why I'm forced to explain over and over to women-hating-men that not every girl is like that... radio stations and television shows that keep this sexist stuff going. And it doesn't get easier, it gets harder to defend, because it's all men see. It's enough to make a person want to give up entirely and become a celibate soul in the world.

      I've always maintained a rule of not giving out personal information which I thought to be mindless over the net. What's the color of your hair? What's the color of your eyes? How tall are you?   In my opinion, that's all mindless junk. It ridiculous. What's the point of determining what the color of somebody's eyes is? There's that perennial question: What you do look like? When asked as the very first question, it just very superficial.   Another thing I really hate is people asking "a/s/l." I regularly get messages on AIM saying that. I never had my age or sex in my profile. But I got tired of getting that message. So, I put my age and sex in the profile albeit towards the end. I still get those messages. They only suggest that those people never bother to read the profiles first. As a rule of thumb, I never reply to any message which asks me that.  Once in a chatroom some guy got really really angry because I wasn't telling where I was "from." As a general rule, I don't offer any sort of details before talking.  Generally, I usually just start talking first. And with the people that I've struck a note, we have usually talked for hours and hours before we even asked questions about age, sex, origin, etc. That just seems right. Talk without knowing any external factors.  Though nowadays I don't really chat online anymore. I used to do it a lot a year or two ago.  I've thought about taking the opposite approach. But Its just hard to imagine myself doing this "Hi! I look like this this and this. This is how my eyes are. This is what my hair looks like. I rate myself this much in looks. Does it satisfy your criterion to talk with me?"

       Cast your eyes on the ocean Cast your soul to the sea When the dark night seems endless Please remember me   This song makes me  sad. Yet  I cannot stop listening to it.  The song brings back all sorts of memories.     There are many people in my past that I will never forget.  To them, I want to say that you will all share a precious part of my heart.  I miss you every day.  You were ripped from my life.  At the time it didn't feel like it though.  I guess trauma deadens the nerves.  Over the years I've talked to people about it.  They just don't seem to understand.  I guess I should be over it by now but I'm not.  I miss my home, my city. I always wondered how my life would have turned out had I remained.  I do have a very good life now but I still wonder.  I miss the sound of the crickets and the dark of the night.  The smell of the freshly cut green grass on a warm summer night.  Maybe some day we will meet again.

      I got a haircut. Trim, more like. Same thing, shorter length. I was feeling hot. Every time when I did my morning walk, there would be sweat trickling down my scalp. Icky feeling. So anyways, the guy asked me how long it was since I had last had a haircut and that customers like me would get his shop closed down.   *grin* I thought that was funny.

      I saw a National Geographic documentary about the search for the "afghan girl." You know... from that famous magazine cover? A while ago I had read that they had "found" the girl... I'm not sure when that was. Two years ago? Something like that.  But I was amazed by the futility of the whole exercise. You'll go find the girl. Then what? Nothing! You take more pictures, board your plane and go back. Big deal! So this photographer guy goes over there... to the same refugee camp. And he's told that the camp is scheduled to be destroyed in two days. And this guy goes... oh oh... the camp will be destroyed... how will I find the girl!!???  Somebody sure has his priorities in order.  ***  And National Geographic has another reality series called "World's Apart."   I mean... NG guys shouldn't be perpetuating stereotypes. But no. They want a suburban American family to experience Africa... so they take them to live with a nomadic tribe in Kenya... with much emphasis on them having to live in a mud-goatskin hut as compared to their luxurious suburban home with five bathroom and every kid having an electric toothbrush.   Give me a break! Who's asking them to go leave their suburban home with five bathrooms? Then they go and portray all african as being barbarians. No, that's not right. What was the phrase the kid used? something like 'I thought we were supposed to be humans.' or something like that. The tribe killed and cooked a goat, that's why.  Yes, yes. That's just un-human and barbaric. Whereas the burgers at McDonald's come from meat that's created in its laboratories!? No, no... but they do it humanely. Yes, of course. That's the argument par excellence. We cut up and eat animals, but at least we're humane. Tell that to the cow in your burger!   Seriously... if they did want to supplant them to another culture, and in africa, they could have put them in a city. It's as if "Africa" only means half-naked people who drink blood, with painted faces and spears in hand.

      A month or so ago, a french woman married a dead man. Literally. Chirac personally gave permission for her to marry her a dead person.  France also passed laws against the headscraf to safeguard the french republic's culture and character.   Yeah.... nice culture you got there! Necrophilia yes, headscarfs no! ;-))))))  I just think that it's kind of funny. Hillarious, really. But honestly, I do feel for the French.  *********  I also read this one article last week by some dude (I think he was like a Church guy - reverend, minister or something) in this Michigan paper which said something like this: "The Muslims are coming... they will kill everybody.' It went on to say it was appropriate to have France face the muslims because it opposed the US on the Iraq issue. So it's only right for France to be killed first.  Muslims, terrorism, extremism, multilateralism, radicalism, Islam, Islamism, Pacifism, Anti-war-ism, genocide - everything seemed to blend to form one thing in that article. Each one was the other.  **********  Also, Janet Jackson is the the most searched topic (by daily volume) in the history of internet searches. It beats out 9/11, pamela and paris. (and I haven't seen the Paris video... it seems the whole world has!!!). At one point, 20% of yahoo's searches were only about janet.  Later :-)

      Am I a good person? I struggle with this question all the time. I'm not even sure why it's important to me. But it is. I'd like to know that I'm a good person. I don't think I do anything that would put me in the bad-evil category though.  But why does one have to be good anyway? I dunno. And what makes a good person anyway? I try to be honest and truthful. But I may still lie, not to harm people but to get out of situations. Small white lies, they call them. I try to help people when I can. I'll even donate money now and then.   I definitely want to be in the good category. Does being honest make me good? Do I have to help people? How much?  Do I have to live simply and/or modestly? I gave up non-vegetarian food, I quit smoking, and I quit drinking. Does living modestly cover this up?  Is it okay for me to eat and drink well when I know there are people in the world who don't get anything to eat? It surely doesn't help them, right? Or do I have to send money to charities that would provide them with food as well as live modestly? How often? Does a donation I made a year ago cover me still? Does it make me a bad person if I claim it as a tax deduction?  What about alcohol and sex? Are threesomes okay? Do we get classified in 'good' or 'bad' based on our sex life? What about pornography? How does that figure in? And what about sex-for-money? Is it okay to pay for it? Or give it for money?  What are the rules here? We need a code. I think Hammurabi's code is the oldest. In any case, it's probably the oldest written code. You know Hammurabi, right? King of Babylon?   Anyway, I suppose that's where religion comes in. Codes. Religions provide a code to make it easy. But the problem with religious codes is that we can't determine which is the truly divinely given one.  So do we make our own code? A secular code? Hmm... this leads us into sociological mores and all. Hmm... interesting.  Why does it have to be so complicated? Wouldn’t it be much easier if we could be told everything - namely who created us and what he, she or it wants us to do. Give us proof of ownership and a book of rules.  And what about cursing/swearing? I swear. I swear all the time. Does that make me lose points? Yes? Then fuck it.   And let's go back to reading Camus.

      I saw this disgusting ad which somewhat showed a baby being born and well... squirted out over miles, the baby ages during the flight, gets old, and lands in its grave (Moral: life is short. play more).  But anyway... I think I saw some other birthing situations on TV as well. So there was this woman giving birth. The baby comes out. Baby cries. And this made me wonder.   Why does the baby cry right after being born?   I mean... the question is... do babies gain consciousness right after birth? Is that why they cry only after being born? Because if they're conscious before and during birth, why don't they cry when they're going through the traumatic experience of birth? It's got to be a really really traumatic experience if you're conscious, right? So maybe they're not conscious.  And if they're not conscious during birth, then what triggers that consciousness right after birth?  No idea. Will have to get a book on reproduction/birth.

What would you be if you were a piece of furniture? What tool would you be if you were a gardening tool? What tree would you be if you were a tree? And on and on and on.  Then you get people coming up with innovative answers.... oh I'd be a big tree so that I could give shade to people. Oh one with lots of branches so that children would climb on me. Clippers because I cut everybody off. A carpet because I let everybody walk on me. And blah and blah and blah.  Question: What makes you think you're gonna have a bloody choice? I don't remember getting options for being who I am right now... why would it be any different if you were a spatula or a spade?  Sheesh.  ***  They say that answers to such questions can uncover your inner self. But really... they are flawed. I mean, you can say whatever you want to say! I will be a creepy crawly vine.

      While I love being all dovey-dovey, I find the latest round of press coverage on peace between India and Pakistan quite ridiculous.  Seriously. There's no peace. There's no middle ground. There's nothing to talk about. Everybody should go back to their corner of the ring. And well... stay there.  I mean... what nonsense is this!?? And more than the stupid governmental notions of pretending there's actually something to talk about and peace to be made it's the media (as always) that has gone berserk! They actually have articles floating around about 'peace is possible' etc. etc. Like hello? Do you ever read the news?  It's as easy as pie, you know. Pakistan isn't letting go of Kashmir. India isn't letting go of Kashmir. That's it, then. Problem solved. Not so solved... but at least we can agree that there is no agreement to be made. So we can be over and done with stupid bus trips dubbed "Compromise Express."

      Last night I was flicking channels when I came across an interview of Pakistan's Foreign Minister on PTV. Ehh... bloody diplomats... can't give one straight answer. It's useless asking them questions. And whatever they're gonna say you already know. It's the standard script. Same old broken record.  Pakistan: Why are you asking us? Ask India. And while you're at it, ask about the core issue of Kashmir.  India: It's all cross-border terrorism. And it's really China we're against.  China: Silence. And we'll throw anyone who talks in prison.  Israel: It's a complete failure of the Palestinian Authority and we solely blame Arafat.  Arafat: Do you know who you're talking to? You're talking to General Arafat. *spit on your face*  Arabs: It's all the fault of Israel and Zionists.  Russia: Bloody Chechen terrorists!  Saddam: It's going to be the mother of all battles. We will teach America and it's British lapdog a lesson  Mugabe: It's the master colonial Britain and its Australian lapdog's fault.  IMF: Privatize! Raise the rates!  America: Kiss our ass!

      Ding dong... I'm bored. Bored... it's driving me crazy. I got nothing to do.   Yesterday I learnt something. I learnt that in summer, while eating an icecream bar, you have to give the icecream bar your undivided attention :-)  Oh yes... an Owl - yes an Owl - in Wisconsin got new eyes in the form of lenses. Now are we done with all medical needs for people to be giving owls eye transplants?  I think it's a funny, sad, world where Owls are given artificial eye transplants whereas if medical care for people is suggested, then you hear cries of 'fucking socialism!'  Now I'm going to move to elsewhere and be bored over there.

      The other day it was really hot outside. I was wearing black. So obviously I was having a miserable time out in the sun. I was walking with a friend and exclaimed something like 'God.. turn off the heater! Put a filter on the sun!' Now this guy thought I was being unreasonable in saying that.   Said more plainly, this guy thought I was being crazy. And I told him that. That he thought that I was crazy. But was I? Was I really being crazy?  I told him that you have people everywhere praying to god for all sorts of things. Nobody thinks they're crazy or unreasonable. From praying for rain to good weather to good crops to winning the lottery to getting good grades to prosperity to peace to well-being of loved ones to everything else - you have it all! Yet no one thinks those guys are odd!   And people think me and my little sun filter request is crazy! Tsk tsk. You can't know how people think and behave.  If a religious dude said he talks to god then he'd be termed spiritual. If I said I talked with god, I'd be declared either loony or a heretic. If john edwards talks with dead people, they give him a TV show. If I said publicly that I talked with dead people, I'm sure they'd send me to a nut house!  Fact is that  people do all sorts of crazy things . If you do it under the right cover or label then you're okay. But if you do it of your own accord then god help you! But I have a feeling he won't ;-)

      Bush recently questioned classifying jobs at Mcdonald's as manufacturing jobs. Hmmm. Okay – thinking of it without any political motives, I don't see anything wrong with it.  Manufacturing results in the creation of goods - frying burgers at McDonald's creates burgers. So it’s not creating burgers out of thin air but it's the final step in creating a finished good for consumption. McDonald's probably operations throughout the entire value chain. It'll have farms which deliver their good to an operation that adds value and converts beef into patties. The actual food outlet engage in a further value-adding process.  I think if the same conversion (cooking food) was happening in a factory, it would be considered manufacturing. The problem here can be that manufacturing can be perceived as creating only mechanical products. With that line of argument, it can be argued that frying burgers fits into the food service industry.   That would be quite true. McDonalds and its activities do fit in the food service industry. But the grouping level we're talking about is higher than the industry-type grouping. When we talk of the food service industry, we can also talk of the publishing industry, media, farming industry, etc. In that category, frying burgers at McDonald's would indeed fit into the food service industry.  But if we talk of manufacturing, then other items at its equivalent level would be service sector, agriculture, etc. In these groupings, the only one that would potentially suit frying burgers is the service industry.  So is frying burgers providing a service to consumers? No, it's not. It's adding value to a physical good. The people who work at a cash register are in a customer-service-ish position - they could be in the service job category.   Airlines definitely fall into the service industry. They're delivering something intangible to you. Hotels provide you with an intangible good - your stay. Tourism - that's service.   Frying burgers definitely doesn't fall into service. It's adding value to a tangible good - it's a manufacturing job. It just comes way down in the value-chain.  But there's a hole here. I can see that. I think we have a problem in porting this theory. I think it works well in the factory setting as it does for McDonald’s. But i have some doubts about it being applied to restaurants.   Is cooking food considered manufacturing in restaurants? Hmmm... not really. Nah... it's still okay. It just sounds odd. Restaurants are at the juxtaposition... they're providing service as well as goods.   Besides, even if the restaurant factor doesn't work out - McDonalds' definitely will. Because they've perfected it in that manufacturing line style. In any other case people don't mind knocking down Mcdonald's for its homogenized factory-line way of producing and serving food. Yeah, fastfood can qualify for manufacturing status even if restaurant food doesn't.

      Okay, time to do a " Where are they now " survey.   Does anyone remember  urlLink Jimmy Ray ? His debut single(Are you Jimmy Ray) became a hit around 1997. The song (with lyrics that went Are you Johhny Ray, who wants to know, are you Sting Ray, who wants to know) features Jimmy in a neo-rockabilly image - leather-clad and guitar-bound, rolling dice in Vegas casinos, while two dancers (one of them called Aretha?) shimmy-shake around him in cheerleading gear.  I did buy the album. Funny thing was that most of his music was good. Or so I thought at the time.

      Tom Petty - You don't know how it feels.  I've been recommended by someone to go listen to Joan Baez "Love song to a Stranger part II" (lyrics on  urlLink Google ) I have not heard it yet.   Honestly, I don't understand much of the Dylan/Baez generation that everyone goes on about. Give me angsty Alanis Morrisette anyday.

      Delhi's getting hotter. I could wake up at at 5.45 in the morning AND crawl out of bed - a month ago, this would have an almost impossible endeavour, as the blanket curled around you, wrapped you up in its folds and just refused to let you go.   * That's the way we singletons romanticize our mornings, instead of lovers' arms, we have woollen tentacles that cling to us. * This kind of fatalism is only normal, since I spent most of yesterday thinking about whether I would ever get to have another normal succesful romantic relationship with a male.  Fears were compounded my ex-best friend (gay) from college called up in the evening, and when I began ranting, he commented non-chalantly, "Yes, maybe you won't, but then, as you grow older, your perspective and definition of relationships will also change."   What? What is he on about? That, as I grow older, I:  a) Really might never ever EVER (pant pant), have a successful relationship. b) Get so warped and deranged in the head that will come to regard talking to the one week old eggs in my fridge as *successful* romantic interaction.   Nice start to a Monday. I'm off to work now.

      Damn you asses who make my life one notch below terrific!   ~Just felt like saying that aloud, somehow :-) The excitement of a new blog is getting to me. I have done glorious nada work since the morning, rediscovering my passion for blogging. I maintained an anonymous diary on Freeopendiary.com for ages, that contained adolescent raves about the meaning of life and other such topics one tends to devote a lot of time to, when young. Then I got weary of it all, and finally, they deleted my diary after 15 days of being inactive. I wish I could somehow retrieve that material, it would be good to see how i've changed (or if at all I have) but no such luck.   Will have to get back to work now. I hate the way colleagues will  ALWAYS  peer into your screen to see who you are chatting with, which Web sites you are visiting etc. Can't help admitting that I do it too.

      Yesterday I met SS, an extremely charming and debonair fashion designer from one of the networking communities I inhabit. It's very funny, when I think of it now. He's from another city, and was coming here on some assignment. So we had exchanged barely 7 e-mails, and spoken on the telephone twice, and here I was, asking him out!   Not the kind of thing I usually do.   More about the meeting. We managed to steal some time at a handicraft bazaar, where he was sipping fruit beer and sketching on his German notebook. Very cool, I thought, as he waved across. Tall, breezy, sunglasses worn across the back of his head, a double-dolphin silver pendant, *unkempt* sideburns.   We spoke a lot - about work, college (turns out that we are from the same university back home), and trends when another female friend of his showed up, and I was rather surprised. Had never been on a blind-double date before.   As far as I was concerned, the evening was over. The rest was all a blur. I could have gone into descriptive detail about how they laughed about the most personal jokes, as I winced uncomfortably all the time.  Boy was I glad when it was time to go. I bolted out and was happier for it.   Yet another one of my romantic successes.  Aaress, when will you EVER learn :-)

      The other day I was talking to a friend and he informed me that the human soul weighed 21 grams. While I was choking and gasping on that nugget of information, he actually went on to say that medical science has conclusively proved that when a human being dies, he loses 21 gms of his body weight immediately. It actually has to do something about the moisture content, but has traditionally been associated with the weight of a human soul.   The moment I heard this, I was like, Ok, I am going to write a blog entry about this. And he was like, No, I knew it first, so I am going to write one! At which I said, FINE, alright! You write about it and in any case you won't be able to write as well as me, so I'll polish your entry and pass it off as mine. This morning I checked into his blog, and here is what he's written. I'll just do a copy-paste here, for I think no one can improve on this.  Cheers Rohan!  ------------  They say we all lose 21 grams at the exact moment of our death everyone...  The weight of a stack of nickels, The weight of a chocolate bar, The weight of a hummingbird.  The weight of our soul perhaps?  How much we meant to others?

      Was reading through a friend's profile on Orkut. I always pay a great deal of attention to what people say they have learned from their past relationships - it reveals a great deal about where they're coming from. But I was really impressed to read this - it sort of sums up my take on the entire man-woman-love scenario.   Never live in indecision, it might harm your relationship and the others involved in it. Never presume, and always remember to ask for love, it doesn't come otherwise.

      I watched  Shrek  again couple of days ago.... hmm... not bad. Actually, the first thing that impressed me were the graphics. Wow... awesome!  Next point in the movie... you know... this is just the typical storyline. Ugly Ogre. Beautiful princess. What to do? Or even princess and the frog type thing.   But anyways... so they kept saying that the princess who was an ogre during the night would change to permanently beautiful after the first kiss of true love.  How romantic. ( notice the sarcasm ).  So.... I wasn't happy in the end. The princess didn't turn into the beautiful princess. In fact, the thing back fired.... and she was an ogre all the time now.   'I don't understand... I was supposed to turn beautiful'  said the ugly princess.  'But you are'  said the ugly ogre.  Tsk tsk. how typical. you are beautiful if you think you are beautiful. beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. Yuck.  I was really hoping that when they kiss, the ugly ogre would turn into a handsome prince and he and the beautiful princess will live happily ever after.  But noooo. nooooo. they gotta do that ugly-is-beautiful thing.  Ppsssh. Whatever.

       Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall Humpty Dumpty had a great fall All the king's horses, and all the king's men Couldn't put Humpty together again.   I ask you... do you see any egg mentioned in those lines? Do you see any reference to what or how much Humpty ate? Do you see any indication of Humpty's Body-Mass Indicator ratio? Any mention of how much Humpty exercised?  All it says is that Humpty was sitting on a wall. And just based on that one line - which doesn't tell you anything about Humpty - Humpty Dumpty is time again subject to be shown like a fat, egg-shaped person!  Time and again, my client Humpty Dumpty, is subject to ridicule, discrimination and bias based on an imaginary image that potrays my client as a fat, obese, and clumsy egg. This is cleary a case of defamation against Humpty Dumpty run by sinister and cruel people who take joy in others' misfortunes.  Infactual and inaccurate, Your Honor, I seek the motion to bar images displaying Humpty Dumpty as an egg from being used in connection with Mr. Dumpty's name.

      I used the word "muchless" while talking to someone last night. 'Is it a word?' I thought while I was saying it. 'Of course it is,' I reasoned. I put it down. Then later - a lot lot later - I went to bed.  After I woke up, I started thinking. Is 'muchless' a word? Where did I get that from? It seems like an oxymoron!  I set out to find the truth behind muchless. I went to Merriam Webster, arguably the original lexicon (everybody's always fighting for the rights to use the name "webster"). No "muchless" on m-w.com  Now, I would have liked to refer to the Oxford dictionary. But they don't have it in their head yet that a normal person wouldn't really pay $800 for an annual subscription to a dictionary. So, I couldn't use their site.  That led me to use my paper copy - the pocket edition of Oxford dictionary. Trust me, it's not going to fit in anybody's pocket. Show me one pocket that fits it besides those on a parka!  No "muchless" in the pocket dictionary. So, it's not in the American ones. It's not in the English ones. I just punched it through dictionary.com, though I didn't really expect anything.  Next, I ran the word through google.com to see if the word was being used by people. It returned me 800 pages where muchless was used. I saw it being used in newsletter, conversations, articles, government sites - all over.  Still I seeked the definition of 'muchless.' Basically, what I meant to say was that one situation was far more likely than the other. for example "the store doesn't carry beer, muchless hard liquor." I think "fat chance" could be substituted where I'd use "muchless."  So, I found a YahooGroup for programming in XBasic. There they listed a conditional statement MuchLess among other ones called OneLess, OneMore. Weird.  I came across one paper on logic and reasoning. Here's what it had to say about 'muchless': "As an exercise define a relation MUCHLESS of two arguments which returns TRUE if its second argument exceeds its first by more than 100."  Hmmm. Well, in terms of logic that is really what it should mean. One is what is, the other just totally unlikely. This one is kind of reversed. Typically, the second one would be more unlikely one.  And that pretty much ended the quest for "muchless." No definition found. But people are using it. Glad to know that I didn't coin it overnight ;-)

         After I posted the Serena Williams photograph, I was wondering about the players who specialize on clay. And I remembered my childhood crush - Sergi Bruguera - the winner of the French Open titles in 1993 and 1994. Arguably the best Spaniard on the circuit, Bruguera at his best was better than the much-publicised Carlos Moya, Alberto Berasatagui, Felix Mantilla, Alex Corretja and Alberto Costa. He made three slam finals at the French because he could rally with only the best.   So he boycotted the Wimbledons because his game was very rigid. He could volley well, but his backswings were too long. And the grass surface has never been too kind to players with big backswings. And although he played a very patient baseline game, his grips on the racquet are extreme since he creates a lot of top-spin. I've been told that is a very conservative style but what the hell, he won two grand Slam titles based on it!

      I'm SICK and TIRED of the monotony that surrounds me. Even as I type this entry, I'm looking at the people sitting around me, and wondering they're as edgy as I am, and are only hiding it better.  Quite frankly, I've had enough of this dread routine - get up in the morning, go to work, try to reach out to people, come back, scout for some good company, crave for some good conversation, cook dinner, watch a movie, and then hit the sack.  And I've actually spoken to people about this. They're all like -  But Reshma, you live alone, we are far worse - imagine being answerable to parents, telling them how late you'll be at night, we can't even talk for long hours on the phone, we can't watch our favourite serials at home!   But is that  IT ? The freedom to choose a channel, or have long telephonic chats? Is that ALL they're missing out? What about the basic need to just reach out to people? What about the freedom to just take off, whenever you want to, with whoever you want to? For instance, as of now, all I want to do is to like pack two sets of clothing and just fuck the hell out of here. Out of this rathole of this office, out of the reach of deadlines, and out of this city with its  paani  and  bijli  problems.   I was talking to Mum last night, and cribbing about the lack of action in my life, and she said I was really over-doing it. She actually brought out data to support that I was likely to have more excitement in my life than any other person of my age living in my country.  Hmm whatever. Maybe I really am looking for too much in life.   Last night, there was a sandstorm at 3.30, and a powercut along with it. So I just walked out onto the balcony. Heady experience - darkness all around, and not a soul anywhere, only the sound of the gusts of wind. I just stood there for sometime, and for a change, I did not think about anything - I just let it wash over me. Hmm, nice.

      Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth; oh nevermind; you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded. But trust me, in 20 years you’ll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can’t grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked.   You’re not as fat as you imagine.   Don’t worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that  never crossed your worried mind; the kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle Tuesday.   Do one thing everyday that scares you.    Sing    Don’t be reckless with other people’s hearts, don’t put up with people who are reckless with yours.    Floss    Don’t waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you’re ahead, sometimes you’re behind…the race is long, and in the end, it’s only with yourself.   Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insults; if you succeed in doing this, tell me how.   Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements.    Stretch    Don’t feel guilty if you don’t know what you want to do with your life…the most interesting people I know didn’t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives, some of the most interesting 40 year  olds I know still don’t.   Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees, you’ll miss them when they’re gone.   Maybe you’ll marry, maybe you won’t, maybe you’ll have children,maybe you won’t, maybe you’ll divorce at 40, maybe you’ll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary…what ever you do, don’t congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either – your choices are half chance, so are everybody else’s.    Enjoy your body, use it every way you can.  Don’t be afraid of it, or what other people think of it, it’s the greatest instrument you’ll ever own..   Dance…even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room.   Read the directions, even if you don’t follow them.   Do NOT read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly.   Get to know your parents, you never know when they’ll be gone for good.   Be nice to your siblings; they are the best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.   Understand that friends come and go,but for the precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle because the older you get, the more you need the people you  knew when you were young.    Travel.    Accept certain inalienable truths, prices will rise, politicians will philander, you too will get old, and when you do you’ll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.   Respect your elders.   Don’t expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you have a wealthy spouse; but you never know when either one might run out.   Don’t mess too much with your hair, or by the time you're 40, it will look 85.   Be careful whose advice you buy, but, be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it’s worth.

      Such a temptress, such a tease!  Why, and just why does this have to happen to me? Just when I'm at the end of my tethers, seething with rage at this city and its uncouth boorish brutal ways and the harsh weather, Delhi does something and charms me again.   Really, this weather is SUCH a tease! Like a cruel lover who will just not give in, who'll make you go mad with craving, and drive you to desperation, who will make you rage, rant, and rave, but will still not give in. Then, when you're tired of waiting and don't want to see his face again, he will come to you to kiss you, to fuse fresh life into you.   And I hate myself for having fallen for this bitch of a city all over again.   My Winamp, the bastard of appropriateness, belts out Kiss the Rain by Billie Myers:    Hello  Do you miss me? I hear you say you do But not the way I'm missing you What's new? How's the weather? Is it stormy where you are? Cause I'm so close  But feels like you're so far   P.S. = Right now I'm totally unsettled emotionally. Promise I will behave better tomorrow :-) Love you all.

      I got this mail forward from a friend. Ordinarily I junk all forwards without reading it, but I opened this one. It started with the addressing "Dear Single Friend." I told myself that if ever there was a correct addressing made, it was this one!!  So they have this questionnaire in there which you are supposed to fill and send back. After that they are supposed to do a phone meeting with "in-depth" questions and anohter "Checklist chat" where they get the "lion's share" of your "dating criteria." Hmm... so, I thought... of course I'm not going to do this thing... but... hey... I could fill out the questions in my blog .... with my very witty and smartass comments. So, here goes.... typing out their entire form:  PLEASE TELL US ABOUT YOURSELF...   1) What is your marital Status?   (X)Single ()Divorced ()Widowed ()Legally Separated  Very much single thank you. And okay, that wasn't funny at all ;-)   2)Are you new to your city?  ()Yes (X)NO If yes, from where?_______ Nahhh... well... ya know... i've been here in this place for 4.5 years... I don't think you could call that being new.   3)What is your educational background?  ()High School ()Some College ()Master's ()Ph. D. (X)College Graduate  Now... err... I wonder why college graduate option is not placed at #2 before masters? Anybody know why? But anyway... I checked college graduate.   4)Are you employed?  ()Full Time ()Part Time (X)No  What is your current occupation? _______  Nopes... I'm a bum. I don't do anything... I don't study and I don't want to work. Somebody marry me please ;-)   5) Income? ()Under $15,000 ()$15,001 to $25,000 ()$25,001 to $35,000 ()$35,001 to $50,000 ()$50,001 to $75,000 ()$75,001 to $100,000 ()Over $100,000  Me... money? No... I don't make ANY money. Err... about those last two options.... I mean... If I was making 100k or more... you don't think I'd be filling out one of these stupid questionnaires, do you? I'd have eligible bachelors lined all over for interviews to fill the position.   6)What are your relationship goals?   ()Casual Dating ()Long-term Relationship (X)Marriage Marriage... I always say that it the ultimate goal. And I know everybody says 'no, you shouldn't have such high goals or expectations and high expectations are what cause the downfall or disappointments'... but... I think in my own way.   I mean... I think it is strange to say 'yeah I want to date this girl but I don't think i'd be interested in marrying her and/or i'm not interested for that purpose... I mean.... dude... move on to some girl you ARE interested in. Same goes for saying "short term" and "long term".... I mean... 'yeah I'm looking to date... but nothing long term.... I will cut off all communication at precisely 6 months because I don't want anything longterm.' I am not saying that people should just marry somebody right after meeting them... but... I think that's the end-goal anyways... and putting a time limit restriction before even starting the dating seems ridiculous to me.   7)How long have you considered an alternative way of meeting people?   Moi? Well... never. But... welll... I mean... hey I've been chatting with people online for 4-5 years now. Is that alternative? Is that 'meeting?' Cuz... I mean... I just didn't declare the goal of dating, right?   8)What encouraged you to complete this questionnaire?  To be quite honest..... I thought that I'd make smartass comments at the questions listed.   9) Which age group do you prefer dating?   Ummm.... let's say... err... 24 to err... umm... lets say... err... 31? That's -2 and +5 my age.    10)Would you like to meet someone who has children?  Umm.... see... at this age... children... Hell NO!!!   11)What minimum educational background do you prefer?  ()High School (X)Some College ()Associate's Degree ()Bachelor's Degree ()Master's ()Ph. D. ()Does not matter  I suppose... well... they can be .... I mean... the more the better. Even I'll pursue a masters... in some time.    14)What areas of interest would you like to share with someone?  ()Competitive Sports (X)Outdoor Pursuits (X)Cultural Activities ()Dancing ()Music (X)Other Interests  Hmm... what does competitive sports mean? I mean... we can go to the gym. That's not competitive sports, is it? I'm not out to do a 400 meter hurdling event. How about tennis? I think that is covered in outdoor pursuits.   15) What height range do you prefer?   Does height matter? Well i dunno... hmm... well... i think... well... I mean... if he's already way taller than me... and then goes and wears huge fat sneakers, I'm gonna look like his kid! Hehe!   15)What qualities do you look for in a person of the opposite sex?  Ahh... qualities in a man. Alright... err... Man. Qualities. Concentrate Concentrate.   The word 'intelligent' is coming to mind... but that's not the word I want to use. Not even 'smart'. Ok... we'll go with something between intelligent and smart. Courteous, Perceptive? Independent. And well.. you know... a good heart... ya know... caring and all that. And I don't mean towards me, I mean towards others.   Alright... should have at least some of the same interests as me. I mean... you know... you need a common base. There need to be things that can excite us both. What am I generally interested in doing? Yes, well... I watch a lot of movies, and I read a lot! So it'd be nice if he likes that kind of entertainment. I really keep abreast of current affairs and news. While I don't say that he has to be a news buff... he should certainly not be living cut off from the world in a cocoon and not know Poland from Portugal.  I mean, I get along best with people with whom I can talk about anything and everything. For that you just need to know the world around you.  Hmm... well... we'll want to go and visit places... so you know... it would be nice if he likes going places too.   And I'd like if he was an early riser. I mean... you know... we can have early morning breakfast together... so that you actually spend time together doing things. There's really no point in leading altogether separate lives.

        Which would you chose if you had the chance to pick one: a week of the best sex you could ever have or a lifetime of green stoplights in traffic?    I got this question while browsing some books on  urlLink Amazon  and thought that I'd answer it here. So here goes:  Huh? There's no choice given. The answer is obvious, DUH! Green traffic lights for life!!!!!  I mean... like... green lights. That carries a lot of weight... and what makes the weight is not just the green lights... but a lifetime of them.  That... compared to a week of fantastic sex... which undeniably is fantastic... but a week of that... compared to a lifetime of going unhindered in traffic... i mean... you gotta choose the traffic lights over sex :-P

      To people who use Netscape... stop it, will ya?  Eees no goood!   Get IE. Or if you really want to use Netscape... pick up Netscape 6. Just dump that 4.5 and 4.7!  That good for nothing, unforgiving, non-compliant bag of bytes!  In a perfect world... everybody would go kill the development team of Netscape 4.7 and the world would be rid of the menace.   *************  Couple of years ago, I was printing Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening at home, when my cousin brother came and thought I was printing one of my poems. Apparently, he wasn't familiar with the exact wording of the poem. I didn't tell him that it wasn't mine, but I took the poem and started reading it to him. With every line I read, he was flabbergasted and kept repeating something to the order of "oh my god, you wrote this?" I didn't say anything. When I reached the lines "The woods are lovely, dark, and deep," his expression changed, he squinted his eyes and told me never to do that to him again. Hahahaha. That was really funny!  *************  Yesterday I saw  Hellboy .

       I've got a crush on Reshma. Well, It's ok if she has a boyfriend :( Iglesias's 'Hero' seeping into my headphones... this is getting surreal!!!!!   How many guys would do that? How many guys would have the guts and the temerity to publish that on a public blog? Well,  urlLink Arjun Kariyal  certainly has what it takes to figure on my Top Guys of the Millennium list.     A few facts about him -  1) He works in AT Kearney in Hotel Taj Mansingh. 2) He is a super-arty guy. 3) He's a Gemini. 4) He takes French classes when he is bored. 5) Today I discovered that he is a Malayali. That's not HIGH on the want-list, but it's just that I thought he was a Himachali.  I've met him twice on account of work and never spoken to him on the phone. But hey, I'm hoping to improve that count!

      The BBC has come up with a new face for christ. And let's be frank. The faces manages to turn heads. The blue eyes are gone. The angular features are gone. The shoulder length hair are gone. Hell.... the pale white complexion is gone!!!!  The new complexion is brownish. Short dark hair & beard. I looked at that... and I read the article... and I was like... duh! What was I thinking all the time? All those pictures not of a guy from the middle east... I guess I could put it softly... "that was the image the europeans envisioned Jesus Christ to be like"... or I could say it a like... it was: "they put a white guy there to suit their own background"  This picture they came up with is based on forensic evidence. Its not really like... Jesus' picture... its the picture of the average guy who did work in a similar conditions. They got a first century skull to serve as a base or prototype.  Now one interesting thing they have done is that they took the geneology of Jesus Christ from the KJV bible and also based it on that.... which is... err... little bit strange I would say. I mean... if you believe in Jesus Christ... and you believe in his miracle birth... then... errr... there's no father's side, is there? So... how can you have a geneology from the father's side? 'splain that!  A historian from the University of London said that what those guys had done was just "archeological fiction." Yeah... he's right. Wonder if they said the same about Rembrandt and Raphael's pictures. ;-)) haha.  Then the article ends in the customary negation of everything that is done in any article by saying "does the image of Jesus really needs to be known?" Answer: Not if he was brown!!!!  hahahahaha.    urlLink http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/virtualjesus010327.html

      I got an email from my cousin bro sister saying that my other bro wants to maintain his nice image and didn't want to appear like a busybody. Hence, Cousin #2 asked Cousin #1 to ask me which of following was "the boyfriend."  Then three choices A,B,C were listed with D being "None of the Above."  Of course, the names were pulled from the emails that I forward them sometimes. The most frequent male names were taken. That's why I also use BCC in sending emails.  Tsk Tsk Tsk. Don't they realize... I do NOT have a life. None whatsoever. Nada. Zilch. In fact... I was in fact trying to find people by yelling out "Alloooo there" some hours ago ;-)  So, I sent back the appropriate response: "No Comments."   God, cousin Brothers !!!!

      Beloved bloggers,  I'm sorry I haven't been able to update my blog regularly. This week is all about trainings. I'm being taken through extensive workshops and boot-camps on leadership/writing/editing skills.   Yesterday we did the DiSC analysis and I turned out to a type I. Which stands for Influential/Insipirational. I wanted to be D (Domineering). I feel cheated. Who wants to be an emotional and expressive when you have the choice of being whip-toting slavedriver?  Hmmm well whatever.   I will write soon. Miss you all dearly!  Love, Me.

      I was reading this article where they said that primitive woman did not really bother about the look of the male penis. Because if they were choosing their mates based on the look, males would have colored, shiny, flourescent penises and scrotums much like some other animals they showed. They also said that the male penis (that's redundant I think... after all... is there a female penis? No. So "male penis" is really redundant) has a very sorry look today.  What else? They said that people are attracted to other people who resemble them.    A flourescent penis?   They had this software which converted images from male to female and vice versa. They used that to convert images to the opposite gender and gave them to people. And the photos that people chose as the most attractive ones were their own "testosteronized" or "estrogenized" image.   But really... flourescent penises? How about glow-in-the-dark ones?    Oh Oh... another thing was interesting. They said that evolutionists (is that something?) still cannot answer why the present-day female breasts are the size they are. They say that there's no reason for them to be that big.... that all other female mammals have really small ones. Breast-feeding didn't require that big breasts, so there was no reason for them to evolve that big.  Except except except... they didn't consider this... male ancestors could have chosen only those female mates who had big breasts.... after all... they were males, right? ;-)    Flourescent penises?

      Yesterday I was going through my booklet on  Waiters on Wheels  - you know, the meal service that let's you order from any restaurant in the city. And I called a posh restaurant, and asked them the minimum order value, to which they said it was Rs 500. And I was hmm... dude... that's like a WEEK full of Chinese food.  So I thought... Reshma, go ahead, outline what you want, list stuff - and I did, and it came to around Rs 225. And so I was like OH NO, that leaves me to order for 275 more bucks. So I listed four more things which brought the total up to 500 bucks. And yes, I ordered.   When the food came, I was like ....Mein Gott.  BBBIIIIIGGGGG  packet!!! There was  a WEEK's worth of Chinese in there. The very thought of having to survive on Schezwan for an entire week just freaked me out. And I did what I normally do when I get freaked out - kept watching TV :-)  It's a pity that Indian Chinese joints don't have a fortune cookie thing with them. Fortune cookies are great fun. Once a friend told me - always add "in bed" after what the fortune cookie says.... its improves the message by leaps and bounds ;-)  So... then I was dividing up the bill... and... it was not just coming right. I was over with dinner... was just watching TV... but in my head was... " why why why  WHY  is it not coming right? It doesn't make sense. I calculated again, and again! How could I have paid more than I was supposed to! " Not that I was concerned about the money... it was just a puzzling concept to me. Just wasn't happening.  And I thought....that's what you get when you've given up maths after your tenth standard - you cannot do the math required to split a bill - and that's a pretty sorry situation! Then later it dawned upon me... the tip... the tip... the tip!!!!!!!!! So  THAT  is where the extra 20 bucks went!!!  Whew. For a moment I was losing confidence in myself there. Hehe.  Ok whatever... i was full, and there is like a TON of chinese food in the fridge... i mean a TON.

      Actually he has a name. Bonzi. I installed BonziBuddy yesterday. For the second time actually. He's my friend Gorilla... or so he says. He also says that he's the brightest gorilla around... and I wouldn't know of another gorilla that can find do price comparing on the Web. Bonzi tells some very nice jokes. Bonzi tells a lots of Facts ("An ant can carry upto 50 times its weight, and pull up to 30 times its weight"... then Bonzi added "Even I could do that - lift 50 times an Ant's weight"). Bonzi sings daisy daisy.  Actually, our Project Manager was talking about Bonzi ... we looked over it for about 5 minutes... she's interested in Artificial Intelligence... so she was geenrally talking about it.  So, she suggested that we install and look at BonziBuddy. Its a gorilla that is always on your desktop... much like Office's paperclip. Bonzi talks though... you can hear audio.   They have filled it up with a lot of stuff. I clicked 'joke' a number of times... then Bonzi said "Reshma, I didn't really know that you liked my jokes that much." (yeah... it calls you by name)  Bonzi said "Have I told you lately that I love you" hehe...

      A week or two ago, I read this comment "The military is what makes a country great"... and proceeding further in saying that the Democratic Party is causing the US to lose it greatness. etc etc.  Hmmm. So the military made the nation great, huh? Hmm. Personally, I think Greatness isn't derived from Power (with a capital P).  You are not Great because you have Power. Your actions make you great, not the power by which you could do whatever you want to.   In the movie  Schindler's List , Oskar Schindler talked with this General about power/greatness/mercy. The writer put it well. It when you have the power to do something and yet choose to forgive... that made you great. Its the action. Its not the Power.  Greatness and Might not the same. They are not mutually exclusive, but they don't neccessarily go hand in hand. The great may not be mighty. The Mighty may not be great.  Power. Usually in school... in the lower grades... there is a bully who might just snatch away some small kid's lunch. How many people see greatness in that? You aren't great by having power!  The military doesn't make a nation great. This does not mean that you have to downscale your military. Keep it as strong as you want. But... it doesn't bring greatness.  It can bring fear in others. But not respect.

        Remember him? Right, that's Andrew Ridgeley.  I was searching through the Boys folder on my MP3 collection and I found the Wham songs that I'd practically grown up on - Careless Whisper, Last Christmas, Wake me up before you go-go, and yes, Freedom. And while we all know what George Michael is doing (i.e. going to bed with Elton John and belting lyrics like I'll be your sexual freak, for a week), no one seems to care about what happened to the other guy from Wham.   Andrew Ridgeley, who was George Michael's sidekick, partner, boy-toy, whatever..  So I did Googled a little and here's what I found: 1) After WHAM split, Ridgeley married the lead singer of the girl band Bananarama. No, don't know her name.  2) He then moved to Monaco where he failed at a career as race car driver (he crashed a few times and couldn't find sponsors).  3) Signed with Columbia records in 1990 and did one solo album "Son of Albert". 4) Now owns a restaurant called "Bar 92."  Hmmm. I think I should do more of these "Whatever happened to" entries.  Random Trivia: How many of you know George Michael's real name? It's Georgious Panayiotu :-) Yeah, he's Greek.

      When I took psychology, we went over types of memory aids.... I forget the exact term... but there was one thing that was supposed to trigger another memory not with much relation between them.  Columbus sailed the deep sea blue, in fourteen hundred ninety two! rhymes!  There was that one I learnt when I was small:  My Very Educated Mother Just Serve Us Nine Pizza-pies. Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto   Trigonometry:  All Silver Tea Cups. All Students Take Coffee. All Sin Cos Tan. All are positive in the first quadrant, Sin is positive in the second quadrant, Cos is positive in the third quadrant, Tan is positive in the fourth quadrant.   Network Stuff:  Please Do Not Touch Steve's Pet Alligator. Physical Datalink Network Transport Session Presentation Application.  All seven layers of the OSI model!!!  So I was doodling with names of countries of the European Union, trying to remember which all were monarchies. I wrote down their letters and started making words out of them.   I came up with: Bles(s) DNS! (for computer people... DNS is very easy to know... domain name server... or for the microsoft people: digital nervous system).  Belgium Luxembourg England Sweden Denmark Netherlands Spain. That was easy!  Hmm... Actually I had always wanted to list all the mnemonics I knew in one place ('mnemonics'... was that the term he used?)... So I just thought I'd put them all here with my Bless DNS.   Though I think I must be forgetting some. There were surely more famous and standard ones. Of course, I have always made up other customized ones in my course of studying.  Its funny the way they can help you remember things. You just remember one word.... and each part of it triggers another piece of memory.  So cool!   ***Afterword****   i remembered another one: Some People Have Curly Brown Hair Till Proper Brushing. Sin = Perpendicular/Hypotenuse. Cos=Base/Hypotenuse. Tan=Perpendicular/Base. Hehe :-)

        You have a heartsick soul! Youre the type of girl who always has a crush and is writing their name on all your books. You are a hopeless romantic. Waiting for that prince charming, you take love seriously, but still play any chance you get. You can have a lot if boys who are friends, but waiting for that perfect boyfriend. Sometimes you are discouraged because there are no sparks but even if the smallest thing happens, youre on Cloud 9.  You believe in true love and wait for it. Just dont be afraid to take a chance. Love is all about risks.    urlLink   What Kind of SOUL do you posses? (For Girls only) Incredible Anime Pictures!     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      So there is this site called  urlLink AmIHotOrNot.com  where you can post your picture and other people coming on the site give you a score from 1 to 10. The scores are tallied and an average is displayed. And they claim to have 700,000 photos. Actually I had read about this site somewhere long time back... in some article. But today I just kinda followed to it from bored.com  Anyway... so... Hmm... You know... I tried voting on it... and I must say... personally it was tough for me to live low scores. The way I see it... you could really kill someone's morale.... when the average score they get is a 2. That's what I think. It can also serve as an ego booster to those who get high scores. But... like... ya know... I felt bad giving somebody a low score.  But then again... they themselves have put their photo up and asked for it to be judged. So they're getting what they asked for.  Ummm.... so what is this? is this the desire for approval from people? or is this just entertainment? Or is there really a deeper psychological or sociological meaning to this?  In any case... I was feeling like a bad person when I was clicking on a low score... so i quit scoring. Its evil evil evil!!!!

      Over the weekend, I was talking to someone about gifts. About what kind of a "gifter" he was. You know, whether he was the kind who would give a utility gift or I-don't-see-any-use-for-this-but-it-looked-cool-so kind of gifter. So as usual, I was complaining about the gifts that I get, or don't get, and that set me thinking... Is this a girl-specific phenomenon?  I hear so MUCH of it around me -   "Oh he didn't give me this. He didn't give me that.  He knew how much I wanted some other thing. How could he give me this?"    I mean, what the hell. First of all, gifts are a gesture of good will. They are not obligatory. so nobody is obliged to give anything much less this or that or whatever. And some people are like - SO hungry for material things. Is that all they can think of... what thing they're being given and how much it cost? It's like you know... you show how much you care by giving gifts. You show how much sorry you are by giving gifts. Amount of romance and love is measured by the kind of gift. Sheesh!  But then I do have a point on utility gifts. Ever since I moved out of home, all my gifts have been  SO  utilitiarian that I sometimes feel like tearing my hair out.   Here's a random list of what I've got so far -  1) Steam iron 2) Emergency Lamp for power cuts 3) Umbrella 4) Toaster 5) Telephone (pink transparent Panasonic thing, vaguely bordering on the fancy) 6) Tiffin boxes 8) Water bottles   I mean, at this stage, what wouldn't I do for a useless gift - a teddy bear/fur-lined cushions/bubble chair from Ikea etc.  So well guys, my house is very well-equipped. It's more home-y than most singleton homes I've seen till now. Ergo, just forget the utility items and roll out the fancy useless junk!!!!!

      Last night at about two thirty I picked up a Cosmopolitan. No, don't ask WHY i was up so late, I won't tell you :-) And there were these two questions for the liberated emancipated woman of today, so I'm going to try and asnwer them here:    If you were dating this man and he's absolutely gorgeous and fun and wonderful and then he sits you down and says "I'm a hermaphrodite." would you still date him?    No no no... that just can't be so. As I have stated before, they gotta be opposite sex, straight, hetero sexual, permanent  same sex, never modified, never tampered with... etc etc etc. And besides that... anytime I'd look at him... I'd be thinking of ya know... that other stuff.  Gotta end right there. sad as it is... but I can't rectify or play sweet when nature played a cruel joke.   If you could do anything (ANYTHING) with your life before you die, what would it be?    Well... am I being given wishes? Or are we talking realistically here? :-) Hmm... I don't know. What do I want to do? See places? climb the highest mountain? discover a cure for a deadly  disease? faciliate world peace? Or should I talk realistically? ummm.... I don't know... I guess... just lead a good, honest  life with integrity... in the middle somewhere... I would really like to do something to be remembered by.... I think... I  want to write a powerful book... Yes. I want to write a book.... powerful book... non-fiction.... or even fiction but  something which is trying to get a point across (for eg. 1984 or Lord of the flies are fiction but they convey a larger  concept).  Yes, that's it.   I'm VERY sleepy.

       Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it, I just want you back for good, whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it, you'll be right and understood, I want you back for good.    - Want you back,  Take That    Album : Nobody Else/Greatest Hits  So what happened to this boy band? I'll tell you...and I'm NOT going to Google on them, I'm just going to rattle off whatever I remember of these guys.  Take That comprised  Gary barlow ,  Robbie Williams ,  Mark Owen ,  Jason orange ,  Howard Donald , and of course,  Robbie Williams . Like all boy bands, they split up after a few hits and cover versions. It was also reported that gary Barlow and Robbie Williams had MAJUH ego hassles :-) To the effect that Robbie called Gary *fat* etc.  After they split, gary Barlow went solo, and gave us songs like Forever love/Love won't wait/So help me girl. Mark Owen also went solo and brought out some songs (i think he had a song called Clementine?). Jason Orange and Howard Donald (the guy with the best body and the Rastafarian hairstyle) disappeared. I once heard Howard was going to play football for Scotland but no updates on that.   Who, then, emerged as the star??  Yes, it was Robbie Williams. And he looked like SUCH a quirk in the take That videos!!! Everyone thought only the tubby Barlow guy would make it, but Robbie outdid them all!  Onto the song now - it's called Want you Back, and has a nice video in black & white with these guys in long coats singing in the rain against a huge car or something. Can't remember anymore, memory does play strange tricks sometimes :-)  Later!

      Last evening I spent some hours studying philosophy. Till some days ago, I never dreamt I would have to, like, STUDY philosophy again (study, not *read*). But I guess that's what life is like - you never can tell!   I remember, before I went to sleep, I was trying to remember the name of this alleged cross-bred animal... between a rabbit and a deer or something. I'm not exactly sure... I had once seen photos... then me and a friend had weaved the Web for more photos... but now I've forgotten what it was.  Jackrabbit? jackalope? Oh what WAS it?   No... can't remember. But it was an interesting thing... of course not caught yet... like the Yeti. Oh whatever.. what am I doing talking of fictional/alleged animals.  So this morning I was thinking about the ideal way to break up and I remembered an episode from Seinfeld where Jerry breaks up with that insipid woman called Rachel. He does it with such a lot of ease and finesse, one day I hope I shall be able to pull of something like it :-)  Here's how it goes.   Rachel : Jerry ... Jerry : Yes? Rachel : I've been doing a lot of thinking. Jerry : Aha? Rachel : Well, I don't think we should see each other any more. Jerry : Oh, that's okay. Rachel : What? Jerry : Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else. Rachel : You will? Jerry : Sure. See, things always even out for me. I'm even Steven! Rachel : Huh? Jerry : It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And ... good luck! Rachel : Yeah, you too.   This blog entry lead me to search for Seinfeld scripts and now I have all the scripts of all the seasons in a zipped file sitting pretty on my desktop. Slurp!

      Last evening I had nothing to do. So I thought "Why don't I read The Allegory of the Cave?" What kind of a person does that, eh?  Yeah. Yeah. I have to facilitate a Philosophy course next month. Take a bunch of 53-yr-olds through discussions, assess their performance, see that their *learning* goes well. And thank god I had a copy at home - my father passed out a copy to me but I didn't read it at that time. Of course that was during the past summer.   So, I was reading that. Alas! Plato is tough reading....   Its from Book VII of The Republic if I am right. Yeah... The Republic. I started it... but I left in after reading a bunch of chapters. Well... I leave ALL the books I read in the middle, then pick them up after MONTHS. But... with The Republic... I didn't really pick it up again. He he :-)   I used to go to Barista and read it while having coffee. At that time it seemed like a smart thing to do. It takes a lot of time for me to digest Plato. I have to read each small passage a couple of times over to get a grasp of what he's saying. So, it goes verrrrrry slooowwwwwww. I like reading it... but its just a little difficult reading.  So, what does that say about my intellectual capacity? eh?  Anyway. One thing I always note in Plato's dialogues is that they all follow incremental reasoning or logic. For example:  if I do it, then this would happen... you agree? Yes... okay... proceeding further... this and this is the next step, agree? Yes... then proceeding further . Basically, doing reasoning at each step... making people agree... then proceeding further.  Actually, that's my preferred way of discussion too. I always chop up my arguments in to a lot of individual pieces... and then have people agree with each of one of them one after the other.... treating incoming arguments piece by piece. And once they agree on one thing... then building on that... since they've already agreed on the preceding arguments.  So... while reading Plato's dialogues... that always poses a problem. Socrates is Socrates, and you become whoever he is talking to. And you have to agree or disagree with what he is saying. And then proceed further. But... what if you don't agree with one of his assertions? That just breaks up the whole argument. Each assertion is based on the acceptance of the preceeding one. When I don't agree with one... then it follows that I cannot agree on the foundation of the next one.   You get what I'm saying?  Of course, its a book. So... that's just something you have to deal with. Its written in only one way. That problem wouldn't be so in live discussions.   Oh well. :-)  I'm out.

      I just realized that there is no effective and sure way of suicide to consider!!! You just cannot kill yourself and be sure that you will. Here's what I thought about the various methods:  1) They talk about slashing your wrist... but that just isn't neat. its messy... and... how would you know where exactly to cut it. Tsk... nope... you could really survive this thing.  2) You can throw yourself in front of a vehicle... but seriously... you'll break your bones and stuff.... you don't know if you'll die.  3) Then... you could jump off a roof... but... how would you get to some high roof? and there's just no high place over here! besides... its scary dude.  4) Deprive yourself of oxygen... how're you gonna do that? err... Water! You can drown yourself. But pesky lifeguards will save you.  5) Oh oh... this is a real scary one... electrocute yourself. uggh... that's too scary dude.  6) Hehe... the air bubble method... but I won't mention that here.  7) Oooh.... poison yourslf.... nuh uh. That's too uncomfy for the body.  Okay that's it! You can't kill yourself. You'll just have to live the life out.

        You are Form 0,  Phoenix : The Eternal.   "And The Phoenix's cycle had reached zenith, so he consumed himself in fire.  He emerged from his own ashes, to be forever immortal."   Some examples of the Phoenix Form are Quetzalcoatl (Aztec), Shiva (Indian), and Ra-Atum (Egyptian). The Phoenix is associated with the concept of life, the number 0, and the element of fire. His sign is the eclipsed sun.  As a member of Form 0, you are a determined individual.  You tend to keep your sense of optomism, even through tough times and have a positive outlook on most situations.  You have a way of looking at going through life as a journey that you can constantly learn from. Phoenixes are the best friends to have because they cheer people up easily.    urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Last night I had a long conversation with someone, and that made me think about what I am looking for and what I want out of a relationship. I know, some people think I write well about relationships, but a disclaimer - I am not too good with handling my own. So, while I can sit for hours and talk to bufuddled people about how to take control of their love lives, I know nada about how to handle my own.   So here are the things I want, and I've elaborated on each with a concrete example:  1)  Peace - I can't take any more of uncertainties and doubts.   For instance, if your mobile phone is switched off, I won't be calling you again and again about what you are upto and I won't work myself into a frenzy. Been there, done that. Even seen friends psyching over "Where is he/she right now and  what is he/she doing/" No, I'm not going to do that, and don't expect the same from you. I might be out of reach sometimes, and that's probably because I want it that way. Don't worry, I'm not philandering, I just need my space.  2)  Stability - I know I can play the game forever, but this time I'm playing for keeps.  No more estranged relationships, no more bitterness. I now believe in minimal damage. While we may get along very well, and establish the connection and all of that, there might still be certain factors that prevent us getting together. Accept them, and move on. I'll try to be friends, but don't mind fuck with me. If it hurts me to be around you, in the knowledge that you are another one of those glorius could-have-beens, I'll well, stay away from you. Nothing I can do about it.    3) Trust - I believe in you, but do you believe in me?  When I say I am late at work, it usually means i AM late at work. If I wanted to see a film with another male friend, I would have told you so in the first place. Please give me some credit here. And you do the same - don't fib to me about client meetings and then have my female friends catch you hanging out at the bar with female/male friends. It hurts. So please, give it to me straight, don't lie. I don't want to be the last one to know.  4)  Communicate - Listen when I talk, and I'll hear you out too.  If you've had a bad day at work, tell me about it, I want to know. I'll even make dart boards out of your boss's face for you to throw little arrows at. I'm around, just talk. But I have a fair share of problems too, and I'll expect that you'll be around when I need to vent.  5)  Commitment - The dreaded C word.   The rules are simple. If you are an emotional fuckwit, get out. I'm ready for commitment, so unless you feel the same way, sorry dude, wrong number :-)  Apart from these, I obviously want someone who is well-read, well-bred, has  a good career graph and immaculate personal hygeine,  and doesn't lech, burp, and scratch his balls in public.

      My parents are leaving today. Going back to the Calcutta cocoon, as I prefer to call it.   How do I feel about it? Errmmm.... Yes I feel a little sad, it was nice having them around, apart from the v. important aspect of getting assured cooked meals :-)   I'm back to my Singleton mode, which basically means entering an empty house (can get depressing at times), and having long-term relationships with cartons of juice in the fridge. It's not funny how MUCH I stack up in the fridge, like a hoarding thing, and then throw them out anyways, because they're, well, not worth consuming anymore.  But also, here are the things I can do:   1) Watch the channels I like - otherwise they would be on NDTV and Aaj Tak practically all the time. Cartoon Network, here i come!!!  2) Talk endlessly on the phone. Yes, this is a subject of much chagrin to both my parents, who view talling-on-the-telephone as mindless and/or sinful. Any conversation that stretches beyond fifteen minutes is anathema. Conversations on the mobile phone are seen as especially venal.  3) Eat Maggi for breakfast and dinner. Gawd, how I missed this one.   4) Put on Radio Mirchi full volume.  Points (5) and (6) I cannot mention here.  SO well dudes, bring out the male strippers and let's GET to work baby, yeah! (to be read in Austin Powers style).

      Some time back, I had written a highly romanticized entry on going home, which ended with the lines -    I miss my home, my city. I always wondered how my life would have turned out had I remained. I do have a very good life now but I still wonder. I miss the sound of the crickets and the dark of the night. The smell of the freshly cut green grass on a warm summer night. Maybe some day we will meet again.    Funny how I never think of Delhi as my home. In my scheme of things, Delhi is still a transit, a  place I need to get away from.  Soon. Too many memories, too much baggage here.  I know I'm getting impatient, I feel I've lingered too long already.  So yes, Calcutta will remain my home.. Delhi, my stopover station.   But I am sad when I go back to Calcutta. I seem to have moved away, leading a totally separate life from the people I grew up with. My cousin sisters - some young mothers now - look at me with pride and a touch of filial jealousy - " You're doing well in life, you're a free bird ." Older brothers give me the " Ok, how many more boyfriends before you tie the knot? " sermon.   I just smile.  Don't grudge me my freedom, you could have made the same choices, I want to tell them.  The last thing I ever wanted to do is lead my life by a template.   I see my friends. The ones who stayed on at university, to complete their Masters and their M Phils. They teach in schools, or work in low-paying vernacular media. They still date the same people, and they still kiss furtively in dark movie theatres.   I don't connect with them anymore.  I still meet them, but I don't know what to talk about.  I really want to reach out.  I can't.   But there's one thing I do each time I visit Calcutta. I go to my university and walk through all the places that I spent three years in. I go to the classrooms and I sit on the benches where we used to sit. I run my hands along the rough wood of the desks. I go to the library, the canteen, the lake... everything.  It's funny how these inanimate things make me feel more at home than the people I knew.  It's my way of connecting with a past I left behind.

      Hmm... la la la. I'm bored. I want to go back to bed.  I was looking at the interview positions at NIIT. I don't qualify for like ...ANYTHING!! I want to drink water. I'll be back. I am back.  I took 15 minutes last night to clean the dishes.  I was washing all the dishes. I had said to myself that I wouldn't go to bed with dirty dishes in the sink. I was keeping my promise to myself. I find that one of the stupid things you can do it break your promises to yourself. I would be fooling myself then. I don't want to fool myself. I therefore washed the dishes. I got my BIG mug with iced water.  I got an email from my ex.  I've organized my Outlook to trash his mails.  So I see it come into my inbox, and then disappear.  I feel bad about it.  I, sometimes, see happy people. I don't like them being happy. I'm not happy... why should they be happy?  I was reading books on Roman history couple of days ago. I read about anything and everything I am curious about. I have read books on how to identify flowers. I have read books on bringing up babies. I have read books on how to talk about sex with your children. I'm a very curious person. I like to absorb as much as I can. I wonder if the mind is like a sponge and whether its too saturated to absorb things at one time.  I once got an email from a friend whom I hadn't heard from in a year, asking what my opinion was on a certain movie. I sent him like a page full of my opinion on the movie, why it was the way it was, and social/cultural causes and effects. I did have an opinion, yeah. I think I'm conceited.  I always and go update my age in online profiles on my birthday. I got my Managerial training assignment back with a 95. I got back the group project with a 90. I was unhappy that we got only a 90 while another girl was happy that we got an 'A.' I think this is getting long.   I'm going to send my father an email. I did.  I'm going now.

       Thanks people for sending these forwards early in the morning. Makes my day or what!!   Women are like apples on trees: the best ones are at the top of the tree. Most men don't want to reach for the good ones because they are afraid of falling and getting hurt.   Instead, they just get the rotten apples from the ground that aren't as good, but easy....... SO the apples at the top think something is wrong with them, when in reality, they're amazing. They just have to wait for the right man to come along - the one who's brave enough to climb all the way to the top of the tree.  Share this with other women who are good apples - even those who have already been picked! And remember ... Men are like a fine wine. They start out as grapes, and it's up to women to stomp the crap out of them until they turn into something acceptable to have dinner with.

      I saw The Sound of Music on VCD over the weekend!!! Initially I was like okay, I'll watch a scene or two while I have my dinner. And I caught another scene or two. And another couple. And then I was like... what the heck, I'll watch the whole thing!  But, it was cut a lot. There were lots of missing parts. Yeah, you can't get Sound of Music past me without me noticing if scenes were missing or not. Why after Independence Day, it is probably my most seen movie (I've seen Independence Day a ridiculous number of times... really! I watched it on HBO daily two years ago:-)).  It was different this time though. First time I saw it, I think I was probably 6 or 7 years old. For instance, I noticed that one of the nuns in the movie who sing the "How do you solve a problem like Maria" song was actually cute. I never noticed that when I was 6 ;-)  Hmm... what else. Oh yes, oh yes! I remember when I used to watch it when I was a child, the oldest two kids used to be very old... adults actually. This time around, they weren't!!!! Liesl was 16 and Friedrich was 14. I could have sworn they were a lot older when I was young. They were kids this time around!!!  Then, I wasn't really interested in the Liesl-Rolfe story then as well as their song. This time around it was better.   And of course, the whole Austria-Germany aspect. I didn't get that a lot when I was young. I remember my father explained to me that he (the Captain) didn't want to fight and that's why the Germans were after him. And I was like... doesn't want to fight, what do you mean doesn't want to fight? And why doesn't he like Germany?  Acutally, there were two scenes in the movie that I don't remember seeing ever. Either I was too disinterested, or they were cut in our copy of the tape. But apart from that, I could tell at each place where they cut scenes. Why they totally left off the strawberries-turned-blue scene! And the marriage... the church... the song... gone... poof!  Of course, my favourite song from the film is the Peggy Wood version of Climb Every Mountain. And only two weeks ago, I was singing Edelweiss in the morning for no rhyme or reason.   Watching Sound of Music makes me happy... no kidding. I feel like a kid again.  btw, Vanya doesn't share my enthusiasm for sound of music. She wished - and I quote - "the hills were no longer alive, the whiskers had somehow fallen off the kittens, and for the deaths of a couple kids."   Tsk Tsk!!!! ;-)))

      alright... now look at this recipe:  Poached Eggs - Recipe courtesy Sara Moulton  Water 1 tablespoon vinegar 4 eggs  Heat 2 to 3 inches of water in a large saucepan over medium heat until almost boiling. Add vinegar. Crack eggs into 4 small cups and slide one by one from the cup into the simmering water. Maintain the water just below a simmer, reducing the heat to low if necessary. Cook until the whites are set and the centers are still soft.  ---  Hmm... now look: you break the eggs into cups. OK. Then you pour them into simmering water. This doesn't make sense. I mean... in water? I mean... wouldn't the egg-white *dissolve* in water? like... as in... you know... one liquid merging with another liquid?   Ms. Moulton... this DOESN't make sense!  Now I understand that the viscosity of two liquids will govern whether or not they will remain separated... as in oil and water. They don't mix. But, I'm pretty sure that egg-white and water will.  Tsk. Now curiousity is bugging me. They will force me to waste an egg. But if anything goes wrong, I'm blaming Ms. Moulton :-)

      So after a lot of help from Surinder and transferring copious code over MSN and Yahoo, I managed to change my blog template. And created a smart (I think!) profile on Blogger - something I've been wanting to do for a very long time now.  You guys are still probably wondering how Aseem Bajaj figures into all of this. Here's how: I mail him at 3.37, assuming he would be asleep, and here is what I write:   Asm,  I changed everything on my blog. And I especially want to know what  YOU think of the changes.  So tell me!    Dude writes back in two minutes:   Hey Resh,   A few things  1. The boxes and the shapes on the blog look good, rather cool.  2. The colors (brown) is someone how unlike you, choose something groovy.  3. A minor thing, the link for the "comment" that you inserted in  there is sticking to the left margin, you might wanna give some space  there. And you know what, now that you have shifted to new  blogger.com, you can enable comments that itself.  4. You profile looks good, but I was expecting your pic. Also put in  the rest of the details as well. Don't spend time thinking, put in  stuff from orkut :)  5. I like that you are back to your original title.   :)   Have fun  -Aseem    Hmm, so that is what I call a megacool guy! And THIS is what I call a soopah-cool blog! Mood: Elated.

      Sometimes, I ask myself "Am I a good person?" I, immediately get the picture of Jerry Seinfeld thinking "I am a good person" while sitting in Babu's restaurant - if anybody's seen that episode.  So what do I care how I am? Hmmm... I do, I really do. Of course most of the time I think I am. But sometimes I have the thought "No... stop, dreaming. You're not. You only wish you were."   Does it matter? Oh I don't know - I guess it matters in some form or the other. If I'm thinking about it. I'd like to know that what I do(or did) was correct.   I even have a book " How good people make difficult decisions ." Hehe. Not that I'm expecting to be in a position where I have to choose between a guy being burned alive or me shooting him to kill him before he's burnt alive (example in the book).   Hehe... nah... I'm kidding. I got that book just because it was interesting... a guide on ethics.  Anyways, so when I was walking back last evening, I was thinking - as you ARE supposed to be doing when you're alone, right?   And I recalled that I hadn't sent somebody a birthday card (I didn't know the date really), and I didn't wish somebody good luck for something (even though I had the chance)... and I said to myself 'Hey, you don't do the little things that count.'   Quite often I see that I do things in a balance-sheet kind of way. Like if somebody doesn't do something for me, I don't return the gesture.   But that's not was being good is about. That's an accountant or something.   Sometimes, I think what would happen if I died and were to be judged by God of my deeds (not that I have any proof that this goes on). Where would the scales tip to?    Have I done more right? or Have I done more wrong?   And I know these are more or less two different things I have mixed over here. Being a 'nice' person is different from being a 'good' person.   So a 'nice' person? Oh I don't know. I suspect that I might not be able to make that cut. A 'good' person? Ummm... I don't know. I hope so. I mean otherwise... things need to be changed. Because I am definite I don't want to be a 'bad' person.  Wouldn't it be much easier if there was a good-and-bad-o-meter we could measure ourselves in? It could tell you 'you need 8 more points to bring yourself up to the mark' or something like that ;-)

      Alright... I think now I can write my sulking-in-misery entry. Something always seems to come up.... if not then some stupid politicians or companies are doing something stupid and I have to write entries on them.  I got this coffee... I'm drinking it. bah. I hate coffee. Anyways... so like I was saying... I don't really have a life. I'm sitting here drinking coffee and writing a blog entry. Who the hell does that?  I don't have any friends. I won't make any friends. I'm telling you I'm going to die alone.   When I was in school, once there was an inter-school competition... and one of the topics for the essay competition was "I alone in a world I never made." I think its from some poem. But anyhow... that's the story of my life. This is just not my world. I don't think my world exists. I am living alone in other peoples' world. I want out, really.  I don't see any point to this whole damn life. You go to school for like 15 years everyday. Then you slog in college in a routine for about 6-8 years. Then you slog in a routine doing "work" for the next 40 years. Then you die. I mean... what am I doing here? I mean... I'm drinking coffee (and it doesn't even taste that good). Is that what I'm supposed to be doing? Cuz... that's what I'm doing.  And I'm sitting here. And I'll just keep sitting here... becuase I don't really have anything better to do. I don't even know anyone. Bah. Some day I'll die in this misery. Alone. Maybe I should do something. But there's nothing.  I think I should go get a job in some big city. I don't like living in Delhi-ville. And... and... I want to live in some place that has a freakin subway system. But no... that won't happen. I'm stuck here. So... the future is grim.  Everything is grim. And that is why I had to write a sulking-in-misery entry. No friends, no lovelife, no life in general. I'm feeling dizzy. why's that? I'm gonna sue these Georgia people if it was the coffee.  I don't even know what I want to do for an ideal job. I'm just kind of stuck in between. My life is in a mess.  Now... back to sulking-in-misery. Hmm... I can't find more things to say. So maybe I can re-iterate the same things. I think I should establish a weekly sulking-in-misery entry. I should also become a motivational speaker... as stupid as it sounds right now. Ex used to say I should become a counsellor or motivational speaker or something. Yeah... I'll do that. I'm really good at it. Except that I also like to sulk-in-misery in the privacy of my room.... the part that no one sees.  Bah... its a jumbled up world. I want to learn how to play some musical instrument. I want to learn how to sing. I want to do things that I like.  That's it for the sulking-in-misery entry. Tune in again for more misery same time same channel.   Btw, my winamp is playing Hole in my Soul by Aerosmith. Totally fits my mood.   There’s a hole in my soul that’s been killing me forever It’s a place where a garden never grows There’s a hole in my soul, yeah I should have known better ’Cause your love’s like a thorn without a rose

      This morning when I opened the rolled up newspaper from my balcony, I smiled what I think was one of my most cynical smiles so far. Imran Khan and Jemima (Haiqa) Goldsmith-Khan are headed for Splitsville. Imran has publicly announced that they are already divorced and Jemima has been spotted arm-in-arm in several nightclubs in London with none other than Britain's best export, Hugh Grant!  Ok so another one bites the dust. What a big deal they made out of the marriage. Imran, after years of sowing his wild oats and fathering children in every continent, settled for the heiress of the famous Goldsmith family, and Jemima was the fresh-as-a-flower nubile British semi-princess. The media speculated whether Jemima would be able to stand the Pakistani food and weather; but she went ahead, changed her name and religion, and settled down in marital bliss.  *sigh* ---------------------  It's my friend's birthday in July. And already I'm wondering what to get him.   Hmm, so ahh ... what can I get him for less than 500 bucks? :-) I remember the year before last I gave him something... about 200 bucks' worth. And last year, we weren't talking, we'd had a major fight :-) But that's over now, and we're on talking terms, and that means I need to give him something. Hmm, it'd have to be one of those colognes. I love to give colognes and perfumes. If anybody asks me what to give people, or if I ask myself that... I point them to perfumes. I have a huge weakness for perfume/cologne things, and yes, fragrances are usually my standard gift to anybody.   No wonder, when I got gifts from him and his girlfriend  I got... guess what? :-) Yup. Drakkar Noir. They both know I love men's perfumes, and they both know I love Drakkar Noir. Spicy smell. Verryyy nice.   Actually that, and err... Obsession by Calvin Klien. Obsession ROCKS!!!! And yyyeeesss, Kouros by Yves St laurent. That is THE thing really. But a 150 ml vial comes for Rs 2800, so unless the guy is REALLY special to me, I would not go buying Kouros randomly :-)  Actually come to think of it, I've never gifted Kouros to anyone yet! So either I haven't met the Kouros guy of my life, or well, I'm just a miser!  On the other hand, I also love CK One. It's from the opposite side. Instead of spicy, it's lemony/citrusy. But it's light  - which is good. Unlike Armani. Of course, as far as things for Armani go, it is my personal opinion that you could pass off any toilet cleaner for an Armani deo. Too much lemony smells in Armani's stuff.  -------------------------------------  I have realized that two working people cannot be in a successful relationship. They just don't have enough time for each other.   Amen.

      After a long time I fished out  Come Undone , my favourite  Duran Duran  song, followed closely by  Hungry like the Wolf . Sometimes I do that, you know, go back in music history and listen to the big 80's bands. Maybe it's because they were my initiation into the world of English music - bands such as  Duran Duran  and  Depeche Mode  and  Genesis  - who you only get to see nowadays on MTV Rewind shows :-)  Am I off the mark if I say that Duran Duran was the original boy band, teen idols who wrote and played their own songs? They were definitely the first to create elaborate music videos that ran like mini-movies (think of their James Bond theme for  A View to Kill  with Simon le Bon on the Eiffel Tower or  Hungry like the wolf , which was a small adventure film in itself!). I was searching on the Net for a visual of  Come Undone , but can't seem to find any screenshots! Anyways, here are the lyrics.   Mine, immaculate dream made breath and skin I've been waiting for you Signed, with a home tattoo, Happy birthday to you was created for you (can't ever keep from falling apart At the seams Can't I believe you're taking my heart To pieces) Oh, it'll take a little time, Might take a little crime To come undone now We'll try to stay blind To the hope and fear outside Hey child, stay wilder than the wind And blow me in to cry Who do you need, who do you love When you come undone Words, playing me deja vu Like a radio tune I swear I've heard before Chill, is it something real Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers Lost, in a snow filled sky, we'll make it alright To come undone now.

      I'm going to make Kung Pao chicken today. Hmm... let's see if we get anywhere near the real thing :-)  You know, I really should, consdiering that I'll be using readymade sauce. All I'll be doing is mixing the stuff, so... you know... it shouldn't be a disaster. But I can't really say. I had done some sort of stir-fry last week, and I didn't like it. Not that it was bad, it's just that I didn't like it. It was kind of sweet... which is ridiculous. Hehe... it just occured to me whether that it could have been the mixture for Sweet & Sour chicken.   Nah!   I got chicken, stir-fry vegetables (not required for this particular thing... for a later date), peanuts (required), and onions (required). Actually, I got only one onion. It's big. But the recipe on the mixture calls for 4 onions. There's no way I'm going to put 4 onions in my kung pao chicken.   Hehehe... maybe this is what makes recipes go wrong for me! If ever I see something I don't like or I don't have, it doesn't go into the food! *grin*  Anyways... this reminded me of the Teriyaki chicken I had once. Jeezus Christ! That was amazing! My friend took me to this Japanese place in Bangalore and I've never had anything like that again. Hehe... one thing unusual I noticed there was that they didn't provide knives/forks, etc. Just chopsticks... which was NOT ok by me - I can't work them very easily. So we had to specially ask them for a fork. hehe.

      Yesterday, as I was going to a restaurant for lunch, I saw a little girl step out of a car. Her short height, made the step from the vehicle to the ground appear much bigger. I couldn't help smiling at the little girl.  Often I think about it... little children... soon they'll be grown-ups. I think of myself... I feel the same as I ever did. It's me. It's the same me that was 10 years ago ... or 15 years ago when I was 11. And I'll be the same person 20 years hence.  If I'm still alive at that point.    It's kind of amazing - the bodies age and grow old - but in our minds, we always feel ourselves. And you tell yourself ' See what you may in the mirror... but, I'm still that same person '.  It also seems like a very grand scheme of life. Little kids grow into adults and then die, and newer kids come and turn into adults... and they die... and yet another generation comes forth. People come and go, but life goes on. The show always goes on.  So, whenever I see little children, I always smile, thinking of this - That in 10-15 years, they'll be me, looking at some other kid. And I'll be somebody else too, looking at other 26 year olds and thinking ' kids... soon they'll grow up .'  It's weird, this cycle, but it always fascinates me. The world keeps going on. Individual people have their lives, their little worlds, their stories that go along. They come and they go... but life moves forth.  I really like this poem:   I AM the people—the mob—the crowd—the mass.  Do you know that all the great work of the world is done through me?  I am the workingman, the inventor, the maker of the world’s food and clothes.  I am the audience that witnesses history. The Napoleons come from me and the Lincolns. They die. And then I send forth more Napoleons and Lincolns.  I am the seed ground. I am a prairie that will stand for much plowing. Terrible storms pass over me. I forget. The best of me is sucked out and wasted. I forget. Everything but Death comes to me and makes me work and give up what I have. And I forget.  Sometimes I growl, shake myself and spatter a few red drops for history to remember. Then—I forget.  When I, the People, learn to remember, when I, the People, use the lessons of yesterday and no longer forget who robbed me last year, who played me for a fool—then there will be no speaker in all the world say the name: “The People,” with any fleck of a sneer in his voice or any far-off smile of derision.  The mob—the crowd—the mass—will arrive then.    In particular... I think the line " I am the audience that witnesses history. The Napoleons come from me and the Lincolns. They die. And then I send forth more Napoleons and Lincolns " is very true. People die... and more people come. Life goes on.  Yeah... that's why I always smile when I see children. They're the future. Some great people probably in them... the ones for whom the step down to the ground from a car is too big.... these little men and women.

      It's a really hard thing to say if you think about it.    "I hope it doesn't happen here."    Sure, if a plane has to be hijacked, I hope it's not mine. If a bomb has to blow, I hope it's elsewhere. If a car accident has to happen, I hope it doesn't involve me.  Those are easy things for me to say. Those are the things I wish for. I don't really have any problems wishing for my well being. But then you have to consider that its implication is that it should happen elsewhere, on somebody else's plane, to somebody else's car.  In effect what it comes down to is:  "Take them. Not me."   You saw this situation in 1984. Wilson and his girlfriend both were coerced into offering each other as price for their own safety. I'd love to quote something but I don't have the book right now. Wait... *grins mischeviously*. Forget it... my ebook-reader is not working.  *back some time later*  So where were we? Yes, we are at wishing good for us; which means bad for others. So take a mother who has a sick child who needs a heart transplant. She wishes that she gets a heart. In that wish, she has also wished that another mother somewhere lose her child - give away those last breaths and hope.  What do you make of this? So that we might be safe, somebody else should bear the misfortune. Tempting to say: we're humans, not perfect. But I don't like to do that. I wrote an entry once something called "We Humans: imperfect, flawed beings." I don't think it is here in this blog. But what I said in that was that everytime something happens, people pin it down on their genes.   I guess it is a by-product wish. Negative externality of the good we want to happen. But yet, it's interesting to think about it.   We do wish that nothing happens where we are or where family members are but deep in there it means " Take somebody else; not me. "

      Why is it, that the most heart-crushing thoughts come to you and catch you by the throat unawares. I'm sitting in office on a Saturday, and I have to come here tomorrow as well, and if that wasn't enough, I put on Boyzone's song  Father & Son . And suddenly, I'm hit by how much I'm missing my own father. It's true, I've been a little impatient with him of late, snapped at him more often, and hated myself for it later on. Damn, I want to see him right now.   ***  It's not time to make a change just relax - take it easy You're still young - that's your fault there's so much you have to know Find a girl, settle down if you want, you can marry Look at me - I am old but I'm happy  I was once like you are now and I know that it's not easy To become when you've found something going on But take your time - think a lot think of everthing you've got For you will still be here tomorrow ...But your dreams may not...  ***  God, I'm getting back to work. Right now. I'll see him in July.

      Was just listening to the Latino folder of my MP3 collection, and for the first time, I paid attention to the lyrics of a certain Enrique Iglesias song. Am I the only one who thinks this is funny? Check out the lyrics, especially the highlighted part.       I don't have to tell you what this is all about 'Cause baby half the fun is in us figuring it all out  So why you gotta ask me What I'm doing now 'Cause I don't like to question What I still haven't found  So don't turn off the lights I don't wanna be In the dark tonight  'Cause I can't read your mind I need to know if what I'm doing is right.

      Saw this ad in an online magazine "  Are you young, handsome, smart, good teeth  ?" in bold. Then smaller print " Donate your sperm to a couple in need... yadda yadda yadda "  I don't know... I really don't like this business of selecting the physical features of sperm givers. Good Teeth?  And this is nothing. Sperm banks have dossiers on sperm donors... photos, majors, grades in school, activities.... god knows all kind of information... so that they might select only the best (ivy league grads' sperms are most sought after) for their dear child.  First of all... beggars shouldn't be choosers anyways. Ahh... touching... "couple in need" indeed!  Why don't they append the right words after that "...  Want to create a superior child following Darwins's theory... for that they need only the best of the build, intellect, beauty, strength, found in people ."  There should be only record of being free from diseases, disorders and the sort. And as far as physical features go... I suppose they should mention the race of the donor... for obvious reasons.... so that people will actually keep the children and the children will adjust properly without being stared at.

      What do you say to somebody if you don't think that their new child is the cutest thing?  I mean... I saw a kid today. And while I thought that the child is kind of decently okay looking, it just didn't strike that chord that makes me go 'ohhh... how cuuuute/adoooooorable, etc. etc.'  Thankfully, I was surrounded by a lot of people who were gushing about the baby. But, I should really be prepared for such a situation when I'm alone. I mean... what if I see someone's new baby in reality? What am I supposed to say if I think the baby is okay-looking?  "She's just like her mother." "He's just like his father." That should get you off the hook. hehe.  There was a Seinfeld episode where the four of them had gone to see someone's baby and it looked real ugly to them. Hehe... that was kind of fun.... because the baby's doctor called Elaine breathtaking. Then later he called the baby breath-taking.  Once I was reading this book called "Web Pages That Suck." It teaches you good design by showing you bad design. It said that you can call people's children ugly, but you can't call people's webpages ugly. People are senstive about their webpages. ;-)

      Over the past couple of days, I have been thinking about "letting go." No, not as in psycho-stalking your ex-girlfriend. It's more about control.... about losing control.  Now why would anybody want to lose control? Hmmm. That's an interesting thing. I don't know... I just think that it would bring some sort of.... err... free feeling.   How did these thoughts come about? Well... basically, long time back I had seen an e-card which depicted a girl (or was it a guy) leaning like the Leaning Tower and somebody on somebody else... and the caption was something to the order of "  lean on me  ." See.... that's kind of losing control... in that case you let somebody else worry, etc.  It's also a trust building exercise I believe. Like one person is blindfolded... and the other person has to guide this blindfolded person around... outside... over slopes/grass/rocks etc. The catch is that you cannot talk. You are allowed to devise signals like tapping on shoulder, abdomen, etc... and have it stand for whatever you want (left, right, uphill, downhill, etc). And then the blindfolded person is totally in the other person's hands.... you're guiding them... and they're counting totally on you to not have them fall down in a ditch.  Another thing... umm... it was this movie. Err... it had this guy... who girls like.... whatisname... err... Okay hold on... let me look up from imdb.com. Though what am I supposed to look up? I don't remember either the movie or the actor names! Got it... err... John Cusack. Anyway... so in the end of the movie, John Cusack asks Bill Bob Thorton to help him... you know... get his life back on track. And BBT asks him to let go. John Cusack is like... What? BBT takes Cusack to a river... and says '  Jump. Just let go of yourself.  '   That's exactly what I'm talking about. And I was really thinking in the most simple terms. Like when did I reliquish control of myself?   I think it's a part of growing up/ageing. You take more control... everything is about having control.... about being in control. But I think... you should just kind of... periodically let go of control. Yeah... like... Bungee jumping, or sky diving or something. Yeah! Relinquish all control of yourself. I mean... I'm not saying you have to go kill yourself... but you know...   Do you get what I'm saying?   Of course, drugs are also a letting go mechanism. But that's a very very bad mechanism. It's not positive. It should be physical, not chemical.  I'm telling ya... some guy's probably making millions of bucks putting this very same advice in a book. But people won't give ME the million bucks for doing the same thing. Tsk tsk.   People keep telling me I should become a counsellor. Yeah... I'd probably be real good at that kind of stuff. But, I'm stuck here. And people don't want to hire me anyway. I need a career change.

      All of a sudden, for the past two days, I have been overcome with terrible bouts of exhaustion. Bone dead exhaustion. Last evening, I went home, and just slept off, and only got up when my mother called me around eight thirty. And when I woke up, it was all dark, and I hadn't switched the lights on, so I could not figure out what time or date it was, for a few seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. Wonder why I'm feeling so drained...  Nice weather this morning. It was drizzling when I came. Although in Calcutta I hear it's been raining for the past three days. God, how I miss the coastal rains. That's why I've chosen to go home in July - when the monsoons will be on full swing. I need to see rain, I miss it too much.   Ranjith called last night. He is in Thrissur for 10 days. So we were like - Woh, we're in the same COUNTRY now at least! Again I put myself up for adoption, and again he said he would need time to think about it :-)   Finally, I think I need a new job. Everyone around is getting a new job. SS landed a stint with Macromedia in Bangalore. AK got Ernst & Young. And me? I can't just sit around and wait to be a fossil in NIIT.  Sometimes I look at the people here and see the ones who've stuck around this place for ten-eleven years. I just can't see myself devoting so much of my life to just ONE place. Besides, I need more money. By next year I should have bought my own car and/or got myself a month's holiday and go see UK again. I'm stagnating here :-(  My ideal job would of course be sitting in a beach-house type set-up and typing short stories while I sip ginger ale and thoughtfully light up a mauve cigarette, but until that happens, I could do with a corporate job that pays me more and gives me a laptop :-)

      June 16 - the birthday of a very special person in my life -  Vivek Sharma . My first boss, mentor, and now, a very good friend. I remember when I first came to Delhi, he and his wife Bhavana were like my surrogate parents who would listen me out wile I just howled on about being homesick. Gosh I was 21 then, so I mean, hey, that's alright! And even when I had the DTC accident and my rib cracked? And those horrifying nose-bleeds during my first summer in Delhi? God, they really looked after me then.   While I was with S, Vivek disapproved of him just the way perhaps my father would - he would tell me stuff like - " Reshma, you're intelligent, why are you wasting your time with him? You should find someone more cerebral, someone more your TYPE! " And then he would just nod his shaved head and foot-long beard and say, " WHAT are you doing with your life girl... "   *sigh* :-)  So well yes, I'm glad I met Vivek  Sharma. And I'm glad I'm still friends with him and can spend a weekend in their Friends Colony home (which incidentally is like a Heritage hotel, so please visit when you have the time :-)).  And thanks also to Vivek for taking me to the smoke-filled portals of the Press Club, and the green pea soup and the fried chicken wings of the Foreign Correspondents' Press Club, and thanks to him for choosing to dance with me on the disco floor on his birthday, and thanks for sharing the vodka swigs and the cigarettes when Bhavana wasn't watching :-D  Here's a mail I received from him ages ago, when I had written to him about my professional insecurities, and whether he thought I 'had it in me.'  I'm not much of a e-mail storing type person, but somehow I've managed to hold onto this, because it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy :-)   Reshma  YOU ARE A NUTCASE....believe you me. OK, should I tell you something.... you are among my best FINDS. When I took you, I did not have major expectations from you - actually only minimal. I thaut, here is a kid - can do the kids stuff (genX) but you are doing so well. I do not expect you to have the perspective that perhaps Punnen has (but you have other strengths), the felicity fr words & those beautiful thots & the spontanity...that I am soon going to use. don't you worry.  hey next time you think the way u did last night, just come & talk to me - call me in the middle of the night. Ok, I have a booming voice (but damnit am a chicken inside)  I wish I had your phone #, would have called to clarify right away.  Regarding your piece most first literary works are auto-biographical. Yes, it is well within your rights to amend it, sure go ahead. Tho if you want to you might let me (actually Bhavana is better) read the draft.  Am leaving office early tonight. Since I wouldn't be meeting you hence this mail.  Reshma, I have only one thing to say. Life can be as simple or  complicated one makes it. Communication is a fantastic life-simplifying tool. Say your mind & the world knows it. If you didn't your thots would be lost. Say as much as you can and the air around you would be clear.  Next time you might have some nagging thots (any time of the day/night - anykind - even personal - treat me like you would a friend - maybe an old man friend)- talk to me.   changa west bishes vivek

      I heard this song when I was in class five, or maybe even earlier. And got kind of hooked to it. Then, when we started getting MTV, I saw the video, and liked it even better. Today I learned that the song is written from the POV of a child abuse victim.    My name is Luka I live on the second floor I live upstairs from you Yes I think you've seen me before If you hear something late at night Some kind of trouble. some kind of fight Just don't ask me what it was Just don't ask me what it was Just don't ask me what it was  I think it's because I'm clumsy I try not to talk too loud Maybe it's because I'm crazy I try not to act too proud They only hit until you cry And after that you don't ask why You just don't argue anymore You just don't argue anymore You just don't argue anymore  Yes I think I'm okay I walked into the door again Well, if you ask that's what I'll say And it's not your business anyway I guess I'd like to be alone With nothing broken, nothing thrown Just don't ask me how I am  Just don't ask me how I am...

      Of course, the song is Unsent, by Alanis, but it's all falling into this divine jigsaw puzzle of my own life. Very very uncanny.   dear ******** I like you a lot  I realize you're in a relationship with someone right now and I respect that I would like you to know that if you're ever single in the future and you want to come visit me in ******* I would be open to spending time with you and finding out how old you were when you wrote your first song.   dear ****** I liked you too much I used to be attracted to boys who would lie to me and think solely about themselves and you were plenty self-destructive for my taste at the time I used to say the more tragic the better the truth is whenever I think of the early 90's your face comes up with a vengeance like it was yesterday.   dear ***** I love you muchly you've been nothing but open hearted and emotionally available and supportive and nurturing and consummately there for me I kept drawing you in and pushing  you away I remember how beautiful it was to fall asleep on your couch and cry in front of you for the first time you were the best platform from which to jump beyond myself what was wrong with me   dear ***** you rocked my world you had a charismatic way about you with the women and you got me  seriously thinking about spirituality and you wouldn't let me get away with kicking my own ass but I could never really feel relaxed and looked out for around you though and that stopped us from going any further than we did and it's kinda too bad because we could've had much more fun.   dear ****** we learned so much I realize we won't be able to talk for some time and I understand that as I do you the long distance thing was the hardest and we did as well as we could we were  together during a very tumultuous time in our lives I will always have your back and be curious about you about your career your whereabouts...

      What's the deal with  Monsters Inc . making 62 million dollars over one weekend? Geez... talk about kiddie-power.  Personally, I don't think much of kiddie movies. I mean... not that I don't care for the content, but it is just a blatant attempt at making money. There's absolutely no other reason to make a kiddie-movie other than to make money.  Yeah what's the deal with Arnold Whatever-negger.  Kindergarten Cop .  Jingles All the Way . Why doesn't he just stick to beating the life out of anything that moves? It's money. Just money. They're capitalizing on poor kids. Not as in poor poor, but you know... poor.  Now one could say that in any movie, money is the ultimate motive. Yeah... true. that's true for everything in the world. I mean... even doctors and teachers ultimately are making money. But sometimes, there is just some subject being tackled in a movie. Though there are movies aplenty that don't tackle anything. They're entertainment movies made for earning money. And there's nothing wrong with that. But to do that with children is sneaky. Because children don't know what's what. They're being fooled into watching those movies. I mean... what does it take? 20 kids throwing snow balls at each other. there's a movie. Fork over 8 bucks. (OK, I'm talking about REAL movies here... not animation).   Look at  Home Alone . What was the deal with all the  Home Alone  movies? Geez... it's just mindless meaningless NOTHING! And now, take  Sound of Music . That was a good movie. It taught you how to sing. Do Re Me fa so la ti. But it doesn't mean anything. So, we put in words.   When you know the words to sing, you can sing most anything! Do, a deer, a female deer. Re, a drop of golden sun. Me, a name I call myself. Fa - a long long way to run. So, a needle putting thread. La, a note to follow so. Ti - a drink with jam and bread. That will bring us back to do.. ooo ooooo.   Okay... we're getting carried away here. Seen  Sound of Music  too many times.   Compare that with  Home Alone ... and it teaches you... I don't know... how to assault adult men with items found in and around your home... or something like that.  Then... there was  Shrek .... telling you that looks don't mean anything. I mean... have you ever seen a movie propagating a more blatant lie? :-)))  Anyways... so, in conclusion, these guys should refrain from making movies that children will see and not know that they're being used. They should make movies for adults who will see them and know that they're being used.

      I remember reading once that American men were breasts-men and European men were ass-men.   The central point anyway is attraction to skin. Now, think about it. What is it that makes skin on one part of the body more attractive than another part? I mean... it's just skin! There's skin on the arms.... why should skin on the breasts be any more attractive?  Yeah, every now and then I wonder about this. What is it that drives this? I mean... there's skin on the back of the hand! I thought see people going ga-ga over hands. But breasts are different. Everybody knows that. But why? I don't see a reason why. It's just another part of the body! Skin here, skin there.  Yeah I know of the Freudian thing - that female breasts are associated with motherhood, and that men have this subconscious thing about their mothers suckling them. So, the breasts actually serve a dual purpose of nurture and erotica.   But still, I mean, I just have no idea. Somebody please explain this to me!

      I've been reading this diary on OD. Practically, every entry is about how the guy cannot get girls. And the idiot keeps making pages about what a loser he is.  Yeah, sure dude, keep re-inforcing the notion. It does a lot of good!   You know... I don't get these people. No... actually... I DO get these people. They don't feel secure without having a girlfriend/boyfriend.  The other thing I find so amusing is how people refer to themselves as "nice guy." No telling how many times I have read "I'm not a player, I'm a nice guy. Yet I don't get any girls." Yeah well... everybody can call themself a nice guy. Once I even saw a website about nice guys who can't find girls. What loonies.  Oh there was this other diary I used to read. That was also something! It was as if this guy was obsessed with this girl. He used to post emails he sent to her, and general rants about how his life didn't mean anything. The girl didn't want to be with him (and went to some carribean island to live). Once she mentioned that she was going to be at some US airport (Miami?) to change planes, and this guy flew across the US to catch her so that he could convince her to re-couple up with him.   No, sir... not romantic. More lunatic. If someone doesn't want to be with you, get the message already! You don't have to keep stalking them.   I had a real gem of a comment the other day: " You will get what you pursue ."   Relevance to this entry? Well it goes out to all the people complaining about their partners. Heh... they want nice caring partners... but ask them how/why they picked them, and their answer would be... "they were soooo cuuuuuuute."  Pursue cuteness. Get cuteness.  Pursue beauty. Get Beauty.   It's Zen.   What's there to complain about when you got what you were looking for?   And I'm not even saying that one shouldn't go for looks/beauty. Personally, I think it's fair game. It's a characteristic like any other. And like integrity can suggest character, a good physique can suggest habits.   Bottomline is - You should KNOW what you want. And what you are pursuing NOW.  There's a difference between the two. Make sense?

      I was in the kitchen... the TV was on.... I heard something to the order of " We won't let anyone take out freedom away ..." I expected.... actually... I don't know what I expected. What I didn't expect was  Chevrolet  peddling it's car and "low interest rates" under the guise of patriotism.  Have you noticed... advertisements don't sell anything on their own merits? No, they don't.  Usually they are selling something else. And they conveniently insert their product in the picture. What they usually sell are values, virtues, etc. A mother caring for a sick child. Very motherly. A father coming back and taking his little daughter into his arms. Very nice. Insert any number of products in there from pheneol to cornflakes.  That other car ad... about the woman driving some sportscar... that's selling equality. Certainly nothing to do with the car.  Often enough the guise is love.... which usually ends up suggesting that if you're not using our product... you don't love that person.  These people make me sick.

      I swapped a number of emails with my cousin sister (classical techno-phobe) over the past few days to help her with buying a scanner. Her last email totally cracked me up... and I thought... hey let me post the conversation up here.   Here it is!   me:  Doy ou have USB ports in your computer? I'm not sure if you do or do not. Go to this page:  http://www.howstuffworks.com/usb.htm. In the middle of the page, there is a photo of a USB port. See if your computer has a port that looks like that. ---  her:  hunh? why do I need usb, for whatever it is...tried taking a peek at back of computer...nothin' really made sense. ---  me:  Well... the scanner that were on the page you send me plugged into USB ports on the computer. USB ports are relatively new and didn't come on older computers. You need to be sure that you have USB ports on your computer before you buy a scanner that plugs into a USB port.  Otherwise you'll have a scanner but nowhere to plug it in! ---  her:  aaargh!!! now I have to buy a new computer so that i can buy a scanner so that I can scan my pretty pictures...why does it all has to be so difficult... ---  me:  not neccessarily. You could possibly already have them... . just look behind the computer. They're totally different from all the other ones. They won't have pins sticking out or little holes for sticking pins in (those are called male and female ports... technical term). They'll be rectangular in shape... and I already sent you a link with a picture. Though you could probably get a scanner with a paralell port interface... but... err... is your parallel port being used? Do you have a printer? ---  her:  the entire tech community is pervert.

      The other day, I was talking to someone and to get a point across, I said "Do what you feel here" while knocking with my finger on the person's body where the heart is.  Then I thought, I mean, what's the deal here?   What *I* wanna know how in the world did the heart get involved in all kinds of feelings and love and what not!!!!????? I mean... there's no thinking going on there!!!  You hear everybody saying "Do what your heart says," "What does your heart feel?" "Listen to your heart." Well... if you do that... you're gonna hear: lub dub...... lub dub...... lub dub..... lub dub.... lub dub..... lub dub..... lub dub..... lub dub. You get the idea.  That's all. Lub dub. That's it.  Now somebody please explain to me how lub dub transformed into all sorts of weird things!  I mean... you have your brain where you do all your thinking. SOMEHOW, some only some of the thoughts are attributed to the brain... and other... to the "heart." Why?  You gotta understand... it's one thing doing the thinking. But... no. People make it out to be some sort of CIVIL WAR going on inside the body. You have the evil axis power called the brain... and the other allies with "the heart."  Erm...another thing... if there's one phrase in the world that is an oxymoron.... it's "CIVIL WAR."  :-p

         I watched  Hum Tum  yesterday. All you Saif Ali Khan critics should basically open your big mouths and shove your flat feet into it. For all his goofiness, this guy is clearly DA MAN! And was I surprised to see Abhishek Bachchan in a cameo?!?!  So there we were, sitting and munching on popcorn, and there was this girl sitting next to me, and she had clearly come to see the film alone, and looked kind of intelligent, so we actually got talking! I mean all the while, it was like she could be any other friend of mine, and we would like, collectively draw our breaths in when Saif Ali Khan was   1) barebodied 2) getting wet in the rain 3) getting close to Rani Mukherjee 4) All of the above  and we would laugh at the jokes together and stuff. During the intermission, we even spoke at length about Saif's transition from his  Aashique Awaara  days. Yeah, so I pretty much enjoyed her company. When she left, I was debating whether I should ask her name/take her telephone number, but then, I figured she would think I'm a stalker or a psycho and I just let it be. Also, the guy I went with would think I'm a sick homo and probably just never want to meet me again.  Yeah, I mean, that's just the kind of warmth I exude. I can totally make friends with strangers in dark movie halls... not a problem there, not a problem at all :-)  Peace and respect to Saif da man!

      Hmm, so recently I see a lot of kids rediscovering the song Gin-Soaked boy by The Divine Comedy. In the online community I frequently haunt, several people have pasted whole verses of this song in the place they're asked to describe themselves, like a  Contradiction-is-Cool  thing.  What they perhaps don't know is that these lyrics are made up entirely of names of horses that run in the Derby. Apparently, the band members of Divine Comedy sat down to write a song one day, and were leafing through newspapers, when they came to the Derby section. Gin-Soaked boy was the name of a horse, as are all the other phrases that I've underlined below. So please, guys, before you just go ahead and do a copy-paste, at least check the context and/or relevance. Sheesh!   I'm the darkness in the light I'm the leftness in the right I'm the rightness in the wrong I'm the shortness in the long I'm the goodness in the bad I'm the saneness in the mad I'm the sadness in the joy I'm the gin in the  gin-soaked boy    I'm the  ghost in the machine  I'm the  genius in the gene  I'm the  beauty in the beast  I'm the  sunset in the east  I'm the  ruby in the dust  I'm the trust in the mistrust I'm the  Trojan horse in Troy  I'm the gin in the gin-soaked boy   I'm the tiger's empty cage I'm the  mystery's final page  I'm the stranger's lonely glance I'm the  hero's only chance  I'm the undiscovered land I'm the  single grain of sand  I'm the  Christmas morning toy  I'm the gin in the gin-soaked boy   I'm the world you'll never see I'm the slave you'll never free I'm the truth you'll never know I'm the place you'll never go I'm the sound you'll never hear I'm the course you'll never steer I'm the will you'll not destroy I'm the gin in the gin-soaked boy   I'm the  half-truth in the lie  I'm the why not in the why I'm the  last roll of the die  I'm the old school in the tie I'm the  spirit in the sky  I'm the  catcher in the rye  I'm the twinkle in her eye I'm the Jeff Goldblum in "The Fly"   Who am I?

      One of the things me and N do real often is speculate on who'll be the next James Bond.   As much as we like like guy whatisname... err... mr. remington steele... aah yes Pierce Brosnan... he's old now... he's losing it. Time to get rid of him. But we can never find a suitable replacement.  I always suggest Matt Damon because I'm partial to the guy. But he doesn't cut it. He doesn't have the suave thing.  Basically, we keep throwing names out... and measure the guy for a couple of things. First of all, he should have the suave type of thing going. He should be an action kind of guy... not tiny and puny. Then of course, he's got to set well with all the Bond girls.  Of course, when you talk about Matt Damon, you have to talk about Ben Affleck. While, one could possibly get him to do the parts with the girls, he seemingly doesn't cut it either for action or the suave thing.  Hmm... who else have we talked about? Cuz we've talked about tons of guys to become Bond. Well... Val Kilmer. I believe, Val Kilmer can go do all three. I think he's the man for the job. Yeah... kind of like in The Saint.  The thing is... he's gotta be old. Not over the hill, but you know... suit the part. Like take The World is Not Enough for example. How ridiculous was Denise Richards looking in that? Denise Richards should keep playing Wild Things type of roles. Similarly, you want someone who looks the part.  It was rumored that Matthew Perry was under consideration... and the idea is simply ridiculous.  How about Russel Crowe or George Clooney? Clooney seems over the hill... and Russel Crowe... hmm... you can think about Russel Crowe. But James Bond with an australian accent?  Actually you know... if Tom Cruise wasn't involved in Mission Impossible... he could be it. But he's involved in another franchise.  So, it's settled. Val Kilmer it is. (I think I left Nicolas Cage out of the discussion... but it's too late now!). Now all we need to do is coerce the directors, produces and val kilmer.  Anybody like to foot a competing candidate for Bond?

      The entire weekend, I kept listening to my New Young Radicals tape. Now, would anyone be familiar with this band that came in 1999? They came out with just this one album, and then the band split because of ego differences or whatever. So yes, I totally loved this band, loved each song and each word. Also, it was a time when there was a lot of turmoil and change in my personal life, so I have deep deep associations with just about every song :-)  Hmm well whatever, who cares. Here are some lyrics, the song is Someday we'll know. Get hold of the tape/MP3 if you can. Otherwise borrow from me :-)   90 miles outside Chicago can't stop driving I don't know why So many questions, I need an answer, two years later you're still on my mind  Whatever happened to Amelia Earhart? Who holds the stars up in the sky? Is true love just once in a lifetime? Did the captain of the Titanic cry?  Someday we'll know if love can move a mountain Someday we'll know why the sky is blue Someday we'll know why I wasn't meant for you  Does anybody know the way to Atlantis? Or what the wind says when she cries? I'm speeding by the place that I met you for the 97th time...Tonight  Someday we'll know why Samson loved Delilah One day I'll go dancin' on the moon Someday you'll know that I was the one for you  I bought a ticket to the end of the rainbow I watched the stars crash in the sea If I could ask God just one question why aren't you here with me...tonight?

      My elder cuz sister gave birth to a baby boy!!! Can you imagine that? We bloody grew up together, she and I! We fought like mad, caught each other's hair by the fistfuls and yanked each other about, scratched, clawed, and beat the shit out of each other when we were small. Today, she's a mother, and no, I can't even be there to see her basking  in her  new motherhood. Well whatever, I'm going home soon. Shall spend a day with her and her sprog or something :-)  *************  This morning I got a mail from da boss that I am scheduled for yet another training on Wednesday & Thursday. So there, no work on those two days, and no blogging either. Darn. Please miss me guys.  *************  And yes, I just have to write about this. Each morning, from about 5.45 to 7.00, I go for walk at the Jahanpanah City Forest just across the main road from where I live. It's a beautiful place, and in the early mornings, you can spot a dozen peacocks etc come out for their morning feed. Apart from this, all that much of untamed vegetation somehow is very nice. And I like that place, it has a calming influence on me.  Ok, so my main grouse is that I meet the same people everyday. I actually am on smiling terms with some of them, the rest just pass by with a look of recognition/acknowledgement. But there are some walkers who will like STINK so bad early in the morning! I mean, HOW ON EARTH do they manage that? Like they've slept all night right? So how can a person give off so MUCH stench while sleeping? So the thing is, that nowadays, I know who these people are, and I actually just stop breathing when I see them coming. I'm sorry, I know I'm being petty here, but I can't take it, I'm sorry.  *************  Have you noticed how, at any point of your life, there will be at least 7-8 people who will call you and not identify themselves and just carry on talking? It's OK if they call on your mobile, but on your landline? They expect to be recognized by their voices/drawl/twang whatever.  And na-aah, I don't like it.  *************  Next weekend, I need to get busy with my tickets for home. I'm planning to avail the apex fare of Jet Airways or IA or something. I'm sick and tired of the Rajdhani Express, and although I find train journeys superbly romantic, I've done th UP/Bihar topography-watching 16 times already and don't think I need more.  Going to work now.

      Tsk tsk... this world is so selfish. It's all about money. Everybody wants money to do something for you. There's no mention of doing something out of the goodness of your heart!   Go to some store... and all they want is money from you! They wouldn't just give it to you. Can you believe that? ;-)  It's all about money. Nothing else. Like.. if I want something... they want money. If I want to get a haircut... money again. Tsk tsk. Humanity is doomed.  How about all that talk about doing things for each other? I'll do something for you, you do something for me? Nooo!   That just doesn't work. Imagine... this: "hey you give me food... and... I'll debug some code for you, kapeesh?" Works fine, right?  Yeah I mean... hey... you give what you've got. I'll give what I've got. You give me a haircut... I'll normalize some tables for you.  But the world is selfish. They want money. And you know the biggest scam of them all... the biggest scam on earth. It's these couple of companies... they keep asking you to give them money even when you have not bought anything from them. Yeah.... seriously... you didn't take one thing from them. But they still keep asking you for hundreds of dollars. And you don't have a choice but to give it to them. Oh, btw... these companies are namely Visa, Mastercard and American Express. ;-)  Yeah... you never took anything from any of these companies... you never bought anything from them. But they keep sending you those bills.   What is this world coming to? Tsk tsk.

      For the uninitiated, Dax is a very good friend of mine. For the uninformed, Dax wears a ponytail and looks permanently grunge. For the uninterested, Dax is so evolved that Agony Aunts call him up for trauma therapy! For the ignorant, Dax writes lyrics for a premier English band in Delhi. Sometimes I wonder what Dax is doing in a place like NIIT! Well whatever, me glad Dax da man is here.  So Dax and I were talking today. And Dax was like ..." Man I can't take this anymore... "  Which is something he says every two nanoseconds, so I just looked at him and cleared my ears for a vent session. So his problem is that some girl of NIIT (he's not telling me which) went out for a film with him, and toyed with his ponytail! At which Dax thought she was generally interested in him, and so took her home. For the unaware, Dax lives alone with a neurotic dog so the chick scene is well, cool with him, know what I mean?  So this girl and Dax get home and get cozy at Dax-Base (name of Dax's pad), and just when they get into the good bed, and do the bad thing, the lady announces that she does not want to go all the way. This leaves Dax enraged and Dax spouts something obscene (again, he's not telling me) and the lady leaves in a huff.  Story over, Dax stubs out his Charminar (yes, Dax is no mean smoker, he goes for filterless!!), looks at me, and asks -    "But for all my Reggae and Ragga, I'm essentially North Indian, and for all my mammary fixation, two hours is all the time I can spend in that area - I need to move ahead! Why is she acting like the vestal virgin of Rome? Why, Reshma why is everything so fuck-all around this place?"    So I just look at Dax and mumble something like - It's Ok, it's alright, everything's going to be fine.. And I pat him on the back. And we walk back to our dead cubicles.  End of story.

      Good Morning World and I love you ALL immensely!  It's my dad's birthday today. I called him up in the morning and poor thing was not even up and awake, so he was like -  Huh? Yeah thanks, happy birthday to you too!    I just laughed and laughed and reminded him that a birthday wish is just to be said thanks to, you needn't have to wish me back, plus my birthday's in October! Lol, poor thing was totally disoriented!   I have no clue how old he's turning - maybe 62 or something(?)... But I do know this, that he has been the most special man in my life, and I would have married him had it not been for my mother who had the good sense to do that 31 years ago.  Love you baba!!!  Another birthday - is of my relatively new and very good female friend KK's! Infact, a lot of you who read my blog will already be familiar/friends with her. So here's wishing one of the most spunky women I know a very happy birthday. And may God give her everything she wants. No, on second thoughts, let Him only give her the things that are good for her :-)  So well, yeah, shiny happy day overall. And now I need to get back to work.

      Yesterday, I was writing an email to my father... and I really didn't have anything to write about... so I told him about how I was thinking that drinking all these herbal supplements had something o do with my IBS and stomach problem. my Arizona Green Tea... of which I drink a LOT... has ginseng in it.   Then I told him about how I was planning to finally complete my unfinished Master's degree. And how I would major in Chaucer, and that how a really good friend of mine sent me a message a day or two ago about how she was thinking of taking up a paper in Sylvia Plath ..... and that we were going to belong to enemy camps. I mean, me with my lyrical Chaucer and she with her angst-ridden Plath. And I told him about how it was interesting that everybody studies all the same stuff but ends up carving out their own niches and pet genres.  So, I got an email back from Dear Dad and he said that he enjoyed reading my email.    *Rolls Eyes*  Obviously my father can enjoy weird little things :-)))  hahaha... I'm telling you... as parents get older... or... as their children grow apart... they can start enjoying all kinds of weird little things ;-)  But anyways... he also said that he got the father's day card I had sent him. And that he really liked it... and I had chosen a really nice one. Oh yeah... nice card. I bought it for his birthday two years ago. It was a Chicken Soup for the Soul card.  So you know... he was happy when he got that. Hmm... told you he'd be happy. That's why I sent it to him... cuz it'd make him happy. Just that I don't really care for any "Days"... but... hey... if I can do anything to make my parents happy... I guess I'll do it!  Hahahaah... You should have seen my facial expressions change... at first I had this really bright smiling face saying "I'LL DO IT"... then it was more calm and saying "I'll do it"... finally i had a cynical face and ended up typing "I guess I'll do it"   So anyways... ya know... :-)

      For anyone who is longing to have a totally odd, dreamlike experience, I recommend switching off the lights in your room and listening to Phil Collins's  One More Night . I did it last night, and a few lines are coming back to me right now...     I've been sitting here so long Wasting time, just staring at the phone And I was wondering should I call you Then I thought maybe you're not alone Please give me one more night, give me just one more night Oh one more night, cos I can't wait forever    And with those lines, I was totally like lump in my throat, teardrop in my eye type thing :-) I'm smiling about it now but back then it really touched a raw nerve somewhere. I felt really cut somewhere, in a way that I haven't felt in a long long time.  So anyway ...you know...go do it, Listen to the song.

      Last evening I had nothing to do, so I took out my Gladiator CD and watched the first fight sequence. The first time I saw it - in the theater - I thought that the good guys were the people in the forest... and these people - romans - were the bad guys... the aggressors. In a while you learn that the romans were rather the protagonists.  In the movie, Maximus says "strength and honor" as he leaves after giving orders to be ready for battle. Strength and honor - virtues. Fighting for honor... has a nice ring around it. Contrast it with being the bad guys... the aggressors.... and indeed they were. They were the bad guys - shown as the good guys here.  When I saw the movie Atilla on USA, the Huns were the good guys. Romans were the bad guys. When I saw a movie on Chengis Khan, the mongols were the good guys. When I saw a documentary on the Ottomans, the mongols were the bad barbaric guys.  If you focus out a bit... see everything as a whole... from a bird's eye perspective... you see that everybody is somebody else's bad guy. Everybody is somebody else's weirdo.  The way something seems to you is only because of perspective. Call it your looking glass. View through another glass, and reality seems different. This point is best illustrated by looking at the the figure '6.' Watch it from one side, it's a six.   Look at it from the opposite side, it's a nine. Which one is it? Well... it depends on your perspective. And this principle is applicable to everyday life. Whatever you do, see, hear is all a matter of having a particular perspective. The person on the other side, the people behind the berlin walls of the world see the same things from a different angle. It looks different to them. From wars to conflicts to alliances to politics to everyday arguments... everything you look at... everything you see... is actually the result of this filter you wear.  Sometimes people tell me of "unbiased news reporting" and I always tell them that there is no such thing. Right down to the word... everything is based on what side you are on. Is it "anti-abortion" or "pro-life?" Depends on your perspective. "Terrorist/Rebel" or "freedom-fighter?" Depends on the perspective.

      As I handed over breakfast to my father yesterday morning, he looked at me and said, "You're getting married at 29." I stared at him and then began railing. It was a rant of denial, my friends, and although I'm not too sure I remember, I might have sounded something like this -   "Twenty-nine? So soon? Are you sure? Who told you?  That's like, three years away. So soon? I haven't had enough relationships yet.  So soon? Who told you, Baba, who told you? I should really speed up my moves now. If my marriage is three years away, I need to have as many affairs as possible before that. So many men, so little time!"   So then my pater brings out this yellowed scroll that is my first horoscope, made at the time I was born, and showed me that the stars indeed had predicted a late marriage for me. The chances of me tying the knot (or noose, if you please) are very high when I am twenty nine. Only now, the late marriage does not look so *late* anymore.  Oh, and to think that of all the guys I know already, not ONE is marriage material ...yeah, that knowledge helps a lot. So it should basically be someone who is going to materialize out of nowhere in the next three years, fit the *husband* bill as I see it, and make me fall in love with him (because arranged marriage remains a no-no), like me back in equal measure, AND be ready for commitment and marriage.  Hah! Like Charles Dickens said, "Great Expectations!"  Anyways, I will be off tomorrow for the land of Robbie T (Rabindranath Tagore for the uninitiated) - Shantiniketan, where I shall listen to the songs of the bauls - the travelling bards, and watch the dark tribal girls sway to the rhythm of mohua, the local liquor made from fermented dates.   It's as much Hedonism that I can work up at short notice. If I am indeed to be married within the next three years, I'm making sure I live the high life before I fall to my grave.  Ok, I'm going now.

      My daily routine is totally messed up. I go to bed at 2.00 in the morning, I wake up at 10.00, I go online after that, mum serves breakfast, bathe at noon, have lunch at 3.00 in the afternoon, go to sleep, wake up at 5.00 pm, get ready, go out, come back, go online, I'm chatting and surfing till midnight...and it goes on.  My mother is trying to feed me all the home-cooked food of the past seven months into this one fortnight that I am with them. Result - I'm eating somethiing or the other, all the time. And as if it wasn't enough of the fish, prawn, chicken and rice, my Dad brings back chocolates and pastries for me from office! And then he'll play his game of keeping them quietly in the fridge, so that I can locate them when I go to drink water or something. This used to be a little hide-and-seek/treasure-hunt type game between him and me when I was like, TEN, and it just does NOT hold anymore.  And for all of you who're thinking of asking me to control my willpower, it's pointless. I'm absolutely no good at resisting temptation. I mean....you go to drink water, you see a shiny bar of chocolate...what are you supposed to do? Look away?

      Last evening my friends took me to Inox, Calcutta's first multiplex, inaugurated last year. It nests on the top of Forum, which, I was informed, is the best shopping mall in the city. We saw Gaayab, starring Tushar Kapoor and Antara Mali. Total waste of time and money. And we had chocolate mousse from an Italian confectionery called Biscotti.  What struck me was the confused tangle that my city has become - of literature, culture, and consumerism.... Tagore and Satyajit Ray now rub shoulders with Suneet Verma and Shahnaz Hussein herbal potions.   And this has been my standard tirade against Calcutta for some time now. She's become a mix, and she hasn't been able to handle it too well.   I come here looking for College Street, old haven of books, the famous Coffee House filled with cigarette smoke, the smell of Kabiraji cutlet, and conversations about Marxism and its future. I come here to see the Alipore zoo and Sundari, its famous white Royal Bengal Tiger, I come to see National Library with it's supposedly haunted halls where the ghost of Lord Cornwallis can still sometimes be seen.   But what do I find? Instead, I'm handed with pubs, malls, and discotheques, and Marwari children jiving to Chunari Chunari while popping pouches of Pan Parag into their mouths.   Of course, I don't hold anything against these people, they've managed to very successfully take over the reins of a city from us lazy non-business-minded Bengalis, and are managing well. But what irks me is the way the city has become a toxic brew of old and new, heritage and boorishness, and old world sophistication and a rootless nouveau riche.  I was saying all this to my friends and one of them said ..."Reshma Sanyal, you're getting RUSTY, woman."   Yes, yes indeed, maybe I am :-)

      My dear friend Ranjith Jayaram called me from San Diego yesterday. Yes, a forty-five minute call from San Diego to Calcutta. Which is amazing, considering that none of my Delhi friends have done that yet (OK well two have, but those were so brief that they don't count).   I'd already told my mother about Ranjith so many times - He's my shrink, he's my mother, he gives me such good advice, we can talk for hours - that I put him on speakerphone and made him talk to my mother.   This was where I went wrong.  Have you ever noticed that when your friends and your mothers get together, they almost inevitably get into this bonding thing and start off on their own you-bashing trip? I mean, give them three minutes, that's all.  Then the conversation sounds like -  Mum - So (insert name of friend), can't you ask Reshma to quit smoking? We've told her so many times, but she just doesn't seem to listen. Smartass friend - I know aunty, i ALWAYS tell her not to, I mean I don't smoke myself (now who the hell wants THAT irrelevant detail?). I'm telling her for ages that she should quit, but aunty, she...... (Both look at me and shake their heads, their eyes brimming with lost hope).  Yeah, so anyways, more about yesterday. My mum was like..."Ranjith, she is bored here, she does not want to stay with us." And Ranjith was like..."But she was very excited before she left Delhi, what could have gone wrong with her?" My wise mater then pipes up with "Maybe she's missing her boyfriends!" And while I start choking on their BONDING, Ranjith smartly says, "But that's why I called her up, so that she doesn't!"   And they they both break into peals of laughter. In front of me, like I'm not even there! I mean, what is the BIG DEAL here? I don't meet my friends' parents and do the bonding-followed-by-character-assassination bit, so why do THEY indulge in it? Can't my mother see that I am sitting right there, that I am part of the conversation too?  Hooo boy.    Anyways, after that, Ranjith burst another bomb on my head. He said that he's off to watch a Jerry Seinfeld stand-up show on August 14. Sheesh! Nnnooooooooooooooooo!!! NO CAN DO, NO CAN BE!! (reshma in complete denial). How come he is the one watching Jerry Seinfeld live, how can he be the one sharing the same room/auditorium with him, breathing the same air? Jerry Seinfeld is my private demi-god, no one else TOUCHES him!  And what will I be doing on 14th August? Oh, I'll probably be sitting at home and watching TV or will be hanging out with my dead friends. Better still, I'll be at work.  Who really cares?  Ok, I'm going now. If you want to find me, I'll be glowering in rage against the world in a corner of my room.

      The new maid in my house is almost 6 feet tall. And very dark, and very broad. The first time I saw her, she reminded me of Grace Jones. And my mum said that she is the new maid, and had come from the Sunderbans, and has been in two marriages, and has seven children. And I was like Hoo boy!   Then there was this one time, I was sitting on the couch and watching the world go by (which is what I'm basically doing all the time on my holidays) she was working and my parents were also moving around. And my parents looked like two small dolls/figurines compared to her.  ************* Am I coming home too often? Last time I came in December, which was like, last YEAR! And this is what - end of July, so we're basically talking about a gap of 7-8 months. But this time, most of my friends are like "Hey you're back! Already?"   Hmmm, have to plan out leaves in a way that I remain desirable to them.  ************* Now, something I've always wanted to talk about.   I have a friend from college, and he's been my friend for over eight years now, I met him in college, and he's gay. I am also very close to his family; and everytime I come to Calcutta, I make it a point to visit them, and get invited over to lavish lunches etc :-)  So far so good. The catch is that, his mother is fond of me in a very "i-want-you-to-marry-my-son" way, and she's pretty unambiguous about the fact. Conversation, gestures, giving me gifts/flowers, introducing me to relatives (this is where I totally freak out)..the works!   Now I don't know whether she ia aware that her son is gay. I mean, of course, with him, it's VERY hard not to notice, what with all his gesticulating and hand-waving. But, what if she doesn't have a clue? Am I supposed to muster up the courage and TELL her that, like "Aunty, I know your son for ages now and he's a raving homo so I cannot be your daughter-in-law, not in this life at least?"  Or, she knows it, yet thinks that being queer is just a phase that he's passing through. (*Yeah right, a phase that is going to last for the rest of his life!*)   The worst part is, whenever I go, I can feel the expectations/hopes in the air. It kind of suffocates me. Everything is replete with the promise of a future ("when you'll be in our house/when you'll take care of your friend I won't have to worry about him anymore") that is just about NEVER going to happen!   So we've worked out an arrangement now. Whenever I come to Calcutta, I meet him outside separately for lunch, and then drop in at their house, and he stays away, on pretext of work.   Complicated, but convenient. And saves us both a lot of embarassment.  *********** Just back from lunch and realized what a long and boring entry this has been. Is Calcutta numbing my brain into dull oblivion?

      After sharing dinner, breakfast, and gossip with an Armenian family and two Bangladeshi Muslims who were going back to their country post-AIIMS treatment at Delhi, I got off at the Howrah station at 1.30 in the afternoon. As the train inched sluggishly along the platform, I caught a glimpse of Dad, craning his neck to see me. I felt my heart crumple at the corners as I noticed that he looked tired, and just that much older.   I reached home after fighting through traffic jams and the usual Calcutta grime. It hasn't changed much, this place. The buildings of the British Raj remain grey and looming, imposing stalwarts, witnesses of a city's evolution. The people...well they're still crossing the roads suicidally and fighting their heads off over bus crowds. CIty of Joy, Armpit of Humanity. :-) Nice.   It's so nice how they've kept my room just as I left it. With my small bed (it looks like a cot now), my cassettes (I checked them out again, my Bon Jovi albums have caught fungus :-(), my music system (black BPL thing I bought after the class twelve boards), and my posters. George Michael in blue, Sylvester Stallone clutching his gun, wearing his Aviator glasses in Cobra, Michael Jackson in red finery with his pet chimpanzee. My parents have even retained the graffiti on my bedroom door. Was just going through them today, and here's a taste... just check out how corny I was as a teenager...  1) Hey you, sitting naked by the phone, getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me? (this was from my Pink Floyd phase). 2) Mother do you think they will drop the bomb (see above note) 3) Be reasonable - demand the impossible! 4) I always refuse to listen to my conscience. How can I take advice from a complete stranger? 5) Never mind the bollocks, here's the sex pistols.  Aaaarrgggghhh what was i THINKING !!! :-))But hey, we all grow up like that. I mean, when I'm going to be THIRTY, i'll probably be embarassed of this blog entry!  And I also looked behind the door of my room. YES YES YES, the pictures of the GQ men in tight briefs are there too!  I met my two of my friends last night. Both working now, we grew up together. They remain as lovely as ever, and I'm glad that time or distance hasn't really made a difference to the bond we share.   And it's raining now. like POURING, so excuse me while I go stand in the balcony. God, I'm happy to be home.  More postcards soon.

         Kya karegi tu ghar se nikalke, jaaegi tu kahaan, Kya dekhegi tu Taj Mahal ko, main na hoon jo wahaan, Kya nazar aur kya nazaare, kuchh nahin inmein baat, Nagri-nagri kya dhoondegi, main nahi jo tere saath.  Kabhi aana tu meri gully Tujhe palkon pe rakhoonga ji. Baat dil ki karoon Hindustani jo hoon, Jab jee chaahe to aaja na jee. Kabhi aana tu meri gully  Kya karegi tu Kashmir jaake, swarg tera yahaan Kya baithegi tu Ganga-kinaare, main na hoon jo wahaan. Kya ye jannat, kya ye teerath, kuchh nahin tere kaam Ho jaaenge dhaam saare, legi jab mera naa-ha-ha-ha-haam.  Mere dil ke mohalle mein aake dil lagaake to jaa Saari gullian tujhe hee pukaarein, aake to sun zaraa. Na chinar hai, na pahadh hai, na samunder yahaan, Phir bhi shahron ka shahar hai, main rahoon jo yahaan.  Baat dil ki kahoon aur dil se hee sunoo… Baat dil ki kahoon tere dil mein rahoon… Kabhi aana tu meri gully Tujhe palkon pe rakhoonga ji. Kabhi aana tu meri gully Tujhe dil mein basaa loonga ji.  Roz roz meri gully aana hai bura Aake bina baat kiye jaana hai bura!

       Numb has to be my favourite U2 song. It has always been that way. The song was written by Edge and (i think) it says a lot about&nbsp;his role&nbsp;in the band/the world/life. The main video for the song is a riot. It is just The Edge watching TV (actually it's just made to look like he's watching TV, it's really just some light being refracted onto his face) while people do lots of random and funny things to him in an effort to divert his dedicated gaze.     &nbsp;  You see (among other things)      Bono and Larry singing directly into each of his ears     Adam wraps a piece of rope around his head    U2 manager Paul McGuinness' burly hand caressing his cheek    The hands of two of the belly dancers from the ZooTV tour massaging his shoulders    Someone cutting the straps of his black tank top with scissors    The belly dancers rubbing their feet all over his face as if he is a foot fetishist    A little girl beating her hands on his face    Two beautiful women kissing and licking both sides of his face simultaneously,     A short succession of fans taking snapshots of themselves with him.    Directed by Kevin Godly, this video&nbsp;illustrates why The Edge - always quiet and reserved - has become battered and numb in a short, abstract history of U2.   Here are the lyrics - in a strange way, they've always been very dear to me.    *sigh*    &nbsp;  Don't move    Don't talk out-a time    Don't think    Don't worry, everything's just fine    Just fine.     &nbsp;  Don't grab    Don't clutch    Don't hope for too much    Don't breathe    Don't achieve    Don't grieve without leave.     &nbsp;  Don't check, just balance on the fence    Don't answer    Don't ask    Don't try and make sense.     &nbsp;  Don't whisper    Don't talk    Don't run if you can walk,    Don't cheat, compete    Don't miss the one beat.     &nbsp;  Don't travel by train    Don't eat    Don't spill    Don't piss in the drain    Don't make a will.     &nbsp;  Don't fill out any forms    Don't compensate    Don't cover    Don't crawl    Don't come around late     &nbsp;  Don't hover at the gate    Don't take it on board    Don't fall on your sword    Just play another chord     &nbsp;  Don't change your brand    Don't listen to the band    Don't gape    Don't ape    Don't change your shape    Have another grape     &nbsp;  Don't plead    Don't bridle    Don't shackle    Don't grind    Don't curve     &nbsp;  Don't get    Don't swerve    Don't lie, die, serve    Don't theorise, realise, polarise    Chance, dance, dismiss, apologise     &nbsp;  Don't spy    Don't lie    Don't try    Imply    Detain    Explain    Start again     &nbsp;  Don't triumph    Don't coax    Don't cling    Don't hoax    Don't freak    Peak    Don't leak    Don't speak     &nbsp;  Don't project    Don't connect    Protect    Don't expect    Suggest.     &nbsp;  Don't struggle    Don't jerk    Don't collar    Don't work    Don't wish    Don't fish    Don't teach    Don't reach     &nbsp;  Don't borrow    Don't break    Don't fence    Don't steal    Don't pass    Don't press     &nbsp;  Don't try    Don't feel    Don't touch    Don't dive     &nbsp;  Don't suffer    Don't rhyme    Don't fantasise    Don't rise    Don't lie.

      I've been closely following the the diary of a girl on OD. She doesn't write a lot, but the diary has been going on for a couple of years now. So, it has a decent amount of entries. I like it. Even I want to write like that. It has a different flair to it. She talks writes about her thoughts, about what she thought of the Paper Clip in Word helping you more than you wanted to be helped :-)   But the difference is that it's not your typical angry or sad or complaining entry. They are thoughtful entries. Hmm... I don't have writing like that. Mine are just random incohorent babble.... if that is a word.   She talked about how she first went to a psychoanlayst. I probably need to do too. Seriously. Seems like I don't know the difference between fiction and reality. I hate the feeling of being sad. I would avoid it at all cost.   I don't even like to see people getting sad on TV or in the movies. I change the channel whenever something sad is about to happen for any of the characters on TV. I'll close my eyes, I'll walk out of the room, I'll change the channel, I'll stop the video, I'll forward the parts, I'll do whatever to get past the parts where some character gets sad.  &nbsp;  See... that's why I probably need a psychoanalyst.   Oh since I'm talking about psycho stuff, let me tell you another thing. Though this really happened, it's not one of my delusions. But my parents always said that I was making it up. Though, I even have my cousin sister to corroborate (sp?) the story. She'll swear that it happened. But nobody would believe her either. They'll think we were both cuckoos sharing a delusion.   It happened when we were very small. I was probably 5. And my cousin was probably 3. We were on the roof of our apartment building. And I swear this plane flew right over our heads. Very very very close! We even wanted to catch and restrain the plane with a rope! ;-) But it was a little too fast for a 5 and a 3 year old :-p Years later, my father wouldn't agree that a plane could go right over our heads... meaning just over a building.   We're not making it up! It happened... really. It was on top of our head. Think about it... on the outskirts of the city. And it was a building. I don't know how many floors it had, probably 5-6. And it was the roof. Surely a plane could be close. But anyway.   Hmm... any more psycho stuff? let me think. Well I don't think there is... beyond the run of the mill stuff like depression, anxiety, esteem, etc. :-)

      I know that APPREHENSIVE is the last thing I should be feeling before I make my bi-annual trip to Calcutta, but there is a reason why I'm feeling this way. It's because most of the people I meet - relatives and extended family - will ask me - point-blank - about marriage. Yes, the dreaded M-word.   The ones who won't will make obtuse interrogations about my age. And worse, they'll couch it in concern and care.   "  So Reshma, how long has it been that you left Calcutta? You completed your graduation before you left for Delhi, right? Seems like ages...quite the Delhi-ite you've become - working woman, independent and all haan?  "   "  Have you managed to get yourself a Punjabi boyfriend? No? How come? We thought you would have hooked   ( hooked? like an anchor? Or better still, a fish? I  hate  that word )   a proper Punju man by now  ."   "  There is this Astro- Physics research scholar in Oxford that I told your parents about. Quite the guy for you. He's in town nowdays. Why don't you two meet over dinner and exchange notes?  "   "  Still living alone? And that too in the crime Capital? Tsk tsk....No one to look after you. We're worried about you aaalll the time! Tell me, aren't you considering marriage?  "   Most of the times I just want to tell them that I will NEVER settle for less than I deserve! Or ask them why it is that they have nothing better to do than to ask stupid, rude questions! Usually the first works for me. I've gotten close to saying the second, but by then they've backed off.   I really wish people would mind their own business. I can't stand exceedingly interfering relatives who make it their singlehanded mission in life to inquire about your marital status and to jabber on incessantly about the "right age". Please!   Half the people who ask these questions are in dismal marriages anyway. They're content to live a life of incommunicado with their husbands - they just shop, eat, gossip and INTERFERE. Some life, that!   And here is my take on the entire picture of arranged marriage:  Do you not die alone?  Are the people arranging your marriage looking out for your best interests?  Noooooo, they're not.  They want to get you married so they can have one less thing to worry about.  Sorry, that sounds blunt, but that is the truth of the matter in most cases.   They will tell you that you should get married by a certain age, then you should have kids by a certain age, and what is their justification?   Tradition .   Does common sense enter the picture?   Nope .

        Lonliness dominates you. You can hide it well, but its there, and your friends can see it. You constantly feel alone, and need to do things to fill your time. Your afraid to tell people this, but sooner or later it gets out in a bad way, and you think you screwed up everything. And when you are in love is when you are sad the most.

      I like talking to old people. They just know so much, it's interesting talking with them. You know, coupla years ago, I was at my grandmother's home. And my mother asked me to sit and talk with her with OLD uncle.  &nbsp;  And I was like 'Mein Gott. What am I supposed to say to him?'   To my shock and surprise, he could talk about just about any topic. I spent a lot of time sitting and talking with him. I was totally baffled actually. I was probably smiling all the time because I had expected him and he was probably some 80-90 years old to... just say nothing... and be kind of in a reclusive state mentally not really bothering with the world.   The thing I always like talking with them is about how they gauge the world - now versus some 60 years ago. Once I had an old lady tell me how a river flowed just near to where we were 50 years ago. And I was like... geez... THAT old river over THERE, it used to be HERE?  Fascinating... Change is fascinating. And even more so when you hear a first-hand account of it.  ---------------------  The last few weeks have flown by in SUCH a tizzy that I really need time to stop and breathe now. So yes, I am socializing too much. I've been coming home at two and three every morning, attending dinners and parties and blog meets and meeting old friends from Hyderabad and Mumbai and what-not. I should maybe post some pictures of all the gatherings here.  &nbsp;  Let me know if you need to see them.  --------------------  My mum called last night to say that our building had been struck by lightning and that the fans, TV, AC, fridge had all stopped working. Also, the balcony of the floor above ours had cracked up and the walls had come apart. She was sounding so shell-shocked. I felt bad for her. Whoever thinks this kind of thing can happen anymore? Bad bad Calcutta!&nbsp;  -------------------  Why are these lyrics stuck in my mind all the time? I've been hooked onto this song for&nbsp;over the past one month now - it's my worst display of Obsessive Compulsive Behaviour&nbsp;so far. Just posting them here, hoping to get it out.  &nbsp;   Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken    Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you’re wrong    Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation    The best soy latte that you ever had . . . and me     &nbsp;   Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet    Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day    And head back toward the milky way    Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star    One without a permanent scar    And did you miss me while you were looking at yourself out there...

      Hugh&nbsp;Jackman remains an elusive dream. Today I was checking out his bio and saw that his birthday is on October 12th. !!!!!!! And my birthday is on October 15. I mean... see the connection guys? It's in the stars!  &nbsp;  Last night I watched Van Helsing again. In the theatre, for the 11.45 pm show, with two friends who kept badgering me with questions like -  &nbsp;  1) "But this is a  HORROR  film, right?!?!?! Where's the horror???"  &nbsp;  2) "They spent 200 million bucks on making  THIS  movie?"  &nbsp;  3) "So are these two (Jackman and the heroine) going to  KISS  sometime soon or  NOT ?"  &nbsp;  4) "Jackman is going to be the next Bond guy. Think he'll do well?"  &nbsp;  *sigh*  &nbsp;  Am off to work now. It's a Saturday and I have come into work after reaching home at 3.00 am this morning. That really says an awful lot about my life.

      Hmm... there's so much that I have to say, but there's just no clear way to say it. To put it quite concisely, I am disturbed by what I see in the world. I really want everything to go away. Call me a naive fool, but I'd really be much more happy if I saw the world co-existing peacefully.  Because... you have to understand... it bothers me. See... I'm even writing an entry about it when I really ought to be working.  I was chatting with someone couple of days ago, and I said that I despised the world. Because I do, right? I said that I didn't really hope about anything... and that kind of makes me a real pessimist, and that's kind of funny because I usually consider myself as an optimist. But I don't really expect anything out of the world. I told her that everything was just me vs. them. And who is them? Everybody.  But you know... everso often it happens that I read blogs and stuff, and I find that there are people out there who aren't totally loony. Some of are really intelligent and rational people... who aren't blinded by ideologies and "us versus them" mentality. They actually talk sense.  So for a moment I start to think that maybe there actually ARE people out there who make sense. For the most part, I'm always convinced that the world is out there to kill me. She said that I was "disturbed"... hehe. But then sometimes I read people and I see that hey, not everybody is bad like I think.  However, that is also a short lived feeling - which lasts about till the next time I check a newspaper or read some lunatic comments on mesageboards. Then I go back into "see! I told you the world is full of crazy yahoos" state.  It's all this hate which keeps driving me up the wall. I told her that I got judaism as my top ranked religion. She asked me if I'd go to Israel then. I told her I wanted to go to jerusalem. But if I'd go there, I was pretty sure both Israelis and Palestianians would cohort together and kill me. Then they'd go back to killing each other. She said 'see... there's no escape. there'll always be somebody out there who hates you no matter where you are.' That's why I wanted a jungle!  Lunatic people, societies, countries, whole goddamn world - fighting and killing everyone over land, water, oil, language, state, religion.... PRIDE! nuts, totally nuts! The whole lot of them... crazy, insane lunatics!  On top of it all, this nut keeps sending me me emails with viruses in them. I mean... this is getting too much you know?  I mean... all I want is some peace of mind! At least cut it out with the viruses if not other things!!!!  And I'm sick of people fighting over religion. They should go and abolish religion!  And I don't like people taking extreme positions. That includes people who have conspiracy theory as a hobby and keep blaming everything on the government AND people who adopt a our-government-is-an-embodiment-of-holiness policy. Get real! Damn people keep taking a hardline approach on either sides. both of them are nuts.  Bah... i hate the world.

      Done with Salman Rushdie's  Shame . Yeah, I never follow my own reading lists :-) I'll bump into something outside of my list and go on with that. Actually I have  A house for Mr. Biswas  lying around which I haven't given much attention to.  So... Shame. Well... it was pretty decent in the first half. Even three quarters maybe. But towards the end it went all weird. Just like  Fury  if I might say so.  Shame  is a pseudo-history of Pakistani politics. It is common for authors to use historical events as basis for their novels. But typically Rushdie goes much further. He intermeshes history with fiction and then unless one is very familiar with facts, you wouldn't know if he's making that bit up or if he's recounting facts as they were or as they were reported or what. In short most people can't really make sense.    Satanic Verses  is also the same deal.   So... the story takes place in Pakistan but not there.  In Q. which is not Quetta, near A.  Which is not Afghanistan, with a president A.  Who is not Ayub, 'old town' which is not Karachi, 'new town' which is not Islamabad, and so and so forth.   So everybody knows what he means inspite of him saying otherwise in the novel (people usually abandon this logic if they're reading  Satanic Verses  - then they vehemently suport that if he says he's talking about somebody else then you should take him on his word). But anyways... maybe you CAN distinguish between Pakistan and Peccavistan but for me it was certainly blurry.   Anyways... Rushdie has some gems of humor in the novel:   "'Angrez double-dutch,' said Chhunni-ma, and the three mothers shrugged as one. 'Who is to understand the brains of those crazy types?' asked Munnee-in-the-middle, in tones of final dismissal. 'They read books from left to right.'"   :-)  The novel is about Shame:    "'You need not be too happy,' she adds, 'because when you leave this house you will be wounded by many sharp names, which pople will throw at you, like knives, in the street.'.... 'Come home without hitting anyone' she instructs, 'or we will know that they have lowered your pride and made you feel the forbidden emotion of shame.'"   And there are some portions in and around the above dialogue, about shame, which are really good. That's why I love reading Rushdie... the guy has this certain flair and also is intimately familiar (for good reason) with Indo-Pak cultural aspects.  There was some biting wit as well:    "By the time the sun rose it was clear that the government was going to fall. That morning the pople took to the streets and set fire to motor cars, school buses, Army trucks and the libraries of the British council and United States Information Service to express their displeasure."   And as I've said before, you can't fully get a Salman Rushdie novel because he interpreses his writings with non-English words without translations in footnotes, etc (They should really put in footnotes with meanings - but then maybe that ruins the effect... I dunno). In this book, he talks about three Generals  Raddi ,  Bekar  and  Phisaddi : 'Trash/Waste', 'Useless', and 'Error-prone/Idiot'.  Anyways... so three-fourth of it was okay. Then he went into morphed a girl into some sort of killer zombie who began roaming the country killing people at lightning speed and superhuman strength. Ummm... weird stuff.    Three and a half out of Five.

      This morning I was thumbing through the calendar about something, and realized that it's been more than a year now since I saw S.   I met him last at Golden Dragon, Vasant Vihar, where I told him I could not accept circumstances as they were and that we had rather go our own ways. And no, we had rather not remain friends, since it would just hurt me too much to be sitting across each other and take stock of all the could-have-beens.  The split, of course, had happened much longer ago, and the last few months were like prolonged death rituals - meet a few times, see (pointlessly, hopelessly) if anything could still be worked out. More often than not, the conversations would end in tears, recriminations, and lots of regret.  Funny, now that I think of it. Time was when we met almost daily, spoke on the telephone for hours. And now, we're in the same city, live four kilometres away from each other, but I haven't even seen him for the past whole year.   Yes, I build my walls well.   One day... someday.. I hope I will be open to meeting him. For maybe a friendly chat, catching up on what has transpired, taking notes on each others' careers and whereabouts. It might take me  another ten years to get there, but neevrtheless, I hope I shall be able to do it.   I've forgiven more people for more grievous mistakes, so why not this?   P.S.= Although I'm not open to lowering my defences, I do wish him well and hope he gets incredible personal happiness.

      Prince Charles was in Iraq boosting soldier morale. But why was he in camouflage? What prompts these guys to don military clothing!!??? Is it that they think soldiers will identify with them more or will treat what they say with more worth if they're in military uniform?  Or is it some sort of psychological need - the need to feel macho or something? Is it a lack of confidence?   Now while Bush and Charles both have done this, I feel they fall in different categories. Bush's military costume was a stupid marketing stunt. Charles doesn't have a need for that stupid marketing stunt. Nobody's voting him out.   I mean... yes, he has to justify all the money that's spent on the royal family but still that's not in the same league.   Now why do I have a problem with it?  It's not so that think they aren't worthy of the uniform or that it means something special to wear it. I just think it's kind of stupid. And that they're trying to take some of the shine and lustre of the uniform. I see it as taking credit for being a soldier... which they are most definitely not. That's Bush. But Charles is just beyond reason! One can't comprehend why he'd wear military gear!!!  I know!!! I know!!!!!!!!  It's because of that scandal with the butler! Charles now needs to prove his manhood! And what better way than to cover yourself with the shroud of testosterone! If there is anything which is male, it's fighting!

      What rot :-p It put my IQ at 116 (average is put at 100).   Actually, whenever I take IQ tests, I always find myself criticizing them. They have a section in it for knowing meaning of words. Now, I did know what Loquacoius and Garrulous meant. But that shouldn't mean that I'm intelligent. I knew them because they are GRE/GMAT words. Then everybody might encounter some set of words in their course of work.   That shouldn't make a difference.  Then they showed a picture of a grocery store stand for a couple of seconds and asked where the zuchhini (sp?) was located. And I was like... but... but... I don't know what zuchchini (sp?) looks like!  Then there were stacks of idioms, the meaning of which you had to know. There were some idioms/sayings I hadn't seen but that was not a problem. Howevever, I still don't think that knowing them counts as "intelligence."  Overall, I'm not a fan of IQ tests. I'm not sure what they should ask but I know what doesn't belong in there. Maybe all the mathematical and/or quantitative questions are okay. But that might be a  biased view because I'm a whiz at doing numbers. All the questions were timed and I was done with the number questions in a couple of seconds that's... like 15-20 seconds in advance of the finishing time.   Or maybe they should only include the shape questions where you are required to figure out patterns and such.   There was a time when I avoided doing any kind of intelligence tests. I reasoned that I didn't want to cause a dent in my confidence/pride/self-worth in case of a lower than expected result. But I think once I knew what kind of questions they ask, I took them on. That only goes to show that practice can also defeat these tests. It's not supposed to happen though.   IQ scores... even GRE and GMAT scores are supposed to be a constant measure of yourself. They're not supposed to change regardless of what you do. Try telling that to a GRE/GMAT student :-)

      An interesting battle is developing. Can yoga guru Bikram Choudhury patent his  asanas ? A dozen European towns are fighting to protect the names of their most famous exports. Can Australia manufacture champage? Can Asiago cheese be made in the US? Is American Basmati an oxymoron?   The argument goes that the original makers of these products are European towns. Anything made outside of the area does not have the same quality and is misleading on its origin. Real champagne is made in Champagne.   One explanation I read in a book about wines, about their nomenclature, was that the European names were only meant to guide consumers (who largely happened to be Europeans) as to the content of the bottle. Europeans were familiar with their own names and thus, familiar names let them understand the type of the product.   Yet another explanation of European nomenclature questioned the confidence of non-European producers. It said the European names were more a result of an inferiority complex – borne out of an understanding that the copy was really a copy and would never be the original.  However, a counter argument is that wine manufacturers in other places came from the very same European towns in the first place. So they started use of the very same methods and quality and thus the European names are used rightly.  The question of Basmati is similar but a little different. Basmati is not the name of a town. It’s a variety of rice that has evolved in India and is certainly Indian. Introduce American corporations who come in and try to patent common Indian ingredients from rice to spices. They claimed to have “discovered” the medicinal properties in the  Neem  tree. No shit! You don’t need fancy labs to find that out… you need to ask any 10-year old in India. Ditto for spices.  Coming back to rice though, American courts ruled that US corporations could use the term Basmati… and not only that… they could use "better than Basmati." Thus you got "Textmati: American Basmati" rice.   I think we can organize the issue in a number of questions: 1) Do the foreign producers of that product seek to capitalize on the product’s name? 2) What does the name of such products suggest: their source or their type/content?  In some ways, you could liken it to the trademark business. Originally a word may suggest both source and content.   But after a while, the word becomes a standardized description of the product. Champagne, for instance. So you could say that the use of the name is only to indicate the type of product.  However, there is also a move away from the European names. For example, "champagnes" are increasingly referred to as just "sparkling wines.” Sparkling denotes the content. But I believe that’s because the name Champagne is already protected. Nevertheless, they *are* moving away towards generic naming.  Next: Is the production of those products – even under another name – a hijack? Should they be treated as a sort of patented product that others can’t produce? I would tend to argue against that. I think after a long while the demand for the product demands that it be produced everywhere.   But I’m not in favor that these big corporations then go and patent something that they didn’t create and prevent the original producers from producing it (or having them license the “new” product) – as in the case of the biotech firms and well-known Indian spices, etc. That’s ludicrous. Not just that… it’s plain unethical.   The naming…. Hmm… well I think we also need to consider who gets the naming rights within those towns. Does everybody get it by the virtue of being within the boundaries of the town? Will somebody outside the legal boundary – say a mile outside - get to use the name?  Maybe the outside towns could be asked to use "*-style" in their naming. "Champagne-style wine." Kind of like what happened to Microsoft and it’s PalmPC. It was forced to use "Palm-sized PC" because Palm said "PalmPC" was too close to "PalmPilot."

      And I'd also like to say... Foul! My father's going to Italy. That's foul play.   I'm the one who should be going to Italy. I am the one who wants to go hunt for Roman relics. I've been trying to do that for ages. Last time (and only time) i went to Europe, they said I couldn't choose Rome as "stopover" on my way to UK and it would instead be akin to going to Rome. And then boarding another flight onward from Rome. That translated to two thousand more dollars or some such astronomical figure.. I didn't have two thousand dollars back then. I don't have it even now.   But mark my words... one day, I'll go there. Of course, I have another European trip planned in my head for 2008. You know... watching the total solar eclipse from the Turkish Bosphorus? :-)   Too bad my boyfriend-to-be is taking his time showing up. By 2008, I'll already have money for it in the bank. We could be off anytime we want. Got the plan, got the money... but he's not here.

      I'm still thinking why I picked up this one. I don't know quite what prompted me to. It was generally expected stuff. Usually these kinds of books have two flows: one is more manner-oriented. What should you do and what you shouldn't do in situations. How to distinguish between 10 different forks? What to do with olive pips? etc. etc. The second part is how to put on an air of sophistication... without being sophisticated. This second type usually has books on specific subjects as well. For example, you can find books on how to talk about books and films without having read/seen them.   And so does this book also incorporate both of these varieties in it.  In one segment, it'll say that you have to be yourself. In the next, it's telling you what you should not be drinking. Strictly no Screwdrivers (Vodka and orange juice. An uninspired choice for the uninspired man.) or Long Island Teas (because it's unoriginal).   It lists what the Rennaissance was... and how its art works differ from Baroque ones. It lists what books and films you should have seen. Now that's a bit more acceptable... no harm in listing major works that deserve a look. But in the end, they're all about making you someone you're not and making you sound sophisticated.   They'll be a section on hygiene, on grooming, on sex (don't be concerned with the size of your penis), etc. etc. Blah, blah blah. And a customary ending negating everything they've said in the book along the lines of "be yourself". And the final word: don't be an asshole.   That's metro!

      What can you do? It's just this one world. You just have to live here. You don't really have much of a choice. It's either life or death. And people usually choose life. We could actually blame this on God. I mean... just this one world. And then too not even a choice of where you are born in this world. Maybe if we had choices, it would be of some consolation. But there isn't. You can't control where or to whom you are born. And your fortune really depends on where you are born. It's practically your life script.  You could be born in affluency or you could be born in poverty. Don't think less of those who live in abject poverty because it could have very well been you! Because it's really not in your control. It's an uneven playing field. What you are is to an extent determined by what chances you got.  Say you were born in Timbuktu or Sierra Leone or Somalia. What kind of a future can you expect? Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Is it the fault of any of those people over there? Of course not. Life just happens to you. Or maybe you could be born in Scandinavian countries! Suddently you have a life of social comfort available to you.   You're nearly set for life. Or you could be born to parents in Central Europe and have a life of affluence or culture waiting for you. Or maybe China or India teeming with more than 2.5 billion people.... with a glorious past, but uncertain future. Or maybe you might be born to parents in an upscale neighborhood in America and have a life of extravagance waiting for you.   It's really not up to you. Sure you can say that the child born in Addis Ababa might receive more love than the one born in Oxford. Sure you can say that your life is what you make of it. And that could be really true if everyone had the same chances available to them. But it isn't way.   I read an article a little while ago criticizing minorities who claim that they are discriminated against. The author gave a bunch of high profile names who happened to be minorities and asked how they happened to be where they were if it was true that some people got preference over others.  Yeah. Sure. I could even show you that Kofi Annan was born in Ghana and then went on to do his second term as the UN Secretary General. But that doesn't mean anything. There isn't that kind of opportunity floating around for every child born in Ghana.  Why be concerned? Why let it be an issue? Why talk about it? Why would the playing field even need to be the same? You just have what you have.  Hehe... somebody try posing those questions to Oracle, Sun, and Netscape. They're the ones always screaming about bringing Microsoft down to make it a even playing field.  So, why does it have to be accepted in business but not in life? Not to say that I'm asking the wealth of the wealthy be stripped and given to poor children of Peru. I'm just saying that one has to recognize that the way you are and live and the opportunities that you have are NOT just a reflection of what you are made of. And there's not really a nice hunky dory government who cares about its citizens giving them all the opportunities of life and pursuit of happiness and prosperity. It lies inherently in the thing that no one in the world can control - your origin.  Then of course you see people thanking their stars for being born where they were born. And that bugs me too? But then you might ask... hey Reshma, isn't that exactly what you were saying - that the chances you get are more or less pre-determined, so wouldn't it be right to thank your stars (or God or whoever or whatever)? Yeah, you know... it makes some sense but I don't really like much to react to something which you didn't have any role in.   Whatever... i'm going.

          Why don't they make 'em like you anymore?   When I look into your eyes I can see a love restrained But darlin' when I hold you Don't you know I feel the same 'Cause nothin' lasts forever And we both know hearts can change And it's hard to hold a candle In the cold November rain  We've been through this such a long long time Just tryin' to kill the pain But lovers always come and lovers always go And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today Walking away If we could take the time to lay it on the line I could rest my head Just knowin' that you were mine All mine  So if you want to love me then darlin' don't refrain Or I'll just end up walkin' In the cold November rain Do you need some time...on your own Do you need some time...all alone Everybody needs some time...on their own Don't you know you need some time...all alone  I know it's hard to keep an open heart When even friends seem out to harm you But if you could heal a broken heart Wouldn't time be out to charm you  Sometimes I need some time...on my own Sometimes I need some time...all alone Everybody needs some time...on their own Don't you know you need some time...all alone  And when your fears subside And shadows still remain I know that you can love me When there's no one left to blame So never mind the darkness We still can find a way 'Cause nothin' lasts forever Even cold November rain

      Dear CEO of The Coca Cola Company,  I tried your new Vanilla Coke. It had like umm.... the flavor of vanilla in it.  Sincerely,  - [rS] -    ---------------------- Have I ever mentioned one thing I like about Spiderman?   It kind of slipped my mind when I did my spiderman entry. If you haven't seen it, you might not want to read this paragaph. So like spidey says, all stories really are about girls. And so was Spiderman. And in the end, 'ol spidey does manage to get the girl. Except that he doesn't. He decides that a love would just compromise his spidey-self and he had a much larger responsibility to the people.   Also kind of reminded me of a number of Moses movies I've seen where the Pharoah tells his son to prepare himself for being Pharaoah. Often than not, that dialogue usually has the words "harden yourself" in it. That's exactly what spidey was doing. If you've seen any movies, you know the bad guys always look for your weaknesses. And the object of your affection qualifies real well.   I just kind of liked that ending, nothing really to do with "love stinks" actually.  --------------------------------------- What would you say is the most famous wall in the world? A couple of days ago, CNN mentioned the "most famous wall" in the world?  Now wouldn't you say the most famous wall in the world is the Great Wall of China? No? I think so. That's the most famous wall in the world. But CNN didn't agree with me. They said that the Berlin Wall was the most famous wall in the world. Pshhh... it's not even a wall anymore ;-) Hehe... but seriously, Berlin Wall is okay... but surely you concede that the Great Wall of China is much more famous.  There's a third competitor... but a distant one. The Wailing Wall. And while there's much religious importance, I wouldn't really say that it's anyone near as famous as The Great Wall of China or even the Berlin Wall.  So what do you think of when you think of the most famous wall in the world?    ------------ okay... i'm manipulative. i plead guilty. what can i say?   i store any good news i have. And then later when I do something bad or have bad news to give, then I retrieve the good news from the store and wrap it around the bad news. I create an artificial cushion.  Like once when I spend too much money and had to let my parents know. I multiplied the number 2-3 times and said that that is what I spent. When they looked at me in disbelief, I said that he was just kidding and it was only half or one-third of whatever he said (the original amount). So while nothing really changed, I also created an artificial cushion... "not as bad as it could have been." -------------------  My computer hard drive is littered with incomplete "draft" entries for my blog... some which I never wrote in complete, some I chose not to put online. But they're all ideas that I want expanded.   Writing a blog serves two purposes I think. I try to write about what I think of various issues or situations, I just like to put out my opinions to garner any reaction I can get. Then, the other half just serves as a diary where I just write about my day. That part is basically for myself... for record. Sometimes I go and read my old entries. That's why they're there.  I've noticed that people selectively read only one kind of entries on my diary. Some come searching for serious entries and find that there are a lot more entries that don't mean much. Some come for the non-serious ones and ask "dude, when did you go serious on us?" when they find the serious ones. Ahh well. I just write what I feel like. If people like to read it, good.  I like writing. As a youngster, I had short stories published in youngster magazines, youngster magazine issues of local news papers, etc. I do believe I once took a creative writing class. Hehe... I don't even remember now. Writing a novel is kind of a dream actually. Let's see if it goes anywhere.

      In what I see as a mark of ultimate cooldom, I went and saw two films on Saturday.   All by myself.   No, I don't need any props to go watch films now. So I saw  Van Helsing  and  Troy , one after another. And here's how it happened. Van Helsing began at 12.00 noon, so I went in, bought the coke and popcorn, watched the film, came out at 2.15, called my friend in Hyderabad (?), went back in at 2.45 p.m. and saw Troy, this time with chicken hotdog and Pepsi! Totally amazing experience. No opinionated friends, no scrunging in the same bag for popcorn, and no eager boyfriend's arm curling around your shoulder. So yes, this trend is something I will do more often - watch films with myself.  About the films now:  Van Helsing is like a Greatest Hits collection of monsters - Count Dracula, his fanged brides, Frankenstein's Monster, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, werewolves, Igor the scientist's deformed helper, and so on. The movie is of course directed by Stephen Sommers (The Mummy, The Mummy Returns), so I did go in expecting a special FX overkill, but Sommers has really unleashed his imagination here, and CGI only adds to his cause.      Hugh Jackman (Wolverine in X-Men) as Van Helsing is very much in control of the film and Kate Beckinsale is Anna Valerious, his comrade in adventure. Richard Roxbright is amazing as Count Dracula, and a very handsome Will Kemp is Valken Valerious, who turns into a werewolf about 5 times in the film.   As I was coming out, I remembered a poem that I read as a kid -    The zombies were having fun  The party had just begun  The guests included Wolf Man  Dracula and his son.   Go see Van Helsing if you like monsters and spectacle.   And now, ladies and gentlemen - Troy. The sentiment of the film can be summed up in Hector's words -  " I live my life by a code, and the code is simple. Honour your gods, love your women, and fight for your country."      I just have to say this -  Brad Pitt is a good actor and a handsome man, and apparently he worked out for six months to get muscle for the role, but Achilles is not a character he inhabits comfortably. On the other hand, Eric Bana (Black hawk Down, The Hulk) slips far more easily into the role of Hector, true son of Troy, who goes down fighting bravely for a cause not even his own.   What the movie doesn't explain is why Helen would leave with Paris after having slept with him for a few nights. Is it because her loins throb with passion for a hero? No, because she tells him: "I don't want a hero. I want a man I can grow old with."   Not in Greek myth, you don't :-)  I've finally got my own website so the next few days will see me going berserk with that. Work's piling up so I need to get going now. Bye people!

      Most people I meet, when asked what their favourite love song is, chances are 95 out of 100 that they'll name all or any of the following love songs of the pop-music canon:  1)  Can't help falling in love with you  - UB40 (Originally a droopy Elvis creation, until UB40 raped it with reggae.)   2)  Everything I do  - Bryan Adams (This one has been anthologized into monotony.)  3)  Unchained Melody  - Righteous Brothers (Nice, but over-sold. Plus, guys like it because of the Demi Moore/potter's wheel/Ghost connection.)  4)  It must have been love  - Roxette (No, no, no! You guys don't get it. Love songs don't have to conform to the man-meets-woman-and-fall-apart-and-get-back formula. Pretty Woman was a film. No happen in real life! Please!)  5)  I'd love you to want me  - Lobo (no one had heard of this song or even Lobo until Indica cars used it for their ad with a very toothy Fleur Xavier.)  6)  Can you feel the love tonight  - Elton John (a song from Lion King? Simba and Nala were nuzzling to it for chrissakes! I can't listen to it without thinking of lions mating in the Kalahari desert!)  7)  Take my breath away  - Berlin (Tom Cruise is a turn-off. And the song itself is very reminiscent of smoky hash-joint settings.)  8)  Nothing's gonna change my love for you  - George Benson (unheard of, until Monte Carlo pullovers used it for their TV ad. Till then, every love song collection manufactured by Archies greeting cards company has featured this song prominently.)  Yeah and the ones who've heard a little more will throw in the occasional  Always , by Bon Jovi,  Iris  by the Goo goo dolls, or even Clapton's  Wonderful Tonight . And the list goes on.   Then I thought - what if I were to burn a CD of my favourite love songs? And I came up with some names. These again, are subject to change, but since they're the only ones I could name off-the-cuff, I guess they mean something to me.   1) Third Eye Blind - Deep Inside of You 2) Drops of Jupiter - Train 3) I will do anything for love - John Meatloaf 4) November Rain - GnR 5) One more night - Phil Collins 6) Hole in my Soul - Aerosmith 7) Wonderwall - Oasis 8) It ain't over till it's over - Lenny Kravitz 9) Bringing on the Heartbreak - Def Leppard 10) Every rose has its thorn - Poison 11) Simply the best - Tina Turner  Check out some of their lyrics sometimes. Makes a WORLD of sense. At least to fucked-by-love people like me :-)  Right, I'm very tired and overworked. I need the weekend. See you guys!

      Once a guy I knew was in his computer science class and everybody was talking and making noise etc. The the teacher said out loud "Dogs don't have sex, they FUCK!" Suddenly everybody in the whole class went quiet and turned to look at why the lady had gone bonkers. And the teacher said "now that we have everybody's attention, let's get back to work."  So, now that I've got all your attention, I will go on to list a number of ideologies that are ruling my life nowadays.   1) Definition is Denial.  The moment you define boundaries - for yourself, or your relationships, you are closing doors. SO don't define boundaries, just let everything flow.    2) Aisa koi nasha na karo jo waqt ke saath utar jaye.   Corny, but true. Don't drink, don't smoke, don't do drugs and substances. Get addicted to music, literature, ideas, love, and people.   3) I'm bold as love.   I love the people around me. I love my friends and family. I'm glad I loved the men I ever did. Love is a bold sentiment, and I'm proud that I'm able to express it, to people. It makes me happy to say that.    4) Surround yourself with excellence - for mediocrity is death.  Whenever I can, I surround myself with excellence - good people, good books, good music, good conversation. I don't want stagnation, and I cannot bear to see myself living a mundane existence. I want to do a lot of things, learn new stuff, meet exciting people. I want to be in organic relationships - where both people give and receive and grow as entities.   Hmm that's all I can think of right now. I'm going now.

      Hey I've got a neat idea. Let's do a reverse survey kind of thing. Of course it would be relevant only to people who read my blog.  1) What do you think my favorite magazine is? 2) Can anybody tell what hot drink I drink most? 3) My favorite TV show?  Hmmm. That's it I think. Three questions are good enough. Because you know... it's really more fun for me to see what people think than people to answer them. And also, I didn't really want to put fact-based questions. Although I guess, I did.   I mostly wanted to come up with a couple of questions that would have said what people thought I'd do or think and compare with what I thought I'd do or think. Anyway, that would in someway give me insights about myself.... you know to see what projection I give. But I couldn't come up with many good questions.   Oh oh... here's one. Do you think I believe in hypnotism?  Come on! tell me what you think!

      Marriage. Hmmm... lots of stuff about marriage and gay marriage (I don't really like the term 'gay'. Because 'gay' means happy. Not that "gays" are not happy, but "gay" has nothing to do with same-sex couples, you know?).  I've read lots of stuff about marriage ... mostly centered around saying that the marriage is a religious institution. Religions therefore are welcome to decide who they should marry and who they wouldn't (the sex, the number of people in one marriage, etc.) Governments should have legal contracts and should be blind as to who's in that contract. Two separate entities - a religious one, and a legal one.  So I don't really have anything new to say there... for the most part. Except that I do now want to question the very existence of this notion of "marriage." For some this would be too radical a question, for some not.   I can already see some people saying "what's to be expected of you? you're a woman without beliefs!" Tsk... I keep hearing this over... that I am without beliefs. What does it mean anyway? I'd just like to insert one word in their sentences: 'without stupid beliefs" or even "without beliefs without reason." But that would be a different entry.  Anyway... coming back to the topic. Marriage. Hmmm. Well, see in the days of Old, people used to be single. They got married under the auspices of a religion. THEN they had sex. Then they had children. And they lived... sometimes happily, other times not so happily ever after. Repeat for every subsequent generation.  This format worked till about 60-70 years ago generally all around the world. Then the Western world had a sex revolution. Plenty sex outside of marriage gained acceptance. The abrogation of marriages became socially accepted. Fast forward a couple of decades: "single parents" came into being. It's socially acceptable to have children without being in a marriage (and the kids, most appropriately, aren't called 'bastards' and treated as outcasts, anymore). And it's accepted to raise children with just one parental unit or two unmarried different-sex parental units (we aren't there with two same-sex parental units being socially accepted yet). De Facto relationships came into being. You only need to live together and so long as you do the same stuff as any married couple does, you're okay.   So recounting again, you don't need to be in a marriage to have sex, have babies, raise children, and live... in general. Marriage, ladies and gentlemen, is dead.   *** A number of years ago, I was talking with a friend about "engagements." And engagements to me, at that point in time, were also strange. I was like... that's not an engagement, it's a marriage. It's all one and the same. You're "married" when you accept the obligations of being married, and just for the sake of record, you signal that intention publicly in front of few people. That's all you need.   A couple of years after that, but still almost about 2 years ago, I was talking with my father about weddings and marriage. I told him, like hell I was ever going to through religious mumbo jumbo in the form of a marriage. A civil contract of law, that's what I wanted!  If you indeed WANT to go through religious, cultural motions or rituals - that's one thing. But it doesn't really do anything, AND, it's not something you "need" in this day and age.   Marriage is an outdated, archaic, anachronistic idea.

LAYER 2:  Your heritage: what's this supposed to mean anyway? And oh such big a situation...! Your weakness: Sure I'm weak in lots of places. For starters, I'd like to be able to more flexible.

Your perfect pizza: I haven't really thought about it. But my most consistent topping is smoked chicken! Goal you'd like to achieve: I'd just like to do something good, you know? For society! I can't really figure out how I could do anything really.  LAYER 3:  Your most overused phrase in AIM: None lately. Your thoughts first waking up: What time is it? Where's my cigarette?  Your bedtime: it varies.   LAYER 4:  Pepsi or Coke: Thums Up actually. When I was in college, Pepsi paid the college loads of money to sell only pepsi... so we were drinking pepsi under duress :-) Single or group dates: Oh, I have a joke about this.

Even if I think about a perfect guy, I'd not think about eye color. Best hair color?  ditto Short or long hair: ditto Height:  ditto Best weight: I'd think about being healthy (which doesn't mean that you're so thin you could evaporate). But I don't. I don't really think about the perfect guy. Best articles of clothing: ditto. Best first date location: Oh come ON! Best first kiss location: See above.  LAYER 10:  # of people I could trust with my life: That number is dwindling everyday, and I'm sad about it. # of CDs that I own: like real branded CDs? I dunno... 9 or 10? # of piercings: my two ears. # of tattoos: None so far, I'm still considering it, though. # of scars on my body: scars? are we supposed to count injuries? A couple from kiddie days, I suppose. Although I think I have scar tissue (from an accident) on my elbow... pains like hell sometimes when I put too much pressure on it.  The End!

      Last night my friend for the last fourteen years arrived at 9.30 pm. I was doing the dishes in the sink, the maid had not arrived because of the Bandh and I was helping Mum (for a change, instead of sitting and playing intellectual queen-bee). So he gets into the kitchen and says - "I need to talk to you, I'm in deep trouble."  At this moment, I guessed the obvious. He is just back from Hyderabad after meeting his girlfriend, so I put on my police-interrogation look and said, "She's pregnant, right?" At which he said NO, but that they had been in a huge fight and he was at the risk of losing her forever.  The issue, dear readers, was TRIVIAL. He had promised her that he was going to quit smoking, but he had not kept his promise (hah, he and I shared a cigarette as part of our bonding ritual when I came here), worse, he had TOLD his girlfriend that! So now his lady is angry with him because not only had he "faltered at his promise which goes to show that I cannot trust you anymore," but also, "You have smoked with HER? What IS it between the two of you?"  Ahem, yeah right.   So... in order to help my distraught friend, i tried various approaches -   I tried the Smirk -  "What is it, bad time of the month for her or something? And hey, promises-shmomises!! If Eve hadn't broken her promise, you and I wouldn't be here! So good you broke the promise. Hhhmmmppphhh!"  I tried the Agony Aunt -  "Are you sure you ready for this? Like you're comfortable with your relationship being judged on a ten-point scale all the time? Is this what, a checklist thing? Smokes no, no-smokes yes? Sheesh, a relationship is all about being comfortable, and drawing comfort from, so if this is causing you tension, it's probably not worth it, you maybe want to think twice."  I even tried the whole philosophy thing (my favourite, this)-  "What's the big deal? Why are you scared to be alone? What is this aching need for companionship? Do you need approval? Try to be alone, ask yourself questions, see the answers emerge. Explore pain..explore deep deep pain."  But no, nothing worked. Everytime I expounded one of my earth-shattering theories, he would only look at me, droop and wilt a little further, and ask, "But is she going to come back?"  At one point, I just lit my cigarette, blew a mouthful of smoke at him, and told him something like,  "Yeah she will, they all come back."  (Corny now, but when I said it, I thought it carried a lot of impact.  So now that the story's over, my question is, why are some (most?) people so afraid of a break-up? Last year, I split with someone after four years. It was painful, I was a nervous wreck, on the verge of tears 24x7. I spent months living like that. Now, I'm determined not to give anyone that spot in my life anymore.   You know, from basically where they can drive a dagger through you and then turn it around a few times, just to see how much you cringe and tear :-)  Hmmm.   But then yes, I would like to know the whole deal. Is it because we make that *someone* a center of our universe, so that when they're no longer there, the whole world comes crashing down? Or is it a deeper need for companionship? And the real story is that no one wants to be alone. Ever.  So many songs written, so much literature, so much popular culture - is about break-ups. But nothing really gives the straight dope.  Will somebody please explain this to me?

      Warm humid Calcutta morning. Today is a Bangla bandh called by Mamata Banerjee's party. This also coincides with a 36-hour taxi strike. Picture this - Monday morning, everyone's relaxed, no traffic on the streets, children playing cricket on the main roads. Yes, I needed to experience a bona fide Calcutta bandh again.   More about the weekend. On Saturday, I met Ravi Handa, young promising IIT-KGPian who gave me nine seasons of Seinfeld and all albums of Pink Floyd on CD. My entertainment needs for the next five years are taken care of. The deal with Ravi was that I treat him to lunch and movie and he gives me the CDs. So we entered this restaurant on Park Street called Peter Cat. In my usual unending quest for innovation, I ordered Chicken Marakesh, and was served a plate of butter-cubes-on-rice-boiled vegetables-seekh-kabaab-chicken-tikka (phew!!). Ravi decided to stick to his Punjabi roots and opted for Chicken Korma and Butter Naan. That done, we hopped over to watch Monster. Amazing film, Charlize Theron (even overweight and mottled skin) rocks as ever.   In the evening I met my friends and visited Someplace Else, the pub at the Park Hotel. Aerosmith playing, dimly lit pub, teeming with faces and cigarette smoke. I kind of liked the ambience but there was no place to sit. So we went to Sheesha, the famous Hookkah bar of Calcutta. One look at the menu card and I was floored. Hookkahs of every conceivable flavour - peach, lemon, mint, strawberry - for 400 bucks an hour. Looked enticing, but I thought that cigarettes give me a good enough high, and opted out. Also spotted a cigar section on the menu - one Cuban cost Rs 1995! Woh!  I'm still feeling somewhat depressed. Maybe the endless Floyd is doing it in. Also, the holidays are coming to an end. Next Monday, I'll be back at work at this time. Yet another Calcutta holiday, over. When will I see these people again? For all my cribbing and whining, I grew up in this city and I love her. Yes, she's dying, and yes, the Left Front has fucked her nice and royal. But she remains charming and warm, and she remains my birthplace and my home.  *sigh*  I'm signing off people.
