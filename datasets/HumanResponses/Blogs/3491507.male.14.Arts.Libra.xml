      its now 7:19 and i'm listening to make up, or wig in a box from the musical, Hedwig And The Angry Inch, i'm not sure if i've told you about it already but any way its a romantic, dramatic, comedic, musical journey through a little german boy named hansel's life. It all starts when Hansel is laying on a bomb crater that he's found near home. sun bathing naked, face down. (in east berlin, at this time the wall is erected) and an American G.I, Sgt. Luther Robinson, who is obviosly trying to abduct poor little hansel. Luther: Girl, I sure don't mean to annoy you but, My name is Sgt. Luther Robinson. (Hansel turns over revealing his penis, or his "little bishop in a turtle neck" Hansel: I'm Hansel. Luther is silent and then offers him candy, he takes it runs off, and goes back the next day to find Luther, luther tells him he loves him, they get married after, Hansel gets a botched sex change operation, Hense the "Angry inch", Luther leaves him, hansel finds a boy named tommy, they colaborate and make music, tommy runs off after finding Hansels (now hedwig, using his mothers name) inch and uses his music to becaome a rock and roll icon, and hedwig shadows his tour with his band "the angry inch". GO BUY IT GOD DAMMIT!
