						     Alas, and the day is come to an end. Isn't it peculiar that sometimes, that something will happen, or you will do something; but you can't really quite remember all of it? That it will come to you as a dream. You know it is real, but you can't recall all of it. They seem so close, yet so distant. You long to grasp them; but you can't hold them, you can only get lost in recalling them; wishing you could relive that moment over and over; wishing you could be there one last time; wishing you knew what the future was going to reveal. Why can't moments like that last forever? Why do they pass so quickly? I only hope that soon another will come. I only wish I could express my feelings better. I only wish...

						     Today's been rainy, but Bon and I walked anyway. Thankfully we didn't get lost. That would have been kinda funny though. But yeah. I was fun, even with the rain. There was this cool ledge that we walked by, and sorta climbed on. It was a dry place to sit for a little bit. Then we just decided to walk, even though the rain picked up a bit. We got soaking wet, but it was fun all the same. I enjoyed it muchly.

						     I may not get to write anything tomorrow. I'm walking with Bon in the morning. That means I have to get up early, ugh. But she's worth it : ). Then in the evening we're going to have a whatever get-together thingy at the Brodie's. That has "staying up late" written all over it. Well, I guess I'm going to head out to catch some z's for tomorrow.

						    I'm just kinda sitting here, chatting on IM. I'm not too sure why I'm making this "post", but I am. Why does no one ever talk to me on IM? There is like, only one person that will actually talk to me, and that's Bonny. All other conversations I have to start myself. I feel so unloved sometimes... It's not like anyone's going to read this anyway. I doubt anyone will actually look at my profile, much less my blog, whatever blog's supposed to mean... *sigh*

						     Today was rather an interesting day, other than the fact I had to study Greek all day. Wow, a whole bunch of fun there. Well, it is sorta fun sometimes.

						     Each day I come closer to that which I dread. Time never seems to pass fast enough when you need it to; but when you want it to go slow, it just goes all the faster.    Why is it that when something good     happens, it is taken away?   With all that changes,      moods shift from day to day.   When things seem to work out,     and life starts to go good,   Something always happens,      and it gets worse than you thought it could.      ~anonymous

						     Yeah, we had a lock-in at church last night/this morning. It was pretty fun. I ended up bowling better with my left hand than my right... that's just kinda weird. By the end I was exausted. I slept till nearly four in the afternoon today... and I'm still tired; well, sorta. It's most likely just because I had slept that long. Played some mean Halo. Won half of the games that I played in. Got second in the rest. I helped Kenneth and Seth out when they were playing. I think I play that game way too good. They kept saying it was suicide to play against the Skippers. I probably shouldn't play it as much as I do, but hey; it's a really fun game. Oh well. That's enough typing for now. I have to get ready to go to eat at Zaxby's. I love David, he always manages to convince the parents to eat out. Well, that's not the only reason I love my bro, but yeah.

						     All this is rather new to one as myself. Bear with me as I slowly accumulate random information for the entertainment of those like yourself that find joy in reading that which other people write... wow, that's a mouthful. Anyway, like I said, all this is rather new. Don't count on something being written every day, because I most likely won't be able to think of stuff to write that often.

						     Chocolate is good for the mind. A shower is good for the body. And sleep is good for the soul. Those three things are the key to recovery from anything. My friends, I am not the only one who advocates this philosophy. Many others have found, and now utilize, its power to heal. Consult your friends, spread the word, take hold of the simplistic power to recover from hurts only you yourself can mend. Find it in yourself. I shall part by saying this proverb in the ancient Greek tongue, "Ekeis kalan haymeran". Which, in simple terms for the laymen, it holds the meaning: "have a good day".

						     well, today was, well, it was... um, rather uneventful. Nothing really cool happened today. I got to talk to Bonny, that's always good. More school. Fun stuff there. At church, the speaker guy never ceased smiling. It bugged me. He woulda made a good car salesman. But yeah. I walked home from church and saw a shooting star. That was cool. It was a nice one too. Really long and bright. Well kiddos, I think I'm off. Don't hurt yourselves.

						     sup dudes. Not too much happened yesterdy. I did get to talk to Bonny though, so that was good. I'm glad that we can still talk to each other. It makes me happy. Well, we started school yesterday. No real fun in that. It's pretty simple so far though. I hope it stays that way. Today was pretty average in itself. I did get to talk to Bon again. I guess that's the third day in a row, now. It most likely won't stay that way, though, unfortunately. But yeah. School was pretty strait forward today too. No real news. Well, I think I'm going to go because I don't have anything else to say.

						      Hey you guys. I didn't get to blog last night because I wasn't here. Yesterday was a rather sad day: Bonny headed off to Freed. I got up early so I could see her off. Got there and helped her get some stuff organized and in the Escape. She gave me a couple pillows. One was a micro-bean pillow. That thing is cool. It's really weird, but cool. And the other is a crocheted pillow she made for me. I absolutely love it! And it makes it all the more special that she made it herself. I'm going to treasure it forever and ever... that's a long time. But yeah. She headed off. They were only half an hour behind schedule, so that's good I guess  . On the way there to Bon's house I saw a Plymouth Prowler. That's a cool car. Don't see that many of 'em. They're kinda interesting, and very unique looking.   After I got back home from Bonny's house I ate lunch, broke down, and took a nap. I was exausted. Dad fixed the baptistry from where it had overflown. Actually, it was Adam and dad. Adam needed the help, because it wasn't really a one-person job. So they did that. That night, after I got up from my really long nap we had some company over. It was Anthony and his girlfriend, Devin, Mrs. Donna, and us. It wasn't a huge group, but our house isn't really the biggest house, so groups can feel real big real fast.   After the meal, I headed out to Devin's house because he invited me over there to play D&D. I ended up spending the night. Anthony was there. Well, duh, he's Devin's roommate. Chris Meacham came and hung out and played with us. We played until around 1:00 or so. I slept on the couch. It's actually a pretty good couch to sleep on, but I didn't sleep that well since Bonny had just left that morning, so that was weighing heavy on me.   This morning I got up around 8:00 or so to be able to get a shower in time to leave for church. It ended up that Devin took a little longer than he wanted to so I ended up leaving my stuff at his house for lack of time to put it in the car. Morning services were really different without Bonny. I missed her singing next to me, then I started to think about her and came close to breaking down in the middle of the opening song. That would have been awkward.   After church we went home to eat, although I really wanted to go out somewhere. When I ate I went back to Devin's to get my stuff I left at his house. I got there and knocked on the door; no answer. A couple minutes, knock and no answer. I did that about like, five or six times and decided then to just walk on in. Turns out that he had been sleeping. But I got my stuff and left him to his sleep. After I got home, I left with dad and Dave and played disc golf. I had a bad game as usual, but it was fun anyway.   While we were disc-golfing, Bonny called. So I called her back when I got home. I had to leave a message on her answering machine. Then she finally got ahold of me and we got to talk, although it was only for a couple minutes because there was something she had to go to. But at least we got to talk alittle: )   Church tonight was youth night. Joseph Kelly did the sermon. I led a song. Number 23: Our God He is alive. I love that song. I guess I did ok considering two different people told me I pitched it perfectly. So that was cool. Brandon made me commit to doing song leading at L2L. Maybe I'll do ok in that. Anyway. After church a small group of us went to BK to grab a bite. I was going to walk home, but Brandon made me ride with him. Oh well. I'm going to walk home one of these days. I will, I promise myself that. That's pretty much it for yesterday and today. Wow, I never knew I would ever be able to write this much. crazy.

						      Sup yall. Today started off with me being so peacefully being awakened by... the freakin' telephone. No one answered it, so it just rang and rang and rang and rang, etc. But yeah. I just layed there hoping to fall asleep, but I didn't. So I stuck a cd in my cd player and just lay there listening to music. After about five or six songs I decided to just get up. So I did. Then Karen and Mrs. Donna left to go pick up Anthony at the airport because he flew in today. But it turned out that his plane didn't get here until late in the afternoon. But he made it. So that's good.  Oh, I finished my book today. The dirty worded one. Midway. It was pretty good overall, but the language really really bugged me. You can't read over that crap. You'll try to skip it and just run into it a couple of words later. I can say from imediate experience that the whole "you are what you watch, or read, etc." is very true. A couple of times I caught myself before I said something that I shouldn't. It's bad, I know very well. ugh. It makes me mad that I had to read that. I need something to clear my mind of all that filth.   Anyway. Today my computer (I say my computer. It's not really mine, but you know what I mean) locked up for absolutely no reason at all. Dad looks at something on the internet, closes the window, and the computer freezes. Then I called it a bloody piece of junk. It's not very nice, I know, but it frustrated me because I was trying to do stuff on it. It's so old. We really need to update it and our operating system. We still have Windows 98 for cryin' out loud. '98 was like, six or so years ago. That's a long time when it comes to computers. Well, I guess it works for now I guess. I can do what I want on it. At least we have a computer.   I played this weird game today. It was some online game called Rune Sword or Rune Search or Rune Somethin' or other. Like every peron on the screen was an actual person, except a handful of NPC's (that's Non-Player Character's for the un-informed as to what that meant). I walked around aimlessly. The quest I was supposed to do was confusing, and I had no clue where to go. I traded everything I had to this one guy cause I was really bored. Then I begged the surrounding people to kill me... no one did. So I just closed the window in utter boredom and got back online and talked to people and checkded my email like I always do.    Tonight was the TNT. Well, I'm not sure if was a TNT or just an areawide. It was hard to surmise. I heard it called both. Anyway. It wasn't anything special. I ate more than I usually do at things of that sort. That was weird. Oh, and there was this weird little girl that kept wanting to take people to "jail". She dragged me off (almost literally) to her place that she designated as jail where stood Chris and this other girl. After standing there for like, thirty seconds, I plotted a deversion and let the girl escape; and while the Jail-master Nazi-girl was quarreling with Chris, I made a run for it. Then after a couple of minutes she persued me and chase me around the house like, three times. whew. It was crazy. Then there was the devo... First, the singing wasn't up to par. I couldn't sing with Matt and Chris standing right behind me, and the speaker system was inadequate so we couldn't hear the song leader. Then the speaker gave a really long spill that involved alot of boats, water, and life-lines; I'm not too sure, my mind kinda wandered and my legs were about to fall off having to stand up the whole time. Afterwards we got on the buses and went back to the church. From there I drove Bon home, came back here, checked my email, IMed some people, wrote this, and listened to some music. I had better head out now. It's nearly 12:00 and I'm going to get up early to see Bonny off tomorrow. Blog to you guys later.

						      yeah. today's been pretty good. I got up at around 9:30 or 10:00. Karen said that we would soon have to start getting up at more reasonable times because we would have to start doing school. That's not any fun there. Afterwards Karen and Mrs. Donna went to eat at a luncheon with some of the ladies of our church. David and I were home alone again while they were gone. We didn't do anything bad or evil or anything menacing in any way, so that was good. It was weird today, the phone practically didn't stop ringing. Man, it was crazy. My grandmother in Nebraska, whom I haven't talk to in like a year or so (the reason of which is a whole story in itself), called. That was kinda weird and unexpected. She talked a pretty good bit. Whew, can she talk. But like I said, it was kinda weird.   I read a whole lot today. I'm reading the book  Midway . They cuss a whole stinkin' lot in that book. man. They've said d*** a billion times. sh** a whole bunch. let's see. Both of the B words many times. And they have said the F word like, at least four times, if not six or seven. It's bad. And also they use God's name in vain way way too much. They have said hell in a bad context a multiplicity of times, too. I hope my speaking isn't compromised by having to read such filth. ugh. Makes me want to eat marshmellows. That's kinda random, but for some reason it does. yeah.   Also today, our dog wouldn't stop whining and begging. It got kinda annoying after awhile. Silly dog. Dad had went out and payed her alot of attention, Karen had went out and paid her alot of attention, Dave and I did, she got a treat, she got to go for a walk; you'd think she wouldn't. Crazy. But after a while she stopped. Not sure what suddenly made her do it, but she did. The cat never meows or scratches the door or anything. He almost never even meows. Every now and then he does, but he usually has to go take a nap because it uses up so much energy. That's our cat for ya: lazy beyond belief.   I also fixed my chair today. There was a little piece that was sticking out, so I figured a way to put it back on. I hit my finger though. Oh, and I also fixed our sink bowl. It was out of alignment, so I pushed it back and one of the fasteners fell off. So I put that back on and then tightened it and the other three. I didn't have a screwdriver with me, so I had to do it with my bare hands, so I wasn't able to get them as tight as they could have been tightened. But at least it's on there now.   This evening, Bonny and I got to spend some time together. So that was good. We decided how, for now, our relationship is going to progress. We're going to continue as we are and see how that goes; which, I hope, goes well. It'll be different not having her around, but I think I can manage knowing that we're still together. Well, I think I'm going to head off. Talk to all yall guys later.

						    Tonight was pretty fun. We found that the baptistry had flooded, and subsequently poured water all over the place. So I was one who helped move stuff so that they could clean up the water. It was a mess.       I bought some shorts today. They were on sale, and I needed some, so I got 'em. I have to pay Karen back because she bought them for me because I had spent all my money getting stuff for Bonny. While we were out, Mrs. Donna bought us lunch, partly because I am letting her use my room so she wanted to do something for me. So that was cool. We ate at Sonic. She said that they don't have Sonics in Iowa. That's weird.       After church this evening I took Bonny home and spent some time with her, but Seth had to bring David. ugh. They can be so annoying. Here it's like, three days before Bonny has to leave, and they are being a freakin' pain in the butt. I am very perturbed at them both right now. At least I got to spend some time with Bon.       hmm. I think that's pretty much it. I can't think of anything else, but if I do, I'll be sure to add it.       **end of message**

						     Man, why does everyone have to be in school. It's so boring when there's no one to talk to.  I have yet to start school yet, so that's good at least. but oh well, I guess I'll have to be bored until someone gets home from school and online... or until church.

						     Went ice skating this afternoon. That was fun. It hurt though. haha. I think I fell like, 4 or 5 times. Well, those were full blown wipe outs. If you count the just kinda falls, then it's like 7 or 8 times. But yeah. It was fun none the less. oh Bonny, awwww! haha. That's an inside thing for those that went skating with us. Man, that can get annoying. Oh well. Grin and bear it, that's what I say. Anyway. Oh yeah, sorry Julie, but everyone will find out anyway. Julie locked her purse in her car with her keys in it at Bon's house. That was funny. So I had to drive everyone and then let her get her key and drive her back to Bon's go get her car. Then we all (Bonny, Julie, and David) went back home (my house) to eat dinner; sortof a birthday dinner for Dave. yeah. That was fun. We sang the birthday song to him like, a bagillion times. Then we made him blush alot. That's so fun. It's rather mean, but fun. Julie thinks it's funny, so it's all good. Afterwards, Bon and I went and watched a movie at her house. That was fun. Then I came home and now am writing this. This morning Dad took Dave out to lunch for his birthday, so David didn't get to get his liscence today, wasn't enough time; so he's going to try to get it tomorrow. yeah... it's a little scary. He's not really that bad of a driver, so I'm not worried. Well, I had best get to bed because I am tired beyond all reason. Talk to all yall tomorrow it being as tomorrow is Wednesday and all. I'm going to be so sore in the morning...

						     Ok, the dream started off with me and my secret group of spys based in a hotel. Our position is found out so Todd, my second hand man, and I go and check things out. I fall behind and arrive in just enough time to see him get gunned down by two of LB's henchmen. (Laura Beth was the head of the bad guy secret police). After an ensuing gunbattle, I am taken captive. About the time that she finishes questioning me, the rest of my spys come out and are quickly subdued and captured. Then LB orders them to be executed, shoots me in the head, laughs an evil laugh, and drives off in her black bullet-proof Jaguar.

						     Yep, that's how my day started. I got up at 12 or so, ate breakfast, then headed off to go shopping. I was getting stuff for Bon, so I can't elaborate any further in case she reads. I really wish she didn't have to go. *sigh*. Anyway. After shopping, I doodled a little bit. Well, I call it doodling. Some would call it drawing, but that's irrelevant. Our school books came in today, total bummer there. I guess we're probably starting next week. I'm going ice skating with Bonny tomorrow. Dave and Julie may come. But yeah. I've never ice skated before. I'm looking forward to it. man, David's going to be 16 tomorrow. My little brother is growing up... haha. yeah. that's perty much it fer right now.

						     Sup guys. It's been a couple days since I've posted last. but yeah. We had the Bible Bowl cook-out thing last night. It was fun. Mr. Entriken (or however you spell it), taught our class this morning. I guess that Brandon is gone somewheres or something. Yeah. After church we went to Greenbriar Bar-b-que, because Mrs. Donna is here. She's here because Anthony is coming back from Iraq. So that's cool and all. Greenbriar is awesome. Really good. When we got there though, we got there at 1:00 and there were like a billion people in front of us. So we had to wait for the like, ten groups of two, the group of 20, the group of 7, and some other group. It took awhile, and I hadn't eaten breakfast. Talk about agony. oh well, I'm fine now. Bible Bowl study started today. Fun stuff there. Yeah... We have a whole stinkin' bunch a guys in our class. They're all at that age that they think that they are really cool, but in reality they are totally not. More like, really annoying. Well, we have them and Chris; but it's hard to make a distinction at times. ugh. Chris made me  really  perturbed today in BB class. We were talking and Chris said that he had "hired servants" (we were on that topic) because he had some kids at his school doing his homework for him (which probably isn't true anyway). But then Dad said that that wasn't really a good thing for him to do. Then Chris, and I quote, said, "Well I'm taking a college level history class, bud." And I'm like (to myself) "Bud?  BUD ?! That's my   Dad   you're talkin' to!!" I so wanted to beat his face in right then; but I didn't say anything; I held back. UGH. He has no respect. And he's all bragging about driving before David was. And Dave and I are like, "no, David got his permit before you". And then he starts on this whole "I was driving before I got my permit" thing; which probably isn't true, but still. I hate those people that think they know everything and try to tell you that you don't know what the crap you're talking about, when in reality, they are the one that has no stinkin' clue. They make me so freakin' frustrated. Ok, I'm starting to get a little fired up. I had better stop.

						     played doom 3. it has some wickedly awesome graphics. they're super detailed. it's a pretty gorey game though. egh. and scary too. demons and zombies poppin' up everywhere. man, i couldn't play the actual game. whew. but multi-player was fun. i kicked some tail in that... well, i did ok. not too bad, though. well, i'd best be off.

						     Today I didn't really do too much. Did some Greek, fried a couple of eggs for lunch. Yeah. I beat Peasant's Quest, this really cool game (haha). This evening, as the title suggests, I played disc golf. I had an ok game, nothin' special. I have decided that my glove that I wear isn't the super glove of power, but more of a glove of random luck. Every shot I really tried to do good on turned out bad; but any shot that I just kinda tossed ended up exactly perfect. It was rather interesting. But yeah. Afterward we went to Wal-Mart and bought some ice cream. It's like, cherry cordial's in chocolate truffle ice cream with ameretto. Does that not sound completely awesome?! I can't wait to dive in. After I eat my ice cream, I am going with Devin to play Doom 3, a game that is supposed to be a super-cool, neato, sweet game. I'll probably be up near to all night; who knows. It doesn't really matter because I don't have too much of a reason to be here since Bon isn't home tonight. Well, I'm off to eat some ice cream.

						     Went to the mall today with Bon, Seth, and their mom, like I said last night that I was. I had a good time. Everytime's a good time with Bonny. Anyway. yeah. I got Dave a gift, but just in case he reads this, I won't elaborate. But yeah. It has been awhile since I have walked that mall so extensively. I'm not too much of a mall kinda guy. Well, I'm not sure if there are too many guys that like the mall. I talked to a guy outside the ladies dressing room (don't get any bad ideas; I was waiting for Bon). Anyway, we talked about the differences of shopping between girls and guys. Ok, girls have to look (and try on) everything  before  they can decide what they want. A guy looks only at what he wants (sometimes brousing), and then tries on what he has picked  after  he has decided what he wants. Now I know perfectly well that there are exceptions, depending on what is being shopped for, etc.; and also that there are girls and guys that are different. But on average, that's about how it runs. That's thoroughly unimportant, but I needed something to write. All I'm trying to say is that I talked to a guy that I didn't even know. I don't do that much. I guess I should try to be more "outgoing" or "friendly" or whatever you want to call it. We also talked about school. He was interested to the fact that I was home schooled. I didn't think to ask his name. He didn't either, so that's probably why. But yeah. We went to Wal-Mart after we left the mall. Loads of fun there. I love Wally World. Such a great place. Well, I'm getting tired, and plus I'm out of stuff to type, so

						     Tonight was rather fun. Went to the baby shower. Listened to Craig Lamb give a lesson. He did a great job. It was on the song  It is Well with my Soul.  That's a real good song. I like it. We sang it like, a billion times. Ok, so maybe only thrice (that's fancy for three). It has a sad story behind it though. I had heard it before, but had forgotten about it. I would say it, but I don't really feel like typing that much right now. But yeah. After church my parents left me. I was ok with walking home; but Bon offered to take me home, so I couldn't turn her down: you know how that is,... well, maybe you don't. Anyways. Tomorrow I'm goin' shoppin' er somethin' of that sort with Bonny. I'm not too much into shopping, but I only have so much time with her before she leaves. Hey, shopping can be fun! Maybe I'll see something I need. hmm, is there anything that I need? I'm not too sure. I'd have to think a while and look at my wardrobe. I do want to see the price that trenchcoats are going for these days. I want one. I most likely won't be able to find one though, knowing my luck. Wait a second! I could get David a birthday gift! his birthday is only a few days away. But I'm not sure what he wants. I'll have to ask him. ... hmm, what would Dave want...? Well, I guess I'll find out tomorrow. Man, I can't believe he's going to be 16. He's going to be driving by himself within two weeks (provided he don't fail the drivers test). Anyway. I had best be off to bed. I have to go on a Z hunt. There's no better place than my lovely bed hunt down those Z's... man, why am I so weird? Maybe it's that I'm tired. Maybe not. Well, I'll go on that one for right now.

						     I almost got rearended by a pick-up this evening. I was stopping for a guy turning left in front of me, but the dude behind me wasn't paying attention and ended up having to swerve off the road and then ended up in the grass beside me. Wow. That got my heart to beating. But no one was harmed, so it's all good.

						     No, blueberries as nothing to do with anything. I just wanted to put that as the title. anyway. Today has been rather uneventful thus as far. But tonight oughta be fun. Bon and I are watching a movie; Bourne Identity. It was a pain in the butt to find. First I went to a couple places. The first place was so disorganized it was pathetic. Then the next place had it, but all copies were rented. Then I got back home, and thought of another place, but Karen wouldn't let me go. She didn't want me to use the gas when I could just call them. So then I had to go and find the place in the phone book, and call. Well, they're number was "unable to be reached" or something along those lines. Well, finally Karen found a place that had it. But you have to be 18 or older to rent or get a membership thingy, so then we had to work out a plan to get it. yeah. It was rather a pain. But now we're going to get the movie, and Bon and I are going to watch it, and it'll all be good. Well, that's all for now.

						     Welp. Today is just another day among days. Went to the bear stuffing whatever thing this morning. Yeah buddy. I had a blast!!.... uhh, not. But yeah. That's about it. Did more Greek. Worked on my D&amp;D character. yeah. I have such a boring life. I won't say it's bad per say, but it is rather boring at times. I want to play Halo... that was random. Oh well. I guess I'll stop typing now.

						     Today was a pretty great day. Well, I started off going to church, obviously... We had a buncha visitors this morning. Five I think. Anyway. After morning services we went over to the Brodies for a cookout/devo. It was crazy. On the way there I hit every possible red light on red... except the one where I had to turn right. Figures. But yeah. The cookout was fun. The burger was a little on the done side (aka burnt) but it was still rather good. I played alot of chess. I beat Rachel. And then brutally annihilated Kenneth. Then there was Fannie Mare. We were trying to teach her how to play. Well, she beat me. That's most likely do to the fact that she had like, thirty people giving her tips and hints. Ok, maybe only four or five; but still, that's alot of people to be playing against. She couldn't make a bad move. Well, the second game went pretty much the same way. I was down to three pieces. Then she  finally  made a mistake, and within three moves I had her in check-mate. But yeah. We sang some songs and had a devo. Then we watched a slide show of some of the summer. It was kinda short, but oh well, it happens. That's about it for the cookout. Well, for evening services, Jason preached. It was good. He had a picture of him "extending discipline", or whatever, on me. (he was knee-ing me in the stomach (it was posed (duh))) ANYway... After church we all had to say buy to Austin and Morgan. Man, I really wish they didn't have to go. ugh. But yeah. Then Julie & Dave and Bon &amp; I watched a movie. Confesions of a Teenage Drama Queen. Funny here and there. I wouldn't choose to watch it again. But yeah. It's all in the company. Well, that's today and it's events.
