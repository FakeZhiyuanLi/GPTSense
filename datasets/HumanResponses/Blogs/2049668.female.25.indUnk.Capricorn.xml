      Today was blah day.  Dylan stayed home from school because he had 2 asthma attacks this morning.  I slept half the day because I didnt feel good.  Still no results from the doctors office.... I stitched a little today while the kids were watching TV, worked for a little bit and now I think Im going to attempt to find the kitchen counter again. Nothing to exciting going on around here.

      Wednesday Oct 8, 2003 Well what a hectic day! Got up early got Dylan off to school, got ready for my appt for my ultrasound thinking oh this will be fast like 20 minutes.....UGH over an HOUR it took! and I hadnt been aloud to eat or drink anything since last night for it.  So by time I was done I was hungry.  My mom took me and we figured we'd go get some breakfast....well, we had to go pick up my grandmother (who was in a mood today from being taken off a medication she had been on after her brain surgery) and take her to the bank so she could get money out, shes too stubborn to get a debit card or anything, for a trip she is taking to her brothers.  So we get her, go to a restaurant sitting eating, enjoying my lunch (yes it got to be lunchtime!) and cell phone goes off...frantic hubby on other end...WHERE ARE YOU? I said Im eating Ill be home soon whats wrong? He proceeds to tell me to go pick up Dylan from school a bunch of kids from his class got sick.  So okay Im half done get a box the check and leave....grandmother had to go home first of course, then to the school.  3 kids today out of his classroom SICK like all of sudden PALE and throwing up, Dylan was the only one that did NOT throw up he just got pale and queesy and stuff.  But we came home he laid down, had some tea and he was like poof all better it was strange.  All the other kids have been ending up out for 2 or 3 days.  So hopefully whatever this weird bug is stays gone.   I called the doctors office to get my results of my ultrasound from my doctor and they said it will be a day or two.  UGH more waiting!!!! The doctor that did my ultrasound at the lab didnt tell me anything...not a word out of him other than when to hold my breathe and stuff like that....usually when its good they say oh look thats all clear.  He said NOTHING to me.  and all I caught a glimpse of was some weird looking blotches since I had to lay on my left side most of the time I couldnt see the screen. So more waiting.    I did a little stitching last night.  Felt good to stitch and relax.  Going to try to do a little tonight too. Ive been working for a few hours now and am just taking a break right now.  Work is good today. :)  and I got the dishes done now I just have to finish cleaning up the kitchen if I can stand up long enough.....

      Tuesday October 7, 2003 While everyone is getting over this nasty cold thing that everyone in the house has had Im sitting here attempting to work but cannot concentrate on anything. I got my bloodwork results last night and they were uneventful, nothing really came up on them, which in a way is good because it means my thyroid and liver are functioning properly, but at the same time its aggrevating because I feel so darn miserable.  I didnt even have the energy to work on my cross stitching yesterday.  The house looks absolutely horrible it is such a mess I havent had the energy to clean anything.  I did a little straightening up this morning but it still has a long way to go to clean. My website needs lots of work this week and I dont know if I will get it done.  Tomorrow will be better, I have an ultrasound scheduled tomorrow morning of my gullbladder and liver and all that stuff to see what the heck is going on there. I actually got out of the house no kids this past weekend.  Unfortunately my brain doesnt function like it used to and I think it was a disappointing evening.  Was supposed to be girl's night out with me and my best friend.  We went to a really great haunted house and then we were headed to the bar, but our fave local spot was crowded due to a band so on my paranoid anxiety type instinct we passed it up to go to a different local spot ... we got there had a drink and the bar decided it was closing early (at midnight!) so we left and went home.  Made for an early evening, surprising my mom (who was watching my boys) and my DH because I was home before him and he wasnt expecting me home until 3 am at the earliest.   When did I get old?

      Yesterday and today have not been the greatest of days.  Everyone in the house was sick yesterday.  Dylan is still stressed out from an incident at school on Thursday. My paycheck still has not come yet... :(  My "monthly visitor friend" decided to come by early this month and is being a miserable bitch too.  Was supposed to have a test done at the hospital today and they tried to give me the wrong test so I left ... now I have to try and schedule one before my surgical consult at a different hospital.    On a brighter note I got a new paid stitch from Dimensions.  It arrived yesterday and I just finished it up today (small piece about 4 inches square) and Dimensions also called and told me I won a drawing for a free matting and framing of a stitched piece :)  But for now I need to get back to work and I want to stitch a little more before bed.

      Well after 2 hours of sleep today was a bit rough.  I hardly got any work done, not that there was much work to do today, it was very off and on today.  I did a little bit of stitching, maybe half an hour, 45 minutes.  One of my paychecks is late coming in the mail and its got me really frustrated.  Ordered the boys halloween costumes, everyone but Dylan so far is covered for halloween.  The other 3 boys have a theme going, Harry Potter of course, whate else! We will have Harry Potter, Hedwig and the Basilisk!!! :-D Should make nice pics this year! and my best friends little girl is going as Hermoine!  Dylan is being the oddball and wants to be something from Yu-Gi-Oh ~lol~ the one track mind of a 6 yr old boy! Im thouroughly annoyed at the procedures I have to go through to get this surgery done and its pretty frustrating to sit here and know that my gullbladder is bad and needs taken out but Im stuck with it for another month because of "scheduling and procedure and insurance"  Well, I better get back to my regular Wednesday chat night and catch up with everyone.   Heading out to Walmart later with my mom, I think Im going to pick up the new Matrix movie.

      Didnt get to write anything yesterday.  Spent the morning calling doctors offices and getting my appointments set up.  I have my CT scan this saturday and my surgical consult at the end of this month.  Ended up falling asleep midafternoon yesterday because I wasnt feeling well.  We rented some movies that evening and I worked on my stitching and that was about it.   Today had been pretty boring. Worked off and on today, only amounted to about $50.  Worked on some website editing and little things with my WIP site.  Went up to the school to have lunch with Dylan (this was a scheduled event) only to find that lunch was over and I had the wrong information and didnt even get to see him. The other boys were pretty lazy today, Luke wasnt feeling well, he seems to have caught the weird fever bug that went around Dylan's classroom last week.   Its really starting to pour down rain here so getting ready to shut down and go do some crafty stuff with the boys before its time to get ready for bed. Then after everyone goes to bed I'll probably try to get another hour or so of work in before I go to stitching :)

      Well today was my surgical consult visit at the doctor....and .... tomorrow morning is my surgery. By lunch tomorrow I will no longer havea gullbladder.  Kind of glad and kind of nervous.  Decided to take a few days offwork and just rest.  My absolutely nutty friend Carrie ordered me MAID SERVICE for Monday so I dont have to clean anything...Carrie your in trouble! LOL ~ so probably no blogging until Im all recovered :)

      Miserable day today, and yesterday, work is hectic, my paycheck is late, and I can hardly stand to sit or walk or do anything.  I laid on the chair most of the day today and just felt blah ~  Tomorrow I have my surgical consult visit, so hopefully I come home with a scheduled date for surgery and get this overwith so I dont feel like such YUCK and hopefully that makes this weird weight gain stop, Ive gained like 60 pounds now and its actually making me more uncomfortable, the doctor said alot of it is from the bloating because of my gullbladder but its just not stopping.... I cant wait to be rid of whatever is the matter with me.

      Havent had time to stitch today but I did stitch a few hours yesterday on A Quiet Moment.  Not been feeling very well and just trying to work or clean up when I can.  Have to remember to call doctors offices tomorrow and see if I can my surgical consult moved up and rescheduled a test, unless the doctor says I can skip it and they can check it later on or during the surgery or something.

      Surgery went really well Friday and here we are only Sunday and I am feeling a lot better already! :) Im still taking my days off work and not doing anything, the kids have been fantastic about helping out , they get things off the shelves for me and keep asking me if I need any help or anything.  Dylan and Luke insist they are my "nurses"  I do have to walk with a pillow on my stomach, and Luke is my officially pillow kid ~ If I put it down or go to another room without he chases me down with it MOMMMY YOUR PILLOW!!!!!! It didnt take Ethan long to realize I couldnt pick him up , so he just pats my leg and says luv you mum,  Jen and the other wonderful ladies at the MMB message boards sent me a great flower arrangement, it arrived yesterday, made me sniffle that they thought of me to send that.  It sitting here on my desk and it definately was the bright spot of my Saturday. :)  Well Im off to take some advil do my morning walk around and make some tea to drink, then Im going to try to do some stitching and try to do more of this do nothing stuff....its hard to do nothing!

      I have been neglecting my poor blog .... along with everything else lately! I've been lazy for awhile here, cut back on work a little because I was tired of having a migraine all the time from staring at the computer.  I was to the point I couldnt even stitch my head hurt so bad and I just didnt want to do anything! After relaxing some I am getting back into the swing of life! Tomorrow is clean out the closets day!!!! We are cleaning out the closets and toy boxes and making a long neglected trip to donate at goodwill.  We just have so much clutter!

      Sometimes I wake up in the morning and I don't want to do anything except go back to bed and pull the covers up and hide from the world. I don't want to be "mom" I don't want to be "wife" I don't want to be "employee" I don't want to be ME I don't want to be anything except someone else.  This was one of those mornings, come to think of it so was yesterday morning.  Sometimes I just can't get myself motivated for the day to come. I have a huge to-do list sitting in front of me with only one things scratched off of it. I'm mentally burnt out on everything anymore.  I have noticed I don't feel quite so much like this when I remember to take all my supplements but I'm pretty bad at remembering to take them all the time. I know it's normal to get this way once in awhile but lately I just want to do nothing...literally nothing. Hopefully once I get this vitamin b deficiency problem under control things will be normal again. As I go along and am taking the supplements I notice myself wanting to do more and sleeping better again.  Today is going to be a long day .... if you happen to catch me slacking and doing nothing please do yell at me and make me go do something.

      So one morning I woke up and I was 25 years old, married with 4 kids and a lot of work to do ~ I was tired, my hair was a mess and I had gained about 90 pounds all while I was asleep.  I guess it's really true that life is what happens while your busy making other plans. Well, I for one am done making other plans. The time has come for life to change. To begin the change we have opted for a new location, We are moving in 2 weeks from Pennsylvania to Virginia...our new apartment is ready and Brian has a new job set and ready to go. Thanks to the world of the internet I've already done a lot of "looking" at all the things I want to do when I get there and "talked" with people that live in the area.  That's the first change.  Second change, if I am going to work at home I need to focus on work for certain periods of time and life the rest of the time. Ultimately this means less time in front of this "BOX" and more time doing other, and valuably more important, things.  I decided to have some updates to my own website and those should be ready soon. I also opted to do some work with a friend starting her own really super cool business ~ not discussing because I'm sure some troller out there will try to steal it.  Not only has my poor blog been neglected but so has my stitching time ~ which as you know helps me stay sane in this crazy zoo house! I've been getting back to that and finished off 2 pieces this week :) (finishes can be seen at  urlLink  my Works in Progress site.  With the move I've decided this is the best time to declutter life and have been getting rid of everything and anything that doesn't get used around here. How on earth did we end up with so much JUNK!!!!! I've taken several bags to goodwill and tossed a lot of just junk in the trash....Im sure the trash guy has loved us the past few weeks.  My brain, my body, my life all needs a makeover at this point as I am practically disgusted with myself over my lack of energy and zeal recently. I'm hoping my blog will serve as a tool to help clear my head of excess "stuff" and keep me focused on what's important and also to just rant about whatever occassionally.

      Kids actually let us sleep in a little bit. As always the to do list is pages long and I don't want to do any of it! LOL But I have to pack -- today's packing list is all breakable stuff that I want Bri to take with him this weekend when he goes to sign the lease. Some more clothes since we will only be here another week. Sometime between packing and working I have to clean up this pigsty.  Bri's hand is all swollen now and he has no idea what he did to it! He missed work yesterday and I don't know if he will make it today and today is supposed to be his last day! Of course he is worried about the money because it will be awhile before he gets a paycheck from the new job after we move since it only pays twice a month.  I've been trying to improve my  urlLink Stitching the Night Away  website and that is slow going. It will have a new look soon, and I am changing around the services and trying to get it going in the right direction again. My original vision for it has been lost in the shuffle lately and I need it to get back to the way it is supposed to be.  So now I'm off to put Noah in a bath and clean up the bathroom a bit then pack a box or two and get to work on making some money!!!! LOL

      Been trying to get as much done as I can since yesterday. Was up until 2:30 am getting my  urlLink Stitching the Night Away   newsletter finished up. We had some great inclusions this month and I wanted it to do them justice.  I actually got some real working done yesterday although not as much as I normally would do, I really have to get myself back on the ball quickly here as I want to start doing more than I normally would after we move. With the new apartment and the new van we will need the extra money to get things settled, as there a lot of things we will be needing.  I also finished a model of one of my own cross stitch patterns - while the pattern isnt uploaded to the website yet for purchasing you can see the  urlLink finished model by clicking here . It's part of a collection of 3 bookmark patterns. The first will be sold as a set and I may add other similar sets in the future. Today I have a lot to do - of course there's a lot to do every day. I need to work for at least a little while, pack Dylan's bags for him to go camping this weekend, pack Luke and Noah's so they can go to Virginia with Bri to get the new apartment lease signed and get a few things into the apartment and set up too, much packing to do today as well as laundry and thousand other things that need to get done. Counting the days until we move! :)

      Thursday just plain stinks ~ why can't today be friday. On top of PMS that is literally making me ill - I've been trying to work, actual work for the first time in several days. I think I've only made about $40 today which if you know me, really stinks.  I've ordered a pizza for the kids for dinner since I just spent two hours on the sofa watching cartoons with them because standing up hurt and made me want to hurl.  I got some pictures of my cousin's wedding day - I didn't get to go because it was no kids, and well I have 4 of those ROFLMAO!  He looks all grown up in his military garb, he is going back to Iraq in about a week.  What a mess this past week has been around here. Even I can't believe this is my life right now.

      It's been a busy day. We got the new van, a 2005 Caravan (with some odd combination of letters after it LOL) brand new just arrived at the dealership this morning.  I'll never understand why people like "new car smell" - it freaking stinks!!!! Going to go febreze it later on! Smells absolutely awful. Still havent figured out this money order situation! That is very frustrating. Brian is going down to sign our new lease this weekend so it's got to get figured out by then. I designed a new cross stitch pattern last night and stitched the model this afternoon while Bri was at the car dealership getting the new van.  Now if I can get some more stuff packed by this weekend, he can pack it up and put it in the new place when he goes this weekend.  I have a ton of stuff to get uploaded to STNA and get things moved around and changed and ready before the newsletter goes out next week! Crazy crazy day! Still a ton to do.

      There is no explanation in the universe as to WHY once one thing goes wrong, 50 other things will follow it!  We went van shopping yesterday only to find out today that they are having a hard time getting our loan approved, despite my husband's good credit score. It's not like we are trying to buy a 50K vehicle here - lol the total cost was something like $21K  and barely a few months ago we were approved for 100K to buy a house - now we can't even get a lousy 21 -- WTF!!!!! We got an approval from Capital One for an auto loan, but the interest rate is so outrageously above the normal interest rate that it makes the payments $100-$150 more a month!!! No wonder Capital One can afford those stupid cheesy commercials they make.  Then our soon to be landlord calls and says she doesn't have our deposit yet - we sent it over a week ago, and of course it's a money order which I hate because it is a major hassle to get it checked out and attempt to get a refund on and sometimes you cannot even get the refund on it! This was so frustrating today because Bri was at work and had to come home, call the landlord find out what was going on, find the receipt and stub for the money order go to the store he purchased it at and then go back to work....all this and we still don't know what the heck is going on! I hate money orders, they are probably worst form of currency ever created.  All I know is I am not answering the phone the rest of the night!!!! On top of it all work sucks, the house is a wreck, Im no where near where I should be on packing - everything is just shit today and my brain just doesn't want to function - can I go back to bed and pretend none of it happened?  Patiently awaiting some good news for the day............

      The things that go through my head lately I think I just need a vacation!!! I don't know why I bother to read message boards and watch the news anymore - these are things that just disgust me with life and people in general. I know they are "real" and working from home and spending as much time in my hobbit hole as I do I need them but ugh --- the world is a disgusting horrid place full of people that care about nothing but themselves.  If I had eaten breakfast already I probably would of lost it just thinking about and reading the things I have read this morning.   What really truly makes me laugh - people think they are anonymous on the internet - ROFLMFAO!!!!! Sorry people there is no real such thing as being anonymous. If you had written it on pen and paper - perhaps you would be, but THIS is the internet! You can be tracked whether you give your real name and email address or not. Even if you can only be tracked to a general location in some cases, if someone wants to find who you are THEY WILL and that is all there is to it. Of course I see no point personally in finding out who people are unless your a psychopathic wacko looking for a victim ----- or vice versa and your trying to find out who the psychopathic wacko that is following you around the internet is.   Well with only 2 weeks left before the big move - I really should be packing boxes not rambling to my blog about how stupid people are and my to do list is still pretty damn long too so I am off to take my vitamins and supplements (HA I remembered) and try to figure out some sense to this mess that is my house right now!

      It always does!  LOL The car got not one but two flat tires today and the van (after spending two days in the shop and costing about $500 already this week) still is not running right. The title is "in the mail" and we can't trade the stupid thing in until the title gets here!!!!  We are moving in 2 weeks --- TWO WEEKS!!!!! So much stuff to do and things are getting complicated now. At least we found a nice apartment to live in :) and Bri will have a career - not just a JOB and will also have lots of opportuinty and great benefits.  Just had to gripe a minute about murphy's law -- back to work

      I can't get myself focused this morning. I woke up with a backache and a migraine. My to do list is a whole notebook page long and my stitching is sitting on top of my desk feeling neglected this morning again. Boxes need packing and it seems no matter how much I do I can't get it all done.  So I browse some message boards before I sink into this pile of work and what is going on in the internet world -- same thing that goes on in the real world, bickering and fighting and just plain stupidity sometimes. Why do I bother? Because right now this stupid little "box" is my social life and my work life -- then I think that is so sad that I am that attached to this little box WTF am I doing?  So It's off to work so I can get at least half of this list done before the season finale of Alias tonight - which hopefully I get to watch in peace and quiet.

      Well yesterday we had the school picnic at Kennywood and though the kids had fun it was a difficult day to say the least. DS#1 got to a point where he wouldnt ride anything and all the rides ended up being at least a 45 min to over an hour wait - it was ridiculous. But we did manage to have some fun at least.   Went to see HP3 last night - it was good, don't want to spoil it for anyone that hasn't seen it yet so I don't want to really say much about it. I was expecting it to be alot longer - I was all prepared for a long 3 hour movie and it was only 2 hours, actually shorter than the preceeding movies, there was a lot of story cut out compared to the book. I realize that they have to do this for the movies but this one was really chopped!!!! Large parts that I was looking forward to seeing on the screen brought to life - totally non-existent in the movie :(  The movers called this morning to say they are coming monday morning :\ EARLY -- yipeee so it's a little hectic right now as we have one less day to finish the packing and sorting and we have got to have this all ready when they get here, anyone want to come over and help? LOL  So in a few more days we will be moved and UNpacking - hooray LOL

      Packing and cleaning and trying to squeeze in time to work and everything has been quite exhausting. Today was DS#1's last day of school, on to second grade next year! Tomorrow is the school picnic at  urlLink Kennywood  and then after that my best friend & I are going to see HP3 - no kids wooooohoooo. Of course we are going at 10 at night so the kids wouldn't make it through the movie anyhow LOL. So tomorrow will be a long day and it's Bri's turn to pack and clean by himself - lol -  I haven't really got much work done lately. I got a  urlLink new ebook  uploaded to  urlLink my site  and ready to sell and listed a few more auctions on ebay  urlLink   Getting involved in a charity stitch over at the  urlLink TWBB   , we are making a quilt for Jessica of  urlLink Six Strand Sweet's  to auction off to help raise money for her little one's medical care. She recently had a raffle and auctioned off a chance to name one of her new colors, all of which went really well. Unfortunately medical bills are insanely ridiculous and every little bit we can raise will help her out.  Well I guess my break is over now and I better get back at cleaning out the boys room and packing things up. Bri and the other 2 boys will be home soon from their trip to VA, the new apartment is all set, lease signed and keys in hand, appointments are set to have the utilities and internet all turned on too. It's going to be a busy busy busy next couple of days.

      Google did it's little thing last night and updated backlinks and page ranks and I'm beginning to think it hates me. My PR has been so up and down this year it's crazy! I checked my backlinks and a large majority of them are message board posts with my signature in them - Which I've never noticed in there before so google must be on crack on again. Hopefully things settle down with it today some. I still have until the next dance to work on my websites.  urlLink Stitching the Night Away  has been a mostly steady PR4 site - it WAS a PR5, briefly, not sure why they took away my precious 5 :(  My other sites - not to be listed right now :P don't really have a PR worth even discussing right now.   Little E and I made it through the night alone -lol- we actually did pretty good just the two of us ;) I got a few little things done, papers sorted, some clothes packed but I'm still no where near where I should be right now.   Only one of my  urlLink ebay auctions  sold this morning - it did well but I thought the other two that I had listed would of done better. I also listed some  urlLink new auctions . Hopefully those will do well, my checkbook is not a pretty place right now with all the moving costs and whatnot.   Maybe I'll find some more things to list while I'm packing today. So here I go again --- trying to pack and clean up

      Today was such a lonely day. Oldest DS won't be home until tomorrow night now. He decided to spend the night at grandma's tonight. Youngest is in bed now sleeping. Just me and my thoughts. Thinking about how people drift away from you. I used to be so close to my cousin and now its her birthday and I can't even call her and tell her happy birthday because I don't know her number, we haven't even talked in almost 3 years now. I saw her at a bridal shower (her brother, my other cousin the one who's wedding I couldn't even go to, just got married this month) and I gave her my number but she lives with her parents and is never there except to sleep so no point calling there. She hasn't called me and I'm moving next week and she doesn't even know I don't think. Several of my friends that were very close, so close we were practically family have drifted away since my family has grown, people assume that because I have 4 kids I don't need or have time for friendship and it just makes me sad sometimes.

      Well Bri and 2 of the boys went to Virginia until the 3rd - Oldest DS is at camp with grandparents - Just me and the youngest allllll alllooone in this quiet house. Of course he is self entertained right now because he can play whatever he wants with no brothers to argue with :p  So it's back to packing for the move again. Alone. I've had no one to help me pack except Bri when he had a chance but with him working up until yesterday there wasn't alot of time for us both to be here and be able to pack one of us was always working. The whole place needs to be packed by the 7th and I don't know how the heck that is going to happen, plus me work, plus do stuff with kids plus sleep LOL  On a lighter less stressful note  urlLink Stitching the Night Away  will have a lot of changes up soon :) I'm actually really excited about that, changing the services available and getting some more people involved and after the move I am going to start a new ad campaign as well I think.  Speaking of moving ---- its next week!!!! I can't believe it! A fresh start on everything.  Getting the internet set up this weekend while Bri is there, cool digital package through the cable company that has digital tv, internet and phone!!!! :) woohooo new toys for me. Getting Merry Maids to come every other week so the house never gets such a mess - I have surrendered to the fact that I can not keep cleaning after 4 kids even with all the help that Bri gives me, heck a lot of the time he gets more done than I do! So for $200 or less a month for them to come every other week is worth my sanity I think - and hopefully it gives me some more work time since I will have less cleaning time.  I'm hoping  urlLink my ebay auctions  for this weekend do really good so that we will have some extra money for School Picnic Day and to go see Harry Potter 3!!!!! I can't wait for that, it's my favorite book of the 5 out already!  I am also thinking of selling on ebay more often - work has been such a mess lately I know my income is going to go down there so I've been looking for new jobs to do.  Need a job done? I'm available -lol- I've applied for a few things recently but this isn't a real busy time of year for alot of places so I don't think I will hear much back. My income will be fine but I'd like some backup since I have been planning to increase my work time when we move so that we can afford to do some more things and get some new things for the new place, and we did just buy a brand new van! So I want to make sure bases are covered and I'd like to actually start some saving up, Bri and I have no savings. With this new diet plan we are going to be on groceries might cost a bit more than usual too.  Well I better get off of blogger and go get some more work done and start packing while Little E is over there munching on his snack.

      Well yesterday I did actually get some things done for a change. I started to pack the good dishes --- then quickly ran out of bubble wrap. So much for trying to save money and buying the packages at the dollar store.  So I worked for a little bit - I think I only did about $20 worth though so not a very productive work session. I got some things listed on  urlLink ebay  yesterday though, hopefully those will sell well. I need to get back into my ebay selling it is quite fun to do :)   I even managed to squeeze some time into stitch!!! I put a few stitches on Day (Emerging Butterfly) by Lanarte, I think it is coming out really nice on the opalescent fabric I chose for it, maybe I can get a progress scan in later on. Hopefully lately tonight I can squeeze in some time to work on my  urlLink Round Robin   Hopefully once we move I get back to normal and have decent time to stitch and get some projects finished!!! I'd like to enter a few in competitions this year if I get them finished in time. Now that Little E is pulling me off my chair - I guess I will blog some more later on.

      Unpacking is such a pain, trying to find a place to put everything is just misery! But we got most of it done yesterday :) Things are falling into place slowly but surely and today we have some things to do, time to go explore the area a little more.  There is so much to do and see and find.  I started working again last night, FINALLY, and got a little bit done. Slowly have to get myself back to full time income again.  I took some time to list a few things on  urlLink ebay  today, moving makes the budget pretty tight around here and there's not alot of breathing room for error in it.  Monday we have to call and register the boys for school, go to the bank and try to get me setup with an account and hopefully get some other little errands done.  I can't wait to get done unpacking so that I can have some time to stitch again!!!!! I joined  urlLink Paw Prints  new  urlLink Silken Bits Club  and I can't wait for the first shipment at the end of this month! With this and my treat of the month at  urlLink Sugar Maple Fabrics   that about spends my stash budget every month for awhile so I'll be counting pennies for a few new patterns I want unless someone out there wants to barter and trade of course ;) But I have plenty to work on right now anyhow. I did get a beautiful fabric from the treat of the month last month that I am just itching to stitch on but I'll have to wait until my budget is a little stretchier so I can buy a cool  urlLink blackwork pattern  ;)  for now it's off to find the other box of towels and unpack those...only a few more boxes left to go!!! then its just rearranging and getting things where I want them to fit at.  Also going to go have a look at some tables, we need a new dining room table. Its actually kind of a good thing that our old one had a cracked leg - it would of never fit in the dining room here. I'm going to look for an oblong pedestal table, and some mismatched chairs, maybe even some fun little cushions.

      Finally moved in, still have some unpacking to do and find a place for everything. But it's good to be moved. Things will get where they belong eventually and I am going to start getting back to work today! I really need to get back to normal again.  ahhh.... summer.

      Well, the updates to  urlLink Stitching the Night Away  are uploaded! Have a look, let me know what you think of the new look! :) I love the new cleaner lines.  urlLink Gerae  did a great job of changing things around without losing the "feel" of the site! I am really happy with the new look, it seems to flow better.  The moving company comes tomorrow morning, early yippee. Kids are getting excited. This is the last night in the house, lots to do in the morning, lots of last phone calls to make to have utilities shut off, final clean up of the house and off we go to Virginia!!!!!  Its so weird seeing our life in boxes, it all fits neatly in one room yet seems like there was so much STUFF but it really isn't. Packing the final boxes of little items now and it's off to a fresh start in our new place. It's kind of exciting after feeling "stuck" for so long. I can't wait to get re-started in a new life. I won't be back online until the 10th or 11th.

      Since hubby went to work today, things feel "normal" again! He was making me nuts because he was so anxious to start his new job at the shipyard. I am really glad he started today. The kids have now asked "where's daddy?" at least 5 or 6 times now today and I when I say he is at work they all pout :( I guess I'm no fun anymore LOL  I got some work done this morning and I'm half way to my goal for the day already! Yippeee! I think I am going to take a stitching break and then do some more. I am determined to finish something this month - I have been lacking in  urlLink happy dances  for 2004!  Hopefully I will get some work and stitching accomplished today so that I can make some additions to my websites :)

      We've lived here nearly a week, pretty much everything is unpacked and 98% of it is put away, there are still some pictures and art to hang up we haven't decided where to hang things yet. It's been a good week eventhough yesterday it was raining insanely and we couldn't really go anywhere.  The post office has of course screwed up our mail forwarding and we haven't gotten anything yet - which is bad because we are waiting for our new van payment information. Tomorrow is Bri's first day at work.  I know Friday - isn't that weird. It's just his orientation day and then he "officially" starts on Monday :)  Silly me got used to having my nights to myself, the kids in bed sleeping and I could watch whatever I wanted on TV or leave it off without anyone complaining, I could get work done I could stitch and just be all by myself and have time for ME - well there goes my ME time right out the dang window - roflol -  But I think I have solved that problem since I can lock myself in the master bedroom and still have a bathroom ;)  Now that we are settled in and unpacked and I've actually been getting back to work - next goal is to lose some of this weight I gained in the last year! It just kept on coming on with no reasoning to it at all, even the doctors were baffled but no one would prescribe a medication to help me, they just kept doing tests and tests and tests and all the tests were "normal" Including having my thyroid tested 3 times. Then I came across a post on a message board that sounded like it repeated my whole scenerio - like they were me down to the last detail and in correspondence with them I learned about a possible Vitamin B deficiency and am now trying to correct that possible problem. Brian says he's going to help me too and he bought this book for a heart healthy diet since he is trying to keep his blood pressure down, it's been very high the past two months, and I also got him on some natural supplements for it and that seemed to get him lowered quite abit after being rather high for awhile. I have so much going in my head these days that its hard to concentrate and I do get distracted easily! I am always trying to work on websites and get link exchanges and I have come to the conclusion that I am just very bad at link exchanges, people ignore my requests and it is just so frustrating to do! I will never understand any of this SEO information no matter how much read it and study it - it's just never going to happen in my brain LOL, I surrender!

      It's been a long slow day with me getting little accomplished. It's finally perking up and it's almost bedtime!  After yesterday being the lousy day it was I wasn't real motivated today :( I'm lucky to have such good friends online. My good friend  urlLink Chrissie  helped me with changing the code on a page of  urlLink Stitching the Night Away . Then the mail came and I got a present!!!!! Woohoo! My friend  urlLink Jen  sent me a Dream Journal and it was the perfect pick me up to my day! Thanks again Jen ;)  It's almost time for our telecommuters chat over at  urlLink MyMommyBiz  and the kids are getting their showers now - I haven't really worked today so I will probably do a little bit later tonight. Figures the day would get good when its almost over - I didn't get any work done, I didn't get any stitching done and I didn't get any rearranging done LOL  Time to put on the coffee and stay up late catching up with my brain ;)

      If I hear Pop goes the weasel one more time my head is going to explode!!!!! I think at least 12 ice cream trucks went by today - it's not the same one every time, different trucks and brands and everything and it is every single day and its driving me bonkers!! It's still ringing in my head I heard it so many times today. Normally when an ice cream truck goes by the kids get all excited and go running for the window - mommy mommy do we have any dollars BUT not anymore, they are actually getting used to it already and it's like no big deal now.  At our old place we were lucky if the ice cream truck came through once a week - and it was a fun exciting thing for the kids, now its just an annoying noise that goes by LOL  I had a bad day today. The ice cream truck annoyed me, work was not good, tv was annoying and youngest DS was just crazy wired today. Wore me out! I think I am just going to go take some advil and go to bed early - and probably have nightmares of  pop goes the weasel !

      What is about Monday that just plain stinks? I don't have to get dressed and go to a job outside of my home anymore and I still despise Monday mornings. I can work with messy hair and PJ's and sit here with my tea - but it still just stinks, even over the summer when there's no school and we can sleep in a bit.  Today is a get organized day, I did some working this morning and now Im trying to get everything cleaned and organized. Still nothing hanging on the walls, but I think I know where I want to put a few things so I might do that today. I lost my little picture level though - so I might just wait until after a trip to walmart or something.  It's been good to get back to working like normal again :) I added up how much I did this past week and was actually pleased with the number I got for a change!  For right now I want to go throw something in the crockpot for dinner and a cake in the oven so we can have a nice dinner when Brian gets home to celebrate the new job and school.  Finally feel like we are in the right place at the right time doing the right things.

      July is nearly here and July is a busy month for me - I am freaked out totally!  My mom and stepdad are coming to visit this weekend over the long holiday weekend. My best friend's daughter turns 7 this week also, I already ordered her present, thank goodness I remembered to at least get that done! Bri's birthday is this month - the big  30  for him this year! No clue what to get him LOL So many things are going on right now and I am just trying really hard to keep up with them all! Getting the kids ready for school and getting comfortable in this new place, getting things in the right places, trying to work so that I can get ahead again. I've been looking at some new opportunities as well and I have made some changes to my websites.  urlLink Stitching the Night Away  has had a lot of changed in the last two weeks - hopefully I have made the site better and more efficient.  For some reason today Brian and I both woke up all stuffy headed and puffy and itchy and can't breathe - I'm off to take some tylenol sinus and work on my cross stitching for awhile because the computer is looking like a big blur!

      Yesterday I just felt "blah" - I hate feeling that way. I didn't get any work done - I really didn't get much of anything done. Went to the inlaws for dinner last night, that was probably the most productive part of my day LOL I wrote myself a daily checklist so I can remember to take my vitamins and supplements. Taking the vitamin B/zinc (you need zinc to absorb vitamin B properly) really helps with those "blah" days and I have been forgetting to take it every day, twice a day like I should be. Losing weight is a neverending battle and it is not going well to say the least - no matter what I do or what I eat I cannot lose weight and its really been very frustrating. Brian and I were talking about picking 3 days a week to go and walk the nature trails with the kids for a bit of extra excercise for everyone. I think we will start that this week (if it stops raining!) Today it's back to work, already started for the day and I'm taking a quick blog break here then back to it again.  Also have a few things that need to get put away that kind of just got tossed in the "don't know what to do with this pile" when we unpacked and work on shopping lists of things we need both grocery and household in general.  I've been trying to squeeze in some stitching time every day again like I used to. Yesterday and the day before I didn't really get to but most of the week I fit it in.  Today is a rainy dreary day and it looks like it's going to be like this most of the week - blah! No trips to the playground this week.  Better get my tooshie back to work....

      Why is that so true? I will never get to where I want to be at this rate. No matter how much of anything I do it is just never done. I work on my websites yet they are never finished. I stitch and stitch and stitch yet there is still so much to stitch. I work and work and work and yet my bank account still needs a bigger paycheck in it.  I just made out to-do-list for tomorrow, I kept it short with minimal goals so that I know I can actually get them done. I just finally got done with today's to-do list and it is now past my bedtime. I have so many things to do for this week still, and tomorrow is Thursday already!!! It will just never all get done. I have so many ideas that I want to persue business wise and not enough time or space to do them all. Someone told me the other day that I should just sell my ideas. With the growing popularity of ebooks and information packages etc I have actually considered this as an option but they are my ideas and I am not ready to share them with the world just yet ;)  For now I must finish one last thing on my to-do-list and then finally get to bed! Good night moon ;)

      The long weekend is over and everyone is back to work! WooHoooo!  It was kind of a blah weekend for 4th of July this year, we had a lot of rain and yuck weather. We did still get to see fireworks but it barely stopped raining in time for them.  Bri took the oldest two boys to see Spiderman-2 at the theatre yesterday and ended up having to come home early (he should of listened to me but nooooooooooo - why would anyone listen to me), and apparently a lot of other parents left with their kids as well. The second movie is far far far more graphic than the first, the first wasn't really scary for kids because there was no graphic squirting gross violence in it - with the exception of that last part where the Green Goblin gets killed - the second movie is very graphic with a more in depth story line around Doc Ock and the kids totally understood what was going on and it's just not a pretty thing. I knew all this before hand because I saw in depth previews and making ofs and interviews with the cast blah blah blah - but no one believed me that this one might scare the kiddos ;) Anyhow, I did get a lot of  urlLink stitching  done this long holiday weekend and finished up a few small things. I added some of the pics already - I still have a few more to add. I also updated pics of some of my WIP's to how they currently look, some of the pics were getting old in there, why didn't someone yell at me!  I've been working alot of designeing also. I have decided I am going to be a big brave girl and finish up some of the models for a few things I have been working on and submit some of them to cross stitch magazines. I think it will be a good way to get my name out there and I am interested in furthering a career in that field. I have also been doing some research on different forms of publishing and considering getting some different design software.  There is just so much information out there now a days for stitchers and designers alike that it is amazing :)  Well, I better get off the blogger for awhile and go do some things while work is slow - have a grateful day :)

When things slow down I'll pop back in to update this blog.  happy blog trails everybody ;)
