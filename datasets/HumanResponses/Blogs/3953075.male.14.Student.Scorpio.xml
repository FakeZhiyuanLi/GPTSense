      Hey Darien, It sounds so funny the way u said that. Oh, and i have some good/bad news. I dont know whether this is good or bad news, so here goes... I am pregnant. Ok, joking, im not, but i guess u guessed i am not, but yes, there is some good/bad news. In 6 weeks (3 September) i am going to Bali. I am not joking this time. I am gonna be closer to u!!! lol but any way i dont know if i can do chat or the net there or wateva, but i will send u a post card, i will need a forwarding address from u so i know where to send it. and i think this is great we can blog away to each other. bloggyness...lol cya, Renée :-* PS, im guessing u got the e-mail from malcolm aswell, at least now we know he is still ALIVE!!!

      Dear Darien, Today, i didnt go to skool. I have had a head ache every since i went to skool on monday. it was really bad this morning so i had a panadol (even though they dont normally work 4 me) and went back to bed. when i got up, it was 12noon. i watched last nights tape of  The O.C. and Rove Live. I cant wait for the weekend. My head ache is back again and its really starting to piss me off. is the address you gave me going to be a permenent one or not? i need to know for when i am in Bali. cya later Renée
