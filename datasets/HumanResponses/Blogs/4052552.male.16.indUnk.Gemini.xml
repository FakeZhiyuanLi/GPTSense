        What's up people? Nothing for me. Today has been ... sort of eventful. I guess. Got up this morning and did nothing, then ran to Fort Dodge, Iowa to get my haircut and look for cell phone covers for my phone. I didn't have luck, so I guess i'll just have the plain old default one for awhile. Got home and picked up my pictures from Pamida from NYE. They turned out pretty good. If you wanna see em, just go to  urlLink http://public.fotki.com/rosco2007/  and have fun.          Well that's all I can think of to write about today, I'll catch ya later.          Rosco.

        Life sucks. I thought breaking up with Tara would affect her more than it would affect me. But, I'm wrong. As always. I'm not upset that I broke up with her. I'm not regretting it. I'm just a little confused. She just moved on soo quickly. So quickly that if it was a movie the dialogue would look something like:          Me: I don't think we should be together.          Tara: But ... but ... I love you.          Me: Goodbye.          -5 Days Later-          Tara: Hey look, there's Arik! I love Arik so much.          Somebody: What about Ross?          Tara: Ross who?          So yeah. Arik still thinks Tara loves me, which I doubt. Arik thinks me and Staci are gonna hook up and fall in love. I doubt it. We're just gonna stay good friends, but have a little more fun. That's not wrong, is it? Eh, I don't care.           Tara thinks me and her will be great friends. Which I doubt. I would consider it if she hadn't run off with one of my ... i dunno if I can say it but ... best (?) friends. But hey, she'd feel the same way if I ran off with ... hmm ... Tracy, or Tori. Who I barely know so I wouldn't do that. I've come to the conclusion that life sucks. Shit will happen, and I'm gonna let it. Arik and Tara can have all their fun and shit, and I'll just sit back and watch the drama unfold. It's bound to happen. And i'm not the only one that thinks so.          Adios.          Rosco.

        Hey My Fellow Losers:       &nbsp;   It's me again and I have exciting news. Heh. Right. No. I was actually just bored and figured I'd write something in this thing so here I am. I just got back from an interview at Pamida, it was horrible, I suck at those things. Oh well, I have another interview at Fareway at 4 this afternoon, hopefully I'll have a job by next week. Woo.        &nbsp;   Damn, I can't think of anything to write in this bloody thing so i'm just gonna ramble. It seems me and Tara and done, forever. Oh, here's a shocker, she found someone new before me. That really surprised me, I thought I'd have a new girlfriend before she'd have a new boyfriend. Oh well, I guess i'll just be single for awhile. That's okay, I -love- being single. *rolls eyes* I have a few people on my mind but I know they'll say no, but w/e. :-( So if there's anyone out there that's single, CALL ME! or email me, whatever.       &nbsp;   I'll catch all you losers later.        &nbsp;   -Rosco.

        Okay, so here I am, I have a new blog now and I havent updated the other one since May so I guess this is long overdue. For you people that don't know who I am, my name is Ross, but people call me Rosco (well atleast the cool people like Christine and Ashley). I'm 16 years old and I live in Humboldt, Iowa and I don't have a life. Oh, and I'm single...so if there's anyone out there that needs a hot boyfriend...keep looking, but whoever wants an average boyfriend, I'm your man!       &nbsp;   Well this past week was prolly one of the best weeks I've had, or will have. It was the United Church of Christ National Youth Event on the campus if the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, and it was a lot of fun. On Tuesday, we all met at Pilgrim Heights in Tama where we got to know eachother and play games and stuff. On Wednesday we loaded two charter buses and left for Indianapolous, Indiana where we stayed the night and messed around at a Great Times place.        &nbsp;   On Thursday we loaded the buses again and set out for Knoxville, at around 5:00 or so, I don't remember when. We were givin the wrong information so we sat around for an hour in front of the wrong dorms. So when we went to eat, they were done serving and we were late to the opening worship and procession of banners, so UT paid for 42 pizzas from Domino's since we didnt get to eat.        &nbsp;   On Friday we had our first workshops and stuff. I hung out with Arik, Staci, and Hannah mostly that day. Then after our first workship we had freetime/sack lunch until 2 then we had another workshop. Then we had free time from 4 to 7 p.m.,&nbsp;me Arik,&nbsp;Hannah, and Staci went to the pool, the girls tanned and me and arik sat in an air conditioned&nbsp;building and watched hot&nbsp;girls.&nbsp;Then we had worship and Christine and Ashley sat by me and we quickly became good friends.       &nbsp;   On Saturday we had opening bible study and stuff, most messed around with Ashley, Christine, and Nate, lol. Then I went to a workshop with Ashley and Christine, it was fun... Then we had lunch again, we just hung out in the dorms and ate pizza and listened to music. That's when Ashley and Christine crimped Jon's hair, it was hilarious, then they made him put on a skirt and a tube top, omg it was great. We didnt have a workshop that afternoon so Ashley, Christine, Nate and I hung for awhile then at the dorms more people joined us and they played cards. Worship again, Ashley and Christine got in trouble for talking, lol, and then there was a Sheltered Reality concert outside our dorms, they're awesome...still.       &nbsp;   Sunday, was the same as every other day, hung out with mostly Chirstine and Ashley (since I'm a big ladies man) and had workshops and shit. Then we had closing worship and we got yelled at by a lady behind us for being too loud and shit, its all good. Then we had closing vespers, the senior's last service, a lot of people cried, but I didnt, i hate crying. Then we loaded the bus and got on the road for home at around 12:45 or 1. Me and Ashley sat together, she slept but i couldnt get to sleep since she was laying on top of me the entire time, lol. But thats okay ;-). After the first&nbsp;stop, I finally got some sleep. At a quarter to 5 we arrived back at Pilgrim Heights, we already dropped people off at I-80 truck stop, and Coralville. I didn't want to go home because I knew I prolly wouldnt see all the cool people I met for a long time...but oh well, have to get back to my worthless boring life sometime.       &nbsp;   Well that's about it...       &nbsp;   -Rosco.        &nbsp;     &nbsp;

        Hey people, what's up? Yesterday was my first day working at Fareway. It went alright, I got the hang of everything already, which is good...right? I got there I had more paperwork to fill out, had to watch a couple movies on safety and shit. Then he took me up front and showed me how to sack groceries, like to put all the frozen shit together, and dont put the bread on the bottom, common sense really. Then he showed me how to properly take the groceries out to the people's cars... Yeah it was ... really exciting. I worked from 10 till 2 and made like...$24 whoo...money, i don't get paid till next Friday tho so that sucks.          Anyways...last night my dad finally decided to tell me that we're going to the Nickelback and Puddle of Mudd concert on Thursday at the Iowa State Fair. So I think me and my parents are going down early to like ... do stuff at the fair or something. And I was just talking to Staci and I guess she wants to go so if she can get there and if my parents dont care we're gonna go together and that'd be awesome. I'd kinda rather go to the concert with Staci than my dad, lol.           So yeah...I have to work tomorrow again...meh...I hope I don't have to follow the manager around again, that's embarrassing...Anyways, I'm bored so I think I'm gonna let you get back to your boring lives...           Adios.      Rosco.

        Hey people, it's me and I've returned from a long weekend at Pilgrim Heights. Lemme fill ya in...          Okay well, Friday morning me and my mom left Humboldt at 6:30a and we headed for Madrid because we had to take my grandma to Mercy West in Des Moines for her knee surgery. We eventually got to Mercy at around 9:15a or so, i dunno. They took her in and stuff. Me, my aunt and my mother sat and watched TV in the waiting room for awhile and then we went out to eat to Cheddar's and I had a huge bacon cheeseburger, omg, the best. Anyhoo...we went back to the hospital and went into the recovery room and talked to gma for awhile and stuff. She was sick from the anesthesia so we had to wait until 2:30p or so before we could take her back to Madrid.          So we got back to Madrid around 3 or so and we sat around for an hour and me and the mother left for Tama. We got there at around 6:30p or so and we unloaded all our stuff into the lodge and headed to Montour to eat at Rube's Steakhouse. Yum...the 16 oz. ribeye is really good. Anyhoo...after that we headed back to the camp and we sat around for awhile and talked and stuff.          The next morning we had breakfast and then the official day to do nothing began. All the adults sat around and talked and shit while me and a couple other kids screwed around by the lake, mostly trying to catch minnows and shit. That night we had a camp fire and the adults sang songs and crap, the little kids had s'mores and I did nothing. Then me, Marcus and Andrew played foosball and ping-pong for a while and stuff.          This morning we had breakfast, blah blah blah and then we had church. After church me and Andrew went out on the lake in a boat and tried catching turtles unsuccessfully. After lunch we went back out for a couple hours and caught a total of 4 painted turtles, it was pretty sweet. We let em go, of course, and then we all left and here I am filling in all you un-interested people. Next year it doesn't look like Marcus and Andrew are gonna get to go so I'm hoping I'll be able to bring Staci maybe since she told me she really wants to go sometime. *shrug*          Anyhoo...tomorrow I start training at Fareway. Ugh. That's gonna suck...but atleast it wont be that busy. ... Yeah ... I can't think of anything to write so I'm gonna let you go. I'll catch ya later.           Adios.      Rosco.

        WHOOO!!!! I just got back from Fareway and they fucking hired me!!! In your face!! This morning Todd from Fareway called me and asked me if I could come and talk to him today and I did and he hired me. But, eh, he made me run up to the courthouse so the Iowa Workforce or w/e could fill out paperwork and shit, then I had to run it back to Todd then he had to fill something out, I had to take it back to the courthouse they had to make copies and shit and then I had to run some more stuff to Todd. Now he has to send all the paperwork to the headquarters in Boone and stuff and he should hear from them by Friday and stuff. Then I have to get trained and stuff...fun stuff.          Anyhoo...last night I decided to talk to Tara. Not about the shit I've done and stuff, but about her and Jon. Her and Jon, Kait's bf, hung out and stuff on Friday night. Supposedly because he doesn't know anybody in Hartley except Tara. Then on Saturday they went to a ... dance. Yeah, that kinda pissed Kait off so last night I decided I would try to get juicy details but I couldn't. She just told me the same stuff that she told Kait. Then we moved on to other stuff...blah blah blah. Then I got off and Staci called me and she was talkin to me about what her and Tara were talking about. They hate eachother again, surprise surprise. I don't care anymore, I'm not in the middle of it anymore, Arik's the bitch now. :-p          So yeah anyways, I'll catch y'all later.           Adios.      Rosco.

        Well I'm bored and have nothing to do so I guess it's rambling time.          Well, first off, Tara deleted her blog so now I don't have to read sappy love notes or whatever anymore. But her last entry was hilarious. She was sayin how there's 4 people that her mom is pissed off at and stuff and that if we even think of coming close to Hartley, we won't hear the end of it from her mother or whatever. Heh. Whoo..another person that hates me...well prolly a whole 'nother -family- that hates me. I'm always the bad guy. *shrug* I don't care, I can go to Hartley if I damn well please, its not like I'm gonna be anywhere near them when I am up there.          Well this morning I had to get up early and work at a car wash at my church to raise money for our mission trip to Hawaii next summer. It was a lot of work and it sucked, mostly the part where I got soked from a hose. Eh. Oh well, it cooled me off. I think we raised like over $400, that's not bad, not bad at all. After that I went out to eat at Chang's with Kait and her family since my family had to go to Omaha to move Jen into her apartment. I was thinkin about goin with them to Omaha but I was thinkin about goin up to Hartley to see Ashley but I havent talked to her in over a week so with my luck she'd be on vacation when I got up there so it wouldn't of been worth it.          Anyways, I've been bored all afternoon with nothing to do...stopped watching the Cubs game because they were losing but now they're ahead so I guess I might go watch the rest of the game. I'll prolly get bored again and I'll end up in front of the computer. So yeah...           Adios.      Rosco.

        Hello people,          I'd first like to address a couple people in my life who I've had hard feelings towards for the past week or so. Tara and Arik. Last night I got into Tara's email account and did some stuff which I regret. I deleted all of her email's she's saved from me, Arik, whoever. I changed her password and her secret question and answer. I also gave Staci the password and she emailed Arik (using Tara's email) and told him some stuff...idk...          Then this morning I got into Tara's AIM account (it was way too easy) I, personally, didn't do anything except sign in once or twice and I didn't talk to a soul using her SN. However, I told Staci her password once again and she did talk to somebody. She pretended she was Tara's mom and talked to Arik. I guess that pissed off Arik and Tara...          I'd like to apologize to Tara for hacking her email and AIM, I dunno why I did it, maybe as revenge for hurting me, idk. I'd also like to apologize for Staci, sometimes she's a little -too- evil and...yeah.          Anyways...I talked to Arik earlier, clearified that it wasnt me he was talking to when he thought he was talking to Tara's mother. I guess our friendship is a -little- better. It's never gonna be like it used to, but it may get better.          Oh yeah, one more thing. Me and Kait are planning on going to Hartley this weekend, Kait wants to see Jon and (dunno why) help him move and stuff. So i figured I could go with her, maybe see Ashley, if I'm lucky. Idk, the parentals will be in Omaha moving Jenny so I wont have anything better to do all day Saturday.          Welp, I better go.           Adios.      Rosco.

        Yes, life still sucks.   My depression is getting a little better since I've talked to Tracy (Tara's friend) about stuff and she was a lot of help. But I guess i'm starting to get sick. Not physically sick. Just sick of some stuff. Mostly Arik and Tara. It seems that they -think- they are in love but face the facts, people. They're 15 years old. Love doesnt exist when you're 15. I've learned from that mistake. I just hope this time, they will too.          I'm also sick of the fact that they have the nerve to say that Staci and I are jealous. Jealous of what? Oh, because they're in love. Uhh...No. We're not saying all this stuff like that they're not gonna last because we're jealous. We're saying it because it's true. People said the same stuff about me and Tara. And they were right. I wish I would've listened earlier.           I can't believe I'm saying this but...I can't wait till school starts. Something to take my mind of all this shit that's going on in my life. Maybe once school starts I can find a -real- girlfriend. Not a girlfriend that's gonna be depressed 24/7 and maybe one thats not gonna run off with my best friend. I can only hope. It'd be nice to have somebody that's a little closer to home. That long distance thing was a mistake. I'm not gonna try that ever again, unless I find a -perfect- girl that I can trust, one that won't come crying to me every 15 minutes because they're depressed. Yeah, I know, far fetched dream, right? Oh well. Maybe some people were meant to be alone.          Adios.      Rosco.
