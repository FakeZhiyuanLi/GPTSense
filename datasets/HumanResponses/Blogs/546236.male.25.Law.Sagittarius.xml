       ONE THE BEST FIRST SENTENCES EVER . This story about a recent  urlLink Jane Goodall talk  is funny for a myriad of reasons.  Jane Goodall was reminding the young people that African chimpanzees are endangered by corrupt policies when the power went out. That's one funny, here's another.  “If everybody acts the way they know will be the best for society and for the environment every day, can you imagine the difference that would make?” Goodall asked the crowd of elementary, middle and high school students Wednesday at Pacific University. Isn't that precisely how people HAVE acted for the past few thousand years? Isn't the problem when those ideas differ? To continue:  Wednesday was the third time Rachael has met Goodall. While the eighth-grader was as excited and nervous as the first time, it didn’t show as she adroitly explained to Goodall the progress of the  school’s flourishing courtyard of natural vegetation .  Read: Weeds. As the environmentalist floated around the room — followed by throngs of children and teachers flashing cameras — six Chapman Hill Elementary students practiced what they would tell her. Goodall as Jesus/Pied Piper? As Goodall approached, the children carefully gathered around her. Goodall smiled down on them and spoke so softly in the noisy gym that only the children could hear her. She smiled upon them and laid her hands on the sick, and they rose and gave thanks. Goodall is also one of nine “messengers for peace” recognized by the United Nations.  " The  urlLink Nine  have left Minas Morgul. They travel in search of The One Ring. They are tireless – they will never stop searching until they find it...   Her current vision is to have people around the world make large “peace doves” to fly on World Peace Day, Sept. 21. Eh, that's already been tried...by  urlLink Red Bull

"I'm a square," Dean declared, after professing his metrosexuality to a Boulder breakfast audience with an anecdote about being called handsome by a gay man. "I like (rapper) Wyclef Jean and everybody thinks I'm very hip, but I am really a square, as my kids will tell you. I don't even get to watch television. I've heard the term (metrosexual), but I don't know what it means." In other news, National Coming Out Day was held on campus a few weeks ago...  ...I stayed in.

       SHEILA O'MALLEY FEELS SORRY FOR KURT COBAIN'S DAUGHTER  Sheila over at  urlLink Redheaded Ramblings  has expressed concern for lil Frances Bean and notes that her mother  urlLink might be a loon.  Shelia suggests that the child should stay with Cobain's mom.   My thoughts are if you ever saw that MTV special "Fanatic" where a really huge Cobain fan visits Kurt's hometown and talks to Cobain's mother, among other people (including Kurt's crack-addict first love), might not be such an easy choice.  Who do you want the kid to be with? The lady that turned him into a whiny self-absorbed 'tard or the lady that made him kill himself.  I say give the child to the Donny Osmond. Osmonds never hurt nobody.

       WE'RE FAT AND OLD.  You know you're in a pretty well-off society when  urlLink obesity is the top health problem  in the country. I suppose on the one hand this is a bad thing, but you also need to keep in mind that while we're obese,  urlLink we're also living a really really long time .  Isn't this the best of both worlds? Wasn't the whole idea behind exercise and eating right the prevention of premature death? How cool is it that you don't have to live a  urlLink Spartan lifestyle  of eating pork, blood, salt and vinegar to still last a good long while on the terra firma.  Yes I know, I like working out too, I was once quite adept at the "Long Island Workout" (biceps, triceps, chest, and shoulders)--but damn it, I don't like it THAT much. Mint Chip Ice Cream is good too. And if I can have slightly more of the latter and slightly less of the former without dying at 55, awesome.

       LYNCH SNUBS RESCUER?   urlLink That's the report from the Telegraph.  Sounds a little fishy, but here's an excerpt:  Miss Lynch, portrayed as a heroine of our times for her courage while a prisoner of war, was too busy to receive the visitor, her family's lawyer said. Her saviour, Mohammed al-Rehaief, was outwardly understanding of her failure to appear during his trip. "I know she had a very difficult time in Iraq and she takes rest," he said.  However, Mr al-Rehaief, who has been granted asylum in the United States for fear of revenge attacks in Iraq, was reported to be disappointed by her failure to meet him on his visit to Palestine, West Virginia.  The Lynchs' lawyer, Stephen Goodwin, denied that rivalry between the 20-year-old former soldier and her Iraqi benefactor over competing media projects was to blame for her absence. "Absolutely not," he said.  There is an amusing aspect to the story though: But the misunderstandings were not confined to Miss Lynch's refusal to attend any of the ceremonies. Local people laid on an impressive spread at a reception to greet the al-Rehaiefs, only to discover that the family was fasting for Ramadan.  Even if the guests had been hungry they would have been unlikely, as Muslims, to tuck into the ham sandwiches on offer.  UPDATE : Lynch, through a spokesman,  urlLink here  says: "Jessica wants to meet with Mohammed, but she wants that meeting to be private, without camera or reporters present.   Jessica is confident her fellow West Virginians will understand her want for privacy and her need for time.   Jessica has a desire to meet everyone who played a role in her rescue and looks forward to doing so in due time, with an absence of fanfare."  Should I devote this entire blog to covering this story so that could be my niche? Like some blogs are econ related, others are all about corp law, etc etc? I could be all Lynch, all the time!  Or not.

       AIN'T NO PARTY LIKE A COMMUNIST PARTY.   What if you threw a  urlLink Communist party , and nobody came?   It was billed as a gathering of socialism's stars, but no-shows and last-minute cancelations put a damper on the 22nd Socialist International Congress.   Brazil, with its first elected leftist government, seemed an attractive venue for a socialist these days. Not to be deterred, the fellow travelers march on, despite the absence of such luminaries as Yasser Arafat and Gerhard Schroeder.  "Some of the delegates here today will be the leaders of their countries tomorrow," he said.   Heaven help us.

       WINDOWS BFD.   urlLink Microsoft gives an early look at next Windows .  The next version of the ubiquitous PC software will come with a new "sidebar" running down one side of the screen. The sidebar, which stays visible while the PC user works in an application, can show things like a "buddy list" of contacts, display a slide show of photographs or receive other types of media.  At the heart of the next Windows will be a new format for storing data that Microsoft has worked on intermittently for more than a decade. Rather than each software application saving information in a different format, a new standardised file system known as WinFS will create a single, unified system.  That means users will be able to find any information on their own PCs or across their corporate networks with a single search, then collate different types of data, whether in the form of text documents, spread sheets, video or audio recordings, Microsoft executives said.  Other key technologies in Longhorn will include a more powerful 3D graphics capability known as Avalon, which has been adapted from high-performance computer game systems, and a communications technology called Indigo, which will let users integrate information from other sources with data held on their desktops.  Some of the features do sound kind of cool, but damn it, y'all better prove to me its worth it. (granted, XP might be a dinosaur by 2006--the new OS' expected ship date)  Wanna know the best part? The name of this new OS is....   Longhorn.   *snicker*

       WE'RE A FAST MOVIN' TRAIN BABY--CLIMB ABORD .  urlLink College students have become more conservative than the general population, according to a new poll  According to a poll released this week by Harvard University's Institute of Politics, college students generally support President Bush, and they lean slightly Republican in political persuasion -- a contrast to the commonly held stereotype of radical campus liberals.  But while 46 percent of students agree that the country is on the right track, they remain politically conflicted. In the past year, their trust in the president declined as concerns grew about Iraq. They aren't oblivious to the world around them, the poll suggests; instead, they are worried about the state of the economy and about finding jobs. And today's students aren't political "slackers"; they say they are poised to become active in the 2004 election -- if asked.  "Most campaigns are geared toward voters with an immediate economic stake in the election," said Dan Glickman, director of Harvard University's Institute of Politics and a former U.S. agriculture secretary. "Young people don't have a voting track record, and the regular way of campaigning often misses this group."  More than two-thirds of the students surveyed are registered to vote -- and eight in 10 said they would vote in 2004. As a whole, 18- to 24-year-olds are less than half as likely to vote as college students. Perhaps surprisingly, 31 percent of college students identify themselves as Republicans, while 27 percent call themselves Democrats and 38 percent independent or unaffiliated.  I retain the right to call this blog post the Worst Titled Post EVER.

       NY TIMES: A Cultural Scorecard Says West Is Ahead   urlLink So sayeth Charles Murray :  Published on Oct. 21 by HarperCollins and accompanied by a publicity release optimistically anointing it "his most ambitious and controversial work yet," "Human Accomplishment: The Pursuit of Excellence in the Arts and Sciences, 800 B.C. to 1950" is well timed to stir debate. At a moment of considerable East-West tension, when the phrase "clash of civilizations" has rarely had greater currency, Mr. Murray has issued what he says is a mathematically precise global assessment of human achievement, a "résumé" of the species in which Europeans like Shakespeare, Beethoven and Einstein predominate and in which Christianity stands out as a crucial spur to excellence. Equally provocative, he maintains that the rate of Western accomplishment is currently in decline.   "As I write, it appears Europe's run is over," he asserts. "In another few hundred years, books will probably be exploring the reasons why some completely different part of the world became the locus of great human accomplishment. Now is a good time to stand back in admiration. What the human species is today it owes in astonishing degree to what was accomplished in just half a dozen centuries by the peoples of one small portion of the northwestern Eurasian land mass."  Granted, the article notes that Murrary is arguably using a questionable statistical model. But the article/review is interesting nonetheless and is exactly the same debate I've been having over email for the past few days with some classmates (guess which side I'm on). Why, he wondered, when he factored in population growth, did the achievement rate in Europe appear to plummet beginning in the mid-19th century, a period when peace, prosperity, cities and political freedom were steadily increasing? In the sciences, he decided, the decline was largely benign, reflecting the fact that in many fields the most important breakthroughs have already been made. But for the arts his diagnosis was grim: a collapse of social values and the advent of nihilism.   In a word, what modern Europe lost was Christianity. While other major religions, like Buddhism and Daoism preached humility, acceptance and passivity, Mr. Murray writes, Christianity fostered intellectual independence and drive. In his account it was Thomas Aquinas who "grafted a humanistic strain onto Christianity," by arguing that "human intelligence is a gift from God, and that to apply human intelligence to understanding the world is not an affront to God but is pleasing to him." And where post-Aquinas Christianity thrived — in Europe between 1400 and the Enlightenment — so, too, according to Mr. Murray, did human excellence.   Oh just read it all darn it. I've got Evidence reading to do.

       CHOMSKY WAS ALWAYS PICKED LAST IN KICKBALL . That is my conclusion after reading this excerpt from  urlLink  Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media    Take, say, sports -- that's another crucial example of the indoctrination system, in my view. For one thing because it -- you know, it offers people something to pay attention to that's of no importance. [audience laughs] That keeps them from worrying about -- [applause] keeps them from worrying about things that matter to their lives that they might have some idea of doing something about. And in fact it's striking to see the intelligence that's used by ordinary people in [discussions of] sports [as opposed to political and social issues]. I mean, you listen to radio stations where people call in -- they have the most exotic information [more laughter] and understanding about all kind of arcane issues. And the press undoubtedly does a lot with this.   You know, I remember in high school, already I was pretty old. I suddenly asked myself at one point, why do I care if my high school team wins the football game? [laugbter] I mean, I don't know anybody on the team, you know? [audience roars] I mean, they have nothing to do with me, I mean, why I am cheering for my team? It doesn't mean any -- it doesn't make sense. But the point is, it does make sense: it's a way of building up irrational attitudes of submission to authority, and group cohesion behind leadership elements -- in fact, it's training in irrational jingoism. That's also a feature of competitive sports. I think if you look closely at these things, I think, typically, they do have functions, and that's why energy is devoted to supporting them and creating a basis for them and advertisers are willing to pay for them and so on.   There's something scary about someone that finds conspiracy and nefarious plots in EVERYTHING--especially Little League.

       SF MAYOR WILLIE BROWN GETS OUTPLAYED . From the  urlLink SF Chronicle :  In a move some called gutsy and others childish, San Francisco Supervisor Chris Daly used his powers as acting mayor Wednesday to appoint two people to the powerful Public Utilities Commission while Mayor Willie Brown was traveling in Tibet.   It was a premeditated stroke of opportunism that observers said was without parallel in modern political times at City Hall and caught the Brown administration and Daly's Board of Supervisor colleagues by surprise.   Unless Brown can muster eight votes on the 11-member board to overturn Daly's act, the appointments are likely to stand, city lawyers said, and would go down as audacious coup against one of the great political gamesmen in California history.  ... A mere 18 minutes after Daly swore his two appointees into their new posts, one of Brown's two political guns showed up to his supervisor's office and announced that effective immediately, Daly was no longer acting mayor.   A poll next to the article has 9% of the people saying "That'll teach Willie to go to Tibet." hehe

       FUN MOMENTS IN PULITZER PRIZE HISTORY.  Can you guess which Pulitzer Prize winning book contained the following? "That is, in mental ability New Guineans are probably genetically superior to Westerners, and they surely are superior in escaping the devastating developmental disadvantages under which most children in industrialized societies now grow up.  Certainly there is no hint at all of any intellectual  dis advantage of New Guineans that could serve to answer Yali's question.  ... Thus, the usual racist assumption has to be turned on its head.  Why is it that Europeans, despite their likely genetic disadvantage, ended up with much more of the cargo?  Why did New Guineans wind up technologically primitive, despite what I believe to be their superior intelligence?" The answer is:   urlLink     So we've replaced one racist notion of genetic superiority with another. Yay.   So why am I mentioning a 4 year old book? Well, because that passage stuck out in my mind and it came up recently in a debate and the book has always bugged me.

       SEIZE THIS!  To anyone who has had the displeasure of actually  reading  a United Nations resolution, this Eliot Cohen piece on  urlLink OpinionJournal  should make you either chuckle or sigh at what the UN has become (if it were ever anything else):  As a matter of civic education, everyone should have to read a U.N. Security Council resolution. Take number 1511 on Iraq, and begin with the obligatory last sentence "DECIDES to remain seized of the matter." The line is both arresting and baffling, and conjures an image of scores of goggle-eyed diplomats caught in a cataleptic fit as a result of wrestling with a knotty foreign policy problem. And it means nothing. Could one imagine the council declaring that it "DECIDES this is the last time it will debate this tiresome issue"? Very few problems in international relations disappear, and neither, presumably, will the council and its deliberations.  Vapidity has its fascinations. The resolution EXPRESSES condolences to Iraqis on terrorist attacks (sympathy rarely extended to Israelis, but that's another matter), TAKES NOTE of upcoming meetings of the Governing Council in Iraq, APPEALS for strengthened efforts to be benevolent, and EMPHASIZES, REMINDS, REQUESTS and AFFIRMS all manner of good things. However, it spends not one euro, equips no soldier and dispatches no relief worker. Cohen then examines the various states' rationales (if any) for supporting the resolution and ends on this note:  In domestic politics our leaders understand the need to cloak harsh realities with formulas that all can live with. It's far more important to do so in international politics, and wiser by far for a government to show a courteous desire for the support of others than to revel in the dubious pleasures of sauntering alone in dark places.   That said, let no one mistake words for material aid, unanimity for anything other than cold-blooded calculation, and "authority" for moral sanction.  The burdens will remain ours, and the merit of the war will depend on how we win the peace, not on the woolly phrases of diplomats. [emphasis added]   Yup.

       THE PERILS OF SOCRATES .   urlLink The Curmudgeonly Clerk  has an post decrying the Socratic Method used in near every law school.  ...everyone who has sat through a first year law school class knows that the Socratic Method is an actual impediment to learning. Any law student can regale you with tales of the inefficacy and inefficiency of this pedagogical (mal)practice.  On occasion, students do manage to exact their revenge, however. One day in my first year Criminal Law class, the professor was mercilessly grilling a rather reticent female student. He asked her to recite the facts of a case. When she began a meandering recital replete with irrelevancies, he began to mock her. He proceeded to interrogate her; each question was dripping with sarcasm and condescension. The purport of his inquiries could not have been more clear: he wanted her to focus solely on the material facts. She, however, was too befuddled and flustered to grasp his point. So the professor proceeded to the student seated next to her and asked, "Why am I mocking her?" Unfortunately for the professor, this student was honest to a fault. Without pause, he responded, "Because you are a jerk."   My thoughts: The SM can be very useful in exposing faulty or incomplete reasoning. But oftentimes profs will use the SM to throughly confuse a student and the class but then NOT PROVIDE THE RIGHT ANSWER. That borders on criminal. Yeah, we get it, we don't know the answer. We've tried, we don't know where you're going. Enough. What's the rule already?!  That's the danger of the SM, you have to take it to its completion. Socrates knew it and did it. Law profs sometimes don't and won't. Otheriwse, it just serves to confuse the hell out of lowly students trying to intuit the correct answer out of the ether, and usually getting it wrong.

       INSTAHATRED AND WHY BLOG WHY?    urlLink Pejman  has an excellent post on the tendency of left-leaning bloggers to be filled with oodles of animosity for  urlLink Senor Reynolds .  Now, the gist of many of the comments to Pejman's post seems to be that Reynolds doesn't really respond to criticism or correct his mistakes as often as he should. Which raises an interesting question:   What is the purpose/power of a blog?   I guess for most it's just a place to rant and rave a lil bit and commit some small portion of our thoughts and ideas to text so that when we're old(er) and gray(er), we can look back and say "Look, grandpa had  passion , damn it!" It's our tiny little slice of immortality and/or our attempt to write the Great American Novel, one pithy linked post at a time.   Now, what seems lost on most of those so critical of Reynolds as a "right wing hack" is that Instapundit isn't a giant, bureacratized institution prone to indifference and stagnation.  It's a guy. One guy. One guy with a PC and an internet connection. Yes he's the most popular blogger, but jesus, IT'S A BLOG. 90% of the country doesn't know what the hell a blog is let alone who the biggest fish in this exceptionally small pond is.  But all that aside, suppose blogs really DO have an inordinate amount of influence over "Big Media" such that  uberbloggers  like Reynolds can influence the news cycle?  So what?   First off, the power of a blog is only as strong as what it links too.  Without regular journalism to link to, blogs would be deader than dirt.  Blogs don't make news, they react to it. They're 500,000 mini op-ed pages all clamoring to be read and (generally) taken seriously.  Without their Energon of regular news stories to sustain them, the blogging  urlLink Autobots  and  urlLink Decepticons  would be nothing more than a bunch of internet cranks.   So what form should a blog take?  I see three paths: (1) Primarily linking, little commentary. (most news clearinghouse sites-- urlLink Lucianne  comes to mind) (2) Primiarily commentary, few links--or links so embedded in the commentary that you have to slog through "Dissertation #45" to get to it--this approach is dangerously close to cranker-Ville (3) Fair balance of links and commentary.  I think Reynolds falls into this third category. He opines at some length on some topics, but not most. As such, people who don't really feel like reading a full, article length post ABOUT a news article can get, with a fair amount of consistency, links to topics they find interesting with quick comments as to why Reynolds thinks they are interesting.   Personally, the most appealing sites to me are these "balanced" sites. I don't want to read drawn out posts (like this one). I want links to interesting articles that either support or challenge my beliefs. But since I'm impatient, I want to know,  briefly , whether I should bother reading the damn thing.   Which is why Instapundit is so darn popular and I am, as yet, not.

       THIS IS NEW IMPERIALISM?   The Telegraph has an  urlLink article  with this intro:  America is stumbling into what appears to be a new imperial mission which puts a premium not on firepower but on "psyops", or psychological operations, according to a growing number of historians and strategists.  After the September 11 attacks, the United States military has found itself fighting a new kind of war in Central Asia and the Middle East, which place American troops among civilians who may not be friends, but cannot be treated as enemies. Nowhere in the article is  urlLink Max Boot  cited or quoted.   But here's the kicker: To British ears, this "war on terrorism" carries strong echoes of  "the savage wars of peace" , Rudyard Kipling's description of the imperial mission in his poem, the White Man's Burden. How do you write an article like this, actually  using  Kipling's quote--the  title  of Boot's book, and not talk to Boot?   That's just weird.

       LIEBERMAN'S "STREAMLINING" OR FALTERING?    Interesting report from the Forward saying that  urlLink a number of fundraisers are leaving Lieberman's campaign .  Also from the article:  As the Forward reported last week, consultant Shari Yost and Mid-Atlantic fundraising director Stephanie Friedman Schneider recently departed, in an echo of an earlier staff shakeup that operatives said was an indication that Lieberman's fundraising operation is losing steam. Add this to Joe's decision not to take part in the Iowa caucuses makes one wonder how strong (or weak) the Liberman camp is at this point.   My money is on the downward slide. And the more I think about it, the more I'm kind of depressed. I actually like Lieberman. He's the only consistently pro-war candidate up there and has repeatedly held to that position even when it was obviously unpopular to his audience.  I respect the hell out of that.    Of course, I disagree with him on mostly all his domestic politics, but that's fine. He at least has enough conviction to recognize the unique and inescapable position the US is in re: the War on Terror.  I think his is an important voice whose failure to garner support in the Democratic party (either because of his loss in 2000 or his pro-war position) speaks volumes about where the Democratic party is headed.  The Republican in me wants his campaign to falter, the American in me is sad because it is.

       I RAMBLE, THEREFORE I AM.   Got into a semi-heavy email discussion with some of my classmates over Gen. Boykin's comments.  Needless to say, they were "Shocked and Offended(tm)."  In my response, posted below, I kinda went off on their general approach to warfare and terrorism.  **WARNING: RANT AHEAD**   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Know what'd be really cool though?  If the LA Times released the full transcripts and videos of the Boykin speeches...buuuutt......they won't.  That aside, what is the complaint about Boykin's speech? That it will piss off Muslims? What, they weren't ready to turn themselves into human party-favors ANYWAY?  Placating terrorists and their "moderate" supporters will not win ANY war (let alone this one). It will certainly not win a war against an ideologically driven enemy that shows neither restraint nor concern for who it murders in its attempts to establish a theocratic Islamic state.  Terrorism is used ONLY because it is believed to be effective. Nothing more. While it is often couched in rhetoric that terrorists "can't be reasoned with."  They can be.  But they only respond to the harsh realities that only total war can bring. If you respond to suicide attacks with committee meetings, then you merely reinforce the notion that the West is both cowardly and decadent.   This was true of the Kamikazes, and it is true of the Islamic Terrorists.  You remove the threat of Islamofascistic terrorism when you remove the incentive to commit such acts.  You remove the incentive when you make the consequences of such acts so horrible and painful to the individuals that commit them and the societies that sponsor them that no amount of Koran-thumping idiocy will convince them to fly planes into skyscrapers.  I drew the parallel to the Kamikazes, does this mean I recommend nuking Riyadh? No. Islamic terror states have not advanced to the point of militarism and mass "psychosis" that the Japanese did such that we'd face millions of Saudis (or Syrians, or Egyptians, or Iranians) ready to commit sepuku if we invaded.  The attacks on Coalition troops are troubling, but they are the product of an ineffective minority whose only hope is that we prove as cowardly as they claim and that we choose to flee and surrender a country of 25 million to a group less than 1/20th that size.  We have a commitment to our soldiers. But we also have a commitment to history.  The pissant barkings of corrupt Arab kleptocracies and spineless European bureaucrats will matter little in the final analysis when the choice is between freeing 25 million from the grip of a murderous tyrant or trying to adhere to some outdated and corrupt notion of "international law" advocated by those same corrupt states in the General Assembly.   Make no mistake, that IS the choice we face. You can complain about the tactics, you can complain about whether this or that convoy route is the safest. You can complain about who should draft an Iraqi constitution or what authority should the Coalition Provisional Authority grant the governing council next week. Those objections are all fine and admirable. But they are mere flyspecks in the grand campaign that is the war against terrorism. Germany did not have elections for 4 years following the end of World War II. Life Magazine complained, not 6 months after the fall of the Reich that the US was "losing the peace" in the reconstruction of Germany.  Take that into consideration.  We did not choose for 3000 of our countrymen to be murdered.  But it happened. And an aroused and angered free Western society is a terrible sight to behold.  Yamamoto was more than prescient to say, after Pearl Harbor that "I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve."  We did not choose this war. But seeing it through to its completion has become our burden. And as we have done throughout our history, we will do so stoically, fiercely, and completely.

       AREN'T UNIONS FUN?   urlLink 2 pickets face charges in attack .  The 27-year-old replacement worker had just left the Ralphs supermarket on East Palomar Street in Chula Vista early Friday morning when his car was followed by the two pickets "apparently attempting to run it off the road," Gregg said.  The two used their car to block his vehicle at the Main Street on-ramp to northbound Interstate 805, and everyone got out of their cars, he said.  One of the men then struck the replacement worker in the face and chest with a baseball bat. The other man punched the replacement worker, Gregg said. The two men also knocked out the back windows of the replacement worker's car. Charming.

       THERE'S A NEW WRINKLE IN THE ANGRY LEFT PLAYBOOK .  We've gone from "Bush LIIIIIIED! to "Bush IMPLIIIIIIED!"  If this is what the DNC is banking on for November...yeesh.   **BEGIN COMPLETELY PREMATURE ELECTION PREDICTIONS**   None of the Dems are running on anything other than being "Anti-Bush." That's great for energizing the rabid angry Left, but it doesn't win general elections (see: 1996). None have offered any alternative plans for dealing with terrorism or with Iraqi reconstruction other than to say either (1) "Bush LIIIEEEED!" or (2) "Bush IMPLIIIIIED!"  It might not matter to the NYT or LAT, but nat'l security and terrorism still matter to that great swath of land known as flyover country to the elites.  Also, for all the hype about Wesley Clark, he hasn't shown anything yet and is unlikely to do so. His campaign has stalled and he's still behind Dean in NH and Iowa. He looks a lot LESS impressive in a regular suit than a general's uniform--and the uniform was his sole selling point.   As for the economy, well, that's always a tossup, but Bush I lost in 92 because the recovery that was in place hadn't yet gathered enough steam. That isn't likely to happen to GWB, the economy IS recovering (predicted 4-5% increase in GDP this year or next, can't recall) and a good number of the economic criticisms will ring hollow come election time if the economy continues on this upward trend (since by that time you should be seeing more jobs). And once you get around election time, nobody will want to hear about their taxes being raised when their economic lot is improving.  Dems NEED both the economy and Iraqi reconstruction to fail in order to win...which is rather reprehensible when you think about it. But that's how it is...  But at this early early stage in the game, I think Bush can easily defeat Dean (with Reaganite numbers), but would have a slightly tougher, but ultimately successful time against Kerry/Gephardt/Clark (like 53%-47%)

       CLOONEY TO RUN ON THE "GIANT COCK" PLATFORM.   That's really the only way to take Actor George Clooney's "announcement that  urlLink America's too prudish for real politicians. .   Hollywood actor George Clooney says American society is too prudish -- one of the reasons why he would not follow his fellow actor Arnold Schwarzenegger into politics, he said in a published German magazine interview.  He told Woman magazine that Schwarzenegger's win this month in the California governorship race showed that candidates could only be successful in American politics if they denied things they did in earlier life. WHY do reporters ask actors about politics, and have you noticed it's mostly the foreign press that does it?  For all the charges of the US being shallow and vapid, the foreign press sure seems to bend over backwards to document the political opinions of the most shallow and vapid among us.   Clooney, a lifelong Democrat, also underscored his opposition to the US-led war in Iraq.  "I stand by that. It was the dumbest thing that my country could have done. As an actor in the public eye, I have a responsibility. I see myself as a spokesman for all those who have the same opinion," he said, in comments published in German. I still stand by the view that  urlLink Batman & Robin  is the dumbest thing our country could have done.

       LIL AMBER & JOHN ASHCROFT:   We were discussing  ASHCROFT V. FREE SPEECH COALITION , 535 U.S. 234 (2002).  I was somewhat less than prepared.  Well, really the only thing I missed was why  New York v. Ferber  458 U.S. 747 (1982) wasn't controlling.   Thing was, I had already done this case in 1st Amendment Law and knew it, I just couldn't believe the Professor had gotten through the class list a full second time.  Hell, he already called on me the week before darn it!  Eh, I redeemed myself reasonably well I think when I noted that the Court said that if Congress wanted to prevent the conduct that this virtual child porn led to (exploitation, seduction, etc), it should have criminalized the conduct itself, not the protected speech.   Then again, maybe not.    **END LAME ATTEMPT TO COVER ONE'S ASS** **BEGIN SEMI-SUBSTANTIVE POST**   Ok, so while I understand that you can't ban visual depictions that  appear  to be of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct, what do we say about sites like  urlLink Lil Amber  and similar "teen modeling" sites that seems pretty clearly directed towards a prurient interest (even if they may not wholly satisfy the  Miller  obscenity standards of being patently offensive and lacking serious social/literary/etc value)?  Can't such sites be constitutionally classified, by statute, as being child pornography? Or do such statutory definitions also fall prey to a  Miller -like analysis--at least in terms of sweeping in too much protected speech. (I.E., is the overbreadth hurdle easier to get over when defining child porn--so long as it involves REAL children?)   **UPDATE**  I went to the mountaintop ( urlLink Prof. Volokh ) and asked him the same question. Response is that  United States v. Knox , 32 F.3d 733 is on point. Case involved a prosecution under a federal child porn statute for possesion of videos that had minors in provacative poses in "abbreviated" clothing.  To quote LEXIS:  "The court affirmed the defendant's conviction, because the federal child pornography statute did not contain a requirement that the child subject's genitals or pubic area be fully or partially exposed or discernible, and the requirement of lasciviousness applied to the exhibition of the child's body rather any act, pose, or intent on the part of the child subject."

       FOR PEJMAN.  urlLink  Ivy Leaguers Play Chess With Inmates    In the end, two New Jersey State Prison inmates managed to defeat the students, while four others played them to draws. Fifty-eight inmates took part.   "I beat one of those guys," said Terrance Manley, 28, who is serving time for manslaughter. "And now I'm ready for the next one."   The Princeton students — after being frisked and ushered through the gates of the maximum-security prison — were struck by how the game could bring them into contact with people so different from them.   "It's about how you can take two diametrically opposed people and see how they relate," said Samson Benen, 18. "It's amazing."   Benen also noted how some of the prisoners played a different style of chess than the classical brand he was used to: "These players used more unusual positions."

       ARE THE COURTS INADVERTENTLY HARMING THE GAY RIGHTS CAUSE ? Prof Volokh has an interesting post which present a  urlLink very plausible scenario :  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decides that the state constitution secures a right to gay marriage. (Happened.) This substantially energizes and strengthens the pro-Federal Marriage Amendment forces, who are upset at what they see as 'judicial activism,' in any state, even one that's not their own. (Very likely, despite my post a few posts down; without the Defense of Marriage Act, it would have been nearly certain, I think, but now it's just very likely.)       The FMA is proposed and passes, because right now gay marriage is still not popular. (Quite likely.) The FMA prohibits all gay marriage, including that enacted by legislatures or the voters. (Quite likely; that's overbroad with respect to the interest in preventing judicial activism, but it's the current draft, which shows that some people like it -- and I doubt that most voters will focus too much on these details.) Ten, twenty, or thirty years from now, when people no longer object much to gay marriage (quite possible, given the trajectory of attitudes towards gay issues, and see here [thanks to InstaPundit for the pointer]), gay marriage will be constitutionally banned, and the constitutional prohibition will be very hard to undo (certain, given these hypotheses). And in the meantime, the symbolic message sent by the law will be 'gay marriage is so bad that the Constitution outlaws it' (depends on what you think of symbolism, but it seems to me quite likely).   **UPDATE**  urlLink BoiFromTroy  has many links to reactions and analyses of the Mass. decision.

       US AGREES TO INT'L CONTROL OF IRAQ TROOPS?  That's the headline from this  urlLink Independent  story:  The United States accepts that to avoid humiliating failure in Iraq it needs to bring its forces quickly under international control and speed the handover of power, Javier Solana, the European Union foreign policy chief, has said. Decisions along these lines will be made in the "coming days", Mr Solana told The Independent.   Needless to say, I'm somewhat skeptical. I can undertstand the charge that we don't have ENOUGH troops in Iraq--but does anyone really think that the EU/NATO/UN could run things better?   I could even see the claim if it said that in exchange for more international troops in the region, the US would agree to increased int'l authority. But there's nothing in the article saying that.  Right now the only "help" the US is getting is more int'l control over its own troops.  I'm thinking that Solana really misheard whatever it was that he heard along the same lines as people are reading that DoD memo re: the  Weekly Standard  piece as being a denial of the accuracy of the memo rather than merely a diplo-speak version of "Maybe so, Maybe no."  We need a new dictionary of diplo-speak so things like this don't happen again. Who's with me? Nah? Ok.

In a sign that the economic recovery is finally adding jobs, California gained almost 35,000 new jobs in October, the biggest job growth gain since December 2000, according to figures released Friday by the state Employment Development Depart-ment.   Statewide, unemployment dropped to 6.6 percent in October, down from 6.8 percent a year ago but up slightly from a revised 6.5 percent in Septem-ber.   In October, there were34,800 jobs added in California, the highest one-month gain in job growth since December 2000, when 38,700 jobs were added, according to EDD statistics.   California's job growth in the last month reflects a surge in job growth nationwide when 126,000 new jobs were created in October.

       TAD HIGHER THAN $300, YES?   urlLink Tax refunds expected to jump 27% . Taxpayers' refund checks will increase nearly 27% to an average $2,500 per family early next year, according to new forecasts from tax experts and economists, who say the windfalls will aid consumers, the economy and President Bush's re-election campaign. ... The biggest winners, Petz says, will be the approximately 10 million married couples with a combined income of $46,700 to $56,800. Those couples dropped from the 27% bracket to the 15% bracket.   Other winners will include parents who had their first child in 2003. They will be eligible for a $1,000 credit. Married couples may also receive benefits. I do believe we be in that bracket. Yay.

       WHAT ABOUT SIXTO?!   Mickey Kaus:  urlLink Bush is Pedro Martinez .  Not a bad metaphor drawn by Mickey from the  Rock the Vote!  Democratic debate.  The gist is that Bush is like Pedro in game 7 of the ALCS and the voters are Grady Little. Bush was our starter who has given us 7+ strong innings, but he's tiring now and we may need to bring in a fresh arm before he gives up a double to Matsui. (While I think Bush/Pedro still can give us a CG, it's a fun metaphor nonetheless)  Now this got me a-thinkin...if Bush is Pedro, who are the Democratic candidates?   John Kerry -- urlLink Joe Niekro . Not quite Hall of Fame Material, but put up respectable numbers using a pitch that waffles back and forth.   Wesley Clark --Michael Jordan. Banked on his basketball talent to get him a minor league contract. Potential to evolve into either a  urlLink Bo Jackson  or a  urlLink Deion Sanders . Both more answers to trivia questions than anything.    Rev. Al Sharpton -- urlLink Razor Shines . Cup-of-coffee guy whose only real appeal was a cool name.   Dennis Kucinich --The "player to be named later" in  urlLink Dick Radatz'  threat during a fight that he'd take on his diminutive opponent and "player to be named later."  Either that or  urlLink Bill "Spaceman" Lee .   Carol-Mosley Braun --Any one of the  urlLink Colorado Silver Bullets    Howard Dean -- urlLink Walt Weiss . Rookie of the Year. Impressive in his first outing, but unlikely to make a lasting impression on the game.    Dick Gephardt -- urlLink Mike Morgan.   Been around the game so long it's hard to imagine him NOT playing, or losing. He could have been  urlLink Jesse Orosco , but he never put up quite good enough numbers.   John Edwards -- urlLink Darren Dreifort .  Young, good looking, lots of hype. And a 47-56 record with a 4.36 ERA.   Joe Lieberman -- urlLink Kevin Gross . Nice guy. Had his moment in the sun as an All Star in 1988 as well as a no-no later in his career, but engenders no passion or solid fan base otherwise.

Such questions about  downloading Paris Hilton Sex Tapes  are the sorts of questions that only those that would want to  DOWNLOAD Paris Hilton Sex Tapes  would ask.  I am certain there are many places  RIGHT HERE  on the Interent where you can  download  the  Paris Hilton Sex Tapes  and then watch the  Paris Hilton Sex Tapes RIGHT HERE .   Truthfully though, all this talk of  DOWNLOADING PARIS HILTON SEX TAPES RIGHT HERE  on the Internet is leaving a bad taste in my mouth.

       MY NAVY JAG MOTIVATIONAL STATEMENT . For the hell of it, I'm posting the entirety of my motivational statement for the Navy JAG summer internship program:      Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by, that here obedient to their laws we lie.  --Simonides - Epitaph on the monument marking the Battle of Thermopylae  Choosing a quotation this Veteran’s Day that fully captures the spirit of the day has proven exceptionally difficult.  Shakespeare’s Saint Crispin’s Day Speech from Henry V is likely the most known.  But history is rife with other examples from the Spartans’ at Thermopylae to the tragic bravery of Pickett’s Charge at Gettysburg.  They all remind us that there are things larger than ourselves worth fighting for.  Our unique history has taught us that patriotism is risking yourself for someone you often do not know.  It is well I could not find a quotation, for that would be relying on risks taken by others.  That is a position I cannot abide.  My ability lies in law and my passion with my country.  And in that I believe I could best serve the latter as an intern with the US Navy JAG.  Respectfully,  Christopher Cross It's getting sent out tomorrow with the Air Force app and the rejection should be coming shortly thereafter. It should be noted I was limited to 100 words and that brief lil thing still went over the limit.

       MATRIX REVOLUTIONS=HIPPY 1970s CARTOON VERSION OF TOLKIEN?   Here's the last Matrix Revolutions review you'll ever want to read because after the crappy ass analogy I'm going to draw, you're going to unplug your PC and see if WiFi can also WiFLY.  Now, how many saw the 1980 Rankin/Bass  urlLink Return of the King  cartoon? If you remember, at one point, Samwise envisions a world without the One Ring after its destruction and the end of the War of the Ring.  In that flashback we see a lovely scene in the Shire where we see lovely little Hobbit children (presumably Sam's) laughing and cavorting...  ...with ORC BABIES!!!  Yup. Hobbits and Orcs living together. MASS HYSTERIA! This was the garbage that the 1979/1980 travesty that was Rankin/Bass foisted upon the masses with their "reading" of Tolkien.  The Orcs weren't inherently evil and twisted by the Dark Lord. They were just misunderstood sacs of sludge with unique skincare techniques.  So in that brief little "flash-forward" we get a glimpse of the hippy hell of irredeemably evil Orcs living in the Shire alongside our sympathetic idyllic Hobbits.  **WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE MATRIX?**SPOILERS** Glad you asked. Well, the "peace treaty" Neo signed with the Machines is basically the same sort of "co-existence" BS as in ROTK.  Not only is it completely antithetical to the very nature of the Machines (they don't suffer humanity's existence through any sort of goodwill--they grow us for energy-that's it), it's also a complete clusterf*** in terms of the whole plot of the original Matrix which was to FREE the humans from the blind slavery of the Matrix.  So we now have a "peace" whereby the Machines will release those that want out. Ok, presumably that's only those that subconsciously decide to get out, since any more than that would threaten the Machines' power supply.    Surely the Machines won't actually TELL people that their entire existence is a sham and that they are just grist for the mill, right? Ok, so presumably that means some more of the Zionistas will have to plug in to "enlighten" some of them.  Machines can't have that so what will they do? Load Agents into the program to prevent any "unauthorized liberation."  Zionistas won't like this, battle ensues. WE ARE RIGHT BACK WHERE WE FRIGGIN' STARTED!  Man did that movie bug the hell out of me.

But Richard Kahlenberg of the Century Foundation says that even though colleges claim they want poor kids, "they don't try very hard to find them."

        COLD MOUNTAIN.    Went and saw this film on Thursday afternoon with the wife and some of her friends.  I'll leave the questions of  urlLink historical accuracy  (a couple of which seem rather troubling given even my limited--but growing!--knowledge of the subject) to the experts.    All in all, the movie wasn't terrible. I enjoyed some the  Odyssey -esque aspect of it (I realize the book is Odyssey in 1964--and I liked that) where the main character tries to get home after the war (still during the war technically--the deserting bastard) and meets all sorts of colorful, humorous, wretched, and terrifying people/situations along the way.  I liked that general aspect of the story. The supporting roles were played well--from the lecherous preacher to the perpetually drunk "master of all sluts".  That being said, the  urlLink Financial Times  sums the lead characters up well:  The place is full of Britons, blagging away with southern accents.  Yeah, neither Nicole Kidman (who's an Aussie, I know) nor Jude Law sound terribly convincing in their attempts to "go native."  Renee Zelwegger sounds like she's a  Hee-Haw  reject--despite having such a horrid accent, her character is also one of the more interesting ones. But Law's character of Inman sounds downright retarded in his accent--he sometimes drops his voice so low and speaks so SLOOOOOOOOW that I half expect him to grab a rabbit and call it "George"  Ultimately though, the love story between Inman and Ada (Kidman) feels hollow. If it weren't for the overhanging threat of war and the insanely difficult circumstances it throws these two people into--the romance would have NOTHING going for it.   On top of that, the movie DRAGS.  I knew I was in trouble when I kept thinking of scenes in the preview that I'd seen but were as yet, nowhere to be found in the film and knowing that the film couldn't rationally introduce them--leading to the conclusion that we had SOME TIME left before getting to those moments.  On the positive side: Colorful side characters, good period mountain music, excellent depiction of The Crater at Petersburg (with some minor historical quibbles--notably the lack of black troops in the Crater--I saw one, his name was Token).  Final score? eh, 6/10

       NOTE TO SELF: NEVER WIN THE LOTTERY.   urlLink Richest lottery winner wishes he'd been quieter .    The letters never stop. Requests, pleas, hard-luck stories, tales to break your heart: thousands of them, enough to fill hip-high filing cabinets that line three conference-room walls in Andrew "Jack" Whittaker's new office.   They come by the dozens, day after day, though it has been a year since Whittaker won the richest undivided lottery jackpot in U.S. history -- $314.9 million, payable in an after-tax lump sum of $113 million -- in a Christmas Day drawing.   "I can't even read them," Whittaker said. "I wouldn't have any money left if I did." Two words:  Cat Juggling   Now, as sympathetic as one can feel towards a man with $314 million dollars, there's this:  During a July foray to a West Virginia strip club, Whittaker opened a briefcase filled with $545,000 in cash and cashier's checks in front of a club employee. Whittaker was soon drugged, and the briefcase was stolen, police said.   The money was found, and two club employees were arrested.   But the incident put a spotlight on Whittaker's habits, which police said included frequent strip-club visits and high-stakes gambling at a dog track and casino.   Of course, the article does say his business has expanded, he's hired more people and given about $7m to charity...sooo....*I* am willing for forgive the dumbness of the strip club fiasco. Isn't that big of me?

       MANA FOR BASEBALL BLOGGERS .  urlLink Inside The Park Baseball  is an amazing baseball simulation game from the makers of Out of the Park Baseball. Unlike most games where you are the general manager or owner or some other bigwig--in ITP you're....YOU.   You have to train, assign points in an RPG type system to determine your strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, etc.  You can start out in the low minors--(I started out as a 5th round draft pick (132d overall) by Florida with a $50,000 signing bonus--started out in AA at a whopping $350/wk.  Didn't do too well, had a 4.46 ERA, but I was the teams' workhorse--appearing in 72 games.  I was promoted in 2004 to AAA and appeared in 20 games, posting a 1.93 ERA before getting called up early June.  Right now, I've only appeared in 11 games thus far (I'm something of a spot lefty) but my ERA has been falling consistently and it's down to 4.91 right now.  The game is only $19.95--and it will suck whatever free time you have away.

       Purdue signs wrong Jason Smith to basketball letter of intent .   urlLink Hoosier Gazette  reports:  On the first day of the early signing period for high school basketball players, Purdue used their one available scholarship to sign Yorktown High’s 5-foot-6, 128 pound Jason Smith, an honor student who has never played competitive basketball in his entire life.    Purdue had intended to sign Yorktown’s OTHER Jason Smith, a 6’6” 215 lb. point guard who averaged 26 points and 11 assists per game last season.  This Jason was named to Blue Chip Magazine’s Top 50 players in the nation.  It seems the mix up occurred in the counselor’s office Wednesday morning when the latter Jason’s scholarship papers arrived via FedEx.  Counselor Edith Woodrow mistakenly thought the documents were applications that needed to be signed and returned by the non-athletic Jason to apply for Purdue’s Sallie Mae Fund Scholarship Program, which assists low-income students with tuition and fees.   Adding to the confusion is that both Jasons share the same middle initial, “P”.  Nerdy Jason’s middle name is “Parker”, while athletic Jason’s is “Paul”. And the best part?  The Boilermakers have a serious problem on their hands.  They cannot force Jason Parker Smith to give up the scholarship without facing a great deal of bad publicity for cutting a player who has not violated team rules, and the young man does not plan on giving it up voluntarily.   And the brainy Smith says he has no qualms about keeping the scholarship since he's worked hard his whole life to earn his 3.8 GPA. Heh.

The completely premature tally as to how I think I did (out of 10):   Intro To Appellate Advocacy:  7 (wrote a fine brief, my oral argument could've been better)  1st Amendment Law:   8 (I think I did rather well on my exam, though hopefully he won't look too much into my mistakenly thinking that the NRA and NOW were not corporations for purposes of BCRA)  Con Law II :  9 (I owned this damn test. I guessed the essay question word for word and the only question mark is whether the multiple choice tripped me up.  Ethical Lawyering:  6 (Eh.)  Evidence:  5 (More eh.)  Now I get to go see  Return of the King  and finally go on a honeymoon.

       DENNIS MILLER'S NEW SHOW .  Just watched it on Tivo.  Not bad. Lil clunky at times, but Miller had a good intro and the show generally flowed well.  At the midpoint he does his traditional "newsy" monologue with jokes.  There's no studio audience, so sometimes he looked like he was waiting for a laugh when all that's there is the crew.  He was funny though.  His first guest was Arnold. Not a bad interview, not a hardball one either--Miller said at the beginning of the show he'd prefer to let people talk than appear to be preening and interrupt them at every turn.  And he made good on that...sometimes to the detriment of the "flow"  Final segment was a panel with David Horowitz, Naomi Wolf, and David Frum.  The discussed Kay a lil bit as well as New Hampshire.  Very good panel with very smart people. Hopefully they'll be recurring.  Miller could have tried to keep them on track a lil bit more.  Since well, these are people that can talk for HOURS on the subject and they've got maybe 1 minute.    Final analysis:  Good start, needs to be a LITTLE more lively to make up for the fact that there is no audience there.  But I liked it. Tomorrow is John McCain.

       CHENEY: CIVIL WAR BUFF AND VICTOR DAVIS HANSON FAN .   urlLink Really interesting profile of Dick Cheney  in the Oakland Trib.  Of note:  One of Cheney's favorite recent books is "An Autumn of War," a collection of essays published by historian Victor Davis Hanson in National Review after 9/11. Hanson, a scholar of ancient Rome and Greece and a senior fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institute, believes that bloodshed is a natural condition of humanity. Evil exists in the world and the evildoers need to be met head-on.   In October 2002, during the run-up to the Iraq invasion, Cheney invited Hanson to the vice president's mansion for a meeting followed by dinner. Cheney said little but asked many questions.   "He does believe there's sort of a tragic vision in the world," says Hanson, a Democrat who says he came away impressed with Cheney. "He's not one of these ideologues that says he doesn't trust the U.N. or Europe. But human nature being what it is, he has a very realistic view that you can't be afraid to act, even if it's not popular."    I knew I liked the guy.

       RANDY BARNETT AT LOYOLA LAW SCHOOL.       Restoring the Lost Constitution: The Presumption of Liberty   Wednesday, March 3 5:00-6:00pm Loyola Law School--Hall of the 80s 919 S. Albany Street Los Angeles CA   Featuring :  Randy Barnett , Boston University School of Law  With Commentary by :  Kurt Lash , Loyola Law School Admission is Free, All are Welcome  The Loyola Law School Chapter of the Federalist Society is proud to host Professor  Randy Barnett  as he talks about his new book,  Restoring the Lost Constitution: The Presumption of Liberty  with commentary by Loyola Law School Professor  Kurt Lash .   The U.S. Constitution found in school textbooks and under glass in Washington is not the one enforced today by the Supreme Court. In  Restoring the Lost Constitution , Randy Barnett argues that since the nation's founding, but especially since the 1930s, the courts have been cutting holes in the original Constitution and its amendments to eliminate the parts that protect liberty from the power of government. From the Commerce Clause, to the Necessary and Proper Clause, to the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, to the Privilege or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court has rendered each of these provisions toothless. In the process, the written Constitution has been lost.  Please join us this Wednesday, March 3, from 5-6pm in the Hall of the 80s as these two distinguished scholars discuss this interesting and important topic.

       WHAT IS THE THREAT OF A KERRY-EDWARDS TICKET?   Got to thinking about this, and I couldn't really come up with a solid reason why a Kerry-Edwards is that GOOD of an idea.  Edwards hasn't done a THING in the campaign to distinguish himself from Kerry and went far out of his way to AGREE with him on nearly every substantive point at the debate in Los Angeles.  Don't you want the VP to be someone that brings something to the table that the candidate, for whatever reason, cannot?  Having better hair and a brighter smile is great in a candidate for the BIG office, but I don't see it as terribly useful in a VP candidate.  So Edwards brings what? A southern accent?  Hell, Bush has that, and a solid national security record to boot.  Edwards brings a rather murky position on national security, a murkier position on the economy ("Two Americas" aside--vast majority don't identify with the "other"), and a downright incomprehensible position re: gay marriage.  So I still just don't get what Edwards brings to Kerry other than better hair and boyish good looks.  I think I've figured it out:   John Edwards is Dan Quayle.

        THE PASSION  .  Went and saw the film today.  Now, I was raised Catholic. Never got confirmed, never practiced beyond the obligatory church attendance that my school required, so I don't really have an axe to grind here, but that being said, this is one tough movie to watch.  It's the most brutal thing I've ever watched.  It's also one of the most intense movies I've ever watched.  I freely admit to crying during it.  You're one hard-hearted SOB if you don't.  On the Anti-Semitism charges, this claim has merit if you only watch about 1/3 of the film.  Here are some of the objections I've seen most often and my responses after having seen the film.   The Jewish priests are portrayed poorly in their desire to kill Jesus .   True, except for those that expressly call the "trial" an outrage and want nothing to do with it, only to be ushered out by the rest.    The crowd that calls for Pilate to free Barabbas/crucify Jesus reflects poorly on Jews .   True, but it was also a crowd that was bought and paid for.  There is a scene earlier in the film where some of the Jewish soldiers go around passing out money to try to "get whoever you can" to show up at the trial.  Further, the crowd that follows Jesus as he is carrying his cross is mixed with those that support the spectacle, and those that are horrified at it.  Hardly a uniform indictment.     The film is too violent.    It's a remarkable conceit that people sometimes allow themselves in explaining for others what their faith should and should not contain. (I'll admit, I engage in that only insofar as "Don't blow me up" is a major tenet of a particular faith)  But to say that the film is too violent kind of defeats the whole purpose of focusing on the last 12 hours of Jesus' life.   When popular culture has taken a faith's savior and turned him into the "Buddy Christ", folks might need a lil reminder what exactly made him Jesus CHRIST instead of "Jesus, Man on Donkey."       The film doesn't focus enough on Jesus' teachings .   This is kind of in line with the violence objection.  It presumes to say what another's religious stories should and should not contain.  I think part of the reason that Jesus has become such a POP-culture icon is that society has NOT focused on his suffering and instead turned him into some pansy-fied New-Agey guru that walks around preaching "good times."  If the major facet of the faith was that Jesus suffered and died for the transgressions of man, it's probably good to be reminded of that in sufficiently forceful terms.  I don't want my savior to be like Eddie Murphy from "Holy Man" but without the melanin.      Pontius Pilate is potrayed sympathetically .   This is the toughest issue, I think if you view Pilate as having no power to affect the situation, then he comes across as semi-sympathetic.  I didn't view him that way though.  I saw him portrayed more as a snivelling little bureaucrat whose only goal was to retain his own position with as little trouble as possible.  So all the scences where he continually places the question of what is to be done to Jesus to the Priests, he's not doing it from any sense of sympathy towards him, but rather because he doeesn't want to be the one to make ANY decision.  There is a scene in which Pilate mentions the threat his position is under from Rome and how he is, in his eyes, bound to piss off at least ONE group no matter his decision re: Jesus.  But in the film it's still clear that the Priests must defer to the decisions of Pilate, but that Pilate is too much of a selfish panty-waste to do anything about it.  So he tries to "wash his hands" of the affair.  In my mind this isn't a sympathetic treatment.  He had the ability to not sentence Jesus to death.  And rather than do that, he shirked.  That ain't exactly a glowing portrait.    Finally, as I said I am not a practicing Catholic, but I will say that from all the reading I've done about this film and the film itself has certainly caused something of an internal debate for myself.  I'm more interested than I have been in years about re-entering the Church (maybe even getting ACTUALLY confirmed...who knows), and learning more about my faith.    After having seen what one man went through for me, that's the LEAST I could do.

       I AM TAKING CONFLICT OF LAWS THIS SEMESTER.  So obviously the issue of gay marriage is fairly relevant. So I found this list of questions which basically are conflicts questions that   urlLink David Frum has posed to Andrew Sullivan on the issue.   Now, I generally like Sullivan's writing, but as he himself has said, is not a constitutional scholar/lawyer (reader?), so when he goes off on how clear and obvious the result of his pet issue should be, I get a lil queasy.  Anyway.  Frum's piece is a Conflicts scholar's wet dream, some of which include:   1) A Massachusetts man buys a condo in Miami. He marries another Massachusetts man. The condo purchaser dies before he can write a new will. Who inherits the condo?   2) Two Massachusetts women marry. One of them becomes pregnant. The couple split up, and the woman who bore the child moves to Connecticut. The other woman sues for visitation rights. What should the Connecticut courts do?  3) A Massachusetts man is accused of stock fraud. The federal Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenas his spouse. The spouse claims marital privilege and refuses to answer the SEC’s questions. May the SEC compel him to answer anyway?  4) A Massachusetts woman marries another Massachusetts woman. The relationship sours. Without obtaining a divorce, she moves to Texas and marries a man. Has she committed bigamy?  5) Two married Massachusetts men are vacationing in another state. One of them has a stroke. The hospital concludes he will never recover. Local law requires the hospital to ask the next of kin whether to continue treatment. Whom should it ask?  6) A Massachusetts man marries a foreign visitor to the United States. Should the foreigner be entitled to US residency?  7) A Delaware family set up a trust for their son. The son moves to Massachusetts, marries a man, and then gets divorced. The trust is the son's only financial asset. Should the Massachusetts take the trust into account while dividing up the couple’s possessions? If yes, what happens when the Delaware trustees refuse to comply?  8) A Massachusetts woman married to another woman wins a lawsuit against a California corporation. She dies before she can collect her debt. Her closest blood relative demands that the corporation pay the relative, not the surviving spouse. Who should get the money?   Man this class is gonna suck.

       BUSH AND THE FMA--ROPE A DOPE?   The alternate title for this post is "Worst Theory Ever by a Blogger," but here it is:  Bush isn't serious about the FMA.  He's proposed it, knowing or suspecting full well it won't pass but does it to placate the base and still an entire day of primary coverage from Kerry/Edwards.   So he proposes the FMA to highlight the problem of activist judges and is really willing to accept some more of his judicial nominees as a compromise.  The means of doing this?  By calling for the FMA so publicly, he can press on the Dems in the Senate to either put up or shut up.  Bush basically says: "Ok, I'm going to FORCE you to take a position on the issue that has totally split your party. Or we can work something out--let's talk turkey, or Miguel Estrada."  As Gene Wilder would say:  IT! COULD! WORK!

       MY THOUGHTS ON THE PRESIDENT'S CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT PROPOSAL.   Since I've been up to my neck in gay marriage lately, I had kinda hoped such an amendment would pass since it would make writing my brief SO much easier.   That being said, my own position on the amendment is somewhat murky.  I think it all depends on the wording of the thing (fancy that, an amendment's language being relevant.  While I am not in favor of same sex marriage as currently proposed (that's a post for a different day)--I would support the constitutionalization of the DOMA.  I don't think States should be REQUIRED to recognize the same sex unions of other states.    Where I object to the proposal is where it attempts to define marriage forthe states. Of course, there is some doubt whether having the amendment say "Marriage in the United States shall be between a man and a woman" would actually preclude the states from allowing for gay marriage.  It COULD be read as merely precluding gay marriage at the federal level since the language isn't as sweeping as the XIII banning slavery "...in the United States, [or] any place subject to their jurisdiction."  Without that sentence though, it's basically the DOMA at the Constiututional level.  But if that limitation on marriage is read to apply to the states, then I'd oppose the amendment on federalism grounds.  See, wasn't that easy?

       FINALLY FINISHED MY MOOT COURT COMPETITION BRIEF.   That's why I haven't blogged a thing in the past month.  I finished writing on Monday but spent the next two days editing.  It was an interesting topic that I am quite certain I screwed up royally on.  The questions presented were:   I.  Whether the right to procreate is fundamentally inconsistent with one’s status as a prisoner and if so, whether a restriction on that right is justified by being rationally related to the legitimate penological interests of prison safety and security.   II.  Whether a California State prison warden must recognize same sex unions performed in another state under the Equal Protection, Due Process, or Full Faith and Credit Clauses of the U.S. Constitution.   I was assigned the side of the Respondent (the State) and argued the state (California) does not have to let a prisoner procreate while in prison and that it need not recognize his Vermont civil union.   urlLink You can see the brief here and remind me of all the typos I missed and cases I ignored.   Here are my point headings:   I.  THE RIGHT TO PROCREATE UNDER DUE PROCESS DOES NOT SURVIVE INCARCERATION BECAUSE IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY INCONSISTENT WITH ONE’S STATUS AS A PRISONER.  A.  IMPRISONMENT NECESSARILY LIMITS A PRISONER’S RIGHTS TO MARRIAGE AND INTIMATE ASSOCIATION B.  A PRISONER’S RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM FORCED STERILIZATION DOES NOT TRANSLATE INTO A RIGHT TO PROCREATE WHILE INCARCERATED   II.  EVEN IF THE RIGHT TO PROCREATE SURVIVES INCARCERATION, ITS RESTRICTION IS VALID AS IT IS REASONABLY RELATED TO THE LEGITIMATE PENOLOGICAL INTERESTS OF PRISON SECURITY AND SAFETY  A.  RESTRICTING INMATE PROCREATION FOR PRISON SAFETY SATISFIES  TURNER’S  REASONABLENESS INQUIRY B. REQUIRING PRISONER PROCREATION WOULD UNDULY BURDEN PRISON STAFF AND THERE ARE NO READY ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE TO THE PRISON   III.  THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE DOES NOT REQUIRE RECOGNITION OF SAME-SEX UNIONS BECAUSE HOMOSEXUALITY IS NOT A SUSPECT CLASSIFICATION ENTITLED TO HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY  A.  EQUAL PROTECTION PERMITS LEGISLATIVE CLASSIFICATIONS THAT DISADVANTAGE GROUPS OR PERSONS B.  HOMOSEXUALITY HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN HELD TO BE A NON-SUSPECT CLASSIFICATION ENTITLED TO NO MORE THAN RATIONAL BASIS REVIEW C.  THE STATE’S RESTRICTION ON SAME-SEX UNIONS SATISFIES RATIONAL BASIS REVIEW D.  NEITHER VERMONT’S  BAKER  DECISION NOR MASSACHUSETTS’  GOODRIDGE  DECISION FOUND A RIGHT TO SAME-SEX UNIONS UNDER FEDERAL LAW   IV.  DUE PROCESS DOES NOT REQUIRE THE STATE TO RECOGNIZE SAME-SEX UNIONS BECAUSE THE ABILITY TO MARRY ONE OF THE SAME SEX IS NOT A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT  A.  THE DECISION IN  LOVING V. VIRGINIA  CANNOT BE EXTENDED TO INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO MARRY ONE OF THE SAME SEX BECAUSE THE FREEDOM TO MARRY WAS PREDICATED ON THE FREEDOM TO PROCREATE  B.  THE DECISION IN  LAWRENCE V. TEXAS  DID NOT CREATE A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO MARRY ONE OF THE SAME SEX C.   LAWRENCE  WAS LIMITED TO THE CRIMINALIZTION OF PRIVATE CONDUCT, NOT THE RECOGNITION OF SAME-SEX UNIONS   V.  THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE RECOGNITION OF SAME-SEX UNIONS BECAUSE IT VIOLATES CALIFORNIA’S LEGITIMATE PUBLIC POLICY AND FEDERAL LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE SUCH RECOGNITION    So there you have it. I think I did a halfway decent job. Though we shall see by March 22...then I get to argue both sides on oral argument and not advance to the next round of the competition. Heh.

       THE UBIQUITY OF HITLER.   Flipping channels the other night and I came across the new video from the band Incubus called "Megalomaniac"  urlLink video can be found here   The video has an obvious anti-Bush message (I won't say anti-war, since I don't think they put even that much thought into it)  But while watching it, I was struck by how often they used Nazi and Hitlerian imagery in the video.  Everything from pictures of Jesus morphing into Hitler to thousands of Hitlers saluting a President who is drinking oil...  There's something really off-putting about such a cavalier invocation of Hitler and Nazism by the left.  I mean, what kind of cognitive dissonance do you have when "Hitler", the Swaztika, or "Nazi" become catch-alls for things/positions you don't particularly like?  Anyway, I need to get back to my brief. Just throwing it out there.

       FRANKEN TODAY.   I listened to about an hour of Franken today when he had Bob Kerrey as his first guest.  In all, it wasn't THAT great, wasn't terrible. Franken has a female co-host of sorts that is his Robin Quivers...she laughs a bit too much at his jokes and serves basically as a cheerleader. (Case in point:  "Hi, welcome back, my name is X...and YOU know who the host is!")  I thought the interview, such as it was, with Kerrey was passable from a lefty perspective, but ultimately was Franken and co-host trying to get Kerrey to give some credence to some weirdy conspiracies re: 9/11 and the Bush Administration.  Kerrey left, then Chuck D came on with Franken and I found myself in the surreal position of listening to Chuck D discuss international trade.  I turned it off.

"Soros, Out of Ukraine! You'll get nothing here!" the Ukrainians shouted as they carried out their protest Wednesday, the Interfax news agency reported. They were immediately detained and led away by security personnel.   Soros said he doubted it was just an ordinary incident. "Somebody is behind this," he was quoted as saying by Interfax.

       AIR SOUTH-AMERICA?  Today is the scheduled launch of the new  urlLink all-liberal talk radio network, Air America.    But you wouldn't know it in the Los Angeles area as the station it's supposed to air on, KBLA 1580 AM, had a decidedly....ummm.... Latin  flavor as late as 10:30 this morning.   In other words, when 1580 wasn't playing "Funkytown", "Hotel California", or "Billy Jean", it was entirely in Spanish.   I mean, I get that they want to be all inclusive and such, but that might be a bit much. Hehe.   UPDATE: Like any good liberal, it seems they don't get up around to working until around 12pm. hehe.

       FINISHED ORAL ARGUMENTS TODAY.   Man was that draining. I think I did passably well--the common criticism I rec'd from the judges? "Tone it down."  Apparently I am a fairly intense individual while behind the podium such that one justice said I looked like I wanted to leap over the desk and throttle the panel.  But at the same time, each judge I heard from (6 total--2 arguments with 3 judges each) said I had a very strong presence but that it might be TOO strong for moot court and that I should bring it down below 11.  Indeed the judge that said I was  uber -intense also said that he hopes I advance and said that was the "highest compliment I can give."  So we shall see...all in all, my brain fried and I want to go see a movie.

       OH  THOSE  FOREIGN LEADERS.   urlLink Kerry Attacks Venezuela's Chavez .   CARACAS, Venezuela (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry has attacked Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez as a dubious democrat hostile to U.S. interests, delivering a slap in the face to the leftist leader who had portrayed Kerry as a potential friend.   The Kerry statement on his Web site made front-page news in Venezuela on Monday, nearly two weeks after Chavez had publicly praised the Democrat contender, hailing his health care plans and likening him to assassinated U.S. President John Kennedy.   In his declaration dated March 19, the Massachusetts senator accused Chavez of undermining Venezuela's democracy, supporting Colombian rebels and "narco-terrorists" and trying to torpedo a constitutional bid by foes to hold a referendum on his rule.    For those keeping score, we now have as openly supporting John Kerry for President, the following foreign leaders:  1  urlLink Stalinist  1  urlLink Anti-Semite  1  urlLink Socialist  1 Castro clone (see above).

       CONGRESS SEEKS TO OVERTURN SCOTUS.   urlLink Congressional Accountability for Judicial Activism Act of 2004  .  Some Congressional members have introduced a bill "To allow Congress to reverse the judgments of the United States Supreme Court. "  The act says that  The Congress may, if two thirds of each House agree, reverse a judgment of the United States Supreme Court--  (1) if that judgment is handed down after the date of the enactment of this Act; and  (2) to the extent that judgment concerns the constitutionality of an Act of Congress.  Here is the  urlLink press release  from Kentucky Congressman Ron Lewis (R) who proposed the bill.  The bill claims its authority from Art III, Sec 2 of the Constitution. (Questionable at best). My bet is that the law won't go anywhere...but it is an interesting attempt to rein in a Court perceived to be out of control.

Since the CCM world didn't offer enough selection to be truly discriminating, my friends and I tended to gravitate toward those who'd made their bones in the secular world--closer to what we actually wanted to be listening to. It was our sincere hope that though they were singing for Jesus now, our new idols had once snorted their weight in cocaine and boinked arenas-full of groupies. It was bad for the soul, we reasoned, but good for the music. We liked Kerry Livgren because he'd co-founded the group Kansas, Joe English, because he'd been a drummer for Wings, and Leon Patillo, because he'd played keyboards for Santana. Never mind that I hated both Kansas and Wings, or that the Santana résumé-sweetener was nothing to brag about (considering they had 16 lineup changes from 1966 to 1984 alone, it's quite possible that I played keyboards for Santana, and just don't remember).

       INTERESTING STRATEGY BY KERRY .   Kerry has challenged Bush to  urlLink a debate a month.   It strikes me as a somewhat backwards strategy since if you're ahead in the polls (as Kerry is at this point), you want to keep quiet and let the other guy call for debates while you remain the classy front-runner.    I suppose all this gets turned on its head when facing an incumbent President because it burden is usually on the challenger to make himself known to the populace and an incumbent can, for the most part, play it easy and remain "presidential."  Of course, this could just be a means by which Kerry attempts to counter the Bush campaign's efforts to define Kerry's candidacy for him.  Eh, who knows.

       DEMS ARE "ENERGIZED"?  NOT SO FAST.    urlLink Democratic turnout seen so-so, despite party assertions .  WASHINGTON -- Turnout in the Democratic primaries, heralded by party leaders as a strong showing of unity and outrage against President Bush, was actually in line with past primaries, lower than many recent Republican contests, and included some record lows in later states, according to a full accounting released yesterday.  At the height of this year's presidential primaries, on Feb. 20, Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe declared that "people are turning out in record numbers" -- even though in the Virginia primary 10 days earlier, the 7.5 percent of Democrats who voted failed to match the only previous Democratic primary, and the figure was well below the 13.2 percent of Republicans who voted in their party's 2000 primary.   I like this.

       "ROBERT REDFORD...A HANDSOME GRADUATE STUDENT WITH WRINKLES ."  urlLink The Perpetual Adolescent .  Fine piece in the Weekly Standard on the glorification of the youth culture at the expense of "adulthood."   Two of the great television sitcom successes of recent years, "Seinfeld" and "Friends," though each is different in its comic tone, are united by the theme of the permanent adolescent loose in the big city. One takes the characters in "Seinfeld" to be in their middle to late thirties, those in "Friends" in their late twenties to early thirties. Charming though they may be, both sets of characters are oddly stunted. They aren't quite anywhere and don't seem to be headed anywhere, either. Time is suspended for them. Aimless and shameless, they are in the grip of the everyday  Sturm und Drang  of adolescent self-absorption. Outside their rather temporary-looking apartments, they scarcely exist. Personal relations provide the full drama of their lives. Growth and development aren't part of the deal. They are still, somehow, in spirit, locked in a high school of the mind, eating dry cereal, watching a vast quantity of television, hoping to make ecstatic sexual scores. Apart from the high sheen of the writing and the comic skill of the casts, I wonder if what really attracts people to these shows--"Friends" still, "Seinfeld" in its reruns--isn't the underlying identification with the characters because of the audience's own longing for a perpetual adolescence, cut loose, free of responsibility, without the real pressures that life, that messy business, always exerts.   ...  Consider contemporary journalism, which tends to play everything to lower and lower common denominators. Why does the New York Times, with its pretensions to being our national newspaper, choose to put on its front pages stories about Gennifer Flowers's career as a chanteuse in New Orleans, the firing of NFL coaches, the retirement of Yves Saint Laurent, the canceling of the singer Mariah Carey's recording contract? Slow-news days is a charitable guess; a lowered standard of the significant is a more realistic one. Since the advent of its new publisher, a man of the baby boomer generation, an aura of juvenilia clings to the paper. Frank Rich and Maureen Dowd, two of the paper's most-read columnists, seem not so much the type of the bright college student but of the sassy high-school student--the clever, provocative editor of the school paper out to shock the principal--even though both are in their early fifties.   Ouch.  Incidentally, as a firmly entrenched member of whatever generation my being 25 places me in (X? Y? BFD?), I can say with complete confidence:  To heck with the boomers.   Bunch of over-indulged, rudderless, equivocating, selfish, tragically trying to cling to a youth that has long since passed them by, needy, maladjusted, and ultimately useless bunches of carbon.   Bah! Off with their pony-tail'd heads!

       BEST. QUIZ. EVER.   urlLink Which Civil War General are You?     William Tecumseh Sherman:  Widely thought to be insane by most journalists for hating their questions, Sherman has been called one of the first generals to understand modern war.  His theory was that to win the war, the Union must break the Confederate's will to fight, as well as their means to carry on the war.  Needless to say, burning his way across Georgia and South Carolina did not earn him esteem from his opponents.  The phrase "War is Hell" is Sherman's. He is often considered callous to human loss of life, though in his mind the quicker the war could be won, the less lives that would be lost in the long run.   urlLink   Which Civil War General are You?    brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       CAMPAIGN BLOGS .

There's something awfully cute about seeing "Posted by Gary" at the end of each post.

       COURT CASES YOUR MOTHER NEVER TOLD YOU ABOUT.    urlLink XLRQ  notes the failure of the media to mention that the gay marriage issue isn't as uniform as it might seem in the courts. Specifically, he points out  Standhardt v. Superior Court of the State of Arizona , 77 P.3d 451.  I relied on this case quite a bit in my moot court competition brief in answering the question of whether a state must recognize a foreign state's same-sex union.  The case is important because it finds neither a right to same-sex marriage under either the AZ or US Constitutions and unlike the decision in  Goodridge , which found that the Mass. Constitution went BEYOND the US Constitution in what rights it provided, the AZ Constitution mirrors the US Const., at least insofar as the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses are concerned.  The AZ Supreme Court in  Standhardt   also distinguishes  Lawrence v. TX  as being inapplicable here since the court refused to find a fundamental right in homosexual sodomy, but instead applied rational basis review to strike down the TX statute as irrationally impinging on Lawrence's liberty to engage in private consensual sexual conduct without fear of criminal prosecution.  Lawrence also specifically distinguished itself from a (then) hypothetical case where a same sex couple sought formal government recognition for their relationship.  Justice Kennedy in the opinion suggested that in such a case, a statute refusing such recognition would satisfy the rational basis standard of review.  Ok, I don't want to write my brief again. (The AZ court also distinguished  Loving v Virginia , the interracial marriage case relied on most heavily by proponents of same-sex marriage) Scroll down, I've linked to both it and my point headings.

       ARE WE IMPERIALISTS OR ABSENTEE LANDLORDS?   urlLink  U.S. ignores turmoil in Americas, analysts say   Beset by political meltdowns and economic stagnation, much of Latin America is experiencing turmoil on a scale not seen since the 1980s. And U.S. leaders are barely paying attention. ... The Bush administration, meanwhile, is focused on Iraq and terrorism and -- except for free-trade negotiations -- largely avoids involvement in Latin America, several experts said.  Shifter said he has seen ''virulent anti-Americanism return,'' partly because of opposition to the war in Iraq and the perception that Bush cares only about stopping terrorism and trafficking.  Sweig agreed: ``It's not so much neglect as a narrow focus. And when this administration talks about promoting democracy, it's in countries such as Haiti and Venezuela, where they support the opposition.''  So if we attempt to involve ourselves in even the most cursory fashion, we're imperliasts seeking only to rape and plunder. But once we decide to NOT involve ourselves, we're accused of abandoning the region.  Nobody ever accused the Che-bots of consistency.

       MORE ON THE FMA.   I'm still of the mind that Bush isn't serious about the FMA.  He is far too shrewd to be taken in SO quickly where the support for an amendment would be EASY to ascertain.  Bush may think the FMA is a grand idea, but I don't think he'll fight too hard for it.  I think he proposed it for three reasons:  (1) To hand the Dems a political hot potato that will keep them hopping around like rabbits trying to define their increasingly narrow position on the issue and (2) To highlight the problem of activist judges/city officials such that GWB would be "willing to compromise" lest he actually push for the FMA. (3) This sets the stage for an easier sell once SCOTUS does rule on the issue.  More on (3)--by floating the FMA now, Bush gets most pols on record as something something like "Not yet, no need for it."  But once SCOTUS rules on the matter (lil fuzzy on whether they will or not), then you've passed that tipping point (assuming of course they find gay marriage as req'd under the 14th amendment or Full Faith and Credit Clause) to where those pols (and people) that were previously against the FMA as being premature would be more in favor it.  Basically, this is a trial balloon.

       QUICK THOUGHT ON BUSH'S PRESS CONFERENCE.   Other people have said it better, but lest I not blog anything in the enxt couple days, here it is:  I thought he did a passable job.  I caught the first third or so of the "speech" but missed the rest.  But I did catch the Q&A session.  I think he flubbed some questions--most notably the "mistake" and "apology" ones.  But i think he came across as sincere and definitely resolute in his beliefs and convictions re: the War, which I think will help him.   SIDENOTE:  Don't these 9/11 hearings do a fairly solid job of reinforcing the Bush notion of preemption as a necessary strategy?

       REHNQUIST HAILS ROGER TANEY.   urlLink Rehnquist hails jurist of Civil War era.     Chief Justice Rehnquist, known for his conservative views, briefly mentioned Dred Scott in a speech that mainly recognized Taney's advocacy of states' rights.   "Taney's long and otherwise admirable career is unfortunately marred by his opinion in the ill-starred Dred Scott case," Chief Justice Rehnquist said.   "Because of his role in the Dred Scott case, history has judged Taney harshly," Chief Justice Rehnquist said. "I want to be careful in — not in saying that our ideas are wrong, but saying that people in the past should necessarily have followed them."   Chief Justice Rehnquist was more critical of Taney in his 1987 book, "The Supreme Court: How it Was, How it Is," in which he called the Dred Scott decision "inexcusable."    I have both Rehnquist's history of the Supreme Court as well as Ferhenbacher's book on the Dred Scott decision.  I am looking forward to getting to both sometime before I die.

       PERSONAL JESUS. Interesting piece in Slate on the    urlLink many faces of Jesus  currently vying for some attention these days. The different "types" of Jesus noted in the article:  Manly Jesus (Warrior Jesus) Rocky Jesus (This is Mel Gibson's Jesus) Historical Jesus Blue-State Jesus  On BSJ:   In his recent book American Jesus, Stephen Prothero shows how early 20th-century proponents of a masculine Jesus were reacting to the feminine, Queer Eye for the Christ Guy portraits of Jesus that were popular in the 19th century. Prothero points to the absurdly womanish, wide-hipped Jesus of El Señor, Andando Sobre el Mar (Christ Walking on the Sea) as perhaps the best example. In the 21st century, feminine Jesus lives on as the ultimate sensitive man. South Park mocks this Jesus: Its Christ hosts a Donahue-style talk show called Jesus and Pals.   This is Blue-State Jesus, a pacifist Democrat who drives a hybrid vehicle while advising people to cheerfully render their taxes unto Caesar. Blue-State Jesus is an antiauthoritarian hippie who judges not lest he be judged. ("Following a set of rules doesn't make us the Father's children," grooved one 1960s San Francisco Bay Area group cited by Prothero. "It's digging on the relationship with Him.") A few years back, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals launched a Blue-State Jesus campaign when they tried to convince Americans that the Lamb of God didn't eat meat. Blue-State Jesus might be black or gay. He dislikes organized religion. He's more economic radical than sexual conservative. Sure, he opposed divorce and adultery, but didn't he save an adulteress from a stoning? Blue-State Jesus was the driving force behind abolitionism and the civil rights movement but not the pro-life or temperance movements. Heck, he's Party Jesus—he turns water into wine just to keep the night rockin'.   I still think that BSJ=Buddy Christ=Eddie Murphy from "Holy Man"

       KERRY'S TAX PLAN.  I think the title fairly sums up the article:  urlLink Kerry Taxes Will Sock It To Middle Class Families . I am a little confused how Stephen Moore can reach the conclusions he does since Kerry hasn't really ARTICULATED his plan yet (if he in fact has done so, then I just haven't seen it and am really stupid for it). Moore seems to rely on past Kerry votes to determine what the current Kerry plan will be.  While Moore does seem to rely on either statements or press releases from the Kerry camp, Moore doesn't link them so one can't be sure if the conclusions drawn by Moore are accurate or justified.  Assuming though that all this IS from a stated Kerry plan (something more specific than campaign speeched), Moore's figures note a rise in the 40%, 25%, and 10% tax brackets.  But not the 15% bracket (which the wife and I currently occupy)--presumably this is the "middle class tax cut" that Kerry would retain.   Granted, I ain't voting for Kerry (especially after computing what our refund will be this year--I.E. a LOT larger than last year), but I don't think this article does the best job of refuting Kerry's proposed tax plan.  Of course, this is all moot depending on what Kerry's ACTUAL plan has to say.

       HUH?   urlLink Jewish Group: Mormons Still Baptize Dead    SALT LAKE CITY - Researchers say that Mormons have continued to posthumously baptize Jewish Holocaust victims into their faith despite a promise to discontinue the practice.  ...  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has long collected names from government documents and other records worldwide for posthumous baptisms. Church members stand in to be baptized in the names of the deceased non-Mormons, a ritual the church says is required for them to reach heaven.   The practice is primarily intended to give salvation to the ancestors of Mormons, but many others are included, since the church believes that individuals' ability to choose a religion continues beyond the grave. Non-Mormon faiths have objected to the baptisms.    In all honesty, what is the exact problem with this? Aside from it sounding a tad goofy?   "It's ridiculous for people to pretend they have the key to heaven," said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean and founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. "And even if they say they want to do somebody a favor ... it's not a symbol of love. It's a symbol of arrogance."   About as ridiculous and arrogant as believing one's group to be God's chosen people, eh? Heh.

In the next breath, however, the White House hopeful caught himself and quickly changed direction. 'Well, let me ... change the term 'legitimate.' It belongs to a voice � because he has clearly taken on a far more radical tone in recent days and aligned himself with both Hamas and Hezbollah, which is a sort of terrorist alignment.'"

       FINE REVIEW OF  HELLBOY    I went and saw  urlLink Hellboy  tonight as a reward for getting through another round of Moot Court.  I enjoyed it.  I must echo Jonathan Last's comments here:  Played with quiet, suffering genius by Ron Perlman, Hellboy is given more life on screen than any superhero in recent memory. Perlman's performance is really quite exceptional: Doing a slow burn he serves as his own straight man. There is something hysterically funny and genuinely touching about watching a gigantic, red, horned demon lugging his frame across the screen with petulance and self-pity, staring heavenward when confronted with a monster and muttering, in a deep, put-upon voice, "Aww, crap."   Perlman was excellent and despite the all the makeup and special effects, he really did an excellent job bringing this character to "life."  Oh, the review also rips on  The Punisher .

       MOOT COURT COMPETITION UPDATE.   Well, took part in the Moot Court semi-finals today.  I thought I did markedly better than my opponent in my first round, but the judges laid most of their comments on me.  The most consistent criticism I get these days is that I speak too quickly.  Every judge has thus far admitted I have excellent speakings skills and a great presence up there, but I just talk a little too quickly.  I think this springs from the fact that I know what I'm talking about and want to get as much out there.  I've tried really hard to slow down...but doing so makes me sound retarded.   Also I think the fact that I speak quickly is that my Petitioner's argument simply has MORE information in it and I want to be able to get my points out there despite being peppered with questions (granted, the benches today were fairly "cold")  My second round went much better, as Respondent, I have more time (10 min v 8 min) and less information to get through and it's also easier to make it a more "impassioned" argument on Respondent's side.  But yeah, my second round argument went very well, the judges even set me up with such an easy softball I couldn't help making a joke out of it that actually got a laugh out of the justices.  Will my second round be sufficient to offset my perceived poor 1st round showing and help me make the team? (the top 16 of 32 make the team with 2 alternates)  Perhaps.  Though I think it's pretty certain I will not be among the top four who will go on to determine who the "Top Oralist" of the competition is.

       PEGGY NOONAN:  In today's  urlLink OpinionJournal :  The four civilians were not the only Americans who died in Iraq yesterday. We lost five soldiers in a roadside bombing. The statements of American officials in Iraq were appropriate: This stops nothing, the terrorists will not win. A State Department spokesman said the contractors "were trying to make a difference and to help others." Indeed they were. There are many such in Iraq. They are risking their lives for many reasons, including improving the prospects for health and safety of 12-year-old boys like the one quoted by Reuters who witnessed the actions of his elders after the attack on the civilians. "I am happy to see this," he said. It is hard not to hate the teenagers and young men who celebrated under the bridge where they hanged the charred bodies. They are human expressions of nihilism. They take pleasure in evil, and they were not shy to show it. They are arrogant. They think barbarity is their right.   If this time, in this incident, these young men are left unchecked, their ways and attitudes, their assumptions and method of operating will only be encouraged, and spread. So we had better check them.  ...  We know what the men and boys who did the atrocity of Fallujah look like; they posed for the cameras. We know exactly what they did--again, the cameras. We know they massed on a bridge and raised their guns triumphantly. It's all there on film. It would be good not only for elemental justice but for Iraq and its future if a large force of coalition troops led by U.S. Marines would go into Fallujah, find the young men, arrest them or kill them, and, to make sure the point isn't lost on them, blow up the bridge.   Indeed.

      Prof. Bainbridge has  urlLink some problems  with the WWII memorial. That's fine, it's his right.  But in a response to those problems, he writes:   The WWII Generation deserves a memorial. No dispute about that. (Although I suspect the veterans of 1776 and 1861 would have a few words to say about this greatest generation stuff.)    I have a minor problem with this statement.  For while both generations certainly would object to the label of "Greatest" being applied solely to the WWII generation, I don’t think either the Revolutionary Generation or the Civil War Generation have as strong a claim to the title for the key fact that opinion was far more divided among them than it was among the WWII generation.  Not to minimize the accomplishment of either generation—-but when you have sizeable portions of the populace (in the form of Loyalists or Confederates/Copperheads) working expressly AGAINST what made that generation “great” (establishing the Union/preserving it)—it makes it harder for the label to apply.  As I said, it's ultimately a minor point, but I felt like blogging about it. So there.

      Cobb  urlLink takes issue  with Victor Davis Hanson and his recent book "Mexifornia." Cobb writes:   Victor Davis Hanson asserts in a jumble of historical facts that multiculturalists are responsible for spreading a fog of victimology which has poisoned the American spirit and resolve. Ultimately he places blame at the foot of Marxism, which is a good thing because there is much to multiculturalism he refuses to understand in his current indictment. What he refuses to see is the extent to which multiculturalism is not internationalist politics but an expression of the desires of non-whites to have cultural influence and economic power in America.   I don't know if Hanson is the main exponent of this false nexus and have not read Mexifornia, but many who quote from it suggest a panicky loss of control and understanding of how America is changing. I find it difficult to believe that blacks, latins and asians are widely persuaded by Left academics' Marxist agenda, and I think that anyone credulous enough to take that as gospel is letting prejudice work. The Culture Wars are over, but this rearguard action is spoiling for a new fight.   My response (posted on his site and reprinted below with some minor pronoun changes):  I think he's being unduly hard on a book he admits to having not read.  The book is most assuredly NOT the "nativist" treatise he thinks.  Hanson makes this clear early in his close person relations with myriad of immigrants (both "good" and "bad").    No, he takes both the left to task for the racial hucksters that promote a "multicultural" experience that works fairly hard to promote a separatist mindset keeping the "multi-" (insofar as it includes AMERICAN culture) out of it.    Similarly, he takes the right to task for its refusal to admit that immigrants DO add a great deal to the economy/nation and the notion (among the anti-immigrant right) that you can simply "close off" the border is both naive and quite harmful. Further, the right's tendency to treat immigrants (illegals and others) as invisible citizens leads to a large transitory population of young men with no real attachment to America.  The problem on the left is the willful rejection of assimilation as a societal good and on the right the negligent refusal to accpet immigration as a net good to society.  People see "Mexifornia" and go ape-shyte about it when they're better served by reading the book. Depending on your political persuasion, about 50% of the book will piss you off. Which is why it's such a good & honest book.

      Apparently, a record number  urlLink of Germans were booked for offensive gestures  last year.   Germans are rude and getting ruder, according to new statistics which showed a record 164,848 of them were booked last year for insulting each other.   In hard times, with welfare cuts impacting across society and companies going bust at record rates, an ordered-but-rude society is getting nastier. In 1990 there were fewer than 80,000 prosecutions for insulting people - this year some estimate it may top out at more than 200,000.   "Welcome in the republic of insults," said Der Spiegel, the premier news magazine in its latest issue hitting newspaper stands today.   Most of last year’s offences were gestures that are carefully defined in a catalogue kept by public prosecutors.   They include tapping the forehead with an index finger, which relays the message "you’re crazy", forming an "O" with the index finger and thumb to signify a part of the anatomy and United States -inspired use of the middle finger.   Verbal insults listed by prosecutors include "stupid cow," "pig-dog" and "riff-raff".    People get prosecuted for such weak-ass insults as THESE? My god.   Frankfurt prosecutor Dieter Kellermann said the insults alone don’t tell the whole story.   "It starts off with a bit of sign language and suddenly you’re involved in grievous bodily harm," he said.   Left unchecked, you've got the Fourth Reich.

      PJ O'Rourke contemplates the effects (good, bad, and funny) of the US just  urlLink taking our ball and going home .  The benefits will be immediate. We can cut $300 billion from our defense budget. This will be almost enough to pay for the aging baby boomers' prescription drug benefits, which can now include Levitra, Botox and medicinal cannabis.  America will enjoy cleaner air and less traffic congestion as oil goes to $200 a barrel due to chaos in the Middle East. A U.S. withdrawal from the Middle East will cause chaos, of course. Then again, a U.S. intervention in the Middle East has caused chaos already. And, during those periods of history when the U.S. was neither intervening in nor withdrawing from the Middle East, there was . . . chaos. The situation is akin to the famous complaint women have against men: failure to acknowledge that not every problem can be fixed. Sometimes the best thing is just a little sympathy. America had everyone's sympathy after the World Trade towers were attacked. We can get that sympathy back if we limit our foreign policy objectives to whining.  One thing to whine about will be the fate of Israel. Without American safeguards that nation is certain to be militarily attacked. To judge by previous Israeli wars, in 1948, 1956, 1967, 1973 and 1982, the result will be serious headaches for Israelis as the Knesset furiously debates the status of Jewish settlements outside Damascus and on the west bank of the Euphrates.

       urlLink Paul over at Wizbang  doesn't think much of the NYT's Dan Okrent's "apology" for its WMD reporting in the lead up to the war.   The folks at the New York Times have been stricken by selective amnesia. Whether Saddam had WMD was never up for debate. He not only had them but he used them to kill tens of thousands of his own people. (Why does that need to be repeated at this point?)  Saddam's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction was well documented by the United Nations. Assuming the tooth fairy did not come and take them, something happened to them. At this stage we don't know what was done with them. Saddam himself told various stories of their status from claiming they were all destroyed to claiming he had them pointed at Israel.   Much has been made over the fact we have not found them.  It is equally fair to say we have found no evidence Saddam destroyed them.  So while the present status up the weapons is unknown to the Western world, the fact they existed is not debatable.   I won't go so far as Paul does in proclaiming the NYT as being increasingly irrelevant, but its agenda is certainly more apparent. Which is still relevant (and all the funnier)

       urlLink Bendomenech.com: Portrait of a Memorial as a Dog Park  There's nothing awesome - in the proper meaning of the word - about this monument. There's no stories of victories won or cities liberated or captives freed. It's essentially a ring of blocked out wreath-laden stones with "Rhode Island" and other state names written on them. For a moment, I got the distinct feeling that I'd stumbled on an ALEC meeting.  There's no sense of "this is why we fight." There's no sense in "we shall never surrender." There's no sense of "this was our finest hour." There's only the feeling of vague unease, as if you're willing yourself to be moved by something that just ... doesn't.   The whole thing could just as easily be an oval effigy dedicated to the Triumphant Return of the Mighty Postmoderns. It is clumsy and bureaucratic. It has no classic line or form. It is as graceless and hollow as the lobby of a modern governmental building.  I don't know if I agree, especially since I have been to the memorial--but I am leaning away from such a scathing indictment of it.

      I generally like  urlLink Andrew Sullivan .  When he is on his game, hes an exceptional writer.  He can pull a Chesterton quote out of thin air and make it work and I like that.  However, he is also one of the most maddeningly  urlLink mercurial   (see definition #4) commentators out there when it comes to the war.  He has an impressively annoying tendency to swing more than a pendulum re: his feelings and opinions on the war, its conduct, its strategy, and its outcome. The shrillness of his rhetoric can crack crystal.   While Sullivan himself admits that his blog is more of a "thought in process" type of endeavor that would allow for some reexamination of one's assumption--he has nevertheless jumped the shark when it comes to viewing the war's events even remotely consistently.  So how does this make him Horace Greeley?  Well, Greeley was the staunch abolitionist editor of the New York Tribune during the Civil War.  He was an ardent Lincoln supporter early on as Lincoln was the symbol of the fight against secession and, more importantly, slavery.  My instincts tell me Greeley would have preferred John C. Fremont since he was less willing to negotiate on the slave issue--but that's just my gut (I've not delved too deeply into the matter to say for certain).    But what made Greeley such an interesting character aside from his unwavering desire to end slavery was his complete lack of consistency when it came to reporting on the war--which in hindsight makes him look all the more amusing.  A very brief summation of the whole shebang:   Post-Fort Sumter? On to Richmond!  Defeat at First Bull Run? What incompetence have we unleashed?!  Gettysburg and Vicksburg? Victory is at hand!  The Grinding Months of 1864?  What butchery! Can we trust Lincoln to lead us to victory? Fall of Atlanta to Appomattox? Hurrah!  So what I've attempted to do is chronicle some of the more impressive lurches from steel-eyed determination (the "this is but a bump in the road and we shall prevail" ) to near unhinged defeatism (the "too few troops! too many Mahdi! we must prevail but I just don't know if we CAN!") that Sullivan has written over the past few months.  While doing this I've noticed that Andrew's writing is dictated almost exclusively by events on the ground--in that, if the media coverage of the day isn't blaring war news, Sullivan isn't writing about it. Now, that's par for the course for most bloggers since we rarely MAKE news (Daily Kos and Micah Wright notwithstanding).  And Sullivan is certainly entitled to change his mind.  But it is still fairly interesting to take notice of. Whether that impacts his writing is a fair question I will not attempt to answer.   Rather than try to categorize them, I will simply post selections (with links to posts) in reverse chronological order with highlighted portions of what I think are the more "colorful" examples of rhetoric. You'll find there's something of an ebb and flow to it as time goes on. NOTE: My comments get progressively snarkier as the post goes on--I tried to combat that, but it did get kind of annoying seeing the tone of these posts swing back and forth so much--forgive me)  And as you're reading: consider this:   Oct 20-- urlLink THE DEMS AND IRAQ      ...It is relatively easy to criticize the Iraq war, the intelligence behind it, and the post-war reconstruction. It's another thing to say what you would have done instead. Memories are astonishingly short...     So here goes:  May 19, 2004-- urlLink BUSH'S FAILURE    : All the president says is a broad and crude reiteration of valid but superfluous boilerplate.  This is not war-leadership; it's the abdication of war-leadership ... It's long past time that people can be asked simply to trust the president. After the WMD intelligence debacle and the Abu Ghraib disgrace,  he has run out of that capital . He has to tell us how we will win, what we are doing, how it all holds together,  why the infrastructure repair is still in disarray , and how a political solution is possible.  I'm not sure any more that this president has the skills or competence to pull it off.  But I am sure that he has very little time to persuade us he can.  May 12-- urlLink HOW DUMB IS AL QAEDA?     They think they terrify us by this?  The gang-murder of an unarmed, innocent civilian? And they think that it will add to the shame of Abu Ghraib, demoralize Americans still further, and prompt a withdrawal?  In fact, of course, the Berg beheading does a grim but salutary service.  In the midst of our own deserved self-criticism, we are suddenly reminded of the larger stakes, the wider war, why we are in Iraq in the first place .  May 10-- urlLink THE CHASTENING    The question I have asked myself in the wake of Abu Ghraib is simply the following:  if I knew before the war what I know now, would I still have supported it? I cannot deny that the terrible mismanagement of the post-war - something that no reasonable person can now ignore - has, perhaps fatally, wrecked the mission.  But does it make the case for war in retrospect invalid? My tentative answer - and this is a blog, written day by day and hour by hour, not a carefully collected summary of my views - is  yes, I still would have supported the war. But only just. And whether the "just" turns into a "no" depends on how we deal with the huge challenge now in front of us.   May 10-- urlLink THE CASE STANDS - JUST  (compare this with his earlier discussions of the "imminence" of the threat of Saddam from Oct-Nov of 2003)   The United States made its case before the entire world on the basis of actual stockpiles of dangerous weaponry. No such stockpiles existed.  Yes, the infrastructure was there, the intent was there, the potential was there - all good cause for concern.  Yes, the alternative of maintaining porous sanctions - a regime that both impoverished and punished the Iraqi people while empowering and enriching Saddam and his U.N. allies - was awful. But the case the U.S. actually made has been disproved. There is no getting around that. ...  Abu Ghraib...has turned the image of this war into the war that the America-hating left always said it was: a brutal, imperialist, racist occupation, designed to humiliate another culture. Abu Ghraib is Noam Chomsky's narrative turned into images more stunning, more damaging, more powerful than a million polemics from Ted Rall or Susan Sontag. It is Osama's dream propaganda coup.  It is Chirac's fantasy of vindication. It is Tony Blair's nightmare. And, whether they are directly responsible or not,  the people who ran this war are answerable to America, to America's allies, to Iraq, for the astonishing setback we have now encountered on their watch .   May 10-- urlLink THE INEXCUSABLE     The one anti-war argument that, in retrospect, I did not take seriously enough was a simple one. It was that this war was noble and defensible but that this administration was simply too incompetent and arrogant to carry it out effectively. I dismissed this as facile Bush-bashing at the time. I was wrong.  But to have allowed the situation to slide into where we now are, to have a military so poorly managed and under-staffed that what we have seen out of Abu Ghraib was either the result of a) chaos, b) policy or c) some awful combination of the two, is inexcusable. It is a betrayal of all those soldiers who have done amazing work, who are genuine heroes, of all those Iraqis who have risked their lives for our and their future, of ordinary Americans who trusted their president and defense secretary to get this right.  To have humiliated the United States by presenting false and misleading intelligence and then to have allowed something like Abu Ghraib to happen - after a year of other, compounded errors - is unforgivable.   May 10-- urlLink WINNING THE WAR    Abu Ghraib is not the real meaning of America. And we now have to show it - in abundance. That is the opportunity this calamity has opened up. And then, when November comes around, we have to decide whether this president is now a liability in the war on terror or the asset he once was.  How he reacts to this crisis - whether he is even in touch enough to recognize it as a crisis - should determine how the country votes this fall. He and his team have failed us profoundly. He has a few months to show he can yet succeed.   May 9-- urlLink READ AND WEEP    The photos we have seen are, apparently, benign compared to what we have not yet seen. I am sorry I cannot be more upbeat. But nothing that the enemy could dream up could have done us more harm in the eyes of the world than what some in U.S. uniform have done to the United States' credibility and honor.... But the damage is immeasurable ; and, ultimately, the president must take responsibility. ... Maybe the rest of the country won't react the same way.  Or maybe there will be a time-lag in which the country as a whole realizes it has lost confidence in this administration as profoundly as Washington now has .   May 8-- urlLink ELECTIONS SOON    Kagan and Kristol endorse Iraqi elections by September 30. It's an idea worth trying. I think they're right that  we are at a tipping point at which support for the war at home will plummet unless we change direction fast .  May 6-- urlLink BUSH JOB APPROVAL AT 47 PERCENT  (contrast with his earlier glowing praise of Rumsfeld--now Rummy is an out of touch boob)   I wonder if Abu Ghraib isn't a turning point. I was glad the president went on Arab television to explain. I'm befuddled why he cannot simply apologize. Rumsfeld's blithe assertion that he hadn't even bothered to read the full Taguba report before a major press conference also cannot quite dislodge itself from my consciousness.  I don't think Rummy gets it.   May 5-- urlLink GO TO ABU GHRAIB    It seems to me that some kind of reckoning has to be made by the president himself. No one below him can have the impact of a presidential statement of apology to the Iraqi and American people. Bush should give one. He should show true responsibility and remorse, which I have no doubt he feels. I can think of no better way than to go to Abu Ghraib itself, to witness the place where these abuses occurred and swear that the culprits will be punished and that it will not happen again. It would be a huge gesture.  But frankly there is something tawdry about a president at a time like this campaigning in the Midwest in a bus. His entire war's rationale has been called into question. The integrity of the United States has been indelibly harmed on his watch. He must account for it. Soon. And why not in Iraq?   May 4-- urlLink SEX AND HUMILIATION    I am in no way attempting to minimize the horror of what appears to have gone on in Abu Ghraib prison under U.S. command.  But it's worth realizing that the nakedness and the sexual humiliation might be far more potent in a sexist, homophobic and patriarchal culture than in less sexually repressed societies .  May 3-- urlLink WHAT THE FALLUJAH?     All I can honestly say is that I have no clue what is going on in Fallujah, the critical battle of the war in Iraq.  The obvious interpretation is that the Bush White House, under political pressure at home, has decided to all-but surrender the city to the enemy .  ...  I think the obvious answer to the question as to what is happening in Fallujah is that the White House doesn't have a clue.  In a critical battle, we have made sure that the enemy understands we can have overwhelming military power and not be willing to use it; we have appointed a new commander who hasn't even been vetted; and people on the ground are making up policy that has far-reaching political and military implications, while the White House has to adjust.  The only word for this is incompetence and chaos.    April 30-- urlLink THE RISK IN FALLUJA  (this is more an example of Sullivan's tendency swing within the same post--but contrast the general sentiment against overwhelming force with the April 22 post following the murder of the 4 US contractors)   I can't be the only one troubled by the apparent decision to hand over the pacification of Falluja to some kind of Sunni/Iraqi force. Rumsfeld suggests that this is a recommendation from the Marines on the ground. You can certainly see why an effective Iraqi attempt to destroy the Baathist and Islamist forces in Falluja would be a good thing. But how realistic is that? And what does this sign of our retreat say to the rest of the population?   Don't get me wrong. I'm aware that we have to strike a balance here - between quelling unrest and provoking more of it.  But if we had the chance to eradicate a whole swathe of Baathist/Islamist terrorists and walked away, then it would amount to a huge miscalculation. In my lower moments, it makes me worry if the Bush administration has begun to abandon Iraq to internal chaos.  I cannot believe they would do that. But this Falluja reversal is mystifying, to say the least.  April 22-- urlLink BARBARISM IN BASRA  (this post nicely illustrates the general lack of focus by Sullivan on the issue--if he assumes that such barbaric acts will occur given the nature of this war and the enemy--then he can't be nearly as critical of the war effort/planning when such events do occur)  To some, I suppose, the hideous slaughter of so many innocents in suicide bombings in southern Iraq is another reason to worry that the occupation is doomed. I have a different response. It reminds me why we are in this war in the first place. It reminds me of the nihilist, fascist forces that killed thousands in New York and Bali and Madrid. ...  We have the difficult task of fighting them, while protecting innocents in a war where the enemy deliberately and cynically conflates the two. That isn't easy anywhere - but better to have drawn these elements out and to fight them in a struggle for Arab and Muslim democracy than to play constant, fitful defense at home .  April 20-- urlLink BUSH GAINS  (more just Sullivan being a slave to polls and note that a mere month ago--"It's the war, stupid" has become "Bush's Failure")   How to account for president Bush's resilient polling numbers?  It's the war, stupid. And guess what? All of you who thought that press conference was a disaster were, ahem, WRONG. Whatever the headlines, the domination of the debate by national security can only benefit the president unless Kerry can out-hawk him.  Kerry's "Sister Souljah" moment must come when he denounces the anti-war left. Without that moment, he'll lose.  April 15-- urlLink SADR CAPITULATES  (contrast this with the April 30 post questioning the logic of pacifying Fallujah with the help of Shi'ia and also the apparent contradiction between that post and this one's contention re: the "ceding of control")   I'm unnerved by the presence of Iranians helping to broker some kind of deal with al Sadr, but heartened by the fact that the extremist revolt in Fallujah seems to have been quelled - largely by Marine force and by moderate Shiite realism. ... It seems clear to me that indigenous forces have to construct the new government. It is not a loss for the U.S. to cede control in this way. It is what we are looking for.   April 14-- urlLink UPDATE  (His reaction to Bush's press conference--contrast with his later denunciations of Bush's failure to apologize for Abu Ghraib.  Has Bush's policy deteriorated that much within a month or is it more just Sullivan reacting to bad news in a particularly shrill manner?)   I've just watched the press conference later on C-SPAN. Not only was the transcript encouraging.  I found the president clear, forceful, impassioned, determined, real.  This was not an average performance.  I found it Bush at his best. He needs to do it more.   April 14-- urlLink AND MORE  (Al Jazeera propaganda = "they lose"; Big Media propaganda = "Bush loses")--the post is re: the spate of hostage videos released at the time   But I am saying that being able to withstand this attempted blackmail - and not succumb to media hype - will prevent further such kidnappings in the future. Maybe, in fact, al Jazeera has unwittingly helped us here. By  broadcasting so much obvious propaganda on a daily basis, we are now inured to it, unshocked. Which means they lose.    April 13-- urlLink BUSH'S RESPONSIBILITY  ("never enough troops" followed 2 days later by "Fallujah has been quelled" as well as the concession that more troops might not have actually solved any of the problems Sullivan sees--also note that a mere 3 days prior Sullivan promises to try to be more "positive re: his coverage of the war)   It's worth saying here what we now know the president got wrong - badly wrong. There were never enough troops to occupy Iraq.  The war-plan might have been brilliant, but the post-war plan has obviously been a failure.  We needed more force and we needed more money sooner. The president has no excuses for not adjusting more quickly to this fact: he was told beforehand; he was told afterward;  but he and the Defense Secretary were too pig-headed to change course . I still favor the war;  but I cannot excuse the lapses and failures of the administration in the post-war .   ...  Yes, balancing keeping order and winning hearts and minds is not an easy operation to pull off.  But with the troop levels we maintained - especially given the limited international support -  we made things far harder than they might have been, and our beleaguered troops are dealing with the aftermath . We can still win this. We must still win this.  But the president is in part responsible for making it even harder than it might have been.   April 10-- urlLink THE SILVER LINING  (How was the post war planning so much a failure if the power vacuum was unavoidable)   I'm going to be writing more about the positive possibilities that are now opening up in Iraq.  My own view is that the violence is an inevitable consequence of the various factions in Iraq feeling their way toward filling the power vacuum. This is not only unavoidable; it can be revealing .  April 9-- urlLink THE PASSION OF IRAQ  (While Sullivan does not expect Iraq to turn around overnight--apparently one month is sufficient to warrant the change in tone from this post to the ones in May--and while he exhorts us to "keep our nerve" he seems to be rapidly losing his)   Iraq has been a free country for a single year after decades of fascism, mass murder, communal paranoia, hysteria, random violence, and economic collapse.  Did we expect the place to become Toledo overnight? The closer we get to transferring power, the more the extremist factions need to prevent a peaceful transition and establish their own power bases for the next phase.  The closer we get to a self-governing Arab state, the more terrified Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, Hamas and the rest will be that their alternatives - theocratic fascism and medieval economics - will look pathetic in comparison. There are millions of people in Iraq who need us now more than ever. Their future and our future are entwined. Which is why we have to keep our nerve, put down these insurrections with focussed ferocity, and move relentlessly toward self-rule. It may be dark this Friday, but Christians are told that a new day will dawn. Not in three days. But in time. If we keep our nerve.  April 8-- urlLink THE WAR INTENSIFIES  (The certitude that more troops are needs expressed later is far less apparent here. Also note the concession that Sunni holdouts will "always be trouble")    The war to depose Saddam, it now seems, has unfolded slowly. The sudden quick victory was followed by a low-intensity war against the remnants of the Saddam regime and elements among the displaced Sunni miniority.  Then there was something of a lull - months when the U.S. casualty rate declined and progress seemed to be made. Then the Shiites began resisting the terms of the handover, some Sunnis in Fallujah tried a Mogadishu, and the most radical Shiites, under al Sadr, made their move ...  The Sadrists must be confronted and as effectively as possible. If that means more troops, send them. If that means more firepower, get it.  In some ways,  it seems clear to me that the Sunni hold-outs and the Sadrists were always going to be trouble.  Better that they play their card now than after the handover of sovereignty.   April 8-- urlLink THE RISK  (again, this post says more about Sullivan's need to be reassured he made the right decision ot back the war than any failings of policy)   This war is for the future against the past, for representative government against a vicious theocratic dictatorship from the Leninist vanguards of the Sadrists. The president needs to tell the people this. His failure to communicate what is actually going on, why we're there, what we're doing, and what the stakes are is the prime current fault of the administration.  We need a real speech and a thorough explanation of what is going on. We need an honest, candid, clear war-president. Where is he?   April 7-- urlLink THE IRAQ CRISIS  ("I am, but I am not")   I feel it's necessary for me to write something about what's going on in Iraq but this is also one of those moments when the reality is so opaque and events so fluid that it's hard to know what to say. I'm not ducking this.  It looks both terrible and also an opportunity. Better these tnesions flare now than later. But the flaring could also become a wildfire.   April 6-- urlLink THE LESSON FROM SPAIN  (Sadr's quote makes Sullivan's wobbling all the more troubling)   Here's a quote from a Sadr relative that speaks volumes:  "We may be unable to drive the Americans out of Iraq. But we can drive George W. Bush out of the White House."  The violence in Iraq is designed to exert pressure indirectly by leveraging opposition to the war in the U.S. and Britain. The sadr-masochists know they cannot overwhelm the coalition militarily, so they need to destroy its morale at home, as well as create constant instability in Iraq.  One obvious point: this uprising isn't over and it's having its effect.    April 6-- urlLink GET SADR  (Note the dismissal of the anti-war spin with Sullivan's essential adoption of the meme later on)    The battle for Sadr City appears to be over. If this report is to be believed, it was relatively easy.  .... The optimist in me hopes that this confrontation - threatening for months - can be resolved effectively before June 30. The pessimist in me worries about the propaganda value in this kind of unrest in deterring investment, polarizing ethnicities and sects, and making democracy even harder.  If you want to see how the anti-war crowd will spin this, check out the headline in the Guardian today: "On the Brink of Anarchy." They wish. I find no fault in the president's strong response.  But he must understand that the battle he is now fighting in Iraq is not a diversion from this election.  April 5-- urlLink IS IT GETTING WORSE    This just in from the HealingIraq blogger, whose site is now down because Glenn just linked. I'm reposting Glenn's excerpt, because it strikes me as a really big deal.  We could be losing the ball-game right now, guys....This sounds like civil war to me.   April 5-- urlLink GRIM NEWS IN IRAQ  (Contrast the assertion that we KNEW Sunni elements would resist reconstruction with the assertion that the planning for it is wholly inadequate--Sullivan sets a standard no war plan could meet--Sullivan repeats the "more troops" line but then acknowledges it might not be the best idea)    With three months to go before sovereignty is handed over to a provisional government, there are some nightmarish portents. We knew that elements in the Sunni minority would resist the reconstruction of Iraq into a representative polity; now we have the extremists among the Shiites, under Moktada al Sadr, unleashing Shiite anger against the occupation.  You have to ask yourself: if this is the state of affairs now, what will happen to civil order when the U.S. military takes an even more passive role after June 30?... More and more, it seems hard to avoid inferring that we made one huge mistake: not in liberating Iraq, but in attempting to occupy it with relatively few troops ...From this distance, it's not clear what our response to all this should be: a strong show of force; an attempt to broker a firmer deal for handover with the establishment Shiites; more troops; or all of the above.  But it seems to me undeniable that events may be spinning out of control .   April 5-- urlLink ON THE OTHER HAND  (As events can go forward and backward at once, so can Andrew)   It's hard not to be cheered by stories like this appearing last Thursday in the Guardian. The son of Gadhafi is urging more democratization in the Arab world. Money quote from Seif al-Islam Gadhafi: "Instead of shouting and criticizing the American initiative, you have to bring democracy to your countries, and then there will be no need to fear America or your people. The Arabs should either change or change will be imposed on them from outside." Amen.  Of course, it's perfectly possible that both this story and the Burns one represent something true. Events can go forward and backward at once .  April 1-- urlLink THE MOGADISHU MOMENT  (Andrew notes the next two or three YEARS could be brutal--he himself barely lasted a month.)   The appalling brutality in the Sunni Triangle yesterday was designed to have one simple effect: to encourage the West to abandon Iraq to the very people who perpetrated this atrocity. The methods are the same as Somalia. The response will be different .... All the more reason to maintain the deadline for the transition to self-rule, and to keep a close military and police alliance with the incoming government.  I'm still an optimist - in the medium term. But the next two or three years could be brutal. We just got a taste of how brutal they could be.    March 30-- urlLink ROSENBAUM ON FIRE  (Apparently the Admin has the clarity to name the real evil in our day and to fight it but Andrew requires MORE clarity on what exactly we're fighting for...)   Yes, it is possible to be dismayed, betrayed and depressed by this administration's political catering to bigotry. But it is just as possible to be grateful that it had the balls to liberate two countries from unspeakable horror and to have had the clarity to name the real evil in our day for what it is. And to fight it.   March 29-- urlLink THE CLARKE TEMPEST     But what matters now in a political year is how the Bushies responded afterwards; and, to my mind, they did about as good a job as possible.  The way some people are now talking, you'd think the White House hadn't targeted Afghanistan and al Qaeda before Saddam.   But they went to al Qaeda's base first, taking the war to the enemy patiently and determinedly - with enormous success first against the Taliban and then against Saddam. Millions are now liberated from unspeakable tyranny; reform is afoot in the Middle East; al Qaeda has been seriously wounded. Not a bad start   March 16-- urlLink DENIAL IS NOT AN OPTION  (this is the "steely resolve" Andrew that emerges less often lately)    But it will perhaps take more atrocities for Europeans to acknowledge something that they have proudly built is under threat. History has not ended. Islamism does not seek to integrate itself into Europe. It seeks the abolition of Europe as a democratic, peaceful, pluralist place.  And America must understand that this war cannot be lost in Europe either. We need a real and vigorous effort to reunite Europe and the U.S. against this danger. Alas, we just lost one leader, Jose Maria Aznar, who understood that need, and Blair may be next.  March 15-- urlLink THE E.U. VOWS SURRENDER  (Al Qaeda won in Spain and is apparently winning in The Daily Dish)   Al Qaeda has been seriously weakened since 9/11, thanks almost entirely to those countries, especially the U.S., that chose to confront it. But it seems clear to me that the trend in Europe is now either appeasement of terror or active alliance with it.  It is hard to view the results in Spain as anything but a choice between Bush and al Qaeda. Al Qaeda won .   March 8-- urlLink SISTANI SHIFTS  (that which is "politics" one week is a failure of post war planning the next)    The violence in Iraq - even the horrifying sectarian mass murders last week - have failed to derail the tortuous political process. That's hugely good news. It's not surprising that there should be last-minute renegotiations, brinksmanship and the like in forging a new constitution in a fissiparous country. That's called politics.  It hasn't been practised in Iraq for many, many years. Its emergence - however imperfect - is wonderfully good news. Instead of lamenting this wrangling, we should be encouraged.  What we're seeing is something you simply don't see anywhere else in the Arab-Muslim world: negotiation trumping violence. This isn't a path to democracy. In important ways, it is democracy. The first true post-war victory is ours - and, more importantly, Iraq's.   March 3-- urlLink ZARQAWI STRIKES  (we are winning, yet losing)   We know from the released memo that may or may not have been written by Islamist mass murderer, Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi, what the strategy of the enemy now is in Iraq. It is to execute coordinated mass slaughters in order to divide Sunni and Shi'a even further and so precipitate a civil war to tear Iraq apart; and at the same time to direct public hostility and blame toward the coalition forces. It's too soon to tell how successful they have been with their horrifyingly sacrilegious slaughter yesterday.  But the attacks are text-book. I persist in regarding them as indications that we are in fact slowly winning the war for a transition to democracy in Iraq, or at least a polity which is constitutional and remarkably free by Middle Eastern standards.  But it is equally hard not to be concerned at the impact such mass violence can have. After all, it was acomplished by only a handful of terrorists  Feb 25-- urlLink THE WAR AND THE CONSTITUTION    It behooves me to wrestle with a question that many of you have asked me about.  I have long been a strong supporter of this president's extraordinary leadership in the war on terror. He has made some mistakes, but I stand by his broader record entirely.    Feb 19-- urlLink BUSH AT 43 PERCENT  (Andrew's need to be led around by the nose on why we're fighting--and hence, why Bush is running)   People have registered that the WMD issue has undermined one argument for the war. But instead of acknowledging this forthrightly and making a strong case for the war's morality and the importance of Iraq's democratization, the president has fallen back on self-satisfied platitudes...There is, in short, no argument for a second term.  Instead, we're told that the re-election theme will be: I'm a strong leader in a time of change. But leading where? We don't know.  If the president wants to get re-elected, we should.  Feb 14-- urlLink READ THIS NOW  (SUMMATION: Because we are winning, violence is inevitable--but because violence is inevitable, we are losing)   I cannot verify the authenticity of the letter from al Qaeda murderer Abu Musab al-Zarkawi. But most authorities regard it as legit.  If you doubt that we have made real progress in the war on terror, if you buy the idiocy that tackling Saddam somehow made tackling al Qaeda harder, then read this document. It's alternately terrifying and deeply encouraging. We are winning this war. And only we can choose to lose it.    Feb 12-- urlLink THE CARNAGE IN IRAQ  ("Steely" Andrew reappears)   If anyone thinks this war is over, they need to get real. We need more resources in Iraq, not fewer.  We need to think of July as the beginning of our new engagement, not the end of a war and occupation. ...We have lost sight of the central issue of our time. We owe it to the dead to remember again, to keep our focus - and press on.  Feb 12-- urlLink A "JUSTIFIED MISTAKE"  (Apparently the abuses of a handful of soldiers have also sufficiently nullified any other rationale for the war Andrew might think of)   WMDs were not the only rationale given for this war before the war. The human rights issue, the immorality of continued sanctions, the necessity of finding a way to facilitate change in the region as a whole - these were all arguments made in advance (on this blog and elsewhere).  The war was a justified mistake in one respect. We overstated the WMD angle. But we under-estimated the horrors of what was going on in that country. Shouldn't that also count in the balance?   Feb 9-- urlLink BUSH's [MEET THE PRESS] INTERVIEW    But all the clips struck me as Bush as he normally is: affable, accessible, often inarticulate,  but on the basic points of the war (if nothing else) right .  FEB 9-- urlLink MY DEEPER WORRY    It's about the war. During the part of the interview when Bush could have strongly supported his nation-building in Iraq, and linked it to tackling the deeper problems that gave us 9/11, he was defensive and almost apologetic. I wonder: does he actually regret being a nation-builder?  Does he privately wish he'd never done this? We all know his position before 9/11. Nation-building was the last thing he wanted to do. Has he reverted to type? In this kind of enterprise we need conviction at the top. At least more conviction than we saw yesterday.  My prediction: another small poll tumble.    NOTE: Sullivan did very little "warblogging" during between Dec 03 and Feb 04.  Most of it was Democratic primary stuff. Not relevant for purposes here. But we rejoin Andrew in our trek back through time around the capture of Saddam.  Dec 15-- urlLink I'M STILL REELING  (notable for its content as well as its contrast with later (and earlier) posts)   It is not for us to understand fully what these people were put through. At a moment like this, when we can see fully and clearly the evil that existed for so long - evil that we in the past did our part to maintain - it is important simply to recall the dead and their loved ones. Think of every moment when some poor soul believed he was about to die, every moment spent in hellish prisons, every person tortured beyond imagining, every child dumped in a mass grave, every person of faith treated as an enemy of the state.  To watch the perpetrator of this extraordinary evil brought low - into a rat-hole in the ground - is a privilege. It happens rarely. It is a moment when some kind of cosmic justice breaks through the clouds, and all the petty wrangling and mistakes and political jockeying fall away in the face of liberation from inescapable fear and terror and brutality. It was a day of joy. Nothing remains to be said right now. Joy .  Dec 14-- urlLink IN AN IRAQI'S WORDS  (same as above)   I am so proud of the country I was born in and the country I have made my home.  I have never been prouder to be an Anglo-American, to have done in our time what so many before us have done - to broaden the possibilities of liberty, to bring hope, to restrain the violent men and evil ideologies that are each generation's responsibility. The men and women in our armed forces did the hardest work.  They deserve our immeasurable thanks. But we all played our part. By facing down the evil, the cowardly and the simply misguided, we have done a great good.  Dec 14-- urlLink WMD FOUND  (The capture of Saddam was apparently not so transformative an event for Andrew)    The capture of Saddam is, of course, a transformative event . The hole in which he was discovered - and those bedraggled, hobo-like photos - re-emphasize his humiliation, and can only discourage his erstwhile allies trying to restore his gang of thugs to power. But this is a moment not merely for jubilation. Take a moment to recall the hundreds of thousands of men, women and children murdered, tortured, or sent to certain deaths by this monster. Take a moment to consider those who also lost their lives deposing him. In the end, even Chirac and Schroder and Putin couldn't save him.  And the renewed focus on the single most important Iraqi weapon of mass destruction - Saddam himself - will help remind the world of the great, moral achievement of this war; and the unprecedented humanitarian effort that is now underway . No time for hubris.  But plenty of time to remember what this war was about; and why it is still eminently worth winning. Congratulations, Mr President and Mr Prime Minister. In the end, this war will be viewed as your greatest achievement .  Dec 8-- urlLink PRESIDENT BOTH  (The quickness and ease by which Sullivan can find fault with policy should be contrasted with the "undeniable scale" of the undertaking)   And after 9/11, a passive approach to Islamist terrorism might well have sent a signal that we were a soft target and emboldened the new fascists even more. And continuing the failed policies of the past in the Middle East would have meant another, worse 9/11 sooner rather than later. But even if you see the Bush Project as driven primarily by events, that doesn't make it any the less impressive.  The sheer scale of the undertaking is undeniable . Perhaps it takes a relatively modest man who never planned on being president to take such huge gambles on the future.  But there is also something deeply American about it - in its perhaps excessive optimism and sheer determination.   It also seems clearer, to me at least, that this president is likely to have eight years to accomplish his task . Friends in the White House have sometimes spoken to me about a "transformational" presidency. I used to inwardly wince. Now I wonder.  Dec 5-- urlLink IN DEFENSE OF RUMMY  (Apparently Rummy was too direct in his approach for Andrew)   Here's a viewpoint with which I wholeheartedly agree. It's a defense of Donald Rumsfeld's use of the English language. He was given an award for mangling the language by the Plain English Campaign.  But there are very, very few politicians who speak as plainly and simply and strongly as Rumsfeld. His directness about the awful nature of war was a high-point in recent government speech.  You may not like what he has to say, but it's rare that you don't understand what he's saying.  Dec 1-- urlLink ARE WE WINNING IN IRAQ?   (While capturing Saddam was sine qua non of continuing progress--it apparently only counts for about 2 months worth of impact for Sullivan)    It seems to me obvious that in this war, unlike the war against al Qaeda, capturing or killing the central figure, Saddam, is the sine qua non of continuing progress.    Nov 28-- urlLink ONE OF HIS FINEST MOMENTS  (Andrew is one forgetful guy---apparently Bush has a fairly sizeable record of saying what we're fighting for and how important it is that we remain--but Andrew keeps FORGETTING!--One also wonders how this meshes with Andrew's dislike of "platitudes")   ...the visit to Baghdad was spectacular...The president said what almost all of us feel: that those troops out there are doing enormously difficult work and they deserve immeasurable thanks. ...  The president's message to Iraqis was also important: we have to convince the Baathists that we will not falter an iota in accomplishing a peaceful transition to democracy . Some have interpreted the plans for some troop reductions next year as a sign that the president is micro-managing the war to time with his election prospects; or that we are about to pull a Clinton and wriggle out of a commitment.  This trip is the best response to both doubts. It reaffirms resolve, raises morale, and asserts our intention to get this done right. It's called leadership. And we just saw some .  Nov 27-- urlLink "SACRIFICE"     If Mosul is turning against us, we truly are in trouble . And the resistance of Ayatollah Sistani to the current transition process is the first real sign that, on top of Saddam's resistance, we are also about to witness the long-predicted power-struggle between Kurds, Shia and Sunni. It's going to get tougher still.  I don't buy the argument that the administration never warned of a long and difficult post-war in Iraq, because the record shows it did . Whether it did enough - in emphasis - is debatable.  Nov 25-- urlLink THE GRIM TASK IN IRAQ  (Saddam's strategy was clever--yet the Admin are fools for not having a perfect plan to combat it--and more on Andrew's memory problems)    It seems clear now that Saddam has played a simple, clever game: instead of fighting conventionally, he simply withdrew his forces and went into hiding; now he plays a game of guerrilla harassment until the U.S. wearies and pulls out; then he makes another bid for power, in league with Islamists and terrorists of all stripes . In order to keep this from happening, we have to stay in Iraq in considerable numbers for a decade or so. And we have to convince the Iraqis that we mean it. I still don't believe that this administration is intent on premature withdrawal. But I do know we still have a hell of a job ahead of us - in the Sunni Triangle at least.  I know it's early days yet, but the president needs to speak to the public at some point in ways that acknowledge more deeply the long, hard slog we face. And the huge dangers we have yet to encounter on the way.    Nov 18-- urlLink BUSH'S RATINGS  (Sullivan remembers war, forgets it a week later)   The one disturbing thing about this poll is that 64 percent say the casualty rate in this war is "unacceptable." It's a good thing that we are sensitive to such tragedy.  It's real and awful. At the same time, wars kill soldiers. To have invaded and occupied a country of 26 million, defended by the remnants of a brutal dictatorship with nothing to lose, and to have lost between 300 and 400 soldiers is, by historical standards, astonishing . If this is "unacceptable," then we are moving into a situation in which any war is unacceptable. Which is, of course, what the bad guys out there want.   Nov 18- urlLink BRITISH COMMON SENSE  (People know what we're fighting, except they don't)    Combined with Bush's upward poll numbers (see below), I think this is evidence that people do indeed understand what we're fighting,  they see the difference between a country saving another one from chaos and dictatorship and the alleged "evil empire" the Euro-left so despises. The Brits haven't lost their minds.  Nov 11-- urlLink WINNING THE WAR SLOWLY  (How soon Andrew forgets--I mean literally, only like 14 days people)    We get so used to self-criticism we don't yet see how much of the anger now directed at the U.S. is a function of this country's extraordinary success in the war on terror so far. We have destroyed two evil regimes; and are busily rebuilding an entire country in the teeth of limited guerrilla warfare.  Every casualty is awful - but the casualty rate in these wars (on both sides) is an historic low. Everyone knows this. And the enemy, knowing this, is actually afraid. We have to keep them that way.  Nov 10-- urlLink OVER-REACH  (AQ's new strategy indicates we're winning yet losing)   Here's an important change in the conduct of the war. For the first time, Islamist terrorists - both in Iraq, in league with Baathists and now, in Saudi Arabia - are clearly targeting Arabs and fellow Muslims....But in the context of the West's declared war on them, this strikes me as a new and fundamental error on their part.  Maybe it's because our success at knocking al Qaeda off-stride  means they have no option but to hit soft targets in the Muslim world, rather than hard targets over here. Maybe the pressure on them in Iraq is now forcing them to display some kind of "success," even if it means murdering Muslim women and children.  But whatever the reason, this is a propaganda coup for the good guys   Nov 3-- urlLink THE SOMALIA STRATEGY  (Failure to 100% prevent a guerilla war Andrew acknowledges was the plan is a failure of post-war planning)   Another awful day in Iraq. Watching scenes of people celebrating the killing of soldiers, soliders who just liberated them from one of the worst tyrannies on the planet, is enough to make anyone want to leave the place in disgust. But that's the point.  Saddam always relied on the Somalia strategy. He believed - and probably still does - that the U.S. does not have the guts to stick this out and wear down the Sunni dead-enders now combined with Islamist terrorists. He planned on this kind of war of attrition from the minute he knew he was militarily finished . That makes our endurance all the more necessary. The slow collapse of American credibility in the 1990s will take time to reverse. And moments like yesterday are classic attempts to test our determination. Saddam and what he still represents must fail in full view of the world. And we have an irreplaceable opportunity to see it happen.   Oct 30-- urlLink HE TOLD US IT WOULD BE EASY  (contrast the ease with which Sullivan dispatches the notion that Bush said the post-war/reconstruction would be easy with his repeated calls to TELL people that it wouldn't be easy)    Here's another fast-accelerating meme: the president led the American public to believe that the post-war reconstruction of Iraq would be easy, he never anticipated these problems, and can only blame himself for not lowering expectations.  The one true aspect of this seems to me to be the gratuitous symbolism of the USS Lincoln landing and that hubristic banner: "Mission Accomplished." I think I've been proved right about the over-reach there. But rhetorically,  it's fair for the White House to point out that the president did indeed warn about the post-war.  ...  The bottom line: this enormous effort in Iraq will take a long time - years, maybe . Doing it is the only profound measure taken in years to turn the growing threat of Middle Eastern radicalization around. It is a good in itself. It will make us more secure. It has the potential to revolutionize the Arab world. We cannot relent or buckle or show weakness. The real test of this war, as we've known from its inception, will be the years ahead when the memory of 9/11 recedes and the forces of appeasement and amnesia seek to undermine our resolve.   Oct 28-- urlLink YESTERDAY IN IRAQ     There's not much point in sugar-coating what happened. It was a great victory for the Baathists and international terror. If they can keep this up, the chances of a peaceful reconstruction in Iraq look more remote than they did last week . Why? Not because this was that sophisticated an attack, but because it was relatively unsophisticated. Not so much because the Baathists can win, but because they don't have to.  All they have to do is prevent the coalition from winning, which keeps Iraq in limbo, and tilts American public opinion against the war . I'm not an expert but obviously we need a more successful military strategy to defeat these insurgents.  Oct 27-- urlLink ORWELL ON WAR CRITICS  (Also helpful when slogging through another Sullivan column on why we can't win)   "It is, I think, true to say that the intelligentsia have been more wrong about the progress of the war than the common people, and that they were more swayed by partisan feelings. The average intellectual of the Left believed, for instance, that the war was lost in 1940, that the Germans were bound to overrun Egypt in 1942, that the Japanese would never be driven out of the lands they had conquered, and that the Anglo-American bombing offensive was making no impression on Germany. He could believe these things because his hatred for the British ruling class forbade him to admit that British plans could succeed. There is no limit to the follies that can be swallowed if one is under the influence of feelings of this kind. I have heard it confidently stated, for instance, that the American troops had been brought to Europe not to fight the Germans but to crush an English revolution. One has to belong to the intelligentsia to believe things like that: no ordinary man could be such a fool." - from Notes on Nationalism. It's  a helpful quote when slogging through yet another left-liberal column on why we can't win in Iraq.   Oct 27-- urlLink A NEW IRAQ BLOG  (Andrew should re-read this now and then)   From a U.S. soldier with bad spelling. But it's interesting, nonetheless. His depressing thought:   "For so many years America has always cut and run when its soldiers die, pathetic weak leaders we have. Despite many many resistance cells and fedayeen cells that get uncovered and arrested or killed, which we find these cells all the time, despite all the successes (you never hear about in the news) we've had in cracking down on these guys, they still manage to hit us. We can make this Iraq a great place, but it is going to take patience and time, and sadly, the American people I dont believe have the will to do it, we aren't the great generation like in WW2, it makes me sick."  He shouldn't be so downhearted. This president isn't so easily cowed. And the media isn't so insulated from criticism any more.  Oct 24-- urlLink WAR-SPINNING  (Remember Rumsfeld? He who "doesn't get it"?   Slate's Fred Kaplan has sadly become the Krugman of the anti-war brigade. His weirdest claim is that Rummy's memo puts the lie to the notion of progress in Iraq. Huh? The memo was designed to look as critically as possible at general progress in the war on terror. In no way does it deny progress in Iraq toward stabilization and democratization.  In classic Rummy fashion, it simply tries to prod his bureaucracy out of complacency. That's his style. You only have to spend a few minutes debating him to see that...It's this kind of tough self-questioning that makes this unlike Vietnam. And the notion that this is the first time that Rumsfeld has asked such questions strikes me as fantasy. Rumsfeld has been asking questions from the day he became secretary of defense.  And his assessment, after invading two countries, that "we have not yet made truly bold moves" against terrorism is extremely encouraging. He knows we have to find many, many more of these thugs and kill them. In Iraq, we're finally getting a chance.  Oct 24-- urlLink THE RUMMY MEMO     It's the most reassuring statement on the terror war I've yet read. The important thing about any administration in its third year is that it not be complacent, that it not be in denial, and that it ask tough questions of itself. Rumsfeld sure is no McNamara. And if I were a terrorist, I'd be alarmed at how earnest the U.S. government now is about tackling the threat.  Of course, a MoDo column ridiculing this is now inevitable. Which is more indication that it's an encouraging sign.  Oct 20-- urlLink THE DEMS AND IRAQ      ...It is relatively easy to criticize the Iraq war, the intelligence behind it, and the post-war reconstruction. It's another thing to say what you would have done instead. Memories are astonishingly short...      UPDATE: ANDREW SULLIVAN IS HORACE GREELEY PT 2 Oct-Sept 2003--  Many thanks to  urlLink NRO's The Corner  for posting a link to my original post on this topic. (My first serious spike in traffic that didn't involve a search for Paris Hilton).  I realize my post only went from May 04-Oct 03.  I think it would behoove both myself and any readers to not continue looking back at least until around the start of the war.    I will try to be far less sarcastic/snarky in my comments--I recognize Andrew's commitment to the war in a general sense, my purpose here is merely to point out some of the more noteworthy swings in emotion that he has displayed on his blog. It should also be noted that many of these statements/comments by themselves are unobjectionable--but when contrasted with later/earlier statements, they show a fairly pronounced tendency of Sullivan to go where the wind takes him.  And so we begin:  Oct 11-- urlLink FRONTLINE CONCEDES  (This illustrates Sullivan's earlier attempts--successful ones--to combat the "imminent threat" meme that was floating around at the time--but contrast it with his later posts that that particular rationale for the war (WMD and the capacity to make it--which was part and parcel of the "grave and gathering danger" argument is no longer remotely valid.)   Here's how the leading anti-war Democrat - yes, Howard Dean - described Bush's position on September 29, 2002: "The president has never said that Saddam has the capability of striking the United States with atomic or biological weapons any time in the immediate future." I would say that "any time in the immediate future" is as good a definition as any of the word "imminent."  So was even Howard Dean spinning for Bush? Of course not. He was summing up the simple truth .  Oct 11-- urlLink JUST A REMINDER  (If the judgment of those Dems who believed Saddam was a threat, had WMD and the capacity to make them, and should be removed was correct even if "some of the intelligence may well turn out to be wrong"--how does that rationale for the war go away? Wouldn't it still be perfectly valid as Sullivan suggests?   Here are a few choice quotes from Democrats in the period leading up to the war to disarm and depose Saddam. They are all almost identical to the Bush administration's statements. None claim an "imminent" threat. All  suggest a real and growing danger. Some of the intelligence may well turn out to be wrong. But their concerns were real; and their judgment correct.   Oct 11-- urlLink AND LIFE RETURNS    After Saddam, the Iraqi Marsh Arabs, their lives and traditions violated by Saddam, enjoy the benefits of America's liberation:   The marsh has once again assumed its omnipresent role in the village. Women clad in black head-to-toe abayas wade into the water to wash clothes. The mullet found in the murky depths, though small and bony, is grilled for dinner every night. Swamp grasses are cut to feed the cows and sheep that will eventually be traded for water buffalo.  "Everyone is so happy," Kerkush said as he watched his son stand in a mashoof and steer it like a gondolier with a long wooden pole. "We are starting to live like we used to, not the way Saddam wanted us to live."   How can you not be moved by such a story? How can you not be proud of what we have done?   Oct 10-- urlLink WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED  (following an impressive listing of CPA accomplishments in Iraq)   This is what some in this country want to stop. This is what would never have happened if we'd let Saddam Hussein stay in power. It's simply beyond me how anyone can describe this war as about "oil" or about "imperialism" or about "greed" or "militarism." It remains one of the most humanitarian acts in modern history. And, if successful, it could turn an entire region around - a region that has been the main source of real danger to itself and to the West in my lifetime.  I'm banging on about this not simply because it's by far the most important issue in our politics right now, but because a wilful and petty disinformation campaign is being waged to distort this achievement, undermine it, and reverse it. We mustn't let that happen. We cannot let these people - and ourselves - down again .  Oct 8-- urlLink HINDSIGHT BIAS  (this includes selections from a piece Sullivan cites approvingly since little commentary is given by Andrew himself here--presumably he agrees with it.  Also, if the solution is "pragmatic muddling through" it is highly disingenuous to take the Admin to task for failing to plan for that which it can only be said in hindsight they failed to account for)   As he often does,  the incomparable Jon Rauch homes in on the central distortion in the current discussion of the Iraq war :   "Iraq is ridden with hindsight bias. For instance, the Bush administration should have -- must have -- seen the gaps in its prewar intelligence (they are pretty evident now). And the notion that the occupation could be run with a few divisions -- how naive was that? And wasn't it obvious that the military would need to patrol the streets from the day the war ended?   Hindsight bias raises false expectations and nurtures conspiracy theories. Perhaps worst, it leads to ricocheting errors as people look backward through distorted lenses and then overcompensate looking ahead.  War critics who today revel in hindsight bias might do well to recall an earlier instance: the claim that the first President Bush's failure to march to Baghdad and unseat Saddam was a gross error. It was not. In early 1991, the smart money was on Saddam's soon being toppled, and the first Bush wanted to avoid precisely the sort of ugly occupation that the second Bush now finds himself conducting. The second war grew partly from hindsight bias in evaluations of the first."    The solution is pragmatic muddling through.  That's what Condi is now trying to coordinate. It's the essence of good government. And we have many months to judge its effects - with as little hindsight bias as possible.   Oct 7-- urlLink SPINNING THE PRE-WAR  (Sullivan notes the primary rationale for the war was to prevent Saddam from becoming an "imminent" threat--only to reject the entire argument later)   ...the war was a continuation of the last one, and was fully supported by umpteen U.N. resolutions, including a 15-0 Security Council vote to force Saddam to comply. 9/11 made a war far more conceivable because it revealed the U.S.'s vulnerability to fanatical terrorists who might get hold of WMDs from Saddam.  The casus belli was not proof of Saddam's existing weapons, but proof of his refusal to cooperate fully with U.N. inspectors or account fully for his WMD research. Nothing we have discovered after the war has debunked or undermined any of these reasons. And the moral reason for getting rid of an unconscionably evil regime has actually gotten stronger now we see the full extent of his terror-state.  But the anti-war left sees a real advantage in stripping down the claims in people's receding memories to ones that were not made but which can now be debunked. It's propaganda, to which the media in particular seems alarmingly prone to parroting.  Oct 6--Sullivan does a good job of debunking the "uranium from Niger" meme that was out and about--rather than post a link--just including the point for balance.  Oct 6-- urlLink THE CRITICAL POINT  (More on the rationale that no longer exists for Sullivan)   What we need is an analysis of why we got wrong what we got wrong. There's no question that we were led to believe that there were stockpiles of WMDs unaccounted for in Saddam's Iraq before the war. And we still don't have a good explanation for that.  But this does not mean that the war was not justified in the terms under which it was waged: that Iraq had an obligation to account fully for its WMD program (it didn't), that it cease all such research and development (it didn't), that it stop deceiving U.N. inspectors (it didn't), and, above all, that it posed a threat, via intermediary terrorists, that was intolerable after 9/11 (it did without a shadow of a doubt, as the Kay report shows).  Is this kind of nuanced assessment - important for our future intelligence and war-making capacity as well as democratic accountability - possible in today's polarized culture? We better hope it is.   Oct 3-- urlLink THE PREZ GETS IT  (but apparently lost it fairly soon)   The president needs to make a ferocious speech soon expanding on these facts [following a speech on the Kay report] and take the truth to his opponents' deception. This is vital.  He has nothing to apologize for and huge amount to be proud of. So go get 'em, Mr President.  What's holding you back?   Oct 3-- urlLink READ THE REPORT  (Sullivan goes to great lengths to defend the Kay report--such a defense is notably absent in his later posts)    If you think that David Kay's report on Iraqi WMDs can be adequately summarized by idiotic headlines such as: "No Illicit Arms Found in Iraq," then you need to read this report.  If you believe the following "news analysis" by David Sanger in today's New York Times summarizes the findings of David Kay, then you need to read this report. ... The administration claimed that Saddam had used WMDs in the past, had hidden materials from the United Nations, was hiding a continued program for weapons of mass destruction, and that we should act before the threat was imminent. The argument was that it was impossible to restrain Saddam Hussein unless he were removed from power and disarmed. The war was legally based on the premise that Saddam had clearly violated U.N. resolutions, was in open breach of such resolutions and was continuing to conceal his programs with the intent of restarting them in earnest once sanctions were lifted.  Having read the report carefully, I'd say that the administration is vindicated in every single respect of that argument. This war wasn't just moral; it wasn't just prudent; it was justified on the very terms the administration laid out. And we don't know the half of it yet .  Oct 3-- urlLink THE MONEY QUOTES  (The war was justified...except it wasn't)   Translation: Saddam was lying to the U.N. as late as 2002.  He was required by the U.N. to fully cooperate. He didn't. The war was justified on those grounds alone.  Case closed. Some of the physical evidence still remains, despite what was clearly a deliberate, coordinated and thorough attempt to destroy evidence before during and after the war.   Oct 3-- urlLink THERE'S MORE  (What a WMD program "was never about" is apparently what a WMD program is now all about--so long as it fits a current narrative)    One of the crazy premises of the "Where Are They?" crowd is that we would walk into that huge country and find large piles of Acme bombs with anthrax in them. That's not what a WMD program is about; and never was Saddam was careful. He had to hide from the U.N. and he had to find ways, over more than a decade, to maintain a WMD program as best he could, ready to reactivate whenever the climate altered in his favor. Everything points to such a strategy and to such weapons being maintained.   Oct 3-- urlLink A FRACTION SO FAR  (aside from the rise in terror attacks--which Sullivan concedes was bound to happen anyway--he is correct)   Were there risks of action? You bet. But most of the enormous risks did not come about: no use of such weapons, no massive destruction of oil wells, no fracturing of the country, no terrorist revenge or resurgence.   Oct 3-- urlLink FOR THE FUTURE  (This was a really happy day for Andrew)   I've waited a long time for this report, and kept my peace until it came out and we had some empirical data to measure.  But what we now see may not impress those who are looking for any way to discredit this administration and this war. But it shows to my mind the real danger that Saddam posed - and would still pose today, if one president and one prime minister hadn't had the fortitude to face him down. We live in a dangerous but still safer world because of it.  Now is the time for the administration to stop the internal quibbling, the silence and passivity, and go back on the offensive. Show the dangers that the opposition was happy for us to tolerate; show the threat - real and potential - that this war averted; and defend the record with pride and vigor; and fund the reconstruction in ways that will make it work now not just for our sake but for the sake of those once killed in large numbers by the weapons some are so eager not to find.  Oct 1-- urlLink BLAIR'S WAR  (Bush made the right decision to go to war despite the flawed intelligence--but he made the wrong decision to go to war because of the flawed intelligence)   I know that any concession with regard to fallible pre-war intelligence can lead to the anti-war hysterics piling on and the Democratic opportunists playing clairvoyants.  But the point of concession is to say that he took the right decision, even if the intelligence turned out to be flawed, and may have to make a similar decision again . The threat has not gone away. It's a complicated war and not susceptible to swift or easy fixes. But it's still a war we have to fight. Or perish.  Sept 29-- urlLink DOWD DEGENERATES  (Sullivan rejects, then channels Dowd)    After two of the most target-precise wars ever conducted, with billions of reconstruction money going to Iraq, with levels of human freedom in both countries unprecedented in their history?  Trashed? Dowd thinks that it was American intervention and not Saddam and sanctions that "trashed" Iraq? Is she serious? Stupid question.   Sep 17-- urlLink MARSHALL AGAIN    A blogger points out that in post-war Europe the U.S. never spent more than 5 percent of the GNP of the recipient country. The impact of money up to 50 percent of a country's GNP is unprecedented. Surely it will have a huge impact. Obviously, money isn't enough - cultural, social and ethnic factors may well be more critical in determining Iraq's possible emergence into the civilized democratic world.  But no one can claim the Bush administration isn't committing enough resources .  Sept 17-- urlLink BIGGER THAN MARSHALL (Again, have events SO changed on the ground that these figures are false or is it more Sullivan's tendency to "oversell" his POV)   If you assume we will spend the full $20 billion in the next year in Iraq and that Iraq's population is around 24 million,  then our current commitment is something over $800 per capita. That strikes me as a real and extraordinary commitment . (A genuine comparison to Marshall won't be possible for a couple of years, which is also revealing. Back then, people seemed to understand it would take time to resurrect a viable democracy and economy in devastated Germany.  Why do people expect it to occur overnight in Iraq?  Hitler's economic skills were a lot better than Saddam's.) So here's a question worth asking: Why is it that this is not more fully acknowledged by those critics of this administration?  I for one was worried that Rummy's penny-pinching would mean no real nation-building in Iraq. It's clear now that that isn't going to happen. And when you consider we're also going to be spending around $2400 per capita on security, it's an astonishing act of generosity (as well as a vital piece of self-interest) . Where are the Democrats praising this initiative instead of seeking apologies and political advantage?  Bush has done exactly what hawkish Democrats were afraid he would punt on. Good for him.    Sept 17-- urlLink A CONSERVATIVE CRITIQUE  (One wonders if Sullivan can be placed into the camp of the "American Political Class")    But Helprin's argument helps us remember that the American response to a declaration of war has been measured, patient and, now, extremely generous . I also think he's right about the need for much bigger military expenditures than we now have. We are dangerously vulnerable to a real threat from North Korea, while we are engaged in the Middle East. But  if the American political class has been so divided over even the modest measures we have taken to fight back so far, what hope would there have been for a more ambitious campaign?   Sept 17-- urlLink THE UNHINGED LEFT  (Contrast the call to not lose perspective with Sullivan's posts re: the prisoner abuse scandal)   I certainly respect pragmatic liberals who opposed the war and still do.  But even they - especially they - can also see the benefits of releasing a people from a terrible and grotesque police state and removing Saddam from power .  To lose sight of these things is a sign of a warped and increasingly unbalanced perspective.    Sept 15-- urlLink BURNS ON THE MEDIA IN IRAQ  (noteworthy for the scorn and distrust Sullivan lays on the media for constant negative reporting--note the lack of such skepticism lately)   The best reporter by far on Saddam Hussein's Iraq unloads a devastating barrage against his fellow hacks in Editor and Publisher. The New York Times'  John F. Burns reveals just how compromised and corrupt so many journalists were in Iraq , how willing they were to hide the atrocities of the regime, how their own self-interest trumped the truth. ...  [The media] won't ignore even a single guerrilla attack on coalition forces, will they?   Sept 12-- urlLink THE GREAT DIVIDE  (For Sullivan, it's only his third or fourth instinct...tops!--Of course, Sullivan did not go so far as to claim America was evil--but when you argue that the humanitarian/moral argument for war is hanging on by a mere thread--that's pretty close)    For these people, the first instinct is always, always, always, that the United States is morally suspect. They haven't changed. The moral clarity after 9/11 terrified them. They wanted it to go away so badly so they could switch the conversation back to the faults and evils of America.    Sept 12-- urlLink CLARITY FATIGUE  (Sullivan appears the victim on his own diagnosis)    And they have, of course, partly succeeded  - not because they managed to inflate, say, Enron's collapse into the greater event (though that was one of the more comic Raines-Krugman gambits).  They succeeded in the end not by argument but by the effect of sheer fatigue . No democracy wants to believe it is under dire threat;  no one wants the abnormality to endure; no one wants to absorb the truth that the war is still in its infancy and that greater atrocities lie ahead,  unless we act forcefully to pre-empt them and build the kind of societies in the Middle East that are alone guarantees of our and their future peace and stability.  I have made plenty of criticisms of this president; and will do so again. But he's currently the only leader in this country who actually gets the depth of our predicament and the need for innovative, enterprising and ruthless action to improve it. The paradox is that the more he succeeds and the more the threat of terror recedes, the more his opponents will take the calm as evidence that nothing much has to be done, that nothing much has been done, that America, by acting, is the real source of world conflict, and that retreat and amnesia are the cure-alls. I don't think most Americans believe this. I think they are still angry and still afraid and still determined. But they will suffer more than a thousand cuts from the September 10 brigades in the coming months and years.  I remember thinking two years ago that support for the war was easy then; but the real test would be in a few years when forgetfulness would set in and complacency revived. Which means, of course, that the real test of our mettle is now.  So the question is not, once again: what have we done wrong? It is: Where are we going to hit those bastards today?    Sept 11-- urlLink WAGE WAR  (We have made "real achievements"--that and a dime will get you a cup of coffee)   When you remember this thoroughly, you might still want to argue and debate about the accuracy of WMD intelligence in Iraq or the merits of the post-war reconstruction in Afghanistan or the nuances of U.N. and U.S. control in post-Saddam Iraq. Those kinds of fights are what democracies relish and do well. And it's equally true that anger is not an emotion that lasts. Human beings simply cannot live with that kind of fear or that kind of fury for very long. But we can still nurture what might be called the cold rage of reason: the calculated and calm recollection of what was done and what we can still do to prevent it again. And the key resolve I felt that day was not to let this act of war become in our minds an isolated occurrence, separate and apart from all the regimes that foster Islamo-fascism and seek to harm the West. In fighting back, we had to stop the defensiveness and ad hoc approach of the late twentieth century (both in the Clinton and early Bush administrations) and go on the offensive, tackle this nightmare at its roots, get our hands dirty, risk failure and aim for real success. That's the difference between police work and war.  That's why the astonishingly humane wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are just the beginning of a long attempt to bring the Middle East out of the dark ages. Some are now arguing that there is a dimmer light at the end of this tunnel. They're wrong. We have accomplished a huge amount, both in weakening al Qaeda, destroying Saddam and bringing flickers of democracy and pluralism into a region long victimized by tyranny and theocracy. These are real achievements.  They are the platform for the next phase: in building a free society in Iraq, toppling yet more tyranny in Iran, removing the Saudi dictatorship, and bringing some kind of settlement to Israel. We cannot disengage now. And standing still is to move backwards. Wars are dynamic; and we are in a war. Still. Two years later. With work to be done.   Sept 10--Here is a series of posts where Andrew does effective work in  urlLink dismantling   the "We squandered world sympathy" argument.  There are several posts--better to link to them all collectively (and they are less directly war related than this topic intends to cover)  Sept 9-- urlLink CONTRA SALETAN  (When read in light of his recent postings--this passage could augur both for AND against the war--against in that it could be viewed as ironic)    But the point about Iraq was not that it was uniquely involved in terrorism, but that it was far more doable than any of the others.  It was already in violation of umpteen international resolutions; no one could defend the regime (which was more brutal even than its neighbors); and the WMD issue was a real worry (one that has turned out in retrospect to be far less scary than we were led to believe).  So, in the context of a truly aggressive war on terror, we went after the Saddam dictatorship first. We had to start somewhere .  Sept 8-- urlLink INSTA-PUNDIT  (Sullivan is open to persuasion on there not being a need for more troops--so long as that persuasion calls for more troops.--Also contrast Bush's laying out the broad objectives of the war with Sullivan's consistent criticism that Bush does NOT do just that)   It was a good speech, well delivered. The only unnerving feeling I got was when the president said he didn't want or need more U.S. troops. I remain unconvinced - but, hey, I'm open to persuasion. Max Boot says we need more civilians instead. Fine. Let's have more civilians. But we need to be told exactly what the problem is and how we're going to fix it. The president didn't exactly do that.  What he did do was lay out the broad objectives of the war on terror, explain better how Iraq is a central part of it, and with a request for $87 billion, showed that he means business. That was overdue and refreshing . Again, the speech would have seemed far less defensive if Bush hadn't given the impression months ago that the war was over. If there's been some public wobbling, I think it's partly because of post-war hubris by the administration itself. But I think the White House understands that now.  Critics will say that the Iraq-terror connection, brutally outlined in the Washington Post yesterday, is a result of the war and didn't exist beforehand. They're wrong. The links between Baathist remnants and al Qaeda are obviously stronger now than the links between al Qaeda and the Saddam regime a year ago - but they all always had a common goal: the prevention of the liberalization of the Arab world and the defeat of Western interests through terror, both state-sponsored and otherwise. We've flushed them out but we haven't yet destroyed them. Now we have a chance to go in for the kill.  If Bush can successfully persuade people that violence in Iraq is a) unavoidable and b) an opportunity, then he will be far more persuasive in the coming months. And we all need him to be.   Sept 7-- urlLink FLYPAPER-IT'S WORKING  (While Sullivan qualifies it with "if this pans out"--is there anything to indicate that the flypaper theory is NOT panning out?)    If this pans out, then the Bush administration really will have pulled off something important: taken the war to the enemy, taken it out of the West, and given us a chance for military victory.  What Bush must tell us tonight is that the war in Iraq, far from having ended, is now entering its most critical phase. That's why we need more troops, more resources and more focus. Now.  Sept 6-- urlLink A GREAT SOURCE ON IRAQ  (Admittedly, Sullivan has been consistent in his calls for more troops--even if his reasons for it have varied greatly)    My own view that we do indeed need more troops for basic security measures was only buttressed by this report in the New York Times today. Many munitions dumps only lightly protected? Why don't we just hand the terrorists weapons while we're at it?  Glad to see the president is going to address the country tomorrow night on the state of play in Iraq. I hope it isn't just pablum or optimism. He needs to frankly acknowledge the problems, as well as telling us how we are going to overcome them.   Sept 5-- urlLink LETTER FROM IRAQ    Here's another letter from a soldier in Iraq, doing amazing work. He's Lieutenant Colonel Steven D. Russell, the Battalion Commander of the 1st Battalion of the 22nd Infantry, 4th Infantry Division.  I wish, reading this, that it gave me more reassurance. Some progress; some setbacks; but a hellish scene nonetheless .  Sept 4-- urlLink STRAW TELLS IT LIKE IT IS    He wants more troops and more resources. The Telegraph hints the British initiative is also designed to buttress the White House's resolve in providing more troops. Let's hope it works.  For the record, I see nothing wrong with the U.S. seeking U.N. help and support in Iraq, even if it means losing some control. What matters now is rescuing Iraq from the logic of chaos and terror. And for the record, worrying about the drift in Iraq is not a function of going wobbly. Not worrying - and coming up with all sorts of facile defenses of what is clearly going awry - that is going wobbly.   Sept 4-- urlLink THE ENEMY REGROUPS?  (Could ys just pick one? Please?)   More troubling news from the war. This time, in Afghanistan. On the other hand, here's another report, picked up by an intrepid blogger, that brings better news. Whom to believe?  Maybe the truth is that the Taliban are resurgent, due, in part, to our poor follow-through in Afghanistan, but it is just as true that those soldiers who are there are doing a great job, given their limited numbers and resources. Which is why we need more resources for rebuilding Afghanistan and more troops to police it. C'mon, Dubya. Follow-through; follow-through. Some of us are worried not because we want you to fail, but because we want you to succeed .  Sept 3-- urlLink WOBBLY? MOI?  (That Sullivan was being accused as early as 2 years after 9/11 is telling)    A few of you complained that I was going wobbly in the war on terror in my posts yesterday.  Au contraire. It's precisely because I believe in this war passionately that I believe we need more commitment, more money and more troops to aid the effort. The issue should never be: do you support the president? The issue should be: is what the president doing going to work?  I'm not omniscient, but it's simply crazy to deny the real problems we are facing right now and the need for clear and urgent thinking about them. Many Americans who support the war agree. That's not going wobbly; it's doing what any thinking person should do, which is try and figure out what's going wrong and how to fix it . Mercifully, the administration seems to be trying to find a way to make the liberation work, with more international back-up. They're not that pig-headed. The president has no bigger fan in his conduct of the war so far.  But my fear is that he is going astray. Am I supposed to keep that under wraps? As for the aricraft carrier landing, my point is that Bush gave the impression that the war was over by that event. That very signal made it look as if the current violence - a war with growing intensity - is somehow a reversal of that achievement, rather than a continuation of the struggle.  It has undermined him. And we need him. I'm still wildly unconvinced that any of the Democrats can be trusted with this war. Which is why it's even more important to ensure that the only man who can wage it doesn't fail. Want to hear reflexive defenses of everything the administration does? Go read someone else.  Sept 3-- urlLink BUSH HATRED REVISITED  (Sullivan decries the use of "liar" but later admits the Admin mislead on WMD--which contrasts nicely with his vigorous defense of the Kay report)   But the trope that has really caught on among elites is the notion that Bush is a liar. The New Republic and Paul Krugman trumpeted this charge early on, and now the Washington Monthly has chimed in, with one of the most fatuous and rigged pieces of lazy insta-journalism I've read in a while. (Bob Somerby gets it right, for once.) It's not just that I find the Monthly's (and Krugman's) charges silly.  They conflate mis-statements, deliberate confusion, euphemism, ignorance and dishonesty in ways that make it hard for anyone to emerge a non-liar. It's more that when you start using the term "liar" promiscuously in public discourse, you make such discourse increasingly impossible. The term should be reserevd only for a conscious and deliberate statement that you know is untrue as you sepak or write it .  Sept 2-- urlLink MISSION UNACCOMPLISHED  (eh, the whole post is worth reading...but I'll only highlight a couple sentences)   And then there's the war.  I could forgive this administration almost anything if it got the war right.  But, after a great start, it's getting hard to believe the White House is in control of events any more. Osama bin Laden is regrouping in Afghanistan; Saddam, perhaps in league with al Qaeda, is fighting back in Iraq. The victims of terror in Iraq blame the United States - not the perpetrators - for the chaos. And the best news of the war - that Shi'a, Sunnis, and Kurds were not at each others' throats - is now fraying. Worse, the longer the impasse continues the harder it will be to get ourselves out of it. About this we hear two refrains from the White House: a) everything is going fine, actually; and b) this new intensity of terror in Iraq is a good thing because it helps us fight the enemy on military, rather than civilian, terrain. The trouble that we're discovering is that a full-scale anti-terror war is not exactly compatible with the careful resusictation of civil order and democratic government, is it? And if we are in a new and vital war, why are we not sending more troops to fight it? And why are we not planning big increases in funding for the civil infrastructure at the same time? The response so far does not strike me as commensurate with the problem, and I say this as a big supporter of this war. What to do? I'd be hard put to express it better than John McCain Sunday: more troops, more money, more honesty from the president about the challenges, swifter devolution of power to Iraqis, and so on. And yet the White House in August decided to devote the president's public appearances to boosting his environmental credibility.  Are they losing it? So far, I've been manfully trying to give the administration the benefit of the doubt, especially given the media's relentlessly negative coverage of Iraq. But they're beginning to lose me, for the same reasons they're losing Dan Drezner. They don't seem to grasp the absolutely vital necessity of success in Iraq. And I can't believe I'm writing that sentence.     UPDATE: I've decided not to go any further back...I think I've made my point sufficiently to not require such an investment of time and energy.

       MY  TROY  REVIEW .  Wife and I saw  Troy  yesterday.  Overall I enjoyed it.  Some curiosities--Troy stars almost the entire cast of  Braveheart --(Uncle Argyle, Habish, Habish's Dad, I even think the guy that played the executioner made an appearance)  That being said, Brian Cox as Agamemnon was excellent as a power hungry king looking for a pretext to war.  Eric Bana as Hector was also good--Paris was a pansy. And Brad Pitt as Achilles was well--Brad Pitt as Achilles.   Some fairly major story errors off the top of my head (been years since I read the poem):  (1) Instead of lasting 10 years--which would have really underscored the grinding effect of the war--the film compressed the Trojan war to about a month at most.   (2) Instead of going insane and killing himself--Ajax is killed by Hector (which kind of sucked because even though he was distinctly  Viking  in appearance--the guy that played Ajax was cool.  (FYI: He played Sabertooth in X-Men)  (3) Agamemnon bites it in a fairly annoying display of "grrl-power"  Those were the ones I saw and didn't like--that and some of the editing was just BAD--it seemed choppy going from scene to scene and tended to make the film seem far more disjointed that it should have.   Overall? I'd give it a B.

       OFFENSIVE CHARM.   The US Olympic Cmte has told its athletes to  urlLink not wave the American flag during their medal celebrations  in Greece this summer.  The plan is part of a charm offensive aimed at repairing the country's international reputation after the deepening crisis in Iraq and damaging revelations of the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners by U.S. forces at the Abu Ghraib prison.  You have got to be shitting me. Oh there's more:   "What I am telling the athletes is, 'Don't run over and grab a flag and take it round the track with you.' It's not business as usual for American athletes. If a Kenyan or a Russian grabs their national flag and runs round the track or holds it high over their heads, it might not be viewed as confrontational. Where we are in the world right now, an American athlete doing that might be viewed in another manner."   Actually winning the events might be viewed as "confrontational" as well.

       JONAH GOLDBERG MIGHT NOT BE WRONG.  Paul over at Wizbang writes:   Last night I got a phone call with some information about Nick Berg. Much of which I posted last night. Some of it I have not run with because I don't trust it as much as I trusted the password story. I won't post the rest yet, but I'll say this about it. We know nothing about the time between when he left Iraqi (U.S.?) custody and when he showed up in an orange jumpsuit. If my source is correct about what happened, it raises considerable questions about Nick Berg.   In all honesty, is it really responsible, ethical, or even decent, to make such a charge WITHOUT disclosing the information that leads one to reach that conclusion?  If you want to say that you have info that "raises serious questions"--fine. Post that information and let the readers make up their minds whether it raises such questions.  Otherwise, it's just rumor-mongering and speculation.  If you DON'T want to disclose the information--then don't claim that there are "serious questions" about Nick Berg caused by anything other than what is publicly available.    UPDATE :  I wrongly failed to link the post in question--my error. Here is Paul's post  urlLink in toto

       JONAH GOLDBERG IS WRONG.   In a post today,  urlLink The Corner's  Jonah Goldberg writes that it appears to him that:  Berg was apparently something of a leftwing peacenik and his parents apparently belong to ANSWER. Travelling around Iraq alone the way he did is just odd.    As evidence of his claim is this  urlLink article  from the Philly Inquirier.    However, nothing in the paper’s story supports the assertion that he was a man of the left.  The article describes him as idealist (doesn’t say what ideals) and interested in the local culture (hardly a uniformly leftist trait)—indeed, nothing in the article backs up the assertion that he was of the same stripe as a Rachel Corrie (a charge Jonah lays).  With the exception of the as-yet unexplained Moussaoui link—nothing in the article backs Goldberg up.  Nick Berg may well have been an idealist conservative who rejected his father’s 1960’s liberalism (it HAS been known to happen) to take part in what he saw as a worthy cause in Iraq.  But then again, there’s nothing in the article to support THAT either.    Until there is, all we know is that Nick Berg was an American.  An American murdered by a group of pathetic cowards who, if given half the chance, would do the same to every one of us.  In some respects, that may be all we need to know.   UPDATE :  I emailed Jonah my comments and he replied back that he will be updating his post shortly.  So...I'm updating  my  post.

       KURT LASH V RANDY BARNETT--THROWDOWN!  I had the pleasure of having Prof. Lash as my Con Law II professor last semester (got a 92 in it...heh)--and we also had the pleasure of hosting Prof Randy Barnett in a discussion of his recent book:  urlLink  Restoring the Lost Constitution: The Presumption of Liberty   in which Prof Lash took part.  The discussion was genial but there was some fairly substantive disagreement over the original(ist?) meaning of the 9th Amendment. Prof Barnett took a more "libertarian"-esque approach that argued the 9th was more concerned with protecting rights at an  individual  level whereas Prof. Lash argued that the 9th was more geared towards respecting/increasing  state  autonomy.  Well, pursuant to a  urlLink post  on Larry Solum's Blog on Originalism and Liberty-- urlLink Prof Lash emailed Prof Solum  with some comments/questions re: Prof Barnett's basic thesis.  Randy Barnett  urlLink responds.   Two men enter; One man leaves.

After all, if you think that this abuse was policy or was present on a wide scale and not limited to a handful of jagoffs, can you really support the troops?

       THE FRENCH INSTANT MESSENGING MIND.   While outlining Business Associations--I rec'd a random Instant Message from a person from France which resulted in a fairly interesting (to see the European mind at work) conversation re: free speech, presidential power, and ultimately....Kyoto.  Some of his/her phrasings show something of a problem with the language, but you get the idea. Here it is (long, but amusing if you get through it):   Cycy1384 : hi  CXCross : evening  Cycy1384 : morning lol  CXCross : not quite yet  Cycy1384 : depends where u live  CXCross : I'm in Los Angeles, you?  Cycy1384 : Lyon   Cycy1384 : hum do u know where it is?  CXCross : France?  Cycy1384 : woow good  CXCross : :-)  Cycy1384 : u impress me  CXCross : Hey, thanks :-P  Cycy1384 : u're welcome  Cycy1384 : not a lot of merican knows   CXCross : I wonder how Americans do...  Cycy1384 : u surely dunno why i imed u   CXCross : Surely  Cycy1384 : lolol  Cycy1384 : i found u in the law list lol  CXCross : Ahh  Cycy1384 : yah some people know how to use the icone " find a buddy" lol  CXCross : So why law? :-P  Cycy1384 : hummm   CXCross : I mean, I get lots of IM's from dumbass 16 yr olds asking me if they get busted with pot, how much trouble are they in?  Cycy1384 : i think   Cycy1384 : fortunately that i dunno what means busted with pot lol  CXCross : arrested for marijuana posession  Cycy1384 : ohhhhhh  Cycy1384 : and they come to knowwhat?  Cycy1384 : they're guilty ..  CXCross : generally  Cycy1384 : i'm a student in politcal sciences and law  CXCross : Undergraduate?  Cycy1384 : and i wanted a point of view   CXCross : on?  Cycy1384 : but an american one  Cycy1384 : 2 nd year  CXCross : right, but not yet in law school I mean, right?  Cycy1384 : law school   Cycy1384 : i wonder if its really existing over here  CXCross : So what did you want a point of view on?  Cycy1384 : humm i had a partiel   Cycy1384 : and the subject ( all in english argh ) was nearly that :  Cycy1384 : is public figures need protection from media for emotional distress more than people have the freedom of speech and say everything   Cycy1384 : we had as example the case of larry flynt  CXCross : I disagree. People are public figures usually by their own efforts and actions--one of the costs of placing yourself into the public realm is that you open yourself up to criticism/insults/language--usually very harsh criticism/language.  Cycy1384 : lol u agree with everyone except me   Cycy1384 : i'm the only one for 280 people saying : well i totally agree   Cycy1384 : and that the reason why i came to talk to u lol   CXCross : For a "priviate" individual who has NOT placed themselves in the public sphere--then their right to privacy trumps the public's right to say anything about them--because they have not availed themselves to the public--they still should be able to claim emotional distress  CXCross : For my part, it's a first amendment/freedom of speech thing  Cycy1384 : yah the first amendement   Cycy1384 : i said we have to limit it ..  Cycy1384 : i proposed that even if ur a public figure , u have a private life and we cant criticize everything like we can see for the american election   CXCross : It is limited already  Cycy1384 : well larry flynt won   CXCross : Right, but he wasn't the one claiming emotional distress  CXCross : Jerry Falwell was  Cycy1384 : yah true  Cycy1384 : for me jerry falwell was right  CXCross : And Falwell--by virtue of his public status--could not claim emotional distress  CXCross : without a showing of actual malice  CXCross : if I recall correctlyu  Cycy1384 : but a public figure is an human being nah?  CXCross : took 1st amendment law last semester  CXCross : Right, which is why we can't just kill them  Cycy1384 : hum jerry wasnot guilty of nothing yet   Cycy1384 : why he cant be protected ?  CXCross : Jerry was the plaintiff  CXCross : he was suing Larry  Cycy1384 : true  Cycy1384 : but for me larry needed to be going in jail for that   CXCross : Nah--while distasteful--that is something of the price one pays for entering into the public arena  Cycy1384 : I disagree   Cycy1384 : i think we are in the point   Cycy1384 : because we are a public figure we have to accept all critizies , insults and all?  CXCross : Not all--just most.  Cycy1384 : god lol  CXCross : If someone made overt threats of violence...that'd be illegal  CXCross : or attempted to incite violence against you...that's illegal too  Cycy1384 : i explained in my copy , that i dont accept that because i'm european lol do u think the corrector will kik me?  Cycy1384 : but for me , just claiming rumor is illegal   CXCross : Well, I'd argue that Europe and the US have fairly divergent histories when it comes to freedom of speech and its limits on it  Cycy1384 : yah   Cycy1384 : dont u think american law is scaring?  CXCross : Scary? Not at all  CXCross : I happen to like it  Cycy1384 : u know we were shocked by monica lewinsky story   CXCross : I don't doubt it. But I do doubt that you heard the full story  Cycy1384 : well one of my friend told me , people were not well with the president only cause he lied   CXCross : The issue regarding Clinton's impeachment was not that he had sex...but rather that he lied about it UNDER OATH.  CXCross : In a judicial proceeding  Cycy1384 : but at the begining its is private life nah?  CXCross : It was his private life--but it was also the subject of an authorized investigation arising out of a civil suit for sexual harassment  Cycy1384 : i still think it s scarying yet lol   CXCross : Just because it's your private life doesn't mean you can be compelled to testify about it  CXCross : "Where were you last night?"  Cycy1384 : well we never talk about our president over here  CXCross : "Sorry, that's my private life"  CXCross : Because you have parliamentary system, yes? President doesn't matter much overall  Cycy1384 : president is powerfull   Cycy1384 : not as ur yet for sure   CXCross : Our president isn't any more powerful than was Bill Clinton  CXCross : Or George Bush, or Reagan, or Carter, Nixon, etc etc  Cycy1384 : but ur president did things clinton never did   CXCross : That's true, but uninformative  Cycy1384 : uninformative?  CXCross : Clinton did things Bush never did...  Cycy1384 : lolol   Cycy1384 : I SEE WHAT U MEAN lol   CXCross : The statement, without more, means nothing  Cycy1384 : but clinton was good for the international scene  Cycy1384 : whereas bush wow   CXCross : Clinton did very little for int'l scene  Cycy1384 : HE DID well for isrealo palestinian conflit   CXCross : He went into Haiti, Kosovo, and bombed Iraq all without UN approval...  CXCross : No, he brokered a deal that Arafat rejected.  CXCross : He rejected Kyoto (as did our Senate, 99 to nothing)  Cycy1384 : kyoto is a wordl treaty   Cycy1384 : we still are shocked by this rejection   CXCross : To which the US has not ratified  Cycy1384 : here we think the usa are collapsing slowly   CXCross : We're not. Kyoto exempts both China and India and would cost the US about $150 billion a year and, at best, would delay temperature increases by 6 years  CXCross : I.E. the temp it would be in 2100 WITHOUT Kyoto we would reach in 2106 WITH Kyoto  Cycy1384 : but china and india are not verywealthy   CXCross : But they are VERY polluting  CXCross : because they are not very wealthy  Cycy1384 : true but the fact is that we have to be an example   CXCross : Then have Europe be an example...nobody is stopping you  Cycy1384 : how can we critik polluting countries if we did  Cycy1384 : we are in late sure , but we are doing our maximum and it works lol  CXCross : So then you're setting a fine example...and once you get China and India on board and can ensure that our standard of living will remain comparable after implementing Kyoto--we'll sign on  CXCross : and that it won't place such a large dent in our economy...  Cycy1384 : so the superpower of the world will try to not pollute only when poor countries will be more wealthy?  Cycy1384 : BUT u 're only talking about economy, economy is not all yet nah?  CXCross : Eh, it's a biggie. But suppose the US completely eliminates its pollution--that won't make one difference for countries like India and China--who will continue to pollute as much as they want  CXCross : Basicaly, there's not a good enough reason for the US to sign on to Kyoto.  Cycy1384 : yeah but u 'll able to impose ur way   CXCross : How?  Cycy1384 : because u stop polluting , u ARE the superpower   Cycy1384 : all other powers are trying to stop polluting  Cycy1384 : so that's pression   CXCross : Not China or India  Cycy1384 : china against the rest of the world , they will lose  CXCross : Our stopping polluting doesn't change how they act at all  CXCross : Lose what?  CXCross : What do they lose?  Cycy1384 : but the us is poluting more than china yet   Cycy1384 : they will lose the fact of poluting , they will be force to stop that  Cycy1384 : because of the superpower stop , other powers stop  CXCross : True--but out economy is also much much larger--we produce much more and in comparison to the size of our ecnonomy--we produce not that much pollution  CXCross : China is a superpower...why will they stop?  Cycy1384 : china is not   Cycy1384 : well not again lol  CXCross : Why will they be forced to stop polluting?  Cycy1384 : here we are afraid of china more than america lol  CXCross : If they haven't signed on to Kyoto--why will they be forced to stop polluting  CXCross : (as you should be)  Cycy1384 : because of the rest of the wealthy world will force them doing it   Cycy1384 : if everyone stop poluting   CXCross : How?  Cycy1384 : they will be force  CXCross : As in, war?  Cycy1384 : nahhhhh   Cycy1384 : already the war lol  CXCross : What kind of force then?  Cycy1384 : dont be so extremist lol  Cycy1384 : spiritual force   CXCross : ...  Cycy1384 : then political force  CXCross : What the hell is "spiritual force"?  Cycy1384 : then we can conclude a treaty   Cycy1384 : lmao lol   CXCross : Why would they sign the treaty? What are they being threatened with?  Cycy1384 : spiritual force is the meaning of everyone know that's bad  CXCross : Yeah but so what?  Cycy1384 : people can become demonstrator   Cycy1384 : and we will help demonstrator  CXCross : Suppose China says "we don't care what you think"  CXCross : Then what?  Cycy1384 : then we can stop buying all things from china   Cycy1384 : economic blocus is possible  CXCross : No we can't--they produce too many goods  Cycy1384 : china is really dependant  CXCross : As are Western countries on China  Cycy1384 : humm not really   CXCross : you can't boycott china  Cycy1384 : japan is dependant of nothing   Cycy1384 : europe is military dependant of america   CXCross : And their economy is in the shitter  CXCross : (japan's)  Cycy1384 : the usa is dependant of the world lol  Cycy1384 : japan is not that well cause they are changing their ways   CXCross : No, they've been this way for the past decade  Cycy1384 : but that a real good example of a regulated crisis  Cycy1384 : oh u know what it was a long time i never have fun talking to an american wow that's so rare   Cycy1384 : i have to remercier u lol  CXCross : likewise  Cycy1384 : even if some expressions are still a mystery for me lol  There you have it...take it for what you will.

       DODGER STUFF .  Dodgers are playing great ball lately--today's  urlLink 8th inning fiasco in Pittsburgh  notwithstanding--they're finding ways to win and getting support from fairly unlikely sources (Alvarez' start, Saenz today)--but how precarious is the Blue?  Specifically--both Beltre and Bradley are greatly favoring their respective injuries--both are producing despite this--but their limps are becoming fairly noticeable (Bradley was grimacing during his HR trot today and Beltre looks like a gimp on any 2B)  So here's the question--are the Dodgers' just one injury away from having some serious problems?

       WHEN "SORRY" ISN'T ENOUGH.   WaPo editorial board is calling Rumsfeld's accepting of full and complete responsibility for the abuses in Iraq  urlLink An Inadequate Response .    But whether or not he remains in office, the most important task before the administration and Congress should be to reform the system of prisoner detention so that it fully conforms to the Geneva Conventions and other international standards of human rights. That will require changes in procedures, the formulation of clear standards and rigorous outside oversight.     This wrongly assumes that the GC is more protective of prisoner rights than regular US procedures.  If the problem is enforcement, then it wouldn't matter WHAT convention/body of law you follow as it won't be enforced.  That being said, assuming the problem IS enforcement, the very fact that the this problem was "outed" by a fellow serviceman, that the DOD responded almost immediately with investigating the charges and a fairly giant-sized report on the matter kind of gives the lie to the notion that these abuses are either a policy of the DOD or an unavoidable consequence of DOD policy.  What does this all mean? Well, that's it's 2am and I should be outlining Corporations right about now.

He quotes the NYT:   Ms. Cutler has taken what, for generations of young women who have become involved with the powerful, has been the next logical step. She has become a writer. Yesterday she sold a novel based on her exploits to HyperionDisney (Walt). Her agent, Michael Carlisle of Carlisle & Company, said the price was "a substantial six figures," and Hyperion would not be more specific. Not only did he sell her novel, he said, but she will also pose nude for the November issue of Playboy.   Well, at least someone in this fiasco is  urlLink getting paid .

      On  urlLink Special Report  today, the topic turned to how the administration should respond to  urlLink France's obstinancy  regarding NATO/Turkey/Afghanistan/Iraq/common decency.  The general consensus was, as the admin has been doing, to  urlLink play up the positive .  But as a political matter, I'm not sure that's wise.  France is intransigent, they will not help us lest we start shouting " Achtung !" at them.  Further, given that Kerry has placed so much of his criticism of Bush on the President's alleged inability to "internationalize" his foreign policy or to not confer enough with "traditional allies"--it seems to me that Kerry is quite vulnerable here.  My gut tells me that most Americans don't really care for France.  As such, the Bush admin should make public its disagreements with Chirac over Afghanistan/Iraq and then proceed to outline all the craptacular statements and positions Chirac has taken over the past couple years.    This FORCES the press to ask Kerry his reaction to it--here Kerry is stuck.  Does he side with an adversarial France and further cement his image as a patrician Euro-weenie or does he abandon one of his main talking points against Bush and rebuke France (a "traditional ally")?

      What a strange headline from Reuters (strange or consistent, you decide):  urlLink Army Expects Further Involuntary Troop Call-Up .  Conjurs images of draft riots and conscription doesn't it? Well, ease up on the reins there Tonto:   "I would think that there's going to be soldiers who, yes, will be shocked. But I would say that the majority of the soldiers in the IRR today understand that they are in the Army," Col. Debra Cook, head of the Army's Human Resources Command, told a briefing.    Though I'm confused by this:   Soldiers will be given an opportunity to come up Army standards but if they fall short "they will be returned to their civilian status. We will not send untrained, unready soldiers to the theater," said Bernard Oliphant of the Army Mobilization Division.    That seems to provide SOME incentive to start eating a lot of fried foods and Krispy Kremes to fall OUT of shape--I would presume there's some penalty (even if fairly light) for failing to maintain your eligibility--even if you are on IRR.    Maybe I'm wrong--anybody know what's up?

      Zygote Design bemoans what he sees as the  urlLink death of civil political discourse in American politics  and asks:  When did, “I disagree with the war in Iraq and I think the current administration has sacrificed lives needlessly in a conflict that wasn’t justified” suddenly become not good enough?  Firstly, when it comes to civility, things could be  urlLink much worse --but I get the general point.  But I think it has to do with the fact that,    “I disagree with the war in Iraq and I think the current administration has sacrificed lives needlessly in a conflict that wasn’t justified”  became quite literally, not good enough.  It didn't make political headway.  It wasn't working.  So if reasoned discourse objection to the "distinguished gentleman from X"'s policy doesn't actually succeed--the options left are to (1) concede or (2) go nuclear  If people don’t think your opponent is wrong–maybe you can convince them he’s operating from nefarious or otherwise evil motivations.   After all, it’s a lot easier to object to someone if they are a total scumbag. If they just disagree but you both share the same basic values/moral norms--then you might ACTUALLY have to have a discussion/argument/debate with them...and that ain't likely to occur these days.

      With news that  urlLink Iraq will charge Saddam with war crimes , I am wondering how the media will cover the proceedings.  I see several options as possible--dependent on a couple things.  (1) The indictment will be covered somewhat sparingly with very little elaboration or detailed analysis--since well, we all KNOW that Saddam was a bad guy. (just  urlLink "not enough"  of one) And we don't need to be REMINDED of that uncomfortable fact.  (2) The trial coverage will depend on its timing.  From NYT:   How soon the trials of the 12 will begin remained uncertain; Dr. Allawi said Mr. Hussein's would not begin "for a number of months."   If it's BEFORE the US election--it will get far less coverage than if it happens after the election.  However, if the trial occurs before November, it still may get a decent amount of coverage IF it's laden with all sorts of gruesome photos and videos (though if they are TOO gruesome, the media can claim they don't want to be "excessive" in their coverage--as they interview Michael Jackson's former pool cleaner's ex-roommate's cousin)  (3) The main mitigating factor (aside from press bias against broadcasting much of anything that might redound to Bush's benefit) in the level of coverage of Saddam's trial will be the fact that the trial will be in ARABIC.  You can't have wall-to-wall coverage with nothing but monotone translators screwing up every fifth word.  So we will likely see far less coverage proportionally of the Saddam trial than we do of the Peterson or Kobe trials.  And (4) I may well be talking out of my ass--but this is how I see things stacking up: I see the news nets giving it about 60% of the coverage they are currently giving other high profile cases with and upside of about 80% depending on the salaciousness of the details and a downside of about 35% depending on the political ramifications (i.e. good for Bush) and language barriers.

      PJ O'Rourke has a piece in the Atlantic on the  urlLink echo chamber quality of conservative talk radio . On the right:   I tried watching The O'Reilly Factor. I tried watching Hannity shout about Colmes. I tried listening to conservative talk radio. But my frustration at concurrence would build, mounting from exasperation with like-mindedness to a fury of accord, and I'd hit the OFF button.   On the left:   NPR seems more whiny than hectoring, except at fundraising time. There's supposed to be a lot of liberal advocacy on TV. I looked for things that debased freedom, promoted license, ridiculed responsibility, and denigrated man and God—but that was all of TV.  His conclusion?   Arguing, in the sense of attempting to convince others, seems to have gone out of fashion with everyone. I'm reduced to arguing with the radio. The distaste for political argument certainly hasn't made politics friendlier—or quieter, given the amount of shouting being done by people who think one thing at people who think the same thing.   I bring this up because I saw much of the same thing in the movie theatre today watching  F9/11 .  The vast majority of people there weren't there to hear an argument or be persuaded--they were there to have their already existing notions about Bush (stupid yet cunningly evil genius beholden to Saudi interests when he's not bombing their clients) reinforced.    The film was more Pavlovian (picture of dead baby followed immediately by picture of smirking President = booo! bad Bush!) than it was Madisonian.  Unfortunately, I think much of conservative talk radio follows a similar line of attack insofar as it eschews argument for reinforcement.   I live in Los Angeles, we get a lot of talk shows here--and most of the biggies too (Rush, Hannity, Savage, etc).  I listen almost exclusively to one station:  urlLink 870 KRLA .  Their lineup from 9am-5pm is the strongest in the city, IMO.  Featuring  urlLink Dennis Prager ,  urlLink Michael Medved , and  urlLink Hugh Hewitt .  Prager has a much better ethical handle on matters than most talk show hosts and his years of study of totalitarian regimes makes for interesting conversations--plus he's appropriately silly when he needs to be.  Medved I like because of his expansive knowledge of American history--though he SOMETIMES falls into the conservative talk trap of giving too much airtime to really minor points and conflating it to all liberalism.  Hewitt is by far the best talk show host in Los Angeles--he brings the law professor's Socratic method to the political sphere and also has his finger on the pulse of the blogosphere probably more than any other talk show host.  Contrast these three with  urlLink Rush ,  urlLink Hannity , or  urlLink Savage .    Rush is good for political analysis on occasion--but from my listening to him, he so rarely entertains opposing calls that it really IS an echo chamber.    Hannity is just awful. Every caricature the left can make about a conservative responding to every challenge with "Why do you hate America?" fits wth Hannity.  And Savage...oh good god. Savage I can't stand for more than 10 minutes at a time.  Since once those 10 minutes are up, I've hear "you commie pinko scum, you slime, you dirtbag!" at least 12 times such that I know I can thankfully avoid the next 3 hours of programming.  The point of all this? Listen to  urlLink Hugh Hewitt !

      J.D. over at Evolution points to a  urlLink nifty article covereing some of Kansas' very interesting Civil War History .  Personally, I've always been fascinated by the Western theatre of the ACW, especially the fact that prior to formal war being declared, Americans were so willing to do unspeakable acts of brutatlity against one another (including the fairly odious and crazy  urlLink John Brown ) For  urlLink example :   At the Doyle farm, James and two of his sons, William and Drury, were dragged outside and hacked up with short, heavy sabres donated to Brown in Akron, Ohio. Mrs. Doyle, a daughter, and fourteen year old John were spared. The gang then moved on to Allen Wilkinson's place. He was 'taken prisoner' amid the cries of a sick wife and two children. Two saddles and a rifle were apparently confiscated. The third house visited that night was owned by James Harris. In addition to his wife and young child, Harris had three other men sleeping there. Only one of them, William Sherman, was executed. Weapons, a saddle, and a horse were confiscated from the house. While members of the rifle company, including four of Brown's sons, asserted that their Captain did not commit any of the actual murders himself, he was the undisputed leader and made the decisions as to who should be spared.   Helpful to remember stuff like that next time people complain of the "lack of civility" in this country.

      From the RAND Corp comes this study of some of the  urlLink myriad of problems facing that Communist paradise--Cuba :  The Castro regime reverted to its totalitarian impulses in March 2003. In sentencing 75 dissidents, independent journalists, and other activists to prison terms ranging from 6 to 28 years, it decapitated an emerging civil society of its potential leadership. Together with Castro’s practice of caudilloism, this legacy of totalitarianism will leave post-Castro Cuba without the rule of law and other requisites needed to restrain the power of the state, promote a market economy, and foster civil-society organizations that help sustain democracy.   Alienated Youth  Castro’s Revolution has drawn much support from the young, and the regime has looked to Cuba’s youth as the future promise of the Revolution. But relations between the state and Cuba’s youth deteriorated throughout the 1990s, as the young faced new levels of austerity, few opportunities for upward mobility, and a host of unfulfilled aspirations. The result has been a disaffected youth, whose retreat from politics may pose problems for not only a successor communist regime but also a democratically oriented one, because each would lack support from this pivotal, alienated sector.   A Festering Racial Divide  After much progress toward erasing racial inequalities, race-based discrimination and inequalities rose sharply in the 1990s. While most Cubans have suffered from the Special Period’s austerity, Afro-Cubans — especially blacks — have fared the worst. Heavily concentrated in the island’s poorest easternmost provinces, Afro-Cubans have benefited less from tourism and the other activities of the new economy. Compared with whites, Afro-Cubans receive fewer dollar remittances from abroad, are less likely to be small peasant farmers able to sell surplus produce for hard currency, and largely are excluded from lucrative tourist sector jobs. Any successor government will have to better the lot of Afro-Cubans substantially to retain the support they historically have provided to Castro.   An Emerging Demographic Bind  In contrast to its living standards, which are more typical of less-developed countries, Cuba’s population structure resembles that of the high-income developed world. This contrast will pose a daunting challenge because Cuba’s population is rapidly aging just as the supply of young workers is shrinking.  Cuba’s population over the next two decades will decline by 22 percent in each of three age groups (0-4, 5-19, and 20-44), while its census of mature working-age individuals (45-64) and pensioners (65-plus) will jump 70 percent or more. This demographic squeeze between the pension and social service needs of a growing elderly population and a declining labor force will make it very difficult for Castro’s successors to continue to support the extensive social services that have historically been one of the real accomplishments of the Revolution.   As for their economy?    Deformed Economic Institutions and an Obsolete and Inefficient Sugar Industry  Faced with a severe economic contraction in the early 1990s, the Castro regime was compelled to enact a few limited economic reforms. But to transition into a global economy, any post-Castro government will need to go much further if it is to overcome systemic problems in the following four economic areas:  Unproductive labor. Cuba’s labor force is highly educated but unproductive, a situation exacerbated by the state’s commitment to full employment and to a national pay schedule. Despite the closure of 45 percent of the island’s most inefficient sugar mills in 2002, the Castro regime has kept the displaced workers on the state payroll. The national pay schedule has divorced workers’ wages from their productivity, a policy that has created disincentives among the labor force. The new regime will be faced with a long-term task of motivating workers anew through market incentives.  Repressed, deformed private sector. After 40-plus years of communism, Cuba’s labor force lacks the trained managers, accountants, auditors, bankers, insurers, and other professionals that a robust market economy requires. In 2001, there were only 150,000 micro-enterprises in Cuba, a number that had fallen by one-quarter from four years earlier.  Corrupt society and state. Corruption and favoritism are commonplace in Cuba. Most materials on the black market are stolen or misappropriated from state enterprises and warehouses. Inside deals between individuals and their government contacts are also commonplace.  Postponed economic restructuring. Cuba also suffers from a distorted industrial structure that is a legacy of its nearly three decades of economic dependence on the Soviet Union. During that period, Cuba concentrated on producing sugar, which it exported to the USSR at exorbitant prices, and relied on imports of Soviet oil at well below world market prices. Despite the restructuring of the sugar industry that began in 2002, production has plummeted, and a new government will be faced with further scaling down the industry, introducing efficiency measures, and developing a more balanced industrial structure.   urlLink Full PDF document here .

      Forget  urlLink Cortislim ...forget  urlLink Atkins .  I've dropped 12 pounds in the past 2 weeks with a remarkable new method: working out like a mofo. My workout history is a long and storied affair that I will proceed to bore the crap out of you with right now.  I'm 6'3".  Traditionally been fairly lanky--helped since I was a pitcher.  By the end of my first year of college, I was clocking in around 185-188.  Not that much muscle mass--but I could still pitch (2nd Team All Ivy-League with a 1.91 ERA thank you very much).  But I decided to drop a few pounds--so by the time my 2nd year started I had dropped down to 170.    Now I was REALLY a stick--but it helped since as part of our conditioning for the team we had to run 3 miles in 24 minutes ( did it in about 21:30).  While a nice guy, our strength-coach was a former Olympic powerlifter and had the curious idea that EVERYONE should also be an Olympic powerlifter--or at least train like one.  So in the fall of that year ('97), while doing some heavy lifting--I suffered a couple herniated discs in my back. Fun times.  4 days later I had back surgery.  The injury basically ended my baseball career as I suffered a pinched nerve in my right leg and lost a great deal of strength in my lower half.  I eventually did rehab and came back to pitch that year but I just didn't have it.  So baseball was done for me.  So since I still wanted to be active--I decided to focus on lifting.  And eating. And lifting. And eating. And lifting.  by the time I left Columbia I was clocking in at about 240 lbs with about 10% body fat. I was a big boy.  Well, once I got back to L.A. and didn't have those wonderful meal-plan points to spend--I soon dropped down to around 215-220.  I was eating lots of chicken and tuna.  Ever tried tuna straight out of the can? It's pretty nasty.  Yup, did that for about a year.  Following 2 years  urlLink trying to save money ,  urlLink law school  started. That and getting married to my lovely wife (who can cook) reduced my physical activity and increased my food intake.  So I finally weighed myself a few weeks ago and I was an embarassing 237.  That's just wrong.  So I had to crack down and after a couple of weeks I'm within my "fighting weight" at around 226 (body fat around 16%).  Granted, as the  urlLink US Army requires someone of my height/age to be around 220 , I have a long way to go (all things being equal--I'm hoping to sign up once I get my JD and pass the bar--I want to sue Kim Jong Il)   Now if I can only get my 2 mile time below 17:54--I'll be happy. Hey, anybody know how to remedy shin splints? I'm dyin' here.

       urlLink From the AP :   ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Bush said on Tuesday that Turkey belongs in the European Union and that Europe is "not the exclusive club of a single religion" in what amounted to a rejection of French President Jacques Chirac. In remarks prepared for delivery at a Istanbul university, Bush refused to back down in the face of Chirac's criticism on Monday that Bush had no business urging the EU to set a date for Turkey to start entry talks into the union.  "America believes that as a European power, Turkey belongs in the European Union," Bush said.  Not sure how I feel about this--given the lengths Turkey went to deny the US a northern front in the war, I'm a little hesitant to see my president going out of his way to promote their admission into the EU.  Of course, that he's doing this as a rebuke to France (far LESS an ally than even Turkey) makes me feel better about it.

      Was watching FOXNews this morning and David Asman was interviewing Richard Holbrooke, former ambassador and current adviser to John Kerry.  At the end of the interview, Asman asked Holbrooke what  urlLink John Kerry's plan  was for Iraq--specifically places like Fallujah because, in Asman's words, people will have to know the difference if they are to make a choice.  Holbrooke kind of dodged and said that Kerry had outlined his plan in 4 urlLink  speeches .  Asman: "But it can't be summarized here?" Holbrooke: "Not on television with it's bizarre soundbite problems."  So lemme get this straight--John Kerry's plan for Iraq is TOO COMPLICATED/nuanced to be summarized on TELEVISION?  That might prove problematic come the debates.

But I will note the one undeniable benefit of the movie's success.  It provides a handy refernce to the intelligence of the person who sees it.  If you encounter anyone speaking in tones even remotely approaching respect for the movie, you have proof positive that the speaker is a fool, not to be trusted on any point, for he or she has given testimony as to their ignorance of basic facts and of an inability to detect even elephant-sized inconsitencies in argument and story line.

       urlLink Reuters reports:   BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The formal handover of sovereignty to an interim Iraqi government has been brought forward two days to today, a coalition source says.  The U.S.-led coalition had initially been expected to hand over to an interim Iraqi government on June 30.  In Istanbul, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari confirmed on Monday there were plans to bring the handover forward.   Ok, why early?  Here's my initial gut thought--everyone has been predicting that there would be a spate of violence on June 30 in attempts to mar the handover of sovereignty to Iraq.  So by moving things forward and doing this "surprise" handover--the CPA and Iraqi gov't do an end run around the terrorists and kind of prevent terrorists from getting all the publicity and disruptions they crave.  This isn't to say that the attacks won't still happen--but it will look much different when these foreign fighters are attacking an established IRAQI gov't rather than an apparent cherry-picked US gov't.

       urlLink Gunmen threaten to execute kidnapped US marine    Militants have kidnapped a US Marine and a Pakistani driver in Iraq and are threatening to behead them unless Iraqi prisoners are freed, Arab television reported today.  The kidnappings, apparently carried out by two different groups, are the latest targeting foreigners in Iraq in the violent run-up to June 30, when an interim Iraqi government is set to formally take over from the US-led occupation authorities.  Al-Jazeera television said a group calling itself the Islamic Response Movement, the security wing of the "1920 Revolution Brigades", had kidnapped a US Marine after luring him from a US base.  Today's brief video showed a blindfolded man dressed in camouflage sitting in a chair with a hand holding a sword above his head. A Marine Corps identity card named him as Wassef Ali Hassoun and al-Jazeera said he was of Pakistani origin. Other official documents also displayed his name.  There was no immediate comment from the US military in Baghdad. Jazeera said the group threatened to behead Hassoun if their demands were not met but did not set a deadline.   urlLink AP reports  that Al Jazeera broadcast a videotape of the kidnapped marine.

      Ok, Moore's film set  urlLink all sorts of records  in its opening weekend after going up against such quality films as  urlLink Dodgeball  and  urlLink White Chicks .  But amidst all the hype surrounding Moore's film, something seems to be lost in the analysis that will dramtically affect Moore's box-office take.   urlLink Spiderman 2  opens this Wednesday.  The two films are trying to get the bulk of their gross from the same  urlLink demographic   (weed plays a factor)--this is evident from how hard Moore/Miramax fought to avoid an R rating.  But the people seeing Moore's film fall into two basic camps--the fellow-travelers who already KNEW the Afghan war was about oil/Cheney/Skull & Bones and those that had nothing better to see on a Friday and saw  F9/11  because of the controversy surrounding it.  The former group already hates Bush--the latter don't follow politics all that much and (assuming they vote at all) whatever opinions they have forced into them from Moore's film will be quickly forgotten once the web-slinging Spiderman hits theatres.  They'll vaguely remember the film around November as saying "Bush was a bad dude"--sentiments they already had from their exposure to mainstream media.  In short, Moore's blown his load in his opening weekend and this very expensive "unseat Bush" effort will ultimately amount to not much once Spidey and Dr. Octo start blowing things up.

       urlLink UK Telegraph: Families of 9/11 are 'the rock stars of grief' says sister of Pentagon pilot   Among the activist leaders of 9/11 families' groups it is safe to say that Debra Burlingame - whose brother, Charles, was the pilot of the plane that crashed into the Pentagon - is not a uniformly popular figure.   Ms Burlingame, a staunch Democrat, has become the first public 9/11 "dissident" - a vocal critic of the "blame game" being played over the al-Qaeda attacks - and an unlikely defender of George W Bush. For good measure, the outspoken former lawyer describes some of the bereaved 9/11 families as America's "rock stars of grief".  ***  With anger mounting among the relatives of victims, the 9/11 Commission, made up of both Republican and Democratic Congressmen, was formed; it will report next month. After hearing evidence given in the commission's recent hearings, the four New Jersey women have made countless appearances in the national media, accusing various federal agencies, agents and the White House of hopeless incompetence.  Ms Burlingame, though, begs to differ. In blistering attacks last week on the 9/11 Commission and those who lobbied for it, she described the high-level hearings as a "Beltway soap opera - awash in politics and finger-pointing". Even more provocatively, in an article published in the Wall Street Journal, Ms Burlingame accuses prominent 9/11 activists of holding an unjustified "contempt for all the people whom they feel contributed to a loss of life on the day their loved ones didn't come home".  For good measure, she also states that the 9/11 families "are not a monolithic group that speaks with one voice". The activist organisations, she says, have been indulged too much. Standing by a memorial in Manhattan to the September 11 victims, with her back to Ground Zero, Ms Burlingame says: "I first felt the need to speak out when 'The Families of September 11' group protested against the use of images of Ground Zero in Bush campaign advertisements. The idea that relatives of victims 'own' September 11 and its images, and can give or withhold permission to use them, is frankly ridiculous.  "People held back from criticising the relatives because of who they were. But what's happening is that this prominent group of activists have become the rock stars of grief in this country. I think people are getting sick of them because they are being so demanding. I can say it because I'm a relative too."  When you have such a therapeutic culture such as ours that values, and thrives on, victimhood far more than most other qualities--that such activists have attained such pseudo-celebrity status is depressing, though not surprising.

       urlLink Stephen Taylor of Poliblog  finds the  urlLink Alliance of Digital Brownshirts  "too creepy to be funny" and suggests that Nazis are only funny in Mel Brooks musicals (though why Hogan's Heroes doesn't qualify, I don't know)  While I get his general argument, I ultimately disagree.  It would be one thing if the ADB just kind of formed out of thin air--which would indicate SOME independent affinity for the concept of brownshirts and Nazi imagery.  But in this case, Al Gore made such a baseless and patently stupid analogy that to embrace it as some bloggers have done merely underscores the ridiculousness of it.  Basicaly, in comparing bloggers/conservative pundits/etc to Nazis, Gore set such a LOW standard for what qualifies as being a jackbooted thug that to embrace the imagery in an ironic way poses no problem and merely exposes people that make such facially absurd analogies to be the tools they are.  (Kind of like an inverted  Le Monde  headline: "We are all Hitler now"  After all, if everything (at least in Gore's fevered little Homer Simpson Treehouse of Horror "The Shinning" mind) on the other side of the spectrum qualifies as being equivalent to Nazism, well, you certainly can't ARGUE your way out of that--better to just have a little Photoshop fun and make light of it.  SIDENOTE: And to prove that Nazis can be funny outside of Mel Brooks musicals:  One day me and some law school guys were playing basketball, somebody makes some offhand and totally inoffensive remark about WWII...  Me: "Hey fuck you man, my grandpa died at Auschwitz." *awkward silence* *awkward silence* *awkward silence* *awkward silence* *awkward silence* *awkward silence* Me: "Yeah, he fell off the guard tower."

       urlLink NYT: Iraqis, Seeking Foes of Saudis, Contacted bin Laden, File Says .    The document states that Iraq agreed to rebroadcast anti-Saudi propaganda, and that a request from Mr. bin Laden to begin joint operations against foreign forces in Saudi Arabia went unanswered. There is no further indication of collaboration.  *** The document, which asserts that Mr. bin Laden "was approached by our side," states that Mr. bin Laden previously "had some reservations about being labeled an Iraqi operative," but was now willing to meet in Sudan, and that "presidential approval" was granted to the Iraqi security service to proceed.   So I'm clear on this whole thing:  (1) Iraq has made, at various times, several contacts and attempts at further cooperation with bin Laden/al Qaeda (2) al Qaeda has made, at various times, several contacts and attempts at further cooperation with Iraq. (3) They just seemed to be unable to agree on the details.  It reminds me of when two people like each other but can't quite get together because they're both "sort of seeing someone else" at the moment--but the attraction is still there.  Forgive me for not being too inclined to sit and wait for Iraq and UBL to finally decide to "go steady" after flirting with each other for so long.

      Last paragraph of Howard's brief  urlLink War in European History :   One may feel some gratification that, after a thousand years of armed conflict within Europe, a society has developed which feels itself sufficiently secure to turn its back on the traditional military virtues; but this must be tempered by apprehension that, in a world so heterogeneous and unpredictable as that in which we live, such confidence may prove premature.  Nothing has occurred since 1945 to indicate that war, or the threat of it, could not still be an effective instrument of state policy.  Against peoples who were not prepared to defend themselves it might be very effective indeed.   Quick review of the book, I enjoyed it. It was basically a quick little overview of the development of war across the pond from feudal lords and their knights to mercenaries to princelings to merchants to "nations" to technologists to the nuclear age.  Sometimes new technology and weaponry change the face of warfare--sometimes the fighting spirit of a people is sufficient.  Howard writes that it's something of a give and take.  In particular, he notes that Europe has gone from the more limited warfare of maneuver to the all out frontal charges of Napoleonic wars to the relative piece and smallish wars until the total wars of WWI and WWII--and he argues that in the nuclear age, it's back to a more limited type of conflict since the whole of the populace isn't as invested in the war effort as was Napoleonic France or the Allies/Axis of WWII--and it's that sort of "specialization" and ultimate lack of overt conflict that was leading (and IMO, has led) Europe to its approach towards military matters today.

       urlLink Court strikes down NY's death penalty   ALBANY, N.Y. -- The state Court of Appeals has overturned the death sentence of Stephen LaValle and, in the process, has invalidated the state's death penalty.  The court, in a 4-3 decision, ruled that the law's deadlock instruction violates the state constitution. The law requires juries to be told that if they cannot unanimously agree on a sentence of death or life without parole, the defendant will receive a sentence that includes the possibility of parole. The court said that instruction could coerce jurors into imposing a death sentence they felt was inappropriate to prevent the defendant from ever being freed.   Until the state legislature fixes this instruction, the court said the death penalty may not be imposed. The decision did not address the fate of the remaining three men on Death Row -- Robert Shulman and Nicholson McCoy from Suffolk and John Taylor from Queens -- but legal observers said they expect those death sentences to be thrown out, as well.

      That's what both Arnold and  urlLink BoiFromTroy  want.  Boi writes:   A GOP Convention with Schwarzenegger headlining--rather than Tom DeLay, for example--would go a long way towards easing reservations that financial-freedom and personal freedom-loving moderates like myself have developed recently.   I'd argue the benefits from having Arnold speaking aren't nearly so narrow.  Whatever reservations moderates like Boi may have re: "financial freedom and personal freedom" certainly won't be met by the Democratic party--so having the GOP go out of its way to appeal to those moderates (who, IMO, are just as set in who they're going to vote for than the swing voters who have yet to start paying attention) won't produce much appreciable benefit.  Were this 1996 again, then yes, such a "fiscal responsibility" approach could be the focus of an Arnold speech and it'd play well since we, as a country, didn't have a whole heck of a lot to worry about (mostly through our own negligence) beyond how much to fund HeadStart.  The 'sitch is a little different now and there are larger concerns.  Mind you, not that curbing sending isn't important--but the war is what matters--and it's ALL that matters.  That being said--Arnold should still get a whole heapload of prime time space to speak--since it really doesn't matter what the heck he says. Seriously, he could go out there and read his grocery list (lots of chicken and egg whites I bet) and it'd give Bush a big boost.

      Conventional wisdom (which has a remarkable track record of being wrong lately) tells that Bush is the leading cause of the divisiveness and hyper-partisan nature of the DC discourse.

      I'm in the middle of Michael Howard's brief  urlLink War in European History .  It's a short little book, but well written and interesting. I read parts of it in college, and just decided to read it in full.  In discussing late 15th/early 16th century warfare, Howard pens this line, which I liked:  All this--the spread of fortification, the ascendancy of the defensive on the battlefield, the expense of mercenary troops and the professional caution of their leaders--explain why, for over a hundred years, warfare in Europe was so prolonged and so indecisive; smouldering away like wet wood, inflicting continuous damage on the countryside like some chronic disease to which the patient had philosophically if miserably resigned himself, never acting as a catalyst establishing a new pattern of politic order.  Part of me wants to resist drawing a modern parallel--but this is a blog, I can't let any analogy go untested--no matter how dumb.  But this statements seems to typify the state of affairs in much of the Mid East right now--cultures so locked into a cycle that nobody will win/nothing will be decided short of a epochal event that can serve to change the course and tenor of the existing state of affairs.    For Howard, that event (admittedly not a singular event, but more of a process)--was the development of the gun--which reduced the effectiveness of the cavalry as well as the Swiss pikemen and the usefulness of fortifications as the prime locus of state power--thereby causing states to look to the sea and trade to increase their wealth/power.    Anyway, back to my bad analogy--I'm inclined to think that the war in Iraq is just such an epochal event.  It, far more than any other war in the region in recent memory, has the potential to completely alter the framework in which states in the region deal/perceive/interact with one another.  No longer will it be "all against the West and Israel"--Iraq is the X factor, the variable.  That dramatically reduces the power of the mullahs, the Assads, etc--since their citizenry can now look to Iraq and see "another way" that was heretofore denied them as being nothing more than a Zionist plot.  I think that's kinda cool.

      From  urlLink Reuters .    The bill, due to be submitted to parliament in July, aims to change France's 1881 press law to punish insults based on sexual orientation, including comments against homosexuals as a group.  The bill would also punish incitement to discrimination, hate or violence on gender grounds. Feminists complained that offensive names for gays would be outlawed while women could be called "whores" or "sluts" with impunity.  ***  A feminist group called "Chiennes de garde" (Guard Bitches) said it would be dangerous "to send a signal that it is less serious to insult a woman because of her sex than to insult people because of their sexual orientation."  "Calling someone a dirty dyke or a fag would become a serious insult in legal terms while there would be no punishment for calling someone a whore or a slut," it wrote in a statement published in the daily Le Monde.  But fear not free speech advocates, your right to call someone a "dirty fucking Jew-bastard" is alive and well in gay Paris.

      I just finished Stephen Hayes'  urlLink The Connection : How al Qaeda's Collaboration with Saddam Hussein Has Endangered America .  My initial reactions are  urlLink here  (at the end of the post).  My overall grade: B/B+.  As I said earlier, it's well written, clear, and Hayes does a good job of helping the reader keep straight some of the more similar sounding Arab names.    The book relies heavily on what's now known as the  urlLink "Feith memo" --though it does not rely on it exlclusively--it does make up a bulk of the claims that support the book's thesis.  The Feith memo (and Hayes' reporting/reading of it) has been  urlLink criticized --Hayes answers the majority of them in the book--as well as  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .    Hayes is careful to note that much of what he is reporting might well turn out to be false--he is appropriately skeptical and does a good job of noting that intelligence officials sometimes differed over the value/importance of the intelligence he writes about.  The book does a better job at its job of convincing the reader of a plausible connection because of this--to Hayes' credit.  Each claim/report cited (though without footnotes--which kind of bugs) in the book should be read with a certain amount of skepticism.  Not cynicism--skepticism.  I found the book's thesis all the more powerful if I asked myself: "This may not be true/reliable, but if it  is , what should the response be?"  With that in mind Hayes' point becomes clear (it was clear before, but so much of it got lost in the panty-bunching that accompanied the response to the TITLE of the initial Weekly Standard article "Case Closed"--people went batshit crazy assuming that Hayes was reporting that OBL and Saddam were like  urlLink Tom Hanks and Peter Scolari .    They were not, nor does Hayes make the claim.  Instead he presents the frighteningly plausible notion that despite their initial ideological differences--both Saddam and bin Laden have at various times made overtures to each other (and in some cases, reached agreements).  Given this--would it have been wise to leave an Iraq headed by a ruler willing (however reluctantly) to ally with UBL for the purposes of attacking America?  It's a brave man who can answer that question in the affirmative.  As for things I didn't like about the book--as I said, it relies on the Feith memo a great deal--which is always problematic when an author or reporter relies on single sources disproportionately.  His lack of footnotes or an index is also annoying--though forgiveable.  He state early on that since much of what he is reporting is from classified information and other intelligence information--he can't cite to it.  But where such information is available through an open source--he cites to that source.  Whether he cites to ENOUGH open sources--I can't say.  But if he's to be criticized for anything--that would be it.  An index would have also been nice since while it's a short book (186 pages)--lots of the names repeat or are similar sounding and a little bit of guidance or reference would've been helpful.  Again, all in all I liked the book and I think it raised several important questions that should be examined further before people simply write off the Iraq/Al Qaeda connection as being some wacky neocon thing. After all, what if you're wrong?

       urlLink Court: If police ask, you must give your name .    US citizens do not enjoy a constitutional right to refuse to reveal their identity when requested by police. In what may become a major boost to US law enforcement and antiterrorism efforts, the US Supreme Court Monday upheld a Nevada law that makes it a criminal offense for anyone suspected of wrongdoing to refuse to identify himself to police. *** The 5-to-4 decision says that neither the Fourth Amendment's right to privacy nor the Fifth Amendment's guarantee against self-incrimination bars states from passing laws requiring citizens to identify themselves.  In effect, the majority justices say that in most cases it is no significant intrusion for police to request - and a suspect to provide - his name.  "One's identity is, by definition, unique; yet it is, in another sense, a universal characteristic," writes Justice Anthony Kennedy for the majority. "Answering a request to disclose a name is likely to be so insignificant in the scheme of things as to be incriminating only in unusual circumstances."  Justice Kennedy adds that if a case arises in which the furnished identity provides a key link leading to the conviction of the individual for a different crime, the court will revisit the issue.  Joining Justice Kennedy's majority opinion were Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas.    urlLink From the summary  re: the 4th Amendment   The Nevada statute is consistent with Fourth Amendment prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures because it properly balances the intrusion on the individual's interests against the promotion of legitimate government interests. See Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648, 654. An identity request has an immediate relation to the Terry stop's purpose, rationale, and practical demands, and the threat of criminal sanction helps ensure that the request does not become a legal nullity. On the other hand, the statute does not alter the nature of the stop itself, changing neither its duration nor its location.  Re: the 5th Amendment:   Hiibel's contention that his conviction violates the Fifth Amendment's prohibition on self-incrimination fails because disclosure of his name and identity presented no reasonable danger of incrimination. The Fifth Amendment prohibits only compelled testimony that is incriminating, see Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591, 598, and protects only against disclosures that the witness reasonably believes could be used in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used, Kastigar v. United States, 406 U. S. 441, 445. Hiibel's refusal to disclose was not based on any articulated real and appreciable fear that his name would be used to incriminate him, or that it would furnish evidence needed to prosecute him.   When I was in Criminal Procedure this past year I was marked the "So What" corner because every time my well-meaning but consistently left-leaning professor (a former PD from Baltimore) would breathlessly tell us what was so wrong and horrible about what the police in a given case had done, my hand would invariably shoot up and ask, "So what?"  When I heard of this case (  HIIBEL v. SIXTH JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT OF NEVADA  ), I had basically the same reaction.  I couldn't see how such a request could qualify as compelled testimony that was incriminating. Of course, I hadn't given it all that much thought, but I like to point out when I get the crap-shoot that is predicting SCOTUS opinions right.  UPDATE:  urlLink Volokh on the case .

      Been mulling this over for a bit (read: a day) and have come to the following conclusion:  I don't believe that John Kerry has any intention of "staying the course" in Iraq should he become president. I think his public statements are (shockingly) calculated to give him a defensible argument that his ultimate decision to pull out of Iraq is justified. Here's how I see Kerry's views:   (1) The war is not a legitimate exercise. (1a) The war was entered into under false pretenses & Bush lied/misled/etc us into war (2) The war in Iraq has NOT made us safer  (3) The war is NOT sufficiently (if at all) connected to the War on Terrorism.  From this, it's very easy to make a logically consistent argument justifying pulling out of Iraq.  After all, how could the pursuit of an illegitimate, costly, ill-conceived, and wrongheaded war EVER be in our national interest?  From this comes the position that it's NOT "cutting and running" to pull out of Iraq--but rather the ending of a fool's errand that never should have occurred in the first place.  And pulling out finally allows the country to get back to REALLY fighting terrorists as they should be fought--with subpoenas and indictments.  The counter argument is that Kerry's hand will be forced by events to stay in Iraq--that the pressure will simply be too great and he won't have much of a choice in the matter.  I don't buy it.  Will Kerry pull a Zapatero and pull all US forces out on Nov 5? No.  But he sure won't be itching to keep US forces in-country when UN blue-helmets could do a much better job of getting shot--and without that pesky political blowback that such events can have.  But I think that by being so overtly critical of the war and how it was handled and its wisdom, that Kerry's commitment to the endeavor can justifiably be called into question.

       urlLink The New Yorker on Farenheit 9/11 :   Moore can’t resist amusing his campus and conspiracy-nut following, along with the gleeful sophomore in all of us, but, as the man said, when you aim at the king you had better kill him. At the moment, the stakes may be too high for shenanigans. “Fahrenheit 9/11” offers the thrill of a coherent explanation for everything, but parts of the movie are no better than a wild, lunging grab at a supposed master plan. Did Bush, as Moore implies, allow Osama bin Laden to survive because of American financial ties to Osama’s protectors, the Taliban? (If so, the Pentagon war planners were part of the plot.) Moore is a genuine populist, but what he can’t deal with is the unpleasant possibility that Bush, as people used to say of Nixon, has made a shrewd assessment of the lack of virtue and curiosity in the American public. A lot of Americans still admire the ignorant, smirking, chest-out, crotch-forward triumphalism. Michael Moore has become a sensational entertainer of the already converted, but his enduring problem as a political artist is that he has never known how to change anyone’s politics.   Color me a fan of the ignorant, smirking, chest-out, crotch forward triumphalism. It tends to win wars.

      From  urlLink Editor & Publisher : The   Times editorial, titled "Show Us the Proof," said it was "surprised by the depth and ferocity of the administration's capacity for denial." It observed that what Cheney called "longstanding ties" between Saddam and bin Laden so far amount amounted "to one confirmed meeting, after which the Iraq government did not help Al Qaeda. By those standards, the United States has longstanding ties to North Korea." Cheney, as usual, the newspaper said, "is not prepared to offer any evidence beyond the flimsy-to-nonexistent arguments he has used in the past."  And in a shocking example of somebody letting a story through:  urlLink 9/11 Panel Chiefs Reiterate Position on Qaeda-Iraq Ties    Mr. Kean and Mr. Hamilton appeared to suggest that any differences over the issue were largely semantic.  "We have concluded there is no evidence that we can find whatsoever that Iraq or Saddam Hussein participated in any way in attacks on the United States," Mr. Kean said. "What we do say, however, is there were contacts."  Mr. Hamilton said he had looked at the statements "quite carefully" from the administration. "They are not claiming there was a collaborative relationship between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda with regard to the attacks on the United States," he said.  He later added that with regard to the administration's core statements, "I don't think there is a difference of opinion with regard to those statements."  On that note, I just started Stephen Hayes'  urlLink The Connection : How al Qaeda's Collaboration with Saddam Hussein Has Endangered America .  I'm about 1/4 of the way through it.  It's written well, Hayes' is appropriately skeptical and acknowledges that his information may well turn out to be wrong--but at this point it is something of an indictment of the press and by extension, the 9/11 commission that they have not investigated these contacts more vigorously.  Most notably, the strange tale of  urlLink Ahmed Hikmat Shakir  as well as the media's failure to investigate the 1992 IIS memo listing Osama as an Iraqi intelligence asset.  But as I said, I'm only about 1/4 through...

The former American president, famed for his amiable disposition, becomes visibly angry and rattled, particularly when Dimbleby asks him whether his publicly declared contrition over the affair is genuine.  His outrage at the line of questioning during the 50-minute interview, to be broadcast on Panorama on Tuesday night, lasts several minutes. It is the first time that the former President has been seen to lose his temper publicly over the issue of his sexual liaisons with Ms Lewinsky.  The President initially responds to Dimbleby's questions by launching a general attack on media intrusion. When the broadcaster persists with the question of whether the politician was truly penitent, Clinton directs his anger towards Dimbleby.  Couldn't resist the post title. Forgive me.

       urlLink      The Iraq connection long suggested by administration officials gained no currency in the report.  "Bin Laden is said to have requested space to establish training camps, as well as assistance in procuring weapons, but Iraq apparently never responded," the report said. "There have been reports that contacts between Iraq and Al Qaeda also occurred" after bin Laden moved his operations to Afghanistan in 1996, "but they do not appear to have resulted in a collaborative relationship," it said.  "Two senior bin Laden associates have adamantly denied that any ties existed between Al Qaeda and Iraq," the report said.  So let's get this straight, Iraqi agents/operatives/envoys and Al Qaeda had met as early as 1994 and  urlLink as late as 2000 , yet this signified not a "collaborative relationship."  Hmmm...ok.  Consider the following re: Mr. Ahmed Hakmit Shakir and his meeting in Kuala Lampur:   The meeting lasted for three days. Six days after September 11, Shakir was captured in Doha, Qatar. He had in his possession contact information for several senior al Qaeda terrorists: Zahid Sheikh Mohammed, brother of September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; Musab Yasin, brother of Abdul Rahman Yasin, the Iraqi who helped mix the chemicals for the first World Trade Center attack and was given safe haven upon his return to Baghdad; and Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, otherwise known as Abu Hajer al Iraqi, described by one top al Qaeda detainee as Osama bin Laden's "best friend."   Despite all of this, Shakir was released. On October 21, 2001, he boarded a plane for Baghdad, via Amman, Jordan. He never made the connection. Shakir was detained by Jordanian intelligence. Immediately following his capture, according to U.S. officials familiar with the intelligence on Shakir, the Iraqi government began exerting pressure on the Jordanians to release him. Some U.S. intelligence officials--primarily at the CIA--believed that Iraq's demand for Shakir's release was pro forma, no different from the requests governments regularly make on behalf of citizens detained by foreign governments. But others, pointing to the flurry of phone calls and personal appeals from the Iraqi government to the Jordanians, disagreed. This panicked reaction, they said, reflected an interest in Shakir at the highest levels of Saddam Hussein's regime.  CIA officials who interviewed Shakir in Jordan reported that he was generally uncooperative. But even in refusing to talk, he provided some important information: The interrogators concluded that his evasive answers reflected counterinterrogation techniques so sophisticated  that he had probably learned them from a government intelligence service. Shakir's Iraqi nationality, his contacts with the Iraqi embassy in Malaysia, the keen interest of Baghdad in his case, and now the appearance of his name on the rolls of Fedayeen officers--all this makes the Iraqi intelligence service the most likely source of his training.  So even assuming that Saddam was not handing Osama a bag with a big dollar sign on it--don't the meetings between AQ and Iraq, in both 1994 and 2000 suggest that Iraq was at least AWARE of Al Qaeda's plans to attack the US?    Further, doesn't the 2000 meeting suggest a specific foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks?  Wouldn't that present a fairly strong argument that Iraq was at some level complicit in the attacks insofar as they knew about them and did nothing--even if they didn't actively aid in their commission? One wonders if the 9/11 Commission's staff report mentioned (even if to refute) this facially relevant fact. I am inclined to doubt it.

      Justene over at  urlLink Calblog  has a problem with   urlLink pro per   plaintiffs who, despite the law not being on their side, still think they should prevail. Excerpt:   What bothered me most was the conversation outside the courtroom when the pro per, despite the judge taking at least 20 minutes to explain why the matter would be dismissed, said "I don't understand why your client is paying legal fees on this when they should just let me have what I want." I can't tell you what about this is more offensive -- the fact that the pro per not only thinks they are right but assumes I know it and am just opposing them to be difficult and unfair, or the fact that the pro per thinks that the legal fees are money that ought to go to them.    Notice how this penchant for "doing it yourself" doesn't apply to most other professions?  You rarely see folks deciding to pull an appendix on their own.  Rarely will they do their own taxes if they have an accountant friend to help.    So why is American law different? I'd argue it comes from the supremely democratic nature of our legal system.  Anyone (almost) can sue or be sued, and most laws are drafted and written in an English that, while certainly less than plain, is a good deal less proprietary than that of the medical profession.  This kind of turns everyone into an instant expert since we all have generally accepted definitions of the words in the statutes/cases and figure figure that the definitions can't vary THAT much from their accepted norms.  Further, so much of our history is filled with self-taught lawyers, Lincoln comes to mind first off (though I think Adams was as well)--and I think that ideal that any man can master the law and thereby defend his rights is deeply ingrained in the American spirit.  (but can you imagine someone just kind of winging it on the bar these days--now that's ballsy)  Is this a good thing? I don't really have a problem with it--makes for some interesting reading in law school and I don't believe it happens often enough to explain why I don't have an internship (though if the latter proves false, then I will be very much against people representing themselves).

Here's a brief description of the three main city areas in the game:    Los Santos : Populated by the rich and famous, as well as the down-and-out, Los Santos is Rockstar North's interpretation of modern-day Los Angeles. Movie stars and millionaire rich kids strut their stuff in expensive rides, while the less-savory individuals hang out in their ghetto homesteads, peddling death and destruction. CJ's home, family, and former gang resides in Los Santos, and its here that GTA: San Andreas kicks off for real.    San Fierro : Sources indicate that CJ will travel to the city of San Fierro after spending the first part of the game in his home city of Los Santos. San Fierro is based on San Francisco, so it's safe to assume that CJ might be in for a little bad weather. Look for a tight knit cityscape, and smaller, more foreboding suburbs.    Las Venturas : Just like our own loveable sin city Las Vegas, GTA: San Andreas' third main city is Las Venturas. A place where any fool with a few bucks can get rich gambling in the casinos, or a place where the rich and famous can go bust in the course of one evening, Las Venturas has something for everyone. It's also the third and final stop that we know of where CJ will get in on some action.   With the exception of Half Life 2--I'm looking forward to this game most of all.

      As some bloggers surely know, blogging often eats into what some have charitably called "a life."      Go outside? Hmph! There's a article by a undergraduate poli sci major on  urlLink counterpunch  that DEMANDS I engage in a point by point refutation of it and it will take me at least 2 hours! Outside be damned!   Well, for us bloggers that have significant others, blogging can sometimes lead to tension with our respective better halves: "I'll be there in a minute honey, let me just finish the 14,000 word essay on why France sucks."    For many a blogger, this only delays the inevitable...but fear not, I have found the solution to all married blogger's troubles:   urlLink Sex and the City - The Complete First Season    urlLink Sex and the City - The Complete Second Season    That's 30 episodes--approximately 15 hours worth of television--guaranteed to stifle all but the most adamant wives in their criticism that you spend too much time blogging.  And now, a testimonial on the wonders of this discovery:    I love it! Not only can I blog in peace, since I can hear the TV, I can run into TV room and almost be guaranteed to see boobs! --Chris, Los Angeles.

       urlLink Supreme Court Dismisses Pledge Case on Standing Grounds .   In a ruling that, coincidentally, was issued on Flag Day -- and on the 50th anniversary of the addition by Congress of the words "under God" to the pledge -- the justices voted 8-0 to overturn a ruling two years ago by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the pledge was unconstitutional in public schools because it violated the separation of church and state. Justice Antonin Scalia did not participate in the case.   Five of the justices voted against the 9th Circuit's ruling on the grounds that Michael Newdow, the California atheist who filed suit to ban the pledge from his daughter's school, did not have the legal standing to speak for the girl because he did not have sufficient custody to qualify as her legal representative. The girl, who is in elementary school, was not named in the case.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and two other justices -- Sandra Day O'Connor and Clarence Thomas -- agreed that the lower court's ruling should be overturned, but not on the standing issue. Instead, they argued that the words "under God" in the pledge do not violate the Constitution.

      BSK, one of  urlLink BoiFromTroy's  guestbloggers, pens a screed that demands attention for its inanity. (Permalinks are twitchy--here's a  urlLink link  to the post immediately following the one in question, scroll down to "Vive la Liberté")  The discussion undoubtedly centered around the quagmire that is Iraq; a war that I was never in favour of. My fellow tablemates were a little surprised with my dissent, and even more shocked with my vividly poignant remark, “the actions of the American government are not necessarily endorsed by the whole of the American people.”   This is undoubtedly true--but then again, no democratic system I am aware of requires UNANIMITY. (Wait, there was the Articles of Confederation--that worked out swimmingly)  My Canadian counterpart said in jest, “It’s a good thing you’re in a free nation,” referring to my having said those words in Canada as supposed to the United States.  Yes, because clearly had the comment been made in Buffalo, black helicopters and jackbooted Ashcroftian thugs would have kicked down the door of the local Coffee Bean to haul off our resident Solzhenitsyn.  I grimaced for a moment, but it was painfully obvious that his statement was far from being tenuous.  Tenuous? More like  urlLink tendentious , or better yet,  urlLink fatuous .   For a time, it seemed dissent had taken a certain and unconscionable turn toward being labeled unpatriotic and worse, un-American.   Aside from trying to figure out the different between being unpatriotic and being un-American in the given context--any remotely cursory glance of the landscape even following 9/11 shows that  urlLink dissent  was  urlLink alive  and  urlLink well . That it was  urlLink wrong  and  urlLink fairly moronic  in its varying forms is another matter.    I can certainly recall friends, colleagues, and confidantes of mine that kept a low profile with their declination toward a pro-war stance, commonplace from sea to shining sea, little over a year ago. They feared ridicule. They fear for their jobs and their livelihood. They feared rejection from their peers.  Ok, so because people with unpopular views risked actually being TOLD their views were unpopular, this is somehow "unconscionable"?  And at last check, freedom from ridicule or rejection by one's peers were not what  urlLink FDR had in mind .  Those that advocated for peace were ridiculed with such inane, juvenile terms as “moonbats.”   Almost as juvenile and inane as suggesting that the U.S. is not a free nation, I suppose. And what does it mean to "advocate peace"?  EVERYONE advocates peace.  What matters is what form that peace will take.  To say you are an "advocate of peace" means nothing--its uninformative and conveys nothing.  Hitler "advocated peace"--and there would have been peace had the Allies not decided to be all uppity and keep fighting.   France – the first ally of the United States mind you – was denounced in the hallowed halls of the Congress of the United States in the most unfledged manner.  Of what possible relevance is it that France was an early ally of the U.S.?  Nevermind they allied with us because it helped weaken the British (rather than a great love for our grand experiment--which the French then screwed up rather well), but when France's chief  urlLink foreign policy stance  is to be  urlLink be a check to American power --that's no longer an ally, that's an adversary.  Not an enemy mind you, we're not killing each other, but France cannot, by ANY rational calculation, be considered an ally today.  And it's downright ig'nant to suggest as much.  It was a time at which I began to gravely fear for the sanctity and preservation for our American way of life.  Yes, "Freedom Fries" and "moonbats" are far more dangerous than murderous Islamists hurtling thousands of pounds of metal and jet fuel into civilians.  The tides have changed some; an election year may have a role to play in just that.   Pulled back from the brink! Praise *insert non-offensive non-judgmental deity-type figure here*!  From an administration that was chomping at the bit to invade and occupy, they have now turned a blushed shade of embarrassment looking for the nearest exit.  Thanks in part to the steely resolve and determination of thoughtful dissenters like our intrepid writer here...  From the CBS Documentary on the Abu Ghraib prison scandal to the endless rows of crosses – representing American troops killed in conflict – that lined Santa Monica Beach,   They are not endless. There have been 825 deaths of American servicemen in Iraq. It cheapens their sacrifice and memory immensely and betrays an astounding ignorance of both the nature of warfare and the relative bloodlessness of this war to call a combat death rate of 0.6% "endless."  I believe that Americans are once again ready, willing and unafraid to stand up and say ‘no’ to the prevailing throes of authoritarianism and fear.   So long as those throes aren't coming from elsewhere in the world--we CAN'T combat them--that would be well...not advocating peace.   Even if the rogue regime that must be confronted comes from Washington, DC.  "Even if"?  Try "only if we can be too-clever-by-half and convince ourselves that WE are the ones living in the police state."  The American people, for their part, are now more disappointed than ever with the turn of events in the Middle East, and I feel that a return to a true, and more importantly unhindered, freedom to disagree may be inevitable.  I was unaware the First Amendment had been altered.  Did I miss a memo?  Our intrepid author's freedom to utter nonsensical drivel is as protected, and subject to denouncement/refutation/ridicule/fisking/whatever as it was on Sept 10, 2001.  I’m not about to make a partisan argument  Too late.  but I feel it significantly important that we the people always be able to have a representative democracy, for, of, and by the people.  That our author invokes Lincoln to argue AGAINST the liberation of 50 million is ironic to say the least.  When the opinions of even the smallest minority are overlooked, or worse dismissed forthright, democracy fails,   Nothing about democracy requires unpopular or otherwise rejected ideologies/idea/positions/opinions be given credence.  So long as people have the freedom to express their opinions without being jailed or beat up (and they do)--then democracy is working juuuuuust fine.  Further, what kind of stunted mental process works off the assumption that these opinions are "overlooked"--isn't is just as likely--and indeed, FAR more plausible that they've been looked at, recognized as being tripe, and summarily rejected?  And isn't THAT supremely democratic?  and what is left is something that vaguely resembles a dangerous cross between fascism and national socialism, painted over in red, white and blue.   urlLink Godwin's Law  makes an appearance.   If we are to be the beacon of freedom to the world, then freedom must start here and freedom must persevere here. This nation must continue to be a forum of ideas; a canvas, if you will, with strikingly different and contrasting colours.  Wouldn't this be a call to ALLOW a more prevalent voice for those advocating national socialism? But of course the author doesn't mean that...since that would be consistent.     A plutocratic oligarchy was never meant to rear its ugly head underneath the Stars and Stripes.  There's actually a fair argument to be made that the Founding Fathers DID intend something of an oligarchy--just one whose members would vary every two/four/six years.    This country was founded on dissent, and on dissent it shall endure. Power to the people, both now and forever.  No, this country was founded on  urlLink consensus -- urlLink after   urlLink all -- urlLink more   urlLink than   urlLink a   urlLink couple   urlLink states   urlLink had   urlLink to   urlLink ratify   urlLink this    urlLink here   urlLink pesky   urlLink document .

      Kevin at Wizbang wonders why nobody in Hollywood will be making a movie about Lt. John McLoughlin,  urlLink the last man rescued from the WTC  by Marine Dave Kearnes, who, upon learning of the attacks, dropped everything and drove from Connecticut to NYC to help in the rescue efforts.  Why indeed?  Regrettably, movies about such men no longer get made.  What are the chances of an  urlLink Audie Murphy  existing in today's Hollywood? Zip.  Why? Because movies need villans...and Nazis or terrorists aren't enough for the pampered elites.  In Hollywood, a world ruled by backbiting and infighting, the notion that the bad guys might actually be OUTSIDE one's sphere of colleagues/co-workers is nearly unthinkable.  There must always be some sniveling bureaucrat or figure of authority (cop, boss, supervisor, politician, etc) that always keeps the protagonist from doing his job.  So the idea that a movie about either Dave Kearnes or John McLoughlin is, unfortunately, nothing more than an idea.

      NYT has a hilarious story on some of the  urlLink goofballs that will be protesting the GOP convention  this summer.   First there's the "Bellman":  Mr. Herold has ordered hundreds of one-inch, gold-plated bells - the kind that could easily adorn a Christmas tree - that he plans to distribute to any takers. He will call participants in his Ring Out project to surround ground zero - as close as they can - and raise a cacophony to "ring out the Republicans" shortly before the convention opens on Aug. 30.  "The bell stands for different emotions - anger, alarm - and it's emblematic of the Liberty Bell," Mr. Herold, 47, said the other night as he and three companions readied dozens of bells to show at a meeting of protest groups.   There's Luke, an aspiring Sauron:  Luke Kuhn, 38, a self-described radical who lives near Washington, has sent out e-mail pleas seeking a suitable kiln to melt a brass ring, about the size of a large wedding band, inscribed with Bush Über Alles, at the start of the convention.   And the Thong-Squad:  Axis of Eve, a protest group formed in January to focus on women's rights, is selling underwear adorned with anti-Bush slogans and is organizing 100 women to flash them during the convention (The underwear will be worn over body suits or leotards to keep it legal.)  Zoe, who's something of a low budget  urlLink Christo :   Zoe Strauss, a Philadelphia photographer, is urging people to wear red bandannas en masse as a symbol of protest and plans to bring 10,000 to the convention to hand out.   Then there's the puker:  Wendy Tremayne, a performance artist, is recruiting volunteers for a Vomitorium, a re-enactment of a Roman orgy that she plans to stage as a protest against imperialism, consumerism and gluttony.  And lest we think this is a high-tech affair--let's revisit Luke, our unemployed bike messenger kiln seeker:   Inspired by the "Lord of the Rings," the ring "makes a point that Bush is a dark lord," Mr. Kuhn said. Therefore, it must be destroyed, as in the book and movies, but Mr. Kuhn is not sure how to do it: maybe using a barbecue grill with coals fanned by a hair dryer.  "I can make a bellows, if nobody has a hair dryer, from salvaged wood that day, if necessary," he wrote on an electronic bulletin board. "I can easily rig the grill to be an improvised 'forge,' as a blacksmith would know it, and that will easily handle the destruction.''   I kinda do hope the networks cover the protests now--this sounds awesome.

      My mom and her husband are currently on a  urlLink cruise to Florence, Italy with both Victor Davis Hanson and David Horowitz  (I got a couple books signed).  So here's  urlLink VDH on the notion that the strategy of preemption is somehow a new and wholly Bushian strategy :   Rubbish. Preemption is a concept as old as the Greeks. It perhaps was first articulated in the fourth book of Thucydides’s history, in which the veteran Theban general Pagondas explained why his Boeotians should hit the Athenians at the border near Delium, even though they were already retreating and posed no immediate threat. The Boeotians did and won—and were never attacked by the Athenians again. On a more immediate level, preemption was how many of us stayed alive in a rather tough grade school. Confront the bully first, openly, and in daylight—our Texan principal warned us—before he could jump you as planned in the dark on the way home. I don’t think imperial Germany was a direct threat to the United States when we sent troops to Europe in 1917; rather we preempted at least in part in fear that the defeat of France and Great Britain would inevitably imperil our own security in the future both on the seas and in Europe. *** Nor has the United States established “a dangerous precedent” in hitting Saddam Hussein before he could add any more corpses to his three-decade-long record of carnage. Turkey did not jump back into Cyprus. We did not move on to hit Havana. Pakistan and India are now talking and playing cricket—not in smoke amid cinders. Neither was emboldened by the three-week war—as shrill critics in the United States promised—to strike the other first. No frontline Arab state saw the March 2003 attacks as an invitation to bomb Israel, now convinced that the United States has sanctified first-strike strategy.  On multilateralism:   Perhaps the greatest example of “multilateral” military action was the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. Think of the vast multilateral coalition! Germans, Austrians, Romanians, Czechs, Finns, Spaniards, Bulgarians, and Italians all united together to attack Communist Russia, which in turn had no other combatants on its front but unilaterally minded Russians.   In 1939 Great Britain was a unilateral power, threatened by a broad multilateral axis and without any real ally. The 1956 Suez Crisis was a multilateral enterprise—an undertaking by France, Great Britain, and Israel. It was stopped unilaterally by the Eisenhower administration. Israel in 1973 reacted unilaterally to a preemptive strike from a multilateral coalition involving Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq. The only real constant was not preemption/multilateralism/unilateralism but simply that a democratic state was fighting many others who were not.  But ultimately, he hits it on the head with:   The Left’s problem is not our embrace of the concept of “unilateralism” per se—or it would have attacked Clinton’s U.N.-be-damned use of force in Iraq, Kosovo, and Haiti. No, the rub is something altogether different. A Christian, southern-accented, conservative Republican president, coming off a disputed election, has chosen to preempt. And when you hit first in a therapeutic America, you are at least supposed to bite your lip and squeeze Hillary’s hand on national television. You do not dare say, “Bring ’em on” and “Smoke ’em out”—much less fly a jet out to an aircraft carrier.

           Hush'd be the camps to-day;    And, soldiers, let us drape our war-worn weapons;    And each with musing soul retire, to celebrate,    Our dear commander’s death.        No more for him life’s stormy conflicts;            Nor victory, nor defeat—no more time’s dark events,    Charging like ceaseless clouds across the sky.        But sing, poet, in our name;    Sing of the love we bore him—because you, dweller in camps, know it truly.        As they invault the coffin there;     Sing—as they close the doors of earth upon him—one verse,    For the heavy hearts of soldiers.

      From Dmitri over at Civil War Bookshelf comes this excerpt from  urlLink "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" :    Coffin that passes through lanes and streets, Through day and night with the great cloud darkening the land,  With the pomp of the inloop'd flags, with the cities draped in black, With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the night,  With the countless torches lit, with the silent sea of faces and the unbared heads, With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces, With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong and solemn, With all the mournful voices of the dirges pour'd around the coffin, The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs - where amid these you journey, With the tolling bells' perpetual clang, Here, coffin that slowly passes,  I give you my sprig of lilac.

      Haven't gone back to this topic in a while but I figured I should lest I be accused of being lazy or incomplete.   urlLink Background :  The left generally argues that the War in Iraq is separate from the War on Terror and is somehow unjustified.  To counter charges they are merely reflexively anti-war and defeatist, they often allege that they were staunchly behind the war in Afghanistan. So what I'm doing is just going through the editorials of major US and world papers to show that the same sort of defeatism and cries of Vietnam/quagmire/unilateralism/etc were there for the War in Afghanistan.    urlLink Part 1 was the NYT  (methodology is found here)  urlLink Part 2 was the WaPo   urlLink Part 3 was Boston Globe   Now, I'm going to take a look at the  urlLink San Francisco Chronicle .   SEPTEMBER 14, 2001, FRIDAY--Building the alliance  (SFC suggests allying with 2/3 of the Axis of Evil)   The Bush administration should continue to push hard to expand the alliance to take on the perpetrators of Tuesday's ghastly assault on America. We were heartened by Powell's steel and wisdom yesterday as he talked about having a "responsible, sober discussion" with Pakistan about the need for its cooperation.  Even Libya, North Korea and Iran have condemned the attacks. The broader the alliance -- even if it means holding our noses in some cases -- the easier it will be to pursue and destroy the perpetrators' network wherever it hides.  Each additional ally we enlist will give us more land, water and air space to traverse freely in pursuit of our still-undetermined adversary.   SEPTEMBER 25, 2001, TUESDAY--Showing the proof  (SFC gets war mixed up with an episode of "Law and Order")   But as large-scale military attack on Afghanistan becomes more and more likely,  many Americans and foreign leaders are becoming apprehensive at the apparent lack of hard evidence implicating bin Laden .  *** Although it's true that the investigation must not be compromised by public release of evidence, the Bush administration should not get a blank check to attack any target it wants.  Should the Bush administration be the sole judge and jury?  There has been a streak of Wild West, get-out-of-my-way unilateralism in Bush's foreign policy.  Some Bush administration officials have said publicly that the United States should attack "terrorist" nations besides Afghanistan -- such as Iraq and Sudan -- even if those nations had no involvement in the Sept. 11 disaster.   OCTOBER 3, 2001, WEDNESDAY--Restraint as a weapon  (The vaunted and over-hyped fighting prowess of the Taliban emerges--contrasting this with the snide comments about the US helping to "create" the Taliban by not having enough of a presence in Afgh. is curious)    But many experts on Afghanistan say the Taliban are usually poor fighters who turn fierce only when confronted by a foreign invader such as the Soviets in the 1980s. Don't provoke this nationalist reaction by invading with large numbers of U.S. troops or bombing populated areas, the experts say . Just arm the Alliance and use plenty of grease -- diplomatic muscle, weapons and even money -- to coax other warlords, tribal leaders and even dissident Taliban commanders to join the anti-terrorist struggle.   OCTOBER 7, 2001, SUNDAY--Life in black and white by Stephanie Salter  (Moral equivalence by way of a crazy-ass extended "Casablanca" metaphor)    For once, I envy the people for whom there are no contradictions: There are bad guys and good guys. Period. Americans are always good guys because we live in the Best Place on Earth, which means that all other places and the people in them are inferior -- there's only one best -- but, hey, they shouldn't take it personally.   Yes, my kingdom and the tunnel of cognitive dissonance for a world of black-and-white. Preferably beautiful black-and-white like "Casablanca." Filmed in 1942, it is one of the escape passages I've ducked into since Sept. 11 for respite from all the bouncing.   OCTOBER 8, 2001, MONDAY--And so the war begins  (Attacking terrorists only leads to more violence...)   But yesterday's strikes had a far more ominous feel for Americans than the similar-appearing scenes from Kosovo, Sudan or Iraq.  The United States has no illusions that this mission can be accomplished with aerial bombs alone. And there was little question that these bombings would provoke a counterattack against civilians on U.S. soil .    OCTOBER 12, 2001, FRIDAY--A new international spirit; If the U.S. can cooperate to combat terrorism, it can cooperate to pursue justice by Diane Marie Amann  (Wars can't combat terrorism, but the Int'l Criminal Court can--and note the confidence that Americans won't be brought under the JDX of the ICC--it ain't for lack of trying, that's for sure)   The success so far of this joint endeavor compels a closer look at another opportunity for justice through cooperation, the proposed International Criminal Court.  Not long ago that suggestion would have drawn laughter.  Bush had swaggered onto the foreign-policy scene like a latter-day Matt Dillon aiming to shoot down the supposed menace of international entanglement. He pulled out of the Kyoto protocol, a pact to halt global warming. His national security adviser spoke of U.S. withdrawal from the Balkans. U.N. back dues remained unpaid, hostage to the unrestrained whims of Congress' most passionate isolationists. The Bush message was clear: The world's lone superpower preferred to go it alone.   *** The attacks of Sept. 11 changed everything.  In an instant we learned that, like it or not, superpower or no, we are part of the rest of the world. We learned that what we do, what we stand for, stirs emotions well beyond our borders. It even breeds murderous hatred among unknown and faraway people, whom we cannot fight, cannot even find, alone . And so the Bush administration did not strike out on its own. Instead, it sought help. Friends rallied quickly, offering condolences, pledging military support, and damming the flow of money to terrorists. Even countries not always friendly to the United States spoke out against the attacks. Some agreed to let our bombers fly over their territory. In these last weeks, therefore, we have learned that international cooperation can be a good thing.   OCTOBER 12, 2001, FRIDAY--Airwaves as a battlefield  (Bush and Bin Laden are equivalent in the propaganda war--and heaven forbid news organization be asked to NOT broadcast bin Laden's messages)    PROPAGANDA can be one of the most effective weapons of war. Osama bin Laden certainly knows it. So does President Bush.  ***  Still, there is something unsettling about having the White House try to guide what should be news executives' judgments .  Rice suggested, without offering any evidence, that bin Laden could be sending secret signals to terrorists on the video . She also argued, more persuasively, that bin Laden's tapes could unduly frighten Americans and whip up anti-U.S. sentiment overseas.  It must be noted that U.S. journalists historically have been quite deferential to government's concerns about the reporting of troop movements, planned attacks or anything else that could put lives or a mission in danger. Some 17 U.S. news organizations were aware of Sunday's bombings in Afghanistan in advance; none leaked a word.   The suppression of enemy propaganda is a more troubling request. One of the journalists' jobs in times of war is to cut through the propaganda from both sides . Americans would not want the media to obstruct U.S. military operations in any way, but they should expect journalists to provide a forthright and independent assessment of any official pronouncements -- including those from the Pentagon or the White House.   OCTOBER 16, 2001, TUESDAY--Why bombing and warnings are not working by Hasan Jafri & Lewis Dolinsky  (headline speaks for itself)   For all of Slobodan Milosevic's bluster and disdain for America during the Kosovo war, the Yugoslav leader caved in because he got the message. The Taliban don't. And President Bush's ultimatums inflame Afghan passions against the United States. Even worse, they help Osama bin Laden.  *** In the meantime, Washington cannot engage the Afghans in any meaningful dialogue by serving ultimatums and dropping bombs.   OCTOBER 16, 2001, TUESDAY--New respect for the U.N  (U.S. action must seek UN permission)   But last week, a few days before the Nobel decision, the administration muddied the waters by informing the U.N. Security Council that the United States "may find that our self-defense requires further actions with respect to other organizations and other states." This was a vague reference to Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Iran and Sudan, to name a few nations that administration hard-liners have reportedly advocated attacking.   What are the limits of self-defense? Who decides, and when? The U.N. Charter doesn't say. Many U.S. allies fear that overuse of the concept may allow Washington to declare open hunting season on any and all enemies.   Seeking to mollify its allies, the Bush administration hinted that the United Nations might be entrusted with governing Afghanistan after the war.   This is a laudable evolution in U.S. policy. Washington needs to continue looking toward the United Nations -- not merely as a cheering section for its military action, but as the central arbiter of international law.    OCTOBER 17, 2001, WEDNESDAY--Afghanistan: We didn't have to do this by Stephanie Salter  (ummm...yeah)    What we are doing in, above, and to Afghanistan is short-sighted, counterproductive and immoral.  That I am among a mere 6 or 10 percent of Americans (depending on the poll) who feel this way hurts my heart.   The amount of nonthink, or flat-out denial, that is required to support Operation Enduring Freedom is painful to contemplate. Sending thousands of kids -- "our brave men and women in uniform" -- to risk their lives for it is unbearable.     We Americans have never been known for critical thought and analysis.  Context and historical perspective rank low on our national priorities list, somewhere below foreign language skills but above gas conservation. Add to that our deliberate myopia and chronic impatience, and you have the U.S. military trashing big chunks of Kabul, Kandahar and Mazar-I-Sharif in pursuit of a cave-dwelling, mass murderer and his worldwide band of suicidal disciples.   OCTOBER 24, 2001, WEDNESDAY--Good news -- many deplore bombing Afghanistan by Stephanie Salter  (I like this lady, she's like a budget version of Maureen Dowd)   Given that every major poll says Americans back this military strategy to the tune of 90 to 94 percent, I hunkered down for what I was sure would be a tsunami of you-traitor, love-it-or-leave-it response.   I'm elated to report I was wrong. While the missives still roll in (more than 1,500 e-mails alone), they are running about 6 to 1 in support .   NOVEMBER 11, 2001, SUNDAY--The sacrifices we must make BY Stephanie Salter  (U.S. trained bin Laden and we like killing babies...or something)   To the people of Afghanistan: ***  In a nutshell, we are worth more than you.   Please, don't take this personally. (Remember, we are your friends.) It's just the way it is, no matter who's president or which party controls Congress. *** What I'm trying to say is, you people are more accustomed to dying, early and in large numbers, than we are.  For you to lose 5,000 people in one day is normal. For us, it's beyond horrible.  If 5 million or 6 million of you have to starve so we can avenge our dead, so we can -- keep your fingers crossed -- get bin Laden and keep him from ever doing this to us again, it's a price we're willing to pay.   I promise you, most of us will feel bad for you.  And, when it's all over, those of you who survive will be in for good times like you've never had. We might even come in with some kind of mini-Marshall Plan that will help you set up a real democracy, just like ours. Imagine, living in a society where individuals matter and every life is precious.   NOVEMBER 14, 2001, WEDNESDAY--To tame war's tempo  (We won the war TOO quickly)   IS THERE such a thing as too much success?  Suddenly, chaotically, the Bush administration's war campaign is turning into a victorious race across Afghanistan.   Being left in the dust is the State Department's campaign to create a broad-based government and a United Nations-sponsored peacekeeping team.   SUMMARY :  Chronicle wasn't too bad (again, everything kind of pales in comparison to the NYT)--though Stephanie Satler came across as I said, a low-budget Maureen Dowd--but all in all--I think the paper get about a C+ (if a letter grade be appropriate). But I think the paper shared much of elite media's fixation on turning everything over the the UN or some other ineffectual body or that somehow KILLING terrorists somehow works to their advantage--I still haven't worked my head around that one yet.  Hence the C+.

      Here's an  urlLink interview with USA PATRIOT Act author Viet Dinh  where he defends the act from some of the goofier charges raised against the act.   WN: In his recent State of the Union address President Bush pushed to have parts of the Patriot Act, such as section 215, renewed when their sunset clause kicks in next year. Did you intend for these sweeping laws and other powers granted in the Patriot Act to be remedial measures or long-standing legislation?   Dinh: I did not intend any of these provisions, nor did Congress intend the provisions, to be having such wide-sweeping effect that your characterization would make it out to be. I think that is a fundamental mischaracterization of both the meaning, the effect and the operation of the law and the interpretation of the law.   Section 215 only follows the long-standing practice of (allowing) criminal investigators to be able to seek business records that are relevant to criminal investigations. Section 215 gives the same power to national security investigators in order to seek the same records with very important safeguards. First, a judge has to approve such orders, not simply a clerk of the court, as in ordinary criminal investigations. Second, the Department of Justice is under a statutory obligation in section 215 to report to Congress once every six months on the manner and the number of times it has used that section. And third, it calls for special protection by requiring that the FBI not target an investigation based solely on First Amendment activities.   There has been a lot of hue and cry regarding specific provisions with USA Patriot Act that is predicated upon a misunderstanding. Once we engage in this national conversation that the president has called for, all the facts will come out, and we will see that the fears are unfounded.   WN: Hasn't a national conversation been lacking until now? The act was passed very quickly. There hasn't really been any national debate or any willingness by the government to debate this issue.   Dinh: The USA Patriot Act was passed after six weeks of deliberation by Congress. That is a very quick process in the normal legislative agenda, but then again the six weeks following Sept. 11 was a very unique time in our national history and also in the legislative process. For those six weeks, key members of Congress, including the members of the Senate and House judiciary committees, sat down and rolled up their sleeves. And while the process was very quick, it was also the most deliberate process that I have seen in Washington, D.C.   With respect to the ongoing national conversation, I think it should be noted that the administration and the Department of Justice has, within the last six months to a year, given incredible amounts of information to Congress regarding how the USA Patriot Act has been implemented, to provide to Congress the information that Congress needs in order to do the proper oversight and debate for the next level -- that is, the reauthorization debate in 2005.    Now, I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Dinh last summer in DC on a  urlLink Federalist Society   Student Leadership Conference (we got to have dinner at Solicitor General Ted Olson's house--how cool is that?).  Mr. Dinh was an energetic, passionate, and scary smart kind of guy. Here's a picture, I'm the tall one:   urlLink      &nbsp; urlLink

      AP reports that the State Dept warned the Administration  urlLink that rejecting international standards against torture could put US forces at risk.    The memo followed recommendations from the Justice Department advising the president he could suspend international treaties prohibiting torture. It warned that failing to apply the Geneva Conventions to detainees from the war in Afghanistan - whether al-Qaida or Taliban - would put U.S. troops at risk.  "A decision that the conventions do not apply to the conflict in Afghanistan in which our armed forces are engaged deprives our troops there of any claim to the protection of the convention in the event they are captured," State Department legal adviser William H. Taft IV wrote in the 2002 memo to presidential counsel.   Is there ANY evidence that Al Qaeda or the Taliban would give two shytes about abiding by the Geneva conventions or any other prohibitions on torture?  The argument that groups that are so willing to indiscriminately murder innocents will somehow now "find religion" (pun intended) and abide by international agreements that they are not signatories to is simply daffy.

      This story is a couple days old, but SCOTUS has held in   urlLink Austria v. Altmann, 03-13   (link to the PDF Slip Opinion) that  urlLink Austria can be sued for stolen property/looted paintings/war crimes . Excerpt:   The 6-3 ruling allows 88-year-old Maria V. Altmann of Los Angeles to pursue her claim over six paintings by Gustav Klimt that were stolen from her uncle in Vienna by the Nazis. The paintings are held by the Austrian Gallery in Vienna.   Before 1952 the U.S. gave foreign nations full immunity from lawsuits in U.S. courts. A 1952 State Department policy began allowing suits against foreign nations over their commercial acts. In 1976 Congress enacted the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which spelled out the 1952 policy and allowed suits over property taken in violation of international law.    This raises the question--would Iraqi-American citizens who fled Saddam's Iraq be entitled to recover from the new Iraqi gov't for actions done by Saddam?  This opinion itself doesn't really shed much light on the question since the conduct in question occurred BEFORE the passage of the FSIA and the Court says its opinion is "extremely narrow"  Nevertheless, I shall soldier on. This  urlLink article provides a good overview of the FSIA .  Basically, FSIA presumes that foreign states are immune unless the plaintiff can point to a specific exception which would override that immunity.  The foreign state could waive immunity, or it could be involved in commercial activity rendering it outside the FSIA's grant of immunity:   Under the commercial activity exception, a foreign state is not immune if the plaintiff''s action is "based upon" 1) a commercial activity carried on in the U.S. by the foreign state; 2) an act performed in the U.S. in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state outside the U.S.; or 3) an act outside the U.S. that was taken in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state outside of the U.S. and that caused a direct effect in the U.S.47 Thus, the exception actually comprises three distinct clauses that provide independent grounds for exercising jurisdiction over the foreign state.   The threshold question when analyzing the commercial activity exception is whether the activity of foreign state was commercial rather than public. The act''s definition of commercial activity reveals little about on the meaning of the phrase.48 However, it does dictate that it is the nature of an activity that determines its commercial character, not the purpose underlying it. Thus, the fact that the foreign state engaged in an act for a public purpose does not render the act public. The proper focus is whether the particular actions that the foreign state performs, whatever the motive behind them, are the type of action by which a private party engages in trade or commerce.49 According to the U.S. Supreme Court, whenever "a foreign government acts, not as a regulator of a market, but in the manner of a private player within it, the foreign sovereign''s actions" qualify as commercial under the FSIA.50   If the activity is found to be commercial, the next question becomes whether the act fits within one of the three clauses set forth above. The focus of all three of these clauses is the nexus between the foreign state''s commercial activity and the U.S. The case law interpreting and applying these clauses is extensive, with the courts routinely engaging in fact intensive analyses of whether the foreign state''s commercial conduct had a sufficient nexus with the U.S. to fall within the exception. A recurring theme in these analyses is the requirement that plaintiff''s cause of action arise directly from the foreign state''s commercial activity in the U.S. or the act outside of the U.S. that causes a direct effect in the U.S.51    So would Saddam's taking of property constitute commercial activity? I wouldn't think so--that strikes me more, given his position as the dictator, as the actions of a gov't, rather than of those of a private party engaged in commerce.  Granted, it's not a very NICE gov't--but it's still ultimately a gov't action rather than a commercial one.   But what about Saddam's conduct vis a vis the Oil for Food program? That could (it's a stretch) be said to be a form of breach of contract insofar as Saddam never held up his end of the bargain to, y'know, FEED his people.  But that effect isn't likely to be felt by any US citizens--and hence you'd have the jurisdictional issue to worry about.  So ok, if you can't sue when Saddam takes your house--could you sue when he kills your family? Excerpt:   ...a foreign state is not immune for acts, not otherwise encompassed in the commercial activities exception above, in which money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or death or damage to property, occurring in the U.S. and caused by the tortious act or omission of that foreign state or of any official or employee of that foreign state while acting within the scope of his or her office or employment.57 However, the exception does not apply to 1) any claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function regardless of whether the discretion be abused, or 2) any claim arising out of malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights.58  *** The exception applies only when the tortious acts or omissions of a foreign state occur in the U.S. In fact, it has been held that the exception applies only when the entire tort takes place in the U.S.61 It is clear that the mere fact that the plaintiff suffered injury in the U.S. as a result of tortious acts occurring abroad is not sufficient to bring the action within the exception.62    So it would seem that even here, since the hypothetical torts didn't occur in the US--that the plaintiffs would be unable to sue in a US court.  This might all be moot of course if the court applied the  Act of State Doctrine --which the Court in the Austria case did not rule on--basically that doctrine (stealing from my Conflicts outline) holds that US Courts will not sit in judgment on acts of gov’t of another done within its (2nd’s) own territory.  A court will not sit in judgment of a foreign state after applying this three factor test (taken from   urlLink BANCO NACIONAL DE CUBA v. SABBATINO, 376 U.S. 398 (1964)  ) and my Conflicts outline:   a.	Degree of codification/consensus concerning particular area of int’l law b.	Implications of issue re: US foreign relations c.	Balance of relevant considerations may be shifted if gov’t which did the challenged act is no longer in existence  One can easily see the implications to US foreign relations if a wacky court decided to let Iraqi-citizens sue the new Iraqi gov't for the actions of the old (no longer existing) regime.  Indeed, you'd have briefs galore filed by the gov't and State Department practically begging the court to not allow such a suit to proceed.  And what a headline THAT would make:  "U.S. Seeks to Block Victims of War Crimes from Recovery"--ok, I'm depressed now. And my head hurts.

      BFT has an  urlLink open letter to the L.A. Times  objecting to their broad-brush characterization that gays "remember Reagan with bitterness", he makes the important point:   Let't get the record straight: partisan Democrats remember Reagan with bitterness. While it is true that a preponderance of the gay political class are partisan Democrats, your paper's broad generalizations cast a stereotype on our community.    He is right to note that "Gay is not a political philosophy" any more than being black or white or short or tall is.  But keeping with the gay theme yet on a wholly unrelated note, watching  urlLink Last Comic Standing  last night, the gay guy (named Ant I think) made it to the semifinals again.  He made it that far last year too.   But as gay is neither a political philosophy, it is also not a real solid basis for a stand-up routine.  The man's entire schtick was "How gay am I? How gay do you think I am? How gay are my friends? How gay do you gay the gay?"  I never much liked comics that talk about themselves to THAT extent.  It's reptitive, fairly unoriginal (after all, how gay can you REALLY be?) and it makes the offending comic look all the more insulated in their experiences.  This is reason I never liked comics with the "white people type like this (dorky)/black people type like this (crazy)" routine.  Never liked the comics that tell me just HOW [insert ethnic group] their family is.  Now, however, I WAS glad that  urlLink Dat Phan  won last year's Last Comic Standing--but that was primarily because everyone treated him like crap--but his routine is precisely the sort of "How Vietnamese is my mom?" routine that I dislike.    urlLink Margaret Cho  does the same kind of routine, but with a twist--"How Korean is my mom? How gay are my friends? And what wacky hijinks ensue when the two clash?!"  Now how was THAT for a wholly worthless post? Eh?

      Ok, so we've got a new  urlLink L.A. Times Poll  that shows Kerry with a 51-44 lead in a head to head and a 48-42 with Nader in the race.  Neverminding the fact that the poll is only of registered voters (rather than the more reliable likely voters)--hell, I think my neighbor's dog is registered to vote.  Though I don't think he'll vote, he's more into local elections.    Ok, so there's that--but Andrew Sullivan does a little bit of projection when he writes on his site:   KERRY'S LEAD WIDENS: I don't think this has anything to do with Kerry. It has to do with a collapse of confidence in the president's competence. I'm unsurprised.    There's no analysis, no even moderate skepticism, nothing to suggest that since  urlLink this poll is so out balls-out-inconsistent with other polls currently out there  that it might not be the best thing to hang one's hat one. Case is point:   Bush with an eleven point lead in Missouri? Not a chance. Even the biggest Bush booster in the country wouldn't claim that the President would win the Show-Me State by double digits as things stand right now. The latest polls show Bush has, at best, a tiny lead over Kerry.  In Ohio, three consecutive polls conducted during the last three weeks - including a Mason-Dixon one with a pretty big sample - show Bush with a small lead, but the LA Times has Kerry up by three.   Likewise, the last three polls in Wisconsin - albeit two from Zogby's online operation and one by a Dem firm - have Kerry ahead by sizeable margins. The LA Times has Bush up two. I suppose it's possible Bush has a small lead in Wisconsin, but not likely. With only two exceptions over the past three months (both Badger polls which I've been told over samples Republicans, by the way) the state has been leaning toward Kerry.    Nope we get none of that--we get "I'm unsurprised." In short, Sullivan is reading into this poll his own schizophrenic and ultimately unreliable political biases into the poll.  Blahhh....

      How's this for a creepy headline?  urlLink Committee concludes seven Dems were disloyal  .  Granted, the story isn't all that objectionable since it's just a party policing itself, excerpt:   KINGSTON - A five-member panel of Democrats ruled on Tuesday that seven members of the Saugerties Democratic Committee were disloyal when they campaigned last fall on behalf of candidates running against Democrats.  But the panel, which announced its decision after deliberating for half an hour, stopped short of recommending the removal to the so-called Saugerties Seven from the Ulster County Democratic Committee. Instead, they suggested the county committee delay making a decision until mid-July, when designating petitions for county committee seats are due.   But the headline sure sounds ominous.

      From  urlLink this piece in the LAT  on the extended hours for viewing President Reagan I found this quote:   Deborah Smith of West Los Angeles said "pure curiosity" prompted her to show up with her teenage son, Ryan. "I am not a fan at all," she said. "The word 'civil rights' never came out of his mouth."   Quick search of his  urlLink Public Papers  turns up 1,896 separate documents containing "civil rights."  I could excerpt lots of them--but I think this  urlLink one kinda does the job effectively enough :   Radio Address to the Nation on Civil Rights June 15, 1985  I guess if your definition of "civil rights" is limited to "what I agree with"--then yeah, you may find Reagan wanting--but then again, you likely should learn to chew with your mouth closed as well...after all, isn't "civil rights" two words?  NOTE: The article itself is a positive account of the proceedings--so don't take my title to impugn the LAT...at least not for this story...

      OTB notes a proposal being floated for  urlLink putting Reagan on the $10 bill  in place of Alexander Hamilton.  James writes:    It seems to me that it would make more sense to take Grant off the $50 or to relegate Washington and Lincoln to one currency apiece than to take Hamilton off the $10 bill.   I'd have to rather strongly disagree with taking Grant off the $50.  While Grant's presidency left much to be desired, his nearly Herculean efforts in leading the Army of the Potomac to victory cannot be understated.  If the standard is only what the men did AS PRESIDENTS, then there's no reason why Reagan shouldn't bump Hamilton or even Franklin--since neither have a Presidential record to speak of.  Of course, not all our bills are adorned with presidents--of those still in circulation,  urlLink only the $10 and $100 are adorned with non-POTUS'  (Hamilton and Franklin, respectively).  So given that, why should Grant get bumped but Franklin stay?  I say we bring back the $500 and bump McKinley. Heh.

       urlLink 'Bush should have died, not Reagan': Morrissey .  Well, Morrissey's got the moody, 35-going-on-bad-college-age-poet vote sewed up.    Thousands of fans at Dublin Castle, in Ireland, cheered when the ex-Smiths frontman made the announcement that the former American president, who had battled with Alzheimer's Disease, had passed away.  And an even bigger cheer followed when Morrissey - who is no stranger to controversy - then said he wished it had been the current President, George W Bush, who had died.   Not sure which is worse. That they cheered at the news of Reagan's death, or at the call that it should have been Bush.  As a factual matter though, I must take issue with the article's first line:   MANCHESTER  music legend  Morrissey sparked controversy...  Are things so dreary in Manchester that Morrissey is their resident legend?

      Two interesting pieces on the topic--the first from today's NYT on  urlLink France's "love" for the US but hatred of Bush :   Politicians speak of saying yes to America but no to Mr. Bush. The newspaper Libération warns Mr. Bush that he should not take President Jacques Chirac's expected expressions of gratitude as directed at him, but rather at America. Laurent Fabius, a former prime minister, says Mr. Bush is viewed "as the exact opposite of the values that make us love America."    The idea is very French. It is conceptual. It is subtle. It is intellectually pleasing. It projects the notion that France knows better than America what America really is or really should be. It harks back to the idea France shares with America: that the countries embody some eternal values and have a mission to export them to all mankind.   The view of America as separate from its leader also has a familiar ring. For decades after World War II, the argument that "La France" was distinct from its quisling, Jew-deporting Vichy government was a familiar one. In this view, Marshal Henri Philippe Pétain, the leader of the Vichy government, was not France, certainly not the eternal France of the Revolution, incarnated in the resistance leader Jean Moulin or in Charles de Gaulle himself.     I suppose it is fairly easy in a country with a history of dictatorial regimes and monarchs to separate the people from the President/King/ l'Empereur! .  It's a shade harder to do here in the U.S. since well, our leaders do tend to be a reflection of our collective values (or at least of the majority's).  Saying "I like what America stands for" or "I like the IDEALS of America" is like saying that you like the IDEA of your wife, but don't actually like the actual person. It doesn't fly.  The second piece is a  urlLink REALLY long one from the Hudson Review  that is far too long to summarize but very interesting and outlines that so much of European opinion about the US is based on just the sort of boorish behavior and ignorance that they routinely accuse us of being guilty of.  After all, when so much of Europe's opinion of America comes from  Baywatch  and  Sopranos  episodes, with a healthy dose of state run media--yeah, you're gonna get some fairly ignorant views of America.  On THAT note, I'm reminded of an  urlLink IM conversation I had with a French person  a short while ago that kind of personified this disconnect with the notion that us wild crazy gun toting Americans might actually have some intellectually defensible positions:    Cycy1384: dont u think american law is scaring?  CXCross : Scary? Not at all  CXCross : I happen to like it Cycy1384: u know we were shocked by monica lewinsky story   CXCross : I don't doubt it. But I do doubt that you heard the full story Cycy1384: well one of my friend told me , people were not well with the president only cause he lied   CXCross : The issue regarding Clinton's impeachment was not that he had sex...but rather that he lied about it UNDER OATH.  CXCross : In a judicial proceeding Cycy1384: but at the begining its is private life nah?  CXCross : It was his private life--but it was also the subject of an authorized investigation arising out of a civil suit for sexual harassment Cycy1384: i still think it s scarying yet lol   CXCross : Just because it's your private life doesn't mean you can be compelled to testify about it  CXCross : "Where were you last night?" Cycy1384: well we never talk about our president over here *** Cycy1384: but clinton was good for the international scene Cycy1384: whereas bush wow   CXCross : Clinton did very little for int'l scene Cycy1384: HE DID well for isrealo palestinian conflit   CXCross : He went into Haiti, Kosovo, and bombed Iraq all without UN approval...  CXCross : No, he brokered a deal that Arafat rejected.  CXCross : He rejected Kyoto (as did our Senate, 99 to nothing) Cycy1384: kyoto is a wordl treaty  Cycy1384: we still are shocked by this rejection   CXCross : To which the US has not ratified Cycy1384: here we think the usa are collapsing slowly    I've had these conversations before--it's a strange phenomenon--in the same breath that they claim the US is filled with ignorant people, they display an ignorance of the US that can charitably be described as....curious.

      On CNN, Bill Schneider warned conservatives not to try to turn Reagan's death into a political event (a la Wellstone's memorial service).   urlLink NRO's Corner referenced the piece  and CNN doesn't have a transcript I could find yet.   Schneider however, made another point that NRO didn't mention which stuck in my head as odd--he said something to the effect of:   "Ronald Reagan's legacy belongs to all of us."  For a media that spent so long trying to minimize or wholly subvert the Reagan legacy to now claim some right to it is downright odd.

But I have to say, and this will make sense once you see the movie:  I hate hippies.  Again, it'll make sense once you see the film.

      Ok, first the Dodgers trade Paul Lo Duca, which was forgiveable only if they could get Charles Johnson from Colorado--but apparently Johnson has  urlLink nixed the deal  and so LA is left with Dave Ross and have acquired Brent Mayne and Steve Finley from AZ.  But here's what REALLY pisses me off---they  urlLink traded Dave Roberts  to the Red Sox for a minor leaguer.  So basically, two of my favorite Dodgers in terms of both energy and just joy for the game are gone. And I get a broke down Steve Finley. Woo.  Seriously, unless this pans out, I'm gonna be seriously pissed. And why couldn't they have dealt Shawn Green away? Eh?    UPDATE : Of course, I realize Dave Roberts wasn't producing all THAT well--but still, he was my wallpaper on my PC...

      The Dems are doing this weird two-step when it comes to military service and Vietnam. It seems to work like this:   (1) The Vietnam war was an immoral exercise of American force against the sympathetic North Vietnamese Communists.  (2) If you dodged the draft or were a conscientious objector to this immoral conflict, that is honorable and shows how much you really love this country (or what it could be)   (3) No serviceman can be proud of what he did in Vietnam because of the immorality of the conflict.  (4) But if you VOLUNTEERED for combat duty in order to go off and kill Charlie, well, that's even BETTER because that shows how much you really love this country* (*) Offer good only if you subsequently acknowledge that the war was an immoral one.  (5) Anybody who served in a non-combat role or was NOT stationed in Vietnam (like say, Korea) has no claim to any honor or consideration and it just a worthless piece of scumsucking shyte. Call it "The Vietnam Shuffle"

      From  urlLink ESPN.com  .    The Florida Marlins traded pitcher Brad Penny, Hee Seop Choi and highly regarded Double-A pitcher Bill Murphy to the Dodgers for relief pitcher Guillermo Mota, catcher Paul Lo Duca and outfielder Juan Encarnacion.  ***  ESPN's Jim Bowden reported Friday that the Dodgers acquired catcher Charles Johnson from the Rockies, filling the void left when Lo Duca was sent to Florida in the Penny Deal  What is it with the Dodgers trading really good catchers to the Marlins? Although I am a big fan of Charles Johnson, so that softens the blow a bit.

       urlLink Spoons  has an excellent post on how, given the Dems repeated calls for "energy independence" and independence from Mideast oil, that Bush can bring back ANWR as a winning issue. He writes:   I doubt many will agree with me, but I think ANWR, correctly presented, could be a winning issue for Bush. If he devoted a few minutes in his convention speech to energy independence, announced some new program to fund research into hybrids or fuel cells or somesuch, and made an unapologetic case for drilling in ANWR, I'm convinced he'd pick up more votes than he'd lose.  I'd have to agree--just as the Dems tried to co-opt the patriotism/defense issue from the Republicans, the GOP can try the same thing re: energy independence. As Spoons suggests, combined with a solid call for further funding for alt. fuels, a call for increasing our domestic supply COULD be a winner.    For all their calls for reducing our dependence on Saudi oil, the Dems didn't offer anything in the way of ACTUALLY reducing our dependence on it in the short-term.  Fine, we'll fund alt. fuels up the wazoo--but until those begin to pay dividends (which won't be for a while), we're still going to rely on Mideast oil--the Dems ignored this fact.  Bush can exploit it.  On top of exploiting Kerry's voting against ANWR drilling, there is room to maneuver here for the GOP.  Spoons also raised this interesting point:   Bush won't get a better chance than the convention. Unfortunately, he's not a gifted speaker.  He's also not a political risk-taker.  I doubt we'll hear about ANWR at the Republican convention.   Emphasis mine.  This has always struck me as one of the great contradictions about Bush--for one so willing to stake his entire political being on a venture as admittedly risky as democratizing the Islamists, that Bush has been generally rsk-averse when it comes to appropriating Democratic issues is curious.  Granted, Bush did do a lot of such appropriating early in his term with "compassionate conservatism" and his education, faith-based, and similar legislation.  But lately, he hasn't been as willing to do so--he did try a little bit with his talk at the Urban League where he tried to drive a wedge between black voters and black leadership--but for the most part, Bush hasn't been too willing to get down and dirty.  Of course, he DOES have a war to win, but he also has a campaign to win. It's a curious contradiction with Bush. Not quite sure why.

      From the  urlLink NYT :   Mr. Kerry said Thursday night that he would roll back the tax cuts Mr. Bush enacted, but only for those earning more than $200,000 a year   On top of this we heard LOTS of calls against the deficit and deficit spending (indeed, Kerry expressly went out of his way to decry fighting a war "on the cheap."  On top of this we get promises of a variety of domestic programs from everything from healthcare, RX drugs, clean fuel, etc etc.    Does Kerry honestly expect to be able to continue to pay for both our military commitments in Iraq/Afghanistan as well as these new programs with the only proposed increased revenue stream being raising taxes on small-business owners and others making over $200K (since there's a LOT of overlap between the two) without increasing the deficit?  I see three possible outcomes from this:   (1) Defunding Iraq/Afghanistan operations (unlikely) (2) Refusal to fund/pass new social programs (also unlikely) (3) Raising taxes on more than those making $200K (most plausible) Am I missing anything?

Oh, and notice how in rattling off great Democratic presidents that fought bad guys, Jimmy Carter was not mentioned?

Remember, this is the night most people are actually watching...   UPDATE 3 : Headline for tomorrow's story on the Kerry girls' speeches:   Kerry daughters confirm that father is, in fact, human.

      After watching John Edwards'  urlLink speech  last night, I have come to the conclusion that I have absolutely no incentive to finish law school.  None.  I have neither incentive nor desire to work hard, to make more money than we currently do, or to eventually move out of our apartment into a home.    I have no desire to do this because I fear that should I become moderately succesfful, I will be punished like a mofo for it.  I don't want to earn over $200K, because that would place me in that "other America" where all gains are clearly ill-gotten.   I don't want to be in that other America.    I want to find the dignity in working my ass off and being unable to save because I spend too much money on luxury items.  I want to place myself on a pedestal for running up thousands in credit card debt, not for essentials, but because I didn't think to save one stinking dime.  I want to approach each day with a stoicism that is exceeded only by my bitching about being unable to afford a 3rd TV for my poverty level home.   John edwards has given me hope.  Hope that if I work hard enough and keep my nose to the grindstone long enough, that his gov't will rape the holy hell out of my wallet.   Not in MY America, bucko.

      WaPo-  urlLink Nostalgia for the Consensus of the 1990s  You'd have to get to the very end of the article (literally) to find this gem:   Jonathan Winer, a longtime aide in Kerry's Senate office in the 1980s and 1990s, said the election presents a choice between "faith-based policymaking versus empirically based policymaking."   When Kerry is confronting a choice, he added, "it's a series of questions, questions, questions."   Rubin, who knows Kerry less intimately than Winer does, said he was struck by the same thing during an economic policy discussion in March. "He's pushing you to disagree," he recalled, and he kept pressing for more detail about risks and unintended consequences. " 'Yeah, but if we do that, what happens over here?' "   Rubin said it is a style of analysis that is "enormously reminiscent of what it was like to be with President Clinton."   So, too, is some of the criticism of Kerry. Critics have said Kerry's penchant for deliberation and nuance is less a sign of rigorous thinking than of equivocation and a desire to game out the political angles of any question.   Winer said this criticism is unfair. "He's cautious about making decisions and using power too quickly -- not about making decisions and using power," Winer said.   One measure of the Thursday speech, Kerry strategists acknowledge, is whether Kerry can make this distinction clear, and show that the principles of the past decade have relevance in the next one.   Hey, I'm in law school. I know the value of deliberative thinking in order to fully analyze the problem at hand and try to get the most points on the exam.  However, we sometimes have these exams called "racehorse" exams.  This is where the professor throws you a ton of issues and gives you an insanely short amount of time.  You simply don't have time to analyze deeply each and every issue--if you do, you fail.  Your job in a racehorse exam is to merely recognize as many issues as possible, and then pick the one or two that are MOST relevant try to do a little deeper analysis of them.  Will your analysis be exhaustive? No.  Nor will be if you had an extra two hours.  But that's the point--with a few exceptions, we study these issues for the purposes of reaching a DECISION.  The analysis is needed to justify the decision, but ultimately, if the decision is correct, then that's what matters.  Similarly, national security decisions are "horserace" exams more often than they are deliberative ones.  You often don't have time to analyze each and every potential outcome--you don't have time to gauge how interest group X will be affected if you take action against group Y.    I get the feeling that Kerry approaches decision-making with the idea that he has all the time in the world--and that the important thing is that you "show your work" in reaching that decision.    And while that may work for your Criminal Procedure exam, it won't exactly put the screws to Al Qaeda in time.   UPDATE : Submitted to the  urlLink Beltway Traffic Jam

During Thursday night's proceedings, Kerry is expected to appear on stage to embrace Max Cleland, the former senator from Georgia who lost two legs and an arm in Vietnam and who was ousted from his seat in the Senate after attacks ads questioned his patriotism.   So the ads had nothing to do with Cleland's voting record on anti-terror legislation--nope, they were CLEARLY attacks on his patriotism. I mean, it's obvious, isn't it?

"But he knows that the American League East won't be decided until September" after the Republican convention in New York.  I like that, it shows Bush as being fundamentally confident in his own skin and in his position at this point, despite all the free hype the Dems are getting right now.

      NYT--  urlLink Kerry's Must-Sell: Tough Foreign Policy Emphasizing Steadiness    At the same time, as a Massachusetts Democrat, he cannot afford to leave himself exposed to Republican charges of liberal wobbliness. Such accusations already abound,  fed by Mr. Kerry's evolving position on Iraq  since his vote in 2002 authorizing Mr. Bush to use force.  (emphasis added) As Kaus would say, it's not a bug, it's a feature!  Then there's this:   "The rest of the world will breathe a huge sigh of relief with a Kerry administration, one willing to listen rather than bully," said James P. Rubin, a State Department spokesman in the Clinton years and a Kerry adviser. "He will not agree with the Europeans on everything, but NATO would be a first rather than a last resort."  I can think of several states that will feel relieved.  Problem is, don't really WANT them to be feelin' easy.

      Via  urlLink Mark Kilmer  comes  urlLink this story  about Michael Moore getting huffy with CNN's Bill Hemmer. The exchange itself is unremarkable (except for the general weirdness of Moore) but what struck me was the excerpt from the interview that made Moore so mad:   HEMMER: The DNC did not invite you here, is that right?  MOORE: The Congressional Black Caucus invited me here, yes. Yes.  HEMMER: Enjoy your week.  MOORE:  Those black congressmen, you know .   (emphasis mine) There's some weird attempt at validation there by Moore.  Does he think Hemmer WOULDN'T know the CBC? So why say it?  Granted, Moore has a fairly well documented  urlLink urban phobia , but his attempt (he does it often) to show that he's really fascinated by black people is simply weird.  Consider the  urlLink following :   "The kind of people who fly in airplanes want someone else to clean up their mess; that's why they let hijackers take the plane," said [Moore] late last fall in a one-man show in London. "If the passengers had included black men, those killers, with their puny bodies and unimpressive small knives, would have been crushed by the dudes, who as we all know take no disrespect from anybody. . . . The passengers on the planes on September 11 were scaredy-cats, because they were mostly white."   Aside from being a wholly tasteless slander of the  urlLink bravery  of the passengers of Flight 93, Moore's attempts to ingratiate himself so heavily into the hard-left black community just smacks of  urlLink upper-crust liberal condecension .  You almost expect Moore to quote  urlLink Randolph Duke  and say that blacks "sure are a musical people."

      Via  urlLink Spoons  comes this story from the  urlLink Wash Times  noting some of the things that we know are true re: the  urlLink Syrian Band From Hell , an excerpt:     The article confirms that 13 of the 14 Syrians were traveling on expired visas.   No one noticed.   Immigration and Customs Enforcement was supposed to be consulted, but wasn't.   They came from a country known to support terrorism and no one noticed their visas had expired?" one pilot asked.    The ease with which so many dismissed the story boggles given the apparently clear problems still present.   UPDATE:  urlLink Wizbang  has more, including:   The liberals have put themselves into the odd political position that they have to deny the reality that terror exists. If someone points out a hole in security, rather than urge it be fixed, the liberals attack that person and claim there is no such thing as terrorism. Truly odd behavior when you are trying to win an election on national security.  It's a fine line the Dems are walking.  For they need to argue simultaneously that Bush hasn't done enough to combat terror and make us safe, yet also that the threat is over-hyped and that Bush is guilty of fear-mongering. A weird combo.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A mid-year White House report will tout fiscal progress with a projected U.S. budget deficit for this year of around $420 billion -- nearly $100 billion less than the forecast offered five months ago, congressional sources said on Tuesday. *** The budget projection will be part of a mid-session budget report that the White House will be putting out, possibly as early as this week. Originally due on July 15, the document was delayed after officials in the Office of Management and Budget sought extra time to update their figures in light of improving economic conditions that have fueled higher tax revenues.    Can, or even should the GOP try to score any political points from this?  After all, $100b IS a lot of change, but then again, so is $420b.

      Something that struck me watching the DNC today was the general reluctance in describing the attacks on 9/11 AS attacks.  Most notably, when Glenn Close and the 9/11 widow spoke--they almost went out of their way to avoid calling them attacks.  Hillary Clinton did refer to them twice as attacks--but quickly moved on to healthcare.  I think this nicely illustrates one of the fundamental differences between how the Democrats and Republicans view both 9/11 and how to deal with it.  For Democrats, 9/11 was not an attack brought about by the willful malevolence of deranged and evil individuals.  Rather, 9/11 was an "event", a "tragedy", something that simply "happened" rather than was done to us.  Dems view 9/11 in the same way people view a natural disaster, like an earthquake or hurricane--as something that can only be regretted rather than something that can be actively prevented.  There's an obvious problem with this thinking: It's utopian lunacy.  If you deny or refuse to recognize that it is INDIVIDUALS at the controls of those planes--then you will not be willing to kill/capture/detain such individuals in the future when given the chance.  After all, you don't arrest people after a flood or an earthquake.  By refusing to acknowledge that there are whole swaths of people out there whose sole motivation is to murder as many Americans as possible, you render yourself incapable of mounting an effective war against such people.  And that's ultimately the bottom line: This is a war, not merely a "tragedy."

      Via  urlLink Irish Lass  comes  urlLink this wonderful story  about Teresa Heinz Kerry telling a reporter to "Shove it" after being reminded of what she said in a speech not a few minutes prior.  "We need to turn back some of the creeping, un-Pennsylvanian and sometimes un-American traits that are coming into some of our politics," she told her fellow Pennsylvanians at a Sunday night reception at the Massachusetts Statehouse.  Minutes later, Colin McNickle, the editorial page editor of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, questioned her on exactly what she meant by the term "un-American," according to a tape of the encounter recorded by WTAE Channel 4 Action News.  Heinz Kerry said "I didn't say that" several times to McNickle. She then turned to confer with Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and others. When she faced McNickle again a short time later, he continued to question her, and she replied, "You said something I didn't say. Now shove it."  Make sure you click on the link--it's got the full video, both with her speech where she clearly DOES say "un-American" and her repeated denials.  But here's something else, it should be disturbingly clear that it isn't the right that challenges the patriotism of others, but rather the left.  But what's more disturbing is the cavalier attitutde which they levy the charge.  Apparently calling someone unAmerican is so much a part of her everyday speech that it doesn't stick in Teresa's mind that she utters it.  That's kinda creepy.

       urlLink Justene at Calblog  notes her family had relatives on both sides of the Civil War, she writes:   The Confederate general owned no slaves. He did not go to war to protect slavery. He went to protect the South from the North, which dominated it, in his view. He advocated quite strongly early in the war that the slaves be freed.  Imagine our history books if he had prevailed. A Civil War which no one could say was about slavery. A South that freed the slaves.  I think this is interesting, though exceedingly far fetched.  While there were many (I'll even say majority) of Confederate soldiers that were not fighting for slavery but for their perceived territorial integrity against an invading North, I don't think this would have extended to any sort of magnanimity towards the slaves.  Especially not such that they'd be given their freedom.  Yes, a handful of black slaves were mustered into regiments in exchange for their freedom towards the end of the war--but that was done reluctantly by the Confederate Congress and only because the Southern military situation was so precarious.   Also, it's not certain that the commanding general of the amry could have had that much input into the post-war political situtation re: slaves.  After all, assume the South was led to victory by this anti-slavery Southerner.  Jeff Davis would still be President, the staunch pro-slavery plantantion owners would still dominate the Southern political system and the poor whites that neither owned slaves nor really cared (though they were NOT about to accept racial equality of any sort) would still be essentially out of the political loop.  All of this points to a continuation of the slaveholding status quo in the south.   And of course, if there was no slavery, then the war wouldn't be fought over it, but then again, it's unlikely the South would have seceded absent the desire to preserve that "curious institution."  So while somewhat interesting, I do not think, in any alternative history, wholly separate slavery from the Civil War equation--regardless of the personal motivations of the generals on the field.

      XRLQ has a  urlLink response  to my post  urlLink here  on HR 3133 and my disagreement with his seeming certainty that DOMA would survive a constitutional challenge.  XRLQ argues that my reading of the Art IV Sec 1 is incorrect insofar as it doesn't take into full account the second clause entitling Congress to prescibe the manner in which FFC shall be proved.    While I fully acknowledge that Congress has the right to determine the scope to which laws shall be given full faith and credit, I think the problem here is in the wording of DOMA.  **NOTE** I'm not arguing that DOMA is unconstitutional--the best argument for that, such as it is, is under the 14th Amendment.  I am rather arguing that, at least in California, DOMA is not applicable.  It's a slightly different argument, but not too far afield.  Re: the applicability of DOMA, XRLQ writes:   ...Congress’s power to regulate the manner and effect of proof of public acts appears to be plenary. Thus, to the extent that Chris II’s argument concerning California public policy is sound, it proves only that California’s public policy against gay marriage was too weak to survive a full faith and credit challenge if DOMA had never been enacted. It says nothing about the constitutionality of DOMA itself, or of any state law passed under its authority  I'm not sure I see the distinction between the CA policy exception to gay marriage where DOMA has been enacted vs where it has not.  DOMA is nothing more than than the statutory version of the public policy exception to the Full Faith and Credit clause specifically drawn up for gay marriage.  So while DOMA may not REQUIRE a state to recognize an out of state same sex marriage--that does not mean a court could still not find that the state's own legislation (in this case, Cal Fam Code 297.5) authorizes such recogniztion.   I think the sticking point at least in my CA example is the presence of 297.5--without that statute essentially eviscerating the disctintion between same-sex marriage and hetero marriage, I have no objection to DOMA preventing same sex marriage from being imposed on a state.  But in this case, a court interpreting both 308.5 and 297.5 would, I think, come to the conclusion that it is not requiring CA to recognize same-sex unions.  Rather, the deciding court is rather telling California what its policy is towards same-sex marriage in light of the two statutes.  Mind you, I don't think a court SHOULD do this, but nor do I think that a court COULDN'T do it.  So while Congress' power to make exception may be plenary, that does not mean that every exercise of that power is as broad as possible.

      XRLQ has an  urlLink excellent post on HR 3133 , the Marriage Protection Act.  He argues that opponents of gay marriage should oppose the MPA because removing the federal courts from the equation would allow state courts to still impose gay marriage on their citizenry with no appeal.  I have to take issue with this statement though:   Suppose that 49 state courts agree with me on the constitutionality of DOMA, but one state court - say, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts - does not.  Right now, that ruling would be swatted down on appeal , but if the MPA, the Supreme Court won’t have jurisdiction to hear the case, and the ruling will stand. Since the SJC has ruled under the federal constitution, and not just a tortured reading of its own constitution, the ruling will apply not only to Massachusetts residents, but to everyone else who can find a way to get his case into Massachusetts court.  I don't have as much confidence that a federal court on appeal would be so quick to hold DOMA constitutional. While XRLQ thinks the current Supreme Court would reverse say, a 9th circuit ruling that struck down DOMA, I am not so sure.    XRLQ points to the Full Faith and Credit clause of Art. IV to support his argument. However, suppose the case is brought in California challenging the constitutionality of DOMA by a Mass. couple. The Mass. couple points to their legal Massachusetts wedding and seeks recognition of it in CA.  CA points its  urlLink Family Code Section 308.5  functions as its own mini-DOMA and reads:   Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.  And argues that their being required to recognize the legitimacy of the Massachusetts wedding is precluded by the presence of 308.5 as being against the strong public policy of the State. The Court, has recognized a limiting principle inherent in the Full Faith and Credit clause:   “The Full Faith and Credit Clause does not require a state to apply another state's law in violation of its own legitimate public policy.”   Nevada v. Hall , 440 U.S. at 421.  The problem here lies in whether 308.5 as representing the "public policy" of CA is superseded by  urlLink Cal. Family Code Section 297.5 .  This is CA's Domestic Partnership law and here's the rub:   (a)  Registered domestic partners shall have the same rights , protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law, whether they derive from statutes, administrative regulations, court rules, government policies, common law, or any other provisions or sources of law,  as are granted to and imposed upon spouses .  Given that domestic partners are treated in the exact same way as are married individuals and that they enjoy all the same rights and privileges as do married individuals, and for purposes of CA law, are TREATED exactly the same as married individuals, it's not exactly clear cut that 308.5 represents the "strong public policy" of California.   I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility for a CA court to rule that 308.5 is superseded by 297.5 and that, insofar as the difference between domestic partnership and marriage in CA seems to be one of name only--that it no longer falls under the public policy exception to the Full Faith and Credit clause.  As such, the CA court would be required to recognize the Massachusetts marriage.  DOMA is a Congressional attempt to legislate the public policy exception to the FFC with respect to same sex marriages.  However, if CA treats gay domestic partnerships AS marriage, then DOMA is either not applicable or is superseded by the Supremacy Clause and the FFC.  I see this scenario as quite plausible and I think it would be far more unlikely for a Supreme Court as currently constituted to reverse such a ruling. (So really, DOMA wouldn't be held unconstitutional in my example, just not applicable).  Where I AGREE with XRLQ is in the smacking he gives  urlLink Josh Chafetz at Oxblog  for the latter's fairly creative reading of Art III.

       urlLink Ace fo Spades  has a "scoop" of sorts. He writes:   Shortly after 9/11, some politician told the press about some phone conversation intercepted the day before, saying something like "The feast is set" or some other codephrase later determined to mean "the attack is on."  This was a bad thing, because the fact that we interecepted a call is itself a closely-guarded secret. I think Bush, Cheney, and/or Rumsfeld sternly rebuked Congress for this leak.  It was just leaked that a Senator is now the focus of investigation in the case. That Senator -- Richard Shelby of Alabama, on the Senate Intelligence Committee.  Republican.  Keith Olbermann reported this on his godawful show tonight.   Ace goes on to harangue the media for not doing the same questioning regarding the "timing" of the leak as they did with the Berger story.  I would agree but since the story broke on Keith Olbermann's show, I think it's safe to assume that nobody will ever hear of it.  Which leads to the question:   If a story breaks on a basic cable news show with a .2 rating, does anybody hear it?   I think we all know the answer.

      Via  urlLink Marzi  comes news that  urlLink Al-Jazeera will be given a place at the Demoratic Convention . My brain is working overtime trying to come up with a joke about this--but I can't quite do it.  So on a serious note--why do this?  To appeal to...Qatari voters?  Saudi voters?  So why do it? Marzi writes:   Al-Jazeera is a fundamentalist propaganda-spouting mouthpiece for terrorism and yet the DNC is treating the network like it's a legitimate media outlet.   Well, there's  that .  Though I think Marzi goes a bit too far when she writes:   To me, there is only *one* reason for it: the Democrats want to let the terrorists know that, dagnabbit, when *they're* in power, they're going to have a whole new Kumabatic relationship with them.  I don't think the message is to the terrorists per se, but rather to your average anti-american middle eastern thugocracies. It's a subtle difference (only a bomb or two), but it matters.  In other words, I think the DNC is doing this in order to placate the STATES in the region, rather than any individuals there.

      Reuters-- urlLink U.S. Pledges 50,000 Tons of Food to North Korea .    Part of me thinks this is a necessary action to prevent a human catastrophe on the Korean Penninsula.  The other part of me thinks that this only props up the NK regime longer so it can continue its repression and weaponization.    This has always been the problem I've had with "engagement" as a policy towards openly belligerent states.  Since engagement means essentially nothing more than the influx of American money/aid, it presents the distinct risk of doing nothing more than permitting the enemy state to cement its power base.  I mean, I understand the economic necessity of trading with China--but there's not a whole of evidence that China's slouching towards a more free-market system is doing anything to solve the political and religious oppression in the country.  Instead, all it's doing is providing the ChiComs with more capital by which any pro-democracy forces' bargaining powers are dramatically reduced and cementing the ChiComs power.  It's the reason I'm against lifting the embargo against Cuba since merely giving Castro more money with which he can oppress his people doesn't strike me as a great idea. After all, Cuba currently has access to the entire rest of the world's capital and it is STILL an oppressive shithole--how the magical tonic of AMERICAN capital help?  I don't think it will.  Such are my concerns with North Korea.

      For a good long while, one of the favorite whipping boys of the  urlLink anti-war left  was  urlLink Ahmed Chalabi .  And to an extent, not without reason.  Though he still has a handful of people that give him  urlLink qualified support , he sure isn't the centerpiece of the pro-war crowd that he once was (no more State of the Union boxseats for Ahmed).   The left took great glee in pointing up Chalabi as "evidence" of just how flawed the case for war was.  But in doing so, unbeknownst to all (esp.  urlLink Clueless John Kerry ), they also exposed themsevles to the same charges of using sources that might soon be...umm...compromised.   In the span of 2 weeks, we've seen the implosion of  urlLink Joe Wilson ,  urlLink Trousergate , and the release of the 9/11 report which thoroughly undercuts Richard Clarke's  urlLink twin claims  that there was no link between Al Qaeda and Iraq ( urlLink there   urlLink was ) and that the the Clinton Admin were anti-terror warriors while Bush & Co were nincompoops ( urlLink neither characterization is true ).  So now we have the 2 of the three biggest posterboys for the BUSH LIED!!! crowd having their central claims wholly blown out of the water such that Joe Wilson is  urlLink dodging interviews , and when he does show up it's with a  urlLink script firmly in hand  and  urlLink Richard Clarke is being....Richard Clarke .  Then there's  urlLink Berger .   Now, one could argue, I suppose, that Chalabi's claims were more damning since they led our country into war on arguably false information re: the extent of Saddam's weapons programs.  But think about this for a second--in light of all that has come out, we now know that (1) Saddam WAS seeking weaponizable uranium from Africa (Niger), (2) Iraq DID have extensive and fairly "friendly" contacts with Al Qaeda, and (3) the left either intentionally lied about this or were so willing to ignore these facts solely for the purpose of scoring a political victory.  That #3 is even plausible (neverminding the truth of it), disturbs me to no end.   Sorry, but whatever credibility problems Chalabi might have, they simply pale in comparison to a political movement that so willingly and brazenly places the national security of this country a distant second to scoring minor political points  urlLink with crap like this .

      I'd say this article from the  urlLink NYSun  fairly well typifies the fundamental bankruptcy of viewing our fight against terrorism as a law enforcement matter--and by extension the bankruptcy of the Kerry approach.   The report cites a 1998 meeting between Mr. Berger and the director of central intelligence, George Tenet, at which Mr. Tenet presented a plan to capture Osama bin Laden.       “In his meeting with Tenet, Berger focused most, however, on the question of what was to be done with Bin Ladin if he were actually captured. He worried that the hard evidence against Bin Ladin was still skimpy and that there was a danger of snatching him and bringing him to the United States only to see him acquitted,” the report says, citing a May 1, 1998, Central Intelligence Agency memo summarizing the weekly meeting between Messrs. Berger and Tenet.       In June of 1999, another plan for action against Mr. bin Laden was on the table. The potential target was a Qaeda terrorist camp in Afghanistan known as Tarnak Farms. The commission report released yesterday cites Mr. Berger’s “handwritten notes on the meeting paper” referring to “the presence of 7 to 11 families in the Tarnak Farms facility, which could mean 60-65 casualties.”According to the Berger notes, “if he responds, we’re blamed.”       On December 4, 1999, the National Security Council’s counterterrorism coordinator, Richard Clarke, sent Mr. Berger a memo suggesting a strike in the last week of 1999 against Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. Reports the commission: “In the margin next to Clarke’s suggestion to attack Al Qaeda facilities in the week before January 1, 2000, Berger wrote, ‘no.’ ”       In August of 2000, Mr. Berger was presented with another possible plan for attacking Mr. bin Laden.This time, the plan would be based on aerial surveillance from a “Predator” drone. Reports the commission: “In the memo’s margin,Berger wrote that before considering action, ‘I will want more than verified location: we will need, at least, data on pattern of movements to provide some assurance he will remain in place.’ ”    Trying to comprehend that? Well, here's the summary:   In other words, according to the commission report, Mr. Berger was presented with plans to take action against the threat of Al Qaeda four separate times — Spring 1998, June 1999, December 1999, and August 2000.   Remember, had that "curiously timed" leak about the DOJ investigation not come out--Berger could well have held such a position again.

       urlLink Spoons  has a good trouncing of  urlLink Sullivan's latest incoherence . On HR 3133 (written about by me  urlLink here  and  urlLink here )&nbsp;he writes:   The bill that passed yesterday singles out gay citizens and denies them access to the federal courts to defend their civil rights. The arguments are so transparent. Does the Defense of Marriage Act violate the constitution? Then amend the constitution, the Republicans say. If you cannot amend the constitution, knee-cap the courts.  ***  If the Republicans can do this to exclude gays from access to the courts, why couldn't Democrats one day do it to prevent conservative Christians?  Neverminding the fact that Sullivan either has not READ HR 3133 or is being willfully ignorant of what it says--the law does NOT deny gays and lesbians access to the courts. It denies  federal  courts, over which Congress has power under Art. III Sec 2, the ability to exercise appellate jurisdiction to hear cases interpreting DOMA.   But Sullivan is so blatantly hypocritical here it's staggering--first he claims to be a proponent of federalism (or at least tries to chide National Review for NOT being such); but then he implies that DOMA is unconstitutional. If he had not lost his intellectual honesty long ago, he'd realize that passing HR 3133 would still allow the STATE courts to rule on the constitutionality of DOMA.   Ultimately, California could determine that DOMA was unconstitutional under the 14th amendment or the Commerce Clause or the Takings Clause or whatever. And there would be no recourse to the Federal Courts since their appellate JDX would be no more. And Sullivan's dead horse could be spared another beating.   But Sullivan doesn't trust the states enough to accept this. No, he NEEDS an activist federal bench to serve as a safety net lest his hollow calls for "federalism for me but not for thee" fail.   After all, if Sullivan were serious about protecting a state's right to decide the matter--he should be all for removing any chance that a federal judge could interfere with that decision. But that would require Sullivan be honest. Instead, Sullivan wraps himself in the veil of federalism all the while holding out hope that DOMA will be ruled unconstitutional by a federal court.   In short, Sullivan is a hack--and a dishonest one at that.

      With the release of the 9/11 report, here's a sobering chronology of what happened on  urlLink Flight 93  from the NYT:   At three seconds after 10 a.m., Mr. Jarrah is heard on the cockpit voice recorder saying: "Is that it? Shall we finish it off?"  But another hijacker responds: "No. Not yet. When they all come, we finish it off."  The voice recorder captured sounds of continued fighting, and Mr. Jarrah pitched the plane up and then down. A passenger is heard to say, "In the cockpit. If we don't we'll die!"  Then a passenger yelled "Roll it!" Some aviation experts have speculated that this was a reference to a food cart, being used as a battering ram.  Mr. Jarrah "stopped the violent maneuvers" at 10:01:00, according to the report, and said, "Allah is the greatest! Allah is the greatest!"  "He then asked another hijacker in the cockpit, `Is that it? I mean, shall we put it down?' to which the other replied, `Yes, put it in it, and pull it down.' "  Eighty seconds later, a hijacker is heard to say, "Pull it down! Pull it down!"  "The hijackers remained at the controls but must have judged that the passengers were only seconds from overcoming them," according to the report, which seems to indicate that the hijackers themselves crashed the plane. "With the sounds of the passenger counterattack continuing, the aircraft plowed into an empty field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, at 580 miles per hour, about 20 minutes' flying time from Washington, D.C," according to the report.

      That's about the only conclusion one can reach after reading this absolutely incoherent article on HR 3313 titled-- urlLink House Votes to Curb Same-Sex Marriage .  Now I blogged about this bill  urlLink a week ago .  But heres how the AP reports it:   The House measure, also supported by the administration, offers a different approach. It would forbid federal judges from requiring one state to recognize a same-sex marriage licensed in another.  Wrong! You blithering sac of monkey dung. It would preclude federal courts from exercising appellate jurisdiction over DOMA.  The way the AP reports it, it sounds exactly like what DOMA does already.  Which is emphatically not the case.   As for the Constitutionality of the measure---eh, Art III, Section 2:   In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact,  with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.    But here's what I love:   "This debate is about a national election," Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, said in opposing the bill. "We are playing with fire with this bill, and that fire could destroy the nation we love."  "I rise in defense of the Constitution, in defense of the separation of powers," said House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat. "What's next? No judicial review of laws that restrict freedom of speech or religion?"  Apparently Congress exercising one of its Constitutionally granted powers is somehow a threat to the Constitution. I can't even wrap my head around THAT one.   Now, if you want to argue that this bill is a bad idea POLITICALLY, fine.  That's a different debate though. But to argue that:   the bill would violate the equal protection clause by cutting off from federal judicial review a law affecting a specific minority.   That's just goofy.  So lemme get this straight--presuming that DOMA is itself constitutional and not violative of the Equal Protection clause, how could a law which, in line with Congressional authority, limits the federal courts' appellate jurisdiction over interpretations of that constitutional DOMA itself be violative of the 14th?  Don't those who argue that HR 3313 violates the EP clause paint themselves into the corner of saying that DOMA also violates EP? And if that's the case--why not just challenge DOMA directly?

      What happens when you ask several non-American sports "experts" if Lance Armstrong's soon to be sixth straight Tour victory is  urlLink one of the greatest achievements in the history of sport ?  Some really curious answers. Must be a geographical thing.  Ok, so in weighing Lance's achievements, he must contend with the likes of:  BRIAN LARA'S 400  The greatest sporting achievement I have witnessed would definitely be the 400 not out scored by Brian Lara in Antigua during England's tour there in the winter. Lara was a previous record holder of the highest test score with 375 against England in 1994, which was beaten by Matthew Hayden last year. The first innings of 375 was again in Antigua and I was on the opposing side.  What is phenomenal about the 400 is that a batsman has the determination and concentration to break the record twice. It requires two solid days at the crease and there must be the huge temptation to try and do it all a bit quicker than the last time, at which stage you'll make a mistake.  Brian Lara is such a special player because he has the eye for the ball and the flair as well as powers of concentration. You can't really match what he has achieved in cricket, although in bowling terms I guess that Jim Laker's 19 wickets in the Test match against Australia at Old Trafford in 1956 comes very close.  I don't even know what these words MEAN.  Though, to be fair, the article does include more recognizeable names like Ali (for his comeback) and Pele (for playing lots of soccer I guess).  Then there's something about Bob Champion...who was apparently a very good "jump jockey."

       urlLink Clarke Critcized Comm'n .   WASHINGTON A former counter-terrorism chief in the Clinton and Bush administrations is critical of the Nine-Eleven commission's findings.  Richard Clarke, who is now an A-B-C consultant, says the panel avoided controversy by omitting important factors.  Among the important factors omitted:  (1) How Richard Clarke, despite protestations from all corners of gov't, through cunning analysis and a take charge attitude, single-handedly foiled the millenium terror plot by personally hiring the intrepid border guard that caught the potential bombers.  (2) How Richard Clarke, despite protestations from all corners of gov't, through cunning analysis and a take charge attitude, single-handedly foiled the collapse of the WTC by flying around the earth's axis backwards, reversing time such that he was able to single-handedly, through cunning analysis and a take charge attitude, bitch slap Mohammed Atta into submission.

      The case of the Ham-Berg(l)er gets weirder and weirder as Nat'l Archive staff were apparently  urlLink keeping a close watch over Sandy's actions .    The government source said the Archives employees were deferential toward Berger, given his prominence, but were worried when he returned to view more documents on Oct. 2. They devised a coding system and marked the documents they knew Berger was interested in canvassing, and watched him carefully. They knew he was interested in all the versions of the millennium review, some of which bore handwritten notes from Clinton-era officials who had reviewed them. At one point an Archives employee even handed Berger a coded draft and asked whether he was sure he had seen it.   At the end of the day, Archives employees determined that that draft and all four or five other versions of the millennium memo had disappeared from the files, this source said.   Meanwhile, the  urlLink New Republic's Martin Peretz weighs in :  I confess: I do not like Sandy Berger; and I have not liked him since the first time we met, long ago during the McGovern campaign, not because of his politics since I more or less shared them then, but for his hauteur. He clearly still has McGovernite politics, which means, in my mind, at least, that he believes there is no international dispute that can't be solved by the U.S. walking away from it. No matter. Still, here's his story about the filched classified materials dealing with the foiled Al Qaeda millennium terrorist bombing plot from the National Archives: He inadvertently took home documents and notes about documents that he was not permitted to take from the archives; secondly, he inadvertently didn't notice the papers in his possession when he got home and actually looked at them; and, thirdly, he inadvertently discarded some of these same files so that they are now missing.  I eagerly await Mort Kondracke's eating of crow as this story seems to move well beyond mere sloppiness or an innocent mistake.   UPDATE:  urlLink Michelle Malkin  has yet another in the long line of bad puns coming out of this story.

       urlLink SlingsAndArrows  notes this  urlLink LAT story  on the difficulties the UN is having in getting troops to protect its own people in Iraq.  Bryon writes:   Every week it becomes clearer that had Bush done what his critics wanted, Saddam would still be in power, people would still be dying, oil-for-money hands would still be getting greased, and families of Palestinian bombers would still be getting lucrative checks.   Clearly he does not value the PROCESS.  Silly naive little American.   On a more serious note, from the article:   If other countries are unable to provide the troops, the job will fall to the U.S.-led coalition now patrolling the country. That outcome would be embarrassing for the Bush administration, which has been struggling all year to show it has international support for rebuilding Iraq.  Why?! Why would it be embarrassing for the Bush administration? Why wouldn't it be a supreme embarassment for the UN?  For all the hectoring us conservatives rec'v when we dare question the infallible wisdom of Kofi and Co., you'd think that when they can't fulfill one of their BASIC functions (aside from condemning Israel), that they'd be rightly dismissed as yet another wholly worthless attempt at collective security.

      Kevin at  urlLink RantMeARiver  has a lengthy post about a meeting he had with a former Marine helicopter pilot:   What he said that really stuck with me was that since World War II, American political leaders, not American warriors, have lacked the will to fight war the way it needed to be fought to minimize American casualties over the long term -- by winning the war. The 1991 Gulf War is the closest we've come, and even then, the C-in-C ("Poppy" Bush) left the job half-done. Every time he reads or hears about another two Marines or five "Grunts" bleeding out in Iraq as the result of another IED, it infuriates and saddens him.   Kevin also quotes Mark Bowden's  urlLink Black Hawk Down   on the importance of getting the other side to back down.  I've often thought this was a conceit of well-to-do Western societies that non-western societies can be either reasoned with or hurt JUST ENOUGH such that they'll realize the futility of future belligerence.  But this is ultimately just that, a conceit.  And a delusional one at that.  Societies generally don't enter war lightly.  They do so because they believe it is in their best interest and having made that decision--are generally reluctant to give up, especially at the first setback (i.e. American bombs).    You don't send your young men off to die without some belief that you'll get something out of it.  While an affluent West has far more to lose and can generally be expected to pull back lest things get too "hot"--underdeveloped countries, whose sole export is angry young men, will not be so easily dissuaded.  This is not to say such socities can't be defeated.  Far from it. People are, despite ample evidence suggesting otherwise, rational beings.   But to defeat such societies that have invested their entire outputs into conducting war, you must actually DEFEAT them.  This doesn't mean victory on the battlefield alone--it requires a different sort of "hearts and minds" where the offending society is defeated so completely, so thoroughly, that the very thought of reigniting hostilities brings down more scorn and derision from members of one's OWN society than anywhere else.  Humiliation can be a remarkably useful tool.  It may be harsh to say, but Sherman was completely correct when he vowed to make Georgia howl.  For that was the only way to divest a Southern Confederacy of the will to fight.  Did it breed resentment for decades afterwards? Undoubtedly, but the one thing it didn't breed was continued fighting--for people feared what the devil Sherman might do.   This was always my biggest complain about the Powell Doctrine.  Oftentimes, limited objectives only forestall a larger, more acrimonious conflict.  Since the defeated country now has a serious grievance with which to enrage scores of young angry men as to their claims "by right" of territory they were pushed out from.  Policymakers should not be so coy with using humiliation as a tool in warfare--since an enemy with a broken back is far less likely to be a problem than one with merely a black eye.

       urlLink LAT--Grand Jury Steps Up Inquiry Into Possible Halliburton Ties to Iran .   The investigation centers on Halliburton Products and Services Ltd., a subsidiary registered in the Cayman Islands and headquartered in Dubai that provided oil field services in Iran. The unit's operations in Iran included Cheney's stint as chief executive from 1995 to 2000, when he frequently urged the lifting of such sanctions.         Numerous U.S. companies operate in Iran, but under strict guidelines requiring that their subsidiaries have a foreign registry and no U.S. employees, and that they act independently of the parent company.   At issue is whether Halliburton's subsidiary met those criteria.  Certainly sounds like an interesting story until you realize that the article doesn't tell you WHAT Halliburton is specifically alleged to have done.  There's no discussion of the what specifically the sanctions prohibit and what actions by Halliburton's subsidiary are alleged to have been in violation of those sanctions.  Which would've been nice....

      From the  urlLink Scotsman :  She was beautiful and blonde and wearing a blue US Olympic team tracksuit. Which is why the night security guard gave the willowy American a key to the secured roof of a dormitory in the athlete village of a recent summer Olympiad. The roof offered privacy; the sort of privacy she and her new friends, waiting in the shadows, were looking for. But after she and the four rowers from the German men’s heavyweight eight stepped out into the open air, high above the buzzing village, they realised they’d be in full view of the other dorms across the way. Whether it was the moonlight or the alcohol or the warm summer breezes blowing across the rooftops, though, none of the athletes hesitated.   Fellow Olympians who may have caught sight of the activity from nearby towers would not have been terribly surprised. Wild behaviour is nothing new to the Games, where extraordinary performance has never been limited to the fields of play. Part marketing blitz, part political stagecraft and part ritualised battle, the Olympics are also, at their core, a spectacular physical display: 10,000 examples of the perfect human form, in motion. It’s the reason the original Olympians in ancient Greece competed nude.   It goes on describing the Bacchanlia that is the athletes' village.

       urlLink Torerolaw  notes this  urlLink NYT story  where dozens of countries filed amicus briefs challenging the death sentence of a 17 year old Missouri male convicted of murder. Lest you think the offender is some waywayrd soul, from the article:   Christopher Simmons was 17 on Sept. 8, 1993, when he and a 15-year-old accomplice broke into a house in the St. Louis area to commit a burglary. The homeowner, Shirley Crook, recognized Mr. Simmons; by chance, she and Mr. Simmons had been involved in a car crash.  Prosecutors said Mr. Simmons bound, gagged and blindfolded Mrs. Crook, 46, with the help of the 15-year-old, drove her around in her minivan, and beat and retied her when she tried to break free. Mr. Simmons, now 27, pushed her off a railroad trestle to drown in a river.   Torerolaw notes that objections to Simmons' death sentence based solely on his age are missing the mark:   He was 17. How close to you have to be to 18 in order to know right and wrong. What if Simmons killed this woman the day before his 18th birthday? Is there really any mental, developmental, or maturity difference? Of course not. The age of 18 is just an arbitrary age in which the government says you're an adult. That is why, courts should decide whether to impose the death penalty for people under 18 case by case.   This is undoubtedly true--there's nothing inherently unique about turning 18 that imbues an individual with all the mental faculties of a 35 year old.  As such, to say that simply because Simmons was 17 at the time doesn't answer the question.  At 17, he could have been in as much control over his actions and as premeditating a dickhead as a Jeffrey Dahmer.  18 IS nothing more than an arbitrary line drawn by our society.  It serves as a STARTING point in determining culpability--not an end point.  We've chosen 18 as the age of majority because, for whatever reason, people under that age TEND to be immature and arguably less than culpable.  However, that this is the tendency of people under 18 doesn't make it the inviolable rule.  There will always be exceptions to such a determination.  On the other side though, what's the purpose of drawing such a line between majority/minority if it can be stepped over in certain cases?  The easiest response to this is that we're only doing it in cases of heinous crimes.  And once 14 yr olds are being held liable for contracts they enter, then there will be a problem.  Until then, determining culpability on a case-by-case basis seems the best approach.  Torero also worries about how effective these appeals from the "international community" will be on a Court that has already expressed a desire to follow at least SOME of the norms of such legal luminaries as Mexico and Belgium.    I second his worries.

       urlLink BoiFromTroy  recounts a conversation he had with a particular lefty friend:   I had a lengthy discussion driving back from Ginger Rogers Beach in Santa Monica a couple weeks ago with a friend who insists that "Bush Lied!!!" about Iraq causing 9-11. I walked him though what was said...  Bush stated truthfully that Al Qaeda was behind 9-11. Bush stated truthfully that there were connections between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's regime.   People inferred that Saddam's regime was behind 9-11 and attributed their thoughts to Bush...and when that was "disproven" by the 9-11 Commission, then naturally, "Bush Lied!!!"  While he's on to something re: the inanity of the whole "GOP mindgames" that Al Gore was talking about recently--I think BFT misses something here though.  I'll 'esplain:  To offer as a defense of the administration that the admin can't be held responsible for what (rational) inferences can be drawn from their statements is the same defense Michael Moore offers for his clusterf*** of a movie.  While it's true that Moore utters very few out and out falsehoods, his method is to selectively present facts such that the most rational inference for an uninformed viewer is to reach the conclusion that Moore wishes you to.  That method, while internally consistent and essentially true in the details--gets the big truths very very wrong.  For example, I could use the exact same method to prove, without printing one untrue statement, that the South won the Civil War or that the Axis won WWII.    So in that sense, saying "it's not our fault people inferred this" is a cop-out. But ultimately, that isn't a problem since the Administration went out of its way to repeatedly and consistently state that they had no evidence of Iraqi involvement in 9/11.  The most that can be said to counter that is that when pressed, brought up the Czech report of Atta meeting an IIS official in Prague before the attacks (something the Czechs still stick by).  And bear in mind, each time that bit of information was brought up, it was in the context of asserting that that was the ONLY bit of information the Admin had linking Iraq to 9/11.  In summary: You can't absolve the Admin by claiming they aren't responsible for the inferences drawn from official statements--but you can absolve them when they explicitly and expressly counter the inference drawn (thereby making the inference no longer logical/rational).

       urlLink Link.   A spokeswoman for the French government said, according to agency reports, "a possible visit by the Israeli prime minister to Paris, for which no date has been set, will be examined only when the explanations called for have been provided".  *** Sharon's comments were roundly condemned by Jewish groups throughout France as, in the words of one Jewish leader, "pouring oil on the fire." The number of anti-Semitic events in France has risen sharply in the first half of this year.    No word on whether Chirac's comments extended to all Jews.  But so I'm clear--in an attempt to combat anti-semitism in France you should avoid, at all costs, accusing others of anti-semitism, lest they...ummm...engage in anti-semitic behavior?  That's almost a good idea.

      Ok, the report of  urlLink Sandy Berger being the subject of a DOJ criminal investigation  for the apparent wrongful (though unclear if intentional) removal of classified terroism docs is all over the blog world right now.   Berger's home and office were searched earlier this year by FBI agents armed with warrants after he voluntarily returned documents to the National Archives. However, still missing are some drafts of a sensitive after-action report on the Clinton administration's handling of al-Qaida terror threats during the December 1999 millennium celebration.   Berger and his lawyer said Monday night he knowingly removed handwritten notes he had made while reading classified anti-terror documents at the archives by sticking them in his jacket and pants. He also inadvertently took copies of actual classified documents in a leather portfolio, they said.   While I am inclined to give Berger the benefit of the doubt, things like this do not instill confidence:   When asked, Berger said he returned some classified documents that he found in his office and all of the handwritten notes he had taken from the secure room, but could not locate two or three copies of the highly classified millennium terror report.   While normally I'd be quick to question how the media would report this, the fact that the AP is breaking the story as an exclusive places it in a different light than would a run of the mill story with a buried lede (lead?).  As of right now, we'll just have to wait and see.  I have nothing meaningful to add--I just couldn't resist the title of this post...

       urlLink BoiFromTroy  has many problems with this  urlLink LA Times op-ed  which places journos well above bloggers on the informational foodchain. In particular, BFT disagrees with this statement:   However, bloggers, with few exceptions, don't add reporting to the personal views they post online, and they see journalism as bound by norms and standards that they reject. That encourages these common attributes of the blogosphere: vulgarity, scorching insults, bitter denunciations, one-sided arguments, erroneous assertions and the array of qualities that might be expected from a blustering know-it-all in a bar.     BFT argues that bloggers are often on top of stories long before the print media and that blogs are better able to draw on a variety of sources that the LAT can't do (such as another paper's reporting).  I think, though, that BFT misses the mark somewhat--Jones, the author of the piece, DOES acknowledge that there are exceptions to the general rule that bloggers don't add original reporting. I think this is largely true.  That most bloggers aren't getting the "scoops" doesn't mean that all bloggers lack original content.  After all, take a look at any collecting of links on a given blogroll--they will typically be of the same ideolgical stripe as the blog's proprietor, and typically all be talking about the same stories.  It's rare that a blogger has the resources or the contacts to ADD something to a given story.  Bloggers are there more to focus the debate and to serve as a check on the rhetorical excesses of the mainstream media.  But ultimately, they are parasitic on that media.  After all, if there weren't a New York Times or Maureen Dowd, would half of blogger-dom exist in its remotely current form? Nope. So insofar as Jones' basic thesis is that blogging is dependent on big media for its existence, I think that's basically correct.   Again, this is not to say that bloggers add nothing--quite the contrary; if the media is the "4th branch of gov't" then blogging is the "check and balance" on that branch.  Admittedly, it's got a long way to go--but it does have a role.  And a valuable one at that.  Now, the problem I have with Jones is that he places journalism on a very undeserved pedastal.  Since the '60s, the notion that journalism can be "objective" has gained so much momentum that editors and program managers go apopleptic when they are accused of having a bias or agenda.  I long for the days when you could reliably count on the local Democratic rag to denounce the greedy Republicans while the Republican rag would lay into the rapacious Democrats.  But with the rise of "respectable" journalism and one paper towns, you lost that competition and major cities like Los Angeles are left with the  urlLink Dog Trainer  and nothing else.  It'd be far healthier for the republic if journalists and their lobbyists (can YOU think of a better word?) would drop this veneer of objectivity and simply have at thee.  Since the bizarro kabuki dance of denial big media does when confronted with the painful evidence of its utter lack of objectivity is just painful to watch.  In other words, journalists and bloggers are two sides of the same coin.  Bloggers wear their agendas on their sleeves (or blogrolls). Journalists just tend to have larger rolodexes and expense accounts.

       urlLink Raincross Conservative  points to this  urlLink AP article  noting the potential changes that Arnold's term could have on the political makeup of the state of CA.  Raincross notes:   I like the article, but I wished it would have mentioned the changing party affiliations in the state. In 2000 there were 11 percent more Democrats than Republicans in California. Now the gap is down to seven percent and could be even smaller in the years to come. This would have a dramatic effect on the state's political landscape.  Everytime I read about how Democratic CA has become, I can't help but think back to 1992 and the truly monumental effect that Ross Perot had on the American political landscape.  Think about it: California, the largest single electoral prize in the game--without which the Democrats could NEVER win the presidency was, for decades, as staunchly Republican as a state so varied could be (with the exception of Johnson's win in '64).  Now, CA is the lynchpin for the Democrats. But this wasn't always so:   1980  Reagan-- 4,524,858 Carter-- 3,862,244   1984  Reagan-- 5,305,410 Mondale--3,815,947   1988  Bush--   5,054,917 Dukakis- 4,702,233  Then came 1992.  In 1992, Ross Perot effectively split the Republican vote and this was especially true in CA:  Clinton--5,121,325 Bush--   3,630,575 Perot--  2,296,006  So instead of a staunchly Republican state--Perot effectively killed CA for the Republicans, such that Dole was thoroughly trounced in '96.  Not only did Perot help give CA to the Democrats--but by siphoning so many votes off the Republican party, he took CA off the table as even a BATTLEGROUND state.  The CA GOP is a farce and Bush is, understandably, spending no money in the state since he's unlikely to make up the 1.3 million votes he lost CA by in 2000.  Now, imagine how hamstrung the Dems would be if they had to actually FIGHT for CA?  They'd have nothing left to spend anywhere else.  It almost brings a tear to your eye.  DAMN YOU ROSS PEROT!

      Via  urlLink Wizbang  comes the latest tale of the tape on the juggernaut that is Air America.  (more detailed analysis at  urlLink LeatherPenguin )  Ok, so I think it's fair to say the AA is something of a dead fish. This leads me to ponder something I've been a-ponderin' for some time.  The left has a tendency to create these organizations and outlets as reactions to perceived conservative dominance and they almost uniformly  urlLink r teh suck . Below is a list of some of the areas which the left has felt a need to imitate and their respective outlets for doing so...poorly.   urlLink Conservative   urlLink Talk   urlLink Radio  too dominant?  Let's start  urlLink Air America    urlLink Federalist Society  too powerful? Well, there's always the  urlLink American Constitution Society . (which has a  urlLink blog  apparently)   urlLink Heritage Foundation  and/or  urlLink CATO Institute  getting too much airtime? Then the  urlLink Center for American Progess  may be for you.   urlLink Media Research Center  giving you fits? There's always  urlLink Media Matters  or  urlLink FAIR .  Ok, here's the problem that these groups and their backers seem to not quite grasp--the reason conservatives have come to dominate these admittedly minor areas of the national media and dialogue is because they themselves were reactions to a mainstream establishment media that was giving short shrift to conservative views.    Does anyone think that if you had a paper with the influence of the NYT but with the editorial slant of say, the Washington Times or WSJ, that Rush would be as popular as he is? Not a chance.  Conservatives flocked to these sources because they COULDN'T get their opinions heard on the nightly news. The Federalist Society formed primarily because there was such a dearth of nominally "conservative" lawyers and professors in the upper echelons of the legal profession.  These groups will survive though--their backers will take sufficient pity upon them to keep them around in varying forms for years.  But will they ever be the central hubs for liberal thought that the Federailst Society is for lawyers or that talk radio is for a cure for the mainstream media? No--why? Because those appetites are more than satisfied elsewhere.  And in light of Air America's anemic ratings--one wonders why they keep trying.

      Via  urlLink OTB  comes  urlLink this article by Michael Kinsley  weighing the benefits/negatives of reinstituting the draft.   Aside from the obvious questions re: the quality of conscripted troops (any cursory reading of US military history shows that regular (volunteer) troops are far and away better at what they do than draftees)--my problem with calls for a new draft stem from the problem of the inherent notions of classism inherent in such calls.  As I understand it, proponents of the draft want the sons of the rich (and less than rich) to "share the burden" by being required to serve alongside the ignorant, benighted, and unwashed masses.  I use these terms since that's the general view proponents of the draft have towards those that currently volunteer.  But suppose we bring back the draft--will that really "spread the burden" an appreciable amount?  Assuming that the practice of granting deferments for those in college or those pursuing careers deemed more beneficial to the economy than what they could offer in the military--you'll still have a disproportionate number of the upper middle and upper class being able to "avoid" the draft since these groups attend college and professional schools at higher rates.  If the proponents of the draft seek to also remove any chance of deferment--well, that's always an option--not a real good one--but it's there.  But I'm not exactly convinced that that's remotely a good idea.

      Finished  urlLink Fields of Battle  late last night. Overall, I enjoyed the book.  Although the title is a little misleading--it really should be called "The Forts of North America" since the general theme of the book is attempts by the various powers (French in Canada, British Colonials, Southern Confederacy, US Army against the Plains Indians) to fortify their positions throughout the continent.  Keegan is clearly enamored with America and indeed, Americans.  The first 60 pages or so is a travelogue memoir of sorts where he recounts his first visit to America and his first experiences with them as a boy during WWII in London.  I think it's safe to say this isn't as rigorously a scholarly work as some of his earlier (or later) efforts--it's more of an extended love letter to the continent from a military historian.  This is evidenced by the lack of footnotes and bibliography.  That's not to say it's bad by any means. But this book is more "light history" than some of Keegan's earlier work.    That being said, I might actually prefer it when Keegan writes this way.  For my part, Keegan writes best when he isn't bogged down in "rivet counting" (something he's been accused of in the past) and just tells the story of the particular battle/conflict he's addressing.   He does that here with the Civil War (which focuses primarily on McClellan's Peninsular Campaign) and Custer's Last Stand.  These chapters really shine.  His chapters covering the Seven Years War between France and Britain, culminating in the taking of Quebec by Wolfe in 1759, and the American Revolution are a little harder to become invested in.  This might be a feature of my not being as knowledgable about those conflicts as I am about the Civil War--so I was unable to invest the names and units with the personalities that I can with the Civil War sections.  Nevertheless, Keegan does a fine job of noting how important the geography of America is in the continent's wars (though the War of 1812 is absent unfortunately).  Especially noteworthy is the overlap between the battles of the American Revolution in Virginia with the Peninsular Campaign of the Civil War.  So often did the fortifications and strategic hubs of one war resume their military importance in the next.   While there are some factual errors (such as having Albert Sidney Johnston order a retreat on the 2nd day of Shiloh--even though he was killed on the first day)--they are minor, or I'm just too dumb to notice them.  All in all, I enjoyed the book and Keegan's affinity for America is readily apparent (as is his fairly strong rejection of the "sympathetic" view of the Plains Indians--they WERE quite brutal).  While not comprehensive in any sense for any of the conflicts presented, it is an interesting and engaging book.  Up next? More  urlLink Richard Sharpe .

      Sometimes irony can be pretty darn ironic.  This is especially true as one reads this NYT story on how  urlLink utterly nasty San Francisco's United Nations Promenade has become .  A report on United Nations Plaza to the county board of supervisors last year listed a litany of woes, including human waste on the plaza, gang activity and drug sales, that discouraged people from visiting the area. Riders of the regional subway system, Bay Area Rapid Transit, even avoided walking through the plaza to reach the Civic Center station, the report said. *** Instead, beyond the intersection at Fifth Street, the street turns into a seedy mix of sex shops and vacant storefronts, where it is not uncommon to find mentally ill or drunken people carrying on conversations with themselves or stumbling bleary-eyed across the sidewalk. Mr. Halprin, who has worked on plans over the years to revitalize Market Street, said no one had come up with a good explanation for the street's stubborn resistance to greatness.  That this has happened in hyper-tolerant San Francisco makes it all the sweeter.  Of course, some might question the priorities of some of Frisco's residents:   "The U.N. needs strengthening all around the block, as far as I am concerned," said Mr. Halprin, who is 88. "The first thing is to get the hell out of Iraq. The second thing to do is this."  But in the meantime, I shall chuckle heartily and conclude that God does have a sense of humor.

      Via  urlLink The Corner &nbsp;comes  urlLink this disturbing tale :   Now I'm 34. My boyfriend, Peter, and I have been together three years. I'm old enough to presume that I wasn't going to have an easy time becoming pregnant. I was tired of being on the pill, because it made me moody. Before I went off it, Peter and I talked about what would happen if I became pregnant, and we both agreed that we would have the child.   I found out I was having triplets when I went to my obstetrician. The doctor had just finished telling me I was going to have a low-risk pregnancy. She turned on the sonogram machine. There was a long pause, then she said, ''Are you sure you didn't take fertility drugs?'' I said, ''I'm positive.'' Peter and I were very shocked when she said there were three. ''You know, this changes everything,'' she said. ''You'll have to see a specialist.''   My immediate response was, I cannot have triplets. I was not married; I lived in a five-story walk-up in the East Village; I worked freelance; and I would have to go on bed rest in March. I lecture at colleges, and my biggest months are March and April. I would have to give up my main income for the rest of the year. There was a part of me that was sure I could work around that. But it was a matter of, Do I want to?   I looked at Peter and asked the doctor: ''Is it possible to get rid of one of them? Or two of them?'' The obstetrician wasn't an expert in selective reduction, but she knew that with a shot of potassium chloride you could eliminate one or more.   Having felt physically fine up to this point, I got on the subway afterward, and all of a sudden, I felt ill. I didn't want to eat anything. What I was going through seemed like a very unnatural experience. On the subway, Peter asked, ''Shouldn't we consider having triplets?'' And I had this adverse reaction: ''This is why they say it's the woman's choice, because you think I could just carry triplets. That's easy for you to say, but I'd have to give up my life.'' Not only would I have to be on bed rest at 20 weeks, I wouldn't be able to fly after 15. I was already at eight weeks. When I found out about the triplets, I felt like: It's not the back of a pickup at 16, but now I'm going to have to move to Staten Island. I'll never leave my house because I'll have to care for these children.  This is a "values" debate worth having...

      Since the 9/11 Commission will report that there are  urlLink fairly sizeable ties betwerrn Iran and AQ , including information given to some of the 9/11 hijakcers (though not about the attacks themselves), this places the Democrats in a curious position.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Both Kerry and Edwards have described the war in Iraq as "needless."&nbsp; Presumably they will try to use the 9/11 report to bolster their claims that the US went to war with the wrong country.&nbsp; However, by claiming that Iraq was the "wrong" country--that necessitates that one believes there was a "right" country for the US&nbsp;to go to war with (assuming you're not a pacifist).&nbsp;&nbsp;And it's not bloody likely that Kedwards will become terribly hawkish when it comes to Iran. &nbsp; That being said, I don't believe that Kedwards can make much political hay out of the 9/11 report on this point since any attempts to sound hawkish towards Iran will either (1) ring hollow in comparison to their earlier statements, (2) directly contradict those earlier claims or (3) alienate the hard left segment of their base by appearing more hawkish. &nbsp; So what CAN the Dems do with this?&nbsp; Well, they can try to distance themselves from the "with us/against us" policy of the Bush doctrine and then call for more "diplomatic" pressures on Iran.&nbsp; But that runs the risk of making the Dems appear REAL soft on the matter--after all, you can argue that Iraq's ties weren't strong enough--but where Iran's ties are even stronger, "containment" in a post 9/11 world doesn't really fly. &nbsp; So my ultimate conclusion, backed up by nothing in particular, is that this revelation by the 9/11 commission will not help the Dems all that much. &nbsp;

      Ok, my concern is this--most of Bush's speeches these days center on justifying of his decision to go to war with the information that he had  at the time .   But I'm still not sure what his answer is to whether, knowing what we know now re: WMD (no stockpiles, flawed intel), would he still have gone to war? My gut says he'd say yes given the links to AQ, but I'm not sure if that's politically wise--not sure it's UNWISE, but just throwing it out there.  &nbsp;  Does saying he would not have invaded invalidate the case for war?&nbsp; I don't really think so--it certainly doesn't HELP though since so much of the public case was based on the presence of WMD (IMO, the war was still justified on other grounds, but I'm just concerned with how it all "looks")  &nbsp;  On the other side, doesn't saying he WOULD have invaded make him APPEAR (at least to some) as if he was obsessed with Iraq when there were arguably better (?) candidates for targeting ( urlLink Iran for example ).  &nbsp;  I don't doubt this question will come up in the debates, and I'm honestly unsure of how Bush will answer it or what the collective reaction will be.  &nbsp;  (this post was prompted by this  urlLink excellent post  from  urlLink PatioPundit  trying to discern what Kerry's position would have been with the info available at the time)

      Via  urlLink Right Side of the Rainbow &nbsp;comes this story of the House Cmte on the Judiciary approving  urlLink HR 3313 , which would seek to strip all federal courts of the power to interpret DOMA as well as preclude the Supreme Court from exercising appellate jurisdiction over such as case.&nbsp; The bill reads:      Sec. 1632. Limitation on jurisdiction    `No court created by Act of Congress shall have any jurisdiction, and the Supreme Court shall have no appellate jurisdiction, to hear or determine any question pertaining to the interpretation of section 1738c of this title or of this section. Neither the Supreme Court nor any court created by Act of Congress shall have any appellate jurisdiction to hear or determine any question pertaining to the interpretation of section 7 of title 1.'.    urlLink Article III, Sec 1  permits the Congress to ordain and establish Courts inferior to the Supreme Court (I.E. Circuit and District courts).  urlLink Article III Sec 2 &nbsp;defines the scope of judicial power:      The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority;--to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls;--to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction;--to controversies to which the United States shall be a party;--to controversies between two or more states;--  urlLink  between a state and citizens of another state   ;--between citizens of different states;--between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states, and between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects.    The Court has original JDX:&nbsp;    In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.  Ok, can Congress do this? My sense is yeah.&nbsp; The Founding Fathers were concerned that an overpowerful judiciary might impede upon the power of state courts--so, as with every other branch, they sharply limited the powers that particular branch had.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there needed to be a court that could serve as a neutral arbiter between states or citizens of states and to resolve questions of federal law.  &nbsp;  The Congress can limit the appellate JDX of the Court under the enumerated cases or controversies listed above.&nbsp; The cases where the Court has original JDX are, obviously, not subject to limitation.&nbsp; Everything else though, is fair game for Congress to expand or contract.&nbsp; This includes "federal questions" where the interpretation of a federal statute is at issue.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  In short, the Congress CAN decide to deny the federal courts (incl. the Supreme Court) the jurisdiction to hear a particular case arising under federal law. As they have done here.&nbsp; DOMA is federal law.&nbsp; Any cases challenging it are necessarily involve questions of federal law.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The power to so limit the federal courts' appellate JDX is one of the "exceptions...as the Congress shall make."  &nbsp;  But here's a wrinkle--the law has no power over STATE courts.&nbsp; Suppose a state court (California for example) rules that DOMA is inconsistent with the CA Constitution or some other sort of ruling that seeks to invalidate DOMA.&nbsp; Under this new law, NO federal court would have the power to challenge that ruling--since the aggrieved party would have no recourse into federal court.&nbsp; Indeed, the case could not be removed to ANY federal court for the same reason.  &nbsp;  Assuming then, that this proposed law is constitutional, does it have a chance in hell of getting out of the Senate Judiciary Cmte? Nope.&nbsp; Does it have a chance in hell of passing the Senate? Nope.&nbsp; But it's a fun law nonetheless.

       urlLink Allawi introduces amnesty, shuts down al-Jazeera    The amnesty would forgive those who committed small crimes between May 1, 2003 -- just after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime -- and August 7, 2004, according to Allawi. Those eligible would need to turn themselves in over the next 30 days, he said.   ***  Also Saturday, Allawi announced that the Baghdad offices of Arab television station Al-Jazeera would be closed for 30 days.

       urlLink Jack at Tigerhawk  has more with relevant links:   Almost a year ago, the BBC reported the return of fourteen Europeans, mostly Germans, whom Islamist jihadists had held hostage in Algeria for five months in 2003. It was not clear why the hostages had been released, but there were rumors that the Germans had laundered a hefty ransom through the government of Mali  ***  The Germans paid off terrorists, but tried to keep that fact a secret. In so doing they paid jihadists money to purchase weapons and ammunition. They also taught the jihadists that the taking of hostages would be an effective strategy against wealthy Western democracies. This story is astonishing, and there has been virtually no coverage of it in the American press. Why? Because it might reinforce the impression many of us have that certain erstwhile allies cannot be trusted.  With allies like these...

      Ok, the  urlLink  Boston Globe   story says this about George Elliott:   The affidavit also contradicted earlier statements by Elliott, who came to Boston during Kerry's 1996 Senate campaign to defend Kerry on similar charges, saying that Kerry acted properly and deserved the Silver Star.  I did some NEXIS-ing and found a total of four stories that mention George Elliott in the same story as John Kerry.  First is is dated  Boston Globe June 16, 2003:  HEROISM, AND GROWING CONCERN ABOUT WAR BY MICHAEL KRANISH  --relevant passage is:    When Kerry returned to his base, his commanding officer, George Elliott, raised an issue with Kerry: the fine line between whether the action merited a medal or a court-martial.  "When [Kerry] came back from the well-publicized action where he beached his boat in middle of ambush and chased a VC around a hootch and ended his life, when [Kerry] came back and I heard his debrief, I said, 'John, I don't know whether you should be court-martialed or given a medal, court-martialed for leaving your ship, your post,' " Elliott recalled in an interview.  "But I ended up writing it up for a Silver Star, which is well deserved, and I have no regrets or second thoughts at all about that," Elliott said. A Silver Star, which the Navy said is its fifth-highest medal, commends distinctive gallantry in action.  Asked why he had raised the issue of a court-martial, Elliott said he did so "half tongue-in-cheek, because there was never any question I wanted him to realize I didn't want him to leave his boat unattended. That was in context of big-ship Navy - my background. A C.O. [commanding officer] never leaves his ship in battle or anything else. I realize this, first of all, it was pretty courageous to turn into an ambush even though you usually find no more than two or three people there. On the other hand, on an operation some time later, down on the very tip of the peninsula, we had lost one boat and several men in a big operation, and they were hit by a lot more than two or three people."  Elliott stressed that he never questioned Kerry's decision to kill the Viet Cong, and he appeared in Boston at Kerry's side during the 1996 Senate race to back up that aspect of Kerry's action.   The next latest one is   Providence Journal-Bulletin  (Rhode Island) October 28, 1996 -- Kerry calls on wartime colleagues to help rebuff columnist's attack  (AP)--relevant passage is:    Kerry's staff arranged a news conference at the Courageous Sailing Center in the Charlestown Navy Yard. It also flew in several people who attested to Kerry's character and his version of events.  They were retired Admiral E.R. Zumwalt Jr., who commanded U.S. naval forces in Vietnam; retired Capt. George Elliott, Kerry's commander at the time of the shooting; retired Cmdr. Adrian Longsdale, who commanded shoreline operations at the time, and Belodeau, an electrician who is currently working in Michigan.   Then there is   Behind the hootch; by DAVID WARSH--The Boston Globe, October 27, 1996  --Relevant Passage is:    In 1969, George Elliott was a 31-year-old lieutenant commander, a career naval officer commanding Coastal Division 11. Today, Elliott, a retired Navy captain, lives in Lewes, Del., where he is president of the local historical society. He is both sharp and friendly.  While saying he had not agreed for many years with Kerry's politics, Elliott remembered him as an outstanding young officer to whom he gave a glowing fitness report.  Of the citation, Elliott said: "I don't remember whether I initiated it or whether it was one of the troops who was with him. The recommendation left over my signature. I was not an eyewitness, but I stand by it.  "The only question I had for him was why did he leave his boat. A commander doesn't leave his boat. I pressed him on that, more for his benefit than for anything else . . . It was another of those things, you either court-martial him or you give him a medal."  "I had no reason to question his motives or his actions."  What if the man Kerry killed was wounded at the time? Elliott was dismissive. "In combat, as much reaction as thoughtful action, lots of guys have been killed by a wounded man. I don't know what weapon he had, or if he had, but you don't have much time to think in those situations."  But were there no eyewitnesses? "That may be my recollection. There was a dead guy there and John had a weapon. That's the way it is sometimes.  "Where the rest of the men were, and what they saw, I can't remember. I took the stories down, what I considered to be corroboration . . . There is no question that someone ran and that a few seconds later there was a dead man behind the hootch."  What about Bellodeau's medal? "There may have been another guy. You try to spread the glory around. It's hard to describe what you try to do with decorations. It's part hype, part leadership. You don't want to cheapen it but you've got to recognize uncommon behavior. You've got to get them to go back out there.  "I had Purple Hearts in foot-cube boxes to give out," recalls Elliott. "You have aluminum boats, there's a lot of shrapnel flying around." But he says he recommended few other Silver Stars - possibly as few as one other. "I had two Bronze Stars myself. People say to me, 'Did you earn 'em?' I say, 'I earned one of them. A Silver Star was hard to come by.' "   Now, I couldn't find any specifics on the 1996 press-conference where Elliott appeared on behalf of Kerry--but  urlLink NRO's Jim Geraghty  notes that the conference was to deny that Kerry had committed a war crime (as was hinted at in the Warsh piece cited above).  So we're left with a few questions:  (1) What'd Elliott say in that 1996 press-conference? (2) Do his statements now contradict his earlier statements? (3) If so, is there an explanation for that apparent contradiction? (this'll probably be in  urlLink the book , if anywhere)  Though  urlLink Hugh Hewitt  thinks the more important issue is Kerry's "Cambodian Christmas".

      Some people doubt John Kerry's commitment to the war effort.  They are wrong, John Kerry is as committed to the war and the security of this country as he has ever been.   urlLink This story  should confirm that.    When asked whether he would have gone to war had Saddam not disarmed:   "You bet we might have"  Can anyone doubt that steely eyed determination? Like a prize fighter needing to summon that last bit of energy to go that last round--John Kerry will undoubtedly, completely, and totally CONSIDER going to war.   Let no one say this man isn't just what he is.

      WWF-- urlLink No gold medal for the environment in the Athens Olympics :  Gland, Switzerland – The Athens 2004 Olympics have lost any chances for a medal on environmental performance, according to the first comprehensive assessment of the costs and benefits of the upcoming games by WWF. It calls on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ensure that future Olympic host cities strictly abide by official environmental rules and regulations.   ***  On a scale of 0–4, it rates the environmental component of the Athens Olympics at a very disappointing score of 0.77. The lowest scores were given to areas such as environmental planning and evaluation, protection of fragile natural and cultural areas, waste management and water conservation, and the use of environmentally-friendly construction technologies. The highest scores went to the fields of public transport, the improvement of existing infrastructure, and the promotion of environmental awareness. WWF is concerned that these wins may disappear when the Olympic Games come to a close.    This could be one of the bigger trainwrecks in Olympic history.  Though whether it will match  urlLink Montreal's $1.5 billion dollar loss  remains to be seen.

      I write long emails--or at least I do when I get into discussions with fellow law school students.  Today one (very liberal fellow) asked:   How do you win the war on terror? Is it simply a war of attrition?     I'm reprinting my response here since well, it makes me look productive:   First though, the war is misnamed.  Terrorism is a tactic.  But because he was being political, Bush called it a war on terror so as not to offend some Muslims.  That being said--you win the war on terror by denying the efficacy of terrorism as a tactic.  Here, Islamic terrorists think terrorism is effective because of their belief that Western states are decadent and weak countries that will cave when attacked.  That they were proven right in Spain only reinforced this notion.  Short version: They hit you, you hit back 5 times as hard. Anything less conveys weakness and encourages more attacks. The only way to defeat terrorism (esp. of the suicide variety) is to deny any incentive or reasonable chance of success from it.  Terrorism is used because they believe it succeeds. Deny them that success and you will find far fewer individuals willing to go splodey-dope for anybody.  With specific regard to Islamic radicalism, some will argue that their adherence to the notion of martyrdom makes combating them even more difficult (if not impossible).  Horsepoop.    Suicide attacks are not new--they were used by Japan in Okinawa--and after the initial shock that the Japanese would do such a thing--the Americans got down to the dirty business of killing the Kamikazes before they could do significant damage.  Eventually it became rather difficult for Japan to find enough "volunteers" for these missions since their military efficacy was so dubious.  Similarly, by making it absolutely, painfully, even bloodily clear that terrorism will NOT work and will be met by an overwhelming response--you deny terrorists the very incentive by which to engage in such attacks--their mistaken belief that it works.  As for Islam, the gloss about dying for Allah is a powerful notion--but it is ultimately just a gloss--a selling point used to get ignorant, illiterate, and downright wretched young men and women to do something no rational person would otherwise do.  But even with the promise of 72 virgins (or raisins depending on your translation), there still needs to be a belief that blowing yourself up for Allah will have some effect ON THE GROUND.  If it doesn't have any effect, then people will find a new tactic.  That's the thumbnail version. My blog is rapidly becoming just a dumping ground for my emails.

      Boston Globe-- urlLink Veteran retracts criticism of Kerry .    But yesterday, a key figure in the anti-Kerry campaign, Kerry's former commanding officer, backed off one of the key contentions. Lieutenant Commander George Elliott said in an interview that he had made a ''terrible mistake" in signing an affidavit that suggests Kerry did not deserve the Silver Star -- one of the main allegations in the book. The affidavit was given to The Boston Globe by the anti-Kerry group to justify assertions in their ad and book.  ***  Yesterday, reached at his home, Elliott said he regretted signing the affidavit and said he still thinks Kerry deserved the Silver Star.  ''I still don't think he shot the guy in the back," Elliott said. ''It was a terrible mistake probably for me to sign the affidavit with those words. I'm the one in trouble here."  Elliott said he was no under personal or political pressure to sign the statement, but he did feel ''time pressure" from those involved in the book. ''That's no excuse," Elliott said. ''I knew it was wrong . . . In a hurry I signed it and faxed it back. That was a mistake."  That isn't the end of the story since Elliott later in the article says:     Elliott, in the interview yesterday, said that based on the affidavits of the veterans on other boats, he now thinks his [positive] assessment about the Bronze Star and third Purple Heart may have been based on poor information.  ***  But he said: ''I simply have no reason for these guys to be lying, and if they are lying in concert, it is one hell of a conspiracy. So, on the basis of all of the information that has come out, I have chosen to believe the other men. I absolutely do not know first hand."  Couple thoughts:  the retraction of the Silver Star charge is obviously not helpful to the Swiftees--but while Elliott may reconsider his opinion--as yet none of the others have.  And that is, to a large extent, what this debate is--a difference of opinion re: the "quality" of Kerry's record.  In Elliott's mind, Kerry's conduct warranted a Silver Star--in the Swiftees' view, it did not.   Now, combine that with the fact that Elliott still harbors doubts about Kerry's Bronze Star and third Purple Heart and it's not clear that this will seriously undercut the Swiftees.  But as I said, it certainly doesn't HELP.  But of course, a lot of this is dependent upon what the book says--if the book has additional evidence regarding the Silver Star; then that could mitigate.  If not, it won't.     UPDATE :  Via  urlLink Drudge  comes this press release from the Swiftees  urlLink saying Elliott stands by his earlier claims :   The following statement from Swift Boat Veterans for Truth is in response to an article appearing in the morning edition of the Boston Globe (“Veteran Retracts Criticism of Kerry”) which implies that one Vietnam Veteran wishes to retract an affidavit he signed regarding John Kerry’s actions during and after Kerry’s time in Vietnam. The signed affidavit can be seen below.   "Captain George Elliott describes an article appearing in today’s edition of the Boston Globe by Mike Kranish as extremely inaccurate and highly misstating his actual views. He reaffirms his statement in the current advertisement paid for by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, Captain Elliott reaffirms his affidavit [see below] in support of that advertisement, and he reaffirms his request that the ad be played.   Doesn't look like this is over yet.   UPDATE 2 :   urlLink Human Events Online  has a second affidavit, dated today and signed by George Elliott, it reads:   "Had I known the facts, I would not have recommended Kerry for the Silver Star for simply pursuing and dispatching a single, wounded, fleeing Viet Cong"  Well, ok then.

      It's  urlLink The Political Machine  and there's a first review  urlLink here :    The Political Machine is a strategy game in which players take on the role of a campaign manager for a United States Presidential candidate. You must utilize all of your political know-how in order to manage a successful forty-one week campaign while dodging obstacles throughout the campaign trail. After weeks and weeks on the campaign trail, the game comes down to one final moment: the counting of the electoral votes. For those political buffs out there, it’s 270 electoral votes on election night to win.  ***  The Political Machine also plays to the cynical side of most political junkies. Like any true Presidential Campaign, media attention plays an integral role in the campaign process. The Political Machine addresses this aspect by creating fictitious news shows that your candidate can appear on such as the Barry King Live and 60 Seconds. You only have one minute to answer each question posed to you. In turn, your answers will directly affect your voter awareness in key states.   Hehe...awesome--I am so getting this.

I for one, never could quite get into Keyes--I did see him thoroughly trounce Alan Dershowitz in a debate on C-SPAN some years ago--but that was it.  His TV show was just bad, and the fact that he's running in IL after having made such a stink about Hillary carpepbagging in NY doesn't speak well of the man.

As for the piece itself, it's Krugman, so it's rambling, rhetorically deficient, and prone to make one's eyballs bleed.  Oh, it's about Iraq in some way or another.  He ends with this:    Should we cut and run? No. But we should get realistic, and look in earnest for an exit.

       urlLink McGehee at blogoSFERICS  thinks the Swift Vets ad and subsequent debate is to Kerry's advantage:    I think that attacking...Kerry there only plays into his hands. He wants the focus of the campaign to be on something that happened over 30 years ago, before he came back to the States, discovered his service wasn’t a political plus after all, and joined the anti-war movement. He wants the focus of the campaign to be kept away from his Senate record.    If it were Cheney making these charges or other high-profile people in the Bush campaign doing it--I'd agree.  Since then the Kerry camp could highlight Cheney's lack of service and Bush's lack of overseas service.  But it's not either of them doing it--it's fellow veterans.  And since Kerry has made veterans' apparent support for him THE cornerstone of his campaign, I don't see how it plays into his hands to note that lots of veterans are mightily pissed at him.  Nor do I think this substantially detracts from the attention that can be given his Senate record--primarily because it's NOT the campaign making these charges.  The Swiftees/Swifties/Swifters(?) can have their own private war with Kerry over this issue--while the campaign can go full on out against his Senate record.  And when you combine his anti-defense votes with separate charges that he maligned and slandered fellow soldiers--that he is "reporting for duty" looks less and less credible.

      One wonders McCain's relevance to this story is beyond thinking Kerry is a nice guy.  THAT much isn't in dispute.  However, the "quality" (best word I can think of) of Kerry's service in Vietnam is at issue, and McCain was not present at that point in time.    He may well  urlLink not like the ad , so what though?  And  urlLink much is being made  of this  urlLink American History   piece by Doug Brinkley describing the Bronze Star mission in question.  However, there's a problem:  The reports that the boats came under fire were made BY Kerry--whose veracity on this issue is what's in question.   "John Kerry is lying!" "Here is an article that says otherwise." "That's an article written by John Kerry, quoting John Kerry, from the  John Kerry Center for All Things John Kerry ."

      Not to take his bounceless convention lightly, Kerry has decided to throw some serious read meat to the crazies  urlLink by pulling a Michael Moore :   “Had I been reading to children and had my top aide whisper in my ear that America is under attack, I would have told those kids very nicely and politely that the president of the United States has something that he needs to attend to,” Kerry said.   I was recently in a VERY long email discussion with some folks from my law school on this topic (their well-reasoned dicourse contended that Bush was "a pussy" and should have stood out in the open in DC following learning of the attacks)--I'm going to reprint my response in that email--which effectively rebuts the Kerry charge as well (much of this is taken from the 9/11 Report pp 24-30):     AA 11 hit the first tower at 8:43:40 am.  The second plane (UA 175) hit at 9:03:11.  Moore accuses Bush of inaction in the seven minutes following being told by Andy Card that a second plane had struck the WTC and that we were under attack.    The implication by Moore is that Bush could have done something in those seven minutes to prevent either AA 77 or UA 93 from crashing into the Pentagon and Pennsylvania field, respectively.  What that is, Moore obviously doesn't say, since that would require coherence.  Though it should be noted that Lee Hamilton (D), vice chair of the 9/11 Comm'n said that in his opinion: "Bush made the right decision in remaining calm, in not rushing out of the classroom."  With specific regards to AA 77, I refer to pp 24-27 of the Comm'n report (from which I will paraphrase greatly) and if you can find me anything within between 9:03 and 9:10 that could have been done with regards to AA 77 or UA 93, I'm all ears.    It should be noted that it was not until approximately 9:25 that the FAA headquarters deduced that AA 77 was lost and likely hijacked.  At 9:25, the FAA ordered a "nationwide ground stop".  However, AA 77 was still incommunicado and off radar during this time.  It was at 9:32 that Dulles controllers were able to "[observe] a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed"--though the aircraft's identity or type was unknown.  Reagan National had an unarmed Nat'l Guard C-130H, just having taken off, to ID and follow the craft.  At 9:38, AA 77 crashed into the Pentagon.  On the military side; NEADS (North Eastern Air Defense Sector) heard nothing re: AA 77--their initial report at 9:21 from the FAA centered on AA 11--which had already crashed by that point.  However, the communication between the two mentioned a "third aircraft" that NEADS thought was AA 11.  At 9:24, the order to scramble fighters from Langley, VA was processed. By 9:30, they were airborne.  The fighters were positioned between New York and Wash DC to attempt to intercept AA 11 (which was mistakenly believed to still be airborne and headed towards DC)  The military first learned on AA 77 at 9:34 via a chance comment by the FAA's Washington Center. To quote the comm'n: "No one at FAA headquarters ever asked for military assistance with American 77."  At 9:36, FAA Boston called NEADS to tell them about the unidentified aircraft closing in on Washington.  The fighters, due to a myriad of doctrinal and logistical reasons, had not been heading north, but east. When AA 77 hit the Pentagon at 9:37:46, the Langley fighters were 150 miles away.  With respect to UA 93, contact with that craft was severed at 9:27.  By 9:34, word of the hijacking reached FAA HQ.  At 9:36, FAA Cleveland contacted the Command Center at Herndon and notified them of the situation, including asking whether to ask to request the military launch fighter aircraft to intercept.  CC at Herndon said that FAA personnel above them had to make that decision and were working on it.  At 9:42, Herndon learned that AA 77 had struck the Pentagon.  It was not until 9:53 that FAA HQ informed Herndon that the deputy director for air traffic svcs was inquiring about scrambling aircraft.  UA 93 crashed at 10:03:11  On the military side, NEADS didn't rec'v a communication about UA 93 until 10:07--four minutes after the crash; then unbeknownst to NEADS.    Again, if you can point to ANYTHING Bush could have done during those 7 minutes, please let me know.  If your argument amounts to nothing more than he should have done SOMETHING--please sit down and let the serious people talk. That's what I said then (7/30), and I'm sayin' it again now.

      Via  urlLink Glenn  comes this letter sent to radio stations and broadcast stations by lawyers for the DNC threatening to sue those stations if they run " urlLink the ad ".    The letter reads in part:    The advertisement contains statements by men who purport to have served on Senator Kerry's SWIFT Boat in Vietnam...In fact, not a single one of the men who pretend to have served with Senator Kerry was actually a crewmate of Senator Kerry's...  There's just one small problem with that charge--the ad never claims the people on it were Kerry's CREWMATES.  They served with John Kerry--by being in the same Swift boat group--not by being on Kerry's particular boat(s).  The ad never claims otherwise.   So basically the letter alleges something that is not claimed--good job.

      Well, the  urlLink Swift Vets ad  is all the rage right now.  And now  urlLink John McCain is condemning the ads  --but more importantly, asking that Bush follow suit.    The White House and Bush-Cheney campaign did not address McCain's call that they repudiate the spot, though a Bush spokesman said the campaign does not question Kerry's highly decorated war service. McCain is co-chair of Bush's campaign in Arizona.    McCain also complained:   "It was the same kind of deal that was pulled on me," McCain said in an interview with The Associated Press, referring to his bitter Republican primary fight with President Bush.    But then one reads:   The ad, scheduled to air in a few markets in Ohio, West Virginia and Wisconsin, was produced by Stevens, Reed, Curcio and Potham,  the same team that produced McCain's ads in 2000 .   Maybe John meant it was the same kind of stuff pulled on BEHALF of him? Kidding. (emphasis mine)  But seriously, should Bush disavow this ad and the men who made it?  Or does he risk pulling a Wes Clark when Clark didn't repudiate Michael Moore who alleged Bush was AWOL and Clark then saw his poll numbers drop like a stone?    I think the campaign has it right--they will not themselves make an issue of his service (out of sight, out of mind) and will assume it was honorable.  But if any people closer to the action want to speak up--that is their right.  Now, why is this ad so much more damaging than those goofy MoveOn.org ads that compare Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld/Wolfowitz to Hitler ("We are all Hitler Now"?)  This ad is so much more harmful because (A) it intros with Edwards essentially challenging people to ask those who served with John Kerry if you want to know about the man.  Well they did. And that's (B), all decorated individuals (and a LOT of em--14 separate people by my count) and (C) they don't pussyfoot around--they flat out call him a liar.  That's heavy stuff.    The MoveOn ads, on the other hand, just used a red filter and super-imposed a picture of Hitler over Bush.  Fun imagery, bad political ad.  Had they shown people saying "Bush ordered me into the gas chamber himself!"--better ad.  But back to the point--should Bush repudiate? No.  Kerry has made his Vietnam service the cornerstone of why he should be Commander in Chief.  Had it been but ONE aspect of his record that he played up, then the ad might be going too far.  But no, Kerry has avoided his Senate record and you'd have a hard time knowing he was even IN the Senate if you watched the DNC.    Their campaign strategy was that Kerry=Vietnam; and they assumed that Vietnam was inviolate.  They were wrong. Bush shouldn't applaud the ad--nor should he repudiate it though.

       urlLink Rusty   at MyPetJawa has some thoughts on "Wars of Necessity" stemming from this post by  urlLink Matt Yglesias .  Yglesias thinks that both the Revolution and WWII were "wars of necessity" rather than "wars of choice."  Rusty writes:    What, exactly, is meant by 'War of Necessity' anyway? For example, can anyone really argue that the actions taken by the Jefferson administration against the North African city-states were 'necessary' for the survival of the country? Was that not a 'war-of-choice' and not of 'necessity?    I think even Yglesias is stretching a bit with his inclusion of WWII as a war of necessity.  After all, the criterion chosen seems to be that a war of necessity is such only where it's a response to a direct attack.  But even then, the state is still CHOOSING to respond.  That it was attacked might make the state's choice more morally justified--but it still was a choice.  Using the two examples Yglesias provides--WWII and the Revolution:  the US could have easily let Imperial Japan control the Pacific and have been content to cede dominance of that ocean to her.  On the European front--the US again could have let Germany run roughshod over Europe without much of a threat to US security.  Now, this would have been a morally indefensible decision--but it was still a decision that the US was able to make.    Indeed, the American Revolutionaries could simply have chosen to stay British subjects.  That breaking off from Britain was a GOOD decision doesn't negate the fact it was still a choice they made.  For my money, no war is a war of necessity.  They are ALL wars of choice--but that fact alone doesn't invalidate that such a choice was made.

      (via  urlLink Allah ) Think  urlLink THIS  might come back to bite Teresa in the ass?  From the Newsmax article:    Just six months after the Sept. 11 attacks, Teresa Heinz Kerry urged Americans to try to "understand the roots of international terror," while contending that the Sept. 11 attacks were best viewed as an "isolated catastrophe."   Via NEXIS, the op-ed is titled:  KIDS STILL NEED HELP WITH SEPT. 11 and deals with how to help kids understand the attacks.  The relevant passage is:    We pray that one day we will view Sept. 11 as an isolated catastrophe, triggering a successful world campaign to try to understand the roots of international terror as well as to work cooperatively to remove it.   I'll let  urlLink John Kerry  say it for us all:    “Wasn't Teresa great? She speaks her mind. And she speaks the truth.”  Oh this'll be fun.

      From the NYT comes  urlLink this story  of a writing workshop taking place at Camp Lejune intended to teach Marines to be better writers so as to preserve their battlefield stories.    The program, called "Operation Homecoming: Writing the Wartime Experience," is aimed at preserving stories from the battlegrounds of Iraq and Afghanistan. The endowment expects to hold 20 or so workshops at American military installations between now and next spring (Camp Lejeune was the second stop; the first was Fort Drum in upstate New York in June), with a formidable roster of participating writers selected by an independent panel of editors appointed by the endowment. It includes military thriller heavyweights like Jeff Shaara and Tom Clancy, as well as prominent literary lights like Tobias Wolff and Richard Bausch.   The program, which will cost about $500,000, is being paid for almost entirely by the Boeing Company. And the Defense Department (an unlikely-seeming bedfellow for the endowment, which is also providing $1 million for a program that will take productions of Shakespeare to military bases) is providing logistical service.   I think this is a wonderful idea.  Some of the best wartime reading is from those who were there (but that can actually write well).  That fact might explain this:    Many of the fledgling writers encountered here are despairing and angry, they said, that their stories are being told, inadequately and inaccurately, only by the news media and civilian authors.    Needless to say, this is cool.  UPDATE: Submitted to the  urlLink Beltway Traffic Jam

      NYT-- urlLink New Qaeda Activity Is Said to Be Major Factor in Alert .    Senior government officials said Tuesday that new intelligence pointing to a current threat of a terrorist attack on financial targets in New York and possibly in Washington - not just information about surveillance on specific buildings over the years - was a major factor in the decision over the weekend to raise the terrorism alert level.   The officials said the separate stream of intelligence, which they had not previously disclosed, reached the White House only late last week and was part of a flow that the officials said had prompted them to act urgently in the last few days.  The officials disclosed the information a day after the Bush administration acknowledged for the first time that much of the surveillance activity cited last weekend by Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge to justify the latest, specific warnings had been at least three years old. At the same time, the White House offered a vigorous defense of its decision to heighten the alert in Manhattan, Newark and Washington, with officials saying there was still good reason for alarm.  But lest the Administration escape the "damned if you do, damned if you don't" mentality of the press, we get this:   Among other things, one official disclosed on Tuesday that one intelligence report had pointed to a possible attack "in August or September.''  That shifting tone may prove frustrating to the public, providing little guidance for assessing the gravity of threat information whose details remain shrouded in intelligence reports not available to anyone outside the highest ranks of the government.  I suggest that Homeland Security just change its  urlLink homepage  to say nothing but "Shit B Comin', Yo."  Doubts about specificity? Hey, they told you Shit B Comin',  doubts about the veracity of the alert? Hey, it wasn't just Shit B Comin', it was Shit B Comin', YO.  It's a win-win.

       urlLink Missouri  has passed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.   With nearly all precincts reporting, the amendment had garnered 71 percent of the vote, according to unofficial results for Tuesday's vote.  That's a fairly sizeable number, yes?  But here's what struck me--in listening to the debate on this particular amendment--one opponent was quoted as saying that such an amendment was unnecessary, and besides, it was bigoted.  The argument, I suppose, was that MO law offered sufficient protection for traditional marriage such that an amendment was "unnecessary."  Proponents obviously argue that lest judges be allowed to circumvent the law, such an amendment is required.  Now, that's a fair argument on both sides where reasonable folks can disagree.  The problem was in the second part--that not only was the amendment unnecessary, it was also bigoted.  Hold up now.  Assuming the current MO law is sufficient to prevent same-sex marriage from being recognized such that the amendment is redundant, doesn't saying the amendment is bigoted ALSO impute the same bigotry onto the CURRENT law?  It would seem so.  And if the current law IS so bigoted--how could it survive a court challenge?

      Drudge has  urlLink unloaded the big font  to cite to the  urlLink NYT's reporting  that much of the info that led to the increased terror level was old (circa 2001).  Here's the  urlLink WaPo story  on it.  Naturally, this will lead the fever-swamp to think that Dean's claims that the threat was raised for political reasons is valid--(it'll be interesting to see how Kerry responds after having repudiated Dean's remarks)--but while WaPo is running passionate sounding bits like this:   "There is nothing right now that we're hearing that is new," said one senior law enforcement official who was briefed on the alert. "Why did we go to this level? . . . I still don't know that."    This is hardly a revelation as  urlLink FOX's Catherine Herridge  reported on Special Report this afternoon that the building specific information was from that earlier time period:   An official said Al Qaeda's gathering of the building information took place both before and after Sept. 11, 2001.  An anonymous senior intelligence official said the intelligence indicated Al Qaeda had evaluated security in and around the five buildings, the best places for reconnaissance, how to make contact with employees who work in the buildings, traffic patterns and locations of hospitals and police departments.  The official said the Al Qaeda evaluations were so precise they included midweek pedestrian traffic counts of 14 people per minute on each side of the street for a total of 28 people. The official said he had not seen such extraordinary detail in his 24 years in intelligence work.  Now, the unnamed intelligence official in the  Post  story might not think much of this, though you'd have to get to page 2 of the Post's story to find a source that did:   Other officials also stressed that, however long ago al Qaeda operatives compiled the surveillance details, the information was new to U.S. intelligence agencies and was almost unprecedented in the depth of its details. "All this stuff was fresh to us," one official said.   ***  "It's not known whether the plot was active and ongoing," the official added. "It could have been planned for tomorrow, or it could have been scrapped. Maybe there were other iterations of it. In this environment, this was seen as pertinent information to get out to the public. There was discussion over the weekend, should we wait until Monday?"   Initially, top administration officials had decided to wait until yesterday to announce the alert, but more intelligence information was coming in -- both new translations of the documents, and analysis of other sources' statements -- that deepened their concern about the information, and persuaded them to move ahead swiftly. "There was a serious sense of urgency to get it out," the senior intelligence official said.    Further, doesn't that fact that this information was found recently on the computer of an recently arrested Al Qaeda operative detract from the implication that the intelligence was "old"?  From the  NYT  (buried again):   The documents were found after Pakistani authorities acting on information supplied by the Central Intelligence Agency arrested Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan, an engineer who was found to have served as a middleman in facilitating Qaeda communications. His capture led the C.I.A. to laptop computers, CD-ROM's, and other storage devices that contained copies of communications describing the extensive surveillance.  Mr. Khan had been essentially unknown to the United States as recently as May, according to information provided by a Pakistani intelligence official, who said the C.I.A. had described him to Pakistani authorities that month only as a shadowy figure identified by his alias, Abu Talha.   The lack of knowledge about Mr. Khan reflected how hard it has been for American authorities to penetrate Al Qaeda. He operated successfully without the government learning of his existence even after three years of an intensive intelligence war against Qaeda that has emphasized efforts to intercept the terror network's communications traffic.    So we've got a heretofore unknown al Qaeda operative traveling with potentially dangerous intelligence regarding specific targets in the US--does it really matter that the details ABOUT the buildings were from around 2001?    After all, the building are still there, and hence, still targets.  If the info were for the WTC, I'd say yeah, no need to increase the terror threat.  But that isn't the case here.    I eagerly await Kerry's response--though  urlLink Democratic Underground  is already claiming "wag the dog".  UPDATE:  urlLink Michelle Malkin  has more.

      With charges that the recent terror threat warning was  urlLink motivated more by politics  than by a real threat--it has become clear that this White House will do anything for political gain.  Including:   Running for the Presidency.   There, I said it.  And I am sticking to it--clearly the President's decision to seek a second term in office is nothing more than a political ploy designed to take away coverage from the Kerry/Edwards campaign.  And how shameless a ploy it is.  John Kerry gives a speech? George Bush gves a speech--the corporate media, in lockstep with Big Oil&trade;, must cover both speeches which necessarily results in less time given to Kerry.  Thomas Jefferson would indeed be ashamed to see his beloved republic subjected to such rank political opportunism as has been shown by President Bush in his crass insistence that he be reelected.  It is truly a dark day for democracy when a President can use the bully pulpit to suggest that he is more deserving of the job than his challenger.  My God, what would the Founding Fathers say?  It is clear then, that Bush and his cronies are engaging in this sham of a campaign for no other reason than to halt the unstoppable force that is the Kerry/Edwards juggernaut.    It is a shameless and reprehensible ploy and all Republicans should be ashamed at playing politics with the American political system.

       urlLink Stryker , comments on the John Kerry/Marines story:   So, if Kerry were to become the next Commander-in-Chief, would you still be against him 100%? Or would it come down to 60 or 75%? I’m trying to figure this out, because support for the current CINC is one thing, but when you openly express that you’re 100% against the guy who could be your next CINC, then you’re setting yourself up for a situation you don’t want to be in. We serve the Position, not the Man. The military has no business forming personality cults around politicians.   Stryker then links and quotes  urlLink this post  by Hugh Hewitt where Hugh writes:   This is how the overwhelming number active duty military in this country feel about the Democratic Party and its Michael Moore-loving elites. Clip and save and reread when you hear Kerry-Edwards talking about how they will strengthen the military. The would-be commander-in-chief doesn’t have the respect of the men and women he seeks to command. George W. Bush does. So whose judgment do you trust when it comes to which man is better equipped to lead the military and guide the war? The active duty soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, or John Kerry’s band of brothers?    Stryker's response?   Go to hell. *** Let me clue you in on something, Hugh: We’re not fucking idiots. You will find as many opinions on Bush, Kerry and all the rest of it as you’ll find in the rest of the country. There’s about as many Democrats as Republicans in the military, especially among enlisted folk. There’s an even greater percentage of people who don’t care at all because they know that it doesn’t matter who’s President or who’s in control of Congress. Our lives don’t change.  Needless to say, it's an interesting exchange thus far. My own worthless two cents: I think Stryker's argument that because their own lives will change little regardless of who is President is a different point that what Hugh is arguing.  Essentially, Stryker's argument is that the number of deployments remained essentially the same during Bush I and Clinton and that both Administrations didn't do everything they could have for the military.  While undoubtedly true, it's also fairly incomplete as analyses go.  To draw an analogy, will MY life be drastically different if either Bush or Kerry is elected (given my expected income, education, etc?)--probably not.  Very few of the programs proposed by either really effect my wife and I.  That doesn't mean I, and my circle of peers still don't by and large support Bush over Kerry.  Primarily this is because I think Bush would do far less to impede on my life and my affairs than would Kerry, and Bush's approach would suit the way I wish to run my affairs better than would Kerry's.  I think the same reasonaing applies to the military.  Will they still be deployed? Yup.  Will certain systems get canned and other approved? Yup.  Will certain social-science programs get approved to tinker with the military? Yup.  But that's not the end of the analysis.  That military votes tend to skew Republican is a fact, and one which does have an explanation.    For Stryker, it might NOT make a difference who sits in the Big Chair in terms of where he's sent. But if that's the only criterion by which he gauges whom to vote for, again, that's not the whole story.  As I said, my own worthless two cents. Wonder how Hugh will respond.

       urlLink Wizbang  found a really weird piece of graffiti relating to the GOP convention.    But this raises a more interesting question: given that the media didn't spend all that much time covering the protestors during the DNC--will they do the same for the GOP protestors?  First, I think the limited coverage was a function of the strict security imposed by Boston and the fact that the protestors never really got out of hand. I do think though, that both the protestors and the media will be far more "active" come NYC.  The goofiness of the protestors converging on New York is well  urlLink documented .    Now, some would argue that if the protestors get out of hand or if the media focus a lot of attention on them--it will bad for Bush and the Republicans. I disagree completely.  For one, these are not reasonable people making coherent arguments over which reasonable people can disagree.  Nope, they're black hooded dickheads breaking windows because "wealth is murder" or some such nonsense.  Further, they're not exactly the loyal opposition either when they ask for US soldiers to frag their officers.  I think the more such nonsense is covered, the more it invariably HELPS Bush.  Since the natural reaction is to associate those that are protesting the GOP (and hence, Bush) with the leading opposition group--the Democrats.    Might this be an unfair association? Sometimes--I don't think the Democrats support most of the silliness that will show up in NYC.  But the majority of these protestors WILL be virulently anti-war and anti-military.  And for all the pomp and circumstance and attempts to wrap themselves in the national security blanket, the Democrats are STILL led by John Kerry, with a long record of being against funding the military as well as his ever-changing position on the war.   Ultimately, the DNC's attempts to recast themselves as tough on terrorism will fall flat--and, unfairly or not, the anti-war and disgustingly anti-Bush protestors will be associated with the Democrats to some extent.  So I'm all for the media covering the protestors--give them interview time--tell me MORE about why you think Bush is Hitler. I want to hear it all.
