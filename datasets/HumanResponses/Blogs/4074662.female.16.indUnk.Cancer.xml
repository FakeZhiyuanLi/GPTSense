         In about an hour I'm leaving for a b-ball tourney in Verona with my school basketball team! It will hopefully be a lot of fun... there are some really cool people I'm gonna get a chance to hang out w/ all weekend... Jackie and Becky and Repech and Jenna and Joc and Rachel and Stace..... I just hope I don't get sick of em! lol. We played really well yesterday (Thursday)... we lost by 1... we were down 29-26 with 30 seconds left and I hit a 3 :), but then with about 1.2 seconds left, I made a mistake to counteract my awesome 3 by fouling the girl that shot... she made her 2nd free throw, and wa la, they won. It sucked, and I am STILL really mad at myself... my friends did remind me tho that if I wouldn't have made the 3 we never even would have been in the game - so I guess I forgive myself  a little bit.  I really hope we can win at least 3 out of our 5 games this weekend - it would be so nice... I'm so tired of losing it's not even funny. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one that wants to be out there on that court....... I don't know if that's always true, but it sure is what it feels like. I think if we start winning though, people will want to be out practicing b-ball and playing it with more passion, because it will be more fun if we win! Ahh well... gotta go finish packing... wish me luck... cuz I think we'll probably need it - we're up against some really good teams! Hope it's fun....          Adios....          - Hopeful            Go Comets

       Just sittin around right now bored as heck... and tired! I got up today and lifted at 7 am, and of course, I had to lift by myself  again.  It really pisses me off that no girls ever lift anymore - or when they say they will,  it usually just ends up with them talking to all the guys in the weight room & flirtin w/ em (which yes, I do too, but I find time to lift - what a weight room's for - too!) I wish I could get all the girls on my b-ball team to come lift with me - I seriously think it would help us win at least 3 or 4 more games, because we'll be stronger than most of the other teams! But I guess I should forget about that, because it's never gonna happen! I'll just continue to get better & stronger-- it's not my problem when I play over someone because I am stronger. I feel like I'm bragging when I say that, but truthfully I'm not, because I work so much harder than most of my friends that I think I  deserve  a spot over them. If they worked hard too, I'd have a little more respect for them. The only person I really have respect for is Kelly and maybe Jackie. Other than that, I think most of the girls are out there just for exercise. Just as long as we win like double or more games as we did last year I'll be happy. And it's definitely a possibilty - Fellin is going to push us HARD. I can't wait.   On more of a pleasant thought, lol, this past weekend was awesome. We all stayed in one hotel, and while we didn't win a single game (out of the 5 we played), they were all within about 5, and we definitely all came together as a team - we got closer w/ each other. Rep, Stace, Becks, and I had so much fun prank calling the other room, and we were even gonna TP their room, but then they discovered we had their key! (that sucked! :( ) We ate awesome food - went to Cheeseburger in Paradise! I LOVE Jimmy Buffett, and so does Rep. I thought she was gonna hyperventilate when she saw that there was one where we were shopping. lol. It was so great. The atmosphere was unbelievable, and the food was beyond delicious!!!!!!    It's nice to be home now, in my own bed, with TWO pillows (lol) and a big bathroom with a sink inside instead of having to walk out to wash your hands! (that got very annoying!)    Hope Tiff's ankle is okay... she injured it on Sunday - she was yelling and shrieking in pain - like she almost hyperventilated (for real!) I have no doubt that it hurt a lot... she is a major drama queen though, so my guess is she'll be back to playing within a week.    I'm off to acceleration - it's a great workout program - it's gotten me a lot faster! I have only 2 more sessions left!! I can't wait to do it again next summer!!!!   Hope this week goes well. :)   HAPPY SWEET 16  RACH & BRIANNA!!! (on Wednesday!) Luv ya both!!!      -- B-ball chica
