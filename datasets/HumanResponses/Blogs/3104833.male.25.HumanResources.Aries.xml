Good people and a promsing company !

      Sorry, long time no blog. (As if this blog actually has readers !) BTW.: If you read this send drop me a line: cistern64(a)hotmail.com..  Another week is well (?) started at Girvan. Last week was exceptionally unproductive. I have been using a lot of time thinking through wheter I should try to get a job in Silicon Valley or not.  Still haven't decided, depends on terms and which company I can get a position with. Maybe someone want a office in Norway? Oh by the way I got accepted to the coaching and mentoring classes in Norway, now I have to prioritize..  Back to Company X Businessplan now !

       urlLink Google (LABS)   Googled the innovative campaign by Google where they put a sign up on 101 to attract top-notch engineers. The sign said "www.{first-10-digit-prime-in-e}.com" if you figure out the number, it will take you to a second problem involving pattern recognition in the decimals of e which allows you to login to linux.com and be redirected here..  Great advertising. Ave to Google's HR function !  I trying writing a programm and calculating but found it easier to google for the answer ;)

      Nice picture of alter ego, frille. It is nice to be able to blame frille, like "no I didn't pour a bottle of redwine in the cactus-bowl" or "what girl?"

      LOL, you know those email you get from Prince Abu from Sengal that has one quadzillion he needs to let loose from the evil reign he is the master of. Just need you account detail, SSN, grandpa's pet name and a small "liberation-fee" and he'll gladly give you 50 % of the money.  Those scams are called 419's (Nigeria-letters) and here is a bunch of scam-scammers who really take their pride in giving the scammers a run for their money, hillarious read about a serios matter:  urlLink Welcome to the 419 Eater   WARNING: Do not get fooled by these scammers, under no circumstace meet with them. A norwegian actually did, when he realized he was fooled he went down there to get his money back and never returned.. These operations are know to be managed by the mafia and generally they are not nice people.

      Google is going IPO soon, read the prospect here, should convince the sceptics that there is few hidden agendas and fewer conspiracy theories associated with the Google Toolbar. They use a very interesting offering method, Dutch Auction, that is designed to enable the "little men" to join in on the fun.. Seems to be only for US citizens though :(  In the prospect Google are pointing out what I think of as their biggest strength, their corporate culture, as one of their strengths. As you may know I strongly believe that the human resources in every company will be the unfair advantages of the future.  As a matter of fact I am currently in the process of writing a job-application to Google :)   urlLink Google IPO Prospectus  (Long read..)

       urlLink CNN.com - Business blogging moving mainstream - Jul 29, 2004 : "Informal and personal, blogs also pack a lot of marketing potential, analysts said."  Aiaiai good article, bad news. I am thinking about thousands of computer generated blogs cleverly designed for a marketing purpose for companies worldwide. How can you find a interesting read amidst all that junk? Would this take blogs the way email is going?  Harvesting blogs for information is big business now, how about when people are paid to blog (which I believe will come). Professional bloggers supply professional market researchers with blogpost. An entire new industry blooming..   Gives, "a penny for your thought" and "just my 2 cents" new meanings :)
