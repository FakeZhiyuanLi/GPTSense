       Eversince the past few months, ive been so caught up with lookin into how my dad’s business works, with its functions that I felt like I have the confidence in me to truly want to work my best and take over my dad’s company. I also learned that the main thing bout having ur own company and handlin the business within, is the cash flow. Getting projects is difficult- just like tryin to search for other kinda help from the people whom u know that got cyur back while ur struggling in ur own life,- lonely. Ur Company prices should not be shown or shared cuz that’ll be bursting the bubble. If ur in the sales department, dealin with the clients is what u could practice to be good at. Having a genuine and honest heart is the key to having a good partnership with ur clients, then chillin out with them at night and talking business, digging more into getting further information, then sharing helps from each other. Its like a cycle whereby there starts the hard work,- complex transactions,- standard struggles and pressures, then $$-bingo! U got to remember to have khidmat from god fro urself and family, and have ilmu for ur child(ren).

      Some people may have an inner reality demeanor that stays hidden inside n hardly coming out to the truth. We people can’t all be the same, re-act the same, and live the same. . . but we can be their ‘mentor’ or role model if ud like, by patiently bringing them on to the right path, show them the better prospects in this present life and in this life ahead, from the shares of thoughts and experiences one of us people have gone through. why is there bad and good in this world and in all our lifes? I may be naïve at this stage to think and say it all out like this, but what I’m slowly believing in is that if I wanna help and care for people, either if they are strangers or my people, I would wanna keep on showing them the truth and I guess, . . if u wanna be a helper to complex and difficult quandaries, u got to have to go through them, even if it kills to feel and get through it, . . . but I still got to remember to thank god for the happenings and . .

       though i aint so close to my mum, i appreaciate her being a cool n supportive mum,who yeah-nags n gets all fumed up --but only at times,a mum who cares a lot for her children and her husband-a mum who tries her best to put an effective encouragement for her family and everyone else.. ..*sigh*..i feel so guilty for not showing how much i truly respect all the help, support and risks that she has taken for me-my mum who still backs me up all the way,especially for the promises that i try to fulfill.whenever i hear any 'mama's' song,like for instance,boyz2men's mama and spice girls's mama,i turned away a little cuz i...my mind just reflected back on the way that i nvr respond to her conversations,but just respond in a "yeah-uhuh-uhuh" kinda way,which is honestly not a nice thing to do,cuz there she is,tryin to start sthn new,but me,still livin in the past and being selfish-.this happens the same thing at times with the way i reacted to my sister.not that i dont wanna get with my sister,but i'm still tryin to feel and be myself like i am with the others>;!be a good and responsible sister and daughter.honestly,i'm tryin to cuz i honestly want to..and i gta do it dengan  ihklas .

        tryin to get with someone whom ud want to believe from my point of view,that E(not a real name),has some better values inside,that i feel i could try to get along with which i see that i have not reached yet,cuz i still feel like im on the same old base with E.and i still didnt wanna fail to keep on trying to avoid keeping the aura akward but standard instead.But i guess this is what u have to feel and face in return for some other ppl in your life who tries hard to keep up and do the same thing/way for/to me bcuz of love.  
   ..on the side that is confusing and difficult is that u positively wanna stay strong to follow with how u look at the person,but at times whenever im about to do what im about to do,some unplesant words appeared on the other side of my mind from other ppl's talking.i honestly felt sorry for E,and E knows that this kinda thing usually happens especially if ppl nvr wanna get to know E properly and especially if they tend to misunderstand bout E.But im just...urgh-i mean even when this things happen,E just keep it cool on the outside,which makes me think that she's doin it in a too proud in an whatever im not caring bout what they say cuz i know who i am and im just gonna continue being who i am ...that kinda demeanour.i believe that no one is perfect,and i cant assume that my way of judging ppl is the right one,but i just wanna help and i wanna care cuz i care,-even when i nvr realize that i do,but i thank god for allowing me to have this kinda sense for ppl.now...whenever i see E,im tryin not to look down,but think of a better way to ..make it seem alright.and the things that im talking about here is..about a friend of mine..a girl.
