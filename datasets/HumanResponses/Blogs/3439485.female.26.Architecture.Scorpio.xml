      which is today, I thought I'd share a page from our past.  Karen and I met at Clemson during a research summer through the Governor's School of Math and Science after our junior year in high school.  She actually wanted to be a scientist.  I, on the other hand, was smarting after being unfairly waitlisted by the drama department at the Governor's School of the Arts, which was only a summer program at that time.  But  that's a story for another blogpost. At any rate, she was mercilessly torturing and killing bugs in the name of scientific progress, as I recall, and I was counting bubbles.  Yes, I spent all day every day blowing bubbles into soapy water, videotaping the bubble-making action, and then watching the instant replay in slow-mo over and over and over with a clicker counter and a ruler.  This mental stimulation occurred in Earle Hall.  It's no coincidence that you can rearrange the letters of Earle Hall to spell "a real hell."  A future as a female chemical engineer making serious bank was summarily ejected from my mind.  We bonded over small-town similarities both big and small, from where we were when Kurt Cobain died to our theories over what was in Marsellus Wallace's briefcase (his soul?  The diamonds from reservoir dogs?  Mia's gold-wrapped coke stash?)  Fast forward a couple years, when to our deep chagrin, we both end up back at Clemson.  We fell in with BBJ&M, Jessie, Josh, Lee, Alison and a host of others, struggled through studio and internet romance, touched REM, and threw up a lot of White Russians before the Big Lebowski made them cool.  We were separated when I decided I needed to milk Clemson for all it was worth and spend three consecutive semesters off campus, studying architecture in its natural habitats.  Two of those semesters happened to be in Italy, which brings us, in my typical round-about manner, to the story at hand...  Karen,myself, and our stalwart companion Bridget decided we needed to take advantage of my semi-familiarity with Europe to have an adventure, so they flew in when my Spring semester was done to meet up with me for a Grand Tour.  We hit all the highlights and proceeded to drink the dregs of life as best we could on a scanty budget and limited Let's Go Europe information.  I cut the tip of my thumb off in Switzerland, Bridget took lots of pictures with men wearing strange pants, and we were all but molested by manic Manchester fans after they won the European World Cup in Barcelona, but the highlighted adventure of the day took place in Munich at the famed Hofbrauhaus.  The Hofbrauhaus is a huge beerhall patronized by a strange cross-segment of the world's population.  Apparently it appeals to tourists of all stripes and Munich locals, and on this particular night the patrons were shoulder to shoulder.  The Bavarian band was pumping, the pretzel girls were twirling, and there was leiderhosen everywhere.  Although there are about 700 booths in the place, not a single one of them was open, so we joined a German couple who kindly invited us over.  The wife had short spiky hair the color of Angela's on  My So-Called-Life  and spoke almost no English.  The husband wore Birkenstocks with fuschia socks and a handlebar mustache.  He proceeded to regale us with stories of how lame Berlin was compared to Munich ("In Munich there is  living !  There is no living in Berlin!  In Munich there is  beer !  There is no beer in Berlin!") while we drank dunkel out of steins as big as my head.  Bridget randomly ran into a friend from home and took their reunion outside, and our happy little party was then crashed by a guy who vaguely resembled Kevin Spacey as Keyser Soze.  He was more than a little impressed by Karen's charms.  He kept telling us he was British, but as the facts have it, he must have gotten there by way of the Ukraine.  He attempted to turn Karen's head by promising her a BMW if she would spend the rest of her life with him, or at least one night, and when her kind protestations did not have the desired effect of removing his hand from her breast, I had to intervene.  He turned on me, teeth bared like the proverbial ravening wolf, and informed me that if I interfered between him and his soulmate I would surely regret it, at which time he attempted to drag Karen into the dark Munich night.  Then our German friend and he got into a serious verbal altercation, which was, unfortunately for my narrative, entirely in German, and security arrived on the scene.  Fisticuffs ensued, including a beer stein to the head and an uppercut to the jaw, and the Ukranian Kevin Spacey was summarily ejected from the establishment.  When the dust from the fracas settled, our erstwhile German female companion just shook her head and pronounced, "Bad man.  Bad, bad, man.  No go with.  Trouble."  We had to agree.  Karen, I salute you on this, your twenty-seventh birthday.  You are the only woman I've ever met who instigated a bar fight with nothing but a black V-neck T-shirt.  How proud I am to call you friend!

      For those of you who haven't heard my hunger pangs yet, my endocrinologist informed me three weeks and five days ago that I had 12-15 months before I would almost certainly develop Type II adult-onset diabetes.  Apparently my blood sugar/standing insulin level was through the roof.  Four years of going to one doctor or another twice a week and this was the first I'd heard of it.  With all the treatments, drugs, and impossible-graduate-program-in-addition-to-life-threatening-illness-of-half-my-family stress of the past few years, I knew I had gained weight and I was very uncomfortable with it, but my old endocrinologist always said it was a result of my pituitary/thyroid failure, and that when we got all that straightened out, my body would just return to normal.  I had decided on my own to speed up the process, and I embarked this year on a 2004 Transformation that was slowly but surely working- steady exercise, healthy eating choices, blah blah blah.  It's been determined now that that won't work fast enough to stave off the diabetes, though, so now it's official- I must starve for a few months.    Eating absolutely no carbohydrates (which trigger the production of insulin in your body) is the same as the Atkins diet, which I always thought was just a load.  But on the Atkins diet, you can eat as much protein, eggs, cheese, dairy, and saturated fat as you want.  My please-Lord-help-me-avoid-diabetes-on-1200-calories-a-day diet, on the other hand, allows only 8 ounces of lean protein, one teaspoon of olive oil, and one teaspoon of nuts a day.  Everything else I eat is a non-starchy vegetable.  Can I just tell you how atrociously hard this was the first week?  Hellacious is probably the only word for my body's torment at not only doing without its favorite energy source, but making do with less than half the caloric input it regularly got per day pre-diet.  By now, the worst of the withdrawal is over, and I generally feel very good on a daily basis.  The sweaty shakes that I used to get after meals are a thing of the past, and I no longer ride a physiological roller coaster based on when and what I last ate.  The scary thing is that I had no idea that those feelings were at all related to my diet.  I just chalked them up to being in less than stellar health.  For the last two weeks, I had really lost the desire for sugary and starchy foods.  Today, for some reason, I would like nothing better than to mow down several hamburgers and orders of fries and double fist it with a Coke and a milkshake.  Instead, I'm going home to eat a Caesar salad.  As I've learned from my dear friend Bridget Scott, "It sucks that this is not a part of my lifestyle anymore."  I'll tell you what I want more than that hamburger- a continuation of a lifestyle that doesn't include insulin.  I'll save my needles and veins for smack.

      today at work.  This job is bizarre in that the work is incredibly easy, but my boss thinks it's incredibly challenging.  The only challenging thing about it is keeping myself awake.  Well,  that and handling the inevitable timecrunches that occur because my boss doesn't have the first understanding of what I do.  She understands what she needs from me and what I can deliver, but not how it is accomplished.    For example, she gives me a room of furniture to draft into an existing drawing on Monday and wants to know if I can complete it by Thursday.  Hello, I can complete it in fifteen minutes.  Then later that same day, she'll hand me a handwritten notepad covered in her looping scrawl from a meeting two weeks ago and tell me she needs the changes discussed therein made, which, once I've finally deciphered them, amount to a complete and total redesign of the house .  And she needs them within the hour.  People, let me just tell you, changes like that take days.    I've tried to educate her for the entire six months I've been here as to what is a reasonable amount of time to allow for me to accomplish the various and sundry tasks that are necessary to convey our design ideas to the client, and I could always meet her needs in a timely fashion because, as we have already established, the work is embarrassingly easy.  However, I never know what is needed until whenever it crosses her mind to tell me about it.  I can't ever get a jump on anything that will be an extended project because I don't know about it in advance, and no matter how many conversations we have about it, I can't seem to impress upon her how much more smoothly her business would run if I were in the loop.    I don't think it's that she doesn't want to let me into the proverbial loop- I am getting concerned that she has some serious short- and long-term memory problems that rob her of the ability to keep a mental hold on information that she needs to transfer to me.  It takes the stimulus of a looming meeting or deadline to remind her of what she's going to need.  Lots of times she thinks she's told me about something days ago, and an hour before she needs it is the first I ever hear about it.    Case in point, the last twenty minutes.  I've been busy trying to occupy myself with this blogpost for the prior thirty minutes because I have absolutely no work to do, including the usual deadfiling busywork that piles up- I did all that weeks ago.  She blows into the office at 10:30, needing to be at a meeting 20 minutes away at 11:00.  She proceeds to attempt to review with us everything she needs us to accomplish in the 10 days she'll be gone on a "business" trip.  That takes eight minutes.  Then she tells me that she needs two drawings printed and some digital photographs to take to this meeting.  Perhaps if I could have instantaneously developed the ability to stop time, I could have accomplished that.  Otherwise, it was definitively impossible.  I calmly informed her that I could not make that happen for her in the time she had available.  She wasn't happy, and neither was I- my happiness is contingent upon doing an awesome job.  I can't do an awesome job when I don't have the information I need.  Period.  So now I am feeling seriously perturbed.  An hour ago, when I first started this post, I was just bored.  This shows a major increase in emotional intensity over the past sixty minutes with no signs of abating.  If the trend continues, I'll be having a quiet moment of nuclear meltdown in 3.4 hours...

      and less like an intellectual poseur.  What am I doing with this blog, anyway?  I don't want people to know my real thoughts.   I  don't even want to know my real thoughts.  Do I think at all?  Or is it all just involuntary physiological response due to my cultural environmental programming?  Am I the equivalent of the proverbial monkeys on the proverbial typewriters banging out the proverbial Shakespearean sonnets?  Sometimes it feels that way, especially when I look at the blank sheet on the drafting board.  I want to fill it.  I need to fill it.  I have to fill it.  But  how do I fill it?
