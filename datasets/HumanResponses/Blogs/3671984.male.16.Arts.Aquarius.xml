      okay... i've been really upset recently... and i wrote a poem... but it ended up sounding like a monologue... so i started writing a one act play... and over the summer i'm going to finish it with editing and stuff so that i can try to have it published... it's called Hide and Seek... and it's a bunch of adults playing 7 year olds (and one playing an 8 year old)... every kid is different... has their own weakness and stregnth... it's kind of like... kids knowing too much... like they know more than adults... it's interesting... at least i think so... if you think so too, ask me about it and i'll keep you updated with it and stuff... okay... cya

      you make me so mad.  you know who you are... and if you don't... you should.  you're not who you used to be... you're not the person who used to like to be around me... you're not the person i liked to be around... you've changed... and it's not a good thing... ever since this relationship, you've pushed me aside farther and farther away.  You treat me like i'm your goddamn servant! and i hate it!... you know what... we're not soulmates ... don't go on tour... see if i care... you want me to stay in harmony until you leave cause you need a dance partner... you're so effin selfish... you don't care that i've had 6 hours of sleep in the past week or that this problem has been making me physically sick to the point of vometing... or that it's so emotionally distressing that it's brought me to the point that you originally brought me out of... that i brought you out of too... or did you forget about that?  don't talk to me

      Due to multiple requests... (Reggie and Laura)... I have decided to keep a journal because "(my) life is so damn interesting"   it's about 11:26... in the morning... on a saturday... i didn't even know saturdays had mornings   i'm up... i've eaten... i emptied the dishwasher... and i'm home alone   my sister is at Baley's or however you spell it... the gym... she's a personal trainer... it's funny... her and her friend went clubbing last night... and when they got home they were puking forever... it was very humorous... but shh!!! my sis made me promise i wouldn't tell my parents... she also made me promise not to tell that my brother never came home last night... that he spent the night at his girlfriend's house... oh... by the way... my parents are at the shore with their friends... they spent the night... so... who do i stay loyal to?... my parents who are gonna check with me to make sure my brother was in by 2?... or my sister who i promised i wouldn't tell... parents... sister... people who've paid for everything i've ever done and brought me into this world......... or my sister?   i decided... i'd tell my parents... but only if they asked   i'm such a little knave and i love it   okay... i have to go mow the front lawn... (another thing i promised my sister)... and then... voy a dos fiestas... one is a sweet 16 for katie!!! and the other is a grad for shaun!!!   oh yeah... HAPPY BIRTHDAY CLAIRE!!!
