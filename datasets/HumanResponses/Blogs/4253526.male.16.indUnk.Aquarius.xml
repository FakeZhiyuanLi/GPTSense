      Cel-shading is a style of rendering computer-generated imagery that resembles hand-drawn, cartoon images, in contrast to photorealistic renderings. Some of the latest games that have used cel-shading are the Legend of Zelda: Winda Waker, Jet Set radio Future, and XIII.

      Nintendo is an amazing company with an amazing history, they are a very innovative and ingenious company. But their daring innovation has cost them before with products like the Virtual Boy. The DS will feature a PDA style stylus and touch screen. It uses Memory cards and is backward compatible with other Game Boy games. The graphic capabilties are nowhere near as advanced as the PSP, the DS has graphics equivalent to that of a Nintendo 64 on any standard television. One cool feature is the Wireless gaming feature which allows you to connect to people within 30 to 100 feet with up to 16 players. The unit is pwered by ARM7 and ARM9 processors which can process up to 60 frames per second. Will update when more details are announced.

      One of the most innovative and best selling game franchises returns this Fall. Grand theft Auto: San Andreas puts you in the role of CJ a man trying to survive in the streets of the State of San Andreas. San Andreas is comprised of three large cities Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Ventura which are modified versions of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. San Andreas is five times the size of Vice City whic equals almost endless gameplay. Those tired of the load times in vice city when going from place to place will be happy to know that they have done away with the loading between different areas. One problem I had with vice City was that you couldn't swim and it was really easy to fall in the water and that became frustrating, but now you can swim by tapping the X button. You can participate in four person drive-by's by recruiting other gang members to help you. Bicycles are also featured in this game being controlled just like running by tapping the X button to go faster. You can also now dual-wield weapons, gamble at a casino, and get haircuts. Eating and working out are now a big part in the game to. The more you eat the fatter you get and the less you eat the opposite effect occurs. This also affects the characters attributes such as how fast he runs or swims. Working out at the gym also affects your character. This game is destined for greatness, I will update when more details are released.

      When E3 2004 rolled around this year Son'ys Playstation portable took everyones breath away with its amazing technology and graphics. It has all of the the original Playstation controllers buttons except L2, R2, and the Right analog stick. The Lithium-Ion Battery will last 2 to 10 hours depending on what you are using it for. It has the capabilities of wireless multiplayer gaming and connection to the internet. Memory is save on MagicGate's Memory Stick Pro Duo. The PSP is destined to be one of the greatest leaps into the future of Handheld gaming. I will update with more details when more are released.

       As an extremely huge fan of the Final Fantasy Series and Role Playing Game Genre I was very disappointed when watching G-Phoria and seeing the portrayal of Rikku(FFX, FFX-2) by Adult Film Star Anna Nicole Smith. Smith is not only a complete Moron with an IQ equivelent to that of a Cowboy boot but she also has never played a Video game in her life nor familiar with anything in the Video Game Universe.  I am very disappointed with G4.    Pics of Anna Nicole Smith making other Female Video Game Characters look Ridiculous.(Ivy from Soul calibur 2, and Farah from Prince of Persia.)  urlLink   http://www.g4techtv.com/feature.aspx?article_key=47770
