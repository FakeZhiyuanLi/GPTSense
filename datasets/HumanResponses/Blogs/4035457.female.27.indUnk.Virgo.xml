      (Pictures attached!)  As a member of this particular blogger community I've had the opportunity to check out other people's blogs to see what they're writing about. I came across  urlLink Polco's blog  and found that she's a Japanese girl who lived in London for a while but is back in her hometown of Sapporo, Hokkaido. Reading her posts reminded me of my stay in Japan (I lived there for a year and a half). I told her that one of the places I visited in Japan was Sapporo, for the yuki matsuri (snow festival).   The yuki matsuri is held every February and goes on for a week. Like most festivals, there's food, games, music, and souveneir stands, but the main reason to come is for the sculptures. Beautiful, intricate, frosty sculptures are carved out of snow for the public to enjoy. Many of the artists are from various companies in Sapporo, but some are built (I was told) by the Japanese Special Defense Forces as part of their exercise. There's also an international contest in which people from other countries have only a couple of days to create a sculpture according to a set theme.  My boyfriend and I got there a couple of days early, so we had the chance to see the artists in action. We were astounded to find that most artists only used a bucket of water, a spade, and their HANDS. Yep, that's it!  However, not all the sculptures are made of snow. Susukino street hosts ice sculptures, and although there aren't nearly as many as the snow sculptures, they're just as beautiful and just as intricate. Since these are made of ice, the artists had one more tool at hand- a chainsaw.  There must have been hundreds of sculptures, and I couldn't take pictures of all of them. I still took a lot of pictures though, but in the interest of space I've put up just a few. Click on the thumbnails for the full pictures.       urlLink     Yes, it's me and....Pikachu! I look like a masked bandit because the temperature was like, in the negative numbers. Being a native Californian, I ain't never been that cold in my whole life.     urlLink     Remember- EVERYTHING is made of snow, including the statues, the columns in front of the statues (the chains are plastic though), AND the platform the whole thing is sitting on!     urlLink     Caw! Feed me! Hehehe....just to show you just how big some of these things are.     urlLink     Here's one of the ice sculptures. Note the detail on the fish's scales. Mind you, this thing was almost as big as a car- not something you'd find on some fancy dinner table.     urlLink     Here's another ice sculpture-this time of a castle. There were these colored lights that reflected off the castle that changed every few seconds. It looked really cool.     urlLink     Of course, no trip to Sappro was complete without going to the Sapporo beer garden. We had a great time cooking our own food on little grills on our table while washing them down with Sapporo beer. Unfortunately for me though, my beer glass was a little too close to the fire, and a lot of grease splattered right inside it. After a while there were these gross chunks of solidified fat floating in my beer.

      Picture this: You’re a devoted reader of the Lord of the Rings books. You’ve read them countless times over the years. You’ve collected them all, including the more obscure ones that were never made into movies. Your posts on Tolkien fansites are in Elvish- Sindarin Elvish, thankyouverymuch. Now you’re sitting in the theatre halfway through (meaning about 1 ½ hours)  The Two Towers  when you realize with great horror, that something is seriously wrong with the scene unfolding before you:   Faramir, Captain of Gondor, tries to take the One Ring from Frodo. Furthermore, he takes Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath.  Nowhere in the book do these events occur.  “That never happened in the book!” you scream inwardly. “That completely changes Faramir’s character! What the bloody f@!# was Peter Jackson thinking?!??!?!”  What, indeed, what Peter Jackson thinking when he did this? What was Wolfgang Petersen thinking when he took out the gods and goddesses when he directed  Troy ? What was Sam Raimi thinking when he had the Green Goblin kidnap Mary Jane instead of Gwen Stacy (not to mention letting her survive the fall) in  Spider-Man ?  Several reasons lie behind the madness that seems to befall these directors and writers when converting a book (or comic book) into celluloid form. One of the simplest explanations is time and length of the movie. Each of the LOTR movies already pass the 3 hour mark, and not counting the DVD Extended Editions. Can you imagine how long each movie would be if Jackson was faithful to the book to a T? We’d turn into bats as our eyes lose the ability to endure sunlight if we ever spend that long in a movie theater.  A second reason is appeal to the general public. Raimi didn’t direct the two Spider-Man movies just for web-heads. He wants everyone to watch them, including those who have never picked up a comic book in their entire lives. My grandpa, who knew next to nothing about Spider-Man, watched the sequel a few weeks ago out of curiosity. He liked it so much that he actually rented the first movie to see how the story began. Consequently, if Bryan Singer wanted to properly tell the story of the X-Men in his movies, he would have to intricately describe the background of EACH AND EVERY CHARACTER in the movie. Considering there were about 10 different X-Men in the movie, not to mention the future X-Men (the kids in the school), the average moviegoer could and would never sit for this.  A third reason is for artistic purposes. Petersen had mentioned that he wanted to tell the story of the Trojan war from a more realistic, historical viewpoint. Thus Zeus and his comrades had to go.  Another reason is that the change serves as a plot device. Jackson chose to alter Faramir’s character because he wanted to show that, like his older brother Boromir (and all other men who had come in contact with the Ring), Faramir was tempted by it. However, unlike his brother, he was able to fight the temptation. Jackson wanted to show the change in Faramir; perhaps Jackson meant to show that there is still strength in men to withstand power, greed, and corruption. I dunno.  Script writers and directors walk a fine line in appeasing the loyal literary fans and the general movie crowd. If they’re not faithful to the book, they’re ripped apart by the book fans, but if they stick too close to the book they’re criticized by others as just copying the book page by page with no imagination. So let’s give them a break and appreciate the book and the movie separately.

      So here I am, spending my summer vacation writing on this blog, anxiously waiting for my second year of grad school to start. I think to myself, “Yes, just 4-5 more years of school, then I’ll have my PhD in applied social psychology, get a kickass job, and make tons of moolah for the rest of my life!” In the meantime though, I’m broke as a joke. I’m 27 years old, but I had to move back in with my parents to afford (barely) going to school. I have only a part time job, but I can’t get a full time job since school keeps me extremely busy.&nbsp;Last year I often&nbsp;had to forgo sleep and weekend outings with my family to get schoolwork done. And I think to myself, “Is it all worth it?”    At this point in my life I should be married, perhaps with a child, but definitely working. I see friends and relatives moving up and moving on while I sit in front of my textbooks finishing up yet another grueling assignment. I wonder what my life would be had I not gone into grad school and continued working. How different would it be? Would I make as much money without going to grad school as I would with an MA or PhD? Would I be making a lot of money? Where would I be living?  I’ve heard a lot of success stories from people who made it big without the need of higher education. Many people with just a high school diploma have led happy, successful lives. My mom's boss (one of the top CEO's, I think) at her former job in Transamerica started out as a mailroom clerk. Some who do go on to college or grad school have dropped out along the way, but that didn’t hinder them. Didn’t Bill Gates drop out of college? I don’t think he’s doing too shabbily. At the same time, there are high school graduates who become stuck in dead end jobs. They can’t apply for higher positions because those require a college or graduate degree. Looking at even another angle, there are those with a college- or even a graduate degree- who cant’ seem to find a job, are in a low paying job, or are unhappy with their current job.   So what is the answer to this confusion then? Should people spend (or borrow) tens of thousands of dollars for higher education in the chance that they’ll have a larger choice of high paying jobs upon graduation? Or should they start working after high school/college to get their feet wet in the workforce right away, but at the risk of taking just whatever job they could find and become unhappy with it over the years?   As for me, for now I’ll soldier on with grad school. I don’t know if I’ll make it all the way, but I’ll try my darndest to do so.

       urlLink     I guess some folks just don't give a damn.&nbsp; urlLink   &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;  I found this  urlLink Navy safety center  website, which contains photos featuring people doing really, really unsafe things in the name of convenience, laziness, indifference, or ignorance. It’s amazing to see what people are capable are doing. One of&nbsp;the more interesting submissions involve the geniuses who stack ladders on top of each other to make them longer while they work on a roof, or&nbsp;some other really high place.&nbsp;&nbsp;    On some occasions I personally have witnessed stupid, unsafe&nbsp;things people have done. I cringe to imagine what would happen if and when their luck runs out. For example, in escalators at shopping malls there are always signs posted at the entrance warning that strollers are not supposed to be used on them. It makes perfect sense. What sane, caring&nbsp;mother with any intelligence would risk her child’s life by forcing a stroller onto an escalator? Yet I’ve seen time and time again mothers and fathers driving the strollers onto the escalator with their baby still attached to it, confident that they can prevent the stroller in time from hurtling down the escalator while knocking other innocent people off it. I don’t understand why these parents can’t find a safer way of going up and down floors. If there is more than one adult, one person can hold on the baby while the other can hold on to the folded up stroller. That way, baby makes it SAFELY to the destination. If there’s only one parent available, then use the elevator, for god’s sake! Is an infant's life worth the five minutes that it takes to hunt down an elevator or fold up a stroller? The problem has nothing to do with sign visibility- these warning signs are often large, in bright red on yellow or white background. Also, it has nothing to do with language barriers- I’ve seen many signs in another language; furthermore, the sign is often accompanied by a graphic. Surely people understand pictures, right?&nbsp;   Another dangerously stupid thing I’ve often seen people do occurs near my house. I live in a gated community, and outside the gate is a very long, wide, winding&nbsp;stretch of road where the average speed is 50mph. The odd thing is that&nbsp;in spite of&nbsp;the&nbsp;nice, wide sidewalk, many joggers like to jog right on the street! Sometimes they’re practically in the middle of the road! And when you honk at them to get them to move, THEY actually get mad at YOU- how dare you try to drive on their street! What’s even more frightening is that at times the women joggers are even pushing strollers on the road! I have no idea why the road with the whizzing cars is so much more appealing to these people than the nice, safe sidewalk. Is the asphalt more comfortable to run on than concrete? I don’t know.   I know of two other incidents that, while weren’t really dangerous, are still examples of people ignoring the rules. Both instances occurred in Japan. The first story was when I was at Narita airport. Now, for those who don’t know, many Japanese are avid smokers. They will much smoke pretty much wherever they damn well please, even when there is an obvious “No Smoking” sign. I was riding the escalator when I noticed the man in front of me light up a cigarette. He casually puffed his cigarette even though several large universal symbols for “No Smoking” (the red circle and slash on the cigarette) were located right on the escalator arm. I wish I had a picture. The second incident took place near my old place of work. Take a look at the picture. This was a small area outside my building that clearly had a “no bicycles” sign on it- recognizable in any language. But lo and behold- what do we see? Several bicycles parked here! Truly, truly unbelievable.   Have you witnessed any stupid human tricks as well? Tell your story.

      The other night I was surfing the web when I read that George Lucas has finally chosen and unveiled the title to the third Star Wars movie, which is   urlLink Revenge of the Sith  . After shaking my head in disappointment over yet another crappy title (makes me think of "Revenge of the Nerds"), I headed over to the  urlLink official Star Wars  website to see if there was more news about it.    On the site I found some information about the anticipated release of the "Original" trilogy in DVD form. Clicking on the link took me to Amazon, where you can preorder the DVD's. I decided to read the reviews about the movies. So far, about 870 people have "reviewed" the DVD's, in spite of them having not yet been released. Therefore, they are merely comments about their feelings towards the DVDs.   The thing to consider is that, despite being marketed as the "Original" trilogy, many fans were incensed to find that in fact, the DVDs won't feature the 1977, 1980, and 1983 releases of  A New Hope ,  Empire Strikes Back , and  Return of the Jedi  but rather the 1997 Special Edition versions of them. Furthermore, to piss them off even more, there are rumors that Lucas will add more changes to these DVD versions. One particular rumor that sent SW fans foaming at the mouth is the notion of superimposing the digitally aged face of Hayden Christiansen (as Anakin Skywalker) over Sebastian Shaw's (the guy who played the old Anakin) ghostly face in Return of the Jedi. Many fans have not forgiven Lucas for the changes he made in the 1997 SEs (Greedo shooting at Han first in ANH; Luke screaming like a little girl as he fell in ESB; replacing the "Yub-Yub" song in ROTJ), and many on Amazon have vowed not to buy the DVD when it comes out. Could you imagine what they'd do if indeed Hayden's smirking face replaces&nbsp;the original actor's ghostly visage?&nbsp;Let's put it this way: one person even went so far as to say that he wouldn't even accept them as a present!   There were some comments that seem more levelheaded. Some fans said that they didn't really mind the changes in the movies. What's a few added scenes? Others mention that since it's Lucas' movie, he's free to do what he wants with it. Still others have said that they actually preferred the Special Editions to the original releases. I did, in fact, like what they did with the Cloud City scenes in ESB.   My take on this whole debate is that, while I disagreed with some of the changes Lucas made in the&nbsp;1997 SEs&nbsp;( honestly, Greedo had to have been BLIND to miss Han like that! He was sitting RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM, for pete's sake! ), it isn't something to get really riled up over. It would truly, royally suck if Lucas does superimpose Hayden's face in ROTJ, but I won't boycott him or vow never to watch the SEs. And in spite of how much the other two prequels bit, I'm definitely watching the final installment to this story. Everyone and their mother has been waiting for eons to witness the legendary duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan by the volcano.   I think some of the more ardent fans should just relax! It's just a movie. Being loyal to the original releases is one thing, but to get so riled up over it is another. Besides, if they REALLY wanted the original, "Original Trilogy" on DVD, they can either get bootlegs (usually gleaned from the laserdiscs) on Ebay or just get the VHS versions.   What about you guys...what do you think? Is it fair of fans to get really upset over releasing the SE version of the films on DVD instead of the original 70's-80's releases? Or are they just overreacting over some silly sci-fi movies made 30 years ago? Share your thoughts :)

      Greetings, and welcome all to my very first blog. Hey, what can I say? I've joined the masses. Now I can wax philosophically, vent, praise, etc. about anything I feel like....and you all can make comments!    Before I continue, I just wanted to set up a couple of  ground rules.  I'm not trying to be strict- I just want to make sure that my blog stays nice and happy. Please follow them.    1.) Anyone and everyone is free to make comments on my posts, even if they disagree with me.&nbsp;Just be polite to me and to the others who make comments. Don't call people stupid or make fun of them just because their opinions are different from yours, or if they don't have correct information.   2.) This is a PG-13 site, which means that light cussing and is allowed, but extremely crude remarks won't be tolerated. If you feel that a severe swear word is the only way you can get your point across, censor yourself in the grand tradition of Looney Tunes characters ("Shut the f#$* up!")   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  On to lighter issues... ^_^   For those of you who have no idea what the title of my blog means, it's actually a Japanese sentence that translates to, "I like No Face". NOW you're wondering, what on earth is a No Face?!?!? You see, in the Japanese animated film  Spirited Away , there's this character called No Face. I'm not quite sure what he was supposed to be (some sort of spirit or something), but anyway he's kinda cute....until he starts eating some of the other characters in the movie. Then it's just really funny. He never says anything except "ehhh....unhhh....ehhh..." over and over. I'll put up a picture of him once&nbsp;I figure out how to post photos on my blog :)  Spirited Away  is a really good movie, even if you're not too familiar with Japanese culture. The story is really interesting and the animation is well done. I highly recommend it. Basically, the story is about a little girl named Chihiro, who, on her way to moving to a new home with her parents, becomes involved in the magical world of spirits and gods. When Chihiro's parents inadvertently offend the spirits, they are punished by being turned into pigs, and it's up to Chihiro to rescue them and turn them back to humans.   NOW you may ask, "Why the hell did she call her blog  Kaonashi Ga Suki ?" Well, the answer is- I don't know. I just wanted to call my blog something really unique. Besides, I really do like No Face!    Spirited Away  was created by the great Hayao Miyazaki, who is considered as the Walt Disney of Japan. Another classic Miyazaki film is  Princess Mononoke , which I rented recently. This film seems longer than  Spirited Away , and is more serious. Also well done,  Princess Mononoke  involves a young prince named Ashitaka who is cursed by a demon upon defeating it. Desperate to find a way to lift the curse, he leaves his town and finds himself caught between several warring factions: the industrial town of Irontown, the emperor and his men, and the animal spirits of the forest. While initially this may seem like your basic "man vs. nature" story, it goes deeper than that, and you'll just have to watch it for yourself. I have to warn you though- it's a PG-13, and with good reason.   Funny how my greeting turned into movie reviews :) Well, that's enough Miyazaki movie talk&nbsp;for now. I'll save my review of  My Neighbor Totoro  for next time.

      I'm sure many of you have heard about phising, a scam that involves sending unsuspecting people emails that supposedly come from real businesses as a means to trick them into divulging private information such as credit card numbers, bank accounts, and passwords. It may look like an email sent from Ebay, PayPal, or Citibank. In the past it was relatively easy to spot a phish: the email would have terrible typos, or the email address looks really fake. However, these days the crooks have become more sophisticated, creating phish emails that look almost exactly like the real thing.   On the  urlLink PC Magazine  website, I found a link that takes you to a site in which you can  urlLink test your ability  to discern true business emails from the frauds. According to PC Magazine, 28% of adults can't tell the difference. I took the test and found that I got 8 out of 10 correct. It's pretty scary to know that I have a 20% chance of giving away my private, important information to crooks. In fact, I know it to be true since I fell for such a scam a year ago.  I received what I thought was a legitimate email from Ebay saying something about needing my username and password because they were updating their database. I did have my suspicions so I checked out the links on the page. They seemed to work ok. I also took a look at the email address, and it too seemed legit. So stupid me sends them my username and password.  A few minutes after sending the email I just had a very bad feeling I did something wrong. I noticed there was one link that I hadn't seen, so I copied and pasted the URL onto my broswer and went to the site. Imagine my horror when I saw a bunch of weird German writing! So I went to the Ebay website and asked them if they had sent emails that looked like the one I received. I described the email in detail and sent a text copy to them.  Several hours later my fears were confirmed when Ebay replied, explaining that they don't send emails like that and that most likely my email was a fake. Upon hearing this, I then wondered if the strange German writing said, "HA HA HA, STUPID AMERICAN. YOU ARE SCREWED." I immediately changed my Ebay password and username.  So what is the moral of the story? Be careful in reading your emails! Make doubly sure that email is legit. Hell, in fact, don't trust any business emails that you receive. Go straight to the real website instead.

      This is, without a doubt, one of the coolest things I ever saw in a train in Japan:    urlLink     In the grand tradition of American celebrities who do ads only in foreign countries, Our Favorite Family sponsors CC Lemon, a lemonade type drink. I guess somebody thought that it only made sense for yellow-skinned characters to advertise a yellow drink ^_^    urlLink     Unfortunately the right half came out rather dark, on account of me forgetting to turn on the flash. D'oh!

      I now have a greater sense of admiration for web designers.  Yesterday was the third day at my temporary summer job. I work for one of the departments at my school. During summer most of the student employees are unavailable, and a skeleton crew runs this office, which is usually not a big problem. They're busy, but they can handle it. However, this year the staff realized that, in addition to their usual duties, they had to update their website. For some reason the university decided to change servers (or something like that), and all the departments have to migrate alllllllll the information from their existing, respective websites, to the new one. Every link, every picture and graphic, must move. Here's where I come in.   Rather than hire a professional and pay them up the ass per hour, they hired lil' ol' me to do the job for less pay. Still, the Fates were smiling down on me as this job was basically served to me on a platter. Fortunately I have a little experience with web design, fortunately I was starving for a job, and fortunately I was on campus.  So I've spent the past 3 weekdays migrating all the stuff from one place to the other, making sure the links work, etc. Then they tell me I also have to update the site, which meant making brand spanking new pages and adding more photos. I never realized how tedious such a job was. I spent most of Monday creating new icons. I spent all of Tuesday cropping photos to make sure they fit exactly right on the page. Yesterday I started redesigning the home page- not an easy task. Today...I don't know yet. I do know that my mouse hand and wrist hurts and I have a headache everyday (though this may also be due to my contacts). I worry I might get carpal tunnel, but I can't stop working. It's amazing that my eyes and right wrist still have enough strength to write for this blog regularly.  To think what I'm doing is small potatoes compared to what real web designers do. How do you guys do it without givng yourselves carpal tunnel? DO you have carpal tunnel? How do you combat it?  I had no idea how tough and tedious it can be to design a site. I have to give you all props *salute*.

      About a year ago my mom was having a conversation with one of her relatives (I can't mention what the exact relation is between them). For some reason they started talking about me and my boyfriend, and naturally the subject of marriage came up. Now, the significant others of this woman's children happen to be Filipino while my boyfriend is of mixed European descent. As they watched another relative's Eurasian child playing nearby, the woman chuckled and said to my mom,"  You're so lucky. You'll get to have grandchildren who look like that  ."   Mind you, there's nothing wrong with this woman's potential son/daughter in laws. They're not jerks, and they're not hideously deformed-in fact, they're good looking. Why then, did she seem regretful that they're only Filipinos? What will her future grandchildren miss out by not being half-Caucasian? What exactly does European blood contribute to the Filipino gene pool?  It seems to me that some Asians think that having a white boyfriend/girlfriend/spouse is like having a trophy to show off to others. If your special someone happens to be white, then by golly you're super cool! You're special and unique! Your girlfriend is Scandanavian, German, and Russian while all your ( insert Asian ethnicity here ) friends' girlfriends are just plain old ( insert Asian ethnicity here ). How boring for them, huh?  I'm sure some of you have seen (or possess) pictures featuring groups of Asians. The family gathering. The senior prom. Some relative's birthday. A wedding. In many of these pictures you'll find, amidst the sea of yellow or brown faces, a lost white guy in the back. "Aha," you say to yourself. "What's this? This guy's someone's boyfriend. I'll bet it's this girl," as you point to the Asian girl nearest him. She tends to have this look on her face like, "Yaaa...I snagged me a white dude. Beat that biatches!"       I don't understand where this feeling of competition comes from. For example, my sister serves in a youth ministry at our church with other teens in preparation for Confirmation. Like many Catholic churches, the majority of the congregation is Filipino, as are the youth ministry kids themselves. Of the 15 kids in my sister's group, only 3 are white- 2 girls and one boy. While many of the Filipino boys in her group aren't exactly bad looking, all the (Filipino) girls flock towards this boy, constantly flirting with him. Why? What makes him more attractive to these girls?  What's the big deal, honestly? What is it about white people that Asians find so appealing? Is it simply because they're different from us? Do Chinese/Japanese/Filipinos/etc simply grow tired of their own kind and feel the need for variety? Or is there more to it? Do they do it to spite their rigid, traditional families? Or is it possible that Asians suffer from an inferiority complex? That "white is right"? I don't know.  You now may want to ask, "Well Toni, what about you- why do YOU have a white boyfriend? Why don't you have a Filipino boyfriend then?" Well, the answer is simple, and it leads to my third possible answer: maybe some Asians just prefer white people more than their own kind, just like some people prefer mangos to grapes. Maybe there is no subconcious reason for this phenomena. Could it be just a matter of taste? Perhaps. At least for me, I simply have a thing for white guys. I can be attracted to all sorts of guys, but white guys are what attracts me the most. I've felt this way my whole life.  On the flip side, some Asians can be very traditional, as I had briefly mentioned earlier. Rather than viewing them as a prize, a white boyfriend/girlfriend may be unacceptable to some Asian families, who prefer that their son or daughter date someone of their own kind. One of my Asian friends is currently dating a white guy, and she still hasn't told her family about him because she knows they won't accept him. On the opposite side of the same spectrum, a white friend of mine told me that his Chinese ex-girlfriend's family had never really made him feel welcome.  I'd like to hear people's thoughts on this topic.

      My teenage sister Stef has a sort of blog (see link) on this site called MySpace, but it's more of a chatting community. It's a great tool for her- since she can't really go out much during summer vacation, she can still keep in touch with her friends online by sending little messages to each other. Sometimes she lets me read these messages, and I am flabbergasted at how they write.  No, I'm not talking about crude sexual remarks and swearing- that's a given in any teen conversation. What surprised me are the frequent, abusive uses of "netspeak". You know what I mean- the shorthand form of writing, often used in chat rooms to communicate what you want to say in as little time as possible. Here's a small sample for the uninitiated:  ppl= people brb= I'll be right back cya l8er= I'll see you later IIRC= If I remember (recall) correctly LOL= laughing out loud wut=what  The list goes on.  Don't get me wrong- I use these shortcuts as well when I'm online chatting with friends. And yes, I also sometimes use them when I'm emailing. However, the amount of netspeak I use pales in comparison to how they're used by my sister's peers. It's bad enough that their messages are laden with spelling and grammatical errors. I don't mean to sound like the grammar police- I make mistakes too. However, is it too much to ask that a 16-year old know how to spell the word "phone", and to know the difference between "their", "there", and "they're"? And now they've taken the English language to a whole new level- to a point where it's almost unrecognizable.  The notion of teenagers creating words only they would understand is not exactly a new concept. At that age, teens want to establish their identity, separate from that of their parents and others. Yet at the same time they want to belong -hence, all the cliques that develop in school- and having something in common (fashion, music, way of speaking) with their peers does just that. But what is the price that the younger generation is paying by using netspeak as a means of bonding?  I've read articles that talk about students turning in homework using the same netspeak and poor grammar. We aren't just talking about elementary school-age children; we're talking about seniors in high school, who should know better that "ppl" is unacceptable in a formal term paper. In some cases, even college-age students have been foolish enough to turn in an assignment with netspeak. Talking to friends in this manner is one thing, but using this method in formal writing situations is deplorable. I can only imagine how one of these kids will write their college application personal statement -or their resume- when the time comes.

      A few years back I was in a drug store in Park City, Utah looking for nail clippers (don't ask). I couldn't find them so I looked for a store employee to help me out. I finally found someone in one of the aisles, but when I came closer I groaned inwardly when I realized that he looked Filipino. Since I could find no one else, I had no choice but to approach him.  Bracing myself for the inevitable, I asked him where I could find the nail clippers. He accompanied me to the correct aisle, then I thanked him and hoped he would go on his merry little way. But of course he didn't, and finally asked the question I had been dreading to hear:      "Where are you from?"   he asked me.  "California." I replied, hoping that would be enough. Of course it wasn't enough.    "No, where are you  really  from?"   he said.  "California." I repeated, this time a little more terse. He nodded and walked away, finally leaving me to buy my nail clippers in peace.  I'm a Filipina American. I was born in the Philippines, but I've spent most of my life in the United States. I don't deny that I'm a Filipina and am proud to be one, but I consider myself an American first and foremost. I have nothing against my fellow Filipinos. But what really annoys me is the false notion that just because I'm Filipino and I meet another Filipino, that suddenly we become best friends. I'm sorry, but I feel no special connection, no sense of "brotherhood/sisterhood" when I see other Filipinos. To me, they're just other people.  Why do many Filipinos have a strong need to ask such a question? Why does it matter so much where I'm from? If I had told the drugstore employee that I was born in the Philippines, how would he have responded? Would he just nod and leave me alone? I doubt it. Most likely he would have seen me as a kindred spirit and start talking to me in Tagalog. Maybe he might even ask how long I've lived in the US, or maybe more personal questions. I don't know.  What I do know is that it takes a lot more than sharing ethnicity to create a bond between people. I don't believe in the whole, "Well, we're both (Filipino/Jewish/black/Mexican/etc.), so we should watch out for each other. You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours." It was a coincidence that the drugstore employee and I were both Filipino, but that doesn't suddenly make me feel that I owe him anything, or vice versa. I don't feel that I suddenly deserve special favors from the guy now that I know we originated from the same country.  My mom feels the exact same way as me. She works for state disability, and one time she had a Filipina client on the phone. Now, this lady could speak perfect English and had no trouble understanding my mom. However, when she realized that my mom was Filipina, she insisted that my mom speak to her in Tagalog. My mom tried to avoid the issue, which really pissed off the woman, who later complained to my mom's superior. When the superior talked to my mom, she explained that she doesn't feel comfortable speaking in Tagalog to clients. Furthermore, my mom was worried that if she started speaking in Tagalog with this woman, the woman may try to get some special favors from my mom- after all, they're both Filipinos, right? Surely my mom could help her out? Perhaps give her a bigger disability check? Overlook certain things? I wouldn't put it past her. The superior (who was Japanese) nodded in agreement, adding that some Japanese clients have done the same.  My mom wasn't being a snob to this client. She speaks Tagalog to a lot of people- friends, relatives, and co-workers. However, she feels that speaking in Tagalog to a client is inappropriate. Why should she, when the other person clearly can speak English? She doesn't know these people- why should she feel so familiar and at home with them?  I thought that my mom and I were the only people who had problems with this issue when, at an applied social psychology symposium at my school, I found a research paper done by some Stanford University students that examined this phenomenon. The students had dubbed it "identity denial", and contend that many Asian Americans are often denied their American identity, espcially by those in their ingroup. This leads Asian Americans to assert their American identity through the demonstration of cultural knowledge. So in essence, they feel that they have to prove that they are truly American. I found this study very fascinating to read, not only because the Stanford students gave a term to the phenomenon I constantly encounter when I meet other Filipinos, but because it provides more scientific evidence and explanations on why this occurs. I wish I could put up the actual paper, but I haven't had the chance to contact the students to ask their permission.  In the meantime, if a Filipino comes up to me again and asks me the dreaded question, I'll continue to smile and say, "California."

      The other day my mom and I got into a spirited discussion on the importance and meaning of engagement rings. She was talking about a co-worker of hers, and we just drifted into this topic.   Here is my mom's take on this: If a man highly respects and truly loves his girlfriend, it's only natural that he will want to provide her with the best. A man who respects his girlfriend would not take her to crappy, scummy places when they go on a date; he would take her to nice, decent places. He will want to do nice things for her and give her presents. Therefore when the times comes for him to propose, he should get her the best engagement ring, no matter the cost. According to my mom, if he loves her, he will scrimp, save, and sacrifice to buy her the best, because she deserves it. He will work overtime. He will take out loans to pay for it. If a woman receives a cheap engagement ring from a man, she has every right to be upset and offended at the gesture because she deserves a very expensive ring.  Here's my take: I agree that a man who highly respects and loves his girlfriend should treat her right and want to give her only the best. He should feel that she only deserves the best. Yes, I agree that come proposal time, a woman deserves the best ring possible. Hell, I myself dream of getting a Tiffany ring someday. But where my mom and I disagree is that, whereas she believes that the guy should practically kill himself to prove his love, I on the other hand think that he should just try to get the best ring he can  comfortably afford.  I'd love a Tiffany ring, but I'd feel downright terrible if I found out that my boyfriend had to sell his car or be in debt for the next 10 years just to pay for it. At the same time though, this doesn't mean that I'm willing to accept something that practically came from a Cracker Jack box either. If the guy can afford getting a better ring for his girl without resorting to desperate measures, then by all means he should go get it for her! She deserves it.  We've all seen the DeBeers commercials with the silhouettes and are familiar with their slogan, "How else can 3 months' salary last forever?" 3 months' salary, huh? So that's the going price of love? I'd like to meet the sneaky marketing exec who created this standard for couples to follow. Does this mean then, that if a man bought a ring that only cost him 2 months' salary, that he doesn't really love his girlfriend very much? Does it mean that he only loves her 2/3 as much? What about guys who don't earn a lot? Do they then have to spend 5 months' salary?  Love is not measured by the size and cost of one's engagement ring. Take Ben and J-Lo. Yes, he bought her a beautiful $3 million diamond engagement ring. But where is the ring now? Does it still symbolize their love? No, it has become just another bauble in Ms. Lopez's (or shall I say, Mrs. Mark Anthony's) collection. Ben spent all that money for this ring and now it means nothing to either one of them. On the other hand, there are many women who are quite happy with their lives and their husbands/fiances, in spite of receiving a ring bought at the local mall. Some of their rings probably didn't cost $3000, let alone $3 million, yet it means the world to them.  An engagement ring is supposed to be a sign of the couple's intent to marry. It tells the world that this woman has found someone wonderful with whom to share her life; it's a symbol of a man's love and devotion for his woman. A powerful symbol, only to be surpassed by the wedding ring itself.  Unfortunately, money has a way of cheapening this symbol.

       urlLink      I suppose it’s not uncommon for foreigners to get hit on in Japan, especially the Caucasian ones. Some of my guy friends, including my own boyfriend, have been hit on by Japanese girls of different types and ages. However, my friend and fellow eikaiwa teacher had a slightly different experience.   One morning J was walking to work. Since he only lived one (train) stop away, on nice sunny days he would forgo his bike and walk to the office. He was cutting through the red light district area when he saw a rather tall, extremely ugly woman with very heavy makeup standing outside one of the buildings. It turned out that this was no woman at all, but a Filipino man dressed in drag, who works for the nightclub/bar “Mr. Ladys”  (yes, it's spelled that way).  As the name suggests, the club's hostesses happen to have XY chromosomes and have a penchant for wearing high heels. I am sorry to say that some of the “ladies” are indeed Filipinos. I’ve seen them myself.  Feel free to shudder now, because it’s going to get...a little weird.  Ever so friendly, J said hi to Mr. Lady. Although I don’t remember the exact conversation they had, I've recreated it as best as I can remember.  "Konnichiwa," said J.  Seeing that J wasn't Japanese, Mr. Lady answered in English. “Oh! Good morning!”  “How are you?” asked J.  “Not so good.”  “What’s wrong?” asked J. In hindsight it was a foolish move.  “Oh, I am very sad,” sighed the Lady.  “Why?”  “I am very sad,” said the Lady, “because no one wants to faack me.”  “Uh…huh.” said J, and started to walk away as quickly as possible.  "Why won't someone faaack me????" he/she wailed.  At this point J probably wished he had taken his bike instead.  “Hey…do YOU want to faack me? Ha?” she/he asked.  “Uhhh…no thanks.”      But Mr. Lady wasn't about to give up so easily.  “Oh come on! Faack me! Faack ME! Why don’t you want to faack me?" he/she cried out.  “Uhhhh….No, sorry. I’ve got to get to work now. Bye.” J said, as he broke into a trot and crossed the street to safety.  “NO! Come on! Faack me! Why won’t you faack me?”   I laughed my ass off when J told me this story. I forgot to ask him if he used the red light district as a shortcut again after that morning.

      When I was a little girl, my parents often took my brother and me to the movies (as they do to this day). We absolutely loved going to the movies, even though sometimes we didn't understand the plot. What we did understand though was that in the theatre, we had to abide by 3 rules:   1.) No talking during the movie 2.) Stay in your seat during the movie 3.) Cover your eyes during a love scene.  Note that rule #3 does not say "cover your eyes during a love scene and/or a violent scene". So it was perfectly ok for my brother and me to view the most violent, gory scenes. We watched all the Schwarzenegger and Stallone movies in their full, visceral glory. Ah-nuld mowing down 85 people at once with his Uzi? No big deal. Aliens ripping hapless space travelers in little bits? Sure. But once a scene cuts to a man and woman kissing, or when a woman’s tit comes into view, my parents' hands would suddenly fly in front of my face. They'd turn to me and with a stern look whisper, "Don't watch! This is bad for you!"  Can someone tell me why it's perfectly okay for a child to watch horrifyingly violent, psychologically scarring scenes on TV and in the movies, but a love scene is taboo? Yes, this question has been asked countless times in the past, but it remains unanswered. Consider the now infamous Janet Jackson/ Justin Timberlake “wardrobe malfunction” incident. Yes, she flashed her bare breast on TV. Yes, it was a cheap publicity stunt. Yes, it was totally unnecessary. However, the repercussions for that act were very strong: FCC investigations, more rigorous censoring of TV shows, and viewers angry that their innocent Sunday afternoon of watching grown men tackle and pummel each other to the ground has been defiled.  Why is sex and nudity so much worse than violence? Why is the American public so intolerant of it? Why were people so up in arms over Janet Jackson but have no problems with "CSI", a show that regularly shows detailed autopsies and recreations of victims' deaths? Why can you buy guns and bullets at Wal-Mart but not Playboys?  Sure, religion is one explanation. My parents are very Catholic, and in the eyes of the church, sex and anything related to it is eeeeeeviiiiiiillllllll. Thus, it was my parents' religious duty to shield their children from the carnal scenes on the big screen. However, as strong as the Catholic Church's stand is against sex, I don't hear them putting up as big a fight when it comes to onscreen violence. I haven't heard any stories in which Christians boycotted a movie because of the violence content. I may be wrong about this so I welcome anyone who can correct me.  In some places, sex is not an issue. I’ve seen European TV commercials that feature nudity, but the people there don’t seem to make a fuss about it. And on regular Japanese TV (not cable, mind you), some late night shows feature scantily clad girls, wearing very short skirts so you can see their underwear. I even saw a few programs that bordered on Skinemax- shows featuring bare breasts, for example. All this on regular television.     I know that certain love scenes can be too explicit (such as in  Monster's Ball )and I agree that very young children shouldn't be allowed to watch them. However, the exact same thing can be said for graphic violence. In fact, I think it's a lot worse for a child to watch violent scenes than sex scenes. Which do you think would be more traumatizing to a kid- watching someone get shot to death, or watching two people making out?  Just to be clear, I'm not saying that we should allow children to watch sex scenes instead of violent scenes. However, if parents let them watch someone die in pool of blood, why don't they let them watch two people making love? If parents truly feel they have to protect their children from "bad elements" in movies such as sex, then they should protect them from all bad elements, including violence, shouldn't they?  It might be a good idea for parents to expose their children to violence and sex gradually. If only they could stick closer to the MPAA ratings (G, PG, PG-13, etc) and take their children to movies that are truly appropriate for their age. In the meantime, they should teach their children about sex and violence, explaining why those kinds of scenes appear on TV or in movies on occasion. For example, they can teach children that sex is not a dirty thing but something that happens between two people who care for each other. They can't keep their children in the dark about either subject because they'll eventually find out from someplace else (usually from friends and classmates).  But if parents are unwilling or unable to do this, then perhaps they should just wait to take their kids to the movies until they're 13.

      Hi everyone,  Please bear with me for all the mistakes I've made so far in managing this blog. It's only been about 2 weeks since I created this blog, so I'm still quite a newbie to this whole thing.   Among the faux pas I've committed so far:  -I put a hit counter too late, and I still don't know how many hits I'm getting since I can't see the damn thing. -I accidentally deleted Haemi's comment (luckily I still had an email copy of it and reposted it). -For putting Trackback comments on Tinka and Haemi's comment when they should have been on mine. Honestly, I've looked at 3 different FAQs on Trackback, and I still get confused! Arrggghhh....  I'm usually a fast learner, but during the past week or so I've developed a series of brain farts. So please excuse this blog while the author's knowledge of the blog world is still under construction.

      ( apologies to non-Californians in advance...the following are a bunch of city names that are located relatively close to the beach.)   About a week ago my boyfriend and I spent a lot of time driving up and down Carson, Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach, and other surrounding areas because he recently accepted a new job in Carson and needs to find an apartment (he currently lives in Houston but flew to Cali this week for the interview). He wants to take up surfing again, so we tried to find areas that are relatively in between the beach and Carson.  As we drove around the surrounding cities, we found a mixture of old and new territories. One minute we'd see a wide, busy street with a Starbucks and McDonald's gleaming on the corner, the next we'd see a row of old, family owned, ethnic restaurants. The same can be said for houses. Some neighborhoods had small, older houses while other neighborhoods contained brand spanking new, cookie cutter residences.   My boyfriend mentioned that he had missed his old house in Santa Monica because in spite of its age (I believe it was built in the 70s') it had a lot of character. He also mentioned that he liked streets that had older businesses and establishments because he felt it added character to the neighborhood, and added that he preferred such places to commercialized businesses like Starbucks et al.  While I agreed with my boyfriend in the idea of the importance of character in a house and a city, I am more partial to newness in general. For example, I prefer to live in a nice, brand new house. I guess my feeling is that, if I were to pay a whole lot of money for a house, I want to make sure I'm getting my money's worth. I'd want something brand new, that no one has lived in before me. I wouldn't have to worry about it falling apart, having to make unnecessary repairs.  Many people are aware how expensive it is to live in L.A., especially parts of West LA like Santa Monica. A 30 year old 3 bedroom, 1 story house can cost millions of dollars, simply because it's located in Santa Monica, while a similar 5 year old house located further east in California. While I can understand that such a house is charming and can have a lot of "character", there's no way on earth I'd pay that much money for a house, while I can buy a bigger, newer house for less if I chose to live more inland.  That's what my parents did. About 7 years ago they bought a brand new house in a small town in San Bernardino County for a very good, low price. It's nice and large and comfortably fits a family of 6. At the time it was still a thriving, developing town. There was no supermarket, very few restaurants, not even a post office or high school. We felt like pioneers settling on new territory when we first moved in, for we were one of the few houses around. I still remember having a view of the city from my bedroom window- until a house built next to us obliterated that view forever.  Granted, there are of course, downsides to living in a nice, new environment. We live waaaaaaaaaaaaay out here in the Inland Empire, removed from the beach, museums, and other fun activities. Also, I understand that a lot of newer houses tend to look alike, devoid of any character. Our house is part of tract housing, so despite the fact that my parents were able to select what color paint and kind of roof they wanted, in general our house looks like many other houses in our neighborhood.  Ideally, I’d like to live in a town and home that contains the best of both worlds: old enough to maintain its charm and cultural character, but also elements of newness to satisfy your daily needs. In terms of Southern California, the good news is that many beach towns and older communities have this sort of mix. Santa Monica is a good example. The bad news is that, the farther you live from West LA and more towards the Inland Empire, you see this mix of old and new less and less. I guess it's up to the person to decide what his or her priorities are.

      One day during Golden Week (a week long holiday in May in Japan) a few years ago, some friends -two British and two American- and I went to Fujikyu Highland, an amusement park near Mount Fuji. To get there, we took a shuttle bus.   On our way home we took the last two rows near the back of the bus. Since the seats are two to a row, one of our friends had to sit in the very back where the left and right sides or the rows meet. Therefore, she had to sit next to a stranger. This particular friend happens to be a British Indian woman. As people piled in the bus, two teenage girls made their way over the two available seat next to my friend. They seemed to argue for a few seconds until one of them finally took the seat right next to my friend while the other sat girl a little further away.  What were they arguing about, you ask? I didn't hear the whole conversation since I was sitting a few rows down, but my ears did pick up two words:  gaijin,  and  kowai.  Foreigner. Scary. According to one of my other friends, one of the girls was hesistant to sit next to my friend, while the other chastised her for being a scardy cat. Not wanting to argue any further, the bolder girl agreed to act as a buffer between my friend and the first girl.  Let me point out that my British Indian friend speaks and understands Japanese perfectly, and heard every word that these two girls had said about her. However, being no stranger to this kind of prejudice against foreigners, she simply ignored the girls.  I find it interesting that with the number of non-Japanese living in Japan, some people are still genuinely afraid of them. I had assumed that if there are Japanese who are wary of foreigners, they would be people not as exposed to foreigners such as older people, or people who live in rural areas. I didn't consider that two teenage girls, supposedly highly exposed to Western culture, would harbor the old stereotypes about foreigners. Why were they scared of my friend? Is it because of her appearance? She isn't scary looking in the least. She may be a little tall (about 5'7"), but she doesn't look manly or threatening. She wasn't being loud and obnoxious on the bus either- she was just keeping to herself.  Perhaps it does have something to do with looks. Maybe one reason these two girls felt uncomfortable about my friend was because she was a different type of  gaijin,  one they were unaccustomed in seeing. My friend is not blonde and blue-eyed, with fair skin. She has jet black hair and tan skin. If my friend had fit the stereotypical description of a  gaijin,  would the girls have felt more comfortable sitting next to her?  However, sometimes even the so-called "typical gaijin" evoke surprise and alarm in Japanese. An American friend of mine -light skinned, light brown hair, hazel eyes- was on the train one time when the child in front of him suddenly screamed, "Ah! Gaijin da!" ( It's a foreigner! ) My friend, who speaks and understands Japanese and has a great sense of humor, looked around in mock alarm and exclaimed, "Eh? Honto? Doko? Doko?" ( Huh? Really? Where? Where? )  While it's evident that the popularity of Western culture and the presence of Westerners in Japan has led the Japanese to be a little more accepting, open, and tolerant of them, incidents like the ones I just described show that they still have a long way to go.  Has anyone else experienced something similar to what my friends have experienced? Share your story.
