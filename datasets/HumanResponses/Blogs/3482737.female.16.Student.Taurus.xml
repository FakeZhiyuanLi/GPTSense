      my parents being divorced is so hard. i have to go do this with one of them and go do this whith the other. truthfully i dont think that they could go three days together with out fighting. i cant say the birthday card thing because i get to diffrent cards. i live with my dad. i love that. but i have to go and see my mom every other weekend. if i miss a weekend then she gets mad so i cant make plans with anyone because i dont want her to get upset with me. my dad is usally on the road because he drives a semi. when he is home im thankfull for that because he spends time with me. he is really cool even though he dose have his bonderys. i can only stay out till 10 on weekends and 9 during school days. no later or elese i am grounded. my mom is cool too she is a nurse. that mean no periceing other than your ears because if they get infected that is bad. what i want is for my nose to get peirced. that would be ausem. but nether of my parents would go for that. i no that my dad wouldnt take me to get it becuase my mom would say no. he cares about what my mom thinks even though he dosnt show it very ofter if he didnt i would probly already have myt tounge peirced. my mom lives in a diffrent town. it is 2 hours away. she has a boyfriend who one of these days he will be my step-dad if they ever set a date. they are ingaged. he has 3 kids a son who is my age. but he lives in a diffrent state we dont get to see him alot. i like him in all but he thinks that he knows how to do everything. i think that he has this problem with girls beeing able to do things besides cooking and cleaning. then there is his daughters who now live in the same town as they do the oldest one is 14 she thinks she is better than everyone eles. shes not she like her mother. a big word that i shouldnt say then the youngest one who is 11 she is 11 that should explain everything. my mom has 3 girls me. my sister who is 21 she is living with her contol freak friend. her freind controls her life i think. she works a toys-r-us. she is going through college corsus. that is good. now she can get a better job when she is done. my younger sister is 14 everyone takes her as a priss. she's not a priss she is strong just because she likes to look nice and has lots of friends dose not make her a priss. she is realy sweet and we fight yes but i still love her. my dad is re-married and she has a son well he likes to hunt and fish. i guesse that you could call him a hick but he is 17 and got his girlfriend pregnat. what the luck. my dad also has a child with a nother woman she is 11 now i belive. they live in lousiana so i dont get to see her much. they are suppose to be coming up this month. that is my family exept for my 21 year old sisters ex-boyfriend i coulnt him as a brother because i know that if i need anything he would be there for me in a heart beat. that is why i love him. he is 22 i think or 23 but he has a slite drinking problem. but everyone has there bads. thats about like my faimly image how many fights there are in the summer when there are 6 kids in a house. 2 bathrooms 1 computer that everyone fights over. i dont know how our parents do it realy i dont. well one day i hope to have kids of my own. but untill then i have to learn from my 3 brothers and 5 sister. wow than is 8. luckly they didnt all come from the same people. do to the goverment 1 son and 3 daughters must be evacuated from this house. how many do you think would jump to the oppertunity. well thats my family hecktic but loved

      it suxs that if i dont go to ummer school that i dont pass me sophmore year. but i suppose that next year i will have to crack down. nothing but school. my new favorite two songs are me and emily and straight taquila night. they are country songs. i went to the hospital on friday night. there is something wrong with my overys. that suxs because now i get pains in my stomach. and i was thinking the other day what if this affects me being able to have children. what if i cant have kids that would be bad beacsue i want to have a little family when i get old enough to like aroung 21 i would like to be married and then aroung 22 or 23 have kids but if i can that would shatter all of my dreams. everytime i think about kids it gose back to kenny and kolbi. she makes me jeouls i dont know why but she dose. it like our hole life she has always gotten everthing that she wanted and she wanted a baby and she is getting one now. but she thinks that her life is hell. but no one in her family is bitching that she is pregnet well her dad is and her mom is dissapointed in her but that is to be exspected. when we were little i alwayed wished that i could have her life. she has little sisters and a brother that would do anything for her. she dosnt see the good side to everything. she only looks apon the bad. i hate that she dose that. i wake up each morning and think about all of the new and good exsperiances that i could have. she wakes up and thinks what could go wrong now. but she dosent see the little things in life. i wish that she would wake up and see reality. but like that is going to happen anything soon. all of the dreams that she had now about moving away and being something big ain life are all down hill she cant do them.me i still have a chance to make my life possible. that is all i gat for now.

      today i woke up around 9 brushed my teeth and went back to bed. at noon william and kenny came home and woke me up they went to work today suprise they both need to find jobs that will pay for their expences. i have been working on getting a job. i have applied everywhere. it seems like no one wants to hire me i have applied to at least 15 places no one has even called. my 14 year old sister is getting a job already. at culvers in bloomington. it suxs that she can get a job and i cant. then agin she had jim help her by talking to the maneger. but whatever gets you a job. i need to get a hold of mr walter. and see if he has any work for me to do so that i can earn some money. until i get a steady job. im thinking about going to asgro and ask if i can do bean walking. crapyest job in the world but it is good pay. i need a job if anyone can help me please do so. yup i think that i am going to call mr walter hear soon so that i can get some money during the summer he ussaly has painting and yard work. becasue he lives on a farm there is a lot of work that needs to be done. i need my mom to call me so i can call my friend in bloomington back so that i can tell him that i can go to florida with him that would be the trip of a lifetime. i just need to get out of illinios. this state is so plane. or even out of the house would be fun at the moment. i need to get a camera with film so that i get back on my piture spree. william and kenny are so natural when they do things. like fishing  and hunting they are so fun to take pitcures of becasue they ignore that i am there and they act so smooth. the most funnest boys to take pitchures of then i have my friends that are girls that i want serous pithures of. i like art people will learn who i am by my art. g2g shave.

      it seems like everyday of my life keeps getting better and better. ya know i couldnt ask for anything more. people dont see the good things in life. sometimes i think that i have gone crazy because i get these visions like things. until my mom comfronted me about it she told me that she got them too and so did my grama goldie i suppose that it is something that i should not take for granted. i should think about what they mean and try to help with it. its hard because i dont want to tell anyone because they might think that i am crazy. i dont understand why i get these sometimes i wish that i didnt because they hurt to know what is going to happen. like i have had this one that my papa only has 1 1/2 of something i dont know if it means days, years, months. i wish i never got that one but i guesse that it is telling me that i should go and see him. i usally try to live every day as if it were my last so that i know that when it is my turn to go i wont me sad about not getting anything accomplished in life i like to walk so that i can think about what i need to do that is what i figure i will do know so that i can clear my head about all of these things
