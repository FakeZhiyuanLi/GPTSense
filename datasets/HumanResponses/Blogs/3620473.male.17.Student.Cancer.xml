      HOW ON EARTH DID I EVER DATE HER AND WHAT A FUCKING LYING WHORE BAG BITCH WHO IS SO FUCKING RUDE.  ugh.  I went to the oaks for the midnite movie, the manchurian candidate. It was a good movie, but diana was there. WTF?! and her and curry talked thru the entire thing, and im sorrie, but talking like you are at your house and carrying on a full conversation is fucking rude. It pissed me off royal. Specially how days before she told me she never comes down and hangs out around here. Will Smith had a good way of putting it in I, Robot. He used the whole he sneezed thing and the guy who was talkin looked at him funny. Then he apologized, said it was simply that he was alergic to bullshit, haha!  Alright, its almost 3 in the morning, damn, 9 there. But hey! It is the 25th! You get home the 28th! yay! *mwah*  gnite, or gmorning, whatever the fuck it is. I love you.

      good days come in pairs.  I really have been in the best mood ever for not much more of a reason than getting to talk to you. Like I said, was just something about it and hearing you say it will all be alright and such, guess it was just what I needed to hear. I just cant stop thinking about how great you are and how much I miss you. I'm not worrying about a damned thing any more, other than the little time that you will still be apart from me and here. But that will end soon. Its been the first of the last days without you. After today, there is not another saturday without you. The next one you will be here :) I'm borderline giddy excited I am in such a good mood. God I love you. *MWAH* Oh and about that, I don't want a makeout session whenever you get back, hell I could go without a single kiss. Just as long as I get to see you and maybe one lil hug, I will be more than fine. So don't you go worrying about that or anything else. Like you said to me, just be you, cause thats the person I love, you.  *mwah*

      I dunno how much of the posts below this you will want to read cause of our convo today. Something about it just put me in the best mood. And I figured out how to phrase what I wanted to say. I don't want to ignore the fact you went to hungary when you get back, I want to learn and know what happened because thats what I would do if your here. I love you and want nothing more than to be with you. Basically, we have a lot of catching up to do :) in a very good way.  and hey :-P not to sound rude, but your time hasnt been that much worse cause ur there. I had my fair share of hard times and rough spots as well :-P hehe. All I know, is that no matter how hard one side or the other has been, I have been there for you (I hope) and you have been there for me. Its hard to "just talk" if something is suddenly going wrong, but as much as possible its been good. I just wanna say thanks for everything. You didnt have to call me as much as you did and you coulda easily gone off and had a wild time, in many of those ways.. lol. You are wonderful, and I could not ask, imagine, or even dream of a better girl, friend, as well as girlfriend than you.  I'm off to see like three movies tonite, or maybe just two, or something. Don't worry, I am saving the notebook or arthur or whatever you want to see for you time, hehe.   Be Happy (somewhere deep inside) *mwah*

      Alright, I dunno if today was any better, but if not, here you go.  Just close your eyes (and read this at the same time! hehe) and think about this. There was a day way back in may, oh soo long ago ;). You were bored, and we were in our talking phase. You told me to come up, and I of course wanted to so I did. When I got there, we had our fun little LOTR trivia dealio, cause we are both dorks like that, but I love it. Then we went for a walk in dark hollow. Just a nice simple, fun, walk. The world faded away behind us, and it was just you and me. You found out I was nervous about you, and I still am just fyi, but that also meant I could open up to you. Then on the way home built up my courage and got to hold your hand. Such a lil accomplishment in todays sex minded world, but it meant a lot to me. And they lived happily ever after is the ending to that lil part. Cause it is is true, been happy ever after that, and I hope you have been too, deep down inside, where it counts. I know there has been a lot of shit going on, but I hope on top of everything, where it really counts, you are still happy. Thats what matters :-*  Now for part two of this. I dunno how much I will be able to talk to you till u get home, so I wanna explain this here so I can save those minutes that cost you so much. I was talking to Heidi today about how nervous I am that your coming home. I want you home, yeah, but I love being with you and don't want to screw it up. I really have put so much "into" this month, and I just don't want things to fall apart once your home. So I am asking you to do me a favor. If I get too "in your face" or overbearing or pushy or anything, just tell me to back off. I know you are going to need some space once you get home, and I am not the only person in your life and there are plenty of other people you are going to want to see. So just tell me if I am getting annoying before it makes you or me snap or anything. On the same token, I don't wanna distance myself or anything too. I know this all sounds weird, but me and heidi decided it made sense, so there, lol. I'm just not used to actually having you be here when I want to be with you, so things are going to be odd. But y'know what, that is us, i dunno what we would do if things were normal.  Now I am sorry there is so much to read on here. It is all weird since its out of order too, but oh well. I hope the rest of your trip is as good as possible. Hope the pool went well and no one freaked out or got mad. I smashed my hand today and my finger is swollen and my back is all sore, so it was a good day, nothing too bad ;) hehe. I love you.

      so tonite I went to vals, which was fun but still kinda weird. wasnt the usual crowd, so yeah. Had a good time though. Hehe, I have showed you off though. People were going through hot actresses and such, which was weird for the crowd, and I said no, the hot ones are all in modeling, like my gf, hehehe. I wasn't joking either :-*  and damnit, I miss you. Good morning btw, if you are reading this at all close to "now." Its officially the 24th here, you know what that means :) One less day until I can see you. Oh yeah, and tell christen happy late birthday as well.  I now have two more things to say, kinda rant-ish.  First off, don;t freak out if things aren't back to normal the minute u get off that plane. Nothing has changed I know, but like, its going to be weird, for both of us. I dunno, I just wanted to make sure you dont get like pissed at me if i act like an idiot. To be honest, I am not used to having your presence grace me really, lol. Its been a while. I probably sound silly, or am worrying you, so just, dont worry. Awkward, thats how things will be, and I hope you know what I mean by that, and its in the good way, not the bad one. The "overly giddy and excited and happy yet still trying to get un stressed out" awkward. *shrugs*  Secondly, the word love cannot express how I feel about you. There is just something so great with you, something I have never felt before. This is going to sound weird as hell, but I have half said it before. I miss YOU. I don't miss fooling around with you, I don't miss having you here able to "show you off" as some people I know do. I miss just plain you. I feel like and idiot for dating diana, and for ever saying certain things to her. Because what I feel right now, even with you so damned far away, is so damned strong. There is not a thing I would change about you, and you are beyond my dreams. I never thought I could be with someone as wonderful as you. I honestly thought diana was the best I could do at the time, half the reason I stayed with her. And I want to say something else, and dont feel bad at ALL. After her, I wasn't planning on dating at all here at riverview. My dream was to run off and get as far away from here as possible. Find people that would understand and like the real me and not make me show off just to have friends let alone more. As much as I goof off, I am incredibly self conscious, very shy, and have the crappiest self esteem ever. I dont admit that a lot, but its part of this. I just wanted to say I changed all that, and I changed it for you. I could have easily said I wasn't interested, although I never thought I really had a chance. But you are too good, just too damned special and perfect. And I am glad. I don't know if I am coming off as arrogant or rude, because I in no way mean to. I am just trying to explain how much you mean to me, because just one, two, or more words cannot describe. I love you Michelle, I do I do I do. Someday I may repeat that after a different set of words too. Time can only tell, but the future looks bright. "What can you see, on the horizon?" To which I answer, the brightest thing of all, you. *mwah*

      Read the post below this before this one.  I am in a much better mood now, cause I sat down and thought a bit more.  I think what is making the us stuff even harder is the weird way it happened. We had only been "dating" for a month when you left. Hell only really talking for about another month before that. So two months then your gone a month. Now keep reading cause I know bad stuff is going through your head, hear me out. We didn't have very long to get to know one another, and so i think there are lots of bumps when we can talk for every now and then. I don't expect to hear from you everyday, every other day, hell even once a week i doubted when u left. When you left I just wanted you to go and have a great time, and I would be there to support you every step of the way. What its come down to now is stress and the distance and all that stuff, its just getting rough. I just kinda am starting to break down out of my supportive role and then feel horrible cause im not helping, thats all. Anyhow, back to the only two months thing. It could have been so easy to just wait until after you came back, like you thought about. Or to not want to stay as we are while you were gone, or so many other ways of giving up. Hell even at this point, you could be going off with guys and having a wild time, or we could be at each others throats in anger and such. All I know is that when you left, I thought to myself this is going to make or break us. Nothing has been broken so far :-* Its been hard as hell, I know, and it still isn't over and the last few days are just going to make it that much harder. But think about it, its been 24 days now that you have been gone. That is 3 and a half weeks after only talking to each other for 8 weeks. I thought it was definitely a good thing, and just goes to show that things great are to come. I love you, and I feel you return it, even though you are not here. Things have and will be rough the next few days, but you and I will come out on top, together, and stronger. I love you and am never letting go.  Also, please don't worry about calling me. If you are having a crappy day, I would be more than happy to help. But if you call just for my sake, don't. I don't wanna make that bill bigger than I already have. The only time I really want to talk to you before you leave is right then, right before you do leave, thats all. I also have to admit it just gets damned hard to say goodbye on the phone, so yeah thats the other part of that. Anyhow, I am rambling.   I love you, I hope the mail helped, even if you did have a crappy day and said it didn't and that you weren't feeling better. Like ive said, you're a horrible liar ;). That is all for now. I know youve prolly had an emotional rollercoaster with this and the previous post, sorrie, just had to spill a bit. Feel free to return the favour if you can, if not, no worries.  OMG, funny porn story just happened too. This will sound very, very ironic, but I found a band named budapest while you were gone. I wasn't hunting the name out, I was just clicking through random things online and listening. When I heard them I wanted more and so I have been downloading more songs by them. Well I was doing that when you called and so got up and left. I came back and on the screen there were all the search results, with hundreds of "hot hungarian budapest love slaves" and what not, lmao. Well my mum saw it and was all like wtf, and i had to explain, in between my laughter. Hope you at least got a giggle out of it, my hungarian love slave ;) can't wait for *that* porn ;) lol  So there, end on a happy note. I love you dearly michelle, more than anything else. *mwah*

      I just got off the phone with you but I still have something to say, specially the way the call ended.  I just haven't been doing well cause i honestly came to the realization that I have no idea what is going on, and for like a month now I barely have known you. I guess it just sucks cause ive sent you so many emails and posted so much in the blog, but i still feel so alone. I just kinda snapped after seeing you online and the entire basis of the convo was me doing stuff for you. And no, I am not mad or upset with you, just upset in general. I just want things back like they were and I want you here and I just, I dunno. Me and jackie were talking about how its bad when you get used to being alone, even though you are dating someone.  I just love you and want to be with you, thats the bottom line. I guess the month has made me afraid of things changing, and I can tell somethings have. Nothing bad, no, but I just, worry. But I worry cause I care and I love.  So I am off to listen to some music, hope you are sleeping well and hope your days get better. You can get through this, and you are not alone.  *mwah*

      sorrie i dissapeared. I went to put an away message up and it broke. By the time I got back online, you were gone and chris was on my case about leaving. I hope things are going better, whatever all they are. By the time you read this, and they way you count, only 4 more days, so something to smile about eh?  I went with chris out to cranberry so he could get an ipod. Was fun but didnt get anything out of him, other than how he enjoyed doing 90-95 on the turnpike. He is an asshole as a driver, as usual, but i feel ten times safer than with curry. Curry is going to be the death of me, and yes you are allowed to worry aboot that, cause i do too, lol. Just jokin, giggle giggle?  I might be going to ohio tomorrow night for the weekend, but am unsure right now. I am leaning towards no, cause its a long ass car drive to just go see a bunch of smokers and almost die.  oh yeah, i forgot to ask if you read/liked the last item in the mail that hasnt gotten there. I didn't know if it was a good idea or just corny and me being weird. *shrugs*  I was supposed to go to ultimate tonite, but the mummy acted a bit annoyed with me and so i am getting those brownie points for staying home. I need all that I can get so I can spend as much time with you as I can, or as much as you will put up with me. ;)  Well, that is all for me, prolly gonna watch a movie or two then hit the sack early. I loves yous muchs. *snuggles*

      first off, if you are reading this before you go and it is the 22nd, good morning! if not, well, um hi!  I love you. That is the bottom line. I love you. You are 4628 miles away. I love you. You have been gone 22 days. I love you. You have had ups and downs. I love you. You will be here in 6 days. I love you. We have many more months ahead, only they will be together. I love you.  Get the hint?  good! *mwah*  I can't see the future, lots of things change, I will admit to that. But however that future goes, I want it to be with you. I want us to both to enjoy the ride, cause yknow, im a bmw, the ultimate driving machine ;) (i know it was corny, but it made you giggle! so ha!)  oo and guess what, i think i found something out about chris and the heidi situation. No one had heard from mia in well over a month, including him. I think this is what maybe triggered interest in heidi. Turns out mia got hit by a car and was in a coma for 2 weeks. She wakes up and either calls or somehow talks to chris recently, and so yeah, think that had a part of it. or not, might all be imagination.  but anyhow, I just want to be with you. and that want is so great, nothing is going to get in the way. the love so strong that nothing can break it. you are going to get home safely, nothing is going to go wrong, and i will be able to hug you once more, kiss those wonderful lips of yours, and gaze into your gorgeous eyes.   I kinda want to spill something here too. The last two girls I got interested in both burnt me, and burnt me bad. I just wanted to say that you are wonderful, absolutely perfect in my mind, and that I trust you more than anything, and that my heart mind and life are just as much a part of you as they are me. I'm just saying that it isnt easy to get that out of me, but you more than deserve it, and you meant that much to me. I love you and want to be with you. I don't want you as a status symbol, I want you as my best friend. I don't want you just to fool around with, I want you to be around. You make think of yourself as, hell, i dont remember that long list of adjective you used that one day, but I have just one for you; perfect. I can't think of anything I don't like. I love you michelle, thru and thru. goodnite *mwah*

      well, today is the day. it marks three weeks that you havent been here, but it also makrs just one week till i can be with you once more. I look forward to that day greatly, and I miss you so very much. Make the most of your days there, please do. Enjoy everything you can, as hard as that may be. I want nothing more than for you to be happy. I love you much, and it hurts when I know you are in pain. Today was a bit more productive, well at least more relaxing. I slept in a good bit, almost till 11, which is a freaking record for me, as you know. Then I had to do more yardwork, yay dad being gay. Then I got all clean from taht and did work on the computer scanning in more picatures and whatnot. Then I took some me time, almost finishing off my room. I also doodled and drew for a bit. I drew us, but it didn't come out incredibly well. Then again nothing but the real thing does your beauty any justice. You are a gift to whomever eyes may gaze upon you. I got to talk to you too, which rocked, although I am sorry once more for the bill. I will help pay it, if I ever get in the positive with my money once more. Then the diana bitching came, and it went well, but I need to ask you a favour. You can't kill her, you can't bitch at her, and you pretty much can't talk to her, ever or at all. I promise if that happens though, you will probably never hear from her again. I cut off everything today, deleting her from my buddylists and phone, and getting rid of the last of diana things. except for what other people say about her, she is gone. That is how the convo ended, and hopefully she will be leaving other people alone as well, as long as they leave her alone too, which is why I ask it of you to please not go to her and do anything. if you want to talk to me aboot her, i will gladly do that, just keep things quiet with her. hopefully this is all for the best. now if you read this again tonite, get some rest and dream sweet dreams. I am yours to come home to, no one else gets me. I love you greatly, and am in no way leaving you. Remember that when you sleep *mwah* I know I do :)  Beneroo

      well, today was rather dull.  woke up to find out the power had gone out, which sucked for geek purposes. I had some chores to do outside anyhow though, so I just kinda got those done. I also got more of my room back in, my room. lol. I think you will definitely like the new layout, pretty suave ;) lol.  the power finally came back on and i enjoyed being able to listen to music once more. I got some work work done scanning some pictures and such, but other than that was really bored. took a nap, and when I woke up, i coulda sworn you were there, was the weirdest feeling, but in a good way :)  this evening planning on going to visit andy at work once more, then maybe hang out with heidi and tessa again after that. i really wanna play a game of risk too, but im just a geek and no one else here wants to, lol.  so um, yeah, that has been my uneventful crap day, hopefully yours at the waterpark, er, aquapark, went better (i think that is where you are/were today). My love for you is greater than the skies at night and deeper than the depths of the sea, and there is nothing that I want more, than to have you once more next to me. And yes I came up with that all by myself *snuggles*  *mwah*

      well today was a long day  i had to wake up early to go to drums. except i was being serious when i talked to u. i was going to go get food, but i had this strange as hell feeling and stayed at the computer, half waiting for you. trust me it was weird when u got online.  drums sucked, but went better than I expected them to go. oh well, next week its a half hour shorter, so that is kinda good.  then I had to mow next door and deliver some packages, which just took time, but it helps pay the bills, haha. theeeeeeeeeen I rearranged my room some more, now that the floor is completely done. I think I am going to build an easel tomorrow for my drawing abilities.  Then the best part of my day came. I got to talk to you, and tell you most of what you just read. but above all i got to hear you once more. you are so wonderful, i just cant say that enough. im almost to the point of counting the hours until you are back, but not quite yet ;) oh god i just, i love you so damned much. just, thank you. *hugnsmooch*  then tonite we went mini golfing, me tessa curry heidi chris and carlos. it was fun, but chris seemed to be being a bitch to heidi, so that wasnt cool, but ill check into that later, maybe just uber joking.  remind me to tell u something slightly funny. it involves how a first for you was also a first for me, basically.  and now, time for bed, i am dead tired, and i miss you, so sleeping will fix both.  gnite  *mwah*

      well today sucked cause ive had a sever case of miss-michelle-itis all day. I just, yeah, miss you. A lot. I just want you in my arms and know everything is alright. I know this is going to all sound silly of me, but I don't want things to change. I don't want to have you come back and like hate me, or some other difference. I guess I am just paranoid or something, but its been going thru my head all day. All the people fooling around has me worried too a bit I guess. I know I shouldn't, but I do worry. I hope that isn't evil of me? I mean christen I thought was all like dedicated to derek and whatnot, and kevin is going off and having fun, and you have some un named guy hitting on you heavily and such. I'm sorry, I just jealous easy *sigh* I just don't want to lose you, that is what it comes down to. I love you and love having that returned, and i would never want that to change. You are wonderful michelle. see you in my dreams, where I will be alone no longer. *mwah*

      its over. tonite is the last nite i sleep with you 4600 miles away. its the last time i wont be able to say goodnite at the same time. but it wont be the last nite i dream of you.  today was a good day, ive been giddy from the though of you the entire time. i cant freaking wait. i will prolly explain this day, as well as tons of others tomorrow, but here is what went on.  woke up and talked to u not long after, which sorted a good bit out, which im glad. i think that was the most upset we got with each other the entire time, and it was for no more than like 10 minutes, so id say that went alright. hell prolly woulda happened even if u were here. the end result would be the same though, i love you so damn much.  the rest of the day was un eventful. I had a UPS damage problem, so a guy is pissed at me, i had to ship some other stuff, i sold some other stuff, i scanned some pictures, i took a shower and damn those shower heads work wonders, neck and back feel much better. u really need to try it to understand.... nothing O:-)  went to seans in the lat afternoon. helped make dinner there then played a game of life. i almost won without going to college, hooray! lol then we went bowling, and i forgot how much fun that can be. then again i was just in a damned good mood. i was de-stressing, like i told me to, and damn u had a big part in that.  but yeah, im going to bed now, cause when I wake up, it will be that much closer to time to see you. and with that, i pronounce this chapter of the blog done. It will stay here as long as it can, but i doubt i will continue posting, as I now have the real wonderful you once more. I love you michelle, I do, I do. *mwah*

      not, good, day.  today has sucked in just about every way possible.  I had a really really bad dream last nite. I know its not true, but it involved you and yeah, just sucked.  I also had to be up at 7 to go to the drum practice shit, so that didnt help either. then i came home and had to go cash money so i can pay my dad the $425 I owe him, great. THEN i had to do some real work cause apparently these pictures have to go back soon, so i scanned like 200 of those, which sucked. Then i had to do my summer reading, but that i cant complain about. that I am doing so I can spend more time with you. :) And I dunno, saw i robot today, cause i was that bored. and i kinda was hoping to hear from you, not like i expected it, would just help after last nites dream..... so yeah. But dont you dare feel bad cause i already feel bad for how big that fone bill is. Just, if you can, and ill pay for it all, i just want to talk to u once more before u leave for... here. *shrugs* im sillie. ive also been sick all day, tho trying to cover it up as much as possible. sorta half threw up last nite, but i think i know why now. at first i thot it was cause i had too much apple juice, but ive figured out its cause i ate 2 week old chips. cause i ate them again today and feel more sick now, blah. im an idiot. so in general, i feel like shit. hope your having a great time with your lesbians and dallas and all that, great big orgy ;) whatever, i can see you soon enough, so *shrugs* bye love *mwah*

      well today was a kinda long day, but oh well.  I woke up to my dad being in florida and my mum and bro still in ohio, was kinda weird, but oh well.  I did some summer reading work and I also scanned a lot of pictures, so that was productive. But then I got bored and had to find something to do so I eventually went to seans. Curry of course came along, and man is she getting annoying. I need a serious break from her, and much more time with you, or I am going to go crazy. I got to see steve and sean though, so that was cool. I still have yet to see the jodi though, too busy with steve, ugh. I have nothing wrong with missing someone, I understand that completely, but they have done nothing but blown everyone else off for like 4 days now. Blah.   You know what is cool though? By the time you read this you only have one full day and a good bit of traveling and then your here. I am coming out to the airport with ur mum now instead of alex, figured it would be easier and might make some inroads. I also felt bad going with alex as his car was near full and it was just kinda awkward. Oh well.  Well I have to get up early tomorrow, so I am off to bed, early for once. Have to make up for staying up till three this morning too. Plus, the best part is I get to see you again :) Love you much, *mwah*

      http://homepage.mac.com/oatmeal/MAF/maxes/java-cheers.gif  want some? ;)  Alright, adding to this post instead of making yet a new one.  All i have to say is I love my dad. He is in florida this week, but he just called saying he got there. He was all like "make sure to welcome home michelle for me, spends lots of time with her, we should throw a party or something." I dunno, the key line in there was spend lots of time with her. So I have half my family's permission now, hehe. All I can say is it is only 71 more hours, but who is counting? ;)  *mwah*
