       Before School:   Well, I woke up this morning and I had bacon.  For those of you who don't know me, bacon is the shit.  I like is greasy and chewy, but not too dry or hard.  I love my bacon.  It is quite amazing.  My book bag also cheered me up.  You see, there is nothing in it due to the lack of school days that is slowly creeping up upon us.  It was a good thing it was almost empty because Shane had previously locked it to a desk and I had to cut a strap off to free it.  As I am still a little sore from previous events, whether they are physical or emotional, I played my depressing music to get me motivated for the day.  Let's just say it helps to calm me down and make me my sweet and sexy self.  Finally, I made it to my bus stop.  This cheered me up significantly because Lomas was dressed like an Amish person.  It was quite amazing.  He had everything from tight pants to the straw hat.  He's a pretty cool guy.  Chemistry:   Chemistry was surprisingly fun today.  That was probably because it was the last day though, except for my final tomorrow (yikes!).  We got to do a crossword puzzle which was fun because it had a clue and you had to match it to the person in the class.  I didn't finish it, but I was amused to say the least.  The only other entertainment that I had was cutting the rest of my book bag strap off and using it for a whip.  It was cynical yet slightly pathetic at the same time.  Gym:   Gym depressed me.  We had to get dressed, but it was the last day.  Give us a break for Gods sake!  We did have one option however.  We could either play kickball or walk the track.  What went through my mind was this: I'm damn lazy and I'm to screwed up to be active right now so I'm going to be a lazy bastard and walk in circles, but first I'll climb a tree.  The tree climb was amazing, but I scraped my arms so it looks like I'm a cutter.  Oh well.  Walking the track turned out to be fun though.  I hung out with Boon and we made fun of people.  We even picked up a piece of wood and made people limbo so that we could be entertained.  Then Boon got tired of walking and went to play kickball.  That bastard.  I will get him.  Then he came back to me, they always come back.  After forty-five minutes, I was allowed to go inside.  That's when the horror came.  I had to clean out my wrestling stuff, Bill's wrestling stuff and my gym stuff.  Let me tell you something about my gym stuff.  I don’t wash my clothes.  I bring in new clothes to replace the old so I had accumulated quite a bit of smelly clothes.  I finally got everything packed up into my book bag (previously empty), my wrestling bag and Bill's wrestling bag.  It weighted me down considerably.  As I tried to escape the wrestling room, my coach caught me and weighted me in.  I'm surprised he didn't hurt me since I gained ten pounds since the season ended.  Oh I'm sorry, wrestling season is never over.  Java:   Java was boring today.  All I did was read out serial numbers so that Daub could take inventory.  It truly sucked.  I am pissed though because Daub called the tech guys and had a lot of our game sites blocked out.  I can get around firewalls, but that leads to suspension and effort.  Neither of which I want.  Spanish:   I don't want to talk about Spanish because I hate it and it should die.  It should die........................  Math:   I love my math class.  It's so easy and fun.  Shane should us the movie that consisted of him, Hassan, and four cartons of eggs.  I enjoyed it immensely.  My teacher gave me a seashell which I will tell you about later.  It was for good luck.  Social Studies:   I hate Ms. Williams and she is a horrible teacher.  My grade is going to suck because of her poor teaching methods.  Today we reviewed for the final.  It included questions about rappers.  How in the fuck does that help me with remembering facts about Japan?  I wish I was never transferred to her class.  She should get fired.  Cisco:   I have been a captain for jeopardy every time this year, but she wouldn't let me today.  It was the mega-jeopardy!  How could she?  It ruined the game for me and everyone else.  We lost by over a thousand points because my captain is a dumbass.  Grrrrr!  I am going to fail that final.  English:   English is by far my favorite class.  The teacher is amazing and I really enjoy it.  Today I won a crazy award for like ten different things.  Shane and I are quite the trouble makers in that class.  In fact, he even showed his egg footage again.  It was good.  After School:   I went home and ate until I was completely full.  Then I studied for chemistry and math so that I don't fail them.  I was interrupted, however, by Bill and Joe who were at my door.  We ate pizza, played on the trampoline, and then went to Joe's house.  Joe's House:   Pool time fun.  I had a lot of fun throwing people into the pool, having water balloon fights and playing Frisbee.  Top hole mate.   Aside:   I still like her so much, but there's nothing that I can do about it.  She doesn't feel the same way and I really want her in my life.  I want to be a friend of course, but I can't help but want so much more.  All I can do is wait.......................................

      What can be said about today?  First of all, I don't like to wake up, let alone move of Sundays.  I may not believe in God, but I still believe that Sunday is the day of rest.  So anyway, I woke up about 9:00 and groaned a bit.  Not so much because of the time, but because I have felt like shit since yesterday.  For those of you who know what I'm talking about, I don't blame her and she was justified in her decision I suppose, but it still hurt quite a lot.  It's like one of those feelings where your heart is being squeezed so that all emotion leaves it.  Why would all emotion leave someone’s heart?  I'll tell you.  It's because that person is feeling extreme pain (the squeezing) and they eventually go numb (loss of emotion).  I think I'm doing better with it now.  It not so much anger and I'm just questioning myself now.  Why not me?  What did I do wrong?  Will I ever get what I want and feel that I deserve?  I haven't figured out the answers to these questions yet, but it will give me something to do during the summer.  So back to my day.  I fell back asleep after I woke up at 9:00 and reawakened at about 10:30.  Feeling that I should stop being pathetic and lazy, I got up and went downstairs.  After sloshing around for a bit, I sat down and watched The Rundown with my Dad and brothers.  I was so into the movie, however, that I didn't talk to them much.  Fortunately, I had some leftover ribs as company.  They didn't stick around long, but it's good to just sit around in your boxers and eat every once in awhile.  Did I mention that I love food?  Thank goodness I have a high metabolism or I'd be fat and undesirable.  That doesn't really matter though because my experience with women has taught me that I am, in fact, undesirable.  That wont ruin my time though.  It will just make it lonely.  So around 1:00, I got in the shower and made myself presentable to go to A.J's.  I know that sounds gay, but it isn't meant to be.  You see, there was an extra credit project for my chemistry class where we had to take a well known song and change the lyrics so that it was chemistry orientated.  We then would have to either record it or perform it for the entire class.  I'll post the lyrics to my song at the bottom of the entry.  The plan was for Dan, A.J. and I to make this music video at A.J's house.  This didn't happen though.  When we got there we were so unmotivated that we dismissed the idea and decided to eat instead.  Conveniently, one of A.J's older sister's was having a graduation party and there was plenty of food for us to eat.  Another plus about the party was that there was lots of women there.  There was only two problems with that.  Number one is that the girls ranged from about thirteen to sixteen.  You wouldn't think that's a problem, but we couldn't tell the ages of the girls.  They all looked the same age so I decided to leave well enough alone.  The second reason is that there’s a girl who I really like a lot and I can't even think of going out with someone else because I'm pretty much in love with her.  I know that sounds really pathetic, but I can't help it.  Anyway, since the flirting idea was out the window, we decided to just go to A.J's room and hang out.  While we were down there I got to play a Star Wars game which wasn't too exciting and I watched A.J's kick some Communist Russia ass with a wrench.  It was quite amusing.  Then I got an angry call from my mother where she told me to be home at 6:00 and yelled at me because the answering machine for my new cell phone says "mwa haha bitches!"  That reminds me, I should change that.  So at 6:00, I left A.J's and went home.  I took the long way of course because I hate being at my house.  When I got home, I put the bike away because I can't drive yet.  Then I came up to my safe haven, my room.  Then I started this site and am currently talking to Meg and Bailey so I'm going to write later.
