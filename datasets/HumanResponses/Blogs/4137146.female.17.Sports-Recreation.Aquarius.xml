       I mite get a new job.      I have an interview today at 5 o'clock down at the bowling alley. Waitress. Thats what im thinking. I need money so i need a job.       I also need to loose weight. Lol thats not going to happen though. STILL stranded at 140. Cheerleading practice has started. 3 hours long. Why wont i loose weight!? im dead tired after practice.. you would think it would be a workout but i wont loose weight. its stupid. get rid of at least 10 lbs. Hopefully 20.       Old job is ending. Lifeguarding is almost done. its the 18th and school starts the 22. TOO SOON. Gosh I dont want to go back. I DONT WANT TO BE A SENIOR! I dont see how its going to be avoided though.       Cheerleading practice. ITs going great. I'm so proud of our squad! We are doing awesome really soon in the season. Which definatly helps toward competition time!       I had my sr. pictures! It was fun. Not sure how they are going to turn out.. IT took 5 hours to take all of them. Thats kinda a long time. O well!!      I have an interview at 5 fer the job! So hopefully i'll still be makin money once skool starts!    Buhbye

Oh, Makeup! lol  What did I eat today... HRM A bowl of cereal a taco salad half a bag of popcorn and a doughnut  Oh I bought him a present.

      Wow I felt fat yesterday. Really fat. I wonder why I can't loose weight. This is completely ridiculous! All I ate was  A bowl of cereal peaches a hamburger a baked potatoe  Gesh. Maybe i ate more then i thought I had. I need to cut down. I didn't run any yesterday and I only ran a mile so far today. I'm a complete failure!  Last night i had sex with him. It lasted all of 30 seconds and I definatly laughed at him. I feel like we have this insane connection!! I just would die if he would take it away.  So far today I have ate  Pancake w/ light syrup 5 lil smokies 1 scrambled egg  That is kind of alot for just being awake 2 hours. But then again I did run a mile. Maybe that makes up for it? Maybe i'll go do another one just in case.  I have to go!

      Should I go?  Not quite sure.... Go and not have any money and make the buds happy? Stay at home and work and make myself happy? Ahh.. mineaplis is far away. 8 whole hours... thats a long road trip. Gesh. to top it off.. I feel like FATASS  What did I eat today  I think a better question should be what didn't I eat?    Cinnamon roll   A bowl of cereal  1/3 a bag of popcorn  a brownie  2 small burittos  another brownie  a pumpkin bar   Holy shit.. I didnt' even exercise.. well i did half n hour of water aerobics. But that isn't hardcore exercising. Maybe I should run fer about an hour. I'll run for an hour. Take my dog.   Anyways. I don't have much else new to say. I got the paycheck today. Didin't even break 300 which is definatly ridiculous. I definatly deserve a raise.   Well I have to go!

        hey,           This is my first time.  A blog virgin right here. I sapose that i should introduce myself. Im Seventeen years old, About to be a senior in high school and more scared than any one person should be.  Im looking forward to football season. I'm a cheerleader. Im excited for state football (our school is the reigning champs!)  Im excited for the many cheer competitions ahead of us. But im scared to death to end high school. I dont want to leave my life behind me. i feel that once high school is over EVERYTHING is over. im scared to loose my boyfriend. my friends. my everything. I felt that expressing my feelings out so other people could read them would help. Maybe it wont. Maybe im insane. I have the right to be. Anybody could be insane if they want to be.  I love my boyfriend. He is the best in the whole world. he IS my world.      School starts this month. Less than a month away. And then after this year my two year love affair with my boyfriend might end. What if we dont go to the same colleges. I can't live without him. It scares me that he doesn't need me as much as I need him. Like he holds a power over me. And he can get away with anything because I need him so much more than he needs me. I cant. I just cant.           Today.           What happened today?          I woke up at 10     Ran for an hour     went to work for an hour     I have to return to work at 5-9 (I'm a Lifeguard)          What did I eat today?          I had a bowl of  cerial Before I ran     I had a small portion of chicken and spaghetti      a small chocolate bar          How much do I weigh today?           about 140          SICK          I need to run... Run away!  Run away from the layer of fat covering my body     Senior pics are in 10 days          Its okay. I'll be okay          Just keep up the working out. I dont need any more muscle.. I need to loose weight. NOW.           I have to run.....
