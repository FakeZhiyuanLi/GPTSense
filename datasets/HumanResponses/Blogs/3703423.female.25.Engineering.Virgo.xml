      It's my 24th week of pregnancy, and I continue to watch my stomach grow each day. With every inch I gain, my worries propagate. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that it's a burden, in fact I'm so excited and I'm know it's definitely going to be a bundle of joy filled with endless cherishable memories that are just timeless. So what am I muttering about, what's the big ordeal?  How am I going to take care of him/her? How can I teach him/her well? To be a good person? To take care of himself/herself? Will he/she be good at school? What school should the child attend? How do I prepare for that? Will I transit my eczema to him/her? Where will I raise him/her? How do I deal with the conflicting ideas I have with his/her father? Can I financially support him/her? Who's going to take care of the baby when we are at work? Health issues? Will I know what is best for him/her? How will I know what is best for him/her? Are we too young?  I won't be as flexible as I was. I'm scared of balancing my life and priorities. Will other issues hinder my love and focus for the child. How can I prevent that from happening? They say everything will work out in the end, but.........It's a life, and I want it to enjoy life and understand life to its full extent.

      I've past most of my life wandering directionless, never questioning why, how, how come. most of the time, as irresponsible as i am, i take the easy route. All i do is have fun and satisfy my sudden impluse of that particular moment, not worrying about the consequences. My greatest strength is to "space out".  All I guess i never need to justify my actions b/c I never reminince the past or look back. I live for today and i worry later when i need to. Afterall, procastination is the key to determination.  Suddenly, thoughts from the back of my head, plus a caring husband, tell me that this is a problem. The problem continues to reveal itself and exacerbates constantly. I am coerced to think and review of my doings, ask why and how, and to act totally on what is appropriate. Urges they say will go away, but never your history........  growing up is hard, whoever is up there, please give me the strength to do what is right and still enjoy life.

      Barely an adult, I am soon to become a mother. Everyday, I get bigger and I grow out of my clothes, wondering if I will ever shrink back to the size I was before. However, this is the last of my worries. No longer is XL size underwear a priority of my life.  Other than the questions I face as my child grows, I stand now confused about my future in relationship to my family. What do I do with myself after the baby is born?  Should I work or not? Who takes care of the baby? Am I financially stable?  Answering these questions are not as simple as one, 2, three. Of course I want to work. It will keep me independent and connected to the world. I don’t want to be naïve and not know what’s right for my child.   The answer to the second question can ultimately alter the answer to my first question. Staying in California, I can anticipate that I will not be able to work unless one of our parents are willing to temporarily uproot their lives from where they are and relocate to California. This would be totally unfair for them. The second option is for us to relocate to Hk or Vancouver. Eddie doesn’t want to move to Vancouver, it’s not an option, his heart is in HK. But if we move to HK, there are too many things I need to face. Having a child is already a big enough change itself, but to totally assimilate into a new culture and way of life will be seriously problematic. Not knowing to read and write Chinese, nor having any work experience in HK, I do not know where to start finding a job to support the family. If I can’t find a job, I might as well stay in California. Next of all, I can’t convince myself that there will be no problems and conflicts living with eddie’s parents whom I have never met but heard scary stories from eddie that they are troublesome. Heck, I have enough issues with my parents already. Not to mention how my parents will react to me moving back to HK. And thirdly, the lifestyle change. It entails even the smallest thing. For example, taking the baby shopping or seeing the doctor. If it was in California, I can safely load the baby into the car and both of s can drive off comfortable and safely to our destination but if we were to metro it in HK, the baby would squish with many other people. I being not very strong will need to carry the baby and climb up and down through many places that are just infested with germs. The baby will go through a series of extremely hot and sweaty streets and cold air-conditioned buildings. Since taking the baby to a day care in California is out of the question, I thought of hiring a nanny to take care of the baby. Day cares are filled with children whom may have caught a flu from their elder siblings and pass it through the day care. But hiring a nanny will mean that my whole pay from working will be nothing. I might as well just stay home and spend more time with the baby. The third option is to let eddie’s parents take OUR PRECIOUS CHILD back to HK as we both remain in California to work. I can’t let that happen, I refuse to be departed from my child. Bearing this child, it has already consumed the best of my body. Removing it from me would leave me nothing but an empty shell. I want to be connected to the baby for it is already a part of me, if not all of me. Catch-22, I am back to step 1, should I work?   Am I financially stable? If I don’t work, heck no! all pending on my husband, eddie. No plan will work without his support. It seems I have so much to worry, do and think about but yet it doesn’t seem like it within my control.
