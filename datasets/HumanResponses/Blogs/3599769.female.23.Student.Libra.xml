       May 2001:  Lonely girl meets lonely boy. Boy falls in love with girl, then slowly girl falls in love with boy. They laugh, share, communicate on such a high level it doesn't seem real. He is the boy of my dreams even with his bad habits and faults.    Present Time:  Boy has questioned what he really wants out of life. May never want to get married, doesn't think its fair to girl. Girl wants to make up her own mind about that, not let someone choose for her. boy wonders if he really loves girl or just doesn't want her to be with anyone else. Girl thinks he caught the "boy" virus, the one thats fatal to his feelings.(It must be going around) Girl wants to work things out slowly. Boy has her heart in his power. Girl provokes his theories and gets inside his shell every now and then. Girl remains lonely and sad.    No, I'm not sure starting all over will make it work. I don't know what I'm really expecting, all i know is that I'm not ready to lay down just yet. And somewhere inside, I don't think he is ready for me to either. I blog all this cause i used up all my whine to my friends minutes. But in the end i think I just want to be satisfied in knowing I did all I could for me to be happy with him. Even if it only makes me feel better.

      Ooh, I'm so sad. Although God has sent down the rain to cheer me up, I can't help it. I want to throw a raging fit. You know, the kind where you kick and scream like you did when your mom refused to buy you a candy at the store when you were like 5. *sniff* Although I can't cry yet, I need to be a home for that first, I wish I could just feel peace. And believe I've been looking everywhere for it. I'm trying really hard not to be consumed. I think peace just might be playing a morbid game of hide and seek. It's kicking my ass in this game too. I used to feel so wonderful, peaceful, and just plain happy. Knowing that after being at work all day we could come and do nothing. Or just cuddle, or go to eat and have drinks or go to the movies, or rent one, or again just do nothing together. ee, thats the greatest part of being a "grown up" you can do whatever you want when you get home from work. Not like before when your parents said no to everything because it was a school night. I wish I could just....ARHHHHHH, why am I so whiny. Well it is my blog and I will whine if I want to. I annoy myself. I just want go back to May of 2001 when me and you firsst started and start all over again. I just want to feel realxed and peacful. I just want to stop whining now.

      What is the DEAL?!?! C'mon now, why can't I have a #1 Fan? I provide #1 fanness to someone. Why can't I ever be on the recieving end? (wah, wah) Okay I take some solace in knowing that I am in full "pity for myself" mode. So with that being clarified, let the ranting begin.   Says in her whiny, child baby voice:   Why can't I have you too make me see the silver lining in everything. Why can't I know that I don't have to always be the one that thinks or to work things out on my own. Why can't you do it #1 Fan? Where are you? For someone to over indulge me in gifts, know that they have bought me too much and spent way too much money. Or indulged me in  sweet nothings? And what the fuck is this guy looking at? -sorry. Or to call me and remind how wonderful my everythings are and to be so damm excited to call me you can hardly contain urself. ARGHHHH!! I'm just feel really frustrated right now. I want a #1 fan, and not in the stalking sense either. See if I had never beed adored at one point or another in my life by you, I wouldnt know what the hell I was missing. But you showed me what it was like and now its gone. So #1 fan, wherever you are, wherever you escaped to, come back and find me. I'll be waiting.

      Oh my God! They are coming!!! I can't wait. I wonder if I even be able to go. Money is limited right now. I'll have to fly up there or drive 5 hours and with the cost of gas it might be cheaper and easier to fly. Well see. I'm gonna go look for tickets....

      Okay, so today and yesterday have been clouded with schizophrenia. Not to mention that I now have a new illness to nurse: ADD. I mean how many mental illness can this girl get at once. While these are only self diagnosed, by a future psychologist I feel the need to have an intervention with myself. I mean one minute sad, one happy, one hopeless, one full of life and hope, one suicidal, one loving life, one angry, one non-chalant. SOMEone save me from me. So while yesterday was day three of BOOTCAMP for the brokenhearted I've kept my word, one phone call per day. And I have successfully have not initiated an outing. But yesterday I did see him and had Starbucks. It was just like old times until the rain clouds rained on my silent parade. And like Gollum, I had one evil little me beside me telling me to tell him to leave him nice and good, he doesn't love you. And the calmer version of me saying Nope, I am not a quitter and this is what I CHOOSE to fight for. Until of course I wash my hands clean of him. Which I might never do. God, help me. I've been reading LUCKY by Alice Seebold, just finished actually I had read Lovely Bones and once I like an author I keep reading what they write. Lucky is a tragic story bringing me back to where my reality meets real reality. Telling myself to quit being selfish and realize that your problems are zilch in scale to those who have been victims of crime. Or those with real recognizable problems. So to everyone whose heart aches like mine and to those whose heartache I will never understand-a moment of silence.

      To Julia: Thanks for reading these random, yet psychotic words and maybe even enjoying them. ;),  To Johnny: Your words are inspiring, now if only I can get him to see it the way that you do... To Karina: Yes, breakups suck, and your right ice cream does help. So does vodka, lol.  For anyone else who reads these insanity pleas, and for those of you who've read them, I just wanted to say the reason why we broke up is because of no reason. I know that doesn't make all that much sense and thats why hurt so much. Noone cheated on anyone or what not. At least not that I know of. But I always ask everyone: "Do you think a breakup is harder when there is no reason or rather if there was one?" My irrational answer to that is that to me breaking up for no specific reason is so much harder cause I dont have an outside person to blame. All we can do is point fingers at each other. And yes,I want to blame someone else for the downfall of my relationship because God forbid I did anything wrong.( making my shocked face, lol) My relationship to him was one that just fit together everywhere. You know how you can get when your in a relationship and everything seems just right? Thats how it was for me and him and it lasted that way for 2.5 years. Until all of a sudden we were fighting over the smallest things and it was hard just to be in the same room. We shared many of things together and those memories are etched in my head as if it were stone. So as of last night I started myself on a new round of BOOT CAMP. In this round, ladies and gentlemen I will not call him but only once a day and if he knows that I've called and didnt get my call then it is up to him to call me back. But oh lets just say I call and block my number and he doesn't know its me it does'nt count. What?, I was only kidding about blocking my number. wink, wink. LOL. So yesterday I called no answer so I left a message, and he called back within the hour. Talked for a couple of mins, and then bye. But then he called me later on at night before his beat started and we talked for 30 mins. Woohoo! 30 mins!!! My phone has a timer. And then this morning he called to wake me up and told me to drive carefully since last night produced some major storms and was still going. God, I love him for acting like he cares. So thank you God for letting him think of me and acting on it.

      1. To get married, have a home and a family to love me and to love.  2. To have a second chance with Mr.Rich.  3. To help raise my munchkins, like I did before.  4. To be 100% happy with my surroundings.  5. To become a stronger person. 6. To get my degree, no matter how long it takes. 7. To never take life, or anyone/anything for granted. 8. To act my age.  9. To not stress out about things that are beyond my control. 10. To learn to just be happy.  I don't know if anyone has read these posts besides me. I don't even know how to find my own posts half the time. But if I'm lucky and someone does run across this page, please note: I am not as ungrateful, or self absorbed as my rantings may make me seem. I've been re-reading what I have posted and realize how psycho i may sound. And how obsessed with Mr. Rich I may be. But not so, these are just things that fly into my head and sometimes consume me. He is in my life yes, but not the way I want him to be. Mostly I'm just justifying these rants to myself. But thats okay. Everyone needs a little reassurance that they are not as crazy as they seem every now and then even if it is coming from themselves. Great. Not only do I already talk to myself I'm writing to myself. So much for reassuring myself, lol. Note to self: Consider yourself CONSUMED.

      Thank you Christine for fixing my screwup. In case you read this.  So how come its okay for you to go out and then call me and tell me what you've done after you've done it but i go and have a couple of drinks at like 6 and i get the attitude. Ahh, you do care! lol. Anyways hearing the surprise in your voice that I actually left my apartment, it was priceless. And to think I wasnt even being mean when i said it either. How you didnt notice I was 2 drinks shy of drunkiness, I'll never know. So i decided you didnt need to know until today.Someone be proud of me, I'VE ACTUALLY LEFT THE APARTMENT!Jenn knows this guy who's like 2 8and has been in the same slumped I've been in, and get this its been two years for him! Lord, I dont know if i can stop myself from killing myself if it lasts that long. Maybe its time for the good time prescription as well as the good time drug. Ah, fuck it who cares. All i know is that i have an earache from hell and I'm slowly dying from fever. what a way to start the damm weekend.

      I know that I am a selfish person. I know that I have done bad things in my life that have hurt other people. I know that iI sometimes take things for granted. But please Lord extend me some compassion. I need your help. i can't function anymore. I'm soo tired of being sad. and hurt, and confused. Please Lord give me a chance to regain what i once had. Please Lord give us a second chance. I promise to be a better person, an diI know for the last 6 months I've tried really hard to be. Please Lord, help me. I miss my munchkins and my lovely boy. I need them more than anything and iI dont want ot live without them in my life. So if you can please find the time amongst the other million prayers (and i truly believe that there are more important ones than mine) to help heal my heart and intervene between me and him and help us regain our strength to be the couple we once wore. thank you Lord for all the blessings that I have recieved in my life, and for teaching me the biggest lesson: never take anything/anyone for granted. Thank you, Lord.

      today sucks, everything is stupid. last night i thought me and lovely boy would go out. i mean he did ask for me to find out what time hooters closed. then only to find out he is on his way to sherlocks with the booking gang. ugh! no we didnt have specfic plans. but damm, this sucks. i wonder what its gonna take for me to confront him on all of this?? i actually never will most likely. he broke up with me and broke my heart and thats when i decided to not speak of it to him again. why cant i just be him? i think hes very lucky to have someone like me--who loves him  too  much. i want someone to love me too much.i want to be him. i want to not think. period. no thinking. i wnat to not feel sad at certain times of days or cry because of certain songs. i want ot not feel depressed all the time or cry while i type this. i want to be on the recieving end of phone calls not the person calling. okay, i'll give u that u do call me. but i call cause i miss u terribly and want to know whts new in ur life, to play catch up and pretend as if im still apart of it all. u call and ur not sad ur happy. is  it all fake? are u really sad? do u really miss me? my guess is no. theres no use in false hope. or any kind of hope for that matter. Please God read this lonely girls blog and help me make something happen for the good of us both.

      well being sad really sucks. on sat. night the girls came over and blamed me for not going out with them. geez, as if thier sat. night depends on me. i now they just want to get me out of the house. but i just dont feel like it. i just want ot stay home and hide. but they stayed anyway. we did stupid girl stuff and it was okay. i miss him so much. i had a very sleepless night, and i can barely keep my head up right now. i dont know whats wrong with me. i just want to wake up and feel the same peace i used to feel, wake up and just be happy. i know my ultimate happiness does not rely on him but right now being with him will do me a world of good. i just want to love him and have him love me back. Please God give us a second chance. Please God. give me a shot at this one more time. i haven't been this sad in awhile. im true-blue sad today. or country music sad. maybe its the lack of sleep too. whatever it is i hope it doesn't last. i just want to be with him. in his arms. sleeping, dreaming and smelling him when we wake up. i just want him. Please God Please God.

      so this is a letter to you: i miss you. i love you. days like this or anyday triggers up all sorts of memories. u just called right now. ahhhh. i wish i could just call u back 100 times. hmmm, maybe i can...j/k. i wish we could go back in time 3 yrs ago to when this all started just so that i can get the wonderful feeling again. or i wish we were at the mayan riveria again or vegas or the grand canyon. remember how beautiful it all was? how much fun it was? im so confused, i just want to scream to you everytime u call that i love you but i know that tactic wont work. so im being sly. trying to act like i dont care much. more for you than me. i want to just feed you all the wonderful times but you know i think that only works on girls. see if this were reversed and u forced fed me memories i would break down and cry and quite possibly give in. lucky you. but its you. and gettting to ur core is so much harder. i thought i seeped into your shell and i did but now im back on the outside and all u have for me now is a soft spot. and maybe i keep you at ur weakest which is something u greatly fear. its okay. ur still my monkeyboy. and i still love you.

      well its God early in the morning. I had a good time last night, had a couple of drinks, went down memory lane, thought about how my life sucks and then back again to i have a good life. Which in all honestly i really do. i feel as if someway thinking that aloud is gonna make it go away. lets just knock on wood for good measure. well i called him at 3am, i know he's awake cause he's working and he did answer but then seem to get annoyed with me when i said my tummy hurt which it seems to be doing alot lately at 3 am. subconciously making it hurt in the middle of the night???? maybe. the body is a wonderous thing. my pysche is creeping up on me and maybe i really want it to hurt so that i can have a reason to call. damsel in distress syndrome. or not cause my stomach just gave me a kick for questioning its intentions. what to do, what to do. i miss him. if by some unknown power i can telepathically send u a message its this: call me, i miss you. lets get back together. there now thats coming from a true pathetic. i wish it would hurry up and just rain. thunder, lightning, the works please. i hate work. but i gotta make that money, honey. i swear that im schizo. one minute sad.  one minute happy, one minute confused, and then back to sad again. hmm, i think i need to concentrate on being happy. oh, but i'm so good at being sad now. k, gotta go cause im annoying myself and prolly anyone else who will read this.

      Is it bad that even though I rarely work, I still got a quarter raise? Should I feel bad? Cause I really don't.   Yesterday was extremely uneventful, no surprise. Watched a bunch of useless t.v., gabbed on the phone. Very woe is me.   Tonights mission is to clean up the apt. I keep saying that but haven't actually gotten around to doing it. What fun. On a Friday nite. Ah, Phooey. I wish that workday time would whizz by, and then slow a little when I drive home. Traffic's gonna be a bitch.   My horoscope (all 50 of them that I read on a daily basis) say I need to stop reminiscing and focus on the now. Pfft. Easy for them to say, but I will try fervently to take this advice. So heres to looking at the now.&nbsp; And trying to appreciate it.   Why is it that noone's blogging incessently? don't you know that I live to look at other peoples blogs? c'mion bloggers BLOG. If for anything, for this lonely girl to say busy without letting her mind wander into the past.

      Last nite was pretty interesting. Me and Notorious DEST went to have max 2 beers. Don't I ever learn my lesson when I'm with her? And besides don't ever tell 2 lonely girls that 6 count beer buckets are only 10.00 for the next 5 mins.   Then I suddenly remember how much I want to have sex. Almost like an awakening. I was very tempted to drunk dial lovely boy and ask/beg him to come over after work.&nbsp; But drunk dials weren't my humilation of choice last night. That was Notorious D's.   Mine was telling anyone within earshot how "I just wanted to wear a ring on my left hand that meant something, dammit." That sentence stirred up all sorts of convos. I swear 8 beers and loneliness later I was unbelievably feeling pretty good. Must have been the beer. So I stumble home, and decide to drunk dial all my friends, which was just as fun.   Today my stomach WILL NOT stop rumbling. It just keeps gurgling.&nbsp;I don't like using the restroom here at work&nbsp; because it sucks. So I can't wait&nbsp;to go home. *sigh*&nbsp;  Elizabeth, I want to give you my email but I want to only post it up for a min. since it is both my first and last name. Do you have yahoo messenger? If so let me know.&nbsp; If not, Comment on here and I will post my email and leave it for a bit and then remove it. Thanks.

      I haven't read a good book in about 2 weeks now. I've been too distracted to say the least. But reading is the one thing that takes me away from my reality and into someone else's fiction. So reading it is! i just need to find the right book.   I wonder what will be on T.V tonight. Nothing good prolly. I wish someone would come whisk me away to A Makeover Story. Or better yet, I will invent a new reality show and it will have the same concept except it will make you over from the inside. You will see various shrinks, try different drugs, attend self-help seminars. And you won't be able to look in the mirror for the next three months. I'm sorry but those are the rules....  Its almost lunch time! And I'm starvin'.

      It might make me feel better. It might not.  Damm crank yankers. Quit calling.   Who knew it would still be hurting this bad? I keep wasting precious time on being sad instead of being happy. Realizing you have a problem is the first step...  I feel so ALONE. I wish I could make him see where I'm coming from. Yeah, right. If I would have known that this was gonna happen maybe I would have never allowed myself to give so freely. I want it back now.   I'm so tired of feeling like this all the time. I'm playing "psych myself out" games, in order to restore some kind of mental clarity. There aren't working yet.&nbsp; So if anyone has any new games for me to play please let me know.   I wonder if I have bad karma? I swear I try to follow the golden rule.   Woh, Woh, Woh.

I don't do drugs. 36. But I smoke.  37. I like to drink, but always feel so guilty the next morning.  38. I want to start all over again.  39. I don't do any work all day, and my desk is a mess.  40. I used to be the "lucky" one. 41. It took me moving out at 18 for me and mom to really have a relationship. 42. I will never move back home.  43. I give advice, but never seem to take it. But I greatly appreciate it.  44. I wish more people would visit my blog and comment.  45. I wish I would have went away to college. 46. I need to wash my car. 47. I'm on the road to recovery. A long road.  48. I haven't had that "excited" feeling in my stomach about anything in about a year. 49.&nbsp;I whine too much. 50. Sometimes I think about dying. But I'm seriously not suicidal. Does that make sense?

      So here I am. Blogging. Again.  &nbsp; I just need to keep busy doing something. Besides sending him pyshic messages to call me. Which don't seem to be working. I hate working! I hate that everyone I know is working and actually doing work. I feel like sleeping.  &nbsp; Only an hour and a half to go. I wish I had a book to read.&nbsp; I just bit off all my nails, and they feel gross now. Not very attractive. Next comes the lip-biting. And then the inside cheek-biting. &nbsp; I'm gonna be 24 in two months! I feel like a loser. I really thought by this time things would be different for me. I'm just the&nbsp;marrying kind of girl. I believe in  love  and it seems to be one of my  biggest downfalls. Why is that the word " love " and&nbsp;" hell " conjure up the same color? &nbsp;Isn't that weird, someone at least got that straight.  &nbsp; I believe in alot of stupid things. Good for nuthin' kind of things.&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Let's see, today I feel like shit. Less so, than yesterday. So that's a start right?&nbsp; i'm in a pretty pissy mood. I have noone to talk to on the phone, seeing as how everyone actually works at work.&nbsp; Not me. I come here to blog.  &nbsp; I wonder why girls can always conjure up the worst scenario possible. If your not one of these girls ~congrats. &nbsp;In my head right now I imagine that my lovely boy is in the arms of some ho'. Truth or not, its killing me. I also can picture him taking her to out to eat, I can even imagine his lips moving as he talks to her. What the fuck is up with that? Have I gone completly insane? &nbsp; I'm serious, if it were'nt for blogging, I'd be dialing his number 100 times trying to figure out if any of my evil thoughts are true. So instead I can on here to type the words that are floating around in my head.  &nbsp; I also imagine that he has taken her to the house that we lived in together. She's walking around on MY hard wood floors. The ones I insisted we have installed. Shes sitting on my toliet. Eating from my kitchen. I know, I know, there no longer mine. I also fear that she is there with MY munchkins.&nbsp; Talking and playing with them. May she burn in  hell.   &nbsp; I think I smoked too much today already. I can't help it. Mostly it just gives me something to do as I pace around. I feel like my teeth are going to rot and fall out. I hate just about everyone.  Mostly I just hate myself. No use in blaming innocent people.  &nbsp; I miss my old life. I miss him.  &nbsp;

      Can I at least get some quality T.v?  &nbsp; I did nothing all weekend but hang out in front of the tube. And there was nothing to watch. Give a lonely girl a break. Considering that my funds are down to zero, I spent my last dinero on ciggys. And a beer. I swear, I'm no better than the whino out on the corner.  &nbsp; I'm trying to feel better, but at this rate it may take a couple of years. If Timmy is God, then Timmy hear my prayers and get your ass into gear! I've been waiting for a non-conventional miracle, and believe me buddy I'm due.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      1. Try and be positive 2. Try and smile at more people, instead of thinking "Fuck Off" in my head. 3. Start wearing makeup again 4. Start using my hairbrush, dryer, and straghtner again too.  5. Get some sun. 6. PSych myself out whenever "evil lovely thoughts" infest and try and conquer my head.  7. Try and not fuckin' drink everyday. I'm such a drunkass.  8. Sloooooowwww down on smoking. Damm, girl! 9. Realize that it is ultimately his lost (which he has already admitted) and that there is nothing I can do to change his mind.  10. Try and laugh more than 5 times a day.    Tommorrow I will take it all back, but here's written proof that I once thought these sane, rational thoughts.

      I was a truly happy girl. I used to be on top of the fuckin' world. What happened? I just reread all my previous blogs and I'm dying. Inside I'm just dying. I still cannot believe that I feel this way, that I am weak enough for someone to trigger all this. Our breakup, in almost every true sense is like a divorce. Except I don't get to see my munchkins. Or my house.   Yesterday he said, "In my mind you represent everything that I want, stability." Thanks alot fucko, I can clearly remember about 3 yrs ago when he asked me what I was looking for, that was my exact answer. See thats why I didn't ever think I'd be in this situation~we were looking for the same thing. And then he had to go and fuck it all up.  I asked him when was the defining moment (if any) when he wasn't in love with me anyore. He said there isn't one. So I asked well then why did you fall out of love with me?  His reply was "i'm stupid, and I don't know what I'm doing."  Once again, thanks alot fucko.  Someone just please come and take this pain all away. I'm so tired of hurting.

      Besides obsessing.   Last night me and bro and his friends drank ourselves silly. Again. What the hell is wron gwith me? I once again, drank and smoked too much. I feel like shit this morning. And on top of all that my lovely boy called again last night.   But it wasn't really good news. So I guess its just truly over and its time to move on. But why don't I want to. I feel like throwing a screaming, crying fit.   Why do I hate feel like I hate everyone? Why do I hold on? To nothing?

      Let's see in my pocket I have a sample of a low-grade Xanax pill. But do I take it? I'm afraid. What if makes me sick or worse, more anxiety-sticken? I really want to take it , to see if it helps.   I don't want to learn any more of "life's little lessons". Is there any way to stop them? *sigh* I'm just being a whiny child baby. And also I'm feeling sorry for myself. Again.

      I feel like playing practical jokes on everyone today. And the weird part is I think I just feel like doing it because I feel like being mean. Isn't that some form of mental illness?   Well so much for positive thinking. It's not like I want to hurt anyone or anything, I just want to play jokes but kinda of mean ones, for my entertainment purposes. I'm prolly gonna go to hell for thinking that way, either that or get some kind of bad karma sent my way.   I hate work, I had the option to leave yesterday but I never did instead I just stayed on the phone all afternoon doing nothing. But now I wish I could go home and sleep today. I'm just tired. But thats prolly due to the depression.  I'm hungry, I want to eat movie nachos. And popcorn. How weird. But I have this huge craving for it.    Why would I want to be with someone who didn't want to be with me?

      Here I am blogging, to see if this will help ward off an attack. I'm typing faster as if its gonna catch with me.  I'm trying to pinpoint what initiated it. wait, I can't reallly keep a straight thought. I think it has alot to do with not facing the truth. I don't think I've faced the truth alot here recently. A year ago, my highschool sweetheart died and I still havenn't ever really think about him being gone. I kinda blocked it out. And now these things with my lovely boy have happened, and somewhere I have this stupid hope that releases in small doses. You know, the kind where he all of a sudden comes crying back. What the hell is wrong with me? Oh well. Maybe after my dr.s appt. things will be looking up and maybe these feelings well subside somehow, some way.

      Since my boss won't let me leave right away, I've decided I'm going to blog. Again. Ha. I told her tha I wasn't doing any work. She's paying for nothing which isnt a bad thing, but i just really feel like I need to go home. i'm tired and I just want to watch tv, and not think. But if I just sit here my mind just wanders off, and then I want to start crying again. I'm ready for this to end. I think I might be able to convince myself that I'm gonna let him go. Or at least try and fake it. Hmmm, since I don't really have a choice I guess we'll see.   I used to always tell "Think positive" and positive things will happen. So I'm going to try real hard to be more positive from now on.

      I'm gonna blogging all day until today is over cause I'm borderline gonna flip out and close shop and go home.   I called my mom crying just a bit ago. Poor her, she was fast asleep. She asked me whats wrong, and I told her the same thing. She said you need to let go, i know you don't want too but you need too. Don't let him get to the point to where he hates you. I think thats the best advice my mom's ever given me. Then she broke down and cried. She said she knows I think its the end of the world, but it will get better. We all loved him, but you need to let him go. Trying to make him feel something that he doesn't isn't gonna help the situation. In the end it will all work out, you watch. I've never wanted to believe my mom so much before.   So God, if you read blogs please stop by and read mine. I pray that everything works out for all of us. I pray that someday things do get better and that I will reflect back and still think that all this pain was worth it. I pray for everyone who has been there for me. I pray that I will somehow manage to get my feelings in check, and learn that not everything goes the way that you think it will.

      This morning I feel like shit.  Why do I keep thinking that drinking will make me feel better? Or that smoking would? Not only am I physically sick, Iam still emotionally fucked up. I made myself throw up yesterday just to get the room to stop spinning. Mornings have always been the hardest for me. I haven't slept a peaceful night in a really long time. I'm talking at least a year. Mornings are the saddest, I wake up and realize my life is still as fucked up as it was when I went to sleep the night before. I think me and my lovely boy are through. I told him yesterday while I was buzzing that whateva girl he's talking to is gonna fuck him over. He stayed real quiet, cause I'm usually the one the encourages him not the one that tears him down, then he said thanks and said he'll talk to me later. Which of course, my drunkass could not accept. So I called back but no answer. So then I called his mom, and she repeatdly reminded me that no boy is worth this much pain. How come even thought I know that, it still hurts like hell and I can't make it stop. I think the mental ward is gonna come looking for me too, I remember vaguely telling her that I just wanted to die. I'm sure that didn't sound too healthy.    What the Fuck am I doing?!?!

      This blog is repetitious and is filled with my feelings, but after this weekend I needed an outlet to say what's on my mind.  Take them from my head and my heart and keep them. I don't want them anymore. I wish that I had never met you, even though I'm glad I did. I wish that I would have never kept any of my promises so I wouldn't hold you to the ones that you made to me. I wish that in my head there wasn't someone new in your life, even though in reality there really might be. I wish I didn't care so damm much about my munchkins. That I would lay my life down for them. I wish that I could open the top of my head, and with a scapel scrape the bits and pieces that you have infested. I wish my favorite part of the day wasn't connected to you in any way. I wish that I could stop saying "I can't believe that this is happening to me". I hope that I can in the near future say those exact words because everything is so great. I wish that I could be the one who doesn't feel the same anymore. I wish that you would have never have said "This is it, this is what its all about." They meant so much to me. I wish those words were true. I wish I never had you on a pedestal as high as the one your on, cause no matter how high I jump I can't knock you off. So you can take all the memories and choke on them and realize that that's how I've been feeling. I know what we had is over and facing that reality doesn't really make me feel any better. I'm not stupid, or naive. I know that we must/will go on. I just never imagined it would be without you in my life. You took so much so I'd like it returned. And in return I will gladly give you our memories. So yes, I still feel the need and want to be with you because I love you not because I don't think I can't live without you. I know that I can live without you, I just think life would be a lot more fun with you and my munchkins. I hope you find the happiness you are looking for, the one you couldn't find with me anymore.

      But he may also be my savior. Today is move-in day for him. Move-in to my apt. complex that is. How funny. He is 19 yrs old and is the cockiest lil' boy I know. See, me and him were never really close, and now all of a sudden he is going to live a couple of doors away from me. (I moved to my grma's house when he was in 5th grade) He just called me, seems all of a sudden I'm invited to his party tonight at the new place and seeing as I'm the only one legal enough to buy the drinks if I'd mind stopping at the liquor store and picking him up something. Go figure!  But thats okay, he doesn't know the wrath of his big sis's depression. LOL. Late nights at his place to keep me busy should be fun.

      Me and my sistor (its gotta have the  o )  connected. She was about 4 yrs old.   I get into my mom's car and my dream was still so fresh in my mind, I keep thinking about how I had dreamt about feeding human legs (detached from their bodies) to a hungry shark. Like it was an attraction at SeaWorld or something. Weird. But then my sis looks at me and says "I had a dream about a shark yesterday." I completely freaked out! I hadn't even told a soul about my dream, I had just woken up about an hour before she came. She just looks at me and then tells me to put my seatbelt on. Now she's the most petite 7 yr old I know and such a ham!  Last night I dreamt about a shark and a whale. And a fire that destroyed the tank that they lived in, leaving them only in shallow pools of water. I'm standing there freaking out thinking one of these massive creatures is going to swallow me whole.   My derangement has followed me into my sub-conscious world. Now, the sleep Gods cant't cut me a break. What next?

      I looked at the clock, exactly 3 I knew that he would be getting ready to leave for work and it's his first day in gang. I wanted to call him so badly, but I called Jenn instead to keep me busy. Line 2 rings, I get off the line with Jenn. It's his voice. I already know but I asked who it was anyways.   You: Busy? Me: Uh,nuh. YOu: I can't hear you. Me: I said no. You: Do you still have the pic of me in full uniform? Me: Yeah. (Its still posted at my desk dumbass) You: Do you think I can have it? Me: (biting my lip) You can have whateva you want. You: I just want that pic, in case I die I'd like to have a good pic of me. (his job safety just went down about 500+ points so very much a possibly) Me: Not funny. Well if you die, I'll make sure they have that pic.  You: I just want to frame it and put it in the house. Me: No. YOu: Please. ME: No. (He already knows I'm gonna give it to him) You: Yep, first day today. I'm gonna bring home a cruiser soon. My uniform is really hot I'm sweating and I'm in inside. I'm gonna have to show you my uniform sometime.  Me: Uh, huh. Well, I'm very happy things worked out so well for you.  You: (sullen) Yeah. Oh, I need to put my contacts on, call you back.  Me: yep.    click

Chances of us getting back together... a)don't hold your breath b)only if like non-girlfriend says about him taking meds c)most likey, but then again maybe not   4. If I see him out with another girl will I ... a)throw a drink in his face b)make sure he sees that I see him and shake my head in disgust c)run out crying   5. Will I get to talk to him... a)in the next 5 days b)never c)in a month or longer   Why are boys such Namby Pambies?

      Isn't that a wonderful combo. I'm serious, last night i decided I was gonna go to the poolhall/bar up the road from me for a beer by myself. Next thing i know a man is sitting next to me, talking about life and marriage and such and its like 845pm. I got there like at 530pm. So it turns out he lives in my complex, the thing is I think I told him which apt. I'm in and now I'm scared. I didn't in any way feel threatned but I acted so irresponsibly. I never even go to bars by myself, much less talk to some stranger. So all night I kept thinking to myself he's gonna knock at my door and I'm gonna freak. Not to mention, I'm so freakin' paranoid about everything, and that just escalated it. So now I feel like shit, I look like shit. So then I get to sleep like at 12am, and wake wide awake at 230am and stay awake until 5am. I'm freakin' out majorly. I called him last night too, and he was getting a fitting for his uniforms, small talk for like 3 mins. but that was it. I know, I'm not gonna call him anymore. Nothing much happened with his mom at lunch, I stayed away from bringing him up but she volunteered some info on what he did yesterday and such but nothing enlightening. I swear I'm gonna need anti-depressents soon cause I don't feel like myself at all anymore. I feel like I'm invisible and I feel downright scared.

      Step right up, ladies and gentleman.   The one the only, The Whipping Girl.  No, you cannot whip her, but please feel free to snowball her with your spew of hateful words. C'mon go ahead, she's already at her lowest point in her life, nothing you can say now well destroy her.   ( Crying )  You: We need to talk. Me: (heart drops) Okay. You: i really thing we should put some distance in between us. Me: (knowing thats how breakups usually work, but doesn't want to believe it) Why? You: Because, I'm selfish and I only keep contact with you so that your not with anyone else. Me: Duh. You: I'm sorry. ( my reasons are somewhat the same) Me: Why? I'd like a explanation. You: Because I don't feel the same way about you anymore.  Me: I need more justification, what does that mean? What are u looking for? How could you pretend like I never existed? Why are u making me invisible? I hate you. You: I'm not making you invisible, I just have no intentions of being with you and its not fair to you or me. And if I knew what was making me do this I would make it stop.   Me: Are you fuckin' serious, all I wanted was a fighting chance. And you just want me to say okay so that you can have enough validation to be with new people. And if you think that my munchkins have stopped loving me or thinking about me this whole time your wrong. WRONG. You: (breaking down, sniffling) I know that. I just, I'm sorry. I'll call you back. Me: Please don't let this be the last time I talk to you. Please.  You: No i promise you it won't.   Me: crying, hysterically. Wondering who the hell up there thinks it funny to make me cry.  I know that I took some easy shots, and more was said, but thats pretty much the whole of it. So, please someone I know that breakups are supposed to be like this and are supposed to hurt, and that they make movies about this all the time but damm. I hate being the launch pad. Next girl he meets he will have realized that he does want all the things that we once had, and he will marry her.    So for all the boys out there, who treated that one girl real good but decided to let her go, you suck. and you never would know how good life with her could be because you didn't try.    Once he told me that my best talent was that I was a survivor. Up yours.

      So today, I'm thanking God a thousand flowers that's its Friday and Monday is a holiday and I get paid for it!!!! So if that's not something worth jumping up and down for then I don't know what is. I'm mad busy today at work but I don't care cause I'm having Chinese buffet for lunch with Rich's mom. BONUS!!! And another bonus is he will be back in town today. U were gone too long hunny bunny. Ahh, at least I can still baby talk him on here.Last night me and Jenn attempted to go to the gym but they wanted to charge her 15.00 for one day!! Shame on you Gold's Gym! So instead we went back to my apt. and did beginners yoga from the on-demand channels. It actually soothed my aching back but today's the pain is back. I wish it would have kept raining over here but the sun keeps coming out.    Dammit, I just peeled my cuticle and its bleeding a red river. Especially when I do this... ouch.Maybe I'll bleed to death and then everyone will be sad. And they will say all the customary stuff about me when I die. Like, I was such a giving person that I would give up the shirt that I was wearing if you needed it. (In real life, it depends whether the shirt is name brand or not in which I case may have paid too much for it and I'd still like to wear it.) Or how I was so thoughtful. (Did I ever mentioned selfish in my profile?) Or how I had my whole life ahead of me and that I was someday going to become the PSYCHOLOGIST I wanted to be cause I'd like to help unyielding persons. (tru dat!) Or how i was loved by many, okay, okay considering family and close friends I would believe it if they added this in my eulogy. Well I guess today that is not a possibility cause I've already stopped bleeding. Planning my death comments will have wait, hopefully wait a realllll long time. Oh, I just remember don't you hate running into x's? Well Jenn ran into one of mine, well actually his sis, the girly is prego (me and her were really close, but due to her asshole bro I cut off all contact with thier whole fam so I wouldn't keep getting sucked back in) turns out he now lives with his gf and is leaving to the navy for 5 yrs. what a jip! I was his first serious relationship gf and now I bet he's this great guy and is prolly gonna marry this girl. C'mon who waits 5 yrs for u to come back unless your gonna get married? Once again, I've been shafted. Who cares he was a fuckin' loser anyway. Green-eyed monster, anyone? But he really was a loser. So whateva.

      How can I post pictures on here? I know about that HELLO program, but does that only work with pictures I have saved in a folder? If, so I cant remeber how I got those pics in the first place. Also, how do I create a link list or something that shows other blogs that i have been reading?  If anyone can help, thanks.

      I'm feeling too frustrated to do anything today. My workload is too big, and i just feel like breaking dowm. I hate feeling so melancholy. I was fine, but then I had to cancel a client who was'nt qualify so now I'm back to square 1. I just wish I could fly to Greece, where in my mind nothing bad happens. Or to the make belive world that Legend takes place. All those posies flying around and unicorns playing. Minus the part where everything turns dark, because everyone knows your not supposed to touch the unicorn. I dont't even know what I'm rambling on about now. I just wish everything was my definition of normal.

      Its Friday the 13th. Is anyone out there superstitious? I am, but not the whole step on a crack break your mothers back kind just the knock on wood kind.  Surprise, surprise. Lovelyboy showed up last night on his new toy (motorcycle) asked me if I wanted to go for a ride. I said sure, be right back. I needed to put on something motorcycle-ish. I think my white see through wife-beater shirt with a black bra clearly showing and tight Gap jeans did the trick. Seeing his expression only gratified my semi-slutiness. Ha! He knows I hate motorcycles, on my 19th bday I actually saw two people get thrown from one and the girl died. Ever since then I'm afraid to drive near them much less get on one. But the other day I did and it was fun. And when he picked me up on it yesterday he asked if I was afraid and I said not anymore. I don't have to talk while we ride and its so relaxing. Minus the part where we turn and I feel like I'm gonna get thrown into the street. Also, I think he likes the part where I have to hold on to him for dear life. Who knows with him, I seem to be wrong a lot. Anyways that was a quick update. Oh, and I'm proud cause when he brought me back he said okay, well I need to go all I said was k' bye be careful. He did give a couple of good hugs and stared into my eyes a couple of times, but only Lord knows if he does that to the other girl as well. I'm just gonna pretend its only for me. Pfft. whatever. (I also didn't call him, like I would have before, see, I'm really trying this time.)  Anyway, its Friday and the weekend is here once more. Thank God. Although I hate Sundays. What is everyone up to this weekend? I think I'm going to the movies (another improvement) to see "Little Black Book" or something girly like that. I don't know. Not much to say really just bored and thought I'd try and post something instead of reading everyone else's. More later.

      Pfft. Whatever. That's what my online fortune cookie said.  Haven't I made it clear that I DO NOT like change. Of any sorts. Unless its changing my clothes. This week already has been such a trying week. Happy to say I'm still here.  So I found out that he is talking to someone new. I just asked him, told him I wanted to hear the truth from him. He said yes, but not like how I think. Whatever, what am I supposed to think. So somehow him actually admitting to this put things in a little more prespective. I don't know why, I guess I just wanted him to say it so I can stop deeming him a liar. He then preceeded to tell me that I was the most important person in his life, but that he wasn't the right one for me. Thanks. For some odd reason I thought that was my decision to make. So thats it. For now, why lie? I have not called him or anything since that convo. And he was the one to call me in the first place, he wanted to show me his new toy.  So I guess everything comes to an end. And somehow I don't feel all that rotten. I  still hurt, but I think the fact that he has told me the truth somehow let me me mourn in a different way. I have no hope left for us. I just know that someday he will think of me. I will try and distance myself as much as possible but I am weak so I know I will succumb sooner or later. Hopefully way later.  As for blogging, it seems to be my highlight everyday. Well, reading others that is. I always want to post but then I just don't do it. I guess I felt like I was whining too much and the masses where gonna come and tell me to quit being a baby already. But I'm throwing those thoughts out. If I need to vent I will. Off to start a new and somewhat better me. I know that I am capable and worthy of having a love so strong that it could withhold anything. I just need to stop pushing and stop looking.   Whatever, I'm just glad that I am making it one day at a time.

      Apparently I do. And not by choice.  Friday night: My bro and I decided to have too much too drink, again. I started off right, with shots of Rasberry vodka and somehow ended up with Budweiser. WTF? Anyways I played bathroom patroll for my bro since he kept throwing up every 5 mins and his gf was nowhere to be seen. I stumbled home and passed out.  Oh, and no drunken phone calls. Woohoo!  Saturday: Did alot of driving around. For no reason. Couldn't sit still, but didnt really want to talk to anyone. So I just drove and drove. So depressing. But I did manage to visit my friend at the cemetery. It was nice talking to him, although stupid inconsiderate me forgot that his dad, (who died a year later, almost to the date) was buried right next to him. I didnt even think to talk to him too.  So after I left and realized what I didn't do I felt like shit all over. That was only the second time I have gone to his gravesite in the year and half since his death. The first time wasn't even at the time of his burial. So I decided to turn in early, but at 10pm I hear someone banging on my door and get this: I grabbed my ciggys as if it were a gun. Oh my God, when I realized I had done that I couldn't stop laughing. It turns out it was my bro, crying. I thought something really bad had happened. It turns out him and his gf broke up and I'm talking this boy was screaming crying, all huffy and couldn't breathe. I asked why he was so upset, they were always breaking up. He said that she told him she didnt feel the same way and that it just wasnt gonna work. (Sound familar?) All he kept mumbling was "This isn't supposed to be like this, if it doesnt work for a reason, okay then. But its not gonna end because we just didnt want to try. I am not gonna fail at this." Once again, sound familiar? I wonder if it runs in my family? Is it contagious?  Sunday: I went to church, and couldnt stop thinking about how cold I was. After that had lunch with my aunt, then went home. Tried to nap but didnt succeed. Then my bro went and picked up my sistors and we tooked them swimming and ate pizza and watched movies. It was fun, but reminded me terribly of my munckins. They just got home on sat. from a 2 wk stint with thier mom. Lovely boy was off on sun. and prolly spent some quality time with them, time that I miss dearly.  Sunday night finally closed and I was thankful. Mornings and Sundays are the worst for me.  Thank God the mornings almost over.

      So today has not been a very good day. I have retorted (once again) to self pity. I have also in my head conjure up the thought that my lovely boy will go out tonight with another girl. Tonight is no different than any other except that his schedule does not permit him to have a Friday nite off like tonight. So therefore in my head he will be doing fun things with another Girl.  I know that I am crazy and today only magnifies my craziness. I've even planned there outing for them. I don't think I'm gonna make it through the night. Why do I do this to myself? Even though I know that it doesn't necessarily need to be a Friday for him to take a girl out but what better night than tonight. I haven't talked to him since the episode on Tuesday.  Oh, God or Timmy whoever can answer prayers faster, PLEASE, PLEASE let him see the errors in his ways. Okay, okay a little dramatic and maybe there not all his errors. But dammit, I 'm willing to give it another shot. (no surprise)  HE DOESN'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE. I realize that, but it doesn't seem to make things on my end any better. I wish I was addicted to something else besides him. I know I sound pathetic, I just couldn't help blogging once more on why my life is shit.  Self- pity session ends now.  "Nobody loves you when your 23...."  Okay now.

      Another wonderful idea from the NG herself.  1. I blame the Marlboro company for my inevitable short life. 2. I blame my father for blessing me with co-dependency. 3. I blame my mother for keeping it real. 4. I blame lovely boy for everything. 5. I blame love for treating me like shit. 6.I blame The Cure for keeping me depressed. (Not really, seeeing as how I lOVE them) 7. I blame fate for cursing me. 8. I blame my boss for my bad work ethics. 9. I blame my car for needing an oil change. 10. I blame the sun for not enough Raineydays. 11. I blame Non-Girlfriend for her wonderful site, and inspiring me to start my own. 12. I blame blogging for my compulsiveness. 13. I blame hope, fear, love for the person that I am today. 14. I blame my bro for non-stop drinking. 15. I blame Notrious DES for my rowdy behavior while drunk. 16. I blame Jenn for my thoughts on contemplating my own death. (Ha!) 17. I blame society for allowing me to grow up in a cruel, cruel world. 18. I blame boredom for browsing blogs every 10 mins. 19. I blame money for making me work. 20. I blame Mexican food for keeping small love handles on my waist line.   I will so definitely have more to blame in upcoming posts.

      I need everyone's help. Today after 5pm I will be meeting with lovely boy. Mostly I just needed to see him. I need to hear his voice. I need to know what to say. I know all the things I'd like to say but I also know I need to keep some diginity.  I'd like to say that I love him more than life. That I need him. I need to be around him to feel him. But I know that I shouldn't. It wouldn't make the least difference, I'm sure. I need him to know how I feel without going insane. Its eating me alive.  So please anyone point me in the right direction. I know that my relationship is over with him, and that I feel the loss more than he. I just need the right words to get my feelings across. Any and all comments would help. Thank you.
