      Nothing better than to have my window open, pouring rain, a fleece blanket, my laptop and of course a cup of hot chocolate.  Life is sweet!  :-)

      I want an SUV.  Please talk my other half into getting me one!  I don't need anything huge, maybe just a Chevy trailblazer.  (hint hint)  In a nice color.  Black, Blue or maybe even Red.   If you have an SUV, please post what you have, the pros and cons to having one, etc.  Thanks!

      I love the rain.  It rained here all day.  There's nothing better than to have your windows open and have everything in the house on mute.    Pickles would have to agree with me on this one.  He is sleeping on the window sill as I type.  Just something about the rain is so relaxing.  I might just have to go play in it!  :-p

      I love coupons.  In case you didn't know.  Which you should know.  Otherwise you are not my friend.  Anyway, I got 10 bottles of Suave shampoo today at Weis.  They are on sale for .88 per bottle.  I had a .50 coupon which they double to $1.00 thus I made a profit on them.  .88 per bottle minus the $1.00 coupons I had equals .12 overage.  They paid me .12 per bottle.  10 bottles times .12 overage equals $1.20 profit and alot of clean hair.      I also got a 2-liter bottle of Pepsi Edge tonight.  Free of course with coupon.  Did you expect anything less?  My opinion?  Not worth it.  Way to overrated and watery.    I also got 8 boxes of Kellogg's cereal for about $1.50.  Not free.  Very upsetting.  Pretty good deal.  Now I need to get me hands on some milk coupons.  They are out there.....    Until next time, please email me with your coupon experiences.  I love to hear them.

      I started my new job today.  It went well for my first day.  They require you to read 6 books and answer the questions that follow.   Each book takes about an hour.  I got two of the six books done today.  I'll get two more books done tomorrow night and then I will finish the remaining two on Saturday.  That will complete my "training."  Everyone was extremely friendly.  Very nice atmosphere to be in.  If you didn't already know, my new job is at Blockbuster.  I am very excited to be working again and it doesn't hurt to make a few bucks!  It is part time.  This week I have about 20 hours.  I brought home two movies tonight to watch.  One of the perks to the job is getting 5 free rentals per week.  We watched 13 going on 30 tonight.  Good movie.  I recommend it.  It is definately a chick flick though!  Another perk to the job is that I can "check out" movies before they even come available to the general public.  Pretty cool!
