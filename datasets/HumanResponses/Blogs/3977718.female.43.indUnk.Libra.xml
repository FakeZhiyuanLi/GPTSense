      Was sitting here reading some of my emails tonight and ran across this one it was so damn funny. It really made me laugh my ass off &nbsp;and these days thats doing something. Here it is worlds funniest love letter:&nbsp; Dear Connie, I know the counsellor said that we should not contact each other during our "cooling off" period, but I couldn't wait anymore. The day you left, I swore that i would never talk to you again. But that was just the wounded little boy in me talking. Still, I never wanted to be the first to make contact. In my fantasies, it was always you who would come crawling back to me. I guess my pride needed that. But now I see that my pride has cost me a lot of things. I'm tired of pretending that I don't miss you. I don't care about looking bad anymore. I don't care who maakes the first move as long as one of us does. Maybe it's time we let our hearts speak as loudly as our hurt. And this is what my heart says "There is no one like you Connie." I look for you in the breasts and eyes of every woman I see, but the are not you! They are not even close! Two weeks ago, I met this girl at a bar and bought her home with me. I don't say this to hurt you, but just to illustrate the depth of my desperation. She was young, maybe 19, one of those perfect bodies that only youth can give you. I mean, just a perfect body. Tits like you wouldn't believe and an ass that just would not quit. Every mans dream,right? But as I sat on the couch being blown by this stunner, I thought, look at all the stuff we have we have made important in our lives. It's so superficial! Does it make her better in bed? Well, in this case, yes, but but you see what I'm getting at. Does it make her a better person? Does she have a better heart than my moderately attractive Connie? I doubt it. and I have never really thought about it before. Maybe I'm growing up a litle. Later after I had tossed her about half a pint of throat yoghurt, I found myself thinking,"Why do I find myself feeling so drained and empty?" It wasn't just her flawless technique or her shamless slutty hunger, but something else. Some nagging feeling of loss.Why did I feel so incomplete? And then it hit me. It didn't feel the same because you weren't there to watch. Do you know what I mean? Nothing feels the same without you. Jesus, Connie I'm going crazy without you. And everything I do justs reminds me of you. Do you remember connie, that single mum that we met at the Holiday Inn last year? Well she dropped by last week with a lasagne. She said she figured I wasn't eating right without a woman around. I didn't know what she meant till later, but thats not the real story. Anyway we had a few glasses of wine and the next thing you know we are banging away in our bedroom.. And this tart is a total monster in the sack. She is giving me everything, you know, like a real woman does whenshe is not hung up about her weight or her career and whether the kids can hear us. And all of a sudden, she spots that old mirror on your grandmothers old vanity. So she puts it on the floor and we straddle it, right, so that we can watch ourselves. And it's totaly hot, but it makes me sad, too. Because I can't help thinking, "why didn't Connie ever put the mirror on the floor? We've had this vanity fo what, 14 years, and we never used it as a sex toy. Saturday your sister drops by with the copy or the restraining order. I mean, Josie's just a kid and all, but she's got a pretty good head on her shoulders and she has been e real freind during this painful time. She's given me lots of good advice about you and women in general. She's pulling for us to get back together, Connie, she really is. So we are doing jello shots in the hot tub and talking about happier times. Here's this teenage girl with the same DNA as you and all I canthink about is how much she looks like you when you were 18. And that just about makes me cry. And then it turns out that Josie's really into the whole anal thing, that gets me to thinking about how many times I pressured you about trying it and how that probably fuelled some of the bitterness between us. But do you see even then, when I am thrusting inside your sisters cinnamon ring, all I can do is think of you! It's true Connie! In your heart you must know it. Don't you think we could start over? Just wipe out all the grievances and start fresh? I think we can. If you feel the same way please, please let me know! Otherwise, can you let me know where the fuckin' remote is! Love, Dan.

      I have found out one thing about life and people don't trust them. You can only trust yourself and if you are like me sometimes you don't do that. lol I totally trusted one man in my life and boy was that a mistake. 5 years into our marriage he found him a younger woman, but the surprise was on him. He has to live with her now. lmao. I hope the fucker has a good life, cause he lost alot when he left, a wife that loved him very much 2 beautiful girls that adored him, a step daughter that thought more of him than she did her on father. But guess what FUCK HIM we don't need him. Because of you i will never trust again and i have found out that is best. This makes me think of a song i really like that  makes me think of you. BY EAMON Fuck It "I DON'T WANT YOU BACK" FUCK YOU BEN!

      Sometimes i wonder why we bother with getting serious. It seems to fuck things up when you do, when things are going great then wam, there you are fucked up. One always wanting to know exactly what the other is doing or what they have done. You seem to lose all trust in each other. I trusted one man in my life and where did it get me no where excpt heartache. He left me for a younger woman . Sometimes i wonder what went wrong, what did i do, what could i have done different. But why bother whats done is done. Fuck it&nbsp;it doesn't matter anymore. I hope he is happy for screwing up all our lives because that is what he has done. You know i really loved him but never again will he cause me the pain he has. Today i will forget you for a while. FUCK YOU

      That very first night we talked on the phone,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never knew then I'd never be alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're always with me even when we're apart,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because you take up so much room inside my heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You look past all my flaws as if they were not there,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You've helped me through so much because you truly care,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I start to wonder what fate has in store for me,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look into your eyes, where the future I can see.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even as we grow old, one thing will remain the same,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the love we share will still burn a passionate flame.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've had our ups and downs, yet our love proves strong,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as we have each other, nothing can go wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I close my eyes, I see your loving face,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when I go to sleep, I dream of your embrace.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When things look bad and life goes astray,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You always know just what to say.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we pull each other close and hold each other tight,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You tell me that you love me and make everything all right

      FUNNY JOKE - Daddys Rules Of Dating Rule One:If you pull into my driveway and honk you"d better be delivering a package, because you"re sure not picking anything up. Rule Two:You do not touch my daughter in front of me. You may glance at her, so long as you do not peer at anything below her neck. If you cannot keep your eyes or hands off of my daughter"s body, I will remove them. Rule Three:I am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age to wear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off their hips. Please don"t take this as an insult, but you and all of your friends are complete idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open minded about this issue, so I propose this compromise: You may come to the door with your underwear showing and your pants ten sizes too big, and I will not object. However, in order to ensure that your clothes do not, infact come off during the course of you date with my daughter, I will take my electric nail gun and fasten your trousers securely in place to your waist. Rule Four:I"m sure you"ve been told that in today"s world, sex without utilizing a "Barrier method" of some kind can kill you. Let me elaborate, when it comes to sex, I am the barrrier, and I will kill you. Rule Five:It is usually understood that in order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about sports, politics, and other issues of the day. Please do not do this. The only information I require from you is an indication of when you expect to have my daughter safely back at my house, and the only word I need from you on this subject is: "early" Rule Six:I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities to date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you will continue to date no one but her until she is finished with you. If you make her cry, I will make you cry. Rule Seven:As you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my daughter to appear, and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to be on time for the movie, you should not be dating. My daughter is putting on her makeup, a process than can take longer than painting the Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why don"tyou do something useful, like changing the oil in my car? Rule Eight:The following places are not appropriate for a date with my daughter: Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a wooden tool. Places where there is darkness. Places where there is dancing, holding hands, or happiness. Places where the ambient temperature is warm enough to introduce my daughter to wear shorts, tank tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything other than overalls, a sweater, and a goose down parka - zipped up to her throat. Movies with a strong romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which features chain saws are okay. Hockey games are okay. Old folks homes are better. Rule Nine:Do not lie to me. I may appear to be a potbellied, balding, middle-aged, dimwitted has-been. But on issues relating to my daughter, I am the all-knowing, merciless god of your universe. If I ask you where you are going and with whom, you have one chance to tell me the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I have a shotgun, a shovel, and five acres behind the house. Rule Ten:Be afraid,. Be very afraid. It takes very little for me to mistake the sound of your car in the driveway for a chopper coming in over a rice paddy near Hanoi. When my Agent Orange starts acting up, the voices in my head frequently tell me to clean the guns as I wait for you to bring my daughter home. As soon as you pull into the driveways you should exit the car with both hands in plain sight. Speak the perimeter password, announce in a clear voice that you have brought my daughter home safely and early, then return to your car - there is no need for you to come inside. The camoflaged face at the window is mine.

      Today i am very sad about my grandmother they tell us she doesn't have long to live less than a month. I was her second grandchild and her first grandaughter always her favorite and she was mine. I hate to lose her now but i don't want to see her suffer with this cancer she has. I love her very much but i know when god is ready she will be gone. I dread that day for i know it will be very hard for us to take. I will miss her very much as i do now. I know she has had a long life but i hate to see her go. i can't seem to go see her since they told me she only has less than a month to live. It has been 3 weeks now but i can't look her in the face right now. I know i have to face this soon , i just hope i can before she is gone. I want to tell her how much i love her and how i will miss her when she's gone. But i don't know how to do this right now. I pray she doesn't leave this world before i do, but right now i just can't look her in the eyes. I want her to know so bad but i can't and i don't know why. I love you mamow forever and ever....

      Today i think about my baby sister who i love very much and thank god he did not take her away from us 1 year ago today. All day today that is all i could think about, it is so clear in my mind that tragic day. I thought i would die when i got that call from mom to get to the hospital because she may not be alive she had shot herself in the chest with her 38. To this day i don't understand why you knew we loved you so. I know you had alot on you but never do that again. God i can not imagine going through that again. When i finally got mom & dad and the rest of us to the hospital we didn't know if you were alive and god that was so hard, because we knew you were dead in the yard. Dad was beside himself and didn't want to live if you had died, he felt it was his fault for what you had done. Mom seem to be holding up real good but i worried about her so much i just knew she was going to break at anytime. But she didn't because she knew in her heart you would be ok. But i didn't god i knew we were going to lose you. You were in intensive care for over a month and  i didn't think i could take it. When the doctor told me you were going to die i almost lost it i couldn't believe my ears i just knew we couldn't lose you, i couldn't take it. I had to have janiece and tammy go in and let the doctor tell them because i could not believe what i had heard. But still moms faith was strong and she would not give in to that, she knew you would live. And today 1 year later i thank god he saw fit to leave you in our lives. Please  julie  talk to us and never do this again. We all love you with all our hearts. Your Big Sister. JOYCE

      Today i think about my best friend we met Jan.30,1978 3 days after i married and moved to memphis and we still remain friends today. We have been through so many things together we have seen alot of rough time from lost loves, broken marriages, death of a child , lost friendship but not forgotten. Somehow through it all we would find each again and i thank god for that everyday. I do not know what i would have done without her in my life she is just like a sister to me. We were so young 17 when we met and i will never forget that day. And so much trouble did we get into. I look back on it now and laugh my ass off. We were so damn crazy. We loved to party, we drank a little or alot according to how you looked at it. We love to go to the bars and fuck with people, nothing like getting drunk and getting into a couple of fights. Hell we enjoyed the hell out of it. Then we would go riding that fucking horse of hers( that didn't like me) son-of-a-bitch would through me off but i would get back on. We didn't do a lot of smoking or drugs but when we did it was halarious, going down winchester one night smoking a big one we took from my husband and i told her i just didn't understand why people gotso freaked out and lost when they smoked. All at once we looked up and we were lost going in a different direction than what we started out. We were laughing so damn hard it was so fucking funny. We have had so many good times together and it has helped us through the bad times. Our lives have changed so much over the years. We both have children and grandchildren now we are growing old but at least we are growing old together. No one has ever stood by me as she has and  I love her with all my heart. I do not believe there could ever be a friendship more true than we have together. I will love you forever Janiece till the day i die. I know that day may not be far away and how we will handle that i do not know, for i am the selfish one so you know i hope i go first. Despite my love for you i know you are the stronger one and you will be ok because you have my family to help and remind you of me but i would have nothing, nothing at all but the memories of our wonder life together as best friends for life. I am sorry i am so selfish about this one thing in our lives but that is how it is and how it will stay. so unless we die together i'm sorry i have to go first. For the truest friendship in the world i thank you and i will love you for eternity. YOUR BESTEST FRIEND IN THE WORLD> JOYLEE

      Today i think about my first born( Heather) she is so beautiful i will never forget the day i found out i was pregnant with her. Me ,my husband, and his brother were at the doctors office and when i came out and told them i was pregnant they started yelling. All the way out of the office they both kept yelling we're having a baby ( note WE'RE) so needless to say everyone was looking at them funny, like who's the father&nbsp;it was so funny. Even going down the road they were hanging out of the can yelling. I though they would never stop. I had a very easy pregnancy and on sept. 25,1980 Heather was born. She was great the best baby and i loved her so much. Her father and i were together 10 years when we divorced. We were young when we married and it didn't last. We are friends now and i am proud of that he is a good man. Heather has always been a good kid and never gave me any trouble. She has 2 children of her own now but one thing that bothers me is that she is following in my footsteps and i don't like that. She is in the middle of a divorce after 4 years of marriage. They have been together since they were in the 8th grade and i really hate to see them divorce. They have 2 beautiful children and i wish they could work things out. I pray for them each day that somehow they will work this out for themselves and the kids. I don't know why Heather and i can't seem to get along these days but we don't and that hurts me so bad. I know i am rough on her and always have been. I hurt her feelings so bad sometimes, but it is that i want the best for her. I just want her to do the right things and make those kids happy. I don't want her to be like me and end up so unhappy. Please Heather try to see that i love you more than anything in this world and only want whats best for you. I am sorry for all the fights we have been having lately. I love you baby, forever. MOMMY

      My daughter Jordan there are lots of things i could say about her. She is wonderful such a beautiful girl, mommys baby growing up so quick. I really makes me want to cry. Jordan was my second child and a surprise to me. I had a daughter that was 14 by then and really didn't think i would have any more children and then her father came along. I was very much in love with him and she was the result of that love. A love that is now gone for good because of his infidelity. Jordan was 5 at the time and was hurt very deeply because of him. She talks to me about it sometimes and tells me everything she remembers and it breaks my heart to see her in so much pain because of him. She is 9 now and i hope one day she can forgive him as i try very hard to do. She will be ok one day i know she will because she is strong like her mother. She is a beautiful child and so smart. Baby i love you with all my heart please be ok for mommy. Everything will be ok oneday i promise. I love you baby! MOMMY

      Today i think about my little girl Taylor and when i do&nbsp;boy to the wheels in my mind roll. God i love her so much and can't even think of what i would do without her. She is my child that gives me the most trouble. She is so much like me it is not even funny. She is so stubborn and determened to have her way. One minute she is so damn sweet the next she is telling you off. Sometimes i really don't know what to do with her. She is my little fighter, she takes up for her sister(who is 9) and her brother( 3 ) when someone does or says something to them. My niece ( 12) is bad to pick on my nine year old but i don't have to worry because Taylor ties into her like a wild cat. LOL I think alot of her temper comes for my divorce from her father and her not seeing him very often. She really gets pissed when she talks about him. He only lives 5 miles from them and they only see him a few times a year. And they hardly ever talk to him on the phone and that really gets her. He always has an excuse when they want to go to his house. It has really gotten bad since he adopted his wifes son who is 9. She tells me he doesn't love her because he has a little boy now. I try to tell her he does, but the thing his i really don't think he does. One day he will regret what he has done to them and to himself. I just wish he could make time for them and make them feel they are loved. But one thing she does know is that her mommy loves her very much. I Love You Taylor very much, MOMMY

      I ran into a stranger as he passed by, "Oh excuse me please" was my reply. He said, "Please excuse me too; I wasn't watching for you." We were very polite, this stranger and I. We went on our way and we said good-bye. But at home a different story is told, How we treat our loved ones, young and old. Later that day, cooking the evening meal, My son stood beside me very still. When I turned, I nearly knocked him down. "Move out of the way," I said with a frown. He walked away, his little heart broken. I didn't realize how harshly I'd spoken. While I lay awake in bed, God's still small voice came to me and said, "While dealing with a stranger, common courtesy you use, but the family you love, you seem to abuse. Go and look on the kitchen floor, You'll find some flowers there by the door. Those are the flowers he brought for you. He picked them himself: pink, yellow and blue. He stood very quietly not to spoil the surprise, you never saw the tears that filled his little eyes." By this time, I felt very small, And now my tears began to fall. I quietly went and knelt by his bed; "Wake up, little one, wake up," I said. "Are these the flowers you picked for me?" He smiled, "I found 'em, out by the tree. I picked 'em because they're pretty like you. I knew you'd like 'em, especially the blue." I said, "Son, I'm very sorry for the way I acted today; I shouldn't have yelled at you that way." He said, "Oh, Mom, that's okay. I love you anyway." I said, "Son, I love you too, and I do like the flowers, especially the blue." FAMILY Are you aware that if we died tomorrow, the company that we are working for could easily replace us in a matter of days. But the family we left behind will feel the loss for the rest of their lives. And come to think of it, we pour ourselves more into work than into our own family, an unwise investment indeed, don't you think? So what is behind the story? Do you know what the word FAMILY means? FAMILY = (F)ATHER (A)ND (M)OTHER (I) (L)OVE (Y)OU

        We wonder why they leave us Why they have to die. We have all these questions  We always wonder why! I'm glad that I love them  I think you will agree.  All the pain and grief is worth it To have them as family! The choice isn't ours To this we must adjust. Remember - we are in His hands In Him we must trust! Although we get lonely,  We have to travel on down the road. God is always there to help us Carry our heavy load! We wonder why they have been taken Why we have been left behind. For everything there is a reason Comfort from this shall we find! If we give our words in prayer And we walk through out this land. We will never be alone For He gives us His Helping Hand!

        What would you do if you were told, "You only have six months to live!" Would you ever lose hope of beating those odds? Would you ever laugh or smile again? Would you pray to God above you, To take you or to let you stay? Would you value your life a little more? Would you be thankful for each new day? Would you reach out to others,  And let them comfort you? Or would you stay deep within yourself,  As some people often do? What would you want to be remembered for?  What have you done with your life?  Would you try to change it all now, Or would you know, you have lived right?  Does it really matter,  how many days we live?  Isn't what really matters,  how we live our days? Think About It While there's still time to change your ways!

      School starts tomorrow thank god, i love them but damn this has been a long summer. We really had a good day yesterday though we went to the park and stayed all day we had a picnic, made snow cones, played in the lake, the kids had so much fun, we all did. I wish i had more time and felt like doing things with them. I know i will miss them again this year during school because i don't get to see them except on weekends. Working night makes it hard on them i know but thats the way it has to be right now. Jordan is going to the 4th grade this year and i know she will do fine she is so smart. Taylor is going to the first she is a mess just know i will have trouble with her this year she gets bored so easy. Maybe she will do ok. They are growing up so quick and i really hate that sometimes.

          A friend is someone who will bail you out of jail. A best friend is the one sitting beside you saying, 'Damn that was fun. True friends are the siblings God forgot to give us.The best friend you can have is one you can sit on the porch with and not say a word, then get up and feel like that was the best conversation you've ever had. I'll always be beside you until the very end, wiping all your tears away, being your best friend. I'll smile when you smile and feel all the pain you do, and if you cry a single tear, I promise I'll cry too. I asked God for a flower, and He gave me a garden. I asked Him for a tree amd He gave me a forest. I asked Him for a river and He gave me an ocean. I asked God for a friend and He gave me.."JANIECE" Friends can help each other. A true friend is someone who lets you have total freedom to be yourself--and especially to feel, or not feel. Whatever you happen to be feeling at the moment is fine with them. That's what real love amounts to--letting a person be what they really are." A true friend is someone who reaches for your hand and touches your heart. If you haven't already made me what I am, you've made me what I'll be! How long we will be friends?Let me see....as long as stars twinkle in the sky...as long as angels are there up high...'til oceans run dry...and 'til the day I die. We weren't born sisters at birth but fate knew from the start we were meant to be sisters by heart. A good friend is like a computer: she Enters your life, Saves you in his heart, Formats your problems, and never Deletes you from her Memory. I was able to walk on fire, I was able to climb the highest mountain, I was able to perform the most impossible tasks, only because through every hard trial, you were there holding my hand. 'Cause you truly are my special friends. You will always be my best friend, you know too much. heehee. The miracle of friendship speaks from one heart to another, listens for unspoken needs, recognizes secret dreams, and understands the silent things. This is a message from me to you, to make sure you never forget I love you! When things are rough and you feel lost, just call on me and I'll be there at any cost. I'll do this because I care for you, I'll stick by your side no matter what you do. I am your friend through thick and thin, just as, for me, you have always been. A true friend is always be there when the whole world left you, she always cheers you up when the whole world has turned you down and she never asks you to act like an angel but she becomes your angel. If you're upset, call me. I won't guarentee I'll make you laugh but I can cry with you. If you ever feel like you need to run away, call me. I won't guarentee I'll persuade you to stay but I can run with you. But, if one day you call and there's no answer....I might need you. A friend comforts you when you are down, supports you when you struggle, and celebrates when you succeed. But a BEST friend feels pain when you are hurt and holds you as you cry together, walks with you every step as you struggle, and rejoices with you at every success. Nations will rise and fall. Wars will be lost and won. Lives will begin and end, but a true friend is eternal. Memories last forever, never do they die. Friends stay together, never say goodbye. A friend is a crutch when you're falling apart; a friend is a pillar when you have a broken heart. A friend is a treasure without knowing why; a friend holds you together and won't let you cry. Friendship opens many doors, each with a different view, but none could be more welcome than the door that leads to you. What is a friend? A friend is two people sharing one soul. And that friend is you Janiece. FRIENDS FOREVER!!!!!!!!! joylee

      When i think of my mom lots of things go through my mind. Happiness, saddness, rage, sorrow, so many emotions. She is a very good woman but has one problem we have had to deal with for 35 years and drives us all crazy. My mom has from time to time had a prescription drug problem and one day it is going to kill her i know. I know it is very hard for her but she has got to stop before it is to late. She is 63 years old now and not looking good at all. When she doesn't take the drugs she looks so good, she doesn't even look like she is 63. I hope one day she will stop i don't want anything to happen, but what can you do. We have talked to her about it. We have begged her, got pissed and yelled at her but nothing does any good. I worry all the time what will happen. Every time they call me at work i just know someone is going to tell me she is dead. She has fell and hurt herself so bad so many times. I wonder week to week if this is the week she will stay in bed so messed up she can't move. My mom is a good woman with a bad problem and i pray god will help her with this. We have done all we can and i am at the end of my rope. She has always been a great cook couldn't ask for better. She has always taken care of us all and her grandchildren. She has helpped me raise my kids since the day they were born. And i hate for them to grow up without her. She was always home with us as kids she didn't work so she was home cleaning, cooking, washing always busy doing things for us untill the drugs would step in. Then we just had to wait it out and hope she would be ok and not get hurt. We just pray for her and hope one day she will win this battle and live and love. We were very lucky to have my parents together all these years they have been married 47 years . They have made it through alot of hard times with her drugs and all the problems 5 kids have put them through and the loss of one child, something my mom has never gotten over. God i pray for her today and everyday that you will help her with her drug problem.........

      Went to my grandmothers yesterday and it was very sad to sit and look at her knowing she was going to die soon. Haven't been in 3 weeks and god what a change, she looks so frail, so small. I am glad i finally went even though we didn't talk about it but is was on all our minds. I did manage to tell her i loved her very much and give her a big hug. She didn't want to let go and it broke my heart to look into her eyes, just knowing  her days with us were few. God i love her and will miss her so. I am thanful for having a grandmothe like her. She will be gone soon and another part of my life will be gone forever. Wish i could have talked to about dying but so many people were around and i was so afraid of crying. Thats one thing i do not want her to see me do. I know she is very scared right now and i want to talk to her about that. I hope to see her again soon and maybe we can spend some time alone to talk. I really want her to know how muck i love her and will miss her so. I love you so much mamaw...........

      Finally coming out of this crazy depression i've been in and it feels so damn good. Feel a little normal today for a change, thank god. Got off work early tonight and reading my emails and here it was, something that made me laugh my ass off.     MY FIRST TIME.                                                                                      Don't jump to conclusions now... My First Time The sky was darkthe moon was high all alone just her and I Her hair so soft her eyes so blue I knew just what she wanted to do Her skin so soft her legs so fine I ran my fingers down her spine I didn't know how but I tried my best to place my hand on her breast I remember my fear my fast beating heart but slowly she spread her legs apart And when she did I felt no shame as all at once the white stuff came At last it was finished it's all over now,my first time...milking a cow.

      Today i think of him and what i've done to us both a friendship lost because of me. I knew i should have kept my feelings to myself, but i made a very bad mistake and screwed things up as usually. we really did have a friendship that could have lasted a life time but it's gone. I know deep down we can never be the same. He will never be able to talk to me , to joke with me, to laugh with me, because in the back of his mind it will always be there (my feelings for him). I really fucked things up and i am so sorry. Why couldn't i have left things alone i was so happy to have him as a friend. Now i have to go on with life without him. Will i ever learn to keep things to myself.

      "My World" I'm in a world of darkness, No one can see a thing.I'm wearing my emotions, With no one noticing. I'm in a world of silence, There's not a single sound. And though I lie here screaming, You all just walk around. I'm in a world of numbness, No one can feel at all. A million knifes stab through me, I topple and I fall.I'm trapped within this hell pit,I'm all alone in here. I'm drownding in the darkness. I'm dying in the fear.

      "Emotions" ext. version Why must you fucking make me feel, After I've hid for all these years. I don't even know how to deal, Emotions are my worst of fears. Trust? I know naught but betrayal.Betrayed by everyone but you. Were I to tell you how I feel-Would you be a betrayer too? All my life I've hid emotions, I've always been the stoic one. If I trust, I could be broken, And my whole life could be undone. And yet you go and make me feel, After I've hid for all these years. I don't even know how to deal...Emotions are my worst of fears."~~*~~" I catch your eyes across the room, But you know naught of what I feel. I take a step, and you take two, My heart's a flutter-is this real?We've spanned the distance, standing close, And you begin to speak to me. You don't see what I feel for you, My heart says stay, my mind says flee. So smart and funny, can't you tell? You won me over with those eyes. So perfect inside, outside too, My heart is bound with loving ties. Yet you see me as just a friend, And I won't risk e'er losing that. In silence shall my feeling stay, So with a smile I answer back.

      "You" You say that I'm not trying, But it's not me-it's you. I see you fucking crying, The way you always do. You're just looking for pity, Want me to sympathize. But I think it's just shitty, That you blow things out of size. You expect me to stay by you, Forever by your side. With you acting the way you do, I'd rather fucking hide. When you said you'd never hurt me, It was just another lie. So now it's time I leave you, Another bad goodbye.

      "Anywhere"I'm running in circles, Veering out of control. But I'm on a short leash here, So I never get, anywhere. There's a million voices talking, Each of them their own ideas, Don't they know that they're not me? Why oh why can't they just see?Fucking leave me alone!Because I'm running in circles, Veering out of control. But I'm on a short leash here, So I never get, anywhere.Everybody has their own lives, They're always running all around. I'm stuck behind these walls I've made,While they just tell me to behave, Fucking leave me alone!So now I'm running in circles, Veering out of control. My leash is getting ever shorter, I think I'm going to explode. And I will never get, anywhere. I'm not gonna get, anywhere. Still a thousand miles from, anywhere.Anywhere.

      "Dangerous Promise" There you sit, all alone, Lost within your mind. I can't tell what you're thinking, Or what you hope to find. But as you sit there dazing, Within your darkened room, There's one thing that you do not know- The darkness is your doom. All consuming, all concealing, Seems comforting at first. But as your thoughts get trapped inside, Your head is going to burst. Insanity is welcoming, To make your thoughts be still. But all it leaves' an empty shell, You don't know how to fill. So drag yourself out from the dark, And I'll be waiting there. If you need help just call for me, For you, I'll always care.

      "Protected" You're fucking dying inside, No where to run, no where to hide, Nobody cares anymore, Once again, there's another bolted door. There's no one but yourself to blame, They have all tried, but your still the same, No matter what they may do. So once again, they've all given up on you. You're always all alone, Never open up your shell. They're always asking you, But you know you'll never tell. There's only so much, Anyone will even try. So now alone again, With another hopeless sigh.

      "Cry for Help" Turmoil. Chaos. The confusion sinks in. These thoughts that, I'm having, a horrible sin. So many, decisions, each with their own end. But none of, it matters, my mind just won't mend... I'm so lost. In a cage. If you ask me what I'm thinking, Just another empty page. No one can, Even tell. So I guess I'm stuck here dying, In another living hell. Destruction. The fire. It burns all in sight. But no one, notices, it happens at night. Ignore it. Deny it. It may go away. So screaming, at night and, pretending by day. I'm so lost. In a cage. If you ask me what I'm thinking, Just another empty page. No one can, Even tell. So I guess I'm stuck here dying, In another living hell. Why can't I, Ever tell? Forever I'll be dying, In another living hell.

      This week i lost a friend who was very close to my heart and somehow i wish i could turn back time and change what i have done. But how do i do that i really do not know. If he could see inside my heart he would know how sorry i am for what i have done. Things happened so fast and i really did not try. It just happened, my heart opened up to him when it should have remained closed. I tried so hard not to see him as i did , but i saw something inside him i had never seen before that drew me to him. Some how i wish i could have turned the other way but my heart would not let me. My world came crashing down on me once again and as usual i did not handle it well. And now i pay the ultimate price. One day i know he will forgive me for all these crazy things i've done. Please lord help him to forgive me for what i've done.

      Confessions Of A Broken Heart  Pain... Tension... Fatigue...Depression...Anger, Aggression, Frustration. All these unwanted sensations -Burning, hurting, tearing.My heart alone, cold and fearing.Why won't you let me sleep, let me rest, Let me forget To eradicate, eliminate, destroy all my regrets? These memories inside, swirling, twirling, unwilling to reside in the corner of my mind. Repeating, resisting, insisting -Refusing to be denied its recognition of its position in myFrustration, Confusion, Delusion. Ah, to close my eyes and let time fly by, Because there's so much to gain by forgetting these dreams driving me insane. Unfocused, unclear, out of control,My world spinning, spinning, spinning, My sanity flying through the door. My reason, my logic, oh, it's tragic,Like fine sands running through my hands,I'm losing my mind.

      I&nbsp;said goodbye to you tonight and it was the hardest thing i ever did but with the way you feel i know it is what i had to do. I will close my heart again to any happiness that might come along for i am hurt once again. I will put that freaking wall back up so no one will come back in for i never want to feel that way again. I prayed for us each night as i went to bed but god must forgive me once again. Because once again i am weak and can not wait for him to give me the strength to handle this with you or the answers i really need. I am very sorry if i hurt you with this but if it is any comfort to you i hurt myself even more than you. For some reason i really thought there was a chance for us but again i was wrong. I hope you will find the happiness you so deserve and could not find with me. I will miss you forever and hold you close to my heart.

      This poem is to my friend Jeff. The only man who has been able to pierce through this heart in the past 5 years. And what good does it do me, none for he is not ready for anything deep. Because of his own pain and heart ache caused by someone else. If he only knew what was in my heart i think i could get him to see it is better to forget her and go on with life, as i am trying to do. I need him to feel as i do , i need him in my life so bad. why god does there have to be this damn wall so high not even i can reach. Maybe one day i will. Opened Heart by Janis Jensen  You are like no other, And this I know its true, For my heart finds something special, and it has chosen you. My heart has chosen to open up and let you deep inside, piercing through my wall, putting all its fears aside. My heart is actually beating now and it's because of you. For everything you say and everything you do. This poem is to tell you that you mean a lot to me, and you are in my heart for all eternity.

      The Thief Of My Heart Author: Lourdes S.  Like a thief in the night  you entered And robbed me, And stole my heart,  You made me feel more love, Then I've ever felt, And more happiness Than I've ever dreamed,  I will go to the ends of the earth if you need,  As I never thought dreams, Could come true, Yet you have showed me that they do, When you came and,  robbed my heart,  As I gaze into your eyes,  My spoken words, cannot express, The love I have for you, I just never knew All the things I was missing, From this life of mine, When you stepped in, And like a thief  you robbed my heart, and soul. Then I opened my eyes  and everything, Began to shine,  No one else has ever,  Touch my soul, like you did, Or found, my hidden heart,  Only you...For you are the thief of my heart, And now my heart will always be yours...  if only yours was mine.

      Today i&nbsp;think about&nbsp;him but after talking to him today i know deep in my heart i will lose him one day. He is in love with another woman and will never get over her. He sits and hopes for her to come back into his life. And what do i do, i sit here was wish i could be in&nbsp;his life and it hurts&nbsp; to know i never will. I sit and wonder why she doesn't want him and how lucky i would feel if he wanted me as he does her. She doesn't realize what she thrown away. 5 years ago i shut myself out from the world and any happiness it might have for me. Because i never wanted to be hurt again and again i made the mistake and let my heart open up to someone. I never realized he could not&nbsp;care me as i do him&nbsp;and never would. I know that now and i wonder why i let myself do this again. God why did i think he could love me. Why did i think anyone could, i knew before i let this happen but somehow i thought it would be different. I know he is kind and sweet and i know he did not set out to hurt me but&nbsp;it has . I know he would not&nbsp; have let it go this far if he had know this would happen.&nbsp;I do not blame him for what has happened to me through this. I do hope that one day&nbsp;he can forgive me for letting this go&nbsp;so far.&nbsp;I can thank god for the small bit of happiness i had with him. I will cherish the time we had together and hold on to the memory of him forever. &nbsp;I can not be sorry for my feeling for him because i did&nbsp;care so much for him. He will be in my heart forever. Maybe one day when i am over this i can handle talking to him without messing things up. Maybe one day we can be friends and talk and laugh together without me getting so serious.&nbsp; Jeff i will hold you in my heart forever.

       HOW YOU MAKE ME FEEL Author: Julia Erdan When I am wrapped up in your arms, I feel safer than ever before. When you stare into my eyes,  its a feeling I can't ignore. I know this isn't just a game, because, what I feel for you, I never felt with anyone else. When I am close to you  I am overwhelmed with happiness. You're what I've been waiting for my whole life. You're someone I can share my love with, you take away my fears. Words can't express how much I love you. But, through this short amount of time, I hope you realize that my love for you is real. I'm not with you to play games, and I know you feel the same. With you, is where I want to be  because I found someone who loves me just for me You give me all the reason in the world  to believe that you won't hurt me in anyway.  And if I ever lost you, I don't know what I would do. You probably think I am crazy, but truthfully I'm not. Every time that were together, it's a whole new experience for me. All I see in this world, is no one else but you and me.

      Today is a blue day for me i have so many things on my mind right now. Why can't life be simple for us, that is all i want. My friend comes back from seattle tomorrow and i really don't know where we will go from here. After the way i have acted and the things i have said will he run the other way or will he understand that i am confussed and scared of what i am feeling right now. Things are happening to me right now that i just don't understand and don't know how to deal with. Why can't  i  just take things in stride and go on living as if nothing were different. But  things are so different now, why can't he see inside my heart and know that i am so scared of losing him. And that i need him in my life so bad right now. I need him to put his arms around me and tell me things will be ok.   He has a personality that just pulls you in and holds you there. He can make you laugh with just a couple of words. He puts a smile on your face when you don't really want to smile and his smile , well it is etched in my mind forever. Just to be around him or talk to him brings me up and makes me so happy. To hear his voice when he calls me does something to me i can't explain.  I do not know what i will do if i ever lose him. God please let me do the right things so that i do not lose him.

      This water getting too deep to tread I’m losing my grip, getting in over my head I’d give you this breath, just send me on under I’m so wrapped up in all of your wonder My hearts beating faster than it probably should But drowning has never felt so good Im weaker then Ive been willing to say But I’m falling faster every day So scared to be torn and broken again Shaking words bleed from this pen All of my walls, you seem to break through I guess I’m just weak when it comes to you What is this spell that you’ve got me under It swept me up like rolling thunder You’ve got me. Stumbling on words and falling apart. Isnt it obvious? You’ve got my heart.

      2 in the morning and i just got off work sitting here thinking and listening to manhattans, kiss and say boodbye. what a beautiful song.&nbsp;I love music so much i believe i could sit and listen to it every second of the day. There are so many beautiful love songs and great artist in this world. I wonder sometimes how they get these songs out of their heads. They touch so many hearts and lives. They stir up so many emotions in people. I know they do mine anyway. They really make you think about your &nbsp;life and what you have made of it. You know we all do things in our lives that effect so many people. Sometimes i wonder why i do the things i do and why i do not learn from my mistakes. Listening to one song tonight has made me think about one very dear friend of mine. He is so sweet and kind, a wonderful man whom i have grown to care very much for in such a short time. He makes me laugh, he makes me cry, he stirs up so many emotions inside me . Emotions i have not felt in so many years if i ever did&nbsp;and he doesn't even know it. well i think he does but like me he has a wall so damn hi no one can get over it.  &nbsp;  That freaking wall what do we do with it, god why can't we take it down and live our lives and be happy without worrys of the past and what might happen. God i just want to&nbsp;care about &nbsp;him and have him care as much for me.&nbsp;Why can't he understand me and see that i do not want to hurt him in any way. God please give me the strength to be paient and not chase him away for i do care so much for him. I have never felt like this about anyone in my life. To talk to him, to hear his voice when he calls gives me so much peace in my heart. To look into his eyes and see what i see when he is laying next to me, to know he is so kind and gentle. To make love to him is something i can not explain, the feelings that come over me are so wonderful. God what do i do, please tell me!  &nbsp;  all of these things scare the hell out &nbsp;me even though they should make me feel good. God i know one day i will lose him but i will cherish the time we have together and hope that one day we can break through that freaking wall that we both seem to be holding so high. God please give us both the strength to be patient and understanding we need to get through this. Even if it means just being friends. Give him the strenght to look over some of these crazy things that i do , and the insight to see that i really do care so much for him. please don't let him run away from this. I did not mean to fall&nbsp;for&nbsp;him but i did and i can't help that. Please let him see that god. I know he is not ready for it but let him see that there is someone out there who care very much for him.  &nbsp;  I know his life is so different from mine for so many reason, i know he has so many medical problems and his sight is not very good. But god that doesn't matter to me it's what is in the heart that counts. And deep down in my heart i know he is a kind, gentle,&nbsp;loving human being. And i know if we could get over these walls there is a life there for us together. If he could see into my heart right now i know he could&nbsp;care for&nbsp;me as i do him. Because there is a very special place in my heart for him and will be forever no matter what happens to us.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  God to laugh again with him, to make love to him, to look at him, to touch him and have him touch me. what i would do to be happy again. God please let him see that our hearts can be connected&nbsp;even if it is only friends. Don't let us Kiss And Say Goodbye.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I've tried to write these words...so many times before.To say the things that are in my heart...to the man that I adore. My page continues to stare at me...with a blank, empty stare. Too many thoughts cloud my mind... too deep my words to bare. Do I tell him that I love him... in a way not like before? Do I tell him that I need him... each day, more and more? When lieing in his bed at night... does he know that I am there? I'm with him in his day and night dreams...does he know how much I care? Overwhelmed by our passion...we are consumed by our lust... I wonder if he wonders, if his feelings he can trust? Does he know that when he touches me... it nearly drops me to my knees? Does he know what I would do for him... for the sake of wanting to please? I wonder if he senses...the longing that I feel...to see him, touch him, taste him, hold him... to tell him this is real? Now my page is written...these words that bare my soul. Do I tell him what I'm feeling...or does he already know?

      Trying to see what makes this good, But its so hard when all I can find is what I do wrong. I need you in my life, I know and realize this. But controlling myself enough to give in to loving you, Its the hardest thing I have to do. Struggling every day just to overcome this fear, Fear that your someday going to dissappear. Leaving my heart for pain and burden, But I want think you ever would. My mind is telling me to trust you, My heart wants to do the same. But the caution signs are all lit up, Getting ready to point the blame. Its going to take all I have in me, Not to let myself push you away. You are the only one I want to stay, For more than just one day. It gets harder and harder to continue to play. Its so much of a good thing, I fear its never going to stay. Your the perfect thing in my life The one thing I just need. But my heart is telling me dont fall to fast, Otherwise Im just going to bleed. Trying to push down my fears and doubts, All to achieve the one thing I need You, The only thing for me.

      Find the hurt, bind the pain, nothing lost, only gain. pry me from my feelings. find me some new. buying time, living on the stolen. finding ways to keep on going. unknowing of where im going. lost in my world, found in another. hoping the dreams of better days come true. more deserving of my time here with you. knowing i should not be here, standing, wondering why. grasping onto all i can. gasping for my last breath. faded days gone. finally numb to this throbing pain. hold my hands,guide my way, to maybe that better day. where the numbness of this throbing pain finally goes away. guide my body to this place, so i can live without the diar pain. pain of the past. feelings lost over time, sticking to my mind.

      Those who have suffered Understand suffering And therefore extend their hand.  The most I can do for my friends Is simply to be his friend.  Funny things are funny. But funnier When I share them with you.  I can't forgive my friends for dying; I don't find these vanishing acts of theirs very amusing  For every beauty There is an eye Somewhere to see it. For every truth There is an ear Somewhere to hear it. For every love There is a heart Somewhere to receive it  So long as we are loved by others I should say that We are almost indispensable; And no man is useless While he has a friend.  Friendship improves happiness, and abates misery, by doubling our joy, and dividing our grief.  The loss of a friendis  like that of a limb; time may heal the anguish of the wound but the loss cannot be repaired.  A true friend is the gift of God, and he only who made hearts can unite them.  I am not one of those who believes in love at first sight, but I believe in taking a second look.  Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind.

      Well let me tell you about Simon, he is a guy i chat with on-line . He is he sweetest guy you could ever get to know. We met on here long ago and i really don't know where i would be without him. He has been there for me in good times and in bad. He puts up with a lot of shit from me, crying, whining, gettin pissed off, hell i'm surprised he still talks to me. We do have alot of fun together though. Late at night when i get home from work, usually in a bad mood he cheers me up and it doesn't take him long. He is so damn crazy he makes me laugh so damn hard i cry. We talk about everything , our families, who we chat with, work, his wife, my kids, my loves lol ,and oh yes sex we talk alot about that. We get so damn crazy on here he keeps me sane. I really love him to death and hope one day to meet him in person. I chat with alot of people on-line but i believe he is a true friend. I really wish he knew how much he helps me especially when i am down. He makes me pick myself up and wipe it off and go on with life. He always makes me feel good about myself when someone else gets me down. He know all my troubles, believe me he does. He really is the greatest guy you would ever get to know. To my buddy Simon my friend for life, thank you for being my friend and not running out on me when others did. Love ya forever friend.......

      I look up at the stars, and I see your face. Imprinted in the heavens. In everything I know, you've left a trace.  I see your smile in the morning light. And I see your eyes twinkle in the dusky fog of night.  When I look into the sky I see your trancing stare. I look around me, and I see you everywhere.  When you kiss me you taste my tears. You run your fingers through my hair, and you ease my fears.  My today is for you. My tomorrows are for me. I must seek a new love now, you knew we'd never be.  As I close my eyes to sleep, I know you're still the one. You'll only find me now on the dark side of the sun.

      Got this in one of my emails today though it was really cute.  i'm sick of those stupid "friend oaths", who knows friend's like that? here's the real version:  1. When you are sad - I will help get you drunk and plot revenge against the sorry bastard who made you a whiny lil bitch.  2. When you are blue - I will try to dislodge whatever is choking you.  3. When you smile - I will know you finally got laid.  4. When you are scared - I will rag on you about it every chance I get.  5. When you are worried - I will tell you horrible stories about people I know who went through the same thing, which probably won't help much.  6. When you are confused - I will use small words so that I don't hurt your wittle brain.  7. When you are sick - Stay the hell away from me until you are well again. I don't want whatever you have.  8. When you fall - I will point and laugh at your clumsy ass. This is my oath. I pledge it till the end. Why, you may ask?  Because that's what friend's do!

         Wanted so bad,      It's been so long,      A feeling like this,      A feeling so strong.      Late night talks,      Moving so fast ...       We need to slow down,      I want this to last.       Put your trust in me,      And let your feelings go,       I won't let you down      I just want you to know.       We've both been hurt,      It only made us stronger,      Now let's do things right,      And make this last forever.

      Friends may think we have forgotten When at times they see us smile. Little do they know the heartaches, That our smiles hide, all the while. Beautiful memories are wonderful things, That last 'til the longest day. They never wear out, they never get lost, And can never be given away. To some you may be forgotten, To others, a part of the past, But to those who love you and lost you, You memory will always last.

      It costs nothing and is worth a lot. It makes the receiver richer without making the giver poorer. It is as brief as lighting but often lingers in memory forever.Nobody is so rich that he can do without it, and nobody so poor that he cannot afford it. It makes for a happy home, creates goodwill in business & is the sign of friendship.It gives strength to the tired, uplifts the disheartened ,cheers up the sad &amp; is the best remedy against annoyance. It cannot be bought or begged, borrowed or stolen; because it is valuable only when given as a present. And nobody needs it more desperately than someone who has none left for others. And it only takes 15 muscles to do this than to do it'sopposite which takes 65. It only takes one smile to offer welcome... & blessed be the person who will share it. It only takes one moment to be helpful... and blessed be the person who will spare it. It only takes one joy to lift a spirit...&amp; blessed be the person who will give it. It only takes one life to make a difference...&amp; blessed be the person who will live it. THIS IS SO TRUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

       Betrayed by your sweetness,  I only saw what you wanted me to.  wanting you out of loneliness,  not knowing what to do.  my heart is so cold.  im sorry it had to be you.  anger I find twofold .  this cant be true, now I am back to where I started. detached from the earth,  lost from where we parted.  I seek for my worth,  coming up empty handed.  I fear for my future.  but alone I stand, with this fear in my hand.  my loneliness is forever,  that's where i stand.

      Never cry over anyone who wouldn't cry over you. The worst way to miss someone, is to have them sitting right next to you & you know you can never have them again... I hate that you made me laugh, but even more that you made me cry, &amp; I hate the fact that you're not around, I hate that your not mine...but mostly, I hate the fact that I dont hate you at all. I always knew looking back on the tears would make me laugh, But I never knew looking back on the laughs would make me cry. Meeting you was fate,Be coming ur friend was a choice, but falling in love with u was beyond my control. If You Luv Me... Let Me Know... If You Don't... Then Let Me Go....To love is one thing, to be loved is another, but to be loved by the one you love is everything. ...I'd rather be your lover than your friend, but I'd rather be your friend than your nothing. Where can I go to get away from the pain of loving you? Whoever said breakin up was the hard part was wrong, letting go and realizing I will never feel your arms around me is even harder. All I want is for you to know me again, for me to be in your life. And, even if it can't happen right now, I would just like to know that you heard my plea. I would just like to know that I am not blocked from your memory. Where do I go to start all over when in your arms is where I want to be?

      You will never know true happiness until you have truly loved, and you will never understand what pain really is until you have lost it...Crying over someone doesn't bring them back; staying up late at night wishing on stars doesn't make things as they were. Telling them how much you love them doesn't either. The only thing that you can do is let their heart come to you. When someone is born, someone dies, Someone laughs, someone cries, If you love someone let them know,'cause if they leave tomorrow they will never know. Letting go of him isn't giving up, it's accepting that some things aren't meant to be. True love is 8 letters-* _but then again so is_ BULLSHIT. It's strange to think that people can fall in love and out of it again, that love can turn to hate, and that it's the people who loved you most who could hurt you most. I wish life could be as sweet as a F a i r y Ta l e, instead of E n d l e s s D i s s a s t e r s that never seam to end... You -may- forget the friends you * laughed * with, but you will -never- forget the friends you *cried* with. If you love someone, never give them up without a fight. Watching him is hard to forget, loving him is hard to regret, loosing him is hard to accept, but even with all the hurt I have felt, letting go is the most painful yet. You never loose anything. Not really. Things, people- they go away, sooner or later. You can't hold on to them anymore than you can hold the moonlight. But if they've touched you, if they're inside of you, then they're still yours. Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we should know how to be greatfull for that gift. Love comes to those who still hope, even though they've been disappointed, to those who still love even though they've been hurt before. Forget the times that you walked by... Forget the times you made me cry... Forget the times you held my hand... Forget the sweet things if I can...I can no longer pretend...I gotta remember your just my friend. Everyone says to give up on you, but they dont see you like I do. Your the one who broke my heart, your the reason my world fell apart, Your the one who made me cry, yet I still luv you...and i dont know why...I'm gonna smile like nothings wrong, talk like everythings perfect, act like it't just a dream, and pretend he's not hurting me...I've made alot of stupid mistakes in my life, but the biggest mistake was thinking the guy who hurt me the most would never hurt me again. Do I still love you? Of course I still love you. Do I still need you? Maybe... i'm not so sure I dont know if I really need anyone. So I think I'm going to let go now. And I know its going to hurt. I'll still cry myself to sleep every night. But eventually....I won't cry anymore. Maybe I'll even find someone else to love and care about as much as I do for you. Although, I doubt that...The hardest part of walking away from you is knowing you wont run after me...Sometimes you have to let go of something to see if it's really worth holding on to...and sometimes, when you realize it WAS worth holding onto...It's a little too late. .:I didn't ask for it to be over, but I never asked for it to begin...That's the way it is with life, some of the most beautiful days come completely by chance...But even the most beautiful of days have their sunset. Everything changes eventually thats the way life is and you have no control over it. Suddenly people who you think are always gonna be there...disappear...:

      My heart goes out to you, Because deep inside i know, Your heart is just as mine, Lonely,sad and unsure; Now we go through life this way Not knowing what to do, You came into my life that day, Now nothing will ever be the same I opened my heart to you. Something that was very hard to do, I wish now that you could too. For i know deep down inside of me, That there is something there to be. I know your scared and i am too, But i know if you could see in side my heart You could see a heart thats true. In an instant you changed my life I just wish you would give me the chance to do the same for you. Open up your heart to me And find happiness that is true. I know our lives are so different But that doesn't mean a thing to me. Life could be so different for us you see, If you would just open your heart to me. Open up you eyes and see just how things could really be. Please don't run from this today Just open up your heart to me.

      There are many beautiful things deep inside you which this world will never understand nor listen to, for neither has it the time nor the interest to care... but hold on to your peace- that peace which the world cannot give nor take away, that peace so secure that you can speak your truth quietly and clearly. Go through life seeking not so much to be understood and to understand, seeking neither fortune nor fame, illusions as they are, not solutions. Love, that's all there is... keep working on love, for love is your life-mission, your only secure achievement through the years. Remember, you are worth not for what you have, not even for who you are but for what others have become because of you. Every person is worth stopping for. In the thick of the grind sparks & the flashbulbs, don't miss the candleglow... GOD LOVES YOU! Courage! You are far more important than the sparrow...You are loved more than you know. Yes, he is always with you. Be brave. Lifecould sometimes be tough &amp; people mean &amp; uncaring, but always, there will be friends. Every person is a potential friend, you have a sure friend in him, and of course, there's always you, your own best friend! What matters most, in the end, is that you lived a life that is full, beautiful, meaningful and grateful..... so amidst the many trials, difficulties and onslaughts of life, SMILE, don't cry, for the truth is "this world was never meant forone as beautiful as you." (Father Jerry M. Orbos, SVD) I read this somewhere today and though it was worth posting.

      Have you ever had times When you feel that the whole world Is against you? Is against your principles? Is against your beliefs? Have you had times? When all seem wrong never right? The day seems dark? The sky becomes cloudy? The streets becomes muddy? Have you ever felt far, far away? When in truth you were really very near You could have touched the stars You could even sail any storm You could even fight all your fights? Well, my friends, I have and I know That you have too. There are days when i feel like this but some how i make it through.

      To laugh is to risk appearing a fool. To weep is to risk appearing sentimental. To reach out for another is to risk involvement. To expose feelings is to risk exposing your own trueself. To love is to risk rejection.To live is to risk dying.To hope is to risk failure.But risks must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing at all. He may avoid suffering and sorrow, but he cannot learn, feel, change , grow or live. Chained by his certitudes, he is a slave, he has forfeited his freedom. Only a person who risk is free..

      A time comes in your life when you finally get it. When in the midst of all your fears and insanity you stop dead in your tracks and somewhere the voice inside your head cries out - ENOUGH! Enough fighting and crying or struggling to hold on. And, like a child quieting down after a blind tantrum, your sobs begin to subside, you shudder once or twice, you blink back your tears and through a mantle of wet lashes you begin to look at the world through new eyes. This is your awakening. You realize that it's time to stop hoping and waiting for something to change, or for happiness, safety and security to come galloping over the next horizon. You come to terms with the fact that he is not Prince Charming and you are not Cinderella and that in the real world there aren't always fairy tale endings (or beginnings for that matter). and that any guarantee of "happily ever after" must begin with you, and in the process a sense of serenity is born of acceptance. You awaken to the fact that you are not perfect, and that not everyone will always love, appreciate or approve of who or what you are and its OK. (They are entitled to their own views and opinions.) And you learn the importance of loving and championing yourself, and in the process a sense of newly found confidence is born of self-approval. You stop bitching and blaming other people for the things they did to you (or didn't do for you) and you learn that the only thing you can really count on is the unexpected. You learn that not everyone will always be there for you, and that it's not always about you. So, you learn to stand on your own and to take care of yourself and in the process a sense of safety and security is born of self-reliance. You stop judging and pointing fingers, and you begin to accept people as they are, and to over look their shortcomings and human frailties and in the process a sense of peace and contentment is born of forgiveness. You realize that much of the way you view yourself, and the world around you, is a result of all the messages and opinions that have been ingrained into your psyche. And you begin to sift through all the crap you've been fed about how you should behave, how you should look, how much you shouldn't weigh, what you should wear, where you should shop, what you should drive, how and where you should live, what you should do for a living, who you should sleep with, who you should marry, what you should expect of a marriage, the importance of having and raising children, or what you owe your parents. You learn to open up to new worlds and different points of view. And you begin reassessing and redefining who you are and what you really stand for. You learn the difference between wanting and needing, and you begin to discard the doctrines and values you've outgrown, or should never have bought into to begin with, and in the process you learn to go with your instincts. You learn to distinguish between guilt and responsibility, and the importance of setting boundaries and learning to say NO. You learn that the only cross to bear is the one you choose to carry, and that martyrs get burned at the stake. Then you learn about love. Romantic love and familial love. How to love, how much to give in love, when to stop giving, and when to walk away. You learn not to project your needs or your feelings onto a relationship. You learn that you will not be more beautiful, more intelligent, more lovable, or important because of the man or woman on your arm or the child that bears your name. You learn to look at relationships as they really are and not as you would have them be. You stop trying to control people, situations, and outcomes. You learn that just as people grow and change, so it is with love. and you learn that you don't have the right to demand love on your terms. Just to make you happy. And, you learn that 'alone' does not mean lonely. And you look in the mirror and come to terms with the fact that you will never be a size 5 or a perfect 10 and you stop trying to compete with the image inside your head and agonizing over how you "stack up." You also stop working so hard at putting feelings aside, smoothing things over, and ignoring your needs. You learn that feelings of entitlement are perfectly OK. . . and that it is your right to want things that you want. and that sometimes it is necessary to make demands. You come to the realization that you deserve to be treated with love, kindness, sensitivity, and respect, and you will not settle for less. And you allow only the hands of a lover who cherishes you, to glorify you with his or her touch. and in the process you internalize the meaning of self-respect. And you learn that your body really is your temple. You begin eating a balanced diet, drinking more water, and taking more time to exercise. You learn that fatigue diminishes the spirit and can create doubt and fear, so you take more time to rest. And, just as food fuels the body, laughter fuels our soul, so you take more time to laugh and to play. You learn that, for the most part, in life you get what you believe you deserve. and that much of life is a self-fulfilling prophecy. You learn that anything worth achieving is worth working for, and that wishing for something to happen is different from working toward making it happen. More importantly, you learn that in order to achieve success, you need direction, discipline, and perseverance. You also learn that no one can do it all alone and its OK to risk asking for help. You learn that the only thing you must truly fear is the great robber baron of all time: FEAR itself. You learn to step right into and through your fears, because you know that whatever happens you can handle it, and to give in to fear is to give away the right to live life on your terms. You learn to fight for your life and not to squander it living under a cloud of impending doom. You learn that life isn't always fair, you don't always get what you think you deserve, and that sometimes bad things happen to unsuspecting, good people. On these occasions you learn not to personalize things. You learn that God isn't punishing you or failing to answer your prayers. It's just life happening. And you learn to deal with evil in its most primal state - the ego. You learn that negative feelings such as anger, envy, and resentment must be understood and redirected, or they will suffocate the life out of you and poison the universe that surrounds you. You learn to admit when you are wrong and to build bridges instead of walls. You learn to be thankful and to take comfort in many of the simple things we take for granted, things that millions of people upon the earth can only dream about a full refrigerator, clean running water, a soft warm bed, a long hot shower. Slowly, you begin to take responsibility for yourself. by yourself, and you try to make yourself a promise to never betray yourself and to never ever settle for less than your heart's desire. And you hang a wind chime outside your window so you can listen to the wind. And you make it a point to keep smiling, to keep trusting, and to stay open to every wonderful possibility. Finally, with courage in your heart and with God by your side, you take a stand, you take a deep breath, and you begin to design the life you want to live as best as you can

      If you have a tender message,Or a loving word to say,Do not wait till you forget it,But whisper it today;The tender word unspoken,The letter never sent,The long forgotten messages, The wealth of love unspent - For these some hearts are breaking, For these some loved ones wait; So show them that you care for them Before it is too late.

      I thought I'd seen Profound beauty Many times before But when I saw you My heart stopped Your dreamy eyes Revealed dignity And exquisite passion Your smile lit up My deepest emotions When you gazed at me Paradise was revealed For I'd been allowed A glimpse of heaven.

      Saying goodbye Saying goodbye is the hardest thing i have ever done, You touched my life and you touched my heart in ways that i thought were not possible, as we say our goodbyes I fight back my tears, is this for the best? how long will it last? days, months, or years? How could something that hurts so bad be for the good? It seems unreal It is something that i realize is not meant to be understood, I tell myself "it would never work"the feelings would be too deep and someone would get hurt, But there is still that part of me that will not let it burn, will time make it easier? that is something that i will learn, But as of now i think about it every day that has gone by, did we make the right choice? or were we stupid for not giving it a try. I will always wonder why.

      I sometimes find I'm driftingThrough this life without effect;I often wonder if I'm trulyWorth what I've been blessed.I search through days that have been hard,To try to understand,The many trials that I have known,The life that I have had.You see me in my daily grind,So confident and strong;Yet when I am alone, I questionJust where I belong.I often try too hard I find,To analyze and guess,To scrutinize, investigateMy life I will confess.For somewhere deeper, there must be Some meaning to this life,Some way to make a difference,Give a reason for this strife.Is there some hidden meaning?Some agenda to be found?A greater purpose waiting If I care to hang around?It teases and it taunts me,Always slightly out of sight;A hazy vision out of reach,Where darkness hides the light.I struggle to bring clarityTo what awaits me there,And yet this weak illusionAlways fades before my stare.It seems the harder that I try,To focus through the haze,Just serves to add more questions,Through my endless, tired gaze.Perhaps I'm trying just too hard,To understand it all,For can we ever truly knowJust what we have in store?Each incident, each moment passed,Just adds upon the next,But in the end, will I find truth ...Or will I be perplexed?Perhaps I make it harderThan it has to be sometimes,But will my searching bring to meMy meaning over time?Or will it leave me broken,And confused as I feel now,While questions bring no solitude,To this, my wrinkled brow.

      Today has been a good day for me. Working on my cross stitch in between writing. Cross stitch is something i really love to do. Wish i had more time for it. Maybe i will with the kids going back to school next week. Maybe i can find some time to do some of the things i have put off all summer. Anyway today is a good day for me. Actually fill a little normal, lonely but normal. Sitting here looking out my window now looking at my flowers in full bloom. I love to work in my yard and watch my flowers grow. Think that is what i will do this afternoon, work in my yard, sounds good.

       People come into our lives and walk with us a mile, and then because of circumstance they only stay a while. They serve a need within the days that move so quickly by, and then are gone beyond our reach, we often wonder why. God only knows the reason that we meet and share a smile, why people come into our lives and walk with us a mile."

        How can it be this feeling inside, So cold so nothing in disguise, To love to give my all to share, But still alone the heart is bare. Fears are real as days go bye, I have the tiers but cannot cry, A hole exists so deep within, I try so hard to fill it in .Past love hurt it so, so bad,My love is real but heart is sad, Pain once bore from time gone past, Should be healed not have to last. Could it be a wall was built? To stop the pain and freeze the guilt, Life goes on with love that’s strong, But still inside there’s some thing wrong. Maybe if the wall was smashed,The hole would fill to leave no cracks,Then all the pain thats here from the past,Would dissipate this empty heart.But deep inside the reasons why, Are hid away so hard to find, My life in limbo love adrift, I’m left with hardened heart that’s stiff.

      A song, a memoryI am transported in time A year or two younger, A year or two weaker, in shock, in denial, confused, bewildered, nursing a dying ember. hoping, praying, for a spark clutching at impossibility, so hard my hands bleed should have been letting go. What is this feeling? Why this feeling? I have learned my lesson, well.Changed, grown a little less naive, a little more savvy, mostly happy, not quite so alone.The last cord plays,and I am released back into my reality in a mercurial, melancholy mood.

      Please don’t throw empty promises, Into the air, It’s just too much to take. You effect me like no other , I can’t take another break. I know I said I could do this, But to tell you the truth, I don’t know. I think I might be in over my head, As my feelings continue to grow.I know you’re worrying too,And you’re feeling are not quite  the same . And you seem to have it Stuck in your head That good-bye Is what we must say. Don’t you see,That you are wrong? That doesn’t have to be. We can make long-distance work. We don’t have to end this way. But if you’ve got your mind set Please don’t feed me your lines. Don’t try to make me fall for you If you’re not planning to be mine. Something tells meThis won’t end well, And I’m going to regret it. But you will give me Lasting memories, I’m never going to forget . I hate cliché’s of summer love Leading to fall heart break. But in this case I’ll compromise …You’ll be my best mistake.

      To open up and love again to let someone enter your heart,to take that chance ...that risk of again, having your heart torn apart.I look at you and I know Just how very much I love you and wonder without you in my life just what would I do? My heart has no choice but to open and let you come within I look at you and I knowI want to love again...

      To You Alone I Give the Key      I've tried so long and hard, To make some sense of this, Of what you mean to me. But it's beyond all reason,And words just don't mean much, To explain what I feel and see. They all falter beside the feeling, That sends my mind reeling, Of a single kiss or warm embrace. It's so cold without you, Hold me close if you don't mind, I need your warmth, to see your face. Let me gaze into your eyes, Deep into those starry skies, And cradle the tender soul that cries. Come here, my friend, Please accept this love from me... To you alone I give the key.My heart is open wide, Come here, come inside, There's nothing left to hide.

      I may seem a little crazy from time to time. Sometimes i think i've lost my freaking mind just to find out it's all a joke and it's called MY LIFE. Little crazy today i guess not knowing what to do or which way to turn. But one day you will see i'll be were i want to be. Lifes journeys take us far away if only in you minds. Sometimes we have to settle for what we get. You know there are lots of things that people really don't know about me and for them i hope they don't find out. LOL For i am a little crazy from time to time. I know i seem normal on the outside but climb inside this freaking mind and you will see a side of me that will blow your fucking mind..........

      12:05 am just got home from work lot of things on my mind. Can't seem to sleep much these days. Wishing i could change some things in my life but what do i do. Could tranfer to Flordia with the job i have now, but not sure i really want to go that far away from my family. My parents are going down so quick and i don't want to leave them. But god i have to do something i am so unhappy here. At this point in my life i am very confused about what i really want to do. Can move back to memphis and wouldn't be that far from home and could visit anytime. Mom is to close to my girls and i know she is going to kill me. But i have to get away. Heather is grown now and needs to stand on her own. As long as i am here  she will depend on me to much and that will not help her, it will only hurt her in the long run. I may not be around very long and she needs to learn to take care of herself. I wish i could change some of these things i have done lately, i have missed up so bad. Maybe one day things will be ok again. Maybe i can learn from my mistakes.......

      If we might have a second chance. To live the day's once more, And rectify mistakes we've made To even up the score. If we might have a second chance to use the knowledge gained,Perhaps we might become at last As fine as God ordained.But though we can't retrace our steps, However stands the score, Tomorrow brings another chance For us to try once more..........
