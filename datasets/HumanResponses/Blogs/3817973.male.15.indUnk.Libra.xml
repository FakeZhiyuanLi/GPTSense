      Hey everybody, well my newest craze or hobby is playing poker.  I really like to bet, because its the best part.  I'm trying not to get too addicted but i can't help it, feel like marge simpson when she had that gambling problem.  Anyways somewhere in late july i'm going to St.Louis for a nationals team tournament.  The best players from each section form teams and compete against other teams.  Its going to be pretty awesome because there are going to be no parents, just the coaches.  Going to sleep now, later...

      Well today i pretty much did nothing and just watched tv for about 3 hours.  Then at 3 I played in a tournament and I won it.  In the Finals, I played this polish guy who was cursing alot.  The tournament did not have too many high quality players, but its a place to start since I was in a losing streak.  I won the tournament (I lost only 5 games the whole tournament).  Next up: 18 and under sectional tournament in Lancaster which is in 2 weeks. See ya I'm out.

      It was so freaking hot today.  Anyways the whole family went to New Hope just to walk around and look at the shops.  Some of the shops were cool, one shop had a sign that said:                IF A CHILD WALKS INTO THIS STORE UNATTENDED BY AN     ADULT HE/SHE WILL BE MADE INTO A SLAVE OF THIS STORE.    After that we watched this stupid movie.  A sweedish movie.  Honestly, I always wonder why my dad always gets so many damn foreign movies.  Well I have a tennis tournament tomorrow at Princeton.  Wish me luck. later

      Well today was fun.  Not really i am so tired right now.  I had a lesson with my tennis coach who feeds balls like a machine.  I was running nonstop for about 2 hours.  Then after that I hit with one of my friends from south jersey.  Now I have a huge blister on my right hand and two blisters on my feet.  Disgusting..  The good part of today was that I saw a pretty cool movie called Ping Pong.  Its a story of two japanese friends with completely opposite personalities share a bond in ping pong. Anyways, tomorrow is the 4th of July, having a BBQ.  I'm out.

      Whatsup everyone reading this.  This is Jonathan Yu. I'm 15 and i guess i'll be starting to post stuff.  Saw Spiderman 2 opening night at midnight.  The movie was one of the best movies i have ever seen.  It was about 10x better then the first one.  Alfred Molina (Octavius) was a cool bad guy.  Im tired, going to sleep.

      Just got back from St.Louis. The tennis tournament was kick ass. Are section kicks ass. And to any other section out there.... WE OWN YU! Just kidding about that but we really did well. So our section was split into 3 teams. I was on the Leopards which is a very crappy name but whatever. We pretty much played different sections like the Missouri people, New York people, New England people, and the Central guys. So overall I won 2 matches and lost 2 matches so I did ok. Our team came in 5th place out of 17. Not bad. Our other team came in 1st and I send my congrats out to them. The other team came in 7th, which is good.  So anyways I would like to shout out to Grant for being the coolest south african/canadian, Ben for saying very random but funny comments, Vijay who just kicks ass in tennis, Arsenio, Julian, Walker, and everyone else on middle states team.  Also thank the girls for being cool and bitchy to the other sections... i dont know if that was a good comment.  Anyways contact me if you want to hang out or something
