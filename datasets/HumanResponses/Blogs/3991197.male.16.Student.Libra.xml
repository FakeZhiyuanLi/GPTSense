      i just got back from the airport, some parts of my body is missing, a huge chunck just got ripped away. that huge chunk was the seahs, especially russ, charme and darryl. i spent last night and this whole day with charme and russ. we went to rouge where everybody had a blast and partying and chatting the night away i was especially happy because a very special someone was there. but the party i guess was just a diversion from what was going to happen the next day. the party was really great free drinks, good company and lots of photos. but when i woke up this morning i realised, fuck my best friend, his sister who was practically like a sister to me, were going to hong kong for 2 years. i know that they'll be coming down as often as possible but i don't think it'll be the same, hearing russ's freaking laughter that always cracks me up, talking cock with him, chilling around and lolling about, skating, wathing movies and taliking about girls. speaking of girls i'm missing one right now. well russ heard that from me a million times last night and we had a good talk. charme was like an older sis to me she brought me to places that i couldn't get into and introduced me to the world of design. not to forget she introduced me to people like adam, lalat, gen, yip and aarik. i always had lots of fun when i was out with them. today went by really really fast, church lunch and then we were back at the house helping them pack, which i found pretty ironic because we didn't want them to go. jokes... when we got to the airport there were a hell lot of people down there, i think there were more people there than there would be at a likin park concert. seriously. well again everyone was taking photos saying goodbye and we were still smiling. but once we got to the gate i started tearing, it all went by so fast i said my goobyes to russ and charme while crying and they too were crying. i think it was harder for them because they were leaving soo much behind. family and friends. but i tell you the next chance i get i'll be on the plane on my way to hong kong... unless they'll be coming down.  hey russ and charme if you're reading this then take care of yourselves and keep in contact and oh visit us the next chance you get ! i'll miss you guys ! and get the webcam fixed up asap !

      it just dawned on me that i'm fucking depressed. i've been doodling alot and i've been listening to sad music. i usually doodle alot more when i'm depressed because it seems to have a relaxing effect and it takes my mind of things. sigh. you ask why i'm so fucking depressed well first off russell is leaving for hong kong this sunday. fuck. i still remember the time we first started to hang out. graham, boston, russ and i. after school siglap macs and then we'll go to the second floor to slack. haha. then gradually as i got to know russ better, i discovered we stayed damn near each other, so then we started walking home together, on our many walks we would do all sorts of stoopid things... chase injured crows and dangerous road stunts. we both skated at that time,  just starting out and all. so since we stayed near to each other we would usually meet and skate on the lane outside my house. at that point we could only ollie and shit so it was basically ollieing curbs and crap. haha and after every seession we would go to the bubble tea shop for a drink. skating on the lane continued till sec 3. because by then the buddies were slowly forming. as time went by we skated more with each other and yeah we slowly grew closer. hanging out with russ was always fun because he always never fails to crack me up. haha. during sleepovers at his place, not sure why we even go sleepover at each other's house cos we stay so close to each other but nevermind, well anyway everytime i sleepover it'll usually be after a skate session and we'll have our baths and shit then  decide on what to eat cos we're both greedy bastards. haha. the usual would be this chicken thing that his mother buys and instant noodles. simple yet satisfying. haha then we'll chill infront of the telly or go online and bug people. when russ comes to stay at my place it's a totally new agenda because i have a pool. haha. he comes then we'll have dinner and then watch telly and without fail at 12:30 we'll head down to the pool for a nice late night dip. we'll always end up freezing our balls off at about 1:15 after talking and doing flips in the water. we'll dry off and grab our drinks sit on the swing and chat somemore. when we're dry we head upstairs and watch a movie then sleep. haha. russ and i can just fucking sit on the bus not say a word and listen to mp3's and not feel weird at all. that's quite fantastic beacause sometimes we're noisy as hell. then there's also the time when him and i were working at marks and spencers haha. we would sometimes sit on the bus then i'll look at him he look at me and one of us will ask the magic question "wanna chao work ?" hahaha. we were probably the worst employees on the planet. haha. not to worry we eventually quit. haha. fuck i'll fucking miss that son of a bitch when he's in hong kong. haha no more haunted lifts and coconut seeds. well at least he'll be visiting and thank god for msn. i choose not to divulge in the second reason why i'm depressed because it'll probably be another hundred or so more words. love you russ ! but not that way.  good luck in hong kong !

      after spending nearly 17 years on this planet. i've learned alot abut love and relationaships especially during these recant years. well let's see, firstly i'd like to quote charlie brown 'love makes you do strange things' yes love does tend to have that effect. sometimes i'd like to think of love as a drug, because it's addictive and it has side effects. being in love is a wonderful feeling and being submerged in it is even better. and knowing that there's a special person out there who loves you give you a tremendous sense of joy, and knowing that there are people out there who love and care for you whether in a special way or not is also makes life more wonderful. then i want to start of another section with another qoute from charlie brown 'i thought love is supposed to make you happy' yes ladies and gentlemen love does hurt sometimes.no surprised i'm sure. love fucking hurts you sometimes especially when you love that person in a special way. i don't know what is true love yet . i doubt i've experienced it. but i guess you know it's true love when it hits you. but i guess you do even stranger things and you'll just sacrifice everything for that person. but i don't think the person will ask you to do that if she/he really loves you right. relationships are complicated period. in my opinion what makes a sucessful realtionship is love, trust, commitment, communication and honesty. can any two people ever give so much to each other ? i wonder. anyone who's been in a relationship would know that sometimes the partner can do things that may just hurt you soo much. you wonder how something that can make you feel so damn happy make you feel as bad a possible ? thats love for you. then again what would the world be without love ? no valentine's day ? i guess love is something we can't live without. everybody loves and needs to be loved.

      everybody has dreams in one way or another. a dream could be something you dream of at night while you sleep or while you nap in class. that kind of dream is said to be subconscious thoughts,it is said that you dream every night but sometimes you don't even know, sometimes you remember them, sometimes you remember bits of them and sometimes you don't even remember them at all. dreams can sometimes be strange and crazy and yet seem so real. i wonder why it is so. sometimes i dream and when i wake up i still think i'm in the dream because the dream i had was so damn real. don't you wish you could stay i a dream where everything would be under your control? but then don't you think it'll get pretty boring after a while because what makes life fun is the little challenges. or sometimes big challenges. the beauty of dreaming is sometimes dreams can come true. isn't it ? another kind of dream is the kind you are consciously thinking of. your hopes and dreams. well that is also beautiful because they too can come true all it needs is effort. like how i someday dream of being a proffesional photographer and project stoked will be successful. well that's my dream. what's yours ?  dedicated to the girl who's in my dreams who loves to dream. and to all the dreamers out there...

      SERENDIPTY is the apparent apptitude for making fortunante discoveries accidentally.a good example of serendipity is how flemming discovered penecillin. thank god. well serendipity can take many forms like for example you could open a wrong door and then suddenly find the love of your life standing right in front of you. well just watch the movie serendipity for more insights. so what can we say that it's god behind all this ? is it fate or destiny ? but then isn't serendipity supposed to be accidental, so then how can we classify it ? in my opinion serendipity is serendipity. if you ponder on it you'll realise that it's kinda true. well anyway i was struck by serendipity when i came to tp. firstly i found a whole lot of new friends who are really great and i'm really thankful for them. then i also found this really beautiful person she's got the inner and outter beauty. i call this serendipity cos it was sort of serendipity that brought me there. and my buddies were sort of brought together by serendipity. so what is a serendipitous session you ask ? it's a series of fortunate and accidental discoveries. so i ask have you ever been struck by serendipity ? do you dream of a serendipitous session ? and finally would you consider life a serendipitous session ? till next time.

      have you ever really been in love ? this question often pops up in my mind. what is love ? raelly ? can anybody describe the feeling of truly being in love ? in my opinion everybody is loved. by their family, by God, by their friends, by their girlfriends/boyfriends and by those who care about them. well really what is love ? you know to me to be in love with a special someone is when you start thinking about that person like every few seconds, when you would sacrifice time to be with that person, when you can only think about whether that person is ok, when you can only say the nicest things about that person, when you think that special someone is the most beautiful person on earth in and out, when you can't help but dream about that person, when everytime you se that person you get butterflies in your tummy  and that person is the last thing you think about before you drift off to sleep. there are many other things that you do when you're in love. but really love is a beautiful thing and should be cherished. love creates life. thats probably the most beautiful part of love. well to love a friend is a whole new meaning of love. to love someone as a friend is to care about the person and you sort of just look out for them. the joy of friendship. i treasure all my friendships. esp the ones with the buddies and the ppl i hang out with in school. love you guys! and family love is unconditional.  this entry is dedicated to a special someone, the buddies and the people in the end studio.

      can anybody really explain the meaning of true happiness ? is it even possible to feel truly happy ? if it is possible then what is the feeling like ? well i think there are many reasons to feel happy ? whether it is ture and total happiness is another question. stoked is happiness.  happiness is knowing who you are happiness is getting together with your friends happiness is knowing that someone cares happiness is finding someone you like at the door happiness is a dip in the pool on a hot day happiness is a bar of chocolate without nuts happiness is a waterbed happiness is a good back massage happiness is finding out you're not so dumb after all happiness is ice cream happiness is knowing all the answers happiness is landing a new trick happiness is a smooth sidewalk happiness is walking on the grass in your bare feet happiness is a camping trip happiness is chilling with your clique happiness is warm brownies without nuts and vanilla ice cream happiness is not getting caught in the rain happiness is getting caught in the rain with someone you like happiness is having someone to solve your problems happiness is being in love happiness is the hiccups after they've gone away happiness is remote control t.v.'s happiness is expecting someone special happiness is eating out happiness is a good tranistion happiness is kickflips happiness is a cat nap happiness is a new anything happiness is a good party happiness is mellow happiness is over coming your fears happiness is an A happiness is peanut butter with oreo's happiness is winning something happiness is being gald you're you happiness is ahving an audience happiness is your first kiss in the rain happiness is one thing to one person and another thing to another person  happiness is being stoked .

      the meaning of stoked is very simple . stoked is actually a feeling . stoked can be described as a sudden rush of happiness or even an adrenaline rush . stoked can mean to be inspired . for example ' i'm stoked to just to be here' or  'whoa that movie stoked me out'. in context of skateboarding stoked can be use as 'whoa damn landing that ollie down ten stoked me out i'd like to try it again' or 'damn that nollie bs heel he just landed stoked me to skate' in other context stoked can be used as 'i'm stoked to go shopping now, grabyour stuff let's go' see the meaning of stoked is very simple .there is no fixed meaning to the word stoked, and that's the beauty of the word stoked . haha . i'm stoked to be writing about stoked . ok now about project stoked . project stoked is started by two of the buddies - brothers from different mothers - project stoked is basically a company . our company. we're coming up with a video and clothing line and hopefully a magazine on singapore skate culture . watch out for project stoked.
