      the time now is 4.10am.. and i guess i should really be sleeping at this time.. BUT... still gotta go for NDP duty later on.. and most prob gotta stand for a few good hours.. tonight is a night full of thoughts within me.. things hasn't been going on too well recently.. because of the many small incidents.. im starting to see my life in a different way.. in such a way that i myself... cant use word to explain.. coz i myself aren't sure about it.. i've been ponding on how much can ur good frends change with time.. and this thought came real deep into me today.. how much my fren changes over the years.. sumhow.. she's seem abit unfamiliar now.. she's describe that particular incident as for the fun of it.. she's more open minded now.. though it's not a serious issue.. but i juz cant help to think about it.. frend can neglect you.. ignore everything because of a guy they hardly knew of.. know a guy for a month is comparable to knowing a buddy of 5-6 years... this is life.. people changed.. hopefully for the better.. but it seems like people around me changed for the worst to me.. or was im the one who changeD? god knows.. there's so much thing to worry about recently.. it's him.. it's them.. it's sjab.. and it's school work.. after reading Jieyinh blog.. den i've realised my importance in the corp.. i alway see myself as someone who's juz slacking my time there.. nevertheless... i alway give in my best for them... juz when it's the time.. when everyone is enjoying to work with each other.. came the dreadful new.. transferring out to a new corp.. dealing with administration work is not a problem.. but having to take up the full responsibility of a corp.. is a big challenge to me.. though im a officer to be.. i still think it's sumthing which i would not wish to face up with.. there's still so much and so many things i can do in yuying.. there's still so many thing i can learn rom Jieying... but still.. we aren't in the position to decide in major reshufflement like this.. it's either..'u-follow-my-order...or-out you-do..' what is this world coming to?? committing in sjab is solemly a voluntary act... but it seems like.. there's only order to follow.. and we dun have a choice to do wat we want.. we dun get paid for so many tears and time that we put in.. we neither get award or what.. everyone is doing their best... and yet everyone is so hurt from this organisation.. what should be the next step for me? regardless.. of sjab.. them.. him..etc...??

      spAstic me.. i got up in the middle of the night at 4.15am to record this.. it's a involuntary action.. i juz wanted so much to write down my thoughts at the moment.. it's sad... upset.. disppointed..unhappy..!! i've juz lost my phone a few hours ago.. on my way back home from marina promenade.. thanks to the firework festival which seems so interesting.. but isnt so afterall.. stupid me.. i dun even know if i've lost my phone on bus 70 or worst still on the can.. worst thing is.. i dun even know which company is the cab from.. worst worst... not even the car plate number.. worst thing.. only realise my phone is gone when i reach home.. worst worst.. it's a newly bought phone.. which is  less than a month old.. even if some new being found my phone wanting to return to me.. i doubt he can.. first the phone is so low batt that it's shut off.. 2nd..i've this bloody PIN code setting for my sim card.. 3rd who the hell will have a mitsubishi phone charger at home to charge the phone.. so even if that someone is smart enough to replace his/her sim card with mine... he wun have the charger to do so.. unless he have a MItsubishi charger..so maybe for now we can juz imagine.. if i can take the effort to charge my phone fully last night.. and not having the thought that..'well tml is juz going to hQ for meeting and watching firework.. the remaining 1 shld be able to last.. charge tomorrow..'..maybe for now i should have been able to contact that someone who found my way.. maybe and should have. so disappointed with myself.. the number of times that my hp went low batt when im outside is countable with 10 fingers of mine.. and this is the first time i lost my phone.. it seems like.. it's fated that i shall lost my phone on this dreadful day.. isnt it?? 8th Aug 2004 cursEd me.. a day which i'll remember forever.. 2 days after my idol bday.. 1 day after my idol concert(which i went so high yesterday during the concert) .. 1 day before the Nation Birthday.. in which the Nation Birthday means so much to me.. becOz this is the first time.. i'm involve in NDP... even thought it's juz on first aid coverage.. and so i guess im not on the best self to carry out myself as a well-trained first aider tml in front of the 60 000 viewers.. it's a heartbreaking news for me.. for losing a newly bought phone.. perhaps.. because it's new.. or rather because of the content inside.. there's so many valuable messages inside.. but somehow.. it upset me something when i've repeatly read those messages.. and sumtime those messages juz make me smile.. but it's good that.. having lost the phone.. means having to collect a new sim card.. which means.. there'll be no more 'those messages' in my new phone(perhaps).. in which i've promised my dear dear amy that   I'll lead my life in a better way  ... a bEttER Man in a bEttER WAy...
