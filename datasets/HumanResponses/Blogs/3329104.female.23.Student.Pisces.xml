      So it seems like I have been really busy with school and everything but when I start thinking about what am I accomplishing?  Nothing.  It's amazing how that happens.   So remember how I was telling everyone how I live off my GI Bill and disability and go to school full time and live in my parents basement?  I know it sounds really pathetic but its going to get worse soon.  I am going to start working in a video store this summer.  You know Quentin Taratino started working in a video store, of course he was in his teens and I am like 23, but whatever.  I spent four long years in the AF dealing with their bullshit, I need this time to relax and go to school.  Before I left the military I was getting 2.7 average in college.  Now that I am older I will be getting my A.A. with a 3.5.  Yes, Talya kicks ass.  It's just that now I KNOW that I NEVER want to go back into the military unless I have a degree.    Omigod, so I get to teach a lesson plan on Friday.  I am really excited about it.  It will be my first one.  I am going to be doing "Pizza Math" introducing the wonderful world of Fractions to Mrs. Reilly's 4th grade class.  It will be fun.  I will see what I am getting myself into.  Oh yeah this video store hasn't even opened up yet and I got a job there.  I love movies and I need some extra cash since I got accepted into the VA Vocational Rehabilitation Program I will be getting less money a month.  I mean some of my friends thinks it sucks that I will get free school and a monthly stipend but I tell them if I lived in Texas, California, or Illinois as long as you do 4 years of the military ANY state school is free.  So I chose going through the Voc Rehab because that way I can save my GI Bill for my master's degree.  See, me thinking long term and all.  I just hope that I am able to finish my B.A. in 2 more years.  I will talk about that another day.

      So I went to Camp Reed this week with 3 classes of Fourth Graders.  Overall I had a good time.  Some times were better than others.  I guess Camp Reed is like a tradition.  Everyone in Spokane goes when they are in 4th grade and they go to this YMCA camp and spend two days learning about nature and playing games.  I guess it used to be sixth graders that go, but they changed it to fourth graders.  I had a cabin with seven girls.  The girls were great but I just thought it was amazing how many of them got homesick after two days.  I really wish I could have had a boy's cabin because they are much more fun.  The girls didn't want their hair to get wet, touch worms, or even put paint on their face.  I made the mistake about telling the girls about the "Monster in the Lake" and a couple had problems sleeping after that.  The boys were all telling scary stories with no problems.  I don't know, boys are just more fun at that age.    So most of the people who went as counselors were college seniors doing their final student teaching.  They are all graduating this year and pretty soon will be full time elementary teachers!  So two of the counselors were the meanest girls I have met in a long time.  They spent most of their time complaining about the "camping" and making fun of some of the girls in their cabins.  I could understand this kind of behavior from like the high school helpers on the trip but if anything these girls so SOOO much worse.  These girls have had at least three years of working with children so I can't understand if they didn't like kids why were they going to become teachers.  They were the trademark "sorority girls."  Don't get me wrong, I know many normal, friendly people in sororities, but these are the ones that you would see on that MTV show. Ok that's enough writing because I am going to get on the bike for a couple of miles.

      5/12/04 I should probably start off with an introduction.  I am Talya.  I am 23 years old.  I live in my parent's basement in the Inland Northwest and I go to school full-time.  I don't really have much of a life right now.  I am way too overloaded with classes and my student teaching to even grab a beer every now and then.  Hopefully that will change this summer!  I don't work so I am living off my GI Bill.  Yeah I spent four long years in the Air Force.  It really wasn't that bad.  Hindsight is 20/20 right?  I wouldn't have traded it though.  I needed the military to show me that I better get an education or I may be stuck here forever!!!  :-)  I am studying to be an elementary school teacher.  I like kids...I think.  I am actually going to be a chaperone for a 4th grade sleep away camp tomorrow and Friday.  We'll see if I still want to teach after this weekend!    Talya

      I just found out some sucky news.  I was hoping to use the Vocational Rehab for my B.A. and my G.I. Bill for my masters...but it doesn't work out like that.  By the time I finish my B.A. I won't have any months left on my G.I. Bill.  Enough about that.  So I am trying to develop a plan for my weight issue.  I guess I must not be motivated enough because so far this week I have only worked out once.  I need to find the time.  Maybe I should buy the photos with the fat women on it and post it everywhere around my room.  I have time to work out but then I have been using the time to watch the free movies that I get from the video store I work at.  Maybe I should just work out in the morning.  I wish I were a morning person.  I haven't lost any weight.  I still think I need to cut down on my soda intake even if it is diet.  I need to drink more water.  I am going to have a salad today for dinner.  Maybe I can work out before I go to work tonight.  I do need to fit studying in somewhere tonight also.    Hmm...maybe I should be studying now....  good idea...

      So the store opened up.  It is going good so far but I think there are too many people in management.  Two of the women there have power trips.  I am getting annoyed but I think it will get better once everyone is not working at the same time.   My best friend leaves for the Coast Guard in less than two weeks.  I am pretty jealous and wish I were joining something.  I miss the military.  Not all the bullshit I put up with but the camaraderie and stuff like that.  I really don't have that many friends now.  I mean I do...but they are all married and boring.  Okay not boring but would rather spend their time with their husbands than go hiking or taking a road trip.  Oh well, I will get over it soon.  I have 3 weeks left of school for this mini-summer session.  I don't know if I mentioned it.  I really am going to like Eastern.

      So Eastern's pretty cool.  I like the classes I am taking currently.  I may be overextending myself a little too much with the job issue and school but I think once social problems is over I will be doing better.  I think I bombed my first Geology test.  The store opens tomorrow.  I love free movies.  Nothing good is coming out this week.  I don't know I have to check.

      So I started working this week.  SO far I think I am going to like it.  The people are really nice.  It's great to hang out with a whole bunch of movie nerds like myself.  Pamela, actually owns like 356 DVD's.  It's amazing.  We were talking about netflix.  She is canceling her membership.  I should too, but I really like foreign and Strange films and I am sure Movie Gallery is not going to have all the movies I really dig.  So I will keep my membership open in Netflix.  Speaking of movies, I watched Ella Enchanted today.  My mom had free tickets to the movies.  It was really cute.  I really like the Bollywood influence of it.  It had the guy from the Guru and the Indian girl from Bend it Like Beckham.  That's not the influence.  The costume design and the musical numbers is what had the Bollywood influence.  It was so colorful and fun.    I have had the worst headache all today.  I hope it goes away soon.  I was supposed to go out to Kelly's (the country music dance club that is closing down next week) tonight but I just couldn't get the energy to get ready.  Beau, my friend, is leaving on Sunday and I should have just sucked it up and gone with him since I wont see him until next January.  He is going to work in Disneyland, the one in Florida.  I wonder if he's going to dress up as a character?

      So I am supposed to start working this week.  They told me that I was supposed to start on Tuesday but no one has called me yet.  Strange.  That would suck if I really don't have a job.  What the hell am I supposed to do?  I'll stop by the movie gallery tomorrow to find out.

      So today was my last class of Spring Quarter.  Yes I still have class next Monday and Tuesday for final exams but I am pretty much done.  Thank Goodness.  Overall I did great this quarter.  I have only 2 classes left until I finish my A.A.  I am going to be taking Geology 100 at Eastern starting the 21st of June, which I need for my A.A. and B.A. and I am going to be taking my admission of the eduation program at Eastern 200.  That's going to be exciting.  I am also going to be taking Social Problems--well I am taking that now but the class doesn't end until mid-July.  Then in end of July I will be taking Math 212 which is Math for Elementary Teachers II and Intro to Economics.  It's going to be a long summer.  I wish I had more of a life.  I miss it.  My old life I mean.  I used to have such a great time partying and shopping.  I was supposed to get it out of my system by now but it hasn't really worked out as well as I wanted to.  I also got fat.  My self-esteem has some issues that it never had to deal with before.  I am going to go work on that one today at the gym.  I am REALLY going to work on my weight now that its summertime.  We'll see how long that lasts.   I have to study now.

      Dude this math class sucks.&nbsp; Um...you know how professors say that you should leave 2 hours of homework for every hour of class?&nbsp; Usually professors really don't mean it unless you have some kind of learning disability or something.&nbsp; Well this class is really like it.&nbsp; I am so lazy too.&nbsp; It's SOOO nice outside, I don't want to be inside doing math homework.&nbsp; I have 3 weeks left.  &nbsp;

      Well I keep getting Greg's letters and emails from Iraq.&nbsp; I am doing my best sending him something every week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what to send him this week.&nbsp; I probably will have to bake some cookies or something.   He was talking about coming to visit me during his R&R.&nbsp; That should be a lot of fun.&nbsp; I just hope my teachers are cool with me taking some time off to see him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be a lot of fun.&nbsp;

      Wow, I can't believe its already the end of July.&nbsp; The older you get the faster time goes by.&nbsp; Well Sam left last week for boot camp.&nbsp; I am really glad she went and can't wait to hear from her.&nbsp;  Everything is cool at work.&nbsp; I am not letting things frustrate me anymore at the job.&nbsp; It's just a video store, you know?&nbsp; I think I bombed my last geology exam.&nbsp; I am not looking forward to seeing that grade.&nbsp; I got a 4.0 in Social Problems so that is good.&nbsp; Oh I got a scholarship!&nbsp; Yay.&nbsp; It's a Chicano Education Teacher's Scholarship.&nbsp; I wonder if they know I am not Mexican.&nbsp; I am Puerto Rican.&nbsp; It would be like giving someone from Idaho the British Citizen's Scholarship...or something along those lines.&nbsp; We may speak the same language (Spanish) but we are different countries.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; It's 900 dollars.&nbsp; I really need to take a Spanish class so I can refresh my&nbsp; memory. &nbsp; Talya

      I think I am going to invest in a keyfinder. I was watching Along Came Polly and I decided I need one of those. I lose everything. So I went on ebay, found one and it should be in the mail soon.&nbsp; I am so excited that the first part of summer session will be over next week.&nbsp; I am starting to feel a little burnt out.&nbsp; I will get a month off school in August-September.&nbsp;   I am done with the West B.&nbsp; I will find out August 2nd if I passed.&nbsp; Wish me luck. &nbsp;  Next week I start my second methods for teaching elementary math class.&nbsp; I can't wait...I am totally joking there.&nbsp; I am going to have to work my ass off to get higher than a 3.5 in the class.&nbsp; I got a 91 on my Economics test...that sucks.&nbsp; I am going to have to do a lot better than that.&nbsp; AHHH...the pressure.  &nbsp;  Talya
