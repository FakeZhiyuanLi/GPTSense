       Alright.....well I just made this blog and I don't really know what I supposed to put in here, so  why don't i just tell a little bit about me.  OK well I am 15 years old and I am a sophmore.  My favorite things to do include playing softball and basketball and hanging out with my friends.  I love sports!  I played basketball all through elementary and middle school, but i decided not to play in high school because I really needed to focus on my grades...but i still play every chance that i get.  I have two older sisters.  Stephanie Wade and Sarah Gray.  Stephanie is 24 and is married to Mark Wade, they are both teachers at Boyle Co.  Sarah is almost 20 and she goes to UK.  I live with my mom and dad and my dog Cocoa, and Sarah.  I have alot of friends, but my two best friends are Hannah Flora and Jaysa Goodpaster.  We love to hang out and have fun.   I also love to shop and I love the mall!  When I graduate want to go to the University of Kentucky and become a Physcologist.  I will turn 16 on February 14, I can't wait!!!!!  Well thats pretty much all I can think to write, right now......so I will talk to you all later.

       Well so far I think that creative writing class is going really good.  I already feel that in just this short amount of time that I have improved my writing in so many ways.  I also feel as if I am able to express many emotions through writing that I haven't been able to express before.

						   I'm setting up this blog for my second period creative writing students.  I am hoping that they will fiind it interesting to keep personal thoughts, ideas, and writing considerations in this blog.  Likewise, we can post what we write and respond to each other's ideas.  Welcome and good luck blogging! Ms. H

						   OK gang, I've decided to give you some homework this weekend--and lots of it.  After all, that's what you would expect isn't it???  Seriously, I'm sending you on a scavenger hunt.  In order to complete some activities I have planned for a    P O  E  T  R  Y   E  X  T R A  V A G  A  N  Z       A    next week, I need you to have some materials ready.  Your assignment is this:  Each student in the class needs to find each of the following items.  The goal is to find the objects which will be used in class (so you shouldn’t need to have them in the same form to take back home), and not spend any money on them.  Look around the garbage can for the junk mail or a "stash-it-all" drawer for the postcards or letters, for example.  Items due in class on Monday and I will give you credit for all of your hard work.  Good luck and happy hunting!    Item list   One permanent ink marker (preferably some dark color) One t-shirt (white or light color) that fits you An old post-card (blank) An old post-card with message A very, very, very sharpened pencil At least four used postage stamps (at least 1” x 1”--the larger the better)—on the envelopes or off Ten pieces of junk mail An old magazine (school appropriate :) Some sort of blank book A piece of wood (no larger than 1’ x 1’ x 1”) An old calendar page (any month--bring extras if you find them) An old letter A map (can be local, national, world, etc.) A family recipe A shoebox to hold all of it (unless your piece of wood is too big--try to make it fit!)    Point #2 You should begin e-mailing me your drafts that you are beginning to finish.  Mail to:   urlLink lhager@mercer.k12.ky.us

						   Given that your goal is to write at least two entries a week into this blog, I think I'll set things up like this. Each week, I'll give you a prompt (for example, the one from yesterday) and for the other prompt, you will be invited to either post your own writing for people to read/respond to AND/or respond to a second prompt. We'll see how this works. Even though things can be read by anyone searching through the blog, I believe that keeping the response contained will make things run much more smoothly.  Thanks. Ms. H

						   I'm trying to figure out why some of you are on the blog and some aren't.  From what I can see, it looks like those of you who followed the email link are on and those who didn't aren't.  I will try to figure out how to fix this.  Meanwhile, could those of you who DIDN'T follow the link go back and try to follow it.  It might be that the system simply has to make the connection.  Try this and see what it does.  Thanks!

						   Hi all, See, this blogging thing isn't too hard after all! Even I can do it. I hope you've made your way around online and found this journal. My intention is for us to be able to keep it as a class journal much in the way we would do if we were keeping a written, bound journal. The way I understand it (yes, I'm still trying things out here), is that after I put your email in you have to "join." You should have received an email "invitation." Then, you are able to post to this blog.  I'd like to start out by setting up a first prompt for you to respond to: how do you perceive class going so far? I'm interested, particularly, in knowing how you are responding to some of the "freedoms" that writing workshop allows like being able to define your own writing tasks--things that you want/need to write about, etc. How do you feel about being given writing time in class rather than it all being given as homework? What would you like to see as a feature of your class??  The other thing I'd like some feedback on (and I'm going to be asking you in class about this, too) is what you might want our webzine (and print magazine) to look like. What should its title be? We have to start thinking about how we will invite other writers to join our little party, so it's going to be important to make some of these decisions soon.  I can't tell you how long I've waited to teach a creative writing class. I am really enjoying what you've done so far. You just have to promise to push me as hard as I push you (well, maybe not that hard :)  Post your thoughts! I think I'll stumble over to the blog for portfolio_princess and journal my thoughts for the day. . . Let me know if you set up an online blog for yourself (or if you already have one you want to keep working in). I'll have to make note of the URL. Ms. H

						   For this week, I'd like you to consider this question. What is the best piece of writing you have ever done? Describe it. In what particular genre did you write? Why do you consider it your best?
