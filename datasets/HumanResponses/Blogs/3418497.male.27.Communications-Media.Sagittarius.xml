      U know with things not goin my way these days, the only thing i really have to look forward to is doing my work. Even though there are certain reasons at work that are not helping my situation, doing my work is the different story.  Lets just say i had a chance up to the plate and i struck out. I'm kicking myself cause i know i can handle it but i didn't swing the bat fast enough. I know if i get a second chance i won't miss again.

      I saw my ex-fiance a couple of days ago.  It wasn't really by choice but she was at my friends birthday get together (thats what happens when u're best friends is the sister of your ex-fiance and the other is the fiance of your ex-fiance's sister).  Didn't really care much if she was or wasn't there but it did make me feel sad if not more.  Not sad because i miss her or that i want her back but sad because i felt abandoned.  Abandoned by not only my ex-fiance but by my other relationships that i have really cared about, especially from my last one (after my ex-fiance).  I think that last one is having more of a lasting impression on me because i think i haven't completely healed from the damage from the last one (my ex-fiance).

      1. They will always smell good even if its just shampoo  2. The way their heads always find the right spot on our shoulder  3. How cute they look when they sleep  4. The ease in which they fit into our arms  5. the way they kiss you and all of a sudden everything is  right in the world  6. How cute they are when they eat  7. The way they take hours to get dressed but in the end it  makes it all worth while  8. Because they are always warm even when its minus 30 outside  9. The way they look good no matter what they wear  10. The way they fish for compliments even though you both know  that you think she`s the most beautiful thing on this earth  11. How cute they are when they argue  12. The way her hand always finds yours  13. The way they smile  14. The way you feel when you see their name on the call ID  after you just had a big fight  15. The way she says "lets not fight anymore" even though you  know that an hour later....  16. The way they kiss when you do something nice for them  17. The way they kiss you when you say "I love you`  18. Actually ... just the way they kiss you...  19. The way they fall into your arms when they cry  20. Then the way they apologize for crying over something  that silly  21. The way they  hityou and expect it to hurt  22. Then the way they apologize when it does hurt.  (eventhough we don`t admit it)!  23. The way they say "I miss you"  24. The way you miss them  25. The way their tears make you want to change the world so that it doesn`t hurt her anymore.....    Yet regardless if you love them, hate them, wish they would die or know that you would die without them ... it matters not. Because once in your life, whatever they were to the world they become everything to you. When you look them in the eyes, traveling to the depths of their souls and you say a million things without trace of a sound,you know that your own life is inevitable consumed within the rhythmic beatings of her very heart. We love them for a million reasons, No paper would do it justice. It is a thing not of the mind but of the heart. A feeling. Only felt.

      Last nite i went with some friends to the grand opening of a new club called Lucid.  I've been to huge clubs but this club is just HUGE,...three to four floors, at least 7 or more rooms of different music, its just crazy.  Met alot of people from cute to gorgoeous.  Even my friends got a hook up to DJ at Guvernment.  Did i mention no cover, invite only and open bar.  I need more of this,...

      These past two nights has sorta been like food for my soul.  On Wednesday Me, and some friends went to a Nike promotions party somewhere at the Toy Factory Lofts.  I got to meet new people, be in an different atmosphere, have free food with an open bar.  It felt like a Wesley Snipes Blade movie with the outside being all industrial looking.  With a huge old style looking elevator to go up in as the entrance, the whole feeling changes once u step out of the elevator on the top floor.  Interior design of the whole party was pretty hype,  with multimedia projection screens, plasmas, lights, 4 pair turntable dj booth, the works.  They where show casing new Nike product lines, multimedia commercials graphic, design works.  Everything was a new experience, visual and socially.

      I've had more time to think about what i'm goin through.  I consider myself a strong hearted person. But there's only so much that one can take.  After the break up of my engagement, my heart was pretty much devastated, but i managed to survive and managed to start to pick myself up.  The only problem was with this last relationship was that i was still picking myself up.  So with the way and how things went, it didn't just hurt me, it pretty much crushed my heart.  I was on my way back up and then i got hit back down.  I need to get out of here,....

      Being at work is starting to be excruciating.  Its not the work thats killing but the root for me being in this hole is.  I blast the music on my headphones so i can't hear her pages anymore.  How can she want to work things out with her ex, after all the bad things she told me about him.  She doesn't make any sense,....

      Helped my best friend out of a hole.  Got him totally concentrated more on starting his career and now he's so focused into looking for jobs. His outlook in life has completely changed which is an exact opposite of how he was before.  Now i wish i could to the same for me because i feel myself getting deeper in a hole.  And i don't know what to do.  And with each day that passes on,...i feel myself getting weaker.

      Its so hard when you completely fall inlove with someone when their not meant to be yours or when its not given back.  I would rather have not known love then to love at all and get hurt all the time.
