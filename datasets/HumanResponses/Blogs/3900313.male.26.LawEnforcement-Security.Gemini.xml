      So, I just got done reading my first post.  Wow, pretty dark, pretty brutal, and LOTS of errors.  Good thing I'm not picky enough to give a damn about gramatical errors.  I swear I'm not that dark. . . well maybe a little. . . but seriously. . . I'm lots of fun.  I look at life and ask why, a lot.  For instance, why oh why, is it a requirement that you NOT speak english at a drivethrough window?  Why is there never a cop there to pull over someone you see doing soemthing insanely annoying and stupid, but the minute you do something maybe uh. . . less than legal, but performed in a safe manner. . . WHAM!  The FBI, CIA, ATF, SWAT, and a whole mess of other letters jump out of the bushes and give you a ticket?!?  Maybe that just happens to me.  Oh, by the way, pretending like you don't speak english and speaking solely in french doesn't get you out of the ticket.  It get's you a day in court.  Speaking of my day in court.  I personally witnessed 6. . . that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. . . FRIKKEN SIX people, get sentenced to three years probation for shoplifting at Disneyland.  You can steal from who you want, but if you steal from Mickey the Mouse, he puts you on ice.  Here's my thought for the day, the government could track cows from birth to death when the "Mad Cow" scare was going on, yet they can't find the illegal aliens that sneak in daily.  Solution:  Give them a cow.

      Basics. . . you always learn the basics first.  I did, but my basics were different then everyone else's.  A baby learns to cry, it's the first thing a baby learns.  It has no way to communicate so for survival it makes loud, un-ignorable sounds.  Someone will here. . . someone will feed/change/peek-a-boo/whatever the hell it is you do with babies.  I don't really know.  Baby's scare me.  I'm 6'4' 287 lbs of brute force. . . and they are fragile.  Enough said.  I wasn't always the brute.  I used to be fragile.  In some ways I guess I always will be.  To start my story, I came screaming into this world on the 26th of May, nineteen-dickety-two.  I was the sole survivor of what they were sure were twins.  I was 10lbs. .. that's right 10lbs at birth.  A second old and already larger than most babies.  They doctors didn't know why then.  Just figured I was a healthy baby, and that my mother carried extra fluid which caused a heartbeat echo creating the illusion of twins.  Later, however this was found to be untrue.  The twins became one.  It's a rare occurrence.  Usually it causes conjoined twins, but in rare cases the twins simply cease existing as two beings and become one.  Sometimes it causes deformations. . . extra teeth. . . teeth growing in the spine. . . carnival sideshow material.  This wasn't my case however.  Just a few slight, and mostly invisible differences. . . more muscle. . . stuff like that.  It just makes me a bit more durable than most.  I guess it was just some benevolent supreme being preparing me for the life in store for me.  The Runt and The disappointed Drunk  So, we all know I was born a pretty big  baby, but fate deemed I learn to crawl just like everyone else, and deemed I learn to be meek, as I became one of the smallest kids in my area.  My father, I guess, started to resent the children, (myself, and my older sister.)  For what reasons, I'll probably never know.  I mean, maybe it was because being a parent meant sacrifices, maybe it was because now he had to share attention with us, or maybe we were just disappointments.  I tend to lean towards the last one.  My father wanted a son.  This he made very clear.  (Ironically he already had two sons that he had nothing to do with from a previous marriage.  Go figure.)  When my sister was born, he exclaimed, "He's not done yet, put him back in."  When I was born, he was thrilled, even though every SINGLE member of my family argued over what my name would be.  My Grandfather being French and Native American insisted my name be French and Native American.  My mother insisted my name be Christopher Warren, so that I would share my grandfather's middle name.  My father's drinking buddy at the time was Scott, and all of the men in his family had the middle name Joseph. . . damned Catholics!  What was my name at birth?  Didier Christoph L'uso Levesque.  Say that three times fast.  Is that my name, now?  Hell no!  It's now and forever, Scott Christopher Levesque.  So my father had his son of lore, all was good, right?  To be honest, I don't remember a lot of my childhood.  I think I might be repessing some of it, the rest is due to an injury.  Safety Tip of the Day:  Boys and girls, always wear a decent motorcycle helmet!   Anywho, what I do remember is my father drinking.  It was an odd tightrope, because if he had nothing to drink he was miserable and mean, if he had too much to drink he was miserable, mean, cruel, and violent.  If he was slightly buzzed, he was kind and generous and silly.  I learned quickly when to hit my dad up for something.  The problem was, though. . . sometimes he'd agree to something, sober up, and forget all about it.  Empty promises were my life.  As were beatings.  I'm not talking a cuff on the ass, either.  I'm talking, "I fell down the stairs, again," beatings.  I learned to avoid my father and either escape into the forest behind my house, or into my room.  So meek I was. . .  School Daze  So now I get introduced to a whole new world, school.  The best and worst years of my life.  My small stature and sheer meekness made me an excellent target for bullies, and since I was already used to getting beaten, I didn't know anything was wrong with this.  I did however have my quick wit and smart mouth as my defense.  Bullies and I had a strange relationship.  Half the time I had them in stitches and laughing, the other half the time I had them wanting to wallop on me.  I got good at making them laugh, though.  I guess that sharpened my wit and charm, which is always useful.  The relationship between myself and my father grew more distant.  I began to spend more time with my uncle and my grandfather.  This is where I learned of two things, my heritage, and prejudice.  I was too white in the winter to be accepted as a Native American, and too dark in the summer to be accepted as white.  My uncle had become a surrogate father to me.  I learned a lot from him.  He taught me about life on the farm, about cattle, about wild life, how to track, stuff like that.  During my junior high years, two things happened that changed my life forever.  The first being, I finally grew.  I was now pushing 6ft tall.  However, I was not aware of this.  Working on the ranch made me strong, again, I was unaware.  In my mind I was still small, and still a victim to bullies.  The second, and horrible thing was, my uncle passed on.  Cancer took him from me.  I wasn't there when he died.  I should have been.  For some reason, I couldn't bring myself to sit by him for more than one day.  I just didn't want to see him that way.  I was convinced he would be there tomorrow.  Then, one night, he passed.  I was there for his funeral, this would be one of the few times I can actually recall crying.  My uncle was an avid smoker and he had a brass lighter which he used to amaze me with.  He had tons of tricks he could with it. . . neat ways to light it, and put it out.  He could, using slight of hand, make it disappear.  When he died, he left this lighter to me.  I carried it with me, everyday.  At this time, a particular bully entered my life.  His name was, Sam.  The funny thing is, he wasn't a big guy.  He was maybe 5'5". . . 5'6".  For some reason, however he tormented me endlessly, and I allowed him.  He traveled with a pack of hyenas that would laugh as he beat on me, or did such fun things like pick his nose and wipe it on me, or spit gum in my hair.  Of course I hadn't lost my smart mouth, and unleashed it upon him.  His hyenas would laugh, he would get angry.  I could never make him laugh.  I didn't have the usual bully/relationship with him.  Finally one day I had something exceptionally smart-assed to him, and was challenged to a fight.  I knew better than to not show, plus I was used to taking a beating.  So there I was, before gym class, in the locker room, awaiting my beating.  Wham!  My nose is bloody.  Crack!  My lips spits.  Pow!  My eye is black.  I fell a few times, and the last time, my lighter came out of my pocket.  Sam took it and taunted me with it.  I pleaded for it back insisting that it was all I had of my uncle's.  Sam finally saw something that he always wanted to see but never did.  I cried.  My father had already taught me not to cry when he beat me.  Now I cried.  So Sam taunted me farther.  I finally went after the lighter.  I lunged for it, and he yanked it back and hit me hard.  Something in me snapped.  The only thing I remember doing was screaming. . . and flying at him.  Slamming his head into a locker again, and again.  To this day, Sam still has headaches.  Some say it was justified, but I still have nightmares about it.  This opened a new chapter in my life.   Enter the Shrinks.  Now I had to see a shrink every Tuesday and Thursday.  In the middle of math class, I would gather my things and go see the school shrink.  Of course this was supposed to be anonymous, but it was a small town, and everyone knew where I was going at that time and why.  This formless rage I had inside me, began to take form, an edge inside me.  It also began to change who I am.  I was no longer the class clown, but more of a sardonic and dark jester.  I began to see less and less jokes in life, and rather to see life AS a joke.  My smile was gone.  To this day, I rarely smile.  My neutral expression remains a scowl.  I learned to master my size and use my rage as a tool.  Intimidation was the name of my new found game.  My shrink told me I need direction.  This was their way of putting me on the football team.  Was it for my help and benefit or the benefit of the football team?  I'll never know.  I played, and played well.  Well enough to get a scholarship.  During my junior high and highshool days, my neighbor attempted to teach me control and focus.  He was a sensei.  He taught me bushido and choy li fut.  He taught me out of his house rather than his class.  There were two reasons.  One was that he felt I needed more attention, and two, his grandson needed a friend.  His grandson was home taught due to disorders he had.  He had lost an eye at an early age due to a tumor, and his stature was small, and frail.  His courage was great, though.  We balanced each other well.  He was small in stature and great in spirit, however I was great in stature and empty in spirit.  He too was taken too early from this world.  This happened a few years ago.  Long after we both went out separate ways.  I went on to Arkansas to play football, which pretty much set up the darkest chapter of my life.  The Great religion of Football. . . and a Job Offer.  While I played football I continued my aggressive tendencies.  I insisted on being a bigger and better player.  This introduced me to steroids.  This also introduced me to a new crowd.  The seedy underworld that we all ignore exists.  I got a side job as well.  Simply delivering packages. . . just a currier, but this job allowed me two things; steroids and other recreational drugs, and money.  Then my football career ended.  A 6'7" Samoan fell on me and bent my knee the wrong way.  So I bummed it out with a friend while I underwent some painful surgeries.  Of course as usual course of things I burned my bridges there.  Found myself faced with either going back to Maine, or finding a job.  This is when I was offered a job.  I was still a big guy, and still pretty menacing.  So now I collected "debts."  I made more contacts and became well know as a "taxman."  No, I didn't work for the IRS.  This lifestyle had gotten me some great memories. . . scars. . . I've been stabbed, shot, worked over with a bat, hung. . . you get the idea.  I've also been to several different countries.  It caught up with me, though.  The drugs and beatings had both my body sick and weak, but the tattered remains of my soul took the hardest hit.  I began to hate my reflection.  My eyes, forever dark. . . always rings under my eyes.  So, I found myself home.  My mother and the old man had split, so I moved in with the old man.  With no one to take care of him and old age creeping up, he needed me as much as I needed him.  I got a regular Joe-job.  I also worked second shift so it kept me out of the sunlight I had learned to loathe.  I got myself healthy, and ever met a girl.  Enter Satana!  Her name was Sheri, and she saw past the dark exterior, and showed me my smile again.  We had a great year together.  She was originally from California and decided she wanted to go back, so to California we went.  Shortly after I got here, she hooked up with her old friends, started to play with drugs and lost her job, so I slaved away to support her and her family while she played online.  She met her "master" online, and in the long run of things began to treat me like shit, cut me off from sex, and eventually went to be with her married "master" and his wife.  Pretty sad if you ask me.  Me, I feel apart.  Weary again, I decided it was time to sleep, forever.  I attempted suicide.  I realize it was stupid but my waking and sleeping hours were filled with nightmares.  When you sleep less and less, crazy ideas seem less crazy.  Some great friends, and people that cared for me, pulled together, and saved my life.  I almost married one of them.  Her name was Page, and we shared some magic moments, unfortunately the magic wore out for her, so she left my life, to this date I haven't heard from her, which is probably best, because part of me will always love her.  It was hard for me to learn to love, aparently it's harder to learn how to stop loving.  So here I am. . . rebuilding.  Single for the past two years, still digging myself out of the debt my ex left me in.  More and more, I find myself smiling.  I've learned to enjoy the sun.  I've also kept myself legit.  The rage and negativity, while it will always be a part of me, is now just a small player in the cast of my life.  So, should you be reading this, and be single and have like. . . uh. . . boobs, and uh. . . are a nymphomaniac.  Hit me up.  HA!  See?  I still laugh.
