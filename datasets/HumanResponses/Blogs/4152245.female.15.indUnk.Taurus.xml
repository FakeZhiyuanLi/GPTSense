           hey well ne wayz boys can be very stupid at times, for example one of my ex boyfriends. well it all started wen i was just talking to my friend ysatis on my house fone and it was like 1:30 in the morning, and then all of a sudden sum one calls me on my cell but the number was restricted, so i answered and it was my stupid ex- “Ralph” who was prank callin.. of course we knew it was him.. he made it sooo obvious!! O0h man!! First.. he was pretending to be Arnold Schortzineger, then Micheal Jackson, then some fortune teller telling us we were gonna be preganat in 3 months! (lol) it pissed me off buhh it was funny! but it sounded like it was a recorder....lol..... it was a "YOU HAD TO BE THERE!" moment. then i just decided to hang up cuz it was starting to get annoying. so i just kept on talking to ysatis about the usual junk we talk about. but after a while the same restricted number called my cell again and i answered and i started to curse them out and i put ysatis on speaker so she can talk to them to...lol... shes so STUPID! you had to hear her. then at the very end wen i was like about to click on them the person that was prank calling finally spoke up and said his name and of course.."what a surprise" it turned out to be my ex ralph!!! i wanted to kick his ass so badly so i calleed him back and he didnt pick up so i left him a message that i was gonna call the cops on him for harassment (lmao) i scared the crap out of him!! until he finally called me back.. sayin sorry, begging not to call the cops (lmao) and i was bitching him out and stuff and this was going on for like 2 hours. and all of a sudden he brings up the subject saying that he just wants to be more than just friends omg that pissed me off so much and than he was like trying to convince me to go out with him again but it sounded more like he wanted to rape me...lol...so ne wayz i just told him str8 out that i didnt even think of getting back with him, and that i never think of him not even as a friend...so and he was like really pissing me off, so i double lined ysatis so that she can talk too.. lol .. it was like a Jerry Springer show...lmao... then we were talking normal.. and he was like “yeah u should see how I look now!? (hes so conceded!) I took steroids and got so ripped! u should see me now!” then ysatis (lol) was like “o0h man! Steroids!? You must look worse than b-4.. that shizz makes u lo0k like a horse! and omg.. that’s illegal!” (lol) shes such a dork (lmao)... then he started tryin cover up &amp; talking about Elise how she does illegal stuff too .. like weed..(by the way she only TRIED it once!) so he was trying to look good saying he talks to Elise and all these other people…so whatever.. LOL... and omg there was this old lady that inerfered with our conversation and it was the same old lady from a long time ago that used to always interfere with my conversations with ysatis and jorge....i missed her!!!! lol... to bad jorgito wasnt there!!!well ne ways i g2g.
