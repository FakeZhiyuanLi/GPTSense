      Good morning World from Louisiana. I listened to Barbara Simpson, as she was taking Georges place on account of he is on vacation, for all of 15 minuets last night. She had a numerologist expert on. (gag)  +Prediction progressing +H.D. Smith Wholesale Drug Co., the seventh largest pharmaceutical wholesaler in the U.S., has launched an RFID pilot with the goal of improving efficiency and product safety in its supply chain. They play read only smart tags on their test units by hand and track them to market. This is the first step to having the FDA mandate it. Will add later today

      This very encouraging, it would appear that after being online for less than a week, some one I don’t know has read my blog. Well Kris, I had heard of this satellite, but I did not know about the seas on titan. It seems abit far for methane seas to be of any use over there, but one day…. Who knows? Maybe they will put moon corp. out business :- .  Hmmm…. Perhaps I should place a post explaining moon corp?  A psychologist by the name of Leo Sprinkle (funny last name, no idea where it’s from) has made several interesting discoveries on phobias. This is not important, but I think it is interesting. One man, who was afraid of dogs, was hypnotized (hoody hoo!) for the purpose of pinpointing the cause of the phobia. Nothing was found when asked about early memories. However, when asked about his first memory concerning his fear of dogs, the man remembered a scene with a man from the middle ages who was eaten by a wolf. The man assumed it was a past life and thanked Sprinkle. (hehe…) Another woman had a fear of drowning, and had similar results; she recalled a scene where an annoying pirate was thrown over board by his mates. She reached a similar conclusion as well. Both patients had a sense of identity with the character being killed. Sprinkle is in agreement with his patients, and believes that some phobias are caused by past deaths.   I bring up the thought of dreams. A dream is stored in the subconscious forever. They be misinterpreted by even deeper levels of the subconscious, or the conscious, and reapplied to the sub….. That’s my two sense on that. I’m looking for his e-mail so I can make the suggestion and have him question my credentials but have failed so far.

      It's late, I'm tired, this post will probably be very short. I have spent the weekend at my dads and at my grandpas. I also directed a bit for John (at fencing) Saturday. Total, I made 45$ this weekend for only 15 hours of work. Hoody hoo! As you can not see my face I will tell you of my sarcasm. I love all this charity work. I also played D+D Saturday for a few hours. Donny convinced us to play J3 instead of J4a. I like Scott’s cataloging system :-). I feel extraordinarily disappointed in my self as the only pertinent information I got this week end was the early change of power in Iraq. *sigh* oh well. George just came on, maybe something good will be on. Sorry to all you inexistent readers who will be disappointed to find that I have failed to post anything of value today.   No word of the day. Quote of the day: Shakespeare, Pompey on the mort de Pompey “All is legitimate in the service of Ceasur.”

      I didn't post again yesterday, but did listen to George Noory for 2 hours. This will be my first "real" post, with sections, "important stuff" and other things that qualify it as real. Things that I have found in the last 24 hours that are importantish + A device was recently patented that allows radio transmission using the human body as both a power source and an antenna. Cell phone companies are currently fighting for it. it is apparently Japanese in origin, but patented here anyway. I don't know, there is a gap there from what George said and what I've found so far on independent research. It is called the finger phone, and fits on your wrist. Its inventors name is Masaaki Fukumoto. I am not yet done researching this topic, and I do not yet have grounds for my suspicions, but expect a follow up on this story.  +Prediction completed- "LegoLand", in Windsor in the UK, has started a program of renting RFID wrist bands that can track kids any where in the park. It is important to note that this is not GPS strength stuff, but merely a network of passive readers placed in the park. Now, why doesn’t that make me feel better?  +Prediction complete- alright, truth be told I knew about this for several weeks from the drudge, but, I did not have this blog then, and it was on George yesterday, so I'll take my self served credit now. This month, after, in January of this year, scientists in the US made rats super strong by limiting their myostatin, a protein that limits muscle production, a "natural" mutation has been discovered in Germany tat allows a two year old to lift 3 times his body weight. Apparently there was also some research on this 7 years ago. What scares me is that this toddler’s mutation only "fully developed" late last month.  +Update on progress of RFID- there has been a universal production increase. Actually, truth is told, this news is a little late as well, however, I did only find out about it today. A supreme demand in nearly all types of RFID tech has caused many producers to go into the red in order to invest in more machines. This includes shadow soft, truth software and other very prominent production companies.  +NASA has announced a program to aid the private sector of space travel. This is either a very good thing, or maybe limited by controlling factors NASA may place on the companies that are their beneficiaries. The specifics have not yet been found, so expect a follow up.  Word of the day - maundering- to wander aimlessly, to speak with out purpose.  Quote of the day-the Columbus (Ohio) citizen (newspaper) "A study by three physicians shows that maybe as many as two out of three births in the US result from pregnancies."  Might add again later. Going to do more research now, then eat, maybe play a little gun bound, I think I have my double metal axe now.  +New prediction- Iraqi prisoners will begin to spout out tons of information as we release our newest toy on them. Perhaps new is the wrong word, as the pentagon released partially classified versions of the thing several months ago. As this is not a current thing, I will not go far into, but as I have not said anything about it as of yet and there maybe person interested in it, place in to google "active denial system" and see what comes up. time frame. Unsure, this the area I usually get wrong. My guess is this most likely to happen closer to election time. confidence=2. I only have this suspicion because of the multiple .gov sites I have found stressing it would not be used in torture.

      Hello again all. I am back from Canada and shall do my personal ranting after my reporting.  &nbsp;  *RFID UPDATE* A company in the UK has begun research for the stated purpose of selling a system of meat tracking chips to the US. The chips run at a higher frequency than regulation chips in the US. Their plans look suspiciously like the plans of our good friend, the New York Senator who wanted to implement such a plan back in December and failed.  &nbsp;  *Animal behavior update* earlier this month, July the fifth, over 200 melon head whales crowded into a harbor in Hawaii for two days. Two weeks earlier, 96 confirmed witness saw a cigar shaped object disappear over a set of mountains.  Another “manged fox” was seen in Baltimore, but the experts, though not retracting any statements have not yet deemed what it is. I have looked, but have not found a credible UFO sighting in the last 3 months near there.

      I will not post again untill at least late monday as I am going to NC for the fencing nationals in 45 minuets. Sorry for the misspelling, I don't have time to proofread today, and stuff is going on that I have to post on.  RFID Update* They have finally figured it out. They have found the leverage they need to make RFID a welcomed tech, by the entirty of the world. Convieniance. European retailer, Metro, has designed and plans to implement a system in which you, the costumer, would shop by feeding a computor a list, it mapping out the best course for you to take, you shopping, and then just waltzing out with out paying as the stuff you bought sends a signal to a reciever that automaticly charges it all to your credit card. Dam. I will not give up gracefully though. The games not over till they tag me.  Animal update* A man in Chille ,Juan Acuqa, dragged himself into a hospital after being alledgedly attacked by two winged creatures with dog faces. His wounds do not appear to be made by knives, scratchs or blows. The description he gives us of them make them sound nothing more than a Catholic daemon, even down to the point of not touching water. I have my suspitions that it is a hoax or cover up, but it is worth noting that a UFO was sited in Chilli not a week ago. for your own viewing, please go  urlLink here

      Yello again and good morning. I have fencing today, will help my grand pa tomorrow and will leave for nationals Thursday. When that happens, I will not post for a while.  John Kerry picked a running mate and announced it on the internet first.  It’s John Edwards in case some one doesn’t know and /or cares.  First pictures from Titan have returned and are giving scientist a knock on the head. They are opposite of everything they expected. I don’t really care, but I know kris did, so here’s a link.  urlLink here   More unusual animal behavior. Cephalopods around the world a migrating towards fresh water. I don’t know why I didn’t see this one, it’s been there for a while, I am speaking of the panther attacks in Mexico.  Another mysterious scientist death. I thought this was just some weird conspiracy theory, but it seems to be perpetuating its self. A microbiologist in Houston was run down by an unmarked SUV on the sidewalk Sunday. If you haven’t heard of it, it seems that many scientists world wide that have an expertise in microbiology and/or diseases seem to be dieing of some what suspicious causes in the last two or three weeks. A 40 year old in Africs had a heart attack, a 46 year old had a stroke in London, Ect.    *Prediction* I have made the realization that everywhere there has been a ufo siting recently, there is also an animal acting strangly. Louisiana, the pelicans migration paterns are diffrent, Mexico, the Panthers... duh! and the squid near europe and several other areas in the US and Africa. I don't know whats happening, or what it concernes, but I think somethings up, wheather or not we find out about it later. This makes this prediction difficult to check, but I give it an 8.

      Good morning from here. I hope all of you are haveing a better day than I am, but I can't complain too much, for I fell reletivly encouraged. Not much news today, just some German Scientists  publishing some research that seems to fit in with my previous theories on esp. Also, it may be worth noting that there were more UFO sightings in the last week than in this year so far, and several groups of animals are behaving strangely, including some pelicans just off the coast where one of the siting were.  NEWS FLASH!!!!  RFID NEWS!  German Scientist Dr Stefan Schmidt have found evidence they believe suggests we have a sixth . Dr Stefan Schmidt and his team carried out two experiments a thousand times, which is really a small number in comparison to similar studies, and believe they have finally proved the reality of the preternatural perception in humans. The first, called "remote staring", consisted of a volunteer in a sealed room watching a second volunteer in another room via CCTV. The second volunteer was hooked up to electrodes which recorded the "prickle" or electrical activity of the skin. This was compared when the volunteer was or was not being watched. In the second experiment, called "direct mental interaction", the first volunteer concentrated on making the second feel uncomfortable or relaxed from within the sealed cell. The German team used a complex statistical scale to grade the studies according to reliability and paranormal effect recorded. It is worth noting that complexity is often a disguise for inaccuracy.  In other experiments, the starer tried to make the other feel either uncomfortable or relaxed. Again, the electronic monitor proved repeatedly that it could be done. In the British Journal of Psychology, Dr Schmidt noted that the data was ambiguous but found that "for both data sets there is a small but significant effect". In similar experiments, when assuming we catch 10% of those who cheat and are predisposed to slanted judgement, 2% of experiment seem to have genuine preternatural senses and or abilities, being that they are above chance.  While the findings will please believers in the paranormal, they are not enough to convince the skeptics.  Like it ever is. 2% is simply not enough for a case. It is worth noting though that that 2% is constant through out all time periods, and different types of research. :-) As the articles I have found on this topic do not specify, I can not tell you if these experiments involved multiple subjects or if they met the decline effect.  I apologise for the detailed description, but experiments require a good explanation.   *RFID update* a bill in California that would have forced companies to label products with RFID chips in them was defeated yesterday.

      Hello again all who might read this.  I have been at my dad’s house for the last couple days for special reasons that I will not go into. However, the important thing is that his internet connection was down and I could not post or look stuff up, so sry for the poor post. I got three discs of full metal panic a sun coast, and even got Mark to buy one. He is now hooked. Heheh….  Kris, I have heard of that theory, and find it more likely than reincarnation. My personal favorite theory though is the seventh conscious theory. It’s not very popular, but I like it. It says that humans have at least 7 layers of consciousness, the first being the one we operate in every day, the second being our subconscious, and so on and so on. Each layer has certain properties to it, and each one is interconnected the ones surrounding it. They were once all spelled out to me, but I’m afraid I lost the paper and have not found another one. Any way, they can supposedly be reached through meditation and or hypnosis. I have personally experienced the third and fourth layers, through self hypnosis, a lot fun actually. Any way, the theory is that the seventh layer of consciousness is a universal one, shared by all of us. Others say that is God, a universal consciousness, not limited to humans, but also shared by spaces and objects. This includes past, present and future possible multiversional turns. There have been three occurrences that I have found that seemed like they involved people able to reach this layer, the most recent being in 1950. This could not have been the case for Sprinkle, as he was only in the second layer, which is the most useful one as it is directly connected to the layer we spent most of our time in. All of them involve a hypnotist and patient, not one of them was a self induced state. Boo hoo.   In other news, China has taken to censuring text messages on phones, and has already punished three companies for resisting. Make us look more like Free State, which is a good thing.
