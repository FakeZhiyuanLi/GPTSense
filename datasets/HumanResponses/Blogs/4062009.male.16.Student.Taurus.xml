      It's time to show off one of my older poems bet before I do, I would like to address an comment posted about my new poem.   urlLink  Meishi    said... I hope you don't mind a little criticism.. Um, it feels like, to me, you were trying for a rhyme scheme but I don't feel it, also your meter is a bit inconsistant. I mean don't get me wrong the ideas within the poem are great and the poem is good, but it feels like its struggling to be good.  A struggling mind writes a struggling poem. I write what I think and whatever comes at me first. At first, yes I was trying to write a peom that ryhmes for I like poems that ryhme. Yet is it not true that a poem can be whatever it wants to be. That is what many people say so after words, after I reviewed it myself, I decided to leave it how it is. Anyway, think of it this way, I have just thought about this myself. This world is about mankind basically, and it talks about how mankind has grown from a civilized world, as we like to think we are, to a world run by greed and hate. The world has broken up, and now you look at the poem structure and like you have said it has broken up. A broken poem for a broken world, a struggling mind writes a struggling poem, an angry man writes a poem of sadness (Which is mostly the case, right?). Do you understand? Thanks for your comment! :D  Well, now it is time for one of my older poems. Here it is,  I Lay Here ...      I Lay Here

      This is the weekly round up. I will do this ever Friday when I can just going through everything that has happened to me over the week. Now do take note that school has not started yet but it shall soon, so my Round Ups will not really be exciting because of it. But once school starts, then the fun begins because you shall see me complain a lot! LOL!  Well what happened this week. Nothing much I have to say that it was just a normal boring week. Dad went to court Wednesday, his divorce hearing.&nbsp;Mom and dad went to the mall on a few counts to look for some shoes that&nbsp;"mom" (My dad has hooked up with someone he knew a long time ago. The wife he is divorcing never showed affection to him so I can understand why&nbsp;so soon.)&nbsp;can wear. Can you believe that these pair of tennies that she got is her first pair ever! I am truely shocked by that, I must say.  Anyway, they went shopping and they got what they want. Me, I did pretty much nothing by just staying home and watching movies; working on the computer and things like that. And because of all that time on the computer I have managed to get my pulse on WhatPulse up to 58,000+ keystrokes. Woot for me! :D  Also over this great week I have gotten two comments on my articles. Yeah! My first ever two comments. And I shall address those comments here and right now. LOL!  "   urlLink Corwin Silvermage  said...  Wolfwood, as in Nicholas Wolfwood from Trigun, Eh? Good anime." Thats right Corwin, I got my name from the anime. I love Trigun, in fact I bought that $200 DVD collection of it because I like it so much. I know, I'm crazy! LOL!  " urlLink firequall  said...  logical thinking and it makes sense. good deducting!" Why think you firequall. I am glad you agree with&nbsp;what I believe in when it comes to life and sex.   Isn't that cool or what! LOL!  Last but not least of my week I have posted two poems that some of you poetry lovers might like. Just scrool down the page to "in this world i live" and "work of art" to read them. Enjoy!  That concludes the weekly round up ladies and gents. Talk to you all later! Cya!     Wolfwood

      I just got off a nice good game of Renegade. But I must say that it is not my best day of playing, in fact I think it may be with the worst. LOL! Why?   Well mainly because every 5 to 10 mins in the game I got shot in the head by a sniper. I must say that after a while it becomes a real pain. You know what I mean.   Anyway, now I am bored! I don't know what to do and my dad will be home soon. (Joy... lol) Maybe I shall just surf the web or see what other Blog sites are up too. I don't know... Maybe I just might start reading...   ...   ... Nah... Well I guess I will go now. There is not much for me to tell you anyway. I don't even know why I am posting this. I guess I just feel like it. LOL! Later!      Wolfwood

      I recently today came across this great site which, from the looks, is run by the Grandmother of this family. And her daughter just recently had a child, a baby boy. Isn't that great or what. This site is called  urlLink  Chit Chat   and they have some pictures for you all to see there so do go check them out, the little one is so cute.   ---   Boy o' boy this is going to be one hell of a week. Even though this week is ending, I still have a busy time ahead of me. School starts in about one week and I still haven't started my summer reading. I need to really tonight but I don't feel like doing it right now.   I hate school, I must say. I really hate my high school too for it is just ugly as hell. Do you know how long my high school,&nbsp;It's called  urlLink  Milton   by the way,&nbsp;has been up? Ever since the 80's!! And ever scince then, the school has become infested with rats and rouches. Anyway, they are building a new high school soon yet it won't be done until my senior year in 2005-2006. Isn't that just great or what?   I wish I could go to this other high school,  urlLink Alpharetta High School . The school is brand new and this year will be its first year of classes. And I must say right now that I have never seen such a great looking high school before. Sadly though, I am districted to go to Milton. AHH!   No matter though, school is just school, right? I do hope I get the classes I want. I signed up for Web Design, Sculpture 2, and Graphic Design. And it all starts August 9th, much later then my past years of high school.   Well one thing is for certian, at least I get to go to Universal, Orlando before going to school! WOO HOO! Thats my favorite place to go to on vacation and I plan on having a great time while I am there.   Anyway, I got to run. Later everyone!      Wolfwood

      Well my poems aren't a work of art, that I know. I just feel like calling my threads that. Anyway, everyone once and a while I will show you one of my older poems. Right now know, I am not writing any but I will start up again soon, I'm sure of that.   Without further delay, here is my first poem  Day & Night .       Day &amp; Night      &nbsp;  Day and Night  Night and Day  Why wonâ€™t these feelings  Just go away.  It makes me wonder  Why my life is gray.  And still my life  Goes on stray.  &nbsp;  These feelings I have  Just want to stay.  These feelings I have  Make me lose my way.  I try my hardest  To find my way.  Yet I end up  Moving farther away.  &nbsp;  Night reaches out  to cut it out.  Day reaches out  to start it again.  It looks as though  My life is not so gold  And even now  I am growing old  &nbsp;  Day and Night  Night and Day  Even to the end  I still lose my way.      &nbsp;  Well there you go guys and gals. I hope you all like it. I wrote this poem for school for my Language Arts class and when I let my friends see it, they said it was outstanding. I hope that is true for you all here. Anyway, there it is.

      Many of you never think about this and how sex effects your life and many of you don't care. But sit down, relax, and I will tell you something that may make you think otherwise. I was born in 1988, my parents where way to young when they had me; my dad was 18 and my mother was 17. Now because of that, it shows that they had sex before they got married. Alright, no biggy right? Wrong.   My dad has been married 4 times already. All of them have ended badly costing him thousands and lots of time of his life. You know what they all have in common? He had sex before he got married, and he got married within at most 2 weeks of meeting the person. Now when I say meet, I mean in person. Yet he has meet a couple ahead of time through friends and things, but they don't really count because the person can lie and you wouldn't know it. Anyway, he had sex before he got married and that got me to thinking.   Think about how many people on average get a divorce within 2 years, like me dad in pretty much all of his marriages. Now think about how many of them had sex before marriage. Do you see where I am going with this? Sex is not, I repeat, not a way of showing you love a person. It is only a way to pleasure you and your "mate". Yet many do not understand that and many don't even think about it. If you want to show true affection for one another, then don't have sex until your married. True love does not need sex! If your "mate" keeps trying to get it out of you, then there just may be no love there in the future. Why do I say this? Well I have lived 16 mothers without a real mother, and because of that I have time to reflect on my dads mistakes and the wife he is breaking up with to see what to avoid.   As far as I can tell, sex is the one thing that gets in the way of the love. I am sure many of you understand what I am getting at and some of you may not even care what I am saying. But I shall give you fair warning right now. Do not have sex until you are married! If you don't wish to do that then at least hold off for 3 to 6 months. Trust me, if this person really loves you and I mean truly, deeply loves you, then that person can wait a long time to have sex. Sex is not a big need in a successful relationship, it never was.   Anyway, I thought I would just come on out and talk to you about that. I just felt like doing so for it is who I am and I feel open to say it here. LOL! Anyway, I got to crash. Later!       Wolfwood

      Well, this is my first blog.&nbsp; And I intend it to not be my last. Before anything though, I guess I should introduce myself, sound good?  My name is Timothy, and I am currently in 11th grade. (Woot!) As for what I like to do, that is very very simple. I'm a complete out of this world computer geek. Pure and simple! Lately, I have been joining a lot of things that I would not normally join but I am currently saying "What the Hell!" Right? Anyway, that is all I shall share for right now. I will make another blog I guess tonight before I go to bed. That is if I remember to do so. LOL! Anyway, later!  Wolfwood

      I came across another site today and I must say that it is really shocking to me that their patents would even let them do such a thing. First off, it is fine if they teen models dress up in nice cloths and things like that, but when it comes to the point of wearing their panties and bathing suites that are mainly for 18+, I think it is just wrong.  The site is a top site for teenage or younger models, no nudity of course. But if my dad ever caught me there, he would think badly about it thinking I am doing it for pleasure rather then just surfing the web for fun to see what I can find and to get images to edit them on Photoshop. Anyway, the site is called  urlLink  Child Super Models  , or Preteen models as they put it. The model ages range from 10 and up, and what they say about what they wear is that compared to dancers wearing tights.  Dancers wear tights and things to show off their figure. So they say, we shall put them in swim suites to show off their figure. Okay, for those 13 and up that is perfectly fine. But 7 to 12, they have no figure yet really to show. And lets not forget, that a lot of people take sites like this pervertitaly. Anyway, do you know what I mean? I am just saying that models of such a young age should not be wearing G-string bathing suites, though the teens mainly wear that, and that the younger ones should only be modeling in full out clothing that is good for their age.  I don't know, it could be the way they have the site up that makes me uneasy about such a thing. They have it set up like it is a p*rn site or something where you have to be a member to see more pictures. If they are models, and they are under 18 then you don't need members. Such and thing should be member free because I believe that true models of this age do if for the fun and idea of being a model later on in their life. To join and have to pay for it just to see their model pictures, for one, makes it like a p*rn site, and two, just isn't right. Do you know what I mean now?  I hope you understand what I am getting at. But do say something so I can get your view on this. Sometimes my thoughts about such a thing are unsure and someone elses opinion helps to clear me up so I can think clearly and know why they are doing this.  Anyway, I need to go now. Later!

      You know what, this week is not so bad. I have gotten my old forum back up and running, The Hangout. But I closed Club Eight in the process. I knew a few days after opening that it would never lift off and I don't wish to waste time worrying about having it do so. Anyway, That is pretty much all about my day. I will get more elaberate about my days soon enough, don't worry. I just can't right now because I think Teen Titans is about to come on. (And yes, I know it is more like a kid show then a teen show. But I like it.)  Later!     Wolfwood

      Now if you never seen this site or even heard about it, then go there. This site is fantastic! I am not much into girl sites, but I must say that hers is just awsome. And her music is really, really good. I am surprised she has not gotten singing offers yet. Anyway, check the site out. The link is in the menu.     Wolfwood

      My new friend over at  urlLink Sometimes...  has been kind enough to link this site on hers. Yeah! That makes her the first to do so, and that makes me happy! :D LOL! Thanks a lot Rora!  Other then that, my day is like any other day. Just going to school, coming home and relaxing, only to end up doing homework again. LOL! I am looking forward to watching Family Guy tonight though, like every night now. Anything on Adult Swim I pretty much like to watch except Big O and this new show i think is coming on. I forget the name. Anyway, thats it for my day. Well, later!     Wolfwood

      Isn't it great! I finally learn some about the template and how the site is made up in code. So I was able to play around a bit, and do this and that. Now look what I have done. I added a banner to the site instead of that text. And I added some links to the side menu. I may do more later on but not right now. Isn't that cool, even though most of you know how to do it anyway. (D*mn you... LOL!) Well, later! I am going to watch some TV.     Wolfwood

      I am going to tell you right now that today has been a rough day for me at school. And now, I don't know what to do. I don't really fell like reading my summer reading and I think I won't. I don't even know if my teachers are going to do anything with it or not. I guess as long no one brings it up in Lit or something, then we shall be fine.  Anyway, it was the first day of school for me as a Junior. And I must say right now that I am already looking forward to Friday. And with college and the SAT coming up, man. I am really going to hate this year. Besides school though, everything here is just fine. Mom isn't feeling to well, of course with her being pregnant. And my new forum  urlLink  Club Eight   still hasn't lifted off the ground yet. But other then that, everything is just peachy.  Well, I am going to go now. There really isn't much to say when school on. But you can however read about my school day if you are so interested. Just go to my other Blog,  urlLink  A Students Life  . Alright? Well, cya!

      I have come across another great site yesterday thanks to Donna Gossett over at  urlLink  Chit Chat  . It is nice to see some serious thinkers here at Blog just like me though I do not put all my thoughts down here such as he does.  Two of his writings, I must say, did catch my eye. I would like to share them with you here.    Hurry Up &amp; Wait    Sometimes I get frustrated when I have to hurry and do something, only to find that I must then wait for it to be used. I'm starting to think a little differently though. I can see where God is doing, and has done, some things in my life that weren't used immediately. He prepares me, only to make me wait a while before they are used.  Why does He do this? I can offer a theory. He waits to see if I have faith. I may be prepared to do something, but if it is not combined with faith, He gets no glory. He waits to see if I have enough faith to trust His timing, or if I will strive to accomplish something on my own.   God's Control Room     I had the priviledge to be on an aircraft carrier yesterday for a family cruise that lasted 12 hours. As we toured the ship, we entered a 'control room' somewhere deep inside the craft. As we oohed and ahead over all of the computers, screens, radars, gauges and such, the wife of my sponsor said, "This is great, but can you imagine what God's control room looks like?".   What a thought! God controls this entire world (planets, galaxies, etc.) from His throne room, and He does it because He loves us. He could throw us away at any time, but He won't. In spite of what we do, He still wants us.   These two really made me think if there are such reasons behind what happens to us. Me, I seem to have a lot of bad luck come my way ever since I was maybe 13. I don't know why I have such bad luck, I might not have it at all yet I think I do. I don't know. But is God doing this to prepare me for something? If so, what could it be?  When I was younger, I would just lay in bed and think up reasons that may be behind why we are here, what reasons why we believe in God, and things of that sort. So far, I have come up with many thoughts, enough to make me want to right a book even. Yet in this world, such an action would only cause me trouble rather then to help others think.  Joe Cook at  urlLink  Peace 4 U  , this is where the passages came from, is a true person to have such a site. Among many, he is not afraid to share what he believes, thinks, and so on. Yet if you do such things as this off the computer and in the real world, you will find yourself being sued until death.  Some people in this world take such things a religion to far, others do not like Joe. Like the case about the Ten Commandments in front some government building. Other religions demanded that it should be taken down for it is against their religion and that they are not suppose to lay even their eyes upon it or something like that. Well I say, don't look at it! So what if it is not in your religion, this world here was founded by Christians. Like it or not, it stays. No one is forcing you to change religions, and no one is forcing you to look at it. So just move on and leave what we have in this world alone. If you like, put some of yours up!  Do you see? It only takes one person to mess up everything for all of us. Just one! This world is in the dark to far to ever see light now. And people wonder when god will ever come to take us home? Well, he will come when we all realize what we are doing. He will come when we all accept what other believe, think, do, and say. Christians believe that gays and lesbians are sinners for who they are, right? I say that the Christians are sinners for not accepting who they are in their search of happiness. Love comes in many ways people, not just with man and women but with the same sex too. I don't care if your gay or not, your still a person and I respect you for that.  Many don't believe this, but I think that because our world has changed so much that God to has changed to accept this world. That the sayings of god and how he is against gays has now left his mind to accept them. God loves all children, correct? Then leave gays along, for god loves them too no matter who they are. They didn't plan out this action people, God sent them on that road to find love.  Anyway, I am getting to deep into my discussion now. I have to cut off and go get something to eat. Later everyone!     Wolfwood

      Well I am back to my normal internet ways. I thought maybe some of you guys and gals that read my blog might want to know about my new forum. Join if you like, but you don't have too.

      Well, I must say that I am glad and not to happy about being back. The reason I am glad is because I am home and I have everything here and thins like that. But the reason why I am not happy about it either is because school starts this coming monday. :( What joy!!! (NOT!) lol!  Anyway, about Orlando. It was great!! We went to 3 parks, Universal, Islands, and Sea World within the week we had. I must say though, that the waiting in line sucked and that it was extremely hot while I was down there causing me to sweat like a dog, and I hate sweating! But other then me being a bit uncomfortable during the week, it was still rather nice to get on the rides and everthing.  I got some great footage with the video camera that I hope to soon show Grandma and Granddad, which just may happen with mom going down there for the next two weeks. Yet speaking of mom, Somthing happened over the week that I didn't expect and I am honestly not ready for.  You know how I was talking about new borns a few weeks ago, well mom is now pregnant. (And my dad hasn't even married her yet! She wants me to call her mom though so I do, thats why I am calling her mom even though she isn't quite yet.) And you know what is surprising, I too was born before my dad married my birth mother. And the chances are that this new child will be born in April, the same as when I was born. (HOLLY SH*T, that means I was concieved [SP?] in August or July! I never knew that.)  Just between you and me, I think she got pregnant on the vacation. I dare not say how though for I don't wish to think about it. We all shared the same room, this is the reason why. And really, it pisses me off if they did because they shouldn't be doing that. In fact, dad wanted to wait to tell grandma and granddad about them being pregnant, and that could be a reason why. But who knows, right. (They do, thats for sure.)  Anyway, that is my vacation in a nut shell. I will try and get some pictures of it all here if I can. Well, talk to you all later! Cya!     Wolfwood

      This week we held our very first Film Club meeting. And as it turns out, we have loads of people there this year more then the last 2 years that I, Tim, have been there. For those who missed today's meeting. I will give you the best summary about what Film Club is all about that I possibly can.  Well Film Club is pretty much what it sounds like. Only difference is that we don't make movies in the club, though you are highly welcome too and you can bring them in for us to watch. What we mainly do is sit around in the class room and watch movies while we eat pizza or whatever that we can get. Yet we do do more then just watch movies. We also hold a Film Festival about every year, from what I know of, to which people can watch movies, get refreshments, and whatever else there is to do there. And one time, last year, we even had movie under the stars where people could come and eat dinner while watching a movie at the school.  For the most part, we do a lot of things that involve movies and films. For more detailed info about the club, then just contact Nicholson at Milton. She can fill you in on your questions a lot better then I can. LOL!  Well, see ya!     Tim

      Though the work in school sucks, I hardly ever come home with homework. Yesturday for example, no homework. None at all. And today, all I have to do is study math a little and then do some scenteces for math which I shall do tomorrow. Other then that, I am having a good week.  Most of my classes though, are really good to students for we will hardly ever have homework so to speak. Like US History, Coach Web says we will never have homework for the most part because we will always do the work in class. In discrete math, the math is so easy you could finish the work in class.  So the only two classes I really have to worry about this sememster, is Physics and Language Arts. Pretty cool, huh?  Anyway, today has been a wierd day too. At lunch, I went to go sit down with my friends for lunch like every other day. And this girl out of no were comes, sits down, and starts talking to us out of the blue. Her friends behind her were laughing themselfs to death, so you could tell that it was a dare for some reason. Anyway, other then that, the day has been rather normal.  Well, got to run. I guess I should start studing some math. But I will do those scentences tomorrow during study hall. They should only take about 10 mins to do. Well, later!    Wolfwood

      I must say that today has been a great day. Why? NO HOMEWORK! YEAH! That means I have a lot more time to work on the web, watch TV, and things like that. Cool, huh?  I didn't do much at all that is very interesting. And in Physics, I must say that I am completely brain dead. I don't know why, I just can't think in there at all. It's strange. But all my other classes are going by rather well.  Plus, 24 FPS Film Club starts tomorrow. Yeah! This means that I get to watch movies for free, stay away from the house some, and maybe help out in the club with it's plays and things. I was never really active in the club in past years, but I want to stop that and be active these last two years. I may also look into some art clubs and see when they are active and things. Anyway, thats that.  Well, i am going to jet. Talk to you all later! Cya!

      I must say that today has been rough. For one thing, I can tell you right now that I do not like Physics so far. But everything else is just fine. However, other then then not much homework at all, it is still a busy task to remember all my classes work.  Anyway, I hope to get all my work organized this weekend. So I hope by then, things in school will be a bit easier. I can tell you this though, I am loving Math this year. My math teacher, G-Dog as she calls herself, rocks. And the class is loads of fun, that and the work is really easy. Anyway, got to run! Later!    Wolfwood

      You know, I went to the Trig teachers class room this morning before school started only to find out that she was in a meeting. And because of that, she didn't come to the classroom while I was there which means I would have been late to my Homeroom if I didn't leave when I did. How great is that, right?  Anyway, today wasn't so bad. Though it was a bit boring and I was dozing off in Physics today, it wasn't to bad. The school computer dude finally got our logins working so we can now get in to the school network there and do some actual web design work. Plus, I have some homework that is not due until Monday which means I get a free day in those classes tomorrow, Yeah!  Besides today, tonight hasn't been bad for homework either. I managed to type a really good, or what I think is really good, essay for class tomorrow. (I'm one of those last minute doers... lol) So i hope i get some good comments about it and a good grade. Otherwise, I am screwed! LOL! Anyway, I am going to go now. Later!    Wolfwood

      You know this is the third day when our Physics teacher has reviewed past math with us!? I mean he even gave us 5 problems on it to convert millimeters to kilometters and things like that. Man, that is now getting old fast. I hope we get to normal teachings soon before I blow.  Anyway, I am going to do those problems tomorrow in homeroom or later tonight. They should be really simple so they should only take about 5 mins to do. Then I have a little language arts to do that will only take 3 mins or so. I can do all that tomorrow but just in case, I may do the physics tonight before I crash.  Anyway, the rest of the day was cool. I got on CollegeBoard.com so look for some good colleges and I must say that there system for searching is not very effective. The search takes all the majors and thinks that I am talking about one college insteal of several. They should have it so that they take each major and see which college does it best. Then we should do the research to see what is better to our needs. To be honest with ya, I like GCIC or whatever better. They have more life like questions that made searching for a college much easier.  Anyway, I did the search there way doing only small amount searchs and I think I came out with 6 or 5 possible colleges to go to. They should all be under $15,000 for out of state which I think is rather good. I need to talk to my dad though to see how much he would like to spend for college and how much he can. It is going to take a lot of work and questions, but I know I will find something sooner or later.  Anyway, that is enough for today. I am going to go watch some TV now. Later!    Wolfwood

      Well, today wasn't so bad as yesturday. I do have good news though, and that is I am going to go with Discrete Math instead of Andvanced Algebra! Why? Because it is a hell lot easier as far as I can tell. So this will give me some time to relax my head for college and things and to review maybe some things I might have forgotten how to do long ago. Plus, the teacher isn't going to give us a load of homework. Yeah!  Yet I am still unsure about what class I'm suppose to take and I guess I will find out maybe tomorrow or so. But as of right now, I am going to hold off on returning the book until Thursday. I think that after this week, you can no longer change classes and then I can just relax an go with the flow. Because if I am not mistaken, by failing Algebra 2 second smemester, I should be in Discrete. But I no longer know now because this year is pretty confusing. (God is testing me, I know it. He is always doing this to me and he never stops with me. I never had a break ever since Middle. Ahh!)  Anyway, the rest of my classes are cool. I think I may like American History a bit more then others. But then again, there is always Web Site design and Comercial Design too. It's a hard choice, huh? LOL!  Well, got to go. I am going to surf some and then relax. I am not going to read my summer reading until maybe this Friday because none of my classes have said anything about it yet. In fact, I think they forgot about it completely which is a good thing. Well, later!    Wolfwood

      Man what a rough day, and its the first day! I will tell you what, this is the first "first day" of school that had to be my worst yet best too.  For starters, the day starts off well with American History and Website Design. Okay, no biggy. Then comes Physics, and yeah it doesn't seem to bad. It sure as hell shouldn't be worse then Chemistry, right? Anyway, I later on learn that I am going to Advanced Algebra &amp; Trig for 4th period! Boy what a jump from failing Algebra 2 second semester to Trig! Anyway, I go about my day and then I come to Language Arts and then finally Spanish 2. Okay, something is most def. not right here. I mean last year, I failed Second semester Spanish too. And from what my teacher said back then, I will not go to Spanish 2 until I complete Spanish 1 with a passing grade.  Well the teacher comes around and I tell her my problem. I then learn that I am not suppose to be in that class so I go to the councilors office to have everything settled down. While I was there, I asked him whether or not if I am suppose to be in discreet Math rather then Trig. He says he doesn't know, but he put in the class any so I no longer have Trig for this year. But he did say that I should go and ask the math teacher if such a thing needs to be done because of me failing Algebra 2. By gods great power and wisdom, I hope he is right. Because I myself know that I am not ready to go into Trig right now anyway. I mean don't get me wrong, it is okay if I do end up going. It's just that I might not stay in the B's in that class because I didn't get Algrebra so well. Understand?  Anyway, my day was, on average, an neutral day. LOL! Well, now I have to go. So I guess I shall talk to you guys and gals later.  P.S. If anyone would like to join, then let me know or do so. I don't know how the member thing works here but it would be cool to have at least 2 other schoolers here to share their day. You know, to ad some variety. LOL! Later!    Wolfwood
