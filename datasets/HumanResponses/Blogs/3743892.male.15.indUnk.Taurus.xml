      Thanks so much you guys for your humerous posts on my blogspot.  You guys really are the reason I keep going.  Make sure you tell everyone you meet about my site.  I like publicity.  Chris, about your most recent comment, you really got told by those girls.  I say you need to work on your charisma a little more.  Well, I hope your cheek doesn't hurt too much.  And don't worry, I'll get to your blackbird model as soon as I can.  I just finished the F-35 (thanks Ben, it looks great!) and then I have to do my F-22 model that my dad gave me.  That should take me about a week to finish.  Then it's your model!  I should finish it by the end of the summer no problem.  As for you Ben, good luck on your new job.  Sounds like fun!  And for all those who are looking at my site wondering who the heck Ben and Chris are, just leave it at this:  YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW...just kidding.  They're great guys.  I really hope you meet someone like them.  And for EVERYONE looking at this blogspot, POST A COMMENT!!!!  I love to know what people are thinking.  Just tell me!  Well, that's all for now folks!

      Well, here I am, typing from the local library in Long Beach Island.  So far, I've been golfing (autrocious, never again), swimming, skimboarding, mini golfing, biking, to the arcade, and I've met no hot girls.  Plenty of them walking around (certainly more than Brookfield), but I can't get the nerve to talk to the few that don't already have boyfriends.  Oh, well.  That's not what I'm here for, right?......Oh, heck.  Who am I kidding?  Of course that's what I'm here for!  Well, the library's closing now, so I gotta go.  Just saying hi to all my buddies back at Brookfield.  This is Kyle, saying "If they give you cash, it's just as good as money" (Yogi Berra).

      Well, this year's summer is probably the busiest summer I've ever had (unlike Chris over there).  It's crazy and hectic.  I'm home for a total of about 6 days in July.  I'm going to wrestling camp first, then Boy Scout camp (lots of fun despite the stereotype).  Then my mom and I are going to Paris and Italy for about a week and a half.  Then I'm home for a week in August and then football starts. 9-3 every day for weeks.  I'm SO BUSY!!! AARRRGG!!  Well, I guess I won't be rotting away like Chris.  Hope all who read this have a good summer as well.  This is Kyle saying, "If you get miss work 'cause you get hurt, it won't hurt to miss work!" (wha..?)

      I'm working hard today on a model of a marine's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.  It should come out pretty cool.  The instructions are very helpful, unlike some other models I've seen.  If you want to see a picture of an F-35, just click here:  urlLink F-35 Picture

      If you have ever played Halo for X-box (most of you probably have), you like comedy and you can take a little foul language, then do I have the site for you.  Go to  urlLink www.redvsblue.com .  A group of guys update it weekly.  What they do is they play a multiplayer in Halo, and add their own voices  to it.  Each person making the videos is a different character.  It's  SO  funny.  Check it out.  You'll probably like it.  Oh, and by the way, try to start from the beginning with Episode 1, Season 1.  It will be much funnier if you know what is going on.  You'll also get some of the jokes that refer back to earlier episodes.  Ok. Hope you like it.

      As the first few days of summer went by, it really didn't feel like summer.  But now that we've been out of school for a while and it's been pretty hot, I think it's starting to kick in that summer feel.  As for summer, I'm going to Long Beach Island on Friday (yes!! hot girls on beaches!!).  It should be fun.  I get to golfing with my dad too.  I love golfing.  Actually, I pretty much love all sports, except soccer.  Too much repetition.  Anyways, I also just got a new 14-foot trampoline.  Great fun.  I can jump pretty high, at least higher than I've seen anyone else go.  Well, I'm blabbing, so I'll let you get back to your life now.  This is Kyle saying, "It is high, it is far, it...is...GONE!!!! Yankees win!  The-e-e-e-e-e yankees win!!!!"

      For my first post, I have to tell everyone that reads this that I LOVE the Giants.  I could talk about the Giants or football in general for hours.  Wanna talk?  My email is giantsfan5689@cs.com.

      Well,&nbsp;I am really excited right now.&nbsp; My family just got our first new car since 1995.&nbsp; It is SO awesome.&nbsp; We got an sage green&nbsp;Acura MDX.   Here's a picture of a silver one:     It has a DVD player that has a hookup for a video game system.&nbsp; Sweet.&nbsp; It also has a third row of seats, heated front seats, a trip computer in the front dash, and rear-control a/c or heat.&nbsp; Also very cool.&nbsp; It also has leather seats, something we never had in the 1995 GMC Yukon we're going to sell.&nbsp; I'll miss it, but we have to move onto bigger and better things!&nbsp; (The Yukon&nbsp;didn't even have a CD player).   Well, I'm off to Vermont (a five hour drive in our new car!  DVD's, here I come!) and then to Europe for a week.  I'll be back the beginning of the second week of August.  See y'all later!

      Well, I'm back from the beating the rest of my teammates and I have taken at the wrestling camp I just came back from in Pennsylvania.&nbsp; If you ever join wrestling and ever get the chance to wrestle anyone from Pennsylvania, Iowa, Ohio, or any other&nbsp;corn belt&nbsp;state, RUN AWAY VERY FAST.&nbsp; Just to give you an idea of how hard it was: -I have been wrestling for 4 years, and my record was 2-10. -Our senior captain Doug was pinned for his first time ever in a varsity match &nbsp; On another note, I have to go to Boy Scout Camp this week (I leave tomorrow).&nbsp; That is a little less physical.&nbsp; It's fun though, despite all of the Boy Scout stereotypes. &nbsp; Well, hope everyone is doing well and living happily ever after. &nbsp;

      I just got back from seeing Spiderman 2 with Ben.  It is a really good movie.  Doc. Oc. is probably my favorite villan of any movie.  His costume and extra arms are really cool.  You should see this movie, but see the first one first if you haven't already.  It really helps.  I was explaning almost the whole first movie to my mom just so she could understand some parts from the second one.  As an added note, I will have my quotes on the bottom of the sidebar on the left now, instead of on the bottom of some posts.  I will try to update it every week.

      Well, tomorrow I have to say goodbye to my PS2 for a while.  I'm going to be sending it away to be fixed (It doesn't play DVD's or blue-backed discs).  Fortunatly, I'll be gone at either wrestling camp or Boy Scout camp for two weeks, so I won't miss it too much.  If I don't post a lot in the next two or three weeks, it's because I'm either at scout camp, wrestling camp, or in Paris or Rome with my mom.  In other news, I'm still bored for the rest of the week before I have to leave for wrestling camp.  SOMEONE PLEASE CALL ME AND INVITE ME OVER!  I need to get away from this place.  Otherwise I'll get even more attached to my PS2 before it has to go.  If anyone wants to come over my house too, we can go on my new trampoline.  My bro and I have come up with a few cool games, so we can do that.  Well, gotta go and vege out on the PS2 now.

      In the News Times this morning, it said that Maria Sharapova is coming to New Haven in a month or so to participate in the Pilot Pen tennis tournament!  Yay!  Maybe I'll go watch her.  Hope she wins!  In other news, I am bored.  I need something to do other that jump on my trampoline all day.  It's pretty fun, but not all day.  PLEASE someone call me and invite me over.  Anyways, this is Kyle saying, "Maria Sharapova is hot!"...I mean, no wait.  That wasn't the quote of the day.  Oops...This is Kyle saying "Be vewy, vewy quiet.  We'wre hunting wabbits"

      Yesterday, Ben and I went to an Air Force air show. It was really cool, and really blurry, and whoa, I feel lightheaded.........ok, sorry, I'm back. I just fainted. Actually I didn't faint, but Ben did!!!! It was really kinda funny. We had been waiting for about a half hour for the Thunderbirds (those are the airplanes that did the show) to take off, and just as they were about to take off, Ben faints. It was TERRIBLE TIMING!!!! They took off as everyone was helping him come to and get up.  But anyways, he eventually got up, and we got to watch the show. It was pretty good, but not the best I've seen, partly because there were clouds everywhere, which forced the Thunderbirds to stay lower and they couldn't do as many tricks. But it was still awesome. Incase you don't know what a Thunderbird is, here's a pic of one:   From the top:     From the side:    Just look how close together they are!!! It really is amazing what they do. If you ever get to see a Blue Angel show (like the Thunderbirds, except they're from the Navy and a slightly different airplane), they're really good too, and sometimes better. Here's a pic of one:     But anyways, it was a great show, and we got a bunch of laughs about Ben (of course, we're ALWAYS laughing at Ben!). If you ever get the chance to see an air show, GO. I MEAN IT. JUST GO..........well?............GO ALREADY!!!!!

      Well, this post is pretty self-explanitory...but, I'm back from my 2 1/2 week road/airplane trip!! I read all three of my summer reading books during the 17 total hours I spent on the plane to and from Europe (haha, I laugh at all who still have reading to do :). Well, not much else to say, except that I recieved my PS2 from Sony, and it's NOT FIXED!!!!!! *sigh* Oh well, guess I'll just have to send it back again some other time. Because it's warrantied, I don't have to pay for a fixing, so that's a plus. Well, good to be back.

Anyways, if you want to take a peek at the giants schedule, just go to  urlLink www.nfl.com , click on the Giants link on the top of the screen, and look for the schedule on the Giants' page.  Or you can just look at the whole combined NFL schedule on the nfl.com page.  It should be a great turnaround year from their horendous previous seasen.  Well, if you want to go to a game, just let me know, since I'm going to at least 3 games this season.  GO GIANTS!!!!!

      Hey everyone! Let me just warn you, this is a really long post!  Sorry! I'm typing this post on a really weird keyboard in Rome! It's about 5 pm here, even though the timestamp says 11 am (that's your time!). My trip is almost finished (we have only one more day, and we don't know what to do with it since we've seen almost everything). We have seen everything there is to see in both Paris and Rome. We have climbed the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe, been inside Notre Dame and the Vatican; saw the Sistine Chapel, Napoleon's Tomb, and the Pantheon (a church built in the year 120 and still standing!); and walked the circumfrence of the Colusseum and through the Roman Forum (the ruins of the political center of the early Roman Empire). These have all been totally awe-inspiring and all uniquely amazing in their own way. There is no possible way to choose a favorite place, although it is safe to say that I like Paris a little better than Rome because it is much cleaner, safer, and overall more beautiful. The French take pride in how much work they put into making their city a more beautiful place. I've had so much fun and seen so many different things. A little blurb about my favorites incase you don't know what they are:  The Eiffel Tower: I'm assuming everyone knows what this is.  The Arc de Triomphe: In Paris. An arc comissioned by Napoleon and finished about 20 years later (in the 1830's) which houses the tomb of the French unknown soldier.  Notre Dame: In Paris. A gothic style renaissance church, arguably one of the most famous in the world. A huge architectural wonder. It is huge for a church.  The Vatican/Sistine Chapel/St. Peter's Square: All in Rome. The Vatican is the country where the pope lives (the smallest country in the world, smack in the middle of Rome). The Sistine Chapel is in the Vatican, and is where Michaelangelo painted the story of the creation of man, you know, the naked fugure of Adam reaching out to touch the hand of God. St. Peter's Square is where the pope's official church is. The church itself is enormous. You could never imagine how big it is. It also houses Michaelangelo's sculpture  the Pieta , the one with Mary holding the body of Christ.  Napoleon's Tomb: In Paris. Napoleon is encased in six seperate expensive casquets.  The Pantheon: In Rome. It is the church I told you about before, the one built in the year 120 and still standing fine. It houses the tomb of the painter/sculpter Raphael.  The Colusseum/Roman Forum: In Rome. The colusseum most of you have probably heard of, but just incase, it is a half a stadium from the Roman Empire, built in 76 A.D. to house gladiatorial fights and executions. It could hold  almost 300,000 people!!!!!  That's about 2 times as many people as modern football stadiums!! It had lots of ingenious teclnological advances for that time, including a retractible roof and stadium floor, trap doors in the stadium floor to bring up wild animals with, and so on. The Roman Forum is on a hill next to the Colusseum and, as I mentioned before, is the ruins of the political center of the Roman Empire (i.e. Nero had his palace on that hill where the Forum is situated).  Well, sorry to bore you with all this info, but I hope you enjoyed it. It is just a scratch on the surface compared to how much we learned on this trip. If you want to know more, just ask me when I get home from Vermont next week (I'm flying directly from here to Vermont to visit my grandparents). See y'all later!
