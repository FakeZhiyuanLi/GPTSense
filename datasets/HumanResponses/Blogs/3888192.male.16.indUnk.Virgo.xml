      There's always something in the way There's always something getting through But it's not me It's You It's You  Sometime's ignorance Rings true But hope is not in what I know It's not in me It's in You It's in You  It's all I know It's all I know It's all I know  And I find peace when I'm confused I find hope when I'm let down Not in me, Me, In You In You  I hope to lose myself for good I hope to find it in the end Not in me Me, In You In You  It's all I know It's all I know It's all I know  In You In You In You In You  It's always something in the way There's something getting through  It's not me  It's you It's you It's you It's you It's you It's all i know It's you It's you It's all i know

      i was listening to parokya ni edgar's "your song" and i was really enlightened by the lyrics of the song...i just want to fall in love again...like the first line was "i took one look and forever lay out of me"...well i was kinda happy that i'm FINALLY RECOVERED from my last relationship but the sad thing was...i'm still sick...i kinda lose myself all day...i could think much and couldn't focus in one thing...last night  i kinda dreamt myself that i was in ua&p, eating lunch with my friends then my imaginary crush passes by...and by the time she passed, i just forgot everything and i mean everything...the place i'm in, the friends surrounding me...the topic were discussion...everything...everytime she passes by i always feel that way...i really don't know why...sometimes in dreams i just wanted to stay and never wake up and see another day...

      It took one look and forever lay out in front of me  One smile then I die  only to be revived by you  There I was thought I had everything  figured that  goes to show there too much I know bout the way life plays out  Chorus: i take one step away and I find myself coming back to you my one and only one and only you..  Now I know that I've known lot of things at all except the fact that I am yours  and that you are mine  Oh, if you told me that it wouldn't be easy and Oh, I'm not one to complain  repeat chorus (except the last word)  repeat chorus

      someone tore your heart... you felt the emptiness of your soul... can't you see the pain... of something you've longed for so long...  you think about her night and day...  and you couldn't get her out of your head... you spend nights mourning... you spend days crying...  still, you hear her words inside your head... and you couldn't take the pain... you've tried ending your life because of her... mainly you haven't felt heartbreak for a while...  months passed by and still, you want to talk to her... be with her... but you just couldn't...  just couldn't... accept the fact the she's gone...  you hear tunes on the radio... reminds of you and her togethter... it just makes you cry but you have to... you have to...  years passed by... you see her with a another man... holding hands...  and they passed by to you without calling your name... you just felt in-shock...

      sometimes i felt short...  as if i fall onto the ground so many times... i just couldn't let my feelings show... when my heart fell head over hills over her...  sometimes i see lines in my head... as if my heart would beat once more... for sometime i couldn't stop thinking about her... cuz all i could think about is how she makes me smile...  i tried so hard pretending to know what i was suppose to feel... but suddenly my heart begins to stop... i just feel the emptiness of something that i couldn't let go... but i know i need to let it show...  i just took my time... searching for words... words that would make her feel better... better in a nice way...  i look upon her face... as i see her deep blue eyes staring back at me... with his charming smile cudding with mine... and her sweet soft voice that makes me go oh oh...  i just began being speechless... i forgot everything i have to say... i forgot everything around me except her... i hold her hand and  say...  i just couldn't live without you because i love you...

      i may seem to look childish  but i know my life works i may not be that person who smiles but i'll try my best to make your day  i hear songs inside my mind as lines picks up melody i write them on a piece of paper  and all i could think about is heartbreak  sometimes my mind's confuse  and just let if fly around sometimes my heart's alone and just tried to keep on beating  for some time now i rest for something i never tried before loving someone like writing a song on a piece of paper that never ends

      hindi ko kayang mag-isa na bigla ka na lang mawawala di ko ninais sabihin ang tunay kong saloobin  tumigil ang oras biglang pumatak ang ulan kasabay ko ang pagyakap sa unan nakahigang nakaposas  pinikit ko ang aking mga mata at nakita kong may kasama kang iba puso ko'y nagdurugo  bigla na lang itong nadurog  lumipas ang taon  humanap ng pagkakataon ngunit pinigil ko ang sarili na makasama ka muli  ngayo'y tapos na  ako'y malaya na ika'y isang panaginip na aking itinabi

      well here it goes... it all started when kuya third texted me that he was in ever gotesco... so i told him that i'll be there in a couple of minutes i think i told him to wait aroung 15 to 30 minutes because i will take a bath... so after i took a bath it rained so hard that even i couldn't go out because of the hard rain so i waited for a couple of minutes then i rode a tricycle going to ever and went to amf puyat... there i saw kuya third playing billards alone so he invited me to play but several minutes after i arrrived kim and vannie showed up while me and kuya third were playing billards so they waited for us to finish the game then by the time we finished the game twinkle showed up together with her yaya but her yaya didn't join us i think she let her go home... so kuya third invited them as well playing a bi-gender game since kim doesn't know how to play, twinkle and me were paired up and kuya third was paired to ate vannie so we played the first game and won, guess who won the game... me and twinkle, twinkle made her shot so that's it... we played a couple of games then we ended up 1-1 or 1-2 scoring... so we left the billard table and asked us where will be heading next so we headed to magoos pizza and ate merienda then charles, cris, and ate rita arrived as well damn cris looked so cute and my heart fell head over hills over her...and were planning where to eat for dinner... so i told them "world topps" so we walked from ever to world topps... while ordering, me, kuya third, cris and twinkle ate inihaw na liempo while charles, kim, vannie and rita ate different food... so after dinner i remembered they wanted to have a guitar there so i thought of bringing my guitar there and i told kuya third that i'll go back home to get my guitar so charles and kim accompanied me of going back but while going back, charles was out of his mind, not making the u-turn in the right direction...instead he u-turned the wrong way but anyhow we reached home...so when we arrived home...i let them in and we saw ate mac still there taking care of kuya nair because he has a fever...so i packed up my guitar and collected some song hits from my collection and i showed them kuya chie's and kuya nair's room...they told me that they have so much toys but anyway, we went to vannie's house to do rounds...hell it was fun..we played indian poker then we all started to dicuss about love...i learned so much about the dicussion and i really do admired kuya third by telling us his side of the story between him and what he feels for his girlfriend...so much touching and in the same time very educational, we lasted for about 3-4 hours with the same topic...which is to be a debate...but anyway...i'm still young but with those of inspirational stories, i learned a lot and i realized that i have a long way to go...so it's about 1 am in the morning and i told them i'll leave at around 1:30 so i told them that i would be taking pictures before i leave and then we took 3 pictures...1 group pic - without me of course because i was the one who took the pic - 1 group pic - with me this time and kevin took the pic and i asked kevin to take a pic of me and cris so i have a cris-cy 5.5...i left with kevin because he took me home and learned some new stories and then i arrived home... part three's next...

      well, i guess this would be my first posting... um... im kinda new to this stuff but i will try my best to keep myself posted in the following days... well, ill try to learn this thing first then i'm good to go.. hehe charing!!!  well, i slept around 2:30 am awhile ago making and transferring notes because i have a really really messy notebook that's why i got low grades since my first days of college... um... since i have organize notes as of the moment, ill try my best to keep it clean and neat, that's why im using a mechanical pencil but what the heck!!!  i woke up around 7:30 because i want to play basketball in ateneo with my friends in days with the lord so arrive there early and then suddenly my earth began to shatter... i didn't know that there is a milo best clinic there so while waiting for the others to come, i continue writing notes, is better to wait for something than doing nothing right? then charles or we call him w.c.l white chinese lizard together with josh, since they saw a halfcourt there and no one is playing, we played there for several minutes and the guard kicked us out of the college covered courts then we went to the high school covered courts them on the way there... kuya third texted me that the courts there are full so he said that we should try waiting for a clear and open court. since no court is open, kuya third challenge the guys for a 3 on 3 game so at least we played for about 30 mins then we lost by a point... but anyway, me, kuya third, wcl and josh played 2 on 2 but we were run out of gas so there... we finished the game then we rested for some minutes then went home... so i guess this would be my part one... part two will be tonight because i'll have a bowling game with my friends here sa ever then dinner...
