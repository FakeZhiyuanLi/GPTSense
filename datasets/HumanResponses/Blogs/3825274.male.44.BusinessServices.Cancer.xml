MEDS-80  PO BOX 1035 COLUMBIA, MO  65205-1035  EXCERPTS:    Those wild and wacky government officials have once again come up with a NEW benefit for Medicare Beneficiaries…  or have they?  The truth about the new Medicare Prescription Drug Card Programs (2004 and 2005) and the new Medicare Prescription Drug Insurance (called Medicare Part D – which is to be available in 2006).  The first thing that you have to figure out is whether or not you qualify for the $600 credit that is available to low-income Medicare Beneficiaries if you buy one of the Medicare Prescription Drug Cards.  Most people don't qualify.    So, do you qualify for the $600 credit under a prescription drug card plan?  In 2004, for singles, your income can be no more than $12,569. In 2004, for married couples, income can be no more than $16,862.    According to a recent research poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, there is generally mass confusion concerning these new Prescription benefits in the Medicare program.  The bottom line “score” of the poll wound up being 36 (0 meaning very negatively viewed and 100 being most positively viewed).  In other words, the overall reaction, once the facts are revealed, is still decidedly negative.  The entire survey can be viewed online.  Go to:   urlLink  http://www.kff.org/medicare/   Here is a chart, published April, 2004 by the Minority Staff Committee On Government Reform – U.S. House of Representatives.        The entire report can be found, in Adobe Acrobat format, by  urlLink CLICKING HERE!   The chart above is comparing 10 drugs purchased in one month from an average Canadian Pharmacy, and through 3 of the new Medicare Prescription Drug Card programs – Walgreens, RxSavings and Pharmacy Care Alliance (PCA).  The committee found that those 3 cards were fairly typical and closely represented all of the Prescription Drug Cards being offered through the program.  The average drug card price was 72% higher than Canadian purchases.  Walgreens’ Card had the lowest prices overall of the three, but were were still 60% higher than Canadian prices.    Here are some specific examples from the study:  Celebrex, the arthritis drug was priced at $81.28 with the Walgreens’ Medicare approved Prescription Drug Card, whereas the Canadian purchase of the exact same drug was only $38.69.  Prevacid, the ulcer medication, cost $129.68 with the PCA card – the Canadian price for Prevacid was only $56.54.  There are many meds available from Canada for less than half of the best price through the “cards.”    Though many Seniors could benefit from regular monthly prescription meds bought from Canada, in actuality, anyone with regular prescriptions, at any age, should check into the savings from Canadian purchases of their meds.  For example, in Columbia, Missouri, I did a comparison of Birth Control pills (Ortho Tri-cyclen, 28 tablets per month).  When checking a 3 month supply ( 3 - 28tb packs), even after a shipping charge, it was only about $58 from the Canadian Pharmacy, compared to well over $120 from Walgreens, Osco Drug and Gerbes Pharmacy.  Even the lowest generic price for birth control pills (Trimessa) was over $96.  The Canadian prices are more than a 50% savings on the Brand name and over 30% savings even compared to the generic version.    This indicates that purchasing from Canada may very well make sense for anyone on any regular monthly prescription.  It is an option that everyone should at least check out.    The bottom line consensus of the House Minority Report is that Americans are most often better off buying their prescription drugs from Canada, as long as it is a real licensed Canadian pharmacy with a real licensed Pharmacist.     urlLink  CLICK HERE FOR A SOURCE THAT I'VE FOUND WHICH IS A LEGITIMATE CANADIAN PHARMACY   What are the benefits in the 2006 Prescription Drug Insurance (Part D) if you purchase it? This information was extracted directly from the Official Medicare Website:  www.medicare.gov  FIRST TIER – THE DEDUCTIBLE You will pay a $250 annual deductible – so you pay for the first $250 worth of prescriptions that you buy.  Add to that the $420 (or more) premium you pay, and you are already out $670 before Medicare Part D pays a dime.    SECOND TIER – THE 75/25 COINSURANCE For the next $2000 in prescription drug costs during that year, Medicare Part D would pay 75%, and you would pay 25%.  So, at this point, if you had $2250 worth of prescription drug costs for the year, Medicare Part D would have paid $1500 (75% of $2000) – you would have paid the $420 premium (or more), the $250 deductible and $500 coinsurance (25% of $2000).       	SIDENOTE:  In essence, Medicare Part D paid a net for your benefit of $1080  	(They paid $1500, but you paid them $420 (or more) premium - $1500-$420=$1080 net benefit).     THIRD TIER – THE DOUGHNUT HOLE For any annual prescription drug costs between $2250 and $5100 (that’s the next $2850) Medicare Part D pays nothing (zip, zilch, nada, zero) and you pay 100% (as in, all of it).  So, if your med costs for the year reached exactly $5100, Medicare Part D would have paid $1500 (75% of $2000), and you would pay the $420 premium (or more) + the $250 deductible + the $500 coinsurance (25% of $2000) + the full $2850 doughnut hole, for a total of $4020.   	SIDENOTE: The Medicare literature says that at this point your out of pocket expense is now at $3600, but of course, you also paid the $420 (or more) premium, right?   FOURTH TIER – THE 95/5 COINSURANCE Once your out of pocket expense reaches $3600, which is $250 deductible, plus $500 coinsurance (25% of $2000) and the $2850 doughnut hole (you pay 100%), Medicare Part D will then pay for 95% of the prescription drugs that year and you pay just 5%.  Again, from the sidenote above, don’t forget that you also paid that $420 premium.  So, if your costs were exactly $5100, you have paid the $3600 +$420, or $4020, but good ol’ Medicare Part D has paid $1080 net (They paid $1500, but you paid them at least $420 in premium).  That amounts to Medicare Part D paying for just a little over 21% of your drug costs.  So, if your drug costs are around $400 per month, then Part D of Medicare will help you a little (21%).    But, if your prescription drug costs are over $5100 per year, Medicare Part D will be picking up 95% of the costs.    For a HUGE example, let’s say that your prescription drug costs are $1000 per month.  That’s $12,000 for the year.    At the $5100 level, again, you would have paid out $3600 (deductible, coinsurance and doughnut hole), plus $420 (or more) for your Part D premium.  But, at $12,000 worth of prescriptions, Part D is going to pay for 95% of your meds after the first $5100, so that would be 95% of $6900, or $6555.  You would pay 5% of the $6900 which is $345.    So, with $12000 worth of annual prescriptions, Medicare Part D has paid out $1080 (on the first $5100) and $6555 (on the next $6900) for a total of $7635.  You have paid out $420  (or more) premium + $500 (25% co-pay on $2000) + $2850 doughnut hole + $345 (5% co-pay on $6900) for a total of $3865.    So, will the 2006 Part D of Medicare help you if you opt in?  That’s a good question.  If you are paying over $400 per month for your prescriptions, it MAY be a good deal for you.    Here’s an interesting thought.  What level of expenditure would I have to reach for the Medicare Part D to have actually paid at least half of my drug bills?  Isn’t math fun?  ;-)   Here Medicare is talking of coinsurance levels where they pay 75% and 95%, and yet when doing the real complicated math here, you have to spend OVER $8000 per year on prescription drugs before Medicare Part D gets to the point where they’ve paid even HALF of your costs.    This whole Medicare Prescription Card and Insurance deal reminds me of 1986.  Seniors, including backing by the AARP begged for Catastrophic Coverage under Medicare.  Congress passed the Medicare Catastrophic Act of 1986, then when the Seniors found out what they were getting BEGGED TO HAVE IT REPEALED, and it was.  It seems that when the Seniors found out that they HAD TO PAY FOR THE EXTRA COVERAGE, they didn't want it!  Well, imagine what is going to happen with this so-called MEDICARE PART D (Prescription Insurance) when Seniors find out what it is going to cost them!
