        i recently received a flyer that opened my eyes.  It was titled: " Boycott IAMS" .  it had a picture of an adorable little puppy and next to it a caption that read "IAMdead" the flyer was encouraging the boycott of the famous pet food company IAMS.  I was in tears as i read this for the first time.  it read as follows: "  If you love dogs and cats, don't buy IAMS.  the happy dogs bounding across a field in IAMS dog-food commercials are light-years away from dogs in the laboratory that IAMS hired to conduct nutritional studies.  an undercover investigator for PETA took a job in the lab and found the following:    *workers talking about DOGS LYING DEAD IN THEIR CAGES.    *DARK, DUNGEON-LIKE KENNELS that were stifling in the summer and frigid in the winter.    *DOGS CIRCLING ENDLESSLY IN THEIR SMALL PRISONS from loneliness and boredom.    *DOGS DUMPED ONTO COLD CONCRETE flooring after large chunks of muscle were CUT FROM THEIR THIGHS    *A PROCEDURE IN WHICH TUBES WOULD BE STUCK DOWN DOGS' THROATS to force them to ingest vegetable oil.    *dogs with such severe tartar buildup on their teeth that it was PAINFUL FOR THEM TO EAT.    *VETERINARY TECHNICIANS WITH INADEQUATE TRAINING and inexperienced in performing invasive procedures.  Our investigator videotaped IAMS representatives visiting the laboratory, witnessing the animals in these dreadful conditions-and doing nothing.  Even her pleas that the dogs be given resting boards, toys, and the socialization that they so desperately needed were ignored.  To her horror, the lab director oven ordered that the dogs' VOCAL CHORDS BE CUT BECAUSE THEIR FRIGHTENED AND LONELY BARKING IRRITATED HIM.  when PETA went public with this evidence, IAMS officials lied and said that they had no idea what conditions were like inside the laboratory that their own staff regularly visited!  IAMS then cuts ties with the lab.But IAMS and it's owner Proctor& Gamble, still do business with dozens of outside laboratories that might be just as bad as the one that we investigated. IAMS ALSO CONDUCTS STUDIES ON DOGS AND CATS IN ITS OWN FACILITY, WHICH IT REFUSES TO ALLOW PETA REPRESENTATIVES TO SEE. "   Well, it's disappointing to see that mankind will never change.  i can't see how anyone can possibly do that to innocent creatures.  when i passed this flyer around to people i knew i was even more surprised to see that most of them DID NOT CARE.  it saddens me to know that people are so selfish they can't see beyond their world.
