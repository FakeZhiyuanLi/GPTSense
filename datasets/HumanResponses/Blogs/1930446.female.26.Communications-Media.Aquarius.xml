      I hate my parents' computer.  I had this huge post written out about Vegas with every little detail I could think of, and then the computer died.  Damn.  So, all you get to know is 1. I'm not married 2. I got pretty drunk 3. I required 4 days to recover  :)

      Hey friends,  First, a mini-rant about Blogger.  Why does it send you to the "post a message" page b/f it sends you to the "snoop on everyone else" page?  Maybe we should have talked about this in class....  Second, and far more importantly, new deets:  New cell: 416 722 6207 New home: 416 963 8559 (at least until May 31) New work : 416 941 8107 (at least until May 25ish)  I'm officially in TO for the summer.  If you're around, drop by,  Mi casa es su casa.  Live from Toronto, Carrie

      So I think I might be crazy. I got a great job and I turned it down to go gallavanting around the world. See what J-skool does to your mental capacity?

      I'm going to be extra nerdy for a minute here.  I bought a book at Chapters last weekend that could be helpful to those of us still trying to find a job.  It's called   urlLink Work It!   (the cheesy exclamation point is theirs, not mine), and it's by Allison Hemming.  Since I have nothing better to do, I read it this week.  It's got some helpful job hunting tips, so if you're looking for that, or for an action plan, it could be useful.  I found it in the bargain books section priced at $4.99, so those of us without jobs might be able to actually afford it.

      Hi everybody.  Yes, last Friday was very much fun - thank you organizer ladies.  I'm curious as to what's up with this BBQ and planning - maybe someone could call me because it appears my UWO dial-up access has been cancelled.  Could they get us out any faster? Anyways, Justin and I will be at my house - 435-0984 if anyone would like to provide an update. Thanks!

      Hi all. On the request of several individuals, I have promised to post a blow-by-blow account of my adventure in Las Vegas - including groom's name, background, where the wedding takes place, whether Elvis marries me, etc.  Hopefully it will provide oodles of entertainment for everyone. ;)

      Thanks to everyone who organized Friday's festivities, and to all those who organized nights out and events throughout the year! You made it fun for us all  And now we're done.  I saw this poem and thought it was fitting for right now.   "The Road goes ever on and on     Down from the door where it began. Now far ahead the Road has gone,     And I must follow, if I can, Pursuing it with eager feet,     Until it joins some larger way Where many paths and errands meet.     And whither then? I cannot say." -J.R.R Tolkien  I remembered this poem the other day, and although I may get beaten up for posting it here, I don't care - since I think it summarizes how I feel - and how some others might feel as well.

      Thanks to Justin for the links. You've probably already guessed by now but the GF Gazette is not online.  However, we do have Internet. But no email. I had to develop my own Yahoo! email for people to use. But they don't really. They just stop by the office and drop it off. Because hey, it's Grand Forks. There's no voicemail. A nice lady named Betty takes messages. And though we use Quark for layout, the editor still uses those paper templates to figure it all out.  We had it good in Middlesex, that's for sure. Have a great time at grad. Can't wait to hear how it went.

      I was wondering - could we have the get-together the night before grad? A number of us (me!) will be in town then, but will have to leave right after the FIMS ceremony. I'd love to spend some relaxed social time with you all. Something to keep in mind.  Also, check out your young alumni magazine that came with the convocation package. There are some really good job interview tips in there that really helped me with the one I had yesterday.

      Wow, don't post a TD link.  I don't want people to know I work here.  But if you need accident in case your arms and legs get cut off, I can help you out with that.  People love to talk about it too, I promise.  One day I will have a news organization on the list!  I am staying optimistic!  I'm just wondering who is going to be able to make their way to London (come on, I know you miss it) for grad.  It'll be great to see everyone, and we should definately make plans to go out after we all get our awards at the luncheon.  Heh.

      Thanks to Justin for the links - that is awesome!  Soon there will be 20 or 30 different organizations/companies on there and we can start taking over the journalism profession. Working is actually work, so I have found.  I miss my days of waking up specifically to watch Dawson's Creek re-runs on TBS.  I miss it a lot. Working as the website reporter for Trot Magazine is fun.  I don't know nearly enough about horse racing yet but I spend my 3hrs a day on the TTC reading old magazines and stuff so I'll get there. The people who run the magazine (about two people) also take pictures all the time and if I write for the magazine I'll have to take pictures too.  So photography along with Quark are two MAJOR things our program missed. Otherwise I'd say we got a pretty good education.  Posting on the web for Trot is way easier than anything we did in Benedetti's class or what I did in UWO's Communications department for that matter. Anyway I hope everyone is doing well!  Do people still need tickets for graduation?  I may come but my parents definitely won't so I have two up for grabs to the first person who emails juliablythe@hotmail.com.  Cheers!

      I just added a new section to the blog on the right there.  If all the code worked right, it's a list of places that we're all working (if you click on links and get porn, I claim no responsibility - it's just a sign the universe wants our bodies).  I put them up solely to make those of us without jobs feel bad.  Or at least unproductive.  In a journalistic sense.  (That said, I'm sure I speak for more than myself when I say that I'm having a sweetass time waking up in the afternoon for a busy day of reading and seeing rock shows, so whatever.)  In any case, that list was done from memory and I don't know what else people are doing.  Sadly, I couldn't find a webpage for the Grand Forks Gazette, and I wasn't sure if a TD link would be appropriate, so ummm yeah.

      Hey Kids!  Turns out this job has me doing lots and lots of stuff.  I was supposed to be the Health and Education reporter, but it looks like I an now, health, education, city council, all other politics and a few other things.  It seems like we all do everything - this is a really, really small newsroom (four of us including our one ed), and I'm copy-editing and shooting photos, too.  It's been really cool so far.   How's everyone else liking the new jobs?

      Don't you love how most of the journalism jobs posted require photography skills?  Might have been good to have a course in that, huh?  I'm going to check if Fanshawe runs photography night courses.

      I am sitting at my desk at the Northern Life right now. I'm kind of having fun so far. I'm working on a story about the evacuation of some of INCO's employees in Indonesia (people from Sudbury sometimes work there). I'm also doing a little copyediting, which never fails to make me happy.   There is a guy working here who graduated from Laurentian with me last year. He went through Cambrian's journalism program and then got his degree at Laurentian. I had a class with him in 3rd year, so we already kind of know each other.  The people here play what is called "Russian Roulette" with the parking meters. The receptionist announces when the meter man is handing out parking tickets, and all the employees run outside to feed the meters. Except it didn't work in my case - I already have a ten dollar ticket!!  Hope everybody else is having similar fun in the world of journalism today. And good luck to the job hunters (not that I'm out of that category yet, exactly)!

      Hope everyone's long weekend was good. For those of us poor souls in SW Ontario it was a weekend of tornado warnings, severe thunderstorms, hail, constant rain downpours and humidity. Fun, fun. CBC News is reporting visitors to Grand Bend was down this year -- oh dear!  I played NHL 2003 on PS2 for so long yesterday my thumb feels bruised and numb. Is that normal? But it was the perfect day off nonetheless. So far in my make believe playoffs -- my Maple Leafs are in a heated series with the Islanders and Calgary is toasting San Jose again! Go Flames Go!  Next weekend is moving weekend.  Now back to work today, ugh. I'm doing some research and interviews for a local communications firm in London. Not exactly glorious, or what I imagined I'd be doing right now, but it's nice enough...and more importantly it pays. Daddy likes! :)

He is looking for a tutor who has taken the GMAT before and can tutor another student for the GMAT.  Is there anyone who's in London at the moment who's a) taken the GMAT and can tutor, b) interested in doing some tutoring?  Let me know!  Thanks,  Nathalie

      Okay, just checking if any of you knowledgeable journalism types know if this  urlLink US Draft news  is a hoax or not.  I saw it on  urlLink diepunyhumans.com .  I've checked a couple of seemingly official government websites that have records of these bills, so it doesn't seem immediately wrong, even though I can't find any mention on any of my major newsfeeds.  Update: Maybe I should have kept reading a bit more.  It's just old news that hasn't been mentioned (ever), despite being fairly important.  So those of you with jobs, push this story!   How will a possible American draft affect horse racing in this country?

And finally, what job exactly did you "sell out" on James?  I am very curious. And this time I apologize for any grammatical errors in advance, Caroline.  I now how they torment you. Hope everyone has a great long weekend. Joy

Maybe they were taken in by my eyes and smile. :)  Moreover, I too haven't recieved my graduation package, so apparently I haven't earned it either.

      Thanks for the good wishes Terri!  And don't worry, I think your decision to look for stuff mostly in Ontario will pay off very soon.  Moving great distances this often is not something I do as gracefully as Suzanne.  I wish I was that gutsy, but I'm being a big wimp about not being able to play with my friends again for at least another year.  Basically I am a huge suck - very excited but sad to leave all these great people yet again. And thanks again for the good stories of your brand of Western living James.  It's good to know they drink out there, too. As for me, I am now going to sit outside for the rest of the day. It is 24 and absolutely beautiful and I think I earned it after last week's brutal May blizzard. Joy p.s.  Did anyone recieve their graduation info?  I'd really like to get my degree mailed and important things like that.  Maybe they're just inviting the ones all the teachers loved out of spite.  In that case, have a great day James, you've earned it! :)

      It is Field, not Feild. Of course, my spelling has relaxed slightly and I proof nothing anymore. Like I always tell people just because I have an MA doesn't mean I got rid of ADD. Besides I don't think there are called Fielders, more like Drunk Ontarians Trying to Find Themselves in the Mountains of BC.  All I have to say, is that if you haven't seen the movie Love Actually, you need to do it soon! Talk to you kids later.  Hey before I forget...Julia, Mitch, Kasia, Trina...and Gareth too, I suppose. Did you get that e-mail from that student magazine in Toronto wanting us to repackage or pitch stories to the magazine based on our new media assignments on student debt. If you didn't get it let me know and I will forward the message to you all.

      Since Becky has good employment news, I'll add mine!  Today was my first day at the TD Call Centre in London!  Do you detect a note of sarcasm there?  Heh.  Seriously, I'm very happy for Becky and I find it happily amusing that the one we could have voted Least Likely to be a Journalist got a sweet journalism internship.  What would the administration say?  I'm also happy for me because I need money and TD is going to give me some.  And I've got a couple of things that might turn into something, but I don't want to talk about it too much lest I jinx it.  So I'm doing alright here -- I'm keeping on keeping on.  When I have some money I'm coming to Toronto to have some fun.  And when I feel a little down, I can always look at the picture of Mitch and Becky that Heidi sent out a few days ago.  Makes me giggle every time.  P.S. Good luck in B.C. Joy!

      Thanks for the advice J-Low.  Luckily I'm actually heading for a town of 10,000 (so there may be a few more people than Cariboo!), but I appreciate the advice.  And knowing that there is actually a town named Field.  So that locals would be "fielders?"  God I hope so, cause that's just great. Joy

Here's some advice: make a friend quickly, and more will follow, soon the whole town you know who you are and what brand of beer you drink. Find another hobby other than drinking and campfires (although those are fun times...just too much fun sometimes) and I'm sure you will meet a crazy pot/magic mushroom selling French Canadian at some point -- definitely make friends with him/her. :) But don't get to close...remember you need another hobby, but try hiking, mountain biking, or skinny dipping in a glacial lake.  And...put the cariboo in the lead.  And, Becky Guthrie you go girl! That anti-journalism facade is fading fast. I'm proud of you.

      Hello out there, While the snow is finally gone out here, so I for one am feeling a little better, particularly after reading how productive and successful you've all become.  Congrats to Becky, Heidi and Kyle for their different accomplishments over the past few days.  I think you all have more than earned each of your successful stories/ jobs.   And, Suzanne, seeing as you're out there in small town, B.C. yourself, any tips or lessons you've learned about that kind of living would be much appreciated. Good luck and good day to all! Joy

      I just got hired!  I've been telling a few people about the internship at Canadian Business magazine that I applied to, interviewed 2x for, and finally visited on Friday. Didn't know when I went whether I had the job or not - there's another candidate and both of us weren't sure whether there were going to be 2 positions or only one. But there's 2! So we both got it and the other intern seems really nice (and she's a girl, there will be no inter-office flirting!)  So I might be making less than Suzanne, in Toronot no less!, but I'm going to have one hell of an experience.  Which brings me to my next point - anyone know of cheap places to rent in Toronto that aren't complete shit? I'm starting on the 25th so I've got a week to find a place. The magazine's office is the Rogers building on the corner of Mount Pleasant and Bloor.

      I just got offered three weeks of paid work at the Northern Life, the newspaper that I have been freelancing for since I was nineteen. Unfortunately, these three weeks run over graduation. Both grad and this work mean a lot to me! Hopefully I will be able to get two days off. Should I not go to graduation if she says she needs me the whole time?? What would you guys do?

      Wow... I can't believe so many people have been posting on here.  I'd have to say this blog is a success Well, I'm glad to hear everyone is doing ok - and that some are struggling with the dreaded job hunt much as myself. Data entry jobs are starting to look pretty good right now...  So, I'm unemployed but the good news is that the CBC bought my Amish radio doc - and paid me some much needed cash. The problem is that they didn't tell me exactly when its going to air - they distributed the program across Canada, so I dunno. If anyone hears it, can they let me know? I just want to know that it does go on air!  Other than that, hope everyone's summer is going alright!

      Hmmm! The Sudbury Star is looking for newspaper carriers - that's kind of related to journalism, isn't it? Like many of you, I've spent the past couple of weeks applying for jobs that exist and don't exist. Most of them are in places that I've never heard of like Manotick, Ontario and St. Albert, Alberta. With luck, I should be able to find a journalistic job before it is time for me to retire. Freedom 55!  Seriously though, I think I have a lead on a good job in this city. I'm not going to say where because I don't want you guys applying too! Although it would really make me happy to have at least one of you within visiting range. So maybe I might actually finally get an interview.  Blah, all of the sources of employment that I thought I was going to be able to count on have fallen through in the past few weeks. The CBC gave all their summer fill-in work to more experienced stringers (AFTER the program manager promised me six weeks) and even my crappy (but well paid) city job turned out to be a bust because I had to be returning to school.  As for the Winnipeg snow, I thought it was bad when it snowed here a week ago on Sunday. But apparently the weather gods have decided to extend winter into mid-May in Manitoba.  Well, back to my boring life. I think I'm going to go to the public library tonight. Whoo hoo! And if anybody has the urge to wish me a happy birthday, I turn 24 on Sunday (and Alex turns 23 on Monday)! But I'm not holding my breath. Talk to you all later!

      Well it has been SNOWING the past two days in Winnipeg.  Mixed in with hail and sleet, it's not exactly what I like to call May.  They're shooting a movie here, and with a high of 24 one day, they made fake stuff.  In a normal city you'd think they'd have to do the same the next day. But not so much when it drops to -10 and dumps about 15 cm of crap from the sky. Can't say I missed this too much. Hope everyone is doing well (and is much warmer than we are out here!)

      Has anybody else ever gone to an interview only to find out you're not interviewing for the job you thought you were? And then felt like an idiot? But still got offered the job because the place has no standards? And then had to decide if you want to work at such a place?  After three weeks of being unemployed and living in my parents' basement, I'm seriously regretting turning down that non-journalism-related job in March.

      My first post on this blog... I'm back in Munster after a two week stint in Waterloo. I'm going a little stir crazy, but suprisingly the weather in Otts isn't all that bad - sunny and in the twentys! I've been running and trying to write a speech for my best friends wedding - which is harder than I thought it would be. Anyway, I've been job hunting like crazy and trying out new recipes (exciting I know). So if anyone is heading to the nation's capital feel free to give me a ring (613-838-3422). And this seems to be the trend, but I've been comtemplating a move to Taiwan come fall (after Collin finishes school). I also got to see my niece. Sooooooooooo cute. She's unbelievably beautiful and tiny (and loud. I think the smaller the lungs the louder the cries!)  Later skaters Kelly

      Hello people, Glad to see everyone is having fun out there.  Thanks especially to J-Low for the baby update.  Have you guys thought of a middle name for Ellie yet?   As for me I am just enjoying my last few weeks in the Peg, visiting with all my friends (who oddly enough all seem to be buying their first homes/ getting married/ both at once) and feeling older every time one of them does so.   I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to settle into my own 70s-decorated abode, but then again peeling off mounds of purple shag carpet out of your bathroom probably isn't all its cracked up to be.   Yay for apartments!

      Hi all,  It's Saturday morning here in London and surprise of surprises it's raining again! I'm sitting here unshaven and unshowered playing Family Fued online -- with Sarah Harmer playing on the stereo. I can't say that anything as exciting as what Suzanne is experiencing in Alberta is going on here. And, I am still not sure whether I want to jump on the Flames bandwagon -- my heart is still broken over my team. I was so mad I wanted to kick Pat Quinn in the head! I've calmed down though. Martha Stewart could do a better job coaching Toronto. Go Martha!  I was at school yesterday, where Angie and I got to meet the new class. They looked starry-eyed and unaware of what is ahead of them. It's nice to see innocence again. There's more boys in this years class -- wrong year Becky -- should've waited.  Erika is getting bigger and I must say more beautiful. You can see little Ellie rolling around in Erika's tummy. It looks cool and feels neat, although Erika will promptly tell me, "if it's so neat you try a foot under the ribs and see how long you feel that way!" We are moving into a new house on June 1st, just down the street from where we are now. It's a nice little cottage type house -- still in Old South! Is there any other part of London? If there is, I haven't seen it yet.  I just wanted to say thanks as well to everyone and to those who chipped in for gift for Ellie. We haven't gotten anything yet, but I can ensure we will get something great. To everyone still in London -- I think there's only a handful of us now, we should get together at some point.  And, if you know of anyone looking for a one-bedroom apartment on June 1st in the heart of the most beautiful part of London, let me know.  And, what's everyone up to...blog away!  Play safe and have fun, J.Low

      Hi all, I'll write this blog on behalf of Michelle and me b/c she's too drunk to write (kidding). Yup, we're in Edmonton and we've spent the last few hours drinking with soldiers, troops, men in green. Haven't had to buy a pint since we arrived. Being a girl has some benefits in these circles. Good times. The military journalism course has been a blast despite the HUGE binders of information they gave us when we checked in. Highlights (so far):  1: Vets talking about how they sent their "old hags to see the old bags" at the Vet hospital in Calgary. 2. Being on 17th Ave when the Flames beat the Red Wings. 3. Climbing around tanks and handling guns at the base in Edmonton today.  4. Being told that pictures aren't allowed around the sniper detachment.  Speaking personally, I'm so frickin' happy to be back in the West, I can't even express it properly. Loved biking in the Rockies last weekend. Even loved watching my friend get 9 stitches in the Banff hospital after a bike crash.  Don't worry; she loved it too b/c she got to watch the last minutes of Game 5 against the Wings in the waiting room.  Can't WAIT to move to BC next week. That's it for now. Off to Whyte Ave to party. GO FLAMES GO!!! p.s. Caroline - email me about your plans for Asia. I'll see if I knows peeples in places.

I've even got a source for you.  Also, my email is now hungry_j *at* mts.net, I have new glasses, and if you get the chance, you should see The Saddest Music in the World.  That is all.

      If anyone is in the Toronto area and needs a ride around downtown around 4:30am-5:00am....let ME know!  Instead of gallavanting (great word Caroline) around the world as initially anticipated you'll find me being slave to the people at City TV.  And, if waking up that early for a ride around Toronto doesn't entice you, let me know if you want to drop by Much Music, City Line or Breakfast Television.  I am there all day starting in the wee hours of the morning.  Best of luck to all  :)  The M...the U....the C....the H....the V...the I...the B...the E....the Much Vibe...WORD UP!

      Election - check.    I was thinking: there should be some sort of "belt" system for journalists....similar to karate (and other activities).  For example, an election belt, a weirdo guy afraid of the rain belt, a crazed politician belt, and a creepy comic man belt.  Once we've done it once and gotten that belt, it should mean we've graduated to the next level and can now opt in or out of participating.  Just a thought....    Well, I covered my first election...WOWZERS (to borrow from inspector gadget).  There was no love for the new kid at City TV.  I started Monday morning at 4:30am and worked until 9:00am on Tuesday. I had 2 hours sleep from 2:45-4:45am on Tuesday morning, but I was on one of those plastic cots with the matching plastic pillows that I thought went out of existence after nursery school.  Gotta love first aid rooms in media buildings.    They called it my christening.  I covered Jack Layton's event at the Metro Toronto Convention centre.  Who knew the NDP's would be such party animals. I felt like I was at my highschool prom - complete with a live band, a DJ and that dry ice stuff.  Tables were set up on either side of the stage.  I was waiting for he and Olivia Chow to show up in a tux and gown.  I totally could've used a course about media and politics in our program to help prep for the event...oh wait I took that didn't I?     ;)  Jokes.  I'm actually amazed at how much I really did learn.  Barf.  That was slightly sappy.

      Yikes! I haven't been on here for a while and the posts are just adding up.  I'm glad no one thinks I broke journalistic ethics - especially since I'm going back to the comic book stores this Saturday for FREE COMIC BOOK DAY!  As for titles, Justin, I got Seaguy and Hard Time. Seaguy was ok, but didn't really get my attention. Hard Time was definitely cool. And then one of the guys at work lent me like 8 or 9 different XMen and Batman comics so I'm hooked now! Hence free comic book day attendence. :)  Other stuff going on - I joined a recreational Ultimate team in the city! Had our first game yesterday - we won by default 'cause the other guys didn't have enough girls. But we played anyway and I dove into the dirt to catch the disc a couple times. Very fun. Thanks Suz for introducing it to me.  So a question for locals - what's everyone doing for the long weekend? I've got thurs-sun and only plans to go out Sat. night. Anybody up for a little action? Let me know!

      For the record, I did not almost pee my pants on the drop zone ride.  I was much closer to crying, actually.     Had it not been for Lee gently refusing to let me off the ride and slowly lowering the chest restraint, I would have run screaming from my seat safely planted on the ground.   However, as Mitch pointed out - and with NO help from him I might add - I did manage to swallow my fears and drop 200 stories from the sky.   Just wanted to get the story straight.

      Suzanne and Joy, you aren't alone in dealing with really annoying journalistic situations. A few weeks ago, Hapless Heidi was working as a reporter at the local paper. I was assigned a  urlLink story  about this guy who was concerned about speeding and accidents on the steep downtown hill where he rents an apartment. I did the initial interview with the guy, who seemed really sulky, and then started calling the police and the city to get comments from them. Strangely enough, the cops and the city said that they'd never had a complaint about the hill before! My editor, however, insisted that there was still a story.  The real problem started when the photographer and I tried to set up a photo of this guy. I phoned him and arranged for Marg (the photog) to meet him, and he said "but it's raining!" When Marg got back from meeting him, she said he refused to go outside because it was raining.   Not being a person to give up easily, Marg went back the next day, and buddy finally decided to budge from his apartment. Except this time he was upset with me because I didn't interview him in person and because he thought that I was going to report that he is a welfare recipient! He had never actually mentioned this to me. Marg told him to phone me.  Well, the call was interesting! The guy informed me that phone interviews are "against the law." I asked him what on earth he was talking about, and he said that police aren't allowed to take statements over the phone, and the same rules should apply here! "This is journalism, not crime!" I said, trying to suppress my giggles. At this point that I caught Craig's (another young reporter) eye, and rolled my own. After fifteen minutes of talking, I finally got fed up and said, "I'll get my editor to phone you." The editor did so, and told him that he was getting his fifteen minutes of fame, and to stop harrassing his staff!  Looking forward to similar such fun situations when I start at the CBC tomorrow.      urlLink

      Hello Everybody: A few of the j-skool crew went out to Canada's Wonderland on Saturday and had a great time. Julia almost wet her pants on the drop zone ride (or whatever the hell it's called), but she swallowed her fears and did it anyway. Things here at the old Post are... interesting. Please forgive our paper for the rediculous endorsement of Stephen Harper. For the record, at least half of the reporters in the FP are voting NDP, some Liberal and even a few Greens.  I don't actually know anyone here who is voting Tory. So hate the game all you want, but don't hate the players. But in case you want to join me at the Post, there are two openings at the NP Business mag, which is now part of the FP.  You can't beat the hours, we go for coffee at least twice a day, take an hour (min.) for lunch, watch Euro Cup and bitch about whatever we feel like! If you're interested, email me at mmoxley@nationalpost.com and I'll send along the info.  Mitch

      Junior Reporter Tranquilized and Restrained  (A Cautionary Tale) By Gazette Staff Suzanne White was shot with a tranquilizer gun, tied down and had her computer and phone privileges revoked last week before she could ruin any more budding political careers. In her column last week, White commented on the candidates' debate in her politically significant riding of Southern Interior. One candidate took exception to her assessment that he didn't perform well at the forum. After a lengthy 15 minute phone call, in which the candidate accused White of "putting the nail in his coffin", White promptly told the entire newspaper staff to warn her if the candidate stopped by the office. (Editor's note: The candidate in question is an Independent, running in a riding that has voted PC/Alliance/Conservative for the past 10 years and shows no signs of changing. He doesn't have a chance of winning the seat.) The candidate stopped by the office and spoke to the publisher about the irresponsible journalism that effectively ended his political aspirations. During this conversation, White hid in her office and searched for jobs on the Internet. Staff tranquilized the reporter as she updated her resume. "We don't usually sedate the reporters," said the publisher, "but we can't afford to lose advertising over editorial content." The Independent candidate is currently waiting to see if anyone voted for him. White's column has been pulled until she writes about something benign and meaningless. White is contemplating a career shift.

      Well, since it's been asked, you can decide on your own based on my experience.  I can say that within 3 hours of starting at j-school last week I was seated pretty tight with a not bad looking girl and we were holding hands whispering sweet nothings in each other's ears.  Then we did some walking hand in hand...  and right after that Cliff came along and found us. Let's just say he looked rather shocked.  But after he got over his surprise, he commended me for my initiative.

      Crazy days in the MA Journalism program at UWO.   Today in the midst of the little ones editing their boating/logging/immigration pieces -- the Avid decides to take a break and some scientists upstairs in the biology department decided to take a mental holiday.  So the day starts out with Cliff having to help out a student who missed the first week of class. He trying to teach someone to edit, use a DV cam, and write a script -- oh, and shoot a campus story -- all in one day. That's alright because Dave and I were Avid editing machines -- if I do say so myself.  But sometime around 1:30pm water starts spewing out of the ceiling in the TV studio. It was like someone turned on a tap in the ceiling. It ran down the wall with all the electrical outlets. Fortunately, no sparks or fires. But then it started coming out of the ceiling in the new control room and all over a brand new digital sound board.  As it turns out, the dimwits in the biology department were filling a tank full of water, left it unattended and the hose fell out flooding the room above the studio.   Dave was cool as a cucumber. He never wavered or lost his temper. At one point, I swear Wendie almost cried because she felt so bad for Dave, who I am sure has put in hours of his own time to get that new studio up and running.  I'm sure some of you want to know -- although there are many of you who don't give a rat's ass -- what the new kids are like, well, I think they are just like us, but only a wider variety of personalities. There's a wide range in age though -- many more "mature" students. The young-ones are very young and the oldies are definitely goodies. Trina and Jimmy Mac could weigh in with thier own opinions.  In other news, no baby yet.   Just one big mama with a squished bladder. Enough said. Although we went to a birthing class -- and never again. It was a little too "yuppie" for me, and full of people who watched to much Dr. Phil and read too many baby books. Not that I'm taking this impending parenthood thing lightly, but when you start quoting "What to Expect When Your Expecting" you know it's time for some serious self-evaluation.  That's all I have for now.  In the meantime, keep eating free food and scooping free gifts. I think both would pass the Potter's Box test. If they don't who really cares!  Cheers! And go vote!  ps - Terri give me a shout and well go for coffee -- and that goes for all the other kids still in town.

      Dude, I second the comics as research sentiment.  And giving comics away is a  urlLink grand & important tradition , so not accepting them would be consciously spitting in the face of the culture that you're trying to report on.  Now I want to know what titles the guy gave you.  Lucky punk.

      just for the sake of clarity, my free eating usually happens at the office or community events where everyone eats free.  i actually have turned done the free  meals when other people are expected to pay for them.  i think that's the main difference in the food debate.

      I eat free constantly at this place, which is great because I can barely afford food on my poverty line (or maybe below) salary.  So really as long as they absolutely know you aren't crossing the line, just participating in some buffet style fun, I say go for it.  And you needed to know the comis to write about them right?   I think it's all good.  Long as you except no cars, small homes or salmon fishing retreats.

      Becky - definitely didn't break journalism ethics!   Here is why - journalists are not like movie stars... we make crap money... so accepting a free gift can only enhance your knowledge of the story AND act as a suplement to the crap money.  I got to go to the post position draw for a really important horse race and there was free food and drinks there.  Did I deserve it? YES.  Did I feel guilty for getting free stuff "on the job"? HELL NO :)  Cheers to all from the world of harness horse racing. p.s. Lauren rocks.

      I'm apparently not hip - I have no idea what you people are talking about. GMail?  Anyway, I have a journalistic conundrum for you all. I think I broke journalistic ethics yesterday. :)  I'm doing this story about the competition between comic book stores and chain bookstores and how that may have changed with Japanese manga becoming so popular (that's right, I found another comic story to do!). I did a couple interviews at the stores, to get colour etc., and while I was at the Silver Snail, the owner asked me what comics I read. I truthfully told him none at the present because I don't know how to jump into a storyline that's been going on for the last 40-odd years. So he turns to one of his sales staff and tells her to hook me up with a couple issues!!!  So, in the end I get 2 comics for free. They weren't the big names (X-Men, Spider-Man, Batman, etc.) but still. Was I sleazy for accepting them? (and dashing out of that store before they could change their minds!)

      I doubt anyone's interested, but shortly after I got a GMail invitation, my Yahoo! Mail account magically improved itself. I now have 100 MB of storage, and I am using only 3% of my space instead of 57%. Did they do this because of the new competition from Google? Terri and Caroline, I should have offered you my GMail invite. I don't think I plan on using it. If anyone else wants it, tell me how I can give it to you, and I will.

      Supposedly those context sensitive ads (after all this Gmail talk mine are showing things for blog hosting) are driven solely by text analysis programs that no human actually looks at.  The same thing is in with that Gmail dealy, so theoretically no one is reading your email to send you spam, it's just the computers doing things that don't violate your privacy.     urlLink Believe that if you will .    There are a couple of watchdogs out there keeping an eye out for when the Google people go all Evil Empire, and some say it hasn't happened yet (although it's hard to tell who's on the payroll).

      Hey guys -- check out the links on the blogger banner at the top of your screen.  Mine are all to the CBC...Are yours all the same? Ya think a marketing machine is scanning this page and offering up pages of interest???  Next question: Why all the hyperinterest around Gmail? Is the only attration having a mazillion gragtrillion gigs (?) of space?  I'm not too excited about Gmail's plan to scan incoming and outgoing emails so they can spam me with products I might be interested it....  That's all. No cool celeb stories from the Dow...

      For those looking for a Gmail account, you can get one from Blogger.  When you first log-in, before selecting which blog you want to view, on the ride-side panel there is an offer to sign-up for a free Gmail account.  I got's me one too now!

      I don't know much about that gmail and luckily I haven't had to deal with uptight CBC newscaters...but, I did have something kind of fun happen at work last week. I was working late and got the chance to meet Ashlee Simpson, Jessica Simpson's sister!  Her whole entourage, including MTV, were there!  It's interesting to watch these "nouveau celebs" and how they interact with people who can make and break 'em, but the cool part is I'll get to  be on MTV! :)  Who said work can't be fun!  I guess getting up at 3:30am does have some perks! On another note, I saw the movie/documentary "Control Room," all about Al Jazeera and the war in Iraq.  It was pretty good and it was even better watching it in a theater with Americans.  The footage and people interviewed were similar to some films we saw in class, but it was interesting to see it outside of school...to be able to evaluate it and discuss it with "non-journalists".

      I have not been able to post lately - so I'm just wishing and hoping this will work.  Belated congratulations to all those who won awards and thanks for those who said the same to me.  I've thanked and applauded everyone three times now, but those messages appear to be lost somewhere in cyberspace. And I've gotta say - Samira, you're fucking funny!  And I know what you mean when you talk about people with attitudes.  In my case, it's some of the people I interview, not the ones I work with.  Half my interviews are wonderful, friendly people who tell me everything I want to know and then thank me for my time. The other half are rude and insulting and show up late, or not at all.  Then they demand to read my copy before it goes to print and fight with me for ten minutes about whether I have a right to say no.  Apparently former employees weren't so strict as little-miss-just-finished-journalism-school.  So basically, the most annoying part of my job is telling people they can't dcitate what I write.  Which they're still getting used to. Here's hoping the nice people are contagious!

      Is there anyone in the class who has been invited to test GMail and isn't interested? I signed up for a GMail account and then told Brian about it and now he has been blogging like a maniac trying to "earn" an invitation. It's kind of sad...he wants GMail SO bad. If anyone in the class would be willing to give up their GMail invitation that would be great...you would make a young man very happy.(It's better than WorldVision!) :-) Please just let me know. Thanks.

      My commitment to this class: Feel free to shoot me if my head ever swells so large that I spew drivel instead of the news.  I kid you not.  I just got an angry call from a reporter who said, “Don’t tell me what the news is, I know what the fucking news is!”  Clearly, he doesn’t.  For someone who “has been in the business for 22 years,” he editorializes as much as George Bush is convinced there IS a connection between Iraq and Al-Qaida.  Cliff would fail him so fast that Romayne wouldn’t even have time to mount a case against him. (Sigh)  Alas, I am just an intern, who am I to judge.  Who am I to judge?  I Samira *F-ing* Hussain, that’s who!  And no Ms. Tait, that does not fall under the swollen head category.   I am leaving this building to escape to Niagara-on-the-Lake with my Bubba.  Alcoholism here I come!

      Not to dissuade any aspiring radio stars, but none of us have enough experience for reporter/editor jobs at CBC Radio. The program manager told me that straight out after I initially applied for it in April. She said to look for "researcher" jobs instead. She says it is a good idea to apply though to get our names into the system. That being said, my casual fill-in job description is reporter/editor, and even associate producer for one week! And I'd love to have any one of you in Sudbury for awhile.  If anybody is looking for a newspaper job in London, there is a full-time, eight-month contract, $11/hour job opening at  urlLink Fanshawe's student union newspaper .

      I'm not looking for a full-time radio gig, but I know some of you are, so I thought I'd let everyone know that CBC Radio in  urlLink Sudbury  is hiring a reporter.  It's been reposted -- it was posted at the end of April.  It might be a good chance at a radio job in Ontario for those of you looking for that.  If I get any more job info from Benedetti, I'll be sure to pass it along!

      Sorry, no listings yet.  On Saturday it was the almost final cut.  Marshall (the director) was going to slightly extend one sequence at the end and had to do the final audio mix.  I don't know if it will just be available on DVD or will make it to theatres or television or whatever.  But keep your eyes open.  And way to go, Heidi.  (On the CBC thing.

      Yeah, some listings would be great.  It does sound really interesting, and it would be nice to get a view of the war from the inside, as it were.  Thanks for posting about it, Justin.  Of course, I'm sure it will never come to London because this city has no culture.  Speaking of documentaries (nerd alert!), Dan and I went to see  urlLink Super Size Me  on Saturday night after seeing the director, Morgan Spurlock, on The Daily Show last week.  I really enjoyed it -- it's got a Michael Moore style, but it's a lot more...measured.  All of the hype focused on how he ate at McDonald's for a month, but that's a framework for the things he discusses -- advertising, school lunches, stomach reduction surgery and obese children.  You all know how I hate fat kids.  Anyway, I'd recommend it.  On top of being informative, it's also quite entertaining.

      I JUST GOT HIRED BY THE CBC!!!!!!! Not full time or permanently or anything, but I have what amounts to a summer job with CBC Radio Sudbury, where I did my internship. I have about six weeks of work out of eight, starting at the end of this month. Wow, am I ever happy. They pay well too, in comparison with the jobs I've been interviewed for. I can laze around at camp on weekends this summer and have some weekdays off too!  Barry Mercer, one of the journalists there, told me that once people get their foot in the door at the CBC, they very rarely go away! So, I am thrilled!

      Hi everyone, It was good to see all those who made it out to convocation last week - I only wish that our entire group was there - and I hope you all made it back safely to your respective homes. I was a bit worried on the morning of grad that I wasn't going to be able to participate in the ceremonies because I didn't get to the gym to pick up my gown until about fifteen minutes past the deadline (not very journalistic, I know), but when I finally did arrive, I was happy to see that about half the class had just shown-up, and a few more straggled in even later. By the time I'd picked up my hood, the procession to Alumni Hall had already started and Mitch, Samira and I had to run all the way there, coffees in hand, to catch up to the rest of the class and find our spots. Classic j-school. I'm off to Africa soon - Ghana to be exact - where I'll be working as a radio reporter for Journalists for Human Rights. It's a six month posting and I'm super stoked about it! Alexandra is also going with the same same organization, although she's doing TV broadcasting and will be in the capital, Accra, while I'll be about four hundred kilometers north, in Tamale. It should be very interesting, as general elections are taking place in December and the political situation (at least in the North,) can be fairly volatile. I'm hoping there will be plenty of opportunites to freelance too.  Anyway, I have to run - I'll post more later. John.

      Yesterday I went to the first public screening of  urlLink Battleground , which is ( urlLink GNN  co-founder) Stephen Marshall's documentary about Iraq.  He was in country for 21 days, shot 50 some-odd hours of footage, and has made a really personal piece of work that deals with depleted uranium, suicide bombings and crop destruction.  It's not Michael Moore style rhetoric, but Iraqis and American soldiers in Iraq talking about what this occupation really means.  There's a tank commander talking in front of a Britney Spears poster who talks so eloquently about what they're doing there and why he thinks it's right, it just makes you cry.  If anyone gets a chance to see this film, do so.  At least  urlLink watch the trailer .

And Carly and Terri were amusing drunks as usual! It was worth the 7 1/2 hour drive to see my j-skool friends again, although it has left me missing you more!   Congratulations to all the award winners of yesterday, especially Teviah for winning the Ursula Walford award. And for all of us who never win awards (and for those who do), I was listening to this song last night while watching the road-hogging tractors and dusty farm fields of Southern Ontario turn into the idiot drivers and pine trees of 400 N/Hwy.69:  Who I Am  Jessica Andrews   If I live to be a hundred  And never see the seven wonders  That'll be alright   If I don't make it to the big leagues  If I never win a Grammy  I'm gonna be just fine  'Cause I know exactly who I am   I am Rosemary's granddaughter  The spitting image of my father  And when the day is done  My momma's still my biggest fan   Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy  But I've got friends who love me  And they know just where I stand   It's all a part of me  And that's who I am   So when I make a big mistake  When I fall flat on my face  I know I'll be alright   Should my tender heart be broken  I will cry those teardrops knowin'  I will be just fine  'Cause nothin' changes who I am   I'm a saint and I'm a sinner  I'm a loser, I'm a winner  I am steady and unstable  I am young but I'm able   I am Rosemary's granddaughter  The spitting image of my father  And when the day is done  My momma's still my biggest fan  Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy  But I've got friends who love me  And they know just where I stand  It's all a part of me  And that's who I am

      Yes, more tales of rowdiness are in order.  And, (I'm sorry for being the kind of person who asks this but) I'd love it if someone who was at the awards thingy (I'm looking in the direction of an expectant father, but anyone will do) could post who got which award.  I'm just curious.  I wasn't there and I'd like to know.  I know that they didn't shut us all out, no matter how deep some of that dislike may have been.

       So, I need details from the party last night! I got a terrific (and very drunk) call from Terri, so obviously some fun was had! :)  I'm sure by now everyone who had to move home is going squirely now and the party helped relieve some of that tension. Just another reason that we should all get together again! I love my apartment and I love my space, and I love that I don't have to answer my parents' calls, but I miss hanging out with the gang.  Anyone who is interested in getting together (and can make it to Southern Ontario) should email me so I can start some sort of planning. :)  You can get me at guthriebecky@hotmail.com

      Just out of curiosity...who's the "certain" group?!  Hopefully most of the people who won awards are there so the presenters will have someone to present to :)

      Hello all,  I just got off the phone with Cindy Morrison at FIMS, she called to ask me if I had heard whether a "certain" group of people were coming to the after convocation luncheon. This is because there are several award winners who haven't RSVP'd and now they have people lined up to present the award -- with the possibility of no-shows.  Don't worry all you out of towners slaving away in newsrooms in BC for next to no pay and for long, long hours -- I let Cindy know where to send the money (or that you aren't coming), if you win, of course.  If you're in London and going to the luncheon and haven't RSVP'd call 661-2111 ext 88484.

      As if indeed.  My aunt and uncle in Calgary wanted to see me before I flee the country so I drove out there with my mom on Friday (13 hours).  I was convinced I would be on the Red Mile for the biggest party Calgary's ever seen.  I just got back to Winnipeg, a sadly angry man.

      Goddammit.  So the TV is going to be on the CBC at your place at, say, 8 p.m. on Monday night, right Clarisse?  As if Game 7 is on Monday.

      Yeah, so I'm in the office by myself and I'm wondering if anyone else has to work lots of unpaid hours at their new small town media outlet of choice?  It appears that we each have to work at least every third weekend, and when we do so here, we don't get any days off in the week to make up for it.  We also each work at least nine hours a day, and I get the pleasure of working 14 hour days every Monday (covering city council meetings after all the other stuff).  Not that I don't like writing 6 articles a day, and editing many more on production days, but it would be nice to get paid for it all. We're still short at least one person, so I'm hoping it all equals out later on, but I'm starting to wonder.  So if anyone can answer my little informal work hours poll, I'd appreciate it. The people are awesome,  I'd just like to figure out what to expect.

      Heidi, the Gzowski internships aren't open to Western students...so we never actually qualified. I don't know if that makes it better or not?!   I hope you all have a fantastic time at Grad. Carly, I expect a little more than "a" drink for each of us! How 'bout two or three? :-)

      Hi! I just found something on the CBC website that annoys me. Apparently there is a CBC Radio equivalent of the Donaldson - the  urlLink CBC Radio Peter Gzowski Internships . Um, why the big hype about the Donaldson and nothing about this? Maybe the profs didn't know, but it is annoying to find out now that we don't qualify to apply anymore. Eerrgh!

      Let's say 8:30ish on Monday at our place, 460 St. George. If anyone can't make it here, then we'll see you downtown at Barney's hopefully, weather permitting (once again, if the weather sucks or there's a huge line, we'll go to the Martini Bar..)  And we'll have a drink for everyone who can't be here!

      So here's the plan for Monday:  Everyone will meet at Clarisse's place earlier in the evening (exact time to be determined, but of course we will all show up AT LEAST a half an hour late).  Then we will all head downtown, to either Barney's (if the weather is nice) or the Mongolian Grill martini bar (if it's not).  Or maybe both!  Is there ever anything wrong with cheap martinis?  Hope to see lots of you then!

      I'm starting to think graduation ceremonies are highly overrated. So my plan right now is to go out Monday night (if people are still planning on it??), skip the long and painful grad ceremony the next day, then go to the awards luncheon thing (when have I ever been known to turn down free food??!).   As for debauchery... my birthday is the following weekend (the Saturday - 12th) and I think I'll be in Toronto. I was hoping whoever is around might be tempted to come out for some Sushi on Bloor and maybe go out for drinks afterwards with me and Collin.

      Wow, those poor, poor new kids.  I felt busy enough in the summer - infact, I think the slower starting pace made the whole thing more managable in the end.  But then again, I'm the perfectionist who always manages to fill her time. Congrats to Kasia for getting a job in the big city!  That's probably quite a bit more exciting than Quesnel.  But now we're having a news meeting, so I gotta go. Have a good one and congrats to all you grads.   Joy

      I kind of agree about the summer term. When I entered the program on a bright sunny day last May, I thought that I was going to be producing lots of articles that I could freelance and put in my portfolio. I only got two from the summer term.  Seriously, during the summer, there were days when we didn't have classes or long weekends when all I had to do with myself was sit at home and watch What Not to Wear on TLC with the cats.  So I needed stuff to do and I would have appreciated having it!! TV and Radio were a little better for that - but the only time I was ever stressed out from school during the first term was that day when we were all fighting in TV. Remember that?  Anyway, my mom just phoned me (as I write) to tell me I got another interview, so I better post this!

      Aggression is right... I emailed the class about textbooks and got three people asking me about the program. I told them what happened (well, roughly) and then they told me they had Romayne as a print instructor... and she had already scared them badly.  As for word about the beach, I was part of the group that provided feedback and while I didn't say that, I do agree with it. Lets face it guys - the summer term WAS easy. I think the only stressful time was when Spencer's paper was due... before he gave us the unlimited extension. And I would have liked it better had there been more assignments. Now that I'm out looking for a job, I wish I'd had more opportunities to write/produce since its something I could use as an example for a job!  But anyways... I will be at grad, tho' I don't know why (considering its cheaper to get the diploma sent to you). Plus... I was reading the ticket that's sent out... we have to be there at 8:45 and grad starts at 10:00?!?!  %^(@#)$&^@)(*&^$#!!!  Oh well, it'll be good to see everybody there again... assuming that is that most people actually come!

      I'm going to grad because my wife and my Mommy are making me go. Yes, I have a daughter on the way and I am already officially whipped by women. Oh well, I had a good run. I hope to see more people there. I didn't RSVP about the awards ceremony bascially because I'm leary of dragging my family to another lengthy ceremony with no point.  I heard from on girl in the new class about how they had more assignments. They also have to submit them to a so-called "independent" third party for evaluation. But who cares! I think it's kind of funny that they're taking their aggression about us out on them. Heh heh.  Hope everything is good.

      Hey all,  Am up to London today for a job interview, and got some news from within.  Apparently somebody told the powers that be that the program was too easy and we went to the beach all the time in the summer... dunno where they got that from.  Supposedly they have more print assignments than we did... pretty well everyday.  And an extra prof.  But communicating and orientation still seem to be great concerns.  Supposedly only one person has had a C so far, but they got the big speech on the first day.  And Cliff has already scared half of them with an e-mail about tv.  There's one guy in the class on leave from Radio-Canada.  They really need people to RSVP ASAP (how's that for acronyms) about attending the FIMS luncheon on Tues.   The new studios are still a mess of cables everywhere, but they hope to get things together still in the next couple weeks.  They've got some fancy new equipment, but the building itself seems kind of crowded.  Dave is happy cause he's able to do station feeds again, and he's going on vacation next week.

      I think I need some debauchery in my life. :) I've been very good for the past 2 or 3 weeks. Haven't gone out dancing, haven't gotten drunk, haven't hit on anybody. :) I'm actually kinda boring!  When can we do this debauchery? Before the end of July I think. Otherwise we're planning too far ahead.  Who's up for it? and where should we go?

      debauchery did i spell that right?  See, I could spell check it here on blogger...which isn't something i could do at Dow Jones.  Lemme repeat that: i, the worst speller in the world, am being forced to work without spell check.  Its a nightmare. Can the union help me out with this? So, I finished my first story and popped my head up over my terminal and said: "Um, I can't seem to find the spell check.  Where is it?"  To which some nice editor on the edsk responded: "We don't have spell check."  (Insert my laughter here).  "No, really, where is it?" "No, really, we don't have it.  We did, but we got it disabled because it was causing too many problems."  WHAT? are you kidding me? Who disables spell check? I'm convinced I could single-handely get this compnay to reverse that stupdi, stupid, stupid policy.  In case you wondering, I've been cutting and pasting my story out of our program into word to spell check it.  For some reason, the words don't actually show up on screen, but when I spell check it, it finds the words i've attempted to spell and offers much better optiosn than I could ever come up with.  Tedious?  Oh, god.  But, its effective.  That's all... Carrie, wire slut

      I like debauchery.  So if we don't actually go to the grad ceremony and physically get handed our diplomas as we're rushed off the stage, we have to pay money to get it?  Can't we just go get the damn thing if we're in London?  I'm seriously considering skipping out on the ceremony at this point.  My parents can't come, and it seems kind of cruel to make Dan go just so I don't have to go alone.  I'm dreading the thought of sitting through all the undergrads getting an English degree just to have my 10 seconds of semi-glory.  I really don't want to spend $25 to rent a hot polyester robe for 3 hours when I could better spend that money on bills (or drinks!).  And I just don't give a shit, to be frank.  So I might just crash the awards ceremony and steal some mini sandwiches.  Heh.

      Hi all, I figure I haven't written enough on the blog recently so I'm adding my two-cents worth.  I'm not heading to convocation, mostly because I didn't feel comfortable taking the time off (without pay), but also 'cause I don't feel like the ceremony is worth my time. The only reason I would go (to the ceremony) would be to collect my blasted diploma for free instead of sending UWO another $14!!  But I would like to see as many of you guys as possible - who's left in Southern Ontario? Can we do a Southern Ontario j-school reunion?  Not that I mean to exclude everybody outside of Southern Ontario - I'd love to have you there as well, I just figure travel expenses outweigh a couple nights of foolery and debauchery.  And I'm horrible at calling people in Toronto :) (such as Carrie, who I know is in Toronto and I've been meaning to call but I'm just a lazy lazy girl). Who else is here?  Whaddya think?

      Hi all,  Erika and I are glad to tell you all that Eleanor Grace Low was born at 12:02 am Tuesday, July 27th at the London Health Sciences Centre weighing 9 lbs 9 oz. After almost 40 long hours of labour the doctors and nurses delivered&nbsp;Ellie by c-section. Despite all this both Erika and&nbsp;baby are doing great.  I have to say she is the most beautiful baby--I know, I know--new parents always say that. But she&nbsp;has&nbsp;big cheeks and dark hair like Erika and was alert and looking around after a long, long day. Needless to say, there were a few anxious moments, but our little family will all be at home by Friday.  I will post pictures soon, but I need some sleep and then I'm back to the hospital to stare at our beautiful little girl.

      Hi guys - I'm thinking of doing a story about what to do when you want to change your career (we're supposed to change careers something like 4 or 5 times in our lifetimes). Does anyone know someone who's been successful in different careers? I was thinking journalist to PR professional, but I don't think the difference is great enough there :) Otherwise I'd be beating Estok's door down.

      Hi everybody! I just want to wish James and Erica good luck for the big event. I hope you've been watching a lot of "A Baby Story" on TLC in preparation!  Things are going OK at the CBC, I suppose. I've been filling in for the associate producer since last Monday. One of my favourite things about this job is booking the morning syndication (main CBC) live interview. It's like playing the lottery! You put in your call, and wait anxiously for them to accept or reject your request. I've also almost accepted looking like a dipwad for a new and creative reason every single&nbsp;day. It's part of my existence right now.  I'm beginning to think that Wendie, Gary and Geoff pampered us. They were much easier on us than real producers ever&nbsp;are. Anyway, have a good rest of the week everyone.

      Hello,  No baby yet...and I'm sure you're all getting tired of these blog posts. Today is "d-day" but I think Ellie is quite content where she is. I think she's scared -- after all she's been listening to my nonsense for nine months nown in-utero. Erika is tired and feeling kind of yucky, which would suggest it will be anytime now. Other than that, she's doing well despite the spastic bladder. Ew. Hey, yours would be too, if you had a huge baby heading crushing your internal organs. Heeead move, now!   Take care, and have fun.  ps- Terri, i think Erika and I are considering getting us some of those Choose Carbs tees.

      FYI - According to Tod Maffin, CBC Radio is looking for freelancers, story ideas, etc. for a new morning show called Points West. It's a show for BC communities outside of the Lower Mainland (b/c honestly, we really don't care that the Ironworkers Bridge is backed up at 8am and there's a three sailing wait for all ferries). I know that most of you are in sweltering Ontario, where the trees stay green and don't turn into towering infernos at the flick of a Bic, but I'm sure many of you have great story ideas that can be adapted to BC interests. Check out the Tod Maffin site for details b/c honestly, I'm too lazy to check my facts right now. Suz the Stepford Reporter

I love Canadian Business.  Anything interesting going on for anybody else? C'mon, Caroline, Alex and John have to have something! They're living exciting adventurous lives. :)

      To look at this from a slightly different perspective... &nbsp; Why should insider trading be a crime at all? In order to be succesful in business and rise to the top (man or waman), you have to know people.&nbsp;You have to have access to some kind of information that avergae people do not. If I buy an abandoned lot after finding out my friend is planning on opening a Wal-Mart across the street, I am not breaking any laws. It's smart business. If my phone rings and someone on the other end has information that could save me millions? I would be a bad business person to ignore said information and watch my money go down the drain. Legalize insider trading!!

      I realize Carrie just suggested we stop talking about Martha... I just thought I'd throw in my two cents first.&nbsp; I do believe people should be punished for white collar crimes and I don't think Martha is innocent -- of course she knew what she was doing -- but why has so much time energy and publicity gone into prosecuting her? There are oodles of men out there committing white collar crimes but they haven't been pursued to the same extent Martha has.  &nbsp; This may sound slightly conspiracy theory, but I interviewed a womens studies prof in February who suggested that people wanted to bring Martha down because she has built an empire out of what has traditionally been women's work (which has been traditionally considered frivolous etc. by most men). Powerful women intimidate weak men. &nbsp; ok that's all.  &nbsp; I'm headed to a temp agency at the moment and I'm just at the library to print my resume off first. I'm still in Waterloo bunking with the b-friend. Library is kind of my second home :)

      my head is too big to fit in there. ;) &nbsp; I think the whole Martha thing makes fascinating news, but I just thing it does so for all the wrong reasons. I don't believe in Martha's moral code, nor do I buy her products -- okay maybe once -- I bought Erika new Martha bed sheets from Zellers -- neither do I like what she stands for. Sure she committed a crime, but she's gonna spend the same amount of time in jail as two people who caged little chlidren in Ontario. I know it's all apples and oranges -- but I think it's a very fair comment that Martha got jail time -- not because of her crime, but rather because of who she is, and what people "think" she stands for. &nbsp; Cheers. Still no baby yet.

      J.Low, I say this because we're friends, because I think fondly of you.... Get ye head out of ye arse. Martha committed a crime.&nbsp; Martha goes to jail.&nbsp; Done.&nbsp; Don't pity her - she knew the score. Before sniffing paint chips, she used to be a stock broker - she knew how to play the game.&nbsp; And now she's playing the pity card.&nbsp; No sympathy here.&nbsp; (Although, that said, I do have more love for Mr. Lay, but that's a whole diff aruguement).&nbsp; The aruguement that she made a lot of ppl happy by showing them how to&nbsp;match their&nbsp;bathroom handtowels to their dinner wine&nbsp;is crap: OJ's touchdown passes made millions happy, but that doesn't seem buy any love with you. It's true no one died for&nbsp;Martha's crime, but that doesn't mean we should turn a blind eye to white collar crime.&nbsp; (But many would argue they did lose $$ on her dealings). And who is Eleanor Flomenhaft?&nbsp; I don't care what she thinks, and neither should you.&nbsp;  &nbsp; That said, I still think you;ll be a good daddy -- and Ellie will have the best decorated pad in the leauge. &nbsp; Cheers, Carrie, who couldn't help but to stir the pot

      I just want to say a few things: first, I think Martha did get a raw deal. Any rational person would realize -- hey OJ Simpson and the Enron guy are still walking free, but some harmless woman who creates crazy crafts deserves jail time for a small-time insider trading charge. It's a double standard! &nbsp; Second, hate Martha because she has set housewives back a few hundred years, but to say she deserves to go to prison is ridiculous. Hey, even those people have to admit she does come up with some cool stuff even if she goes overboard. &nbsp; We in the western world love to tear down those we build up -- what is this world coming to? It's time to stop this vicious cycle and free Martha! If onl we could all have the same feeling as Eleanor Flomenhaft of New York: &nbsp; "Experts on federal sentencing expect Stewart to get 10 to 16 months in prison - although she may be allowed to remain free while she appeals her conviction. Since the celebrity homemaker was found guilty March 5 of lying about a 2001 stock sale, hundreds of fans have flooded the judge with letters begging for leniency.  "This woman is to homemakers what Einstein was to science and Freud was to psychiatry," wrote Eleanor Flomenhaft of Hewlett Harbor, N.Y." &nbsp; --- &nbsp; But like Nelson Mandela? -- that's stretching it. Perhaps even I think Martha deserves time after that comment -- just to teach her that there's a difference between freedom fighting and calling fresh herbs "good things". Alas, poor Martha is going to jail because of society's loathing of successful women. What kind of a world am I bringing my daughter into? It's okay to be successful Ellie, but just not more successful then a man because everyone will hate you for it. &nbsp; I said my two-cents. It's time to let go and embrace all successful women. Now that's a good thing.

      Well, Brian and I have been in Daegu for a week now and we are finally starting to learn our way around. On our first day at the school we were greeted by about 600 screaming Korean kids below the age of 12...it was almost too much for the senses. They had us start teaching on our second day and although we felt a little overwhelmed we're getting the hang of it now. We have had some awesome food (and some not so awesome food) and are starting to learn some basic Korean. It's hot and humid and very different from home...so far it's pretty cool though. We are planning on going to the DMZ sometime soon and against my better judgment I am bringing along my microphone. One of us has to be put in a foreign jail sooner or later...it's a right of passage isn't it?

      Akwaaba from Ghana!  Alex and I have been in Ghana for four days now and things have been... interesting.  First things first - the flight (the short version)- emergency landings, unplanned stop in Djibouti, another unplanned stop in Djibouti, and then the hi-jacking (sort of) of our flight to Accra.   We were supposed to leave Pearson on an Air Canada 737 at 10:30 Sunday night, but apparently, there was no crew to load the cargo so we couldn't take off for another hour and a half. And then it got better, for about an hour, until the captain announced that we would be making an emergency landing in Halifax because someone had apparently become violently ill immediately after taking off. We were in Halifax for quite some time while the paramedics took care of the poor, sick woman, who was eventually taken off the plane in a stretcher. The rest of the trip to Frankfurt was painless, although the movie selection was abysmal.   When we arrived in Frankfurt, we had to rush to the next plane, which had been waiting for us because there were a lot of people from our flight headed to Addis Ababa. The flight to Addis Ababa was great  - I lucked out and got a seat with plenty of extra leg room, and we all had our own TVs on which we could watch movies or a flight map so we knew exactly how long we were from our destination. The flight map was infitely more interesting than the movies - it was especially intersting when the target on Addis Ababa dissappeared and we flew past it and the 'kilometres to destination' numbers kept growing rather than shrinking. About twenty minutes later, the captin told us that Addis Ababa was fogged in and we would be landing in the Republic of Djibouti. We landed, and after an hour, we set of for Ethiopia again. Once again, I watched the flight map as we approached, and once again, we began to veer off course. Then the TVs all turned off. Twenty minutes later, the captain came over the intercom to say "I'm sorry, you're not going to believe this, but the weather got bad again, so we are on our way back to Djibouti, where we will wait it out." We stayed in Djibouti for several hours that time, and we weren't allowed to leave the plane because there were other planes that had been redirected and all in all there were too many people to fit into the terminal. Several hours later, we took-off agian and managed to land successfully in Addis Ababa - then it got bad.  There was a plane there for us to take. It was going to Accra, Ghana, via Douala in Cameroon. Just as we were going to board though, there was an announcement that the plane wasn't going to stop in Douala after all - it was going to tgo straight to Accra, so that the backlog created by the poor weather (fog) could be cleared up, and the people heading to Cameroon would be able to take a flight later on in the evening. The people going to Cameroon didn't like this. About twenty of them started yelling and screaming at the officials, saying that it was unfair, and the officials tried to calm them down, saying that they would give them free hotel rooms for the day, etc, and some of the Cameroonians were satisfied and left - but many did not. Instead, they decided to block the boarding gate, because if they couldn't fly, then nobody could. So about ten, very large Cameroonians stood in front of the gate, yelling and threatening everybody and gesticualting wildly when people tried to reason with them and I sat there - no sleep for days, waiting for the situation to be resolved, waitintg for order, for the cops (the guys were yelling "bring the police, we'll fight them!!!"), but alas, no order, no police - there were security guards, but they stood far away, behind protective glass and the talked and laughed and held hands... while we waited. Finally, after a couple of hours, the officials decided that they would let the guys - thugs - on the plane, and reroute it to Cameroon after Ghana. So we all got onto the plane, like one big happy family, and we got to Ghana. Finally.  More to come...

The photos the art department chose for the story were not the same type of canoes I wrote about!!! How's THAT for confusing!  But on Monday, everyone who cares to see my name in print can go to www.canadianbusiness.com and click on Perks (in the ugly left-hand side bar) and then on Current Issue, which you can barely see in grey font under the bright green banner.  And then you will see how low this journalist has stooped.....a 800-900 word story about CANOES.

      Well, I've been having the opposite problem to many of you. The CBC has very high journalistic standards, and I keep on getting lectures about not assuming stuff by the acting producer. Not that the things she brought up that I have assumed have been very serious or anything (I got something slightly wrong when I was talking to someone, and she heard)! She was upset yesterday because the people in Thunder Bay had changed the wording of a story and gave it a completely different meaning.  But I had a real scare on Tuesday that will make me think twice about being careless for a long time. I was on deadline, and I was trying to get some information out of a cop because the press release hadn't reached us. I somehow got the last name of a child that had drowned incorrect by one letter, and it changed the pronunciation. It went to air. I quietly told the newsreader the next morning that the name was incorrect and she changed it. I didn't get in trouble because the producer didn't hear. But I felt kind of awful.  I do know what you guys are talking about though. At the paper I worked at in May and June, the editor would often "add" information to my articles without asking me. It often made the article totally inaccurate, and ultimately, it might have come back to me, because it was my story. I was less than thrilled with him.  I keep trying to remember that I am learning about the world of journalism, and all of these experiences are good for me.

      Good thing we had an ethics class in J-skool right? I have a feeling that the paraphrase quote is very common (which is why people always complain about being misquoted) The town/village situation seems a bit extreme for them to press.... but for some reason, i'm not surprised. I think the Woolwich Observer would do that... They are sticklers for detail - some ways good, some ways bad. They never want to be accused of misquoting anyone, so they require ALL interviews to be recorded and dumped into a central audio system. Good idea - that is until you record a 15 min. interview and then find out your recorder ran out of batteries 2 mins in and you have to go re-do the interview (even if you have accurate quotes and info in your notebook - not that I've had to do this or anything :P).  A good example was my first day 'streeter' assignment - asking strangers inane questions is bad enough (ie. What summer blockbuster do you most want to see...), but I had to go out three times, because every time, there was a glitch with my recorder and they insisted I get them all on tape. I guess they are really worried that someone might complain that "I want to see Spiderman 2 because it looks really good," is a misquotation :P  I know why they are asking for recordings - just seems that for something fun and innocent like this, some leeway would be possible Oh, and coincidentally, I've discovered I need a new digital recorder...

      Yes, the newsletter/ newspaper line is not always so clear. Yes, I definitely want oodles of pictures when Ellie decides to be born. And yes I too, find many little things too appreciate about my work, besides the fact none of my quotes get "massaged." Just felt like responding to previous posts and agreeing with everything in them with what is probably poor spelling and bad grammar, since I'm too lazy to check it.  Turns out I am going to a barn dance Saturday, which supposedly is the Quesnel event of the year.  If I drink enough, maybe it wil be. Have a good one out there! Joy

      While my complaints in no way match Suz's, I do want to point out another little quirk at CB.  Although messing with quotes appears to be acceptable practice, calling a village a 'town' is not.  That's right. I referred to the town of Buckhorn in my canoe story and the fact checker is making sure that it is, in fact, a town and not a village. ?????  I would understand if this obsessiveness towards accuracy was represented in the rest of the reporting. But the dichotomy is truly odd and a little unnerving.

      While I'm tempted to produce a litany of complaints against my employer and the profession of journalism in general (as practiced in my current job), I'll only add this to the current journalism hate-in. Last week, there was a murder in town. The adult son killed his father on their property. We published the original RCMP release as it came to us 20 minutes before deadline, but we're not allowed to follow it up. That's right. It's the biggest story in the region and we're not allowed to write about it. Not even the court case, the charges laid, nuthin'. There is no story. Why? Because the family called the editor and asked him to ignore it. Completely.  I'm not the sharpest journalistic tool in the shed nor the most enthusiastic reporter, but even I am frustrated by the fact that I'm working for a community newsletter, not a newspaper. When do I get that little card that says "Dues Paid in Full"? On the upside, it's going to be 38 this weekend (no humidity), I live near lakes and rivers and have friends with boats. In the words of Blind Melon, "Life ain't so shitty."

      I think Western's j-school profs would have a fit if they saw how quotes are "massaged" at Canadian Business.  I've been doing a lot of fact checking and often that means comparing the original transcript to the quotes used. And they're not the same! I don't mean just taking out the ums, ahs, and you knows. I mean, essentially paraphrasing the quote (because it doesn't read nice in its original form) and then calling it a quote!   Is anyone else noticing this trend?  And thanks for the baby update James! I'm going to make a special trip to London once you and Erika have settled in with Ellie - don't worry, I won't barge in while you're still trying to adjust to lack of sleep. :)

I found purple shower gel, lotion and poofy thing in a lovely matching flowery gift bag whilst picking up wine bottles off my kitchen floor.  Mitch, is it yours?

      Alright.  I'm tossing my hat into the "journalism is making me sick" ring.  It is literally making me dizzy today.  Spin, spin, spin, puking from too much spin, spin, spin. Puke. Spin.  Company A tells me: We win more than company B. Company B, not surprisingly, tells me they NEVER lose to company A. Ever. Never ever. Non-partisan observer says company B is full of shit.  When I run that comment by company b, it e-mails me way too much information.  Here are the highlights: "In regard to your question, “Does company B lose to company A?”  At the end of the day, no software vendor always wins or always loses – it’s never black and white. ((EDITOR'S NOTE: What part of winning and losing falls into the grey area?))  You win some; you lose some.  Buy what’s most important to point out is that company B only sees company A in a small percentage of deals. ((EDITOR'S NOTE: THAT'S BECAUSE YOU COMPETE IN DIFFERENT MARKETS AND VERTICALS, spin, spin, puke, spin.))  In fact, we see no competition in 33% of active opportunities.  AND – we encourage you to take a look at all of the enterprise win press release we’ve recently issued....  You know what?  Fuck off. Puke.

      Ok, I'm extremely tired of bloody stupid canoes. I write this piece and a bunch of stuff gets cut out. Then the editor in chief takes a look at the story, 'cause he knows a hell of a lot about canoes and asks a bunch of questions (in highly irritating ways) in the text of my story that WERE answered but my editor cut it out.  ARGH. And of course I'm the one who looks like the idiot because it's my story, not the editor who EDITED IT.  do I really want to be a journalist??????

You can't send a link out for that site. There are photo sharing sites where you can, though.  And don't worry. I think you'll be an awesome dad!

      Hi all,  Well no baby yet. Erika went to the doctor this week and was told she is on schedule for her due date. In other words, it could  happen any day now, but not likely until next week. Which means, I had to put the a/c in the window to help cool down the little mamma. Erika's mom is flying in from Montana tomorrow for a month, which should be interesting considering her mom is going to have to sleep on an air mattress. My mother was horrified..."you mean an air mattress on the floor?" Yah, an air mattress on the floor, we do things classy here in the Low residence.  But we have a fancy new crib set up now and we went to Ikea last week to get some little things for the room such as curtains and storage containers. No pastels or pinks for us, little Ellie will think she's growing up in a circus tent. If it was bright and colourful, we bought it.  So as it's getting down to the end, I thought I would share with you how freakin' scared both Erika and I are. We want to hold Ellie and play with her, but kind of freaked out that we're goning to be responsible for another human life other than our own. Because now I've started to think back to all the times I did stuff I wasn't supposed to be doing...you know all the stuff your parents would kill you if they knew what you were doing. Yah. Now we're going to have a little girl doing those exact same things to us.  But there's a little update for now. Someone needs to fill me in on how you post photos to the blog, or if I need to set something up at Yahoo and just link it.  Cheers!  PS - I heard about a canoe story, but this one was knitted by some woman. Yes, knitted.

      It was like the first day of J-school all over again (cue shudder from Carrie): I wrote a story about a fire that killed a dog today. Only the poor thing (Huggy Bear was its name, not Blackie) didn't make the lead--an amputee did. Just goes to show they can't teach you everything you need to know in J-school.. Who knew??!?

      Wow, its been awhile since I posted on here - or had anything to post I guess.  I'm finally joining the ranks of the employed - its been more than two months, so hopefully the wait has been worth it. I'm starting next Monday at the Woolwich Observer in Elmira. I hope it goes alright - I'm surprised they hired me after what I thought was a terrible interview... but it mustn've been that bad if they gave me the job!  One things for sure, it won't be as exciting as the jobs some others have (at the CBC, in Asia, Ghana, etc.,)  Congrats to Caroline, Alex and John who've manageed to escape this country (as nice as it is) and see the world! I'm sure it'll be a great adventure!

      I am an idiot. Stupid stupid me decided that I should be nice and considerate and not step on the other intern's toes today and let her have a story that I would have liked to have done. The problem of course, is that she's already written a story for this issue - a CREDIBLE story - and I'm working on canoes. Yeah. Terrific.  So I am an idiot. And the editors probably think that I have no interest in writing. I guess I just figured that she'd let me have dibs on this one 'cause she'd already written a good story. How silly of me.

      Well, I started at the CBC on Wednesday, and this is shaping up to be the best summer job I've ever had! Not that it has much to live up to (those of you who have heard about the disastrous summers I endured in 2001 and 2002 will know what I'm talking about). I can't believe I considered picking weeds again this summer.  I actually get to do voicers and docs now if I want to! Today I am trying to set up an interview with a female WWE wrestler. Let's see how I do. Kyle - if you want, I can push for getting your doc played in the northeast. Bye guys! Happy (late) Canada Day! Happy July 4th and congratulations to Lindy.

      I tell people this: communications is journalism with a different purpose, yet the techniques you use to get there are the same. I like it, but obviously I'm not as in-depth yet as Lindy, but I see around the office and I notice from some of what I've been doing that yes, indeed, the gripes are the same -- but there are no illusions here -- you serve the client you work for and not some unattainable lofty goal of the greater good.  Come join us on the dark side!

      To answer Becky in a word: Everything. No two days are the same. You can go from doing a brand new ad campaign to writing an annual report to creating an electronic newsletter to creating a branding concept for a new program to searching frantically for a new topic for the weekly news column. Don't get me wrong, it's fun and interesting but the same gripes we had/have about journalism pertain to communications.

The new employees in Bangalore will compile tables of financial data to accompany longer stories written by Reuters journalists elsewhere, and also provide information from news releases, filings to national regulatory authorities such as the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission.

      This is sad, but I watched part of Amish in the City last night. Stupid Sunday night television! Anyway, I thought the whole thing was pretty disrespectful of Amish culture (not that I profess to know much about it). First of all, aren't the Amish opposed to even having their pictures taken? I think that having a trashy reality TV show featuring their young people is probably the opposite of what most Amish people would want.  I was also taken aback by how some of the "roommates" were mocking the Amish kids because they didn't know who Bob Marley is. This program is set up a little like a freak show - laugh at the weird kids who grew up outside modern culture!  That being said, some of the Amish characters are more "right off the farm" than others. There is one Amish girl who seems to be rather sophistocated - she's been working as a waitress for awhile. I liked this one character (I think his name is Mose) who didn't care about being mocked, and said he was proud of his roots.  It's really sad that this is how many people are going to learn about Amish culture.

      So it's been over a week since the wee little bean joined our family. Erika and I are both walking zombies, although Eleanor is still the sweetest little girl -- when she needs to eat she doesn't mince her words -- or her wails! Everyone warns you that life will be different when you have kids and you sort of accept it before the big day arrives. Yet, I cannot even begin to describe how profoundly different our lives are now, but it's all for the better.  I will be working at McGill & Partners Communications full-time this fall. I've been working there and up at the university this summer. Busy, busy. At McGill, I have and will be doing research and writing. I've been gathering information for 3M Canada on corporate philanthropy -- because they want a good cause to give money to -- how 'bout me? Then I've been conducting market research and interviewing people in the know. I also write corporate newsletters -- including all the upcoming edition of ClimateCare's "A Matter of Comfort". Thrilling, eh? This whole job stemmed from the mysterious "internship" Diny Dalby spoke about in class. So now they've asked me to stay on, which I'm willing to do because lets face it -- they've got more money to throw at me than the Grand Forks Gazette did. Exactly how much remains to be seen. But I'm just relieved I will be employed come September 1.  In the meantime, I'm also volunteering my time to Terri at Scene -- just to keep my self honest. Although communications and advertising can be at times more fun than reporting -- plus in my humble opinion -- I think it's more creative than stodgy ol' journalism -- yet my heart is still with journalism. I will continue to keep my feet wet and look for the dream job.  The shepherding thing has been fun. The new group is a lot of fun. It's been a riot laughing and joking with a new crowd of people going through exactly what we did last year.  All is well. The baby is finally asleep! Whew. I had her in my arms while I was writing and then her deep-sleep sighs started. Because I think Ellie has her days and nights mixed up, I need to sleep before her 2am party begins. (Oops..I think I spoke too soon! It may be starting early tonight.)  I hope everyone is well. Play safe.

      I really question the authenticity of this show. I was reading through their bios and I think they've all left their communities 'cause they all have outside jobs! Factory worker, construction worker, waitress, etc. I don't question that this may be the first time they went to Hollywood, but I figure they've been living in small town USA for a while now.  The name of the show shouldn't be Amish in the City, but Almost Amish in the City.

      I am caught in a power struggle and I am constantly losing. He holds all the power. He is capable of inflicting hours of frustration followed by hours of uncertainty and hurt. For him, the post-argument call back is    an option .     It isn't new. We have an argument (degree and severity don't seem to affect the pattern) and we hang up. I am usually crying, he is usually annoyed. Almost immediately I want to call back. I cannot simply leave the incident hanging. He, on the other hand, can leave it hanging and appears to prefer it that way. When the "talk" button is pressed or the dial button is pushed, and we are are cut off from one another, it is over. For him.   I want to, need to, finish it. If I call back I am giving in and doing what I always do, which is call back. If I don't I will be the only one of us feeling tormented. If I don't call back I will show him and he will know who's is boss. Nope. He won't even realize that I haven't called back. He will probably go and get something to eat. He will even    sleep .     Depending on how long I can hold out, I will either spend an hour waiting for the phone to ring or wait up all night. My mind will start to play tricks on me. It will tell me that he is doing this intentionally. That he knows he has the power and he is wielding it with cruel indifference. I will worry and I will cry. It will reflect on our relationship. It will make me feel unloved and unworthy. Then I will get angry that he could be so mean and hurtful after something so silly. That he would put me through such anguish over something so insignificant...what kind of psycho IS he?   I will write about it. Think about it and ache over it's deeper ramifications. In the morning, he will call. He won't know why I sound so tired or what I am upset about. If I bring it up, I am being petty and holding a grudge...I am being silly.   I am trapped and he has won. I cannot see any way to win. If I call, I am weak. If I don't, I remain upset. If I don't care, our friendhip suffers. If I care my sanity and self-esteem suffers. He is all powerful. He wins...

      Well, here I am in Edmonton. It was summer in London and it's early spring in Edmonton. I should have known that but for some reason I had forgotten how different it was here. It's great to be back though. When I was in Ontario I would get all excited everytime I saw an Alberta license plate. I haven't yet broken that habit and so I have been excited - a lot - since I got here. It's always weird when you live somewhere else for a year or two; when you return it's almost like you never left. I am in the same house, with the same people, that I was in this time last year only now I have a Master's degree. Very weird.  I saw Gina last night and today we are going to West Edmonton Mall...she's buying, I'm watching.  urlLink Ian and Bobbi  are both at the house so I have seen them and most importantly I have been reunited with my adorable, lovable Shabba. It's so great to hold him and hear him purring again. When he sleeps on my head at night and purrs like a little machine, I can't help but feel that everything is right with the world. That is until I start to sneeze. I am allergic to my best friend.

      Today is my last day in London...I am leaving tomorrow to go home. I feel mostly good about it, relieved actually. I don't like it here. I like it even less with no job, few friends, no money and no possesions. I am on a first name basis with the guy at the Greyhound station (Jack - see, I told you.) who has been helping me ship my stuff home. Every day I lug five big boxes downstairs, to my car and out again at the station. My body hurts and my belongings are probably in the Manitoba vortex somewhere.  I got royally screwed up the ass the other day by the girl I am subletting this apartment from. I sold her some of my furiture, which was exciting because it's all I have to sell, and we agreed that she would pay me $185. We also agreed that I would pay $30 for the three days past the 15th that I have been stayed. By the time she got home that night and emailed me, she was charging me $150 for the extra three days and just calling us "even" with the furniture. Arrgghh!! I wrote her back, which felt great, and told her where she could go. So far, no response. I am giving my furniture away to the girl next door and leaving...I don't get any money out of it, but at least she won't get the furniture. Some people.  Brian officially quit his job yesterday. He was pretty nervous about it but I think he feels better now that it's done. Soon enough our little adventure will be underway.

      I am up late again. The days have been really hot and at night the rain keeps me awake. Mostly because it is coming through the ceiling above my bed. Only a few more nights in this apartment before I leave.   I like this apartment, despite its dripping roof. I like the yellow walls. I like that it is so small - it's cozy. I like that you have to duck so you don't hit your head coming into the bedroom. I love the squirrels that play outside my window. I love that it is mine. This could very well be the last place I live in that belongs entirely to me. I can walk around naked, and I do. I can get up in the middle of the night to make waffles, and I have. I can take three baths a day. I can have a dance party. I can clean like a neurotic obsessive compulsive or let the dishes pile up to the ceiling. I can put on my music as loud as I like. I can set my alarm for whatever ridiculous hour I please. I can vacuum at midnight.   I have been packing like a maniac all day. I miss Brian and I am worried about everything. I try not to be. I try to stay positive and I feel pretty happy, but there is a nagging fear that will not go away. I could easily be mistaking uncertaintly for fear...I have done that before. I don't know where we are moving or when and he and I have been apart for so long. It is hard to stay together when, well, when you never are. It is hard to stay on the same track when you only see each other every few weeks. If Brian and I make it through this, and I hope we do, it will have been the hardest thing I have ever done.   I was watching Dr.Phil the other day (my addiction to him deserves an entire entry if not its own blog) and he said that the way he measures himself as a husband and as a man is when he can say that if his wife were standing in a room full of a thousand other women, he knows that she would feel certain that none of them are treated better than she is. I thought about that when he said it and realized that I have exactly that. That makes me pretty lucky and sometimes I am far too quick to forget how lucky I am.

      Well, it's another grey day in London, Ontario. I can't believe that nobody ever warned me about this weather before I moved here! You would think that someone would have thought to mention..."Just so you know, it's wet and grey and cold there everyday for most of the year. Oh and it rains all the time. And you'll never see the sun. Enjoy!" You would think, wouldn't you?  So it looks like I am going to Korea to teach English. Or maybe Taiwan. Either way, I am not hopping aboard the train headed for career, family and security. Yay!! I have avoided it for at least one more year. It was close...I saw that train approaching down the tracks and for awhile it looked appealing. The shiny engine, the hypnotizing hum of the rails, the plush seats where you can relax and watch the world pass you by. Watch the world pass you by!?!?! Wait a minute - I don't want THAT!   Now I have a million decisions to make about moving, selling my car, buying plane tickets, choosing a destination, packing boxes...from the minute details to the big picture. It's kind of stressful since every decision seems to be leading to five more but that's life I guess.

      Me again. So, that last post was so typically me I can hardly handle it. You know when I wrote it? October 2003. It's May, 2004. That's how long I left it between posts...  So what to do? Be honest, leave it standing or take advantage of my technological capacity for erasing the past and just start over? Change the date and pretend I just wrote it. That way I will look more responsible when the posts fall soon after each other. Responsible to whom you may ask? I don't know. I try not to ask too many questions about myself.   My goal is to start packing today. I am moving. I just don't know where I am moving yet. I might be going home to stay with my parents right now, I might go to Philadelphia to see Brian, I might go to Korea to teach English. Maybe I will go to the island of Tonga and sell pooka-shell necklaces on the beach.   I am embarking on a self-help project. I am usually opposed to these, partly because they sound so incredibly self-absorbed and egocentric and partly because they sound like a lot of work. I cannot shake the idea that self-improvement books and exercises are for froo-froo neurotics with too much time on their hands. But here I am, saying "self-improvement exercises", worrying whether this pursuit makes me a bad person and facing all the time in the world. I rest my case.   I need to stop being so hard on myself. And on other people. I need to learn how to relax and gain some perspective. I need to be happy and I want the people around me to be happy too. The 21st century's Ark of the Covenant...happiness. But Indiana Jones is hoped up on Prozac somewhere in Southern California.

      So, here it is...my first Blog. After dragging my feet and fighting against the ever encroaching plague of technology I have succumbed. So now what? I thought I would start by telling you a bit about myself. I will disperse with the necessary but meaningless: I am a 26-year-old (gulp, dare I say it?) woman. I hate that word. I still think of myself as girl or a "chick" but never a woman. I wonder why that is? Anyway...   I recently finished journalism school at the University of Western Ontario in fake London. Where everything is named after the real London but nothing is even remotely like the real London. What this city lacks in creativity it makes up with its strangeness. Not quite big, not quite small, it is full of money and trees. It is situated on the banks of the Thames River. Downtown houses St. Paul's cathedral. There is Oxford Street, Piccadilly Square, Covent Garden Market, Middlesex College and Trafalgar Park. Pall Mall Street leads to Victoria Park. Wait, it gets better. On Saturday mornings in the summertime there is a red double-decker bus that drives people around. I am not kidding. I wish I were.   Okay, back to me. How do I go about describing myself? The problem with this is that people often do not see themselves how other people see them. If you know me will you even recognize me in my own description? Do I try to imagine what others might see? Maybe a little bit of both...   I see myself a little differently every day. I am sensitive and funny. In a twisted, irreverent kind of way. Jesus jokes are my stock in trade. I feel things passionately. This is both a blessing and a curse. Sometimes I feel so happy and awed by the world around me that I feel as though my head could burst. When I feel down it gets so bad that I have to try my damnedest not to walk in front of a bus.   I am extroverted in that I am outgoing and energetic. (Okay, some may call me loud.) In contrast I am also a homebody. There is nothing I love more than a hot bath, flannel pajamas and a good book. I love to dance and my favourite place to do that is in my bedroom in front of the mirror. That way I can go through an infinite number of "costume changes" if I see fit.   I cry easily but I laugh even easier. I feel passionately about everything and I love to explore the world around me. I have a Bachelor's degree in Neuroscience from the University of Lethbridge in Alberta. For my honours thesis I studied the effects of Prozac, Amphetamines and Ecstasy on dendritic morphology. I really love science. I love the rational nature of it. I love the scientific method and I am frustrated when other people fail to see its eloquence and usefullnes.. You have a hypothesis or a question, you test it with an open mind, in an honest attempt at finding the truth, you examine the evidence objectively and then you answer the question. Its perfect. It allows for errors and mistakes to be celebrated as advancements and I don't know anywhere else where that is the case.   I am tired of writing. I always have such high expectations when I begin to write, only to find that I soon begin to peter out. That's what is so great about blogging though - it doesn't really matter.

      I am leaving to live in  urlLink Daegu , South Korea within the next few weeks. I feel pretty excited. I don't really know what to expect and I am going to be teaching English, which has little to nothing to do with journalism, but I'm okay. I am hoping that I can do some freelancing or work for a paper in Daegu. We'll see.   Brian and I are homeless for the time being and have been gallavaniting across Alberta's wide countryside. A week in Fort McMurray with my family and then back to Edmonton. Another week down in Raymond with Brian's Mum.   Raymond...how do I describe Raymond? It's a small (about 2,500 people) Southern Alberta Mormon town. It's an hour from the Montana border. There are about half a dozen churches and everyone knows everyone. On Saturdays the kids play football. On Sundays the town goes to church and then to a picnic. On Monday the family gets together to read scriptures and have a "home evening". There are family reunions in the summer time and on the first of July the town is comprised of about 60% Utah license plates. It was founded by Mormon pioneers and a lot of weight is attached to whether you are related to one of those pioneers. They don't call anyone by their first name because most people fit into a far neater category... a West, a Smith or a Beazer. If someone knows your last name, they know you. They know your family history, your geneology, who married who, whether or not your family is "trouble" and every little dark secret someone in your family may have tried to hide. There are as many American flags on the houses as there are Canadian. There is no bar or saloon. There is however, a Subway sandwich shop.   The streets in Raymond are extremely wide, at least double the width of typical residential streets. I have been told it's because they need to be wide anough to turn a wagon around in them but I am not entirely convinced. People are friendly and when they meet you they want to know your last name and where you come from. People have a lot of kids on average. People own a lot of trucks on average. All the women bake and bottle fruit and all the little girls take piano lessons. All the little boys look forward to their mission.   Raymond is the kind of place that you might like to hate, but you can't. It's quiet and simple and even a little creepy sometimes but it's nice. You feel safe and taken care of. Nothing much ever happens and everyone knows who you are. You cannot hide and I suppose a lot of people like it that way. Me? I prefer to visit.

      So I finished   urlLink The DaVinci Code  ...in one sitting. It was an easy read but it kept me turning the pages. I am not sure how much of it is based on fact and how much on the crazy rantings of conspiracy theorists but it was interesting nonetheless. It's based on the 80's bestseller  The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail  and basically deals with the persistent rumours of a secret society dedicated to protecting documents that would rock Christianity to it's core. (Bring it on I say!) The documents are said to prove that the divinity of Christ was invented 300 years after he died and that he was married with a child. The ramifications of these claims are of course, obvious. The book is well written and fairly convincing, although some of it is too far fetched. Not as far fetched as a prophesied virgin-birth, walking on water and a reincarnation, but whatever.  Since we are on the subject of religion and it's one that I love so much, I have learned some cool things lately. I am reading a book on geography and I am really enjoying it. I have learned some really interesting things, such as the history of the story of Atlantis (mythological of course but first introduced by Plato of all people! Thought to be the fanciful re-telling of the Island of  Thera) and that Christopher Columbus never actually reached the shores of the United States of America and that he died thinking he had reached China. I mean, I never really believed he had discovered America or anything (after all, it's difficult to discover something if more than 40 million people are already living there!) but I have to admit that I did think he had actually reached America. Just goes to show you...anyways, I digress. What was I talking about? Oh yeah, good 'ol religion...  After reading about St.Augustine and early Roman history I learned that St. Augustine really struggled with the idea that there may be more than three continents. The Bible names only three continents (one for each of Noah's descendants) and the idea that a new continent had been discovered set up a huge contradiction between scripture and science (surely not the last!) that he could not comprehend. This made me happy. Obviously we, as a society, have globally accepted the existence of more than three continents. We have relied on evidence and proof and the rational has prevailed! This means that, given enough time, we can do that again. Creationism will eventually be abandoned and evolution (or a better, more unifying theory yet) will be adopted...universally. The human condition marches on...  Brian and I have been on vacation for the last two days and have accomplished nothing. We both have this weird stomach bug that makes us a little reluctant to leave our apartment. Let's just say that finding a public washroom in Daegu seems to be a difficult feat. We have slept a lot and read a lot and eaten very little. It sucks because it's not very often that we get days off work, but what can you do? We are hoping to do more tomorrow and maybe go to the museum or at least downtown.

      Happy Birthday  urlLink Gina ! I miss you...I hope you are having a wonderful time...   I am so sick today...again. I guess I got what Brian had. Grrr...   For any Vonnegut fans out there, check this out.  urlLink Pure genius .   Oh yeah...do you remember that cute little pillow that I bought at E-Mart a couple of days ago? It broke. In the middle of the night. In the bed, under the covers. And it was full of billions of tiny polystyrene beads. They are everywhere...and I mean everywhere. At least it was easy to "roll" out of bed in the morning.

       Today we went downtown and finally found the map that Brian has desperately been wanting. Apparently he needs a visual map of where we are. I don't really care where we are...it all looks the same to me. Just another difference between men and women I think. Anyway, after downtown we caught a cab to  urlLink E-Mart , Korea's equivalent of Wal-Mart. It was pretty much what I expected - huge, full of lots of goodies and  urlLink teeming with people . The escalators were the ramp kind with no stairs. I felt so much like herded cattle that I was nervous someone was going to whip out a stun-gun on the sporting goods level. No such luck.   &nbsp;It was actually pretty cool. They had a section of massage chairs/beds and it was full of people  urlLink test driving  the products. It was mostly old people in the chairs and some of them looked like they may have died at some point between massage cycles. One man's head was being shaken so hard I was afraid he was going to have some kind of frontal lobe damage when he eventually did get up. It might have been better had he died in the chair.   I bought some house slippers, a pillow and some other small odds and ends. Korean houses have an underfloor heating system and so people always take off their shoes inside. It used to consist of a fire and heating ducts but now it relies on the hotwater pipes running under the floor. It's a neat idea but I don't really understand why it requires different footware. I'll just keep playing along. It does help explain the whole "sandal with socks phenomenon"...but not entirely.   We got into the cab today and I asked the driver to take us&nbsp;to E-Mart. Nothing. I asked again, nothing. Brian tried "E-Mart-uh". Instant recognition. Turns out that in the Korean language, certain sounds cannot finish a syllable or word. This is why my students (and many of the Korean teachers) change page to "pagey" and English to "Englishey" (  urlLink  Engrishey    to be exact). The other sound they add is "uh"...thus, E-Mart uh . The things you learn.   The car horns here have a built in fade to them. It's weird because it kind of mimics the Doppler effect and it trips me out every time. You push the horn once and it gradually fades over a few seconds. No explanation yet to accompany the observation.   So everyone here are wearing  urlLink sunvisors  to protect them from the sun. Mostly the women, but I have seen some men wearing them too. Some go so far as to wear gloves, visors and use parasols (I never thought I would use  that  word in a sentence beyond my 8th birthday...I wanted a parasol for my birthday. I didn't get it) but I have yet to see a pair of sunglasses. I have so much to learn.

      Korea is a very secular nation, which makes me very happy. As a  urlLink secular humanist  it is good to know that those who choose to practice their religion are allowed to do so in a benign way and that those who choose not to are treated fairly. So unlike so many other places. Athiests are one of the last remaining vestiges of acceptable discrimination in the modern world. In a recent survey, 46% of Americans said they would never vote for an athiest as President. So much for the separation of church and state. We have so much work to do.   &nbsp;

       urlLink Cicadas . The trees on the way to work are full of them and they are  loud.  SO loud. They chirp/screech at the most horrible frequency and Brian and I can't even hear each other over the cacophony. But it got me thinking...how do they know when to start and when to stop? There are hundreds, maybe even thousands of them and all of a sudden the singing (and I use that term loosely) will just cease. It's a little eerie. It's like applause I suppose (bear with me here). You are at a performance and it ends, everyone starts clapping. Who claps first? How do you know how long to clap? It can't always be directly proportional to your appreciation, because surely not everyone will enjoy a performance to the same degree. Who claps last? Who is the brave soul who determines, that's enough. This clapping should end now. Who notices and then decides that he/she should also stop clapping because  that  guy did? Who is the last to clap and why? Makes you wonder doesn't it?   My Dad will be happy to know that I think of him every time I see a Hyundai Santa Fe (for those of you who don't know, Ed owns one and  loves  it. He even calls it by it's full name, "I'm going to go and wash the Hyundai Santa Fe.") and I am thinking about him a lot. They are every where. The manufacturing plant is in Ulsan, on the South East coast, and it is apparently very prolific. They are ubiquitous. Maybe if North and South Korea ever reunify they will put the  Santa Fe  on the new flag .  "The New Korea. Rugged, stylish and oh so spiffy."   Brian is sick as a dog today. He has a bad cold and just needs to get lots of rest and drink fluids...you know the deal. The Koreans apparently don't look at things the same way we do. They wanted him to go to the hospital! Last week I had a stomach bug and they wanted me to go to the hospital and take medicine. What kind of medicine you ask? That's not the point...you just need to take  some  kind of medicine. They have tonics and pills for everything, it's unbelievable. I finally explained to the Korean teachers that Brian would not be going to the hospital. They said he is very strong and brave. Yeesh. It's very difficult for Brian and I to handle since we are both skeptics and fully aware of the dangers of overprescribing antibiotics etc. Reiki, reflexology, you name it. It drives me bonkers and this country eats it up. This place is a  urlLink skeptics  nightmare.

      We went  urlLink downtown  today in search of an English map of Daegu. We found downtown but no map. The city centre is not too far from where we live...about a 10 minute cab ride (so that's about three bucks!) It was quite busy down there today and full of sights and sounds to remind you that you are still in Asia. I went to try and buy some clothes and found that I am fitting into a large for the first time in my life! Simple things like asking how much something costs become a series of grunts and gestures (despite our ever-present Korean phrasebook) and the smells...oh the smells. I don't know if it's sewage or dead animals but every once and awhile you will catch a sniff of something so horrid that it makes your head spin. It doesn't last too long but it's incredibly powerful for the few moments it lasts. (Brian swears up and down that this country reeks - permanently, but I don't find it that bad.) There are street vendors selling fruit drinks and  bondagi  (fried silkworm larvae), and knock-off Fendi bags and oodles and oodles of cellphone accessories. It's crowded and colourful (they may be able to make me drop the  ou  in school but this is Caroline's blog. This is my world, and the  ou  and  re  stay) and you get bumped, jostled and plain knocked-around. There are mopeds and cars driving on the sidewalks and nobody knows English. It's fantastic.   Every once and awhile we will encounter some young kids who will proceed to elbow each other and giggle as soon as they see us. This is usually followed up with a giggled "Hello" to which we respond equally. This response is met with guffaws (more giggles in the case of the girls) and maybe a "Good-bye" as they flee the scene. We usually just laugh and play along like we get the joke. The only problem is I think  we  might be the joke.   We are much taller than everyone in this country. There are some tall Koreans but Brian is still a head taller than them. Yesterday I saw a tall man and got quite excited that I had found my first tall Korean...the guy turned out to be white. Whoops.   We went to Kyobo today and bumped into some other whities in the book store. They were both from Vancouver. You gotta love Canadians - they're every where! We chatted in the English section for awhile and they seemed pretty cool. I bought  The DaVinci Code  while I was there. I usually don't buy the bestsellers but I read the book that led to this one being written (  urlLink The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail )  and I am interested in Brown's interpretation. Will let you know what I think.   I always knew that tomatoes were fruit. People always get a real kick out of informing you, "Did you know that tomatoes are actually a fruit"? Uh, yah. I also know that the brazil nut is not truly a nut - it's a seed. (I know - sign me up for Jeopardy. Hee.) Anyway, here, the tomato is truly treated as an equal to it's more recognized fruity counterparts. We went to Baskin Robbins today for an iced coffee and they have this wonderful invention called an "ice cream fondue" (again, ingenious). It has little balls of ice-cream, pieces of sponge cake and fresh fruit that you dip in melted chocolate. The fruit looked delicious...bananas, kiwi, stawberries and...tomatoes? What the hell? Yup, tomatoes.

      So, I wouldn't say we have been lied to so much as misled. We kind of misled ourselves I guess. When we signed on for this job in Korea, we were promised 10 days holiday and every national holiday, of which there are 20+. Great! That's like a month off in total right? Wrong. Holidays in Korea happen on the weekend. Oh the misery! Since this country consists entirely of workaholics hell-bent on defeating the Japanese, the work week is six-days long. So that means that any holidays that fall on a Saturday are holidays for the Koreans but not for us. It's also different from at home in that if it falls on a Sunday that does not mean you get Monday off work. No way. So as it turns out, this year New Year's falls on a Friday. No day off! Christmas? Saturday. I swear this is some kind of sick joke.   It has been so hot here...above 35 degrees Celsius every day. Our apartment has AC though and so does work. Thank goodness.   I have a confession to make. I have done some internal "tssking" in my life at people who have made fun of the way Asian people talk. The whole L and R thing - I thought it was exaggerated if not false. It's neither. We have a reading book at school and one of the character's names is Larry. If I hear "Rarry" one more time I am going to scream! Rarry and "peesh" for fish. They have a hard time with  R, L, F, P  and  W.  I stand corrected...and amused.

      My kids at school were so bad today. They actually made me cry (which admittedly isn't all that difficult, but still...) and what makes it worse is that my partner teacher went and  told  the class they made me cry. Oh good.   Other than that things are going fairly well. I am having a hard time getting to a computer. I can check my email but as far as posting on the blog goes, it takes too much time. There are two computers at work and about 10 people wanting to use them at any one time. I have started "blogging" at home on my laptop and figure I can just post them when I get a chance. It's not perfect but it's going to have to do. I think Brian and I are going to end up getting internet at the house pretty soon. We'll see...   I ate octopus for lunch today. It didn't taste too bad (like rubber really) but the suckers on the tentacles sort of stuck to my throat. They eat live octopus here in Korea (mine was dead, thankfully) and apparently every year one or two people die from the octopus' suckers attaching to their wind pipe. What a way to go! For the octopus and the wind pipe..."The Octopus and the Wind pipe" that sounds like a good name for a story. Heh.   Brian is having a harder time adapting to things here than I am. Could be the one ice-cold beer I drink everyday after work that is making the difference. The beer isn't that good but it goes down smooth and bubbly. Just the way I like it! I look forward to that beer (I have limited myself to just one...so far) everyday as it has come to signify the end of the day and a retreat back into normality. Oh God, I sound like an alcoholic. Here's a quick side note: normality. It's such a good word. It sufficiently describes what it is intended do and so, fulfills the purpose of a word. Why, in 1956, did some dude invent normalcy? I don't know but it bugs me. It doesn't bug me as much as the more recent trend towards blending the two words into "normalacy". Just one of my little grammatical pet peeves.   Anywhoo...   We have been noticing that a lot of the cars around here have little cross-stitched pillows in the windows. Most of them have a phone number and "I'm Sorry" or "I love you". At first we thought people left them on car windows after a parking lot collision or something, but it turns out they are for parking. It is illegal to park on the street here and so, if you have to nip into a store quickly, you can put the pillow on your window so they can call you on your cellphone. Not a bad idea! They have a lot of good ideas in this country, (they have some bad ones too but I am trying to stay positive and culturally respectful) like handles on their watermelons. When you buy a watermelon it comes in a rope "basket" with a handle. Ingenious.   I got my alien card today. I am now officially a legal alien. Very cool.

      Today is supposedly the first&nbsp;day of the three hottest days of the year in Korea. It is no coincidence that it is also the day set aside to eat sacholt'ang&nbsp;- or dog soup. It is believed to be very healthy and is also thought to provide stamina in the bedroom. Move over Viagra, here comes Poochie.  &nbsp; Let's talk about squat toilets for a moment shall we? It's not that I have a problem with them because I don't. I am a squatter from way back. It makes as much sense anatomically as western-style toilets and they aren't difficult to use. I am able and willing to admit that I did encounter some backsplash problems during the first couple of days, but the problem has since been fixed. Facing the right way has made a world of difference. My problem is that the plumbing here cannot handle toilet paper (or so they claim). This means that at a school with 600 hundred students, there is a huge amount of discarded and  used  toilet paper in the garbage can. It smells okay at about 11 in the morning, but by late afternoon the stench is overwhelming. The fact that I can conveniently flush the toilet with my foot doesn't outpower the smell...ugh. &nbsp; YAK. Have you heard of it? It's awesome. I know this probably sounds like an advertisement but, what the heck...if you like a product, endorse it! All you have to do is dial 10-15-945 from any phone in Canada and it is SO cheap! It goes right on your home telephone bill and there is no need to sign up! Ha! Ha! You can call the US for about 5 cents a minute and I think it's only about 9 cents to call here. Yak away people, Yak away.  &nbsp;

      I am feeling pretty sick. New bugs, new foods...my immune forces are weakened. We are being attacked from behind. We have crossed enemy lines and the enemy is winning...  &nbsp;  Ah, sorry. I spent all day yesterday in bed. If I have learned anything in life it's that lying in bed and thinking is not good for me. My brain gets away from me and I feel like I'm on a runaway train with no driver. But as the infamous Cliff Lonsdale once said (a thousand times) I digress...  &nbsp;  I made up a joke the other day:  What do you call an epileptic covered in croutons?  A seizure salad.  &nbsp;  Oh god.

      A kid in my class today was wearing a white outfit with the words "Gay Land" written all over it. His name was Leo...or maybe it was Roy. I teach 91 kids and there are probably only 15-20 names between them. Each child is assigned an English name when they enroll at the school and the teachers who have been doling out the names are either very lazy or extremely unimaginative. Sally. Annie. Max. Justin. Sam. Molly. Juliet. Mat. Gina. Oh and I also have a Hans and&nbsp;a Hoya. One day someone got creative.  &nbsp;  We went to the immigration office today to register with the local "authorities". It involved a taxi cab ride from one end of the city to the other and back again. It was a great chance to see Daegu. It's a huge city (pop. 2.7 million) and we haven't really learned our way around yet. The taxi ride only cost us $10 for the roundtrip and about about five years from my life. The driving here is insane. There are no lanes, no rules and no seatbelts. Just a blur of cars and a string of near misses.  &nbsp;  I am sitting here writing in a PC bang ("bang" seems to mean room.&nbsp;There are DVD bangs where you can rent a DVD and watch it in your own private screening room)&nbsp;with about 100 other people. All I can hear is shooting noises and groaning. The kids here are really into PC games and it's kind of eerie sitting in a room with so many people and everyone glued to their screen. Ah well...&nbsp;

      I burned my hair today and had to cut it off. Apparently a Canadian curling iron plugged into a 220v electrical system just gets twice as hot. Who knew? The sizzling sound that occurred as soon as the barrel touched my hair was accompanied by large amounts of smoke. I am sad to say that the frizzled mess that remained could not be saved.  &nbsp;  Here is something I learned today: Koreans don't count their age the same way we do. When they are born they are 1 year old. I couldn't figure it out, because all of my kids look younger than they say they are. Eventually someone explained to me that they are actually one year younger by North American standards. See, this is why traveling is so great. I had no idea that Asians did that! Now I do. Such is life.  &nbsp;  Things at the school are progressing quickly. I am getting used to teaching, although the pace still blows me away. We have about 90 students each and between six and eight classes a day. Each class is 40 minutes. We are expected to cover about four or five contents in each call and so we teach at break-neck speed. The Korean teachers (who for the first week are observing our classes and acting as translators) do the most annoying things, like counting 5-4-3-2-1 for every little thing I ask the kids to do. The weird part is, there is no consequence if the the teacher gets to one and nothing has happened, she just starts again. Weird. There is a lot of chanting and repetition going on but I can't shake the feeling that the kids are  not  learning much English. If you ask them "How are you?" they will rattle off, "I am well thank you, and you?" like they have been speaking English all their lives. Ask them "How are you today?" and they stare at you with blank looks on their faces. It is going to be hard not get frustrated because the school doesn't  want  us to stop and make sure everyone understands, they want the kids to memorize the words and spit them out again in a passable accent. I guess it's not that different from public school back home.  &nbsp;

      They had us start teaching today. Yesterday we observed the classes and today we taught...these Koreans don't mess around. I think it went okay. I don't really know, I have never done this before. They asked us at the end of the day which class went the best/worst and I couldn't even dissociate between any of my classes! They were all just one big blur of kids. We are working from 11 until 9 for the first week and I can see already I how tired I am going to be by Friday. After two solid months of unemployment and the lax schedule of j-school,&nbsp;the Korean work schedule&nbsp;is going to kick my ass.  &nbsp;  I have good news and bad news. Good news is, we have a television. In my former life this wouldn't have been a good thing, but here it provides me with a soft place to fall at the end of the day. The bad news? One of the only English stations is the American Forces Network. The military presence here is still quite strong given that S. and N. Korea are still technically at war (although this most be the longest cease-fire in the history of man kind) and I am being forced to watch the military propaganda between shows. "Ally McBeal" - report human trafficking - "Who Wants to Marry my Dad?" - Don't sell or buy on the black market - "The Simple Life" - Don't point your guns at Civilians. It's a schizophrenic experience to say the least.  &nbsp;  Our bedroom window faces the  urlLink main stre et (and by street I mean alley) and I have been sitting and watching the streets below like it's my own private soap opera. Ay home, we live our lives behind closed doors. Here, everything is public. Mr.Lee and his friends drink outside the shop every night and their laughter, even though it makes no sense to me, makes me smile. The kids  urlLink ride bikes  in circles in the streets, often narrowly escaping being hit by a car. They fight and scream at each other. Last night I heard a sole voice singing as he walked into the darkness. There is a crazy lady who hobbles up and down the streets calling for someone who never answers. It's real. I find it fascinating to watch and it makes me feel connected to my neighbourhood and to the people around me, even though I cannot understand what they are saying.

      We finally arrived in Korea after a two day delay. Our passports which, according to the Korean Embassy in Vancouver, were sent on Friday arrived at the house Tuesday with a stamp saying they had been mailed on Monday. Hmmm...  &nbsp;  Either way, we are here now. We got in on Friday night after a grueling five hour bus ride. Brian and I got off the plane in Seoul quite chuffed with ourselves. Thinking ourselves to be seasoned travelers we remarked on how easy the trip was. (Asides from the fact that people were smoking in the airplane washroom...let me say that smelling smoke at 30,000 feet is NOT a pleasant feeling.)&nbsp;What we didn't know was that it wasn't even close to being over! We arrived in Korea at 3:30 in the afternoon and got to Daegu at 1:00 on Saturday morning. Ugh.  &nbsp;  This morning I awoke to what I thought was the police yelling for someone to come out of their house. It was loud and insistent. It was blaring in my window and it was more than a little annoying. When I finally mustered up the energy sit up and look out my window I saw that it was actually a guy selling watermelons out of the back of his truck. How quaint. The parade of speaker-bearing salesmen continued through the morning. Onions. Garlic. Televisions. The list of items one can purchase of the back of a moving truck appears to be endless. I wonder if any of them sell earplugs?  &nbsp;  Our little apartment is above a  urlLink corner store  owned by a Mr.Lee. (Of course it is!) It sells beer and milk and a lot of other things that I cannot yet identify. Mr. Lee appears to be friendly enough but there are sordid rumours circling around the neighbourhood about Mr.Lee and his dog. Apparently he  really  loves his  urlLink dog . Nuff' said.  &nbsp;   We went downtown today with Andrea and Ryan, two teachers from New Brunswick, who were kind enough to show us around. We went downtown and ate galbi at a small restaurant off a side road. It was delicious! Galbi consists of marinated pork (I abandoned vegetarianism until I can learn how to order and what's what) that you cook on a grill at your table. It was so good and came with at least a dozen side-dishes. Kimchi being one of them, of course. Kimchi is a Korean staple and probably best described&nbsp; as this country's french fry. It comes with everything and there is always lots of it. It's a&nbsp;spicy dish made of fermented cabbage and hot chili paste. It's pretty good actually.  &nbsp;  We start school tomorrow at  urlLink Ding Ding Dang . If this is my last entry, I guess it means I was swallowed alive by the Korean education system...or by the kids themselves.

      Ha! Joke's on me. We are still in Edmonton and it is definitely more than a week since I last posted. Damn Korean Embassy lost our passports. We are leaving tomorrow though - I'll believe it when I land in Incheon.   Read  urlLink J Unrau's blog  today. Unbelievably well done and very interesting. Exactly what I would expect from him.   I went to see  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  yesterday. I wasn't sure if I was going to like it but I did. I have heard all the complaints but I can't say that any of them were really convincing. Were there some factual errors? Probably, but none of them was major enough to affect the integrity of the film. I left the theatre feeling upset - primarily because it left me disheartened about the situation in the middle east and secondly because I felt so frustrated that George W. Bush has at least a chance at getting re-elected. Wasn't once enough? Moore used some really effective cinematic devices such as letting the screen go black as the audio from September 11th played on. We have seen those images so many times that (dare I say it) we have become somewhat immune to them. Sitting in that dark theatre, hearing the sounds of planes hitting concrete and the&nbsp;screaming...it was horrific.  &nbsp;  I have to say though that nothing in the film really  surprised  me. I already knew Bush was crooked and I suspected there were connections with the Carlyle group. What continues to frustrate me is that so many people just don't see it.

      I went to a store called Hot Tracks today - it's a huge place full of thousands of different notebooks and coloured pencils. This country is a stationary lovers dream. Hot Tracks also sells music. You are never going to believe what I found in the New Release section...no seriously. New Kids on the Block. They put out a new album of their greatest (and not so great) hits. Could life get any better?

      The Korean peninsula is divided by a demilitarized zone or DMZ. The strip of land is 4 km wide and 240 km long from coast to coast. It was created in 1953 when an armistice ended the Korean War. Because the two Koreas are still   technically   at war, the zone remains enclosed in barbed-wire fences, dotted with land mines and guarded by thousands of soldiers. Ok, so far, nothing really new right? So here we go...  In 1955, the two Koreas decided to each build "model" villages on their side of the DMZ. The idea was that each village would highlight the superiority of their way of life. The Northern village is called Gijeong, the Southern, Daeseong Village. Over the past 50 odd years, each country has thrown wads of cash at their village. The schools in the village have access to technology that other citizens wouldn't even dream of. They compete over everything from the health of their citizens to the height of their flagpole. Only a few hundred people live in each village and the weird thing is, they aren't even really aware of the oddity of their situation. They are rural farmers mostly and have never traveled very far from their respective homes. During the height of the cold war, any furrow(accidental or otherwise)into the DMZ was met with armed confrontation and sometimes imprisonment. The new generation of DMZ villagers have grown up surrounded by barbed wire and have not experienced the tensions often associated with the cold war. Malaria has become an issue because the wildness of the area has provided a perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes. The citizens must abide by strict rules which include a curfew of 11 pm. They must carry special ID's to gain admittance to their neighbourhood. Every few years someone is maimed or killed by accidentally stepping on a landmine. And yet, the overall population of the village of Daeseong has dropped by only a few people since 1955. The villagers are given special privileges such as provincial tax exemption and release from mandatory military service.   I thought the whole concept was really interesting...I am surprised that people choose to remain there and yet at the same time, I am not. They have reached their goal...they are model citizens.  There was a big protest last week in Seoul...with riot police and everything. Two weeks ago Korea took in it's largest number of North Korean refugees in history. You would think I read about it in the Korean Herald, wouldn't you? I didn't. I read about both in the Globe and Mail online edition. JC.

      Tonight when we were walking home we met a  urlLink group of kids . They were out playing in the park...it was a beautiful summer evening. Everywhere we go here we see children. They play on the streets, they take taxis downtown. It's not that they are neglected or mistreated, that is just the way it is. The kids came up and started talking to us...the typical giggles and mumbled Hello's. Some of them were quite good at English and could carry on a conversation. They are always pleased to hear we are from Canada. One young boy spoke no English at all but his ability to mimic was unbelievable. After hearing an English word only a couple of times he could rattle it off as though he had been speaking it all of his life. They were all very cute. We took some pictures with them and they had a blast looking at themselves on the LCD viewfinder. We had a blast too.  The other day I was walking down the street and two young girls were sitting on a bench on the side of the road. They were watching me (not at all unusual around here...I am tall, white and I have red hair. It's a no brainer really.) As I walked by, one of the girls yelled "I love you!" to which I responded "I love you too." They erupted in fits of giggles. I don't really understand it but that's okay. It made me smile.

      I feel like I am facing one of those big life decisions and I have been flip-flopping between two options for the last year or so. A part of me wants to travel and live an independent existence...my pen as my sword and all that jazz. I want to tell people's stories from around the globe. I want to eventually work for an international aid organization like Unicef and then the United Nations. I want to live in Australia and in Moscow and in Rome. I want to write books and take amazing photographs. The other part of me wants to be a Mom and have a nice life where the Globe arrives on my doorstep on Saturday morning and I meet my friends for coffee on Sundays. In that life I am working as a communications consultant (or something equally corporate) and I volunteer with the local shelter on weekends. I cook and I have a beautiful garden. I go on nice vacations and I have a wonderful family and at the end of the day I feel lucky but a little bored. At the same time, I know that I tend to romanticize the "Amazonian woman journalist" lifestyle and that I would often feel alone and empty. Or would I? Comfortable mediocrity or lonely ambition? This is the question that I find myself struggling with more than anything else. That and how the hell George Bush is the President of the Free World.

      Happy Birthday Craig! I miss you kiddo.   I feel like all I do is work. I get up and and get ready for work. Then I go to work. Then I come home (exhausted) and go to bed so I can get up in time for work. It's not really a bad thing though. After living an unscheduled existence for so long, it's really nice to know what every day will look like. It's refreshing in it's predictability. I guess that's what makes monks become monks. Today I will sit in a cave and eat rice. I will chant and I will meditate and I will sleep. And then I will do it another 29,200 times before I die.   Every day I teach roughly 90 kids. They range in age from about five to 13 or 14. I teach some classes Monday, Wednesday and Friday and other classes on Tuesday and Thursday. I have one class, my preschool class, who I teach everyday. For obvious reasons they are my favorite. They are Hans, Brian, Hoya, Mark and Leo. Hans looks like a mini-Korean version of Don Johnson (circa Miami Vice) with spiked hair and a single gold hoop in his ear. Keep in mind this kid is five. Hoya looks Hawaiian for some reason and is the youngest. Let's just say she's not the smallest or the brightest. She just looks at you with these vacant eyes and every time you ask her a question she responds with "ugly duckling". Apparently that book really influenced her life. Brian is the little joker and he wears a tie everyday. Over his t-shirt. He does this little dance where he sticks out his tongue and wiggles his bum. It's hilarious. Mark is the goody-two shoes and Leo is the nice, sweet kid. They are great.  So I discovered something about myself the other day that came as quite a shock because it goes against everything I  thought  I knew about myself. I am not a dreamer. I'm a dreamer in many senses of the word but in this particular way I am not. Brian always says things like "Have you ever thought what it would be like to be a rock star/in the NBA/a millionaire"? The answer is usually no. If I imagine doing something I then proceed to figure out what I need to do to accomplish said dream. I have never dreamt of being something, realized it wouldn't happen and then kept on going. (Okay, a couple of times when I was younger I imagined what it would be like to have no legs and so I dragged myself around the house for a whole day, but that's a different kind of dream isn't?) Brian said it was sad. I felt shocked that at 26 I could be confronted with something so   novel   about myself. Is it sad? I don't know. I think about what it would be like to be a scientist so I do it. I imagined being a journalist so I did it. I have imagined being a doctor and I didn't do it so I consider myself a failure in that regard. I am not a successful journalism grad...I am a failed egyptologist, a failed simian research specialist, a failed actress and doctor and teacher (oh wait -I am doing that now) and a failed politician. Sheesh. What am I going to do about this exactly?

      I am sitting here drinking an iced coffee. Koreans apparently  love  iced coffee...it's everywhere. It usually comes in little cans and it's quite good. The other day I decided to get one and I opened the cute little fridge I had seen at the corner store everyday...only to find out that the fridge wasn't a fridge. It was a heater! The iced coffees were hot! In a way (a Korean way) this makes sense. You put the can in the fridge - it's cold coffee. You put the same can in a heater? It's hot coffee. Merely another example of Korean ingenuity.   Our friend Eileen got back from Hong Kong yesterday and her legs are covered in bandages. She got such a bad sunburn that she had to bandaged from her toes to her knees...poor thing. She is as white as can be (she is whiter than me even!) and she apparently was only in the sun for half an hour. Yikes. Other than that she though Hong Kong was fantastic. I want to go there...and I want to go to Vietnam, North Korea, Bali, Cambodia, China, Japan, Russia, Mongolia, Guam...any way, you get the idea.   I got my first copy of the  urlLink Korean Herald  yesterday! Yipppeee! It was like Christmas for me. It's not a bad newspaper and it's interesting to read about things going on in Korea and how they perceive international politics. Yesterday there was an article by a professor about America. It was the biggest load of hogwash I have ever read (and I have read a lot of hogwash by the so-called liberal media..ahem, anyway). In it, the man laments the state of Korea and uses the elevators of America and Seoul as an example of contrast. According to him the "hold Open" buttons in America are worn down they have been pushed so much. And in Seoul? The "close doors" buttons of course. He claims that Koreans will slam people in the closing elevator doors rather than be late while Americans will patiently and obsessively open the doors for all those who seek entrance. Puh-lease.   Here is something interesting for my j-school buddies out there (and for other like-minded folk). Remember the South Korean who was beheaded my the Islamic militants? Of course you do. So, they are holding a commission into his death in Seoul and lo and behold if some interesting things have emerged. Apparently, the Associated Press received a 13-minute video showing the man in captivity. They neither informed the Korean government or the man's employer. They sat on it. The first time the government knew the man was being held was the day before he was killed (or so they claim) and when they got wind of the fact that AP had an earlier tape they requested it. What the received was a 4-minute edited version. Strange? You bet.

      We actually left the house today! I know, that's kind of pathetic, but we have both been feeling so crappy. Today we went to the Deagu Tourist Information Centre which is situated in  urlLink Duryu Park . The park is huge and is really beautiful...it's the Central Park of Daegu(well not really...Central Park is pretty awesome but you get the idea.)  We walked around the park and watched all of the families who were having  urlLink picnics  under the trees. It's really neat here - people seem to have the time to just sit and relax. A lot of people were  urlLink playing Checkers  or different card games. The kids were on rollerblades and the old people fanned themselves or slept on their picnic blankets. The picnic blankets incidentally are all identical and made of silver material. I am assuming they are designed to reflect the sunlight? Anyway, it was very peaceful and a beautiful day to be outside.   The information centre wasn't really all that helpful but they did give us free postcards of Daegu. We bumped into a couple from California last week downtown and they told us to ask for the postcards at the Info. Centre. Apparently they only hand them out to Whities and only upon request. Once again, talking to random people pays off.  Speaking of random people...  So Brian and I went walking tonight in the park and eventually ended up in an area a little more, how shall I say? Korean, than other areas of the park. I had flashbacks of stumbling into a shanty town near Kasane in Botswana. I love those kinds of situations because it offers such a good picture of real life in the country you are visiting. The effect your attitude has on the people around you is amplified in situations like these...such a good experience. Anyway, there was music playing and so we decided to follow it. We came across a group of local elderly people dancing to music being played on the back of a parked motorbike. We stood and watched for awhile before we joined in. It was so great. I  urlLink danced  with the group, which got larger and larger the longer we were there, and Brian took pictures and chatted with the men. They gave us some Soju (more on that in the next paragraph)and gave Brian some dried fish. We  urlLink danced  and laughed and we all really enjoyed ourselves. It was a great time...I was sweating like crazy by the time we left. Dad if you were there, we probably wouldn't  ever  have left!!   urlLink Soju . Ahhh...Korea's national beverage. It's made of fermented sweet potatoes and tastes like a mixture of vodka and formaldehyde. But heck, if you can drink Jagermeister, you can drink Soju. The funny thing is that it's sold in bottles like beer but it's just over 25% alcohol. It's cheap and everyone drinks it. We have been warned of the effects of Soju but have yet to encounter them ourselves...all in good time. Heh, heh.  This country has the best popsicles I have ever had. They are only 50 cents and they are delicious! I should know because I have been living on nothing but for the past three days. Who knew? Korea: undiscovered oasis of all things popsicle-y.  The Korean currency is the Won and it's worth about a tenth of a cent. So 1,000 won is about one dollar Canadian. Here is the weird thing though - their highest bill is a  urlLink 10,000 note . That means that if you want to carry 200$ around you need at least 20 bills. Does that make any sense?
