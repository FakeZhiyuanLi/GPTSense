						   I once dated this boy named Erik.  Erik was a writer, who lived an interesting life as a taxi cab dispatcher at the age of 22.  We met in a creative writing class and I fancied him from the beginning because of his very strong, striking Scandinavian looks.  It was unusual for me to be attracted to him because I usually go for the physical opposite of myself... olive complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, long lovely noses.  We occasionally talked in class, and I was very much impressed by his writing.  It is a rare thing for me to be impressed.  I am always humbled by the knowledge that someone is greater at something than me.  One day after class, he slipped a note into my palm that said, "You are very beautiful," followed by his phone number.  Of course I was compelled to call him...   On our first date we just drove around a lot.  He asked me where my favourite place was and I told him I loved Palo Alto.  He drove me there.  We sat, had coffee, talked. The drove some more.  He liked to take pictures from his vehicle of people on the side of the road who were waiting... waiting for the bus... talking on payphones... and so on.  Once we got back to the parking garage where I was parked, he asked if he could kiss me.  I believe my response was "ummmmm" and so he went ahead and kissed me.... very passionately I might add.    He had been homeless for a few years, before I met him, after having had a falling out with his parents.  He lived in an abandoned building and in various places all over downtown San Jose and drank and did drugs... the usual stuff I guess.  Finally I guess he reconciled with his parents and moved back in.  His writing was filled with stories from the streets and of hardships that he endured (mostly self-inflicted, but I don't think he saw it that way).    He was truly a beautiful individual though.   He was so tender and respectful...  he would spend the very little income he had on flowers for me, despite my protestations... he always told me how beautiful I was and was always always considerate of my boundaries.    There came a time though, when I realized that he was very needy and emotionally unbalanced.  He struggled with depression, especially during the winter (which was when we met), and had a lot of anxiety.  He told me once that he worried about me all the time.  That I would be taken from him... but it wasn't like normal anxiety.  It was very specific.. he would imagine the worst thing that could happen, like he would worry that I would be driving and be blinded by the glare off someone's' rear windscreen and crash.  Or that it would be raining and I'd be driving and spin out.. or weird things like that.  He would never make unprotected left turns... even out of parking lots.  He would go out of his way to make right turns only because they were safer.  He called me way too often to tell me about a new type of orange he found, or to tell me little tiny things.  I think at first this appealed to me, but after about a month I began to feel stifled.  I didn't want to have to tell someone every little minute detail of my life.  He would almost cry at the thought of me leaving or being unhappy with him.  It was not a good position for either of us to be in, so I decided to end it and try to be friends (as all girls do).    That ended up badly.  It was basically like dating without the offical decree of monogamy (even though both of us were, the fact that it wasn't official allowed for there to be more jealousies and insecurities than with a real boyfriend/girlfriend type relationship).  I tried to explain to him how I felt about him and his problems... why it wouldn't work, but he was beyond reason.  One day he said, "I have this J.D. Salinger book of short stories, and there's one that I think you should read..." and then he said that it made him think of me or he thought I'd like it or something like that.... SO it ends up being this story of "Esme" a very bright, well-spoken child, who meets and talks to this war-torn veteran.  She speaks to him as though she understands the ravages of war and approaches everything from an intellectual perspective.  But the story is basically pointing out how naive she is, and how one can never understand fully the pain and suffering of another.    I was so upset!  This was the way he saw me?  How dare he insinuate that I had no understanding of real pain?  Obviously I had never been homeless or ummm emotionally disturbed, but please... he had two very much alive, caring, financially sound parents who supported him entirely and he, out of rebellion had left home, become homeless, abused drugs, etc.  I, on the otherhand, had lost my father at the age of 12, had 2 younger brothers, and a mother who had to support us after his death.  His claim was only justified in the fact that no, I in fact had never gone through what he had gone through, and I wanted to say "NO! Nor have you been through what I've been through.  How dare you!"  And maybe I did say that, but anyhow, I gave that book back to him and never wanted to read Salinger again.    (sidenote:  there was a passage at the end were the soldier says something like "at least i have my F-F-F-F-A-C-U-L-T-I-E-S", and my friend Jimmy and i of course use this line to mockingly reference Erik and his neuroses).  sorry, that was a long wank of a blog about things that are of no interest to anyone...

						   well i'm reading Anais Nin's diaries, and i found this great quote on love that i thought i'd share.  This was what she said to counter her friend's statement that relationships were "always the same"  (because he did not love, but merely had sex).  "For love it is never the same.  What goes on inside is  never the same, just like this music which changes every instant.  For love there are a million variations, a million nights, a million days, contrasts in moods, in textures, whims, a million gestures coloured by emotion, by sorrow, joy, fear, courage, triumph, by revelations which deepen the groove, creations which expand its dimensions, sharpen its penetrations.  Love is vast enough to include a phrase read in a book, the shape of a neck seen and desired in a crowd, a face loved and desired, seen in the window of a passing subway, vast enough to include a past love, a future love, a film, a voyage, a scene in a dream, an hallucination, a vision. Love-making on a winter night is different from love-making on a summer night, under a tent, or under a tree, with or without a cover, under a shower, in darkness or in light, in heat or cold."  p.111   The Diary of Anais Nin, Volume 3

						   today i wore two different shoes to work.  now i will just say that i work at the most stylish and posh little store in LA (very recognizable).  anyhow, i didn't notice that my flip flops were 2 different colours until i was taking my lunch break at about 2:30.  not only were my shoes 2 different colours, but the straps were different materials... one has an arch support where the other does not...  it is very unlike me to not notice these things visually, let alone sensually.   my point is that i am going slowly, yet progressively mad!  i didn't think that a person did these things when they were 24.  i thought that it happened to 45 year-olds who dress in the dark to go to their desk jobs at the crack of dawn.  i mean, for pete's sake, i put my shoes on at 9:00 AM!   i wonder how common this is for people my age.  i think i'm especially aware of it because i've always been such a "together" sort of person.  so even this slow aging is noticable to me, and it's upseting because i know there's nothing i can do about it except try to focus especially hard on whatever it is i'm doing or whatever i may be talking about.

						   I’ve always felt like my mother didn’t really worry about me. I always thought that it was because I was such a good girl that she never felt a need to worry. But now I think (knowing my mom better and understanding her weaknesses more than ever now that I am getting older) that it is because she shields herself from all manner of pain. She’s gone through a lot of pain in her life, and I think that her coping mechanism has always been to ignore the threat of pain or danger or insecurity because then it wouldn’t exist… Throughout my life (since I was about 15 really), I’ve struggled with depression off and on. During that time, she was never able to acknowledge the idea that I could be so despondant.  The idea that I would consider suicide was too much for her to bear, so she would simply not allow herself to consider the possibility at all. She rejected the notion that my depression was actually a mental condition at all, but decided that it was a spiritual condition and that it could be relieved by prayer and by otherwise ignoring it.  When later on in my life, I told her that I was so distressed that I thought often of death, she seemed calmly surprised. “Why didn’t you tell me?” she asked. I told her that I thought that she knew because I was depressed and that when depression lasts that long, the two go hand in hand. The idea of this almost seemed to shock her and make her uncomfortable… it was merely because has never allowed herself to dwell on any of her problems or on the idea that there may not be a reason for a lot of the things we do… a reason for life really.  She completely involves herself in the church and in church activities… maybe not to intentionally numb herself, but to keep busy enough that she does not have to think about these things. She has always busied herself in this way. I have a feeling that even before she was a devout Christian she was busy and as social as she is now. She’s told me often that she’s never liked being alone. She always wanted to have a roommate.  I think that is why we have a hard time relating…she can’t understand how I feel, and I am frustrated that she won’t allow herself to be introspective enough to understand the pain of others. She is aware of the pain in the world only visually... not because of her own experience with it.  When my father died, I'm sure that was enough pain for her and I know that in her past she's experienced some very rough things, but she never really  dealt  with them persay. I know because one time when I was confrontational with her, she told me. She explained that it was just easier to not think about painful things, and to not deal with them. I wonder what will happen to her when she has to confront these accumulated things.... maybe she will short-circuit like a robot. Smoke will stream from her ears and her head will flop to the side, eyes wide open and blank.
