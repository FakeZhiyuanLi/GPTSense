      Well it looks like I won't get through all the books I had planned for July. I got a bit too busy with weekend trips and redecorating projects at the house.  The 'Icewind Dale Trilogy' will have to wait until August and it looks like "The Jane Austen Book Club" might be put off indefinitely. I just can't get motivated about this book and I've had one too many friends tell me that it was an absolutely boring read!   urlLink Le Mariage  by Diane Johnson  Because I enjoyed Johnson's previous book 'Le Divorce' so much, I assumed that I'd find this one at least amusing - not so. While I enjoyed the glimpse of Americans living in France, the surrounding story and attempt at a suspenseful plot did nothing for me. Murder, Ancient Manuscript Theft, Love Affairs - this book could have been so promising, yet the storyline never delivered. Save yourself some time and read 'Le Divorce' instead (although don't rent the movie, even Kate Hudson couldn't save that one!)    urlLink Morality for Beautiful Girls  (Book #3 in the No.1 Ladies Detective Agency series) by Alexander McCall Smith  The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency books never disappoint! The third book in the series focuses on the relationship between Mma Ramotswe (if anyone knows the pronunciation of Mma I'd love to know!) and Mr J.L.B. Matekoni. It's full of the colorful characters, conversations, and unusual going ons of daily Botswana life that I so thoroughly enjoy.    urlLink The Jane Austen Book Club  by Karen J Fowler  I'm glad I ran out of time and didn't get a chance to read this book, after hearing my bookclub's review it's definitely not on my must read list any longer.   "A sublime comedy of contemporary manners, this is the novel Jane Austen might well have written had she lived in twenty-first- century California.  Six Californians join to discuss Jane Austen's novels. Over the six months they meet, marriages are tested, affairs begin, unsuitable arrangements become suitable, and love happens. With her finely sighted eye for the frailties of human behavior and her finely tuned ear for the absurdities of social intercourse, Fowler has never been wittier nor her characters more appealing. The result is a delicious dissection of modern relationships."  - Book Description

      A few weekends ago I set out on my first backpacking trip in over 10 years.  This was a real, carry everything you need for 3 days on your back, backpacking trip.  There were 4 of us in total, my husband, brother, and a good friend from college.  The group was supposed to be much larger but various illnesses, work issues, and sheer laziness cut the number down to 4.  We arrived in the vicinity of the Dilling Road trail-head ( urlLink Segment A  of the North Country Trail) late Friday afternoon.  After an hour long search for the actual trail-head (note to self, bring more detailed county maps for the next trip) we finally parked the cars and headed off.   Update from a friendly visitor: There's not really a trail head at Dilling Road, it's basically just a point where the trail crosses the road.  Keep an eye out for North Country Trail (NCT) markers on either side of the road.  If you look close, you'll spot them.      We had to hike close to 7 miles that evening to meet up with my brother at the Red Bridge trail-head.  We pushed ourselves hard to get to the second trailhead (and the start of the  urlLink Manistee River Trail ) before nightfall.  We arrived at the road at dusk and hiked in 1/2 mile or so to a suitable campsite.  We ended up setting up camp in the dark and the search for dry firewood began.    Finally we had a small campfire going, our tents pitched, hammock slung, and it was time for dinner.  A steak packed in by my brother provided a hearty meal for my husband.  Only problem is he stole the fire to cook on the coals.  So long campfire.  After dinner and cleaning the dishes I was ready for bed.  I turned in while the boys sat around the fire and drank.  Extra food and necessities were left at home or in the car due to weight, yet 2 fifths of jack somehow made the cut.  I didn't sleep well that night, the $6 foam pad under my sleeping bag didn't offer any protection from the hard ground.  The entire night my hips were digging into the ground.  Next morning after a breakfast of oatmeal and gatoraid we set out.  Our aim was to complete the Manistee River Trail in one day.  Total length of the Trail is 10.5 miles and we figured that would be a doable distance considering we had completed 7 miles the night before in less than 4 hours.  That would leave us with another 10 mile hike Sunday along Segment A of the North Country Trail.  A long hike for the third day, but necessary to return us to the parking lot.  One hour and less than 2 miles into the Manistee River Trail we stopped to reevaluate our goals.  The packs seemed heavier and were rubbing harder than they had the day before.  The terrain was no hillier, but perhaps looming nightfall and the need to meet up with my brother had pushed us on.  We decided to hike another 3 or so miles further on the Manistee River Trail, set up camp and enjoy the day, and then return along the same path the next morning.  This ended up working out perfectly.  Along this stretch of the Manistee River Trail we also got a chance to try out our newly acquired Katadyn water filter.  There were several small bridge covered streams that fed into the Manistee which provided the perfect spot to filter water.     Filtering the water was a lot easier and a lot better tasting than I ever thought it would be.  It certainly helped that we were using a clean and fast moving water source.  In less than 5 minutes we were able to fill 4 Nalgene bottles, a 1 quart storage bottle, and a few miscellaneous canteens.     We hiked two hours or so until we found a suitable campsite.  This time we were right alongside the river instead of on a bluff overlooking it.  We set-up camp and took a refreshing dip in the river (the very cold river).  Clean and exhausted we settled in for what was to be a short nap.  Two hours later we awoke and began preparing for dinner.  We spent a few hours around the fire as the night sky crept in.  It really is amazing the amount of stars you can see outside the city.  The sky was alive with white dots, I think I even saw the Milky Way.  The strange thing was that there was no moon, not that night or the one before.    The next morning we loaded up and headed back the way we came.  We settled on a leisurely pace knowing that we didn't have far to go to get back to the car.  About 20 minutes before we reached the car it began to rain.  It was a light rain and the trees did a good job of catching the majority of the drops.  This was a good thing because putting on rain gear that doesn't breathe in 80 degree weather is not my idea of fun.  We arrived back at the car exhausted and sore.  Although I felt strangely refreshed and alive.  We've promised ourselves that we'll plan another trip soon, maybe this time with a little more planning we can cover more ground.  I definitely want to do more of this backpacking thing.

      I need to figure out how to edit this template so that it takes up more of the page.  Read an interesting  urlLink article  last week that said 800x600 has been ousted as the most popular resolution on the web.  It's been replaced by 1024x768.   About time.  800x600 looks like a preschooler's PC to me.

      I feel alive when I read. Some girls love shoes, I love books (okay I love shoes too).  Each new book holds the promise of a new memory, a new experience.  Books touch me in a way that no other media can.  I can travel the universe inside my head -- and what a strange and wonderful journey it can be.  Some say why read when you can get out and do, I say why not read on your way to the doing.  What I love almost as much as reading is being able to share the books I read with others.  So without further ado I give you my June reading list.  Feel free to leave comments or suggestions.    urlLink The Dark Elf Trilogy  This is one of those books that I can't imagine living my life without having read.  It didn't change my life or teach me how to be a better person, instead it created such a vivid world in my head that I felt as if I had lived life alongside the main characters.  Their struggles were my struggles, their fears my fears, their happiness my happiness.  Not since "Lord of the Rings" have I felt so utterly immersed in a storyline.    Speaking of "Lord of the Rings" I've heard a lot of people compare the two trilogies.  I'm kind of on the fence as to whether or not that's a good comparison.  I can understand why some people may find them similar, both are epic, sweeping tales that span generations and share the underlying theme of good versus evil, but to me that's where the similarities end.  The characters are written differently, developed differently.     Another reason I'm so in love with this book is that it is just the first (chronologically) of many in what I call the Dark Elf Series.  I just ordered the next two trilogies in the series and can't wait to begin reading them.   Do yourself a favor and give this book a chance.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how wonderful it really is.    urlLink Under the Tuscan Sun  I honestly didn't expect to enjoy this book that much, not even sure why I got it.  It was one of those books that you add to your wishlist and forget about until someone gives it to you as a gift.    I read this book mostly while I was at the hospital visiting my mother-in-law.  We spent long nights at the hospital and this book helped to pass the time.  I can still smell the hospital when I think of this book.  Crammed in a small couch in the corner of the room, barely enough light to make out the words on the page.  It's a good book, full of Tuscan imagery and history.  Definitely a worthy read, not the best I've read but no book is ever a waste.  I learned a lot about life in another country, small hints at what my life may have been like if my ancestors had never boarded the Mayflower.      urlLink The Bookseller of Kabul  A glimpse into the life of an Afghan family seemed timely.  With everything going on in the world I hoped to gain a better understanding of life in Afghanistan both pre and post Taliban.  Some parts, especially about life as a woman, make me so mad that I want to put the book down and never read it again.  I find it amazing how strong these Afghan women really are.  Some may see weakness, I see only courage.  They posses more strength than any Western woman who has been handed her rights on a silver platter.  Even with the everyday barriers that are placed in their way, they manage to persevere with grace and acceptance.    urlLink Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  Fun read.  Made the smart move of reading the book before seeing the movie.  Never was able to get through the first two books after seeing the movies.  Too similar I suppose.

      Maybe I'm just getting old, but when did TV become so mindless.  If I see one more advertisement for a reality show...  Am I really that out of touch with mainstream America?  Does everyone else out there besides me just love all these shows?  I mean who is watching them?  Everyone I talk to is sick of them, but they must get ratings and to get ratings there have to be viewers.  I'm convinced that the Nielsen Rating boxes that are randomly sent to households throughout America have all collected in a midwestern trailer park (I'm from the midwest, I can say that).  Where Jerry Springer and Reality Shows are more coveted than the Super Bowl.  The one shining star I've found in this summers line-up are the re-runs of "Sex and the City" on TBS, but that's a rare weekly treat.  The rest of the week I fill the void left by TV with books.  Any kind of book I can get my hands on.   No genre is off limits (except those cheesy romance novels, I just can't take a book with a picture of Fabio on the cover seriously)  And speaking of Fabio, does anyone remember the finale of "Average Joe 2 - Hawaii"?  Who breaks up with someone because they dated Fabio, then again, who dates Fabio.  I think I just answered the question of who watches these shows...

      Some days there are just too many disconnected thoughts floating between my ears.  I feel as if I may loose some important tidbit of information unless I write them down.  I'm all about lists, a wishlist for books I want to read, a list of places I want to see in my life, a grocery list.  This blog is my laundry list of lists.  I feel an innate need to share my thoughts with others.  To somehow validate and record my ideas on the off chance that there is someone out there who can find a use for them.   This blog is my way of appeasing the voices in my head.  The voices whose life's goal is to be shared with others.

       urlLink The Pillars of the Earth  by Ken Follett  I'm only a few chapters into this book but already I'm loving it. Reminds me very much of "Pope Joan" which is one of my all time favorite novels.  Word to the wise though, if you're going to purchase this book, spend a few extra bucks and get the hard cover. The softcover is one of those short and thick "beach" novels that aren't very comfortable to read!   Update: I can't put this book down! I'm completely engrossed in the story, I honestly feel as if I'm watching a wonderful movie in my head!   " As a new age dawns in England's twelfth century, the building of a mighty Gothic cathedral sets the stage for a story of intrigue and power, revenge and betrayal. " - Book Description    urlLink Icewind Dale Trilogy  by R. A. Salvatore  I might never get to read this book! I made the mistake of introducing my husband to the Dark Elf books, and while I was suffering through 'Le Mariage' he was thoroughly enjoying 'The Dark Elf Trilogy'. Now he's reading 'Icewind Dale Trilogy' so I have to wait until he finishes before I can begin. And with over 1500 pages, that could be awhile... Oh well, it's worth it to have turned another person on to this series.  " Icewind Dale. Windswept passes and forbidding glaciers stand at the top of the world. Below them, in the cold valleys, an evil force broods: the magic of Crenshinibon, the crystal shard.       Now dwarf, barbarian, and drow elf join to battle this evil. Tempered in the furnace of struggle, they form an unbreakable friendship.       A legend is born. " - Book Description    urlLink The Descent  by Jeff Long  This is our bookclub selection for the month of August. I'm definitely excited to read this book, sounds right up my alley!  " Long's smart and epic tale takes the reader into a Dantesque world, a journey to the center of the earth for the new millennium. And what is found there is both horrific and entrancing: a system of tunnels that network beneath the earth, and homonid relatives of Homo sapiens evolved to live in the depths of what appears to be hell. " - Baltimore Sun    urlLink Legacy of the Drow  by R. A. Salvatore  " The Legacy of the Drow Collector's Edition brings together four bestselling novels: The Legacy, Starless Night, Siege of Darkness, and Passage to Dawn. The adventure begins in seeming serenity as we find Drizzt Do'Urden enjoying a rare state of peace. But he did not arrive at this station without leaving powerful enemies in his wake. Lolth, the dreaded Spider Queen deity of the evil Dark Elves, counts herself among these enemies and has vowed to end the drow's idyllic days. Thus begins a severe and lasting chain of events that make these collected Forgotten Realms novels unforgettable reads. " - Book Description

      I just finsihed making a poster for our cat Sprocket. We have two cats and since they're both alpha females they don't get a long at all. So my husband has decided that Sprocket must go. I understand his reasons but I'm still very very sad! So if anyone is looking for a cat, let me know!

      I recently joined a book club that a friend from college started. This is my first time participating in a book club and I'm really looking forward to it. As I've always said the only thing better than reading a good book is sharing that book with others.  This post will be updated monthly with the latest book our club is reading.    August 2004    urlLink The Descent  by Jeff Long  I was pleasantly surprised to learn that several members of the book club are actually closet sci-fi fans. I was a bit worried we'd be reading mostly autobiographies and literary classics each month. Not that I'd complain, I have several that match that description on my wishlist, but it's nice to be able to spice things up a bit with sci-fi and fantasy.    July 2004      urlLink The Jane Austen Book  Club by Karen Joy Fowler  This book didn't go over so well with the book club members. I ran out of time and was unable to read the book but decided to still attend the monthly meeting (after all, book clubs really are just another reason to socialize!)  Most of the members were left wondering why the book had received such high critical acclaim and praise. I'm definitely not sorry I missed this one.

      I'm so depressed...  My husband and I have been planning a trip to Northern California for most of the year. Now I find out that due to his new job (he's an agency employee so doesn't have much say so in his job) we might have to cancel the trip. Granted we've only paid for airfare, but we got such a wonderful deal I'd hate to see it go to waste. It's supposed to be our 1 year anniversary trip and dreaming of driving along the coast has been getting me through some of the tougher days at work.  I know it's not his fault, but I'm am just so disappointed, I just can't believe that work could get in the way of a planned trip. I guess I take for granted working someplace where vacations and personal time are respected. I should feel lucky for that, but all I can feel right now is disappointment.
