      The  urlLink OQO , the small device that might look like a small Sharp Wizard or a PalmPilot with a keyboard, is starting to  urlLink make a splash  in the electronics world. As I wrote about earlier this month (May 12), the OQO is a device which fits in your pocket but runs full-on Windows XP.    Prediction : Devices of this size and capability are going to make a big impact to geekhead and businesspeople alike. Why buy a Palm or PocketPC device which has a watered-down operating system when you can bring the full Windows OS with you? Go on vacation, go to the coffee shop, whatever. Other device makers are also going in this direction as I mentioned on  urlLink May 25 . What could make this prediction fail? If the makes themselves price these things too high. Ideally they should be in the $500-1000 range, but I predict they'll be higher. Most people won't buy in at that point.   At any rate, this is good news for those of us who like our data to go.

      People still looking for gmail invites.  urlLink www.gmailswap.com  is nice but offers not much help since it's deluged by people asking for invites. Google's  urlLink own blog  doesn't give any insight at all (and I would think this would be prime material for a blog). A  urlLink site in the UK  which hosts discussions on all things Google is saying that  urlLink Blogger  users are getting a new round of invites. No confirmation though. And they do point out the vast number of people signing up for Blogger and then creating empty blogs -- not too attractive real estate for our internet neighborhood.    So, meanwhile, the [virtual] world waits and waits for the elusive invitation, or the day when the doors open and it's a real party.

      OK, so now I'm really getting upset. I really want to get my hands on Google's  urlLink gmail . I had read that the users of Blogger were getting first dibs as part of the beta testing (blogger being owned by Google -- makes sense). So, I had a Blogger account that rarely got used, and I started using it, hoping to get the elusive and much sought after invitation. No go. So, I figured (and read someplace else) that it must be for the very active Blogger users who post often.  So I was bummed, but at least I thought I had the answer. I continue to use Blogger in the hopes that sometime soon I'll achieve a significant number of posts to warrant an invitation and also because the service is pretty cool and I'm considering this time my own "blogger beta testing".  Now, however, I read  urlLink this post  that another guy was in the same situation as me, with a dormant Blogger account that he started using, and he actually got the gmail invitation. Right away.  Seething. Anger. Bah.

      Well, after much searching through the internet, I've come up with a timeline on when Google's Gmail might be available to the public. You know by this point, after all the posts I've made and the interest I've taken in it, that I'd like to get an account. My revisionbar.com account isn't that great of a client, and although it does support POP3, downloading messages directly to my PC has introduced viruses more than once. So, it seems as if a webmail solution is my best bet, at least until the spam situation dies down (if ever). Enter Gmail, from Google. I'd love to get it, but so far I've only found 2 references as to when it might be available to the whole world. 90 days from it's invitation-only start (that would put it at the end of June) and an article that states "late summer" (--> urlLink go to article ) This makes me unhappy. I really don't want to wait that long. [sigh].

      Rumors are swirling about  urlLink Dell possibly wanting to acquire PalmOne , the arm of Palm that makes the hardware devices. While Palm's (and PalmOne's) future has been in question for some time as a result of lackluster sales and devices that were bourgeois at best, those times had appeared to be over. The reviews of the entire  urlLink Tungsten  line, along with the record-setting sales of it's  urlLink Zire  line, have been key elements in PalmOne's recovery. In effect, most fans had thought the worst had passed.   So, then, the question: why a buyout now? And can PalmOne effectively hold the dealmakers at the door and say "No thanks"?

      Well, Gmail fever has struck. People want to get their hands on 1GB of email storage space so bad that at least one person who has an inivitation from Google to sign up has decided to auction it off.

       I'm still looking around for a new email service. I may actually have to wait until  urlLink Google's Gmail  is released to the public. After everything I've read, I think that's the service I want to use. I at least want to give it a try. After all, they're giving their users a  urlLink full terabyte  of space now (up from the staggering 1GB which they started out with)but it's still debatable whether that limit will stay. 1GB is more than enough anyway.  I was hoping that since I'm using blogger now, google would offer me the  chance to sign up for Gmail. That's what was reported by many blogger users, but so far no window has popped up which offers this. Maybe it will happen later, or maybe I'll just sign up when the floodgates open.

      Lots of you may be wondering what this is all about. A whole new format, audio links... what is up ?  Well, here's the story. I'm experimenting with a new format and new content delivering system for the revision bar. Currently, and historically, I have hand-coded the files (which I love, by the way) and manually FTP-ed the files over to the server. However, with the hand coding and manual manipulation of the server came certain restrictions. For instance, I would like to implement a "talkback" system where users, that is--ANY user, with or without permission, could send comments about something I've written and have it posted to the site. That proved harder than I thought, and so I started looking around.  urlLink Blogger  provides that functionality and much more. Check it out:     The ability to post from any PC via a web browser.  No files need to be on the PC your'e sitting at because they're all on the blogger server  The ability to post from a handheld device (Palm, PocketPC, etc)  The ability to send an email, with an included blog entry, directly to your site and have it posted.  The ability to post from a cellular phone. The entries get saved as .MP3 files and your site visitors can listen to your audio posts. There's one on this site right now.   Automatic archiving of content. After a month, all the content goes from the front page to an archive section to make room for the newer stuff. Automatically. Very cool.       So, the bottom line is I'm trying this format out, and I encourage you to also. If it all works out well, I may switch to using this and have the full Revision Bar run this way instead of just a subset as it is now.  For now though, I encourage you to browse the page, check out some of the links, and definitely try the  Comments  section. It's the  one feature I'm the most pumped about, because it could give me good feedback about who's reading this site. If people comment, I can begin to get a feel for who my readers are and what they'd like to see. We can also get that whole community thing going, which I think is essential to a good site.   Enjoy it, and let me know what you think.

      I just checked another of my Yahoo accounts, interestingly enough not to see if the space limit had been put it into effect, but to actually check my inbox. To my surprise, I now have 100 MB and a newer interface. Awesome. However, for some reason, my other Yahoo account, which is much older (opened somewhere around 1997), has NOT gotten the space increase yet. My guess is that either 1) they hate me and want my account to remain grandfathered in at a smaller MB limit or 2)that they're gradually making the change to all the accounts and just haven't gotten to my other account yet.  I choose to think that it's option number 1.   For all you  urlLink Yahoo Mail  users, go check out your inbox and see what's up. There may be a big surprise waiting for you.

      In my quest for a better email provider, I decided yesterday to try  urlLink spymac . What a waste. I had read on forums that the service wasn't great, was slow, etc, but you never know what ax these people have to grind when they make such comments. So, I signed up. Pretty much a mistake. What I'm left with now is an account that I'll probably never use and will hopefully get deleted after a period of inactivity. It's just that the service is slow, and the interface is pretty bare bones and not attractive to use at all. It doesn't seem to support much, if any, HTML mail, and you certainly can't compose an HTML mail. It's just painful to use. So I won't.   An interesting side note is that  urlLink Yahoo Mail  is looking better and better as I compare it to all the others. Although I predict gmail will still be better overall, Yahoo's combination of a real decent spam filter and support for HTML messages really make it shine. It's actually quite fast too, and when they increase everyone's quota to 100 MB this summer, it will really be a contender. I don't think it will be better than gmail, but maybe these combinations of features will be appealing.

      A few days ago I mentioned that I've sold my handheld devices and am currently deviceless. The experience has been interesting to say the least. While I am a believer in the power of these devices to store data, and also that they can be much easier and faster to use than powering up your laptop to check your calendar, that convenience has come at a price. Both financial and figurative. The devices are expensive, and are seen as geek tools. Neither of which I like, and both of which I'd like to avoid. So, I ditched my old devices and decided to see if I could go it alone. No devices.   I'm not sure if I can.   I find myself reaching for one to check my calendar. To find a contact. To make a notation to myself. It's frustrating at times and I find myself thinking "just go to the store, pick out a new one and move on". But it's not quite that easy. The one I would want would have to have wireless internet capability (wifi) capability, and they're not cheap. Whereas you can get a basic PDA for $150, I don't want one of those. I just sold 2 devices that were better than that, so why settle?   We'll see in time if I can actually live without one, or if I crack and buy something. Any bets? Leave a comment by clicking the comments link. (Although there may be a notice saying anonymous posts are not allowed, they are in fact fine. Post away.) Any PDA suggestions are fine, too.   You know, just in case I decide to buy. :-)

      Yesterday I migrated the main Revision Bar page over to the new Blogger template. After using Blogger for about a month, and figuring out how it works and what the benefits were, I decided to take the plunge. It's definitely a network-centric approach to doing things. I can edit this site using any computer, and that's a good thing. Posting couldn't be easier, either. I find that all in all, I post more often simply due to the simplicity afforded me by the Blogger methodolgy.  I also hooked in the older pages (pre Blogger; Feb. 2000 - April 2004) so you'll still be able to access those. I chose a new template using Blogger so the old pages and the newer ones basically match. There are some differences,  but not terrible. I feel it's nice to have some clue to the fact that changes have been made to the site design over the years, thus providing some insight that the site is making progress.  Look for the older pages on the right hand side  under  Archives  --  Older Archives .  Hopefully you'll enjoy the new look as I do. This site has always been an evolutionary thing for me. A way to test new things out and see what works. Although I will miss hand-coding everything, this will be fun for awhile and offers many advantages, such as the ability for you to leave comments. Although no one has done so yet, I hope to get some feedback in time and build up a nice rapport with whoever reads these pages.   Enjoy.

      While continuing my search for  urlLink gmail , I found a new site called  urlLink The Giving Tree . It's a site where people who want gmail can put their name on the list.  People who are current gmail users can see your name on the list and send you your invite.  The stipulation is that once you're a registered member and get invites of your own to pass out, you'll come back to The Giving Tree to pass them out. Thus, everybody wins.  I put my name on the list and was told there are 153 people ahead of me. Not too bad actually. I've been waiting weeks already, what's a few more days or so?   I've also read that Google has decided to open up more invitations and have given each current gmail member 3 more invitations. If true, that's good news for me and makes my odds of getting one better.

      The independant movie  urlLink Supersize Me  is making a big splash at the box office already, and it's only been released to a small number of theaters. Some of us (ahem, ahem) have been saying for years that fast food places like McDonalds are bad for your health.

      Enough ranting? I still want  urlLink gmail . Apparently nothing can bring me closer to this goal. I'm stuck waiting it out for the entire summer. It's too bad, because I could really use it to consolidate all my different accounts. It would be big enough  that I could hopefully go down to just one. Patience, patience, patience.

      Look out Dorothy. This is Kansas, and it's Tornado town. This woman apparently thought the correct thing to do was to go to the  urlLink bathroom . She was right.

      I'm currently palmpilot-less. I've sold all my recent goodies on Ebay. Stuff that was either outdated or infuriating. My  urlLink Palm Tungsten  T, my  urlLink Audiovox  Maestro. With both these devices gone, I now have no more handheld to help organize my life.    I'm thinking about a new Palm Zire, or maybe an HP Ipaq. Two different platforms, choices to make. Sony's out of the market now and I was pretty much set on a Clie. Rumors are that the prices on the Clies will be going down now to clear out the stock, but I'm still not sure. Buying on now just means it's a dead device with no future.

      Just an FYI, still looking to get into  urlLink gmail . And still no luck. Seems invitations are very hard to come by, which may explain why  urlLink Ebay's been so busy lately . I'm tempted to go to  urlLink spymac , which also offers 1GB of storage, but I really like the indexing method that gmail uses, where you don't use folders, you assign labels.   Guess I'll keep waiting. Patience has it's place.

       urlLink Yafro , a site where people can spontaneously post pictures of themselves and other things that catch their interest. Pictures taken while out and about with cell phones are popular on this site, as are nude or provocative pictures, for some reason. If you're into exhibitionism, check it out or start posting.

      I haven't posted about  urlLink Gmail  much since getting it from ksra_sra at  urlLink gmailswap . I guess I've had it a little less than a month now and it's just fantastic. I've totally dumped my old email account, despite it being a POP3 compliant and  being able to download messages and read them offline. The heck with that, I now say, since I got so much spam that what I was actually downloading most of the time were viruses. So, now I use gmail and go through the web and it's fast. Real fast. It's so fast I hardly notice any difference in speed between using it and Eudora. Now that's cool. And with 1GB the storage is, for the most part, unlimited. Or at least I'll never have to worry about reaching my limit for say, the next 6-10 years or more.   Gmail hasn't pleased everyone, however. Many privacy advocates are unhappy with the targeted ads that appear inline with the messages. Some even have set up sites proclaiming how  urlLink "creepy" gmail is . To each their own, I guess.   To ksra_sra, who gave me the account, I simply say thank you. It took me a while to create the CD full of software I promised at gmailswap, but I mailed it yesterday so it should be there soon. You're  urlLink globe-hopping  right now anyway, as documented in your blog, so hopefully you haven't missed it too much. Loved the  urlLink balloon animals , by the way.
