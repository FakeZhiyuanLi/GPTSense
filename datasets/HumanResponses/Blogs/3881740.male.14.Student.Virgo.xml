      For those of you who like the song, if any, here are the lyrics.   When there's trouble you know who to call  Teen Titans  From their tower they can see it all  Teen Titans  When there's evil on the attack  You can rest knowing they've got your back  Cause when the world needs heroes on patrol  Teen Titans..go  With their super powers they unite  Teen Titans  Never met a villain that they liked  Teen Titans  They've got &nbsp;the bad guys on the run  They never stop till the job is done  Cause when the world is losing all control  Teen Titans...go  1,2,3,4,Go!  Teen Titans

      I was just talking with my mom when she asked me when my cousin was gonna log in to MSN messenger.I told her i didn't know and that the last time my cousin logged in was 10 days,2hours and 12 minutes ago.Then she asked me wether that meant my cousin logged in 10 days ago and stayed online for 2 hours.When i told her no and why,she said i was wrong.I really don't understand the way parents think.They're stuck in a time long,long ago!

      I have decided to remove my display pic.I have officially become like air, you can't see me but you know i'm there.In other news, I have been introduced to a comical rpg called The Kingdom of Loathing.Very funny places there like Mt. Noob,The Gourd Tower, Cobb's Knob. And what crazy characters: Seal clubber,Turtle tamer,Pastamancer,Sauceror,Disco bandit and accordion thief.But it is also kinda puzzling(enter continuum transfunctioner:ring any bells?)Aw....what the hell!just go there and urlLink  play ! It makes you build stuff in air!(believe me or not)
