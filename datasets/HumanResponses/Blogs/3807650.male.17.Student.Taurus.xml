      Well I had a template for a blog of my own, but I cant be arsed to code it at the minute. So why do I want a blog? I want a blog to show my thoughts on things, cause I have a lot! Politics, world news, techie stuff and my family. I chose Blogger because its google, and I for one love google and at a push couldn't live without it!  So anyway, on with today. Wake up at 12 noon. Look at emails, not much there. Ring Kate (my girlfriend) to see what her plan for today is, she's off shopping in Lincoln with her mum and cousins (I live in Blackpool, you do the math). Okay so decide I'm gonna learn ASP .NET because I'm bored with PHP these days and I want something new to play with. But I thought I'd reformat first so I could have an nice clean install of XP to do my coding on. Gets stuck at 43 minutes remaining on the install and that's my day stalled for the moment. Goto bed hoping it will fix itself. Wake up 30 mins later, not fixed itself, my sister, b/f and their daughter (Rachel, Lee, Carlotta) making banging noises down stairs annoying the hell out of me.  Then off to get my other sister and daughter (Helen, Roxy) from Blackpool (I live in St Annes, 2 miles from Bpool). I've got a provisional license so I drive with my dad to get experience. I've just passed my Theory test last week which I'm chuffed with.  World news wise. Handing over Iraq to Iraq.. good idea or not? I'd say no, theres still too much violence going on and personally don't think they will be able to handle it on there own.  Sports news. Started watching the Holland vs Portugal game, saw it was 1 - 0 to Portugal last, I'm routing for Holland though... *checks what final score was (went to get sister)*... 2 - 1 Portugal bah! Oh well, good on you host country!  Currently. Downloading Microsoft Visual Web Developer Express 2005 Beta which is free for now and I was recommended it was good for developing ASP .NET. And I'm about to ring Kate to see how her day went!  Toodles for now

      Okay so since i found out it was Portugal and Greece in the final i wanted Greece to win cause there the "nobodys", i just had a feeling they would win with there jammy shots! They did play well though, but c'mon how well did Portugal play in the last 20 minutes, i found myself cheering them on in the end.  Watched Farenheit 9/11 the other day, great documentery! Can't believe some of the stuff Bush says like "I call upon all nations to stop these terrorists with whatever means neccesary" or something like that, but thats the one that caught my attention the most. I mean, come on Bush you can't say something like that, because, believe it or not, people will do it and especcially the with "whatever means neccesary" part. I didn't explain that very well but read it a few times i think you will get it.  Forgot to say i went to Alton Towers last week. I hate rides and always have done, i've been to Alton Towers like 6 times with my family and friends. But this time it was different. I went with Kate her sister, her sisters boyfriend and Kates 2 cousins visiting from America. So i was thinking to myself as Dannie was pushing me to go on air with them "yeah...right, or not". So i watched them enjoy themselves on air.... oh fun. But i hate being on my own in weird places and i really didn't want to spend the rest of the day waiting at the exit for them to come save me from boredom. Cue: Mikes Bravery. "that was well gooood!!!" and so forth... "what we going on next?!". Nemesis someone suggested. I don't know what overcome me but i thought about how little people actually died on these rides and decided to go for it and jump in at the deep end!  I LOVED IT!!!!  Air going past your face so fast you can feel the g's pulling at it. Coor! Next - Ripsaw, okay that was fun, but not as fun. Just the part with the suspended 60 feet in the air with my face looking at the ground, legs shaking desperately trying not to fall, didn't want to rely on the actual harness to save me from my death. Corkscrew was great, even braved the cable carts which i've hated for years. Anyway that was the day in Alton Towers for me!  Driving: Getting better. Can easily get off at junctions now, never stalling. Even reversed into our uber narrow garage a few times. Hopefully passing my test start of September time *grin*.  Jobs: Applying for a job with CSC (Computer Sciences) BIG company which i would love to work for. Mainly because of the fact they use more complex stuff than windows there ;). Also Â£220/week at 17 wouldn't be bad. Hopefully having an interview on Tuesday, wish me luck. I've also got somebody who works for CSC sponsoring my through the recruiting process which helps :).  Oh and tomorrow is the start of the World of Warcraft Closed Beta start date, get your name in there! Find it at  urlLink Blizzard !  Mmmm Warcraft 3...
