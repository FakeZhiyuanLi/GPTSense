      Who am I, that the Lord of all the earth Would care to know my name Would care to feel my hurt Who am I, that the Bright and Morning Star Would choose to light the way For my ever wandering heart  Not because of who I am But because of what You've done Not because of what I've done But because of who You're   Chorus: I am a flower quickly fading Here today and gone tomorrow A wave tossed in the ocean A vapor in the wind Still You hear me when I'm calling Lord, You catch me when I'm falling And You've told me who I am I am Yours, I am Yours  Who Am I, that the eyes that see my sin Would look on me with love and watch me rise again Who Am I, that the voice that calmed the sea Would call out through the rain And calm the storm in me  I am Yours Whom shall I fear Whom shall I fear 'Cause I am Yours I am Yours  I don't know who I am anymore. THats the great thing about the internet. I need a break w/ just me and no one else...well maybe R and S to help me find myself. I need my angels back. C hasn't called yet to report anything and I begged her not too! I am so happy. In the next few days or however long it takes...I'm going to try and find myself. I hung out w/ Z today! It was awesome. We went bikeriding and talked and stuff and then bowling. Where I met RR! My boyfriend. lol Actually we're not going out yet. I haven't asked him out yet but I know he wants to go out with me. Z told me. lol. Anyway...my heart isn't as broken as I thought it would be. I'm over everything thats happened because I know in the end...things will turn out okay. I may not feel Him right now but I know He is in me and helping me along the way and I know He is there. I see Him everyday in C. Who am I? I'm... HeArTsPiLlEr

      I am no longer allowed to have contact with my best friend H. It's because C reported H's mom for child abuse and well...h told her mom it was me. it wasnt me. I really didnt want to have to resort to that and H was my VERY FREAKIN BEST FRIEND. I don't know how I'm going to survive without her.  HeArTsPiLlEr's heart is broken...for now she can no longer spill a broken heart...ill be back when i recover from a broken heart. losing a best friend isn't an easy thing to get over  girl x

       Hey ya'll. Ok I'm going to come right out and say it. I get really weird strange dreams. My friend and I are talking about them right now. I've been having reoccuring hug dreams right now and like a month or two ago I was getting shot in the leg lots of times. Man that one really hurt!!! It was Mike...the man I am scared to death of....heres a description of this certain dream    &nbsp;  At my Middle school we went to the aud for an assembly or something and Mike was there. Agh?! I saw him look at me with a look of contempt in his face. I start to run but he grabs my left arms and twists it until it breaks...he has me down on THE GROUND defenseless in a room full of frightened students and teachers. He pulls his pistol out and starts shooting me in the left leg continuously. I'm just laying here CRYING and yelling for help. I see all my peers sitting around scared stiff and my best friend who dated this man is just standing there watching me endure this. I see my mom standing there with a scared look on her face. After he thinks I'm dead I guess he leaves and I am lifted...I can walk and I am brought to the hospital bleeding and after enduring all of this pain *i can actually still feel the bullets entering my leg* I wake up.    &nbsp;  How scary is that?!    &nbsp;  Let me know if you have any insight on these kind of dreams!

And it goes out to R...my boyfriend. I love you!  I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do  But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I found a reason for me To change who I use to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it the way And me the one who catches all your tears That's why I need you to hear  I found a reason for me To change who I use to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you And the reason is you And the reason is you And the reason is you  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I found a reason for me To change who I use to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you I found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you   It also goes out to my sister S and R my bro in law to be. He proposed July 7th and I am VERY happy for them! The wedding will be December 10th of 2005! Which will be a VERY EXCITING DAY FOR HER AND FOR ME! I can't wait.
