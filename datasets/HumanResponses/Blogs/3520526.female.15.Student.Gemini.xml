Reminds me of the cowardly lion (if you have not seen the wizard of oz..i am ashamed)anyways, i think i need to see if this oz guy is really livin up to his standards. Actually, if i remeber correctly, oz wasa total wimp who hid in a shower curtain or something. Maybe i should just ask toto? Au revior till i write again... -buzz

( lblah blah blah  this is where you say your opinion) (this is where i try to sound amused) anywyas...why are they called the dog days of summer? and isn't that in august or such? why am i even talking about it now then? i am certainly not wiser with my addition to my age...ah well :) and you out there who do not appreciate other people's useage of blogs...i wink at you. lol ...one too many dum-dum's for me...till whenever..

      yeha i know this may seem a bit odd...but hey. Is there really anyone out there who really has a deep crave for anchovies? what the heck are they really anyways...for some reason i thought they were some kind of artichoke, but HEY guess what they're fish...the things you learn everyday. What is the diffrence between a sardine and an anchovie anyways? All i know is that sardines got a game named after them, so they must be higher up on the appreciation scale. Have you ever heard someone respond positivley to the remark at a resturaunt : would you liek anchovies with that? Right you are: no. It's a sad sad thing, but I'm getting the hint that the little buggers aren't going to be swimming in the big blue for too much longer.   Rambling. It helps :)

      Brought back by poular request...I am now writing in my blog. Man i am WIPED out. By now i'm probably infested with various childrens' deadly diseases, along with a few smashed foods in my face and hair, oh yes, and a few bruises on top of it all. Oh, how i love Camp :) Hey well i am at  loss for words, most likely becuase of my lack of alertness at the moment (which means that i should not be drving, since that, of course, would be dangerous...drivers ed is quite the learning spot). So anyways...going to go soak up the sun that has been gone for a while :) till we meet again
