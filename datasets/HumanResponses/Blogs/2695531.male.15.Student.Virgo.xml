       unLEASHING the 9/11 Commission&nbsp;Report   The official 9/11 Commission's findings have been made public in a&nbsp;570 page&nbsp;report this morning.&nbsp; Our government should be ashamed of its intelligence failures, yet at the same time, we need to be optimistic for the future and prepare for the worst.&nbsp; Chairman Thomas Kean of the panel stated that the "United States government was simply not active enough in combating the terrorist threat before 9/11" and that U.S. officials had a "failure of imagination" in understanding the threat posed by al Qaeda before the attacks.&nbsp; The independent commission did not specifically blame either the Bush or Clinton administrations but rather our government's general intelligence capabilities as a whole.

       my SCOOP on MARTHA'S MESS     &nbsp;  As&nbsp;you are probably all well aware, Martha Stewart, America's favorite criminal/homemaker/cook/gardener/CEO-businesswoman Martha Stewart has been sentenced to five months in a federal penitentiary, five months of home confinement, $30k fine, and 2 years probation for her scheme with the ImClone stock-selling.&nbsp; Peter Bacanovic, her former broker, has&nbsp;also received a 5-month sentence.&nbsp; While we all have our views on Martha I would like to comment on how the media and the federal government went so far out of their way to degrade this woman as much as they possibly could.&nbsp; It is rumored that if it weren't for the rivalry between state and federal government officials on charging people as severely as possible, she would not be in this deep.&nbsp; After the collapse of Enron and the injustice Ken Lay and his sleezbag corporate pals did to the employees and stock-holders there, I think the government is trying to convey a message.&nbsp; The government wants to make an example of a person like Martha Stewart to discourage any more business scandals.&nbsp; While I believe the government  should  be hunting down&nbsp;"white collar" criminals, I don't believe that it should be allowed to "create" a case and ruin a possibly innocent person's career.&nbsp; Then again, thats just my opinion.

       "You're Fired!!!"  &nbsp; Thats right, Donald Trump couldn't pick a better time than now to use his copyrighted catch phrase, because&nbsp;ladies and gentlemen, it's happened again.&nbsp; Criticize the President, feel the wrath.&nbsp; Remember the Dixie Chicks and how they were "ashamed Bush is from Texas."&nbsp; I'm sure&nbsp;their recording studios&nbsp;were ashamed too...&nbsp;of their  record sales , after that episode.&nbsp; Then came Whoppi Goldberg and her&nbsp;anti-Bush remarks.&nbsp; Well, let me just say "You're fired!"&nbsp; Yes, her contract was killed.&nbsp; Now we have a Las Vegas performer, Linda Ronstadt, thrown out of a Casino (and never welcome back, says the owner) for dedicating a song to Michael Moore.&nbsp; I guess it's one thing to take politics to the extreme, but this is a democracy, not a Communist dictatorship.&nbsp; After all,&nbsp;our current&nbsp;president's&nbsp;father killed that kind of government (well, at least he took credit for it in his '92 State of the Union).&nbsp; In my opinion, they're&nbsp;saving the weapons of mass destruction&nbsp;so they can unleash them on Michael Moore if Bush loses the election.&nbsp; I guess free speech is just ... limited ... these days.

       35th Anniversary of the First Moon Landing     &nbsp;   "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind."&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Neil Armstrong,&nbsp;   July 20, 1969     &nbsp;  As described by President Nixon,  "For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, the people of this Earth are truly one."&nbsp;  It's been 35 years since that historical moment in history that so many Americans remember so clearly.&nbsp; Back then it was a fascination and a dream come true.&nbsp; Today, it is seen as the past: when President Bush expressed his hope for another lunar landing, the&nbsp;general American response was boredom.&nbsp; Maybe it is the fact that there is not much exciting exploration left to be done.&nbsp; Then again it might be that the moon is not as interesting as, say, Saturn and the other planets we are now exploring.&nbsp; Nevertheless, July 20, 1969, will be a date America and the world remembers as the day we opened the door to space exploration.

       my SCOOP on Michael Moore and his&nbsp;"Fahrenheit 9/11"  &nbsp;  He's the winner of the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.&nbsp; He's been called&nbsp;everything from a brilliant producer to liberal lying trash and just about everything in between.&nbsp; He's been called the liberal Rush Limbaugh and a political voice of Hollywood.&nbsp; He's Michael Moore, creator of the hot new controversial film, Fahrenheit 9/11.&nbsp; The documentary indicts George W. Bush and his administration on our intelligence failures that lead to 9/11 and introduces far-fetched allegations that alarm some and are dismissed as lies by others.&nbsp; The film's controversy sparks in the middle of a hot summer before a hot election.&nbsp; Experts say that this movie may open the door to more politically-motivated movies and documentaries.&nbsp; I haven't seen the movie yet but hope too soon.&nbsp; I can only assume that the Bush family has not yet seen it either.

       my SCOOP on the Death of the Marriage Amendment...     &nbsp;  Let me first say that regardless of my views on gay marriage in this country,&nbsp;its moral implications&nbsp;are not the primary concern here.&nbsp; All this was, was a not so ingenious plan by&nbsp;some panicking Republicans&nbsp;to further divide voters on issues that will create stronger party lines just in time for the November election.&nbsp; They knew as well as we did that it would not pass, but it created some heat -- some debate.&nbsp; The more divisive people are this political season the more likely they are to remain firm on supporting one candidate (and not changing their views).&nbsp; Bush, the "conservative, Christian patriot" would take the credit for at least trying to pass the amendment as he blames Kerry, the "liberal, immoral flip-flopper"&nbsp;for not doing so.&nbsp; Even if Kerry is our president next year, wouldn't it be a wonderful thing to attack him with?&nbsp; Nice try, Bush (or should I say Karl Rove?).  &nbsp;  What can we conclude? Election year  razzle dazzle  ... don't you love the drama?  &nbsp;

       Cheney Visit  &nbsp; I had a wonderful opportunity this month to meet the Vice President of the United States at a campaign rally in West Virginia&nbsp;very close to home.&nbsp; VP Cheney talked mainly about economic revival and homeland security.&nbsp; Of course, there was some Kerry-bashing too, but hey, that makes it fun! All in all, it was a great experience that I will always remember.

       WELCOME!  &nbsp; This summer has been so busy and I finally have a free day. Turns out its been so boring it's driving me crazier than when I actually work! Anyways, I've decided to start back up this blog after some serious reconstruction and deleting. I hope to create a journal as well as a page for my own editorials on current events, politics, philosophy, etc. I will also try to include links to some interesting and/or important must-see web sites. Thanks for visiting and come back soon to check my progress!
