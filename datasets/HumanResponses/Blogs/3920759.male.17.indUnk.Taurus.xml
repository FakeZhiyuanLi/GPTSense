      GOOD LORD I HATE WORKING AT MCDONALDS....these 6-2 shifts blow majorly, but a guy has to make money....i have this biatch manager named Davida (yeah, shes white) and i had to work with her the ENTIRE TIME..... not a fun day at all......Betsy is in Montana for 2 and a half weeks, so that also sucks... im going to see the show from Warrick county (Chicago) tomorrow night so anyone who wants to join me should call my cell or house phone.... i dont have any plans tonight, im a major loser....i still dont know what to do about my friend who is not being honest with me... i would confront them about it, but im one of those people who dont like to upset others, and im afraid id cause much drama and it wouldnt solve anything...im in a pickle and i dont know what to do, either way leads to bad things...give me some help PLEASE.....until tomorrow my friends

      well.....its done with....after countless hours of rehearsal the show is finally over, i get kind of a mixed reaction to this....im happy that maybe ill get some sleep for a change (because of my job at McDonalds working full-time), but im also sad that i may not see a lot of my friends from this show for a long time.... Todd, its been a fun time man, if u read this, i want u to contact me if ur ever in town, u have my cell phone number i think.....this also means that i wont get to see my girlfriend Betsy (who did a FANTASTIC job as Rosemary) half as much as i used to... this saddens me greatly.....id just like to take a moment to congratulate all of the seniors in the show, it was great.... i feel that someone close to me isnt being completely honest with me, but if i were to talk to them, there would be too much drama, and im not the kind of guy who likes to make people angry, what should i do about this situation??  well thats all for now...another update tomorrow
