      Just tried the (relatively) new  urlLink Qdoba  at the Prudential mall. I am a big fan.   The chicken queso burrito was great: incredible flavor (even without the habanero salsa, which I'll have to try next time), fresh ingredients, and four kinds of cheese.   More on my fast food obsession later...

      Intrigued by the trailer, and always up for a quirky independent film, I saw  urlLink Garden State  last Saturday. It definitely lives up to the promise of the trailer. The script is clever and moving.  urlLink Natalie Portman  is by turns funny, charming, and heartbreaking. The soundtrack is also terrific, matching the mood perfectly ( urlLink Nick Drake  is sure showing up a lot lately...not that I'm complaining).  And how can I not like a movie with  urlLink an ark and lots of rain ?  My criticisms are minor. As a writer/director, Braff is a bit too much in love with his script: some scenes rely excessively on dialog rather than trusting the camera and the (quite able) actors to get the point across. Similarly, Braff doesn't trust himself enough as a director on occasion. A scene between his character and Natalie Portman's in a bathtub (sorry Sid, they have their clothes on!) is wonderfully intimate when close up, but the shot eventually switches back wide, as if Braff is afraid he can't sustain it. He's wrong, he can.  Overall a wonderful movie, well worth seeing.

      So according to Blogger's Profile, I was born in the Year of the Sheep.  That's somewhat disappointing, even if I do like wool sweaters.  Note to self: eat more  urlLink lamb .  On the other hand, according to the  urlLink first match on Google , there's much to be said for the Year of the Sheep. We like material comfort and we complain about things. We also count amongst our number  urlLink Gene Hackman , one of my favorite actors. If you like him,  urlLink Morgan Freeman  or  urlLink Bacardi 8 , you are missing out if you haven't seen  urlLink Under Suspicion , an Under Promoted 2000 film with some great performances by all three. It doesn't hurt that  urlLink Monica Bellucci  is in the mix, either.

       " urlLink antediluvian "  It literally means "before the Biblical flood." I always look forward to rainstorms. I can't get too much of a good thing. 40 days and nights of a deluge would be just about right.  I also like the way it conjures up images of an ancient era: the kind you can only explore if you're  urlLink Indiana Jones .  I was disappointed when I learned that it has a negative connotation: outdated, archaic, antiquated. Then again, as  urlLink Hallsey  could tell you, I like "old man drinks".  Next time it rains, I'll have to have a  urlLink Manhattan .
