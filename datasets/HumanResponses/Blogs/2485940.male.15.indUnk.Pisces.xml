      I just read Elena's thing in my guestbook, again. Me and her have such good times together. She is the coolest girl I know. I really hope she comes to Sprague next year. I wish we could talk to each other more often. I miss her at Judson, even though we really didn't hang out until after I left that place. The fair was so awesome. So was the time we hung out all day, with yea the little ball of light. It was just one day, but I swear that made me feel like we've known each other for like ever. Good times with righty.  Happy new year everyone

      So, I heard some things I guess Hilary said about me today. If they're true or not, we'll find out later. I'm leaning towards truth, because this is the second time I've heard the same things from someone else. I'm pretty well angry about it. It's stupid how she's still going on about all this shit on, "Oh our relationship was stupid" and "I never liked him to being with." Well good for you if that's how you feel. Thanks for lying to me over and over again. Thanks for lying to cover up more lies. Thanks for totally leading me on, and thanks for being a dishonest waste of time. I had feelings for you, real feelings for you. I guess you don't know what that means. I thought I was a nice guy, but that's only up to a point. Just because I'm nice, doesn't mean I'll take in everything forever with a smile. You crossed the line. No one has done that for a long time. I tried to be everything for you, but you didn't even give me a thanks. All you gave me was a slap in the face.  I hope you get my email, and I hope you can find someone good enough for you so you can be satisfied. After all, you deserve it.                    Chris

      Today I hung out with Tiara and Brittany. It was Tiara's birthday.  Happy 14th birthday Tiara. We hung out and played in the snow and stuff. It was a great day. I had a lot of fun. One of those times where I actually brought out my inner kidness.  Whew, I miss them. It's gonna be icy tomorrow. I hope I can get in contact with Jordan and finally get my amp. I wanna write a song called, "Have you seen my Tiara?" inspired by her little sister's shirt. lol.

      It's late. I get weird when it's late. Like my thought process and stuff. If someone like me was talking to me right now, I'd be freaked. I wrote some poetry tonight. They were a continuation of a couple thoughts I had the other night. They're about Hilary. I'm over her, but the feeling is still there, and I guess it makes for good, sincere, writing.  Oh yea, it's snowing. What a blast. It better continue during school. yaya

      I finished reading Boy's Life this morning. I stayed up until 4:30 am reading it. It was a really good book.   Also, I made a really cool smore. I'll call it the urban smore I think. You melt the marshmallow in the microwave. Gotta be careful though, cuz it will blow up. Then you put chocolate syrup on the grahamcracker instead of chocolate. Yummy

      Almost halfway through Christmas break I think. I know this half will go fast though. I haven't done anything this break. I haven't hung out with anybody. I want to do something, I'm bored. I got a bad headache right now and it's annoying. Staring at the computer probably doesn't help, but oh well. I don't very much to say right now. Everything is back to plain normal. School and homework.

      I called Hilary today. I'm happy about that. At least I think we'll get to be pretty good friends. After she broke up with me, I think I took her all wrong. I think all my friends have her all wrong, too. She has good intent. I knew that, but was a little stupid anyway. Ah well, that's part of it; I guess.  Christmas is over. I like Christmas, but now I'm bored. I need someone to hang out with. I'll prolly call someone tomorrow. Maybe Elena could do something or maybe Alivia. I never hang out with Alivia that much though I talk to her all the time.  I figured out how to record songs to my computer like off instruments I play. That's pretty cool. I really want to learn how to write music. I think I have the creative lyrical mind, but maybe not the creative musical I want. Well it's not that, it's just that I don't know what I'm doing when it comes to composing music. I'll hit my teacher up about that. I really have a spark in me to become like some famous musician now. Dashboard Confessional all the way.

      This is my poem for the new year, and also I think it's going to be the first one in my new notebook. : )  Another year comes to an end Just think of all the places we've been  Hearts mended and broken Friendships created and lost Lessons learned from your mistakes Reaping the benefits but forgetting the costs  Losing yourself in someone else The first time they walked through the door Wondering as it closed on their way out How could someone so beautiful make you so sore  Finding something new in yourself A strength or weakness you never knew Figuring out when it's time to let go Sometimes there's nothing you can do  Seeing the truth in others The first stain of ugly in your world New pathways come into view As more of the world unfurls  Getting up on your own Putting aside all doubts Locating the light in the darkness Using it to find your way out  Testing your faith And your faith in others Counting on true friends To provide you with cover  New challenges confront you With difficulty never before dealt Realizing the important things in life And the importance of life itself  Maybe it wasn't as expected But just look at where we are Now a beginning of a new day A breath of fresh air, a clean slate, a fresh start

      I found Hilary's present on my doorstep today. She got me a notebook for my poetry. There was a few notes and pictures for me to have. I really want to talk to her about all of this. For whatever reason, I just need to talk to her. I'm going to call her the day after Christmas, even though I'd call her right now if it wasn't christmas eve. There's so much to be sorted out still, but I feel better. Thanks Hilary, for the notebook, the notes, the pictures, and everything you are, you've done, and we've done together.

      Merry Christmas Eve!! I'm thinking back to what I would be doing this day last year. I think today I would just now finish writing the last page of Brittany's poem and stick in that portfolio and wrap it.   Today is a good day. My second favorite holiday is Christmas next to Valentine's day. As things are going, Valentine's day will be the same lonely day as it's always been, but it's good to see the couples, unless they're breaking up on this day which is the worst thing but it happens a lot I guess. Who knows, maybe I'll have a girlfriend by then. It sure would be nice. I don't think I'm going to chase anybody down though. I know that Erin knows I like her now, and that's always a good thing.  Beats me if she likes me. Not a big deal. She's cool to hang out with, and I like to be around her. She looks really good in her glasses. I say that a lot about her, but seriously! That reminds me, I still need a pair.

      I walked to Audra's today to give her her Christmas present. I probably could have waited for a ride instead of walking out in the cold, but walking is better sometimes.   I'm glad things going on in Elena's life are better. She never deserves to have anything bad happen to her. She is the one of the nicest, funniest, and coolest people I have ever met. I'm so glad me and her are friends. I'd trade any Christmas present to hang out with Elane for a day cause I know we'd have a great time as always.  I've been reading  Boy's Life  lately. Hilary let me borrow a while back. It's her favorite book, and yea it is a really good book. I promised her I'd get it read by the end of the break. I'm going to go. I still hope she's actually making me something for Christmas like she said. I won't be hurt if she doesn't, but if she said she was going to then she should. I'm not going to call her or anything this break. Unless she drops by my house to give me her Christmas present then I won't talk to her until we get back to school.  I went out yesterday and bought the "Maxeen" debut album. Hilary told me she saw them on the Warped Tour so I downloaded some of their stuff. They sounded alright. It's always nice to have a good band that no one knows about, just as long as you don't get mad when people start to learn about them.   I'm not sure if I want to go to the recording studio during the break or not. I don't think I'm ready. I have a few more songs I'd like to get ready so I can record them to. I have Terra on piano I want to record and along with a couple guitar songs I wrote. I wish I was better singer, but I'm not so I'll make do.  I told like everybody who I like now. I'm not like one of those people that are like "Omg if they find out things will be ruined between us." I just think maybe things should have some time before you just go out and tell them you have a crush on them. She'll find out anyway, cause I know her friends will tell her. So Erin, if you're reading this...

      First day of vacation, yeehaw. I gave Erin her present yesterday. She got me this cool Hands Down vinyl. I think that was really awesome. She's off to California already; I'm gonna miss her.   I gotta give Audra her present today, too. I'll prolly walk over there and give it to her seeing as I don't have anything else to do as far as i know. I still hope Hilary will get done whatever she's making me. I'm kind of anxious to see what it is. I wonder what she's up to lately. I was gonna call her over the break sometime, but I don't know if I will. I still had a promise that I 'd finish her book before the break was up. I'm going to. It's a good book.  Well, I think I'm beginning to like someone else. That's a good thing; I think. It happened faster than I thought it would, but it makes sense for a reason that I can't tell you because it would give it away. I don't want to say anything about her just yet. I'm absolutely positive that she won't hurt me in a way that Hilary did by leading me on or whatever. That is if she ever feels the same anyway. Merry Christmas.  Chris

      Alright, today was one of those days. It was one of the days where you just finally come to conclusion about things. Yeah, I am too sensitive; it's true. Not like you didn't know that already, but I am. Not to blame that anybody but myself, I think it's because my dad. For as long as I've been able to see that my dad isn't the nicest guy, I've always said to myself that I wouldn't be like him. Well sometimes I am like him and I get short fused, but I think because I try so much to not be the angry guy he is, I turn into a over sensitive, maudlin freak. It hit me today that I need to seriously stop being so serious. I'm always going on about how I want to live up these 4 years of high school and getting crushed by at fourteen by a fourteen year old girl isn't how to do it. She can do whatever she wants.   Don't get me wrong about my dad. As much as I hate him sometimes for being such an asshole, I know he has it rough. This life is definitely not how he wanted things to work out. No one plans on struggling through the end of every month, and not being able to afford the finer things in life. It makes me sad sometimes when he talks to my brothers and I about how important it is to do good in school so we don't end up like him. He's so insensitive a lot of the time, and it's just really crazy when he starts to talk about his feelings about his life. I wish I could make him happy. Someday I just want to be rich so I can buy him all those things he wanted, and so he didn't have to work like hell just to pay the bills. I feel sorry for him. I feel like things should have been better for him. Just everything he's been through and is going through is what makes him such a bitter person. I know I get frustrated and angry with him all the time, but I need to remember that he doesn't want to be that way; that's just how he is. I love my dad.  If you're actually this, thanks. I love you. If you actually took the time to read and want to know how I feel that means a lot to me really. I don't know, just thought I needed to say that to you. Have a merry Christmas, or Hannukah, or Kwanza, or Birthday, Thanksgiving whatever.  Christo

      Talked to Audra again today, about Hilary or whatever. It's kinda making me mad actually. I don't do that a lot. She wanted to break up with, and she did. So she just needs to move on cuz she did what she wanted to. She keeps talking about all these things that she doesn't like about me or whatever like she's trying to reassure herself or whatever, I don't know, but it bugs me. I still like her I, but I'm not coming back to her and I don't expect her to come back to me. If she wants to talk about all the things she doesn't like about me she should tell it to me so I can at least stick up for myself.  Chris

      this is supposed to be at the beginning of the last post. I didn't get put in for whatever reason:  I found her. I gave her her shoes. I had a poem on a heart to go along with it. I took it off before I gave it to her. I had a note to give her though. She said whatever she was making me was really cool, but she said that I probably wouldn't like it because I hate her. That confused me a little bit. I wanted to tell her that I didn't hate her, and that if anything I still was in love with her. Instead, I just said merry Christmas and walked away.

      She makes me sad still. I know I'm over her. I know things are through, but I still can't help but wish we were still together sometimes. I got a SnoBall picture of me and her today. It's a good picture. She was smiling. Whether it was a real smile or a fake one, I found her. I gave her her shoes. I had a poem on a heart to go along with it. I took it off before I gave it to her. I had a note to give her though. She said whatever she was making me was really cool, but she said that I probably wouldn't like it because I hate her. That confused me a little bit. I wanted to tell her that I didn't hate her, and that if anything I still was in love with her. Instead, I just said merry Christmas and walked away. we looked good as a couple that night.  At least the guy I think she's after is a nice guy. She told me she couldn't do relationships, and that she'd be like single forever. Well, she's already looking at someone else. I don't know if they'll get together, but things like that seem inevitable sometimes.   That's how things go right? I don't know why I still keep going on about Hilary. Man....make it stop, lol. I need some good friends.  It's Christmas break finally, yay. I guess I'm going to the recording studio sometime after Christmas to record some piano, and I'm wondering if I should record some guitar too. That should be fun.

      I said Hi to Hilary today. She said hey. I guess that's somewhat of a good thing. I asked her if she wanted me to meet her at lunch so we could still exchange gifts. She said that whatever she's making me she's not done making yet. I'm still going to give her the shoes tomorrow. I don't know if she's telling the truth about not having them done and dropping them off at my house. For whatever reason, I'm having my doubts about believing anything she says. It could be that she won't get me anything, but I really don't think she would lie like that. I'm just not sure what to trust about her now. I'm pretty sure she was telling the truth though; so that's good.  Chris

      I had a weird dream about her last night. Come to think of it, I've had dreams about her for the past few nights, err. Well last night, she was like all over this one guy that I think she has a thing for (nameless). We were in a classroom, and we met eye to eye. I said hello, but she didn't say anything (kinda like what really happened yesterday). The dream the other was that, she was in my house or whatever just doing regular things. I was following her trying to get her to notice me, but she didn't. I reached out and tried to touch her, but my hand just fell right through.

      I didn't get to talk to Hilary again today. At least I wanted to say hi, just to show her I'm not mad or anything like that. I'll talk to her tomorrow for sure, well pretty sure. Hmph, I don't know what I feel about her. On one hand I tell myself that she lied and I don't need her. The other says that I still get I guess a little jealous that she doesn't hang out with me anymore. I shouldn't be jealous or whatever. I just miss having her around. Time will tell where this goes.

      I didn't talk to Hilary today. I waved, but she didn't wave back. She looked so cute today with her glasses on, but she's not mine anymore and that's okay. She was cool. Her and I will get to talking again sometime.  I feel bad for missing Elena's concert tonight. I told her I would go a few weeks ago, but I forgot. It's happening right now. If I could drive would totally make an entrance through the double doors, but I don't so here I am. I'm sorry Elena.  Chris

      I saw Hilary today. We just walked right past each other. I'm still in a good mood despite the fact that it still does bother me some. I have history with her tomorrow. There's a few questions I want to ask her about the time she burnt the picture of me and her because "it was a bad picture" and all those times she said, "I didn't see you!" But still, heart break is worth the risk.   Christo

      I went to church today for the first time in a long time. It's part of a deal with my mom since she bought me the guitar I wanted. It's not so bad if you don't pay attention. The only hard part is finding a way to occupy yourself for and hour and a half. I still am not totally positive that God exists. All the theories and philosophies have their "gaps."   I'm feeling a little better again about Hilary. I was off and on yesterday. Who knows what I'm going to do at lunch now. I realized that I really don't have a whole lot of close friends anymore. It's hard to find someone to talk to about things. Ironically, it's times like these where I wish I had a girlfriend. I'll find someone to hang out with.

      I wanted to see the parade tonight, but I didn't get a ride. I really needed to get out and do something otherwise I would start thinking about Hilary again. That's exactly what I ended up doing. I cried a little; I tried not to. Oh well, all I need is time. I feel fine, but I can't help it if it hurts.

      I felt better last night. I talked with some friends. It was suprising to me how I didn't take it so hard. I didn't cry after I got off the phone with her, and I didn't cry when I went to bed. I feel good right now, for the reason I don't know. It's sad of course that it's over, but I feel fine. Audra said that I can be "clingy" to people I like, and I totally understood that. If I saw myself through someone elses shoes, I know how someone could get that feeling about it. I don't think it's so much that I cling to someone I like, I think it's that my emotions are pretty strong for some people like that. Hilary's gone now and I'm not begging her to take me back. I think that would be clingy. Maybe I just need to stop showing my emotions so much and just live it out. That would be better for everyone.

      I called her. We broke up. She still likes me, though. I hope she does anyway. She said so. It could be one of those things where you have to tell someone you like them one more time to finally get over them. She said  she "drug this out too long." That kinda hurt when she said that. We weren't acting much along the lines of boyfriend-girlfriend anyway so our relationship remains the same for the most part. Well this is a bummer. I don't know what else to say. She is the greatest. We're still friends, that's always good. She said she just couldn't do relationships....I get that a lot. Maybe it's an overused excuse that doesn't really have any true meaning to it. There won't be any relationships in the near future. I'm done for now. Hilary was worth everything that I did for her. Nobody else is going to be able to make me want to work, think, and try so hard for them. She wrote me a note though for monday about this before I called her. She won't give it to me now since we already broke up;that's what the note was about.. I told her if she would just do one thing for me that I wanted her to give me the note still. She said no. Still as stubborn as ever, lol. I love her soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ever much. Maybe one day we'll get together again, because that would be nice.  Just Chris

      It's the weekend now. Hilary wasn't at school today, so I still don't know how things are going. I might have to wait until monday before I talk to her again. I wish she would call me and tell me what's going on. It could very well be she's just been in a mad mood this week.   I'm thinking about calling her right now, but I'm not quite sure if I should. One part of me says that, she hasn't called because she needs some time. The other part says that if she had good news to tell me she would have told me already. I don't know what I'm going to do yet. I don't like to worry and wonder at the same time. All I've been lately is mopey. She's the most wonderful girl I've ever met. I just wish I knew how she felt.

      I got a new one of these now. I don't know what happened to the old one. Well, here it is, tada!  Today was kind of rough. I don't really understand Hilary lots of the time, and it worries me. From all the experience that I've had, it would seem as though she didn't want to be with me anymore. She's different from anyone else I know though. I sat with her today at lunch, like always. She didn't say much, like always. She looked sad or bothered or something, like always. I wrote her a note last night. It was about everything that we've done together and how weird things are right now. I wasn't so sure if I should give it to her, but I did. I haven't talked to her since. I told her I was going to put my books away, and I asked her if she wanted to come with, but I knew she didn't. I came back hoping maybe she'd still be there by any sort of miracle. She wasn't. I figured if this was the last time we might be together that I want to find her and walk her to her class. She looked rather occupied when I found her, and I just walked away. I don't know about all of this. She could just be in one of her bad moods. She is a strange girl, but I love her with all my heart.                                                                        Hilary's Guy

      Today was cool. I went over to my Grandma's and I got her old polaroid camera and my uncle's old turntable. My other uncle is a repair guy and he said he'd fix the turntable for me, and I think all the camera needs is some film. I listened to my dad's old Jimi Hendrix LP's! That was pretty spiffy. I listened to them on my grandma's old turntable deal thing. It's like this huge like thing that sits on the floor. I used to think it was just a counter or something, but you lift the top and it has a radio, 8-track player, and a turntable. I was like whoa! Then I had spaghetti with my grandma. It was good. Oh then we stopped by my aunt Lauries and got some cookies, haha. My grandma rocks.

      Phew, the hard finals are over. They weren't even that hard come to think of it. I better stop talking about it; I'll jynx it. I saw Hilary today...why do I always talk about her even if I just see her once? She had a cool dress/skirt deal on, I can't remember. Seriously, she has like the coolest sense of style I have ever seen.  I've been writing a lot lately, like all the time. Not really anything completed though. I've been writing down little lines and phrases that come to mind.   I hope I do something cool this weekend. It's the end of the semester. A brand new start. I want to hear someone play some music. I've never been to a concert before. I want to go to a show or a gig or something.     Elena has a boyfriend! I'm happy for you.

      Geesh, where did everyone go all of a sudden? Everyone that used to say hi to me doesn't anymore. Then when I say hi to them, they just don't really pay attention. Ironically the last time I had a real good conversation was on the phone with Hilary on Saturday. I still don't think I should call her that often, just because I think she would get annoyed of me. Everyone I try and talk to someone though... they just doesn't seem interested. I am at a loss.

      Yesterday went pretty well. I went downtown with my mother because I wanted to get one of those old/golfer hats, and I found one, but I ended up changing my mind. I got a tee shirt though, so that's cool. On the way back, I stopped at Erin's to give her present/mission/scheme. She got this cool acoustic guitar! It's exactly the one I saw in a magazine the day before and was like, "That's the one I want!" She said she felt guilty for having and doesn't know if she wants to keep it, because her parents said they wouldn't get it cause of their budget. I thought it was pretty nice of her that she'd be considerate of her parents like that. Happy birthday Erin!  I went to sleep happy last night. I'm so excited about writing music now. I know that this is something I want to do. I know it's going to take me places I've never been, and that makes me so happy. wow. I really want to do this. I think I might be getting an acoustic guitar for my birthday too. My style fits more of an acoustic tone so it should make things a lot better.  Finals week this week. Hopefully I can stop at Judson this week since we get out earlier than they do. I'll bet the people are still uptight and won't let me in.

      I was feeling tired so I thought I'd take a walk and get something to drink. I went to the "Sun Market" and picked me up a Rockstar. While I was out there, I thought I'd just go ahead and go all the way to Walmart. I picked up "The Swiss Army Romance" woohoo! They had an PO box to write to, so I wrote them a letter. I won't get to mail it to them until monday though, but I hope they write back. That would be so cool.  I called Hilary after I got home from Walmart. I was nervous, but she was actually happy to hear from me. :) I feel so much better now. We talked for a couple hours or so, I mean we talked! haha, we haven't  really  talked since November. I think me and her will get to be good friends. I know it this time. That is such a nice thing to know. That makes me so so glad. :D whew. All is okay again.  Tomorrow is Erin's birthday! I gotta stop by her house sometime. I don't know when. I'll ring her up tomorrow or something.   ahh man, I still haven't started studying for finals yet....I still need to clean my room.   I'm just jabbering on this whole entry, but I guess the real jist is that I'm incredibly relieved that Hilary isn't mad at me, and that I think we're going to be friends after all.

      I've decided to name myself Tuxedo. I mean if I ever get band, that's what it'll be called, but for right now, Tuxedo is me and a guitar. If I wasn't so bad at singing, I'd say that Tuxedo is alright, lol.  Here I am; it's Saturday afternoon, and I'm home. I was supposed to go out at get my hat and look at glasses, but my mom didn't keep her word like usual. She said we might do it tomorrow, but dag nabbit I have stuff to do tomorrow.

      I saw Hilary today. I was walking to health. I went down the stairs and around the corner; she was right there. I know it's not a big deal, but I don't know, something about her just...it was weird. She saw me; I think she smiled, but I don't know. Do you ever have the feeling where you heart just stops? Well I got that feeling, and I guess still miss her. Whether I like her or not still, I'm not sure. I just miss her. I think just talking to her is all I need. I saw her again at lunch. She didn't look at me this time. I know it's not that she didn't see me, because I could tell she was looking away on purpose. I don't know how she feels. I guess I'll find out tomorrow.

      Alright, I'm gonna try to not be so stressed today. There.  Anyway,  On Saturday, I think I want to find one of those old fashioned hats. The ones that have a short bill and the top kinda folds over all "newsie" like. I wanna get one that matches with my suit, so I'll have the whole "newsie" look. Anyway, I saw some at Nordstrom's, but I think I'll try Goodwill and Value Village first. Somehow I think they could probably beat the price of a Nordstrom's hat...  Also, I'm probably going to call Hilary on Saturday just to see how she's been doing. We actually looked at each other yesterday! Wow! Amazing!!!! lol, actually it kinda is...geeze, I really do miss her smile. Well not just her smile, I mean the way she used to look at me when she smiled. Now I'm all reminiscing and I'm sad. I'll just call her. I just want to get us back to talking again. I shouldn't lose her completely you know.

      Dang it. I've been really stressed lately. I have bad luck or something. I just spilt some nice red cranberry juice all over the computer desk and carpet. My dad will really love that.   I think I already blew my new years resolutions. This sucks. I wish it was summer. sigh. give me something to hold on to.

      I went to sleep at 1 last night. Pretty crazy that I'm not tired this morning. I'm sure when I get to school the tiredness will hit me flat on my back. It was my Grandma's birthday yesterday. Both of my grandparents don't look very old, so that's cool. I hope I'm not a crippled old man when I get old.  It's Thursday already. That means tomorrow is Friday, yay! I really want to get final's over with. I don't think they'll be too hard. I just want them over with so I can forget everything I've learned this semester. I think things will get easier next semester, plus we get to start all over. I guess biology is going to be easy second term which is good cause it's my hardest class right now. I'm still planning on switching out mech tech II for drama. I'll take mech tech II next year. I kinda miss acting.  I haven't played guitar like at all this week, because my room is too messy to even take out my guitar, lol. There's things all over the ground from the "scheme," but I can clean them up since I'm done. Phew, finally. The scheme is good I think. I did a lot of craftier stuff I've never done before. I hate trial and error.  Well, off to another A day. A days are the best.

      Wow! I'm so happy right now you don't even know. I finally finished the one things....haha, my little brother said he saw Erin at like Roth's or something. Good thing I got dropped off before that or I would have been screwed!lol.  Boy, finals are coming up. They shouldn't be too bad. It's actually alright since I don't have homework anymore, just studying.   So mr.ice cream and mrs.cake has a computer. It has everything. That place is so cool. You can even "write on the walls."

      Alright, it's another school day, and here I am getting ready for school. I can't wait until after school today. I might be able to totally accomplish the rest of the "scheme."  I have to go to Walmart today, but I don't have a bike. So the next door neighbor kid is really cool, and imma ask him if I can borrow it for an hour or so. Man I can't wait. Walmart is the coolest. I hope something bad doesn't happen on the way there. I kinda have a weird feeling about today. Last time I had a weird feeling, some kid tried to pick a fight with me on the corner. He chickened out when I started to get irritated, but he wasn't worth fighting anyway. Some guts that little kid had, lol.  Anyway...S_C_H_O_O_L____N_E_I_G_H_B_O_R____W_A_L_M_A_R_T

      The mission/scheme is completed!...for the most part anyway. There's still a few more little "objectives" to accomplish. But nothing can go wrong now! yay!  I totally messed something up today, though. I was like, "Okay Chris, make sure you don't screw this part up," and then an hour later I looked back at it, and sure enough! I screwed that dang part up. Geezus. Oh well.  I hung out with my grandma today. She took me out to the boonies in West Salem to check out her grandpa's farm. She finally found the way, but by the time it was too late to go check it out. Sorry Grandma, another time though.  I got a bunch of homework to do tonight. Better start crackin.

      So yesterday was a great day. Elena and I did our little "scheme" downtown. That was a blast. Except after I got the results, "my" part of the scheme was messed up. So i have to find the way make up "my" part of the "scheme." I always have the best time hanging out with her. She's the greatest.  After I got home I went to my piano lesson, and I played a few songs on the guitar that I've been writing. I think that they songs are okay, but I really need to learn to sing louder/speak up. I hate being so quiet. I think it's something that could hold me back. Oh well, I'm off to school.

      Erin and I don't really talk anymore. Dah, that bugs me. Whenever she's online we hardly IM each other, and when we do we don't say much except for, "Hey, what's up." I don't know what happened, just one of those things I guess. I wonder why that happens anyway. Where you and someone just all of a sudden stop talking. It's weird. :(  Hello Erin, I miss you.  I'm going to call Hilary sometime. We shouldn't not talk. She's still cool in my book. I'm probably not even in hers anymore, haha. I want to catch up with her anyway.

      Today is going to be stay home day. That's alright though. I have a lot of things I need to take care of. I'm in the middle of cleaning my room, and then I think I'm going to finish making all those things for Erin.  I wrote some lyrics yesterday. It's hard to find a good guitar part for it though. I can't seem to find the sound I'm looking for. I guess I need to practice more. I put new strings on my guitar yesterday. All six strings once again, yay.  Hanging out with Elena tomorrow!

      It's sad how relationships work a lot of the time. If you could only rewind every day of one and watch it over again, you would see a lot of things you missed the first time. Things like the first sign of one liking another, but also the first sign of one falling away. You'd hear things like, "I love you forever!" and "I'll never leave you!" How many times is that really true? It must hurt to be the person that was told to and then to see the same person say it to someone else.   Love would be a sad movie. It would be depressing to watch how something so great could turn into nothing at all. Sometimes that process is slow and painful, sometimes short and unexpected. It would be sad to see both sides of the story. To see one person move on, but see the other still not having a day without thinking about them.   If I saw love, I would have to turn it off before the ending. If I watched the end, I would weep inside only to find that there was an ending to my love too.

      My dad totaled his car yesterday. He always said he wanted a car like he that one, and now it's worthless sitting in our driveway as he hit ice on the way to the job he doesn't like. It's not fair, but nothing is. I was going to sleep last night, and I heard him peek through the curtains just as he had when he first bought the car. Instead this time, he wasn't looking to see if he had really gotten the car he drooled over so much, he looked to see if the car he had always wanted had actually gotten wrecked.  I haven't heard from Hilary in weeks. I'm over her, but I guess I couldn't say that I don't still have some kind of feeling for her. I miss her. Her picture is still in my wallet, and I looked at it the other night. I felt a lump in my throat so I put it back. Everytime my computer says "you have mail," I'm a little jumpy to see if it's Hilary or not. Everytime I check it though, it's someone else. There's not going to be another Hilary, and the only Hilary there's ever going to be won't even meet my eyes anymore.  I don't care if she's mad at me or hates my guts. I just want her to say something.

      I've discovered a new way to express emotion, music. Well, maybe it's not new, but it is for me. It's like poetry and a melody, good stuff. After wrting Elena a song, it made me feel better than writing a poem could ever have. I think songs can hold more feeling than poetry, because the lyrics can also be poetic. So yea, I wanna start writing more music.

      It's one thing to be hurt yourself. When you see someone you absolutely love hurting, it hurts more than a pain that's your own could ever hurt.  A pain you have is one you can deal with, one you can surpress, one you can get out, one you can rationalize, one you can fix. To see your only best friend hurting, can rip you out because no matter if you'd die trying to make them feel better, you just can't. There's nothing you can say or do. You can't get them to think it out like however you think you may have.  You can't, you can't. All you can do is wait hoping that the pain you feel is somehow taking away from the bleeding feelings in them.  The worst feeling of hopeless, the worst feeling of helpless, the worst hurt you could ever have is hurting for someone else.   I love you Elena Grace Crowson, always, always, always. If you want to wipe your tears off on my shirt or scream at me until my ears bleed, I'm here for you, always, always...always.

      Well, it looks we had another week off of school. That's good I guess despite the fact that I've been totally bored stuck at home. I got Erin a birthday present today. Her birthday isn't until the end of the month, but I wanted to make sure I didn't spend my money before then, haha. I think it's cool. If she doesn't like it, she can give it to me. I haven't talked to her for awhile it feels like.   I've been putting all my poetry into the computer. I've read over every single thing I've written. I was pretty weird when I started. If you think I'm emotional now, back then it was way worse. My writing has matured a lot since I was a seventh grader. I think I'm more in control of my emotions, and I've learned to take a step back sometimes so I can see the whole picture. There's always a bright side to it; even though you might have to look hard for it's always there. That's an important lesson I've learned over these past couple of years.  Love: Everyone can take it while it's spelt front to back, but pronounce it when it's backwards, and can you take it then?

      I woke up to another day without school. I hope we don't have school tomorrow either; I still have an English paper to do. My dad went to pick up my mom at work. What a task.  I'm not sure what I'll be doing today. There's not a whole lot of options, because of the ice and all. It's cool not to do all the school work and stuff, but you get to see your friends at school. I'm stranded here. lol, I bet Elena is "stranded" at Cori's. That wouldn't be such a bad thing. I haven't hung with Cori in forever. She's one hillarious girl.  I'm finally out of that whole "jerk" phase I went through. Whether you noticed it or not, I felt like I was being one. I woke up yesterday and felt like myself again, so that's good....our lights are flickering...uh oh...  My poetry notebook is getting smaller and smaller each time I write in it. I've been writing in it since July 5th, 2002. I'll get another spiral notebook I think. I use Hilary's notebook for poems I have done already, because when I write them out it's way sloppy with all these things crossed out and arrows pointing every which way. The scrambled letters etched on the front of my notebook have faded. I can't even tell what they say anymore, even though I know what they did spell. I'm gonna start backing up all my poetry in the computer so just in case my house burns down or something. If my house ever did burn down, I would make sure to snag my poetry though. It's probably one of the most important things I have. When I got my poetry out of my burning house, then I would get all my notes and things from friends. The sentimental things are mainly what I'd miss; anything else could be replaced. Memories on the other hand, those are irreplaceable.   I was thinking about prison the other day, and I was thinking about why homeless people don't commit a crime and go to jail. If they did, they would have food, shelter, and clothing. I thought more about it, and prison would suck. You'd be confined to a cell. Some of those guys are in there for 20 years, other less and others more. 20 years... 20 years of your life, gone. I'm not even twenty. I can't imagine missing out on all those things I would have been doing durning those years. I would miss out on a whole life. A family, a career, and I would get a late start to everything. When I got out, I would be no one. I would have no roots. There'd be a twenty year gap in my life. That would be the worst. Sure you'd get food, shelter, and clothing, but you'd me missing out on the most important thing of all, a life.  ~Chris

      But you got me...  i'll be true i'll be useful i'll be cavalier  i'll be yours my dear and i'll belong to you if you just let me through  this is easy as lovers go so don't complicate it by hesitating and this is wonderful as loving goes this is tailor made, what's the sense in waiting?  and i said i've gotta be honest i've been waiting for you all my life for so long i thought i was asylum bound but just seeing you makes me think twice and being with you here makes me sane i fear i'll go crazy if you leave my side  you've got wits you've got looks you've got passion but are you brave enough to leave with me tonight?             ~Dashboard Confessional

      I just got back from hanging out with Erin and Brittany. Brittany asked me if I still liked Hilary...I don't know why, but I don't think I act like I'm very much into Erin. I am though, I just don't really show it. That's probably a bad thing. Sorry Erin. Well, sorry everyone. I haven't been acting like myself lately. I've been a little out of it, and I think I've been acting like a jerk lately.  So sorry if I've been one to anyone. I don't know what's wrong.

      Hilary emailed me back. As much I want to believe that's it true, I just can't. I feel bad for hurting her. I shouldn't have said anything about it. If I hear anything else, I just won't say anything about it, cuz it'll end up bad one way or another.  I didn't get to hang out with Elena, how sad. She's so cool. I was all excited too, ah well, next time.

       The Future Freaks Me Out   i'm on fire and now i think i'm ready to bust a move-check it out i'm rockin' steady, go  betty won’t stop  listening to modern rock how she hates to be alone i try to compensate her lack of love with coffee cake ice cream and a bottle of ten dollar wine she says "hey, i rock the haro sport. i rock the cowgirl blues. i rock too fast for love. i’m footloose in my velcro shoes. what’s up with will and grace? i don’t get drum and bass. the future freaks me out."   i’m on fire and now i think i’m ready to bust a move check it out i’m rockin steady to the beat in my head that goes oh oh oh oh  i know that she’s the only one i’d rather waste our time together yeah cause we can get down   betty can’t quit carving question marks in my wrist "how come we’re so alone?" we waste away the days with nicotine and television samples from an era we hate to admit we embrace we fail to represent we fail to be content we fail at everything we ever even try to attempt and so the story goes as only betty knows it’s time to take control   betty i need you i miss you i’m so alone without you to call up on the weekends with my cellular phone betty it’s so hard to relate to the whole human race i don’t know where to begin i don’t know where to begin if we could both find a way to do the things that we say we might not sit in our rooms and drink our daydreams away betty i’m a dreamer i’m not a vicious schemer oh betty won’t you-oh, fuck it

      Here's my last piece of poetry for 2003. Just for you, Hilary.  Here I thought you were someone Someone who knew where I was coming from But I turned my back for a second And you drove a stake through my heart for fun  To tell you what that does to me You'd just smirk at me and laugh In the end you'll be hurt It makes sense. Do the math  I don't love you now I've found the real you out You're ugly on the inside And now you're inside out  I see through the lies Hidden behind your once pretty eyes There's nothing you can say or do My life won't waste on you  There's something crawling under the skin on your face There's people out there with a kinder taste I don't want you anymore Since you're leaving shut the door  I don't love you now I've found the real you out You're ugly on the inside And now you're inside out

      Alright, I think I pretty much made up all my make-up work. So yea, I can get back to slacking on my present homework.  I talked to Alivia last night for the first time in like a long time. I thought she might have died or something we hadn't talked to each other in so long. I guess she was home when I stopped by her house the other day, but she didn't see it was me so she didn't answer. It was good catching up with her though. I think her, Erin, and I are going to see "A Secret Window" when it comes out. That should be fun. It comes out the friday after my birthday. It's fourteen days away including today. : )

      I went to the beach this weekend. That was good I guess, except I have all this homework and stuff to make up. I hate making up work.  So yea, that's pretty much it. I think this week is going to be hard with the new stuff we're learning in math and biology :(  Oh well.   Can't type, must work.

      Yea she didn't call. I guess she still might, but it's too late to do anything now. I've got a bunch of homework I need to take care of before tomorrow. That's a bummer. I was really looking forward to seeing Stephanie today.  Instead of hanging out with her, I took a walk. I went to Safeway, then Walmart, then Big Lots, then the Dollar tree. After that I walked over to Alivia's just to randomly stop by and say hi, but she wasn't home. I haven't talked to her in a long time; I wonder how she's been. I walked through Pringle on the way home and that was that. It killed a couple hours. I would have rather spent them hanging out with Stephanie! rar Stephanie!  Anyway, I'm just going to sit here the rest of the day. The rest of my family just went to Safeway and Walmart, haha.

      I talked to Stephanie last night. It has been awhile since we've talked to each other. We wanted to get together today. I'm not sure if we still will; it's almost half past one already.  I guess my family and I are going to stay over at the beach tomorrow night. That means no school Monday of course, :D I hope that'll be fun.

      Today was good, didn't do much. I looked after the neighbor kids for what only ended up being like 45 minutes, but I got ten dollars anyway so that's cool. I owe my mom some money, eeek.  Ummm, I guess that's it.

      Valentine's day was good today. First I woke up and went downtown. I got the Swiss Army Romance for Erin, but Sam Goody made me go over to Lancaster to get the DVD version of MMBS I wanted since they didn't have it downtown.  I got home at like 12 something and called up Erin. We met halfway over at Safeway then we went over to her house for awhile. We didn't do much. We just hung out in her bonus room and listened to music, haha. That's what it's like everytime I go there. It's not hugely exciting or anything like that, but I like it with her. She gave me a card she made and a bag of Valentine candy. I thought that was cool, especially since I wasn't expecting anything. :)  At around 3:30 we left to go see Big Fish. I really liked that movie, even the soundtrack was good. The girl in the movie reminded me of Erin, but she didn't think so. I guess nobody can look quite so good as Erin does.  When the movie ended, I wrote down an idea that hit me during the movie but didn't want to write it down in the middle of it. Brittany saw me writing and she said "What are you writing!?" She stole my notepad away from me, but I retrieved it, lol. I'm missing the page with all the writing on it though. That's alright; I probably wasn't going to use most of it anyway. I did however rewrite what I could remember on the car ride home.  Erin's dad took us home. Her parents are really cool. They're really nice to me. Erin said they like me, so I guess that's pretty good. She didn't like how her dad was all joking around, espcially with the billy-bob teeth. I don't know...I thought it was funny.  Cherise just randomly called me. It's 10:30. She wanted to know Hilary's number, haha. I tried to give it to her from memory, but I couldn't. After I read it off to her though, I was like oh yeah I remember it now. Wow, I sure wish she would talk to me sometimes, Hilary I mean. It can't be that much trouble. Oh well, I tried to keep in touch with her, but if she doesn't want to, there's not much I can do. "I'm here if you need me," that's how I ended my last email to Hilary.  btw, I need glasses...

      Friday finally, phew. Hey, I might hang out with Erin on Valentine's day! That'll be cool. Otherwise I would have stayed home or something, haha.  I went to Sam Goody yesterday to pick up the DC cd because they're making them without the dvd now, so I wanted to get one with the dvd before it was too late. The guy said that the one I was buying had the dvd on it, but it didn't. He said I could come back and he'd try to find me one with the dvd...I already looked at all the cd's and they all were the same so I don't know how that's going to work out. I'm going down there Saturday morning. Hopefully I'll get it out of the way before long so Erin and I can still go out that day.

      So I've been loning around lately. Crystal and I talked about it. We came to the conclusion that it's because I don't have any close friends. Seriously, I don't. Whenever I'm "part" of a little group or clic,  I always think the same words from a song, "You can count your friends, but you can't count on them." No offense or anything. I mean that I don't really have anyone I can come to, and I don't have anyone waiting for me. You know...for not having any close friends, Crystal is a pretty good friend.   So, if you've seen me, you've probably noticed that I look pretty depressed. I smile all the time, though. I smile to other people. I smile by myself. Around some of my friends, or acquantainces, I'm just kinda bummed. I don't really have anything in common with anyone.  I've been spending my time alone a lot lately. I eat lunch alone, outside by the abstract stairs. Come join me if you want. It is really nice out there, that's why I went out there in the first place. Besides that though, I'm out there because, I'd rather be alone than be left out.   I like to love to live. I like to play music, and write poetry. I like to think. I like to admire the beauty of the world, and the way it works. I like to smile about the future that has yet to come. I like to sit with someone and let whatever comes next have it's way with me. I like to have a few people that I can share life with, instead of a bunch of people that I don't  really  know.  Yea there are some people I miss. Some people that I just click with. Some people that have not so common interests. They might not be the same interests I have, but I can relate to them because not very many have anything it common with them either. That's what people like that have in common with me. I miss doing new things with them, and I miss learning new things about people and their real self.   Hey, maybe it's time for a change.

      Something cool happened yesterday, but I don't remember what it was. Let's see...umm Erin called me. That was pretty cool. I haven't talked to her in a while. I had to go to piano lesson so I had to leave her.  I was going to play the teacher some new guitar songs I wrote. I think of her more as a music teacher not a piano teacher. We ran out of time though, and she misplaced the cd's I let her borrow. She asked me if I wanted to do a festival this year, but I don't think I want to. I want to get Terra recorded, and then a few guitar song things.  I got my Drowning cd in the mail yesterday. I also went to walmart and picked up the Dashboard Confessional Unplugged cd. Two dashboard cd's in one day. I'm a freak.  We took this really hard nationwide math test. I only answered 10 out of 25 questions. It was crazy.          I'm missing you.

      I entered some songwriting contest yesterday. My mom told me I should do it for fun. I looked at the entry form, and it had to be in by Friday. I was like, "By Friday Mom!? No way!" So I walked into my room, but then an idea hit me so I wrote it down. Since I was already at it, I decided to just write out a whole song. So I spent the better of my day writing a song that I wasn't going to do anyway. Thanks to that, I didn't start any of my eight-subjects of homework until late, and I didn't get all of it done. That's okay though, I'll get it done at school today. It would be so cool if I won the contest.   Monday Morning: Let's start this routine over again

      I called Hilary last night. The phone call lasted exactly 1 minute and 29 seconds. That was kind of dissapointing. She was sleeping, oops. It was only 9 oclock, but I guess she was tired. Somehow I knew before I called her that it wasn't going to be a very good conversation. I was right.   Sigh. I guess a lot of people aren't like me. If anybody called me when I was sleeping, I would gladly carry out a conversation even if it was three in the morning.  Well, at least I gave her someone to think about when she went to bed. I really wish she would keep in touch though. I never want to lose anybody completely. It doesn't matter if she's my ex; I still want to talk to her sometimes. With every relationship, there is a friendship or else there wouldn't be a relationship at all. Our relationship is gone, yes, but our friendship can still be salvaged.  I started reading a book last night. It's by John Irving. I really like how it's so obvious where Carrabba got some influence if you read the book. Books are good.  Take me away from here.

      I'm feeling better today. Nicole was sick though, sad. If she's not sick on Sunday, we're going to go to Muchas Gracias. Jessica said that the three of us should go out for Chinese food, but Mexican food sounds better. Nicole told me Jessica was probably busy this weekend so I guess she won't be coming along. I never talk to Jeska anymore so that's a little bad.  Hilary switched out of my history class, and I never see her anymore. It's crazy how she is invisible all the time except for in that class we were in. I kept my history class, but I changed into art instead of mech tech. I didn't feel like dealing with the kids anymore, and I wanted a more creative outlet.  This is kind of weird, but I've had like dreams with Hilary in them for the past few nights, and sometimes I get the same one where we're downtown, and I'm looking at something. It's over on a corner by Front Street by the Riverfront. It's a non-existant corner with a glass case full of some object of art or artifact, and that's what I'm staring at. The thing inside the case is red. I look over to my left and then Hilary is just right there, and she smiles at me. I bet you think I'm crazy now huh, lol. Describing your dreams always makes you look like a freak.  I still like her...It wouldn't be so bad if her and I still talked every now and then, but since I wrote her, she hasn't written, typed, or called back. I said this yesterday, but well I miss her. Maybe she just doesn't want anything to do with me. I know if I asked her that she would say that's not true, but I don't know, I'd feel a lot better if she'd want to strike up a conversation with me sometime. It's not like I'm clinging on to her still, I just still like her. It's not really my choice whether I feel a certain way like this about someone. I could keep her off my mind the whole day, but the second she crosses my mind, I know that I am in love with her still. Yes, love.

      Everything has been bothering me lately, and I don't know why. I haven't hung out with anybody and just had a good time in a long time. There's a lot of things I want to get done, but I feel like I'm not making any progress. I wish I could just wake up one early, chilly, sunny morning, and take a walk with someone I love. Sounds a little stupid, but hey, that would be nice, and I would really like to do that someday. With somebody...when I can find somebody. I think I'm still hooked by the way. And that's probably bothering me too. I don't know why I'm always like that about girls. She never talks back to me, and I wish she would. I just want to make conversation with her once in a while. I know she's not very social, but just every now and then a few minutes.  I've been trying to keep myself under control lately. Sometimes I can. Other times I just don't think about it.

      Today was like yesterday. I was tired again, rar. I kept complaining about needing coffee. I still haven't got any. Where's my coffee!?  But hey, on the bright side, Elena wrote me a letter. I miss her. I hope she's doing alright. She sounds like she's having some problems right now. Look up Elena.

      Today was tiring. It was the first day back from spring break. I took the bus downtown immediately after school at had some coffee. I had to go downtown to check if Ranch got my cd in. It was the Amanda Rogers cd, and yea they had it. So that was good. Right when I got home, I was off to my piano lesson. That went swell. Kara critiques me and what not. I'm starting to learn to at least try to do different things with my music, and then decide whether or not if I like it or not. Is it ready to play in front of an audience? Hmm, I'm still a little timid.  Oh, I started another poem on the bus today. This is the second time an idea has hit me on the bus. It's not done yet, so you can't read it...if you wanted to I mean.

      Corey and I spent the night at Hartman's Friday night. Earlier that day me and corey bought orange plastic pancho's and kites at the Dollar Tree. I think we were looking pretty cool.  The next day, yesterday, I didn't do anything at all. Brittany was supposed to call me back, but she never did. I ended up waiting for her to call me back all day when I could have been out doing something else, especially since it was sunny.   The show at the Governor's Cup was one I wanted to see as well. I didn't go though. My parents didn't feel like taking me which was pretty lame because they waited until the bus already went by before they told me they weren't taking me.  I had a lot on my mind last night so I just slept on all of it. I went to bed at like 8:30. Erin woke up me because she called me, I was too tired to make any real sort of conversation. I'll probably give her a call back later today. It's too bad me and her didn't get to hang out this break. We had 9 days to do at least something I mean. Oh well, I'll catch her later probably.

      I went downtown today to pick up a new book. I walked in the rain to Jackson's Books to eventually pick out "Funnymen." I've yet to start it, but it sounds promising. It's about two comedians back in the 40's or 50's.  Before I went there, I stopped in for the first time at The Governor's Cup. The white mocha I ordered was as good as any, but I really liked the atmosphere. It was totally calm and peaceful. I'm sure the place might be a little more jumpy when bands play there. I might check out Hubcap Annie and The Coffee Romance on Saturday. Besides the atmosphere, they had muffins! So many coffee places lack muffins for one reason or another. They had them! I got one! It was good!  Anyway, I wrote this poem while on the bus ride home:  "Your Fading Zelda"  A present for you Only my eyes have ever seen The dust collects in its hideaway And it masks a glittering green  What once had meaning for me Has little value to you A gift I had gotten in hopes Of making old troubles up to you  For long it waited Excited as it lay But second thoughts of a good deed Gradually shooed excitement away  Because I know you so well Enough so that this gift Would jump you to every conclusion Except for the reason you've been given it  In fear of your fearing This present is stashed inside a box The date unknown for it to open Because your hard feelings keeps it locked

      Sigh, all I did today was mow my Grandma's lawn. Brittany couldn't go to Thank You Very Much nor could we hang out later tonight with Stephanie because she wasn't coming down until tomorrow, and she was home alone. I have the feeling that I won't be seeing either of them this break. Corey never called me either. I don't know what's up with that. Oh well.  I'll prolly finish my book today...then start another hopefully soon thereafter. I'm looking for a book that Erin had read called  Give a Boy a Gun . It sounds interesting. I feel like I haven't done anything exciting for the last few days, rar. It's spring break! I should be doing something....  Maybe Erin and I can get together tomorrow and see a movie. We haven't hung out in a while.

      Yesterday was alright, until my parents started arguing again. I knew it was going to happen because they were talking about why they were arguing the day before, which of course, turns into another argument. I took Erin's advice and just left.  I went downtown to the Riverfront and read some. That helped pass the time. I couldn't help but notice that it kept getting cooler, and then it finally started to rain. I bought coffee before I left. I also thought I'd buy my dad a sandwhich since he was complaining about how we didn't bring him home one the other day. The thought hit me on the way there that if I got him something he wouldn't even want it anyway. Pushing that thought aside, I got him a Angus Steak at Quizno's which has always been his favorite.  Nicole Hodgin and her friends were on the bus as I was going home. They were also on it when I got on, and I saw them downtown as well. She and friends were just everywhere haha.  Well I got home, and then I gave my dad his sandwhich. He says, "I don't want it. You eat it." Figures...I know better than to go out of my way for him anymore. You can't make him happy. There's no way.  I talked to Erin again later that night. I got to talking about my dad. I don't know how many of you reading this know what a subject my dad is for me. I couldn't stop myself at one point and just cried. Not too much, but well, it is a rough subject.   Anyway, I found out that Erin called me on my cell phone to see if I still wanted to see a movie, because it turns out that her brother wasn't coming up until today. For some reason her call didn't go through, and I never knew. Some luck, haha. Brittany couldn't go to "Thank You Very Much" with me yesterday either. She said for sure today. I'll have to wait until she calls.  And yea, there's the inside scoop on yesterday.

      I went downtown today. I saw Erin and Brittany there. We weren't really clicking. They were mad at me or something. I didn't say a whole lot. Ignoring is its own form of arrogance. I hope they didn't take it like that. I'm not mad at either one of them. hmph.  That kinda saddened my day.  I went to my piano lesson later that afternoon. I played my teacher the song I wrote, and she said that I really need to do something with it to like get it out there. She said that the song I wrote on guitar too wasn't too shabby. So that made me feel better. I feel anxious now about what to do next as far as music goes.

      Today was totally a stay-home day. I just hung out at the house a while. I think imma head downtown tomorrow to pick up a present for my friend. I don't know if she's even home this spring break, but I'll get her one anyway. I'll prolly talk to Steven or Corey tomorrow as well. Uhhh yea. It was pretty nice out today. I walked over to Walmart just a little bit ago. It was nice walking back. I wish I had someone to take a walk with sometimes. Sooner or later though.

      Hung out at Steven's with Corey and David yesterday. We filmed some stuff on the wheelchair. Balancing is like second nature now; it's relatively easy. We also went filmed some other stuff we did that night. It made for a pretty funny movie kinda...it's not done yet...

      hmm...school was rather uneventful. Brittany called me after school school so I could play her "My Immortal." I screwed it up some (hey my hands were cold, and I'm not perfect). I also played what I have of the song I wrote, and she seemed to be pretty happy about it. That's cool that someone actually likes what I wrote, haha.  One more day! no not my birthday...

      Steven and Corey did end up calling me. It was already like six though, and I didn't want to just go there and have to come home in like two hours so I didn't go over there with them. I have an orthodontist appointment tomorrow, but I'll catch up with them two on Friday most likely.  I just got off the phone with Brittany. I haven't talked to her in awhile. She's still cool. It cracks me up how she says her boyfriend gets really mad when she talks about me, haha. That's hillarious, who would be envious of me? :P

      Corey, Steven, and I all hung out yesterday. We went over to Goodwill a bought a wheelchair. Yeah, a wheelchair! It was seventy dollars, but we got them down to ten ;) It's so awesome! I bet you wish you had a wheelchair like ours with it's shiny wheels, padded seats, headrest that we don't know how to use; it even has emergency brakes.   I thought we were supposed to trick it out today, but they haven't called me so I take it that's a scratch through that plan.  Today was a good day, too. I was just in a generally good mood. I got taken out of PE to participate in some experiement for these psychology students. I told Jared that one of the guys looked like Dave Navarro, and he said he also looked like the kid guitarist in School of Rock. They had me and this other stranger start a conversation. I guess we were supposed to say opinionated statements, and that's how we got points. The other group told us that, and it kind of ruined it so I didn't say any opinionated statements because it would ruin the test. They got really bored with us at the end so I said I bunch of them so they could just quit like they wanted to, haha.

      Today was pretty good. I wore another goodwill outfit I got yesterday. Goodwill is the best.  I think I might have gotten over my weird loner stage. I don't what happened, but it's good that I'm feeling better. Audra today caught me in the halls today to say hey. I never see her anymore. She makes me laugh; we go way back.  I went to my piano lesson today, but I guess my teacher is in California. I didn't get the message. I called Erin and told her she could come, but then I found out. She gave me my present though! It was the So Impossible EP and a Honey Bucket sticker. I'm listening to the cd right now, yay. I like the card too. It's like a collage made of bits of newspaper, very stylish haha.  Gotta run

      I hung out with Steven and Corey yesterday. Corey hasn't changed at all, except I'm pretty sure he grew some. We were going to stay up all night, but my allergies or something were totally killing me. We had a bunch of coffee though, so I was still pretty energetic. Erin called me at like 3 in the morning. I told her she could. I wasn't expecting her to call after she hadn't when it was one-thirty or so. That was a nice goodnight note.   We made a to-do list for the three of us to complete over summer vacation. We already took care of some of the stuff. At about 2 or so last night we went out and tipped over this portapotty deal. That was cool. Steven and I also made a mixture of gross stuff for Corey to drink from a shot glass. The second it got in his mouth, it came right back up. That was quite incredible. Next time we get together I'm going to bring a video camera. Then when we're older we'll see all the stupid stuff we did.   Do it. Do it.

      I went downtown today to check out that coffee shop which is no longer The Green House Caffe. It's Dragonfly Cafe now I believe. Anyway, it was good coffee. They are having a Beatnik Night later this month. I might have to check that out. If anyone is so inclined to come with me to that, that'd be good.  I called Steven too. He ended up meeting me down there. We spent most of our time searching for yellow shoe laces. We finally found some goldenrodish ones at this shoe store. I got home a little bit ago, and they're not long enough...rats.   We talked about some stuff. Girls and friends and things like that. He's pretty knowledgable I've come to realize. I've learned to really trust him about things. I usually end up being wrong (or someone else takes it the wrong way), and he's pretty right when it comes to a lot of things like that. I've been kind of seperating myself from a lot of people because I've been feeling down and out of place. He knew where I was coming from. So that's cool.   I might see a Secret Window with him, corey, ellie, and sarah sometime this weekend or next. Sounds good.

      My alg class threw me a party today. That was pretty cool except for the fire drill that interrupted the ending of our movie. I'm glad it's the weekend, even though I don't think it will be that exciting. Corey is coming down. Hopefully I'll get to hang out with him for a little while, and my weekend won't be so blah.  I went downtown today to look for that coffee shop my piano teacher was telling me about. I didn't find it, and I didn't want to get too deep into the bad parts of town because hey I might get mugged. After all my looking, I didn't find it. I know where it is now though because I looked it up online. I'll go there this weekend sometime.  I don't really have any plans anymore. I'm not going to see a Secret Window after all. That's kind of a bummer. Maybe something will come up though.

      Today was pretty good. I ran a mile in 6:17 today. I was going for under 6 minutes, but it didn't quite work out. I should be able to get there sometime soon though. My best was 6:18 I think so I did beat my record. After school I went to my piano lesson. Kara said that I should play at a cafe or something, with like a whole bunch of people watching. I want to do that, but I think I still have a little ways before I'll be ready for something like that. That would be really cool though.  Elena wasn't feeling good today, or at least that's what her away message read. She said she needed a hug so on the way to my lesson I stopped by her house to give her a hug. I was thinking she would be happy I stopped by because I haven't seen her in so long, or I'd make a huge dork out of myself  and end up saying something like "I just thought I'd give you a hug..." It worked out though and it was good to see her. It was good to see her mom too, she's cool. We go way back to elementary school man.  I tell you, I'm going to make it in music, and that's going to be the greatest.

      I don't know why, but today was a rough day. Nothing bad happened, but it was just a pretty harsh day, and tomorrow looks good until you drive off the lot. Anywho, tonight is a good night for sleeping.

      I took the bus around town today to get some stuff. That was pretty good I guess. I saw Erin on out the window, and yea that was the only thing worth mentioning about the bus ride. So later, I was walking out by Safeway out by Fred Meyers when Jordan pulled up in his car. Him and David were out "having fun." They drove me over the Quizno's and I had a sandwhich and then I went home. Kind of unexciting huh, but that was my day.  A no reason sigh.

      Phew, the weekend's here. Today was a long week. I don't know why; I missed Monday, but it still was a long week. Let's see, tomorrow I want to go down to Weather's and pick up "My Immortal" sheet music because I guess they finally got it out. I was going to learn it by ear, but hey since they have the music I might as well just play it from paper. I got to get my eyes dialated on Sunday. That should be fun. Hopefully I won't have to get a haircut like my dad told me I would. I'll look like a goof.  I talked to Erin yesterday. She said that she couldn't get me what she originally wanted to get me anymore. Erin had this old guitar that her Grandpa gave to her, and she was going to fix it up and give it to me. She said her dad and her already fixed the neck, but her parents changed her mind about giving it to me since it was her Grandpa's guitar. That's understandble I said. It would have been too much of a gift for me anyway. I don't think I could have taken that from her without feeling really really guilty. It was the thought that counts though. Thanks Erin.

      I went to Safeway today to get a muffin from Starbucks because I was craving one all day. I got there, and they didn't have any! I had to buy a old dry banana-nut one from Safeway. I did get a Frappucino though. That was good. They need to get muffins in because I want to be a regular there on Thursdays afterschool. I don't know why. I think it would be cool though to go in and be like "the usual."   Haha, anyway, afterwards I walked over to Alivia's. She answered! I was so happy to see her. I haven't seen her in forever. She looks the exact same except I think she's a little taller. It was great though. We just kinda hung out awhile then I went home. Good day.

      Well I got them. I couldn't find blue ones, but I got black like everyone else. They're good though. I was amazed at how much better I could see. The people at LensCrafters thought I was weird, cuz I was all "oooh ahhh."  I got an eye exam too before hand. I started laughing when I took it though. It reminded me of this stand-up comedian that did a bit on seeing the optomotrist. I was in the room before the doctor came in and I was like, "Oh crap, I forgot to freshen my breath." Luckily I found some mints on the counter so I took some. I was glad she didn't notice and was like, "Hey, my mints are gone." I probably would have laughed and spit them in her face on accident, so that was good.  It was a pretty stressful day all and all. I have all the makeup work to do now. I always miss school on important days. I was late for my piano lesson today too. I told Erin she could come today if she wanted to. Luckily she didn't, because I didn't want her to be waiting for me.  Well I'm off, make up work awaits. Birthday in...pshh...like 8 days from tomorrow? Alright.

      Hey it's March. You know, school has gone by fast. There's only 4 months or so left.  I feel like it's going to quick. I kind of want to cherish these 3 1/2 years until  I graduate. I'm weird like that...cherish...school?  I get to get out of class today to go get some glasses. What a deal eh? I'll finally be able to see, and I'll finally look like my inner-geek. This way people won't waste their time talking to me only to find out I'm a nerd. With glasses, they'll take one look and be like, "Crap, don't make eyecontact or he'll come over and start talking about quantam physics and the new pocket protecter 3000."  Well, I'll let you know how the glasses deal works out. I'm excited.

      I almost got hit by car backing out after school today. Then when I got home, I took the bus downtown. The bus almost ditched me again! Some guy got off, and then he shut the doors, and I'm like "Hey! What's the big idea?" That's twice I've had that happen. Can drivers not see me?  Well I got downtown. It turns out Nightingale is what they're calling the YMCA teen center now as I've been informed by the Widget's singer. Also, while I was at Ranch, I picked up the Common Commotion EP from Hubcap Annie. That's who I'm seeing tomorrow night at Nightingale by the way. So come if you want. It's $3 at 7:30. The Mopps are with them so come along if you like them.  My pudding is done...

      Does anybody remember those things called YakBaks or something. You'd talk into them, and they would play your voice back in some funky way. I don't know. I was thinking about them while I was running today. Probably because I was thinking about how I could record music sessions for cheap, lol. But anyway, yea what happened to those?  So, I knew I shouldn't eat even close to a medium or large amount of food before running, but I did anyway. I knew that running would be a pain if I did, and it was. I better stop giving into myself.

      Dear Alex,     Today was Monday. The end.     I went to school yah? I found all my stuff that I left on friday. Except when I was getting it we ended up having a fire drill. So I followed everyone outside, because we didn't know where to go. Audra walked up to me, I never see audra, and had a little brief conversation. She's cool. I miss the band days with her. She says she has a stalker now. Why don't I have a stalker? Life just isn't fair. How come she always get's the stalkers? sigh...  So I came home. I had a piano lesson. I played guitar. Makes sense. I have a recital next thursday. Wanna come?  Wow. Music is great. I love it. You should listen to it. I should listen to it. How come I'm not listening to it? I better listen to some music.

      Sunday: A sit around the house did.   What did I do today: Sit around the house.  Actually, while I was sitting, I wrote a song. I came up with a really cool guitar part. I think I got my vocal and lyrical creativity back a little bit. I guess all I needed to do was indulge myself in some music.

      I heard some of Hubcap Annie's stuff before. I was like, geeze, this band is good, and I definitely wanted to see them live. I went down to the skaterock thing today to see them, and they're even better in person! I love them. If you don't know em, you should. It's kind of along the lines of Motion City Soundtrack with their synthisized backgrounds. They really have a great sound. You can definitely feel the chemistry throughout the band as they play their stuff. Awesome.

      I just got back from dessert with Alex. We went to Diary Queen with her family and then we went over to Nelson Park for an hour or so. That was good. I've never been over there, and it was pretty nice. The highlight was listening to the veggie tales cd in the car. Does it get any better?  My family ended up going to dinner for my dad's birthday today. I didn't think I'd be able to go because of my deal with Alex, but the times worked out so that was tasty.

      Okay so, Friday I might do something with Alex. Next friday for sure though...right Alex? On Saturday I'm going to that concert deal downtown. I might meet up with Cherise or something. There'll probably be a lot of people there, so maybe I'll run into you, and then you'll keep on running. Yea,  I have plans! but you know what I say about plans...uh oh...  In other news, my biology test was wayyyy too hard; I didn't even get it finished. I should still be okay. Hey, I A+ed my math quiz though.   What is it, 7 more weeks of school left? Where has the time gone? I'll see all you eighth graders at Sprague next year. Right Erin? Right Elena? Right, that's what I thought.  Ok, Happy.

My mom didn't like it, but I did...so we ended up getting it.  Romeo and Juliet is off. Surprise. Didn't I say that none of my plans ever work out?

I went to Best Buy, and I found the Hands Down single on cd and the new Sugarcult cd. Woohoo! So yea, here I am. I just had some wonderful egg flower soup, and what am I going to do for the rest of today?

      Today was lonely. I went to French early during lunch because I had nowhere else to go. There wasn't anybody in there. Hmm, I don't know what happened to everybody, but none of the people I used to hang out with hang out with me anymore. Pretty sad. I didn't feel good fourth period. I thought about going home, but I stuck it out.  Hopefully I'll do something interesting this weekend and preferrably not alone.

      I watched Donnie Darko today. I've heard about it for sometime, and it always seemed to me that it was one of those low profile movies that all the really cool nonpopular/underground/anticonformist/ people know, no offense. Like this one kid in my french class one day when the teacher was talking about the students' favorite movies was like, "Donnie Darko!" and this goth girl in the back was like, "Yea!" The teacher was like, "Donnie Darko?" and the kid who first said it was like "Yea! Destruction!"....After seeing the movie, there wasn't that much action, it was more focused on the plot than on how much stuff they could blow up. I thought he was just saying it to be cool, and I felt like I would be a poser if I saw it, but anyway, I borrowed it from Aaron and watched it today. It is a really good movie actually. I like how the leave it open to translation, so the viewer can take it and make it their own. I would watch it if I were you. Don't worry about the whole trying to be cool/poser thing.

      Oh yea, so there's this other guy at my school. I think he's junior. His name is Chris (like me). Anyway, I've seen him around and he strikes me as looking awfully familiar. I was walking around at lunch today, by myself mind you since everyone has better people to hang out with, and Logan Dunn stops me and says, "Hey! Stand next to this guy! You guys are like identical!"  Just thought I'd let you know that if you see another guy that has the same name as me and looks kind of like me,  that it's not me and he only looks like me. He might not even be my brother that looks like me but not quite so much like the other guy that looks like me and isn't me as well, but it just be that other guy that looks like me but isn't, okay? He doesn't have a retarded tooth either. lucky son of a...

      Today was just another "Just another day" type day. My eyes are killing me right now, because of allergies or something. Our group didn't get to speak in Biology today, so we're going next time. I want to get it done and just finish with all this evolution stuff.  I turned in my course requests for next year. I took a study hall because I have four advanced classes (eeek). I hope I get what I signed up for. It'll look like this:               Sem.1                                         Sem.2 -Honors American Gov't-----------------Honors Economics- -Honors Comp--------------------------Honors Lit--- -Honors Chemistry----------------------Honors Chemistry- -Pre calc-------------------------------Pre Calc-------- -French II------------------------------Classe de Francais deux -Intro to Theatre-----------------------Aerobic Fitness -Creative writing------------------------Food Choices -Study Hall-----------------------------Study Hall   It'll probably be a handfull. Don't be surprised if I don't have a life next year. I won't even have time to be alone, haha. Nah, I hope it won't be that bad.

      My piano lesson was at 4-5 today, because Erin, Tiara, and I got together. We played each other songs. I had to play my song on the guitar, and I felt that I must have tuned it lower or something because it seemed pretty low. Ummm...yea, it was good to seem them, even though I just saw them Friday.      hmm. there's. something. in. the. back. of. my. head.

So...yea going to church....even my dad....that's a first....actually, I'd rather have him not go. I'd rather not got either truthfully. I don't know why about my dad. I just don't see my dad as a church go-er. Not a big deal though.   Tonight I have to go to Melissa's house along with the rest of the biology group to finish up our debate work. It's a fine thing to do on Easter evening. I can't wait until I get these debates done and over.

I couldn't decide to get navy or the ones I got, so I had to dial up Erin for a second opinion...I know I can't even decide on my own shoes okay! I got them for $36 dollars at O-zone since they're closing. That kinda sucks though, because they always have the best selection of Chuck Taylors. Oh well, what can I do? Besides, Hey!

Then she says, "Tomorrow! Play! Judson!"  uh huhhhh. lol. so I'm going tonight. We're supposed to seek each other out. I haven't seen her in a while, and her me, so we'll probably walk by each other without even knowing it, haha jk. Pretty exiciting though anyway. I can't wait.

      A few friends and I had to move a piano across the school yesterday morning. It wouldn't go down the elevator so we had to take it around outside. We were about halfway it came to a skidding stop because one of the wheels had shattered.  The janitor came to help us put a dolley under it. It was about forty-five minutes into class before we got the piano there. I thought that we should have put the piano back when we could, because my piano playing on that song wasn't all too spectacular, but we were already there, so I played.   I was supposed to be the first one to give my speech. I figured that Sutherland would let other people go ahead of me since I was too busy with the piano situation, but she didn't. The class didn't seem to mind losing forty-five minutes of what would have been speech time.  I made the whole speech the night before, and the piano was a gimmick since it was over Duke Ellington. It was the teacher that forget to get the piano ahead of time, so pretty much it's her fault :)

      I've come to the conclusion that Corey, Steven, and I are all the best trendsetters in the world. You see, we were taking the quote "Do it!" from Starsky & Hutch long before any of you  followers  started saying it. I've also come to the conclusion that a lot of these "Do it" themselvers have not seen Starsky & Hutch, and do not even know where the phrase "Do it" has its general public roots. To be honest, I have not seen the movie itself either, but Steven and I (Corey has actually seen the movie) have an acceptable alibi. One evening, after seeing "A Secret Window," the three of us walked into the film exactly at the point where the two of them are in the bathroom putting on their "characters." We proceeded to watch the film through the Do it-ness section of the motion picture, and afterwards proceeded to exit the building. It wasn't long following that the quote "Do it!" became a natural part of our everyday lives. Using the two words for anything from "Get me some milk...Do it!" to reinforcing teacher requests such as, "Class, get out your homework..."  "...Do it!"  As you have now noticed, "Do it!" has found it's way into the vocabulary of many pupils that make up today's modern society. I'm absolutely kidding about being the best trendsetter in the world, but I was motivated by a certain combination of two letter words to conceive and produce this short essay of my link to the words "Do it." Those two words of course are "Do it." So have a good day. Do it!          By the way, ^^^this^^ ^ is what happens when you drink too much coffee in one day.

I have a speech due on Tuesday and my progress is as far as the research I've done. But, I haven't ever not finished a speech, so I'll make it through somehow I'm sure. So goodnight, I have things to dream about.  oh yea, Molly! I saw you!

      I was brushing my teeth at about 7 oclock last night when the phone rang. "Elena!" I thought to myself, but it was Erin and Alivia. They asked if I was going to the Star Party deal at Pringle, and they wanted to come. I told them I'd call them after I met up with Elena.   About ten minutes later, the phone rang again. This time it was Elena. Five or so minutes afterwards, I was in a van with Elena, her mom, her brother, and her brother's friend. We got to Pringle and we all split up. Elena and I went around the school and just kind of hung out. I asked if she wanted me to call Erin and Alivia. "I don't care," she said. "I don't care either," I told her. So with that said, we never called them. Don't get me wrong. I really wanted to see Erin and Alivia, but I haven't seen Elena in a long time, and I kinda wanted to catch up with her one-on-one, you know? I did feel bad for not calling them though. I hope they forgive me.  Elena and I had a good time like always. We were cracking up about something, and she said it was like the funniest thing, but I don't remember. Oh yeah, we were running away from this little girl that would chase after us, and I saw a girl with light up shoes. I guess it was pretty funny that I just entirely changed my focus from running away to "Holy crap! Light up shoes!"  We ran into the girl that was chasing again later in the night, and we took off running again. I was hiding behind a bush, and I felt my front pocket. It was empty. My glasses were in there. My glasses were gone, and after searching for awhile in the dark with a puny flashlight, I told Elena and her mom that I would just come back to tomorrow and look for them.  I looked for them today at Pringle. I didn't find them. It's kind of sad that I can't see, haha. Hopefully I can get new ones tomorrow or something. I think our insurance or something covers glasses so we don't have to go bankrupt over a new pair of frames. At least I know not to put my glasses in my pockets anymore.

      So I'm waiting for Elena to call in an hour or so. Ah man I'm excited! It doesn't even matter if I would have just saw her yesterday. I'm always happy to see her. Ahhh!  We're going to another "Star Gazing" thing if you wanna call it that...inside joke. I told her I might dress up like a geek, but I don't think she is, and I don't know if I still want to do it without her. Hmm. Oh well.  Hey it's friday, and I'm going out.

      Geeze, the city bus almost took off without me today. I stepped aside to let the people off, and the driver just started moving. I jumped in as he was going between the closing doors. He said to me "Whoa! Were you there the whole time!?"   hmph...he should have let me on for free.  Well, once I was on the bus, I thought, hey I could have got ran over, haha. Anyway, so I took the bus over to Weather's to get some Duke Ellington sheet music. There was this book full of his songs that I got. I haven't heard like any of his songs except Satin Doll so I'm listening to them right now to figure out which one I want to play.

      School tomorrow. Nine days left, just nine.    Forever everyone out of the loop with me. That would be everyone. I've been so stressed these past several...twelve....weeks or so that I've just been standing on the edge. It has really gotten to me. I always feel like I'm about to burst out in tears, and that anything little thing could set off the hair pull trigger on it. That's why I've been so introverted, so isolated, so dejected, so irritable, so not me.  I haven't had anything to look forward to in such a long time now. Everday it's been, get up, go to school, come home. do homework, sleep for what little hours I get, and go back to school. Then on the weekends, I just spend time alone. I haven't had time or the energy to put into any relationships. I've been living in a shell.   Well, I guess I still can't finish what I need to say. I just ran out of words. I don't know if it can be said. Can you say wrecked?  I love you, even if you're not around, and even if I'm not around to love you.

      Another dizzy dance Another hopeless case Another time, Another place We'll forget all of this  I'll put down your picture With your blue eyes Your zelda hair Your pink shirt And your smile that's never there  Oh no We're letting go I know  This time peace arrives too late This time is our last goodbye  Another season finale More rerun shows I know how the episodes end They are getting old  So I'll stash away your notes Some place safe Why do I bother They only tear me down anyway  And oh no We're letting go I know  This time peace arrives too late This time is our last goodbye  Oh no We're letting go Oh no

      So it's Memorial Day today. My weekend has gone pretty good. I saw a show at Nightengale Saturday. Taryn was supposed to give me a ride, but she didn't call me until after I had gotten there, haha. We met up later with her friend, who I still don't know her name, and yea the music was good, and it was fun.   I saw The Coffee Romance and Hubcap Annie yesterday evening at Salem First Christian. That was a really good show, too. I was alone though. I'm always alone. Don't you ever get sick of being alone? Besides that though, it was otherwise great, better than sitting here updating your blog.  Today is a stay home day. I got school and all that stuff to take care of for tomorrow. I think I can handle nine more days. If not, then I guess it'll be all over the news. Just kidding... Hopefully when school ends, I won't be so depressed all the time. If you haven't noticed, I am a little depressed in the true meaning of the word. It's just the stress of school and always being alone and not having a life. A good combination if you ask me. I don't know, I'm looking forward to summer. Maybe things can be less hectic and I can loosen up a bit.  See ya.       Thanks Crystal

       Emotional breakdown, right on time   God...            God?               I don't need a spiritual friend right now. I don't know if you even listen half the time. It doesn't matter though. I look like I'm talking to myself, and it feels that way too. I was told you can be anything that I needed. So if you can, I'd like a hug right about now. That might sound simple, and it is, but right now, all I want is just someone to hold on to me. There are so many people that say they love you and say they know you and are there for you, but so many of them don't. There's only a few people that I would feel comforted by in their arms. Sometimes, people are a hundred miles away and counting. Sometimes, people take smiles for smiles even if they cause the sharpest of pain. and whatever. what does this mean anyway? nothing. absolutely nothing. stupid blog, it's not helping anyone is it? I wish I could back to the same old sleep and have the same hopeless dreams right now, but of course I still have homework. Homework seems to be only thing that sticks with me these days. It might ruin my life now, but I'll be much better in the end right? Maybe I'll get to go to college and get a good job, and a house, and a car, and a family, and live for absolutely nothing except just to be. That's like buying clothes, just to have them. Useless. So whatever. I have to help the unaware, and make sure I don't look like anything is wrong so I don't get asked, "What the hell is wrong with you?" Well, there's obviously something wrong. Please don't say you're here for me. You're not. Otherwise I wouldn't be this way. I wouldn't need anybody to help me if I had someone to begin with.aapwoeijfapwoiefjapslkdfjapwoeifhapw94 3e8r792a83ra298rasdhksdafkhsdfahklasfd0239ru 209awspeofijjopi3awrwojeifawoperfjasl209a3ra09324t=-0a3w4t90ia32t9u8aw3t

      My brother is going to the prom tonight. That's pretty cool. I had to help him with all the cufflink stuff. That was pretty cool also. I hope he has a good time. I remember after SnoBall I told myself that I wasn't going to go to another formal dance until prom, but actually, I wouldn't mind going to another SnoBall. It wasn't that bad now that I think about it.  Anyway, my dad was arguing with my grandma about something about the way my brother should be wearing something, and my dad just totally screws up this saying. He says, "If it ain't fixed, don't broke it!" I was in the kitched, and I was like, "That's just terrible."  In other news, I still didn't get my haircut. In other other news, I'm going to the Nightengale tonight to watch some bands play. Crystal said her boyfriend is having his first show, and she said they're pretty good, so I'm looking forward to that. I should be able to take the bus unless I miss it again [shakes fist].

      Come off so content With your walk so confident Everyone can sense your presence You give me a smirk When I say I like your shirt Your stylish skirts  You look so placid It's only 'cause you're plastic You look so relaxed It's all just an act  Nobody likes a fake So take all of your make up And throw it all away You look so much better when you can see what's inside from the outside  There's more than your status And expensive habits You can't buy off what makes you saddest You're not so stiff If you'll open up a bit How else do you think you can get rid of it?  The news is spreading But don't take off running You can't turn your back on feelings you have already Let them out There's no other way out Silencing this will kill you without a doubt  So take off your shroud

      Well, I just put down two last songs in my notebook. It's full. There are no more pages to stain, no more feelings to write. It's sad, like it ended, but there's more to come. I feel like someone just died.   I'll stash you away and keep you safe, my blue Five-Star notebook with the scrambled letters of my first true love etched on the front with an exacto knife on a day where I was on top of this world.   Wow, memories. Is this overdoing it? You'd have to be me to understand.  July 5th, 2002 - May 16th 2004  There's a period at the end. There'll be blank pages at the beginning.

      I think I've talked about the guy at my school that looks like me and has the same name and all that. Well, anyway, I was in my biology class and Dan comes up to starts telling me about how he downloaded some of Chris's acoustic songs of the net. I was thinking, "What!? I do that too!" (write songs on the guitar). I guess it's not too much of a similarity, because I haven't heard them yet. I would have downloaded them, but my computer won't let me. So, I wonder if they'll resemble me when I hear them. I hope they don't, because that would be way too creepy. I did hear a song he did on the electric guitar though, and I must say he's a pretty good guitarist.

      My little brother got new shoes yesterday. He got those black monochrome Chuck Taylor high-tops. When I saw him come home, I was like, "You should have got the regular Chuck Taylors, cause they'll look better with more things," since I have them, and I know. He goes, "Chuck Taylors? These aren't Chuck Taylors. These are Converses! I got them so I could be a leader. Everyone has the regular ones. I don't want to be a follower." Then I say, "Everyone has the black ones! and you're not a leader because you don't even know what kind of shoes you have!" So now we're in the whole not serious, brother-to-brother argument that goes yes huh, nu uh, yes huh, nu uh, yes huh, and so on and so forth.  So he got the same shoes I have, and I never thought he actually would look up to me like that, since all he does is try to make fun of me which is really irritating, but I guess he does look up to me in a way because I picked up his shoes from erggg...the hall way (where I almost tripped on them)...and they said "lefty" and "righty." At first I was like Hey! You can't do that! but then I was like Hey! That's cool. but then I was like Hey! You can't--but--wait---no---okay fine; you are my little brother.

      Happy Mother's Day! We didn't do anything for Mother's Day. I'm out of money, and I didn't even know Mother's Day was coming up. I just made sure to make today a good day for her.  My dad sold his wrecked car today. He said he almost cried when he saw it leave on someone's trailer. I thought he was kidding, but maybe he wasn't. I know his car meant a lot to him. It's not like him to be attatched to such materialistic things, but I know how important it was to him that he finally got the car he always wanted. I mean, even when I was seven years old when we lived in this old apartments with this old car that was missing all but one hubcap and didn't even sit level, I remember he used to talk about that car and how he wanted it. So, the whole car deal is about the most unfair thing I've ever seen. Seven years it took for him to get that. He put so much time and money into making it just how he wanted, and then bam, taken away just like that. Someday, I'll make all those disappointments up to him.

      I went downtown and had the best tea! Wow, the Governor's Cup can make a good one. I had a cup of cinnamon-orange. Sooo good.         The last thing I said I was hello When the first thing you said was goodbye I've been dying to ask you What did you mean when you said That this will be best in the end We'll be better off as just friends  So does this look right Is this what you had in mind When even strangers can look in the eye I guess you were right We weren't worth a fight In the meantime I'm scarring your life  Maybe someday we'll meet up again We'll restart this chance This chance once again I'll catch up with you What have you been up to? Yes, it's good to see you too  But does this look right Is this what you had in mind Even strangers will look in the eye I guess you were right We weren't worth the fight In the meantime I'm a scar in your life  This won't ever change And this won't ever be the same You read your guys as your different stories Don't finish the one that has me worried I don't think I'll ever know When this case of ours is closed  So here you come my away again Will we speak this time Out of the corner of my eye I see you just keep walking by Forget everything I said

      I just got back from an evening walk. I went over to Pringle and layed down on the bench for about an hour and a half while the rain trickled down my face. Today was a bad day. I got so frustrated and fed-up with everything and nothing that I decided I really needed to get out. I reflected on a lot of things. I still don't know what's going on or where it's going.

      I feel like I just totally dissapointed Alex. We were talking about how people are changing for the worse, and how some people smoke and drink and all that stuff. She sounded pretty serious about it. Me, I wasn't too worried about it. Sure it's something I'd rather not have some of the people I know be involved with, but all I can do is tell them what I think, and the rest is up to them. If they're into it, then so be it. I'm not, and I told them, but it's their call, not mine. If I were to count up all my friends, I'm almost positive that the majority would have some kind of drug involvement. It doesn't make anyone a lesser person. The only thing it really affects is the fact that sometimes it's a little harder to trust some of them in certain situations, and yea sometimes that can make me pull away a little bit. Trust is important ya?   Some people I trust with going out and smoking and drinking some, and I'm okay with them when they do that. Other people, I don't think that they're that responsible, and I'm afraid for them sometimes. Some people are way too easily influenced and could easily be taken advantage of, and that worries me. But hey, we're teenagers. This is how it goes. I'm sure some people I know are going to let some of this stuff take over their lives or have it ruin them. Others, are just going to experiment a little bit, and they'll be okay. Your parents probably weren't ruined by smoking a couple bowls in highschool.  I know it's not the easiest thing watching someone you care about put themselves in a dangerous situation, but you're not always going to be there to stop them. As much as I love some of my friends, I can't control them. They're their own selves. Alex, you're going to be a freshman next year, and this stuff will be all over the place. I'm sorry to tell you that this is something you'll have to get used to. These people aren't bad people. They're just growing up. Wrong crowd? Maybe. Bad decisions? Maybe. You have to live to learn, and sometimes you just have to live.

      So Nicole has a stalker. Not really, but this guy she just met is totally coming on way to strong to her. It's kinda funny, kinda creepy. I'd go into details, but I'm too lazy today.  On the contrary though, I went running, and I went like 20% more distance than usual in the same amount of time. I don't know what happened. I must have got a runner's high or something because I felt like I could sprint the whole way, and I was already running at a pretty fast pace. That was pretty cool, but of course now I expect the same for tomorrow and every other day now.

      I went to see...sigh..Mean Girls with Alex, Kelsey, and Molly today. It actually wasn't that bad. I was surprised. After the movie, I hung around Alex's house for a few before her mom took me home. She showed me the dress she's going to wear for the eighth grade dance. It was pretty galmorous. I don't think I'll let her wear aviators. That would just ruin it.

      I wrote a sad sad song today on the piano. I was inspired by reading a sign for Brooke Carol Wilberger who's been missing since May 24, and she's believed to have been abducted. If you're reading this, you probably know all about it since it's been all over town for quite some time.  They're offering a 30.000 dollar reward for her. I got to thinking about how much 30,000 dollars is. At least, how much it is to my family. I mean, if we lost or had to pay 30,000 dollars, my family couldn't make it, and we'd be out of a home. My family, homeless.   Then I got to thinking about the Wilberger family. They'd very likely end up being homeless too having to lose $30,000. It just really struck me, the sacrifice to get a life back. A family is better off homeless and together, than having a bed but not being able to sleep at night.  Here are the lyrics so far, definitely not finished yet. It's inspired from the missing girl, but it's not about her. I use inspiration a lot of times to create something that I imagine.     "Grace"  It's money or life You never thought it'd come to this unpleasant surprise You see it all the time Who knew it could happen to you  Hell's broken through the ground And all around you see her face What's happened to this place? The world has become a disgrace  You're left watching, waiting, frozen, staring at the phone To hear the voice that's saying that your baby's coming home  You've lost track of the days It seems like yesterday everything was okay When you last looked in her eyes Nothings taken for granted when life's become unfastened  Your miracle's been buried in the ground You've never screamed so loud Nobody knows the pain What's happened to this place? The world has become a disgrace  You're left watching, waiting, frozen, staring at the phone To hear that voice that's saying that your baby's coming home

      Tonight I went and saw "Supersize Me" with Erin. It was an interesting movie and was definitely worth watching. Ummm, besides that, her and I just kinda hung around. We always end up doing that, just sitting, bringing up 30 seconds worth of conversation now and then. I guess it could probably get a little annoying, but I think it's fine. So, that was first time I hung out with her in awhile. She's still cool.

      I wrote new song on the piano today. It's not done lyrically and not quite done musically either, but it's a work in progress and that's good.

      I don't know what Jour de Pere is, or if the French really call Father's day "Jour de Pere," or if "jour" even really means "day" since I've already forgotten French. So yea, me and brother split a collector's edition dvd of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of which my dad plans on returning I guess. Hey, you're welcome though, Dad. My family didn't do anything special, but that was expected. I stayed home anyway, just so he wouldn't have a reason to get mad. I was talking to Erin, and she said her dad was sleeping, and I said my dad's been gone for like four hours, and no one knows where he went. She said, "It's their day right? They can do whatever they hell the want." Haha, good point. It's Father's Day, not Family and Father's Day.

      Alright, back to blogging ummm yesterday I hung out with Corey, Steven, and Heath down my the river. I forgot the shorts that Steven lent me, so I was kinda doing everything in my underwear. That was pretty comfortable I thought. We found a dead fish, and we were throwing rocks at it. Yup.  So later, uh, hmm, we didn't do much I guess. I went home. And then later I went out with Taryn and Katie, and got coffee. Then I was back home again...and now I'm gonna go downtown in a bit to pick up the Julian Snow Trio's Doodle. Alright. There. I blogged.

      Schools out for the summer, drrr, like nobody noticed? Our math teacher retired. She was the coolest teacher ever. We have this little swear jar. So today, I was like (since I don't have any money), "Why doesn't someone give her fifty cents and then tell her to fuck off?" So we got Teddy to do it. It was all in good fun. She laughed. Then she brought this little marshmallow gun and started shooting us, crazy.   Here I am on the verge of summer. With every ending comes a new beginning, and some things just have to end. I might get a job with this guy that Steven used to work for. It's just a little landscaping job. That would be cool. I have to give the guy a call in a few.  I guess there's a Hubcap Annie show at the Gov Cup sometime as Taryn says. Sweet, I'm there. Take it easy.

      brown blonde hair, and pretty blue eyes. that’s my description of beauty outside. with a smile of teeth, "what’s attraction beneath when all that matters is beauty skin deep?" because someday, someday my prince will come. someday, someday you’ll see.  someday, someday my prince will come. someday, someday just you wait and see. any boy to love me would be a fool. cause popularity around me can be cruel. perspective is a mindset uncommon to me. so smoke your pot and let me be.

      Since when can you not believe me? Am I such an unhonest and unfaithful person now that you can't even trust me about a simple show date? You know? Whatever. I'm by myself too much of the time anyway. You're not there any of the time. I'm so sick of being alone, and now you can't even trust me. Why? I've had it up to the top of my hair. I have two people that I talk to. One I just met one week ago. The other is someone who cares enough to hear me out.  I used to have friends. Now all I have is myself. See you at the show.

      There's a huge uprising against cutting my hair like night raids and village attacks and stuff, but sorry, it has to be done. If it doesn't work then maybe I'll keep it long when it grows out again. If it's a bad haircut then I'll get another one, but if short hair is just stupid then I'll grow it out, okay? Have we come to an agreement? Yes? These hair wars are stupid!  See you on Friday without looking through a filter of black locks.

      Well I went downtown today to see if I could find the first Coffee Romance EP or the Strength EP by Hubcap Annie. The band said they were sold out of their new one, so I didn't know if that meant Our First Basement Winter or The Strength EP, but either way, I didn't find it. I did get the Strawberries album though, because there's definitely a lot of hype following them and it's pretty accurate. They're pretty good.   I had some time to kill afterwards so I went over to Gov Cup to get some tea. I wanted to try something different this time. So I go in there and lo and behold, Jon Hastings works there man! He recommended me some raspberry/tropicana iced tea. I drank that, and it was cool and quenching. I wanted to tell him how much I loved their (the new drummer Brandon Smith was there by that time too) music, but I'm a little shy, so all I got out was, "Thanks, the drink was good."  So now, I go over to the bus stop, and I'm sitting reading the Salem Monthly when this girl comes up to me and hands me a little flyer.    FREE DINNER AT THE YMCA: 5PM EVERY WEDNESDAY   Well, I didn't really need a free meal, but she gave the flyer to me so I had to check it out. I got there and had some soup, a piece of bread, and some punch, and then punched out.   I get back to the bus stop in time for the #1 to pick me up, and I get on moving. I decided to stop by Harvest Records, where I've been meaning to stop by except it's so out of the way if you don't drive. I got there and found Audioboxer for four dollars and twenty-five cents! So I got that, and some laffy taffy out of the "I ate too much candieeeeeeee, take some" dish by the cash register. I put that cd in and walked out.  Continuing to stroll south down Commericial, I thought I'd head over to Weather's. Sometimes I find something of interest there. Other times I'm just drooling over things I wish I could afford. I got to about the BBQ Pit when I observed that the lights were a little low for an open store. There were cars in the parking lot, but the lights were still low. That's when I saw the lights completely go off. I looked at the time: 6:20. Rats.  That wasn't a big deal. I merely waited at the nearest bus stop to take me home. I got home, relaxed for about an hour, and then ran for a half. I was making some good time until I got back to my neighborhood. I just was shot when I got there. I'm doing this whole personal goal thing where I want to do my usual route and then two laps around my block in thirty minutes. I would have definitely made it if I wasn't so fatigued. I was at a very easy jog for the one and a half laps around the block. When I stopped and walked to cool down, my legs were on fire. I was in some kind of agony walking back home. My legs, especially my calves, were and still are so sore. I must have worn something out. I guess I'll take it easy for a while, huh?  Laffy Taffy is for Taryn if we run into each other. That's how we met in the first place, so if I see her and I have it on me tomorrow I'll give it to her just for kicks. I sure hope Harvest didn't poison it, because that would leave a bad mark.

      Eight, count em, eight days left  Today was really nice, weather wise anyway. I just had my last, I'll call them, "music" lesson. So it's starting to feel like summer, and the illusion of a never ending school year is finally starting to disappate.  I went with my grandma to Value Village to see if I could find a shirt of proper length. We didn't, but she said she could hem the one I got. I wish she would have told me that earlier so we didn't have to go all the way out there, but that's cool. I ordered some shoes today. Some nice brown tennis shoes. My black monochrome hi-tops are too gothic for some outfits, and my patriotic red/blue two tone ones are too bright for others, so brown is a good, blend with everything, medium.  My plan for the friday after school gets out is get a haircut. It won't matter if it's bad because no one will see me anyway right? And I don't have a girlfriend that would throw me out for a bad chop. It was getting irritating when I run anyway.

      Well, I knew that pretty soon it was gonna be total destruction or definite rehabilitation. That limbo stuff just doesn't fly forever. So, that's "friggin' sweet," dare I say. But seriously, when someone needs to be alone, let them be alone. Just don't be poking your nose in like somehow the rules don't apply to you. Okay? Okay.

      I just got home from the coast. That place is always good for one thing if nothing else. It's a great place to contemplate and get out those deep thoughts that have been stirring. So, a lot of thinking went on, not that I feel any different than when I first left, but I got a little further on understanding why I feel this way and all that stuff. I saw a lot of lost opportunities and things that I'll probably never get to do. There's not a whole lot that can be done. I got a strong feeling about just wanting to restart. Just a new beginning somewhere where no one knows who I am. Beats me. You can only make a first impression once. If you screw it up you can't start over. You can't take back mistakes or redo things over. What you've made of your life you live with. I guess that's all there is to it.  To everyone, don't think I hate you. I don't. And don't think that I think that you don't care about me. I know you do. Just, It only makes it harder with your being here. Things'll get sorted out, okay? Worrying won't help either of us.

      I walked to walmart tonight and spent my money on cd's, batteries, and my eighth nonwinning one-in-twelve's-a-winner Sobe. True, money doesn't make you happy, but spending it does, hah. Not really though, it's not the spending part, or the stuff I bought part, I just feel more at ease when I don't have any money for some odd reason. I guess it makes me more resourceful and it's one less thing to worry about.

      I closed my eyes for an instant  And when they opened everything was gone  All that kept me going no longer existed  The make up of this new world is wrong    The reflection from your eyes can no longer  Be projected without signs or hints of fear  My countenance has been pulled from joyous to somber  Decadence has dragged you away from here    Only the sadness seems to last forever  As its emptiness futilely tries to fill my heart  My own skin is all that's holding me together  Shattered inside, my soul is falling apart    My head is throbbing as this battle rages inside me  I hate you but the side that will always love you has won  I've given you all I can to keep you thriving  But you've never thanked who you've been taking it from    You go on doing what you have been  Without realizing, more than your problems, you're drowning me  I hope you know where your path ends  You'll be sorry eventually    I go on doing what I can and can say  Turning around just because you want someone by your side  But I'm running low on room for these feelings in me to stay  I think right now, not you, but it's me who needs help this time

      Well that's pretty self explanatory isn't it? &nbsp; I was talking to drunk girl yesterday evening, and she asked me if I ever wondered what would happen if you died, like who would be at your funeral.&nbsp; I said a lot of people would be at my funeral. I bet a whole bunch of people would be there all sad and mourning over me, but it would be so fake and disgusting. Yea I've thought a lot&nbsp;about what would happen if I died. At least for me it would be something real. &nbsp; I'm way too stressed. I've got nothing to do, and I'm stressed, tense, and ancy. I hope everyone is having fun though. I wish I had more money so I could do nice things for you people and make myself feel worse. I hate myself. I'm not going anywhere right now. I'm just&nbsp;dawdling around whining and complaining wherever I go like an ungrateful little bastard, just like now And don't come&nbsp;up to me and be like, "Gee Chris, what's wrong? I hope you feel better." Thanks, but you can't help. It only makes things worse. Just leave me alone. I seem to be pretty good at being that way anyway.

      Let's see, I woke up today, and my stomach felt terrible. So I called in sick for work and went back to bed. I woke up at about ten-ish, and I was feeling much better. Corey IMed me and wanted to hang out. I got ready, and rode my little brother's bike to Circle K to rendezvous with Corey. Hmm, then what happened. I was going down Commercial. I see this white "Serving The City of Salem" truck stopped at the intersection right before WinCo. I start to cross the street on my bike, and without even looking, the lady in the truck starts going, and SHE HITS ME WITH HER DAMN TRUCK! I fly off my bike into the middle of the street. I get up, and the first thing a say is "Wow, that was a first."  Anyway, she doesn't even get out of her car. She rolls down her window and asks, "Are you okay?" I said I was. She also asked if my bike was okay and I said yea. The lady just drives off like nothing happened.  These cops were stopped at the light a few cars back. They stop to ask if I was okay. I said I was and that so was my bike. Then they leave too. I start riding my little brother's bike, and guess what, it's not okay. She totally wrecked the back wheel so that was no good. I did however manage to get it to Walmart where Corey and I picked out a new bike, rode it down to West Salem and back, and then returned it for a full refund.  At least next time I know I should make them get me a new bike...or some money.

      I went to see Napoleon Dynamite again. Partly because it's a good movie and partly because I wanted to actually meet Jon Heder this time. I wanted to meet him the opening night when I was there, but I'm too shy to get the courage to say anything to him. Everytime I'd see him, I'd be like, "Ahh, what do I do?"  So anyway, after the movie, Jon got up front to do the Q and A session. In the middle of it, the host lady comes out to interrupt. She says to everyone that Napoleon Dynamite is the fifteenth highest grossing film in America, and it's only being played in a hundred some odd theatres right now while the big films are being showed in a thousand or two thousand cinemas. I was like holy crap! and I summoned up the guts to ask him a question about how he felt to know that the film is already the fifteenth highest grossing motion picture out there. Even asking that, got me all nervous.  As I was leaving, I knew I had to meet him, because in a few weeks, Jon Heder is going to explode, and I might not get another chance to meet someone like him. So I bought a quarter-sheet and had him autograph it for me. I told him that I wanted to meet him last time, but I was too shy. So he says, "Aww, well lets meet then," in a jokingly patronizing voice as he stuck out his hand. I laughed and shook his hand, and that was a good moment. I felt fulfilled that I got to meet someone so cool and that I actually put my shyness aside for a moment or two.

      it's cold and i'm alone and i can't feel safe  there's a pressure on my chest and i feel hollow and i can't sleep  the sheets i'm under are scratching me and i can't seem to shake them and i don't want to the let them go  these white walls are covered black and i can sense their closing in and i'm helpless to save myself  a painful hand encloses its agony and i know my screams are silent and i know my death is the same  my eyes are red from weeping and i can't win and no i can't win

      Well, I actually didn't spend any of my money at Walmart. I thought I'd stop by at goodwill, and then...I spent all my money. That sounds about right for me. If I got money, I'll spend it. I still didn't find my Pee-Chee folders...  Anyway, going to a show tonight. It should be goooood. Solo stuff is always pleasant.

      Someday things will be different. I swear it. I don't really know how else to explain it. I just want things to change from this so bad, but they aren't. No, not at all. They will though, someday.                          i love  you. you  know. more than anything. i hope  you  know. i would get the planet in its entirety for  you . if what  you  get isn't enough. and i would die for  you . if the world isn't enough. and i would spend my entire life in the most brutal and terrifying torture for  you . if death wasn't enough. and i'll let  you  take whatever  you  wish from what  you  abandon of me. if i'm not enough. if  love  isn't enough.

      That's how it goes I guess. People grow apart. I hope you won't try, because I can't let you close to me again. You know?

      I found that after keeping myself away forcefully for a couple days that hey, this isn't any of your guys' fault at all. So I'm gonna get IM back, and start answering the phone and all that stuff. I know I keep changing my mind around, but I guess that only shows just how "off" I've been lately. I went running today for the first in a long time. Maybe all I needed was some confidence.

      I said what you wanted to hear And what I wanted to say So I will take it back Are all the dishes intact? Let them be broken  It's easy to be Easy and free When it doesn't mean anything You remain selfless, cold and composed  You've done me no favor to call and be nice Telling me I can take anything I like You don't owe me to be so Polite

      I got rid of instant messenger, and I'm not making an effort to answer the phone anymore. I'm also getting rid of the "comments" option on this blog stuff. You probably won't be reading this anyway since you won't see the link in my now nonexistent profile. I know I said I'd talk to you if you wanted to talk, but hey I will, just hope someone else answers the phone, because I'm sick of running and diving for it.  You know what's fun? Riding the bus and reading a book with the windows down and the wind messing up your hair, and that's something I don't have to rely on anyone else for.  So all and all, I guess my brief moment of glee was, as I had been pondering, just temporary.  During last night, I thought to myself that maybe this is just now settling in. Crying spells and lack of sleep is just what I was missing. I guess that completes the emptiness right?  Here's a nice song I wrote for Elena during the past few days. It's probably one of the last happy things you'll see come out of me for a while I'm predicting.    righty   the grass was wet that night we found out as we layed on the ground stars were shining bright I could hardly make them out without the glasses I lost but I didn't need them  cause I could feel you and I could hear you breathing  when it was time to go we both knew that we didn't want to let this go you held me close at my door we said goodnight I knew sleep was coming easy  *I'll never forget that summer pretending like I was wasn't leaving you well I'm never leaving you and you never left*  we stood in the long line for your least favorite ride you begged me not to rock the cart for fear it'd fall apart at the top we were staring down at the crowd  and you told me how afraid you feel i was the only one you'd let take you on the ferris wheel  at the water's edge we talked about our lives so many things killing us from inside we said if nothing else we'll survive and we're gonna make it in this world  *and I'll never forget that summer pretending like I wasn't leaving you well I'm never leaving you and you never left  I'll never forget that summer pretending like I wasn't leaving you well I'm never leaving you and you never left me*         .maybe I am leaving.

      Nothing's changed. Not a damn fuckin thing. I hate being me. I really do. But if you wanna talk. I guess I won't turn you down. It's not like I've got anywhere else to go anyway. Ridiculous. Just plain ridiculous
