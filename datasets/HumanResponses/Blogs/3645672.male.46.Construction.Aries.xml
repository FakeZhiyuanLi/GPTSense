      Money Changers...  Lets go back all the way to day one regarding this issue...religious apartheid(sp?)... From day one and counting every day since then, more specifically every working day  since then, how many cases have come before the courts regarding fighting for freedom of religion as far as the kids go? For example I'm sure you have heard of the various cases that pertained to kids in schools wanting to be able to have  Bible studies on school property. There have been many of these. I'm sure there are cases that some of you have heard of over the past 40 years that have hinged on "students" rights to exemplify their religion via shirts they wear, buttons they wear, tracks they hand out and so on. In the past 40 years I believe it is safe to say that hundreds of cases regarding this whole issue have been tried by various attorneys before various courts throughout the nation.   In 40 years how much money do you think has been SPENT fighting this whole matter? How much money has been poured into the coffers of the goverment by individuals who have taken a stand for their religious convictions? How many dollars do you think have been poured into the government  coffers to debate the cases, to fight for the rights of students, to argue the merits of what should have been a regular right for kids across this nation? How many dollars do you think has been spent, more  specifically dumped into the coffers of the government?   Thousands of dollars? Hundreds of thousands of dollars? Millions of dollars?   Looks to me like maybe some institution that I will keep nameless has made quite a killing  off of our "right" to practice our religion freely, without the constraint of the law binding us down  and disgorging us of every dime we've  got! You think they aren't aware fo this fact? You think they don't  know they are profitting off of our RIGHT to freely practice our religion in our schools?   How much money do you think has been spent wrestling with this monster, this beast, this brutal taskmaster? At the end of the day...recall what the King said...  The love of money is the root of all kinds of evil... You tell me my web footed friends....   You tell me...  Do they have the right to do this to us? Do they have the right to do it to you or someone you love?  For over 40 years the very institution that told us it was illegal to have the Bible in our schools and prayer has made  a killing off of us and that blasphemously so. Is it possible, this is what they were after all along?   Recall the scripture that says...  I found as it were the riches of the people.... (key word there, riches, as in they would sell nearly their soul to keep this  in their midst...)  The passage goes on to say... "As one gathers eggs that are left in a field, so have I gathered to myself all the nations of the world, no one made a sound, not even a peep"...  They found as it were the riches of the people of America... As one gathers eggs that are left in a field, so have they milked the believers of  this nation dry for decades! And they know it...   I'm making a sound and it is much louder that a peep!!!   God is not mocked, He will not be deceived..neither must we... They milk us dry, they take all our hardearned dollars  and mock us and God to our faces. They pretend to care, when in reality they have found something so precious, so priceless, so  If you think this is too far fetched, contemplate again... This use to take place in the Temple is Israel during the days that Jesus was here. The rulers of the temple would severly overcharge the people who came to make sacrifice for their sins as the Law of God required. They would charge absorbident prices for doves and other acceptable animals earmarked for sacrifice...A sacrifice that was required by God, in order for the  families to make atonement for their sins. They would "tax" the souls of those people so much, they could barely pay the price of the sacrifice. In short, they were using their spiritual inner life to profit off of the people. Please remember... just as we Christians cherish what the Lord did for us, and value His Word, the Bible as a priceless treasure, the jews of long ago also treasured what God had given to them to be able to make atonement for their sins. This is an action that hinges  on an eternal spiritual inner need if you will...   For 40 years the People of God have been bled dry, paying absorbident prices just to keep intack a very intimate, private, fundamental action and practice in their lives. Don't fool yourselves, they are making millions... And does it cause you to wonder, to stop and think for a moment, why we as a nation are so very very very deep in debt? It's is creating a what amounts to a blackhole in our life as a nation. It is a sieve, a sink hole that is getting bigger and bigger all the time. I'm telling you, this vacuumm is similar to a tornado. Imagine the sheer velocity of a tornado? Imagine the inside of a tornado and how it is so violent, so powerful, so full of strength that it consumes everything in its path like a fire breathing dragon. Do we really think that God is going to bless a government that is on the one hand telling the people of America that they can no longer have the Bible in the schools as it use to be, nor be able to pray and they tell us that it is against the Constitution to do so. They make it sound so appealing, so righteous, so almost holy if you will. But behind closed doors it is altogether entirely different. They have a whole other motive as to why they did what they did  back in the 1960's. They created a situation where they knew down the road they could profit off of that "egg left in the field" and that beyond description. They knew... They had a plan, they pulled it off, they achieved their aim. And for 40 years they have bled Gods People dry. Mentally, emotionally, spiritually and financially. You tell me my web footed friends, what is going on?   See it has nothing to do with the Constitution in general. Specifically it does have something to do with a particular religions and more speicifically a "Christians" Constitution when it comes to something  that is so close to our hearts. At this time they have us by the heartstrings. They have us over a barrel. This is tantamount to highway robbery. Extortion even. Holding a "right" of ours hostage for the sake of their own gain.   I'm not saying all individuals involved in the courts of our nation are knowingly involved in this conduct. But I will say this at least. There are those among us who will bleed us dry. They will forever allow us to come before them and fight our case in court. Heck, even allowing us to win what appears to be a major victory. In reality, it is a battle in the big war. They will allow us to engage them for years, decades even. Forever holding out that carrot in front of our noses, enticing us to think if not believe that somehow maybe one day we will win the biggest battle of all, Gods Word back in our schools. But mark my words, they will hear case after case, engaging us in the process, appearing to care even. But they know behind closed doors what is really going on. So go ahead and spend your millions, that is what this is really all about and they knew it from day one. Spend our hard earned money, go before the justices, do it day after day after day...Until you have spent your entire lifes savings.   I feel sorry for the ACLJ... they fight the battles like good soldiers. Forever appearing before the "law of the land"... groveling even if you will, hoping to get the courts to pass a verdict in the favor of their client. ACLJ, what are you doing?  They are making fools out of you. This is insane. They are bleeding you dry Mr. Sekulow. Go ahead fight the good fight, but I promise you, you will never ultimately get the prize, not when you are going before the "institution" that pulled a fast one on our faith and  to this day have made millions off of us. Its about money folks. Plain and simple...MONEY... What a treacherous act against the people of this nation. What a treacherous act against the children of our land. What a disgrace.   Jesus went in and cleared out the temple. He turned over the money tables. He kicked out the money changers. He said.... This house is to be a house of prayer, but you have turned it into a den of robbers and thieves...  Our government, more specifically the judicial branch was at one time founded upon the gospel of Jesus Christ. So much so that at the end of a trial a minister would be called in to pray over the jury, imploring God to enable them to rightfully judge the case. At times when an individual was prosecuted and found guilty of the crime of murder, the judge in the courtroom would present to the individual the gospel. Instructing him or her of thier spiritual condition, directing them to understand  that in the condition they were in at the time, they were in no wise prepared for eternity. And today, what do we have... what do we have...  Please understand something here, an entire generation has passed since this whole thing first began. There are many people now working in the judicial institutions around the nation that were not around when it all began. Today they are only participating in something that was created long ago. They go to work and do their job. That is all they do. They have no idea what was really going on back in the 60's. Today in the judicial instituion there are many people there who have been raised to believe that it is "Unconstitutional"  for the Bible to be in our schools as it was before it was so viciously removed around the middle of the last century. They know nothing else. To them, what they do is natural, the law if you will. And to them they see nothing wrong with what they do.   Just as when the Soviet Union fell, there were things leftover from that whole cold war period that we as a people have had to process mentally and toss upon the ash heap of history... One day this villanous act will be exposed by God and when it is, this whole time of darkness in our land will be relagated to the ash heap of history. Remember, the communists had many goals to destroy America from within, removing the Bible and prayer were a couple of them. At this time we are experiencing what they did what seems like another lifetime ago. Get ready for the Big Show, God is not mocked, man does reap what he sows. Examine in detail what started in the 60's regarding our Gods Word. The steps that were taken no doubt behind closed doors to ultimately pull off their coup d'etat... Just as they systematically, line upon line, increment by increment, thought by thought, ultimately removed our beloved nations identity and that so brutally, they will in the proper time, by the Hand of God, experience the same result against what they did to "ALL" of us... Don't fool yourselves... don't forget the passage in our Fathers Word where He made it known to the Children of Israel that they would never enter into His rest, and after ONE generation died in the wilderness...(dear God, redeem the generation that was lost these past 40 years... Redeem Father, recapture what is rightfully yours... They belong to you!!!) the next generation entered into the promised land. (Please, defer from pointing out to me the other issues regarding what that second generation ultimately did, I am well aware of it)... The second generation entered the promised land... A precedent was set by the God of all creation... God does not allow a second generation to perish in the wilderness... The precedent is there, just trust God and believe... This is something that we believers should not treat with indifference... We should not turn a blind eye to it...simply cuz we are supposedly in the end times.... That is a slight to your Father in Heaven and to His Son...Jesus gave His life for many reasons, one of which was so that all of us could have what we call the Bible available to us so we can grow in the Lord... Is that something to take lightly? 40 or so years ago, the powers that be didn't take it lightly...They found the riches of Gods people and to this day have exploited it to NO END!   In regards to that passage about the individual finding as it were the riches of the people... If he "found" that 'something'..it means he was looking for it, actively looking for it and that with a very treacherous motive.  Looking for a way to control the people, to subject them to his whims, his desires, his appetite if you will.   Will the Bible ever be restored to our schools? Not without God supernaturally intervening to reverse what was done. There is just TOO much money to be made off of this whole thing... Kind of like the war on drugs... think about it..  OK, lets look at what took place on 9-11-2001, because I believe it is a sign to this nation. Lets pull back if you will and observe the whole event from a perspective that would be tantamount to outter space...I'm talking about a birds eye view here... Overall, in the history of a nation many things take place that are watersheds in the lifespan of a nation. Since it is a inate known fact that America was birthed by God, I believe it is safe to say that those two towers that came crashing down represent something overall if you will regarding the overall identity of the nation. Something happened that day on 911 that was beyond just an attack. I believe it is safe to say that to God what they did to His Word in the 60's is tantamount to what it was like when the two towers came down.... I refer to the imagery here my web footed friends... A sign if you will.... Those towers overall represented something spiritually speaking... I don't believe the best years of our nation are behind us. I believe God is preparing to do something NEW in our land. This nation was indeed birthed by God, for a reason, she has a destiny, her own personal destiny and that for a specific reason to God... I don't think we have gotten anywhere close to comprehending just exactly what it is that God had planned for the USA from the outset. Look at how fast we progressed. Look at what we have achieved. There are nations that have been around for thousands of years and they still barely have running water...   Please, lets scan the horizon, not for the rapture, not for the end times... Can any of you prove it is the end times...I mean so much so that you would be willing to buy stock based upon your personal opinion if you will? Remember, for a very long time now there has been a communist force at work in America, working overtime to destroy her from within. It has created an atmosphere of crime, hate, violence, spiritual starvation and so on and that intentionally. They had a plan and at this time they are most assuredly moving forward with it. I recall what a president once said about America.... "America is about going shopping.." Interesting would you say? Going shopping? On the contrary...America is about finding its way out of this mess and once again glorifying God in her midst.... That is what America is ultimately about. And believe me, my God and your God will see this nation through to that safe harbor. I'm not going to climb up on my roof in anticipation of the rapture...I'm gonna keep my eyes peeled on Washington DC and all points in between... Something is up, altho 911 on the surface appears so brutal, so vicious, so chilling even, I believe it is a sign to us... The imagey just cannot escape my gaze... Can any of you discern with the Lords help, just exactly what those two towers represent? I wonder who was really behind building those two temples back then... They were built in the 60's. Could it be that ultimately they were a kind of edifice or a kind of statue if you will...along the lines of the Washington monument, declaring victory, communist victory if you will....

      Well here it is folks.... I just hope I can post to it in the coming days... As I stated earlier I am having to move and it will be awhile before I can get a phone hooked up. Guess maybe I will have to make a trip to the library to post some thoughts. Some of you have mentioned that my posts are very thought provoking. That is my intention, but on a larger scale I hope to provoke you to engage in a conversation that helps to unravel this whole coverup or coup if you will. If for nothing other than to get things straightened out in our own minds.   I'm also interested in what you see as being the angle to all of this. I don't want to provoke you to thinking simply to tickle your fancy. I feel that these are some very serious issues that need to be addressed. And when we can get to the bottom of all of it, even with a few people only engaging in getting to the truth in this whole nightmare, don't be surprised if you find yourself stumbling across someone who inquires about what we are examining. It all starts with a seed. Out of the seed the lie can be reversed. A handful of people who come to the truth in all of this, can in fact with the Lords help turn the lie around. I will say it to enable all of us to understand what I am hammerring away here about... In America, it is NOT Unconstitutional for the Bible to be read in our schools nor for the kids to be led in a prayer before the day begins. I repeat, it is NOT unconstitutional....Period... God has said to not dispise small beginnings... Remember, we the people are the leaders in America, not the other way around. And the truth can begin in a very small core... Not for the sake of gaining some kind of recognition, but simply for the sake of the truth being exposed. To this day Washington DC continues to cover up the lie and the root cause behind why this agregious act was perpetrated against the people of the United States of America. I wonder sometimes if they wanted to insite a rebellion or a revolution. I just wonder... Be that as it may, lets saddle up and see what the Lord reveals. Someone somewhere has got to be willing to take the bull by the horns and get to the bottom of this. I'm game... are you?
