      Movies    I went to the Movies last night.  We do not go very much anyway.  We saw Minority Report and I thought that it was very good.  As I said we do not go to many movies because they are so expensive these days.  I highly reccomend this movie if you want to see a good movie out now

         Well Here I am posting  on this blog again.  My husbnads blog is down.  Kind of  a  crazy story but the site that he uses is lost their colocation contract due to a distributed denial of service attack.  How fun is that anyway, I think it is kind of messed up if you know what I mean.

        I Love  urlLink this  movie.  As I have said before I also like 80's music and the  urlLink soundtrack  is full of 80's music.  urlLink Art  thinks  that I am a nut job for liking 80's music.   urlLink Adam Sandler  is hysterical in this movie and so is  urlLink Steve Buscemi

       urlLink Footloose (1984)    I am sitting here changing the channel on TV and guess what is on cmtv thats right footloose.  It is hard to believe that this movie came out 20 yrs ago.   Anyway as I was looking on  urlLink imdb.com  I see that there is supposed to be a  urlLink remake of this movie  and it is from the producers of Chicago.  Nothing has been updated on imdb since last year about this.   Anyway I love the music from the movie and am happy to hear that there will be a remake where the actors do their own singing and dancing that is what I liked about  urlLink Chicago.      Speaking of 20 yrs ago it is hard to believe that  urlLink this show  is 20 years old.          Anyway, as I was driving home from work this afternoon I decided that I would not leave the house once I got home but I really wanted a tomato sandwich but we had no bread and no tomatoes so I went to Hyvee and bought bread and 2 tomatoes.   Boy was that sandwich good.   Art thinks that a sandwich should have meat on it.  Anyway, who thinks that I am crazy because I wanted to eat a tomato sandwich for dinner.

          urlLink King Arthur (2004)    This movie looks like it might be pretty good.   Art and I do not pay to see many movies at the theatre, but King Arthur looks like it might be worth going to a matinee sometime.

         Art and I went to see  urlLink this  movie this afternoon.  It was an interesting movie.  I enjoyed it more than I thought that I would.  You learn quiet a bit about what happened after 9/11. If you are a supporter of President Bush you may not like the film as it makes President Bush look pretty bad.       Art and I just started watching  urlLink this movie  a few moments ago.  I have seen it numerous times but I just love  urlLink Nicolas Cage.   He is one of my favorite actors.   urlLink Sean Connery  is not bad looking either.

         I was listening to a  urlLink local country station  and  urlLink this song was playing.   It sounded remotely familiar so I came home and looked it up and to my surprise  urlLink John Denver  originally did this song.  Well as soon as heard the tune I knew the name of the song and all the words. It amazes me how I can't remember what I did 5 minutes ago but I can remember lyrics to a song that was originally released 30 yrs ago.  No wonder Art calls me the fountain of useless knowledge. The version that I heard today was done by  urlLink Billy Dean.    I have never been one to like covers of older songs but I really liked Billy Dean's version.   I know a geek that likes country music is not very common.

          Art and I rented  urlLink this movie  the other night.  It was a pretty good flick.   urlLink Johnny Depp  makes a good pirate in the movie.  I remember when he was on  urlLink 21 Jump Street.   The show was one of the first to be on the  urlLink fox network.

         Well here I am wanting to rant about mt and how it gets spammed.  We have been unable to blog due to reasons that are being worked out as we speak.  It is hard to believe that June has come and gone so quickly.  We went to a cookout last weekend with Art's coworkers in Port Byron IL.  I met a few people who I had not before.  We had a good time.  They all asked why he didn't have  urlLink his new toy  with him.  I know I have said it before we are to geeky for our own good.
