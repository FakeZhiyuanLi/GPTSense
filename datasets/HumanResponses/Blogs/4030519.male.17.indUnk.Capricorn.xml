      &nbsp;Josh i mena what was his problem tonight... i mena if he ever got off of the meat ball sub thing we might not have a reason to tell him to stfu.. if u know what i mean.. I think i speek for all the guys who were there ... i wanted to get a fuking pipe and bash his head in ... i guess i should tell u gusy the full story ... ok it starts out as a good night I mena it was a going away party.. and they are ualy sad( although i think she is not acctuly leaving the crountry yet...) but neway we were all in high spirits ... I mena when u have dave slocum everything is happy .. he is a walking comidian.. so ya it was good ... and no for the record he did not make any religous jokes tonight. now like i said this is the slow&nbsp; part nothing realy exiting happend .. julia(my sister) and hanna went to starbucks to get coffey for everyone.. so it was sorta slow but then josh( the asswhole) took slocums necklas( cheap lanyard with work beads althought he loves it so :)] so josh takes it and i thought he was playing around like he would give it back .. but no he grabed dave and put him into a hand lock ( oo btw josh has a hard cast on his right hand) and like drags him (or triesto ) to the front steps then slocum tries to push carlan off of him and josh realesses his lockand punches him in da back .. now if u look at his arm it looks like&nbsp; dave was playing paint ball with some biggg ass&nbsp; paint balls its a hugh mark on his arm and back (allthough he says not).. then it was boring for a while longer we played card for awhile (side note josh was wondering and laughing his ass off over a fuking meat ball sub i mean like once or twice is&nbsp; ok but like ten or twelve times its fuking anoyoing specaly since i work at subway...) so then finaly dave and julia leave alittle earlier so they can talk since they have had no time to talk all evening.. so once they leave its quiet and&nbsp; josh looks angry( wich in my opoin is to get attention).. and every one( but me) askes whats wrong??, hes like i wana go home nowww.. we were like ok heres the phone... then he was like u know whats fuked up dave can make fun of my god( what not like its not other ppls god) and i cant talk about a meat ball sub..( i wanted to say so much but i contaned myself).. and then he started talking shit about dave..(may i add that he waited till dave leaft be for he started talking shit) so at this point my mom comes and picks me up and i am home . so ya josh has to have problems i swere he is a walking time bomb stay clear of him... ok on a liter note i know it says the post time is 12:00 it now is 12:21 and i will say i am glad i wasted this much time getting this shit off my chest ...ok all peace out and word to ya mother
