      So, I went to my cousins house in Peoria (it's in Illinois). Yeah, that was fun.  We arrived on the doorstep of a house vaguely resembling a castle.  Upon our arrival we were greeted by a crazy woman named Amy, who claimed to be my cousin... not the cousin I remember.. *shakes fist angrily. Our arrival time was exactly 2:34 p.m. central time zone.(The clock in our car struck 2:34 as we pulled into the driveway, and we have the most precise clock known to mankind.)  Upon arrival, this character, who I will refer to as Amy, showed us through her house and pointed out the problems that we would have to fix while we were there.  My dad made a list of stuff he needed as she pointed stuff out.  After the tour, I sat down in the living room and played the guitar that was waiting to be played.  I played that shit up... 'cept it was wildly out of tune.  I had to curb my anger and refrain from bitch slapping that guitar.  I calmly searched for a tuner because unlike Karthik, I don't have the eyes of a fox and cannot tune it by ear.  Maybe it's because the bitch never showed me how to tune w/ harmonics.  Well, I'll show that foreign kid...  I didn't find one and by the time I was tired of looking and bugging amy to find it, those Kray Z kidz(my parents, amy, and my older brother were ready to go to lowes.  Lowes was pretty boring until we started looking at the lights.  We were looking at some recessed lights for amy's kitchen when some dude, with annoyingly blonde hair and a lisp came up in our grill and asked if he could help us.(for future reference I will refer to him as Mr. Garrison)  My dad was looking at some lights and couldn't figure out how they attatched to the ceiling so he asked Garrison how they attatch to the ceiling.  Mr. Garrison proceded to take the light from my dad, lift it above his head so the light part was pointing down, and say, "It goes in like this."  Well, thanks, jackass, you've been a real fucking help.  We got kicks outta that one for the rest of the night. We returned at a quarter after five.  I played guitar for about 15 minutes before Tim came home...  Then, I played for 45 more.  Then I went to sleep and ate cookies.    Sunday was Kray Z.  On Sunday, My dad and Tim finished up a electric project and we went to play frisbee golf... We stopped by a sporting goods store to buy the frisbees for the game and on our way out we heard a tornado siren.  The weather didn't seem to be too bad so we headed over to the course.  We played about 12 holes with out any incident, but when we got the the 13th. the rain started coming down harder and harder.  It was pouring by the time we finished the hole so we started running back to the car.  We all ended up thoroughly soaked by the time we ran the mile back to the car.  We arrived home to find Amy and my mother in the basement heeding the tornado warnings.  They yelled at us saying they were scared shitless and all that jazz.  Then today was pretty boring, but I did get a couple good hours of guitar playing in...

      Well, I had to expect it, being that I was going to a Revival.  Revive this bitch *grabs sack*.  Well, I went to a revival the other day, lemme tell you all about it Kidz.  First of all, I got there like ten minutes early and no one was there.  About 15 minutes after I got there Amber showed up and we talked about meteors that will eventually turn into fish.  Then three other Kraay Z Kidz showed up.  Sommer, Jessie, and Chadd rolled up in an escalade(not really,i just thought it would sound cooler).  Then Chad got there and went inside where all the old people were.  We went to the back and sat on the roof and those Kraay Z Kidz enjoyed a smoke while I told a joke.  So anyway, we had to put it out before we were done cause some old person came to the back of the building.  That was interesting.  We then decided it was our time to join the old people.  Upon picking a couple seats in the back, we discovered that we were not wanted.... in the back at least.  Those bitches made us sit in the front...  The lecturer was fucking insane.  He told all these jokes.  There was one especially funny one.  It went something like this, "The lord, Jesus Christ is coming back."  I laughed my ass off, silently of course, being that it wasn't one of those jokes that you're supposed to laugh at.  Usually after a lame joke(the type that is supposed to draw laughs) he would proclaim, "Can I get an amen brother?" to break the akward silence.  Then some old jackass in the back never failed to support the jerk up front and say "Amen, Bro."  No, you can't, you stupid piece of shit.  You've been saying stupid shit all day and getting amen's all fucking day.  I'm not going to give you one just because you're an asshole and told a lame joke.  Fuck I wish I had the crickets chirping sound effect.  That would have been priceless.  By the way, what is with old men's laughs.  Is it something that comes w/ age or something?  I've tried and tried to laugh like an old man, but it just doesn't work.  Molemonkey can laugh like an old man though...  but he doesn't count because he's got a chess piece in his mouth.  Apparently the belly laugh is one of those things you get when you turn 65.  Then during closing he asked all of us sinners to bow our heads, which I did for fear of looking like a jackass.  He then told us sinners to raise our right hand and ask the "lord" for forgiveness.  I nearly busted out laughing as I nearly said "FUCK YOU, YOU OLD FUCK."  Of course neither happened but the thought was there.  What a fucktard that man was.  Then, while everybody else had raised their hand and did their voodoo shit or whatever I still hadn't done it because I don't need forgiveness from some old man in the sky.  The old kid in front kept giving somewhat subtle hints that I should raise my hand.  He said stuff like, "Will the male teengaer with long hair in front please raise his right hand."  Then after a moment of akward silence he would give more hints like, "You know who you are.  About 6' tall and 140#'s.  Hazle eyes and a Kurt Cobain shirt.  You're wearing blue jeans."  "Well, thanks jackass, apparently even though I knew you were talking about me, you had to fully describe me.(slight exageration)  I was just too busy suppressing the fucking laughter to listen to you ramble on about forgiveness and all that other bullshit."

      I saw this last night w/ will and niki.  Well... at least I saw parts of it.  We got slightly intoxicated before the movie so we had a short attention span, then half way through the movie we went out smoke (Double the buzz)and luckily Dru and Matt were working so they let us back in.  We then went back and joined Niki for the rest of the movie which from what I saw was moderately funny.  It was basically just a movie full of parodies.  Of course, it had a cliche hollywood ending.  "No Shrek, I want to be with the ogre i married."  That ending could be seen as I saw it though.  Probably just another thing they were doing as a parody of cratacular hollywood ending movies.

      This movie sucked hardcore.  It had about the joined sucking power of a Hoover and 3 Vietnamese whores.  First of all, it was just a generic storyline(plot).  The good guy does something completely unrelated to the story to show his character.  He then goes to talk to his boss who gives him the important mission that is going to take two hours to complete compared to the 7 minutes it took to complete the opening mission.(sounding like James Bond to any of you?).  Aparrently they didnt' even want to create any original characters either.  They just took some comic book/video game characters and put them in the generic storyline with some flashy graphics(to impress the youngins.) and dialogue full of cliches.  The whole damn movie was a cliche.  Sooo... in general, Van Helsing sucked.

      Yeah, Amber and I stole the handshake that Jack Black and the uncool kid in School of Rock did.  Yeah, we stole it, so fuck us.  At least we're cool enough to have a handshake, fuckers.

      The title is completely irrelevant but this is the story is about a cashier of an  undisclosed ethnic background.  I traveled to Michigan City today and stopped at a Pizza Hut Express/Taco Bell where I ordered a number 2 w/ cheese and cinnamon sticks.(Mexican Pizza)  It ended up being something like $5 but that's irrelevant.  The thing is when I went back up the get more cinnamon sticks.  The total was 94 cents.  The problem was the cashier of an undisclosed ethnic background told me it was 94 cent.  I heard what she said but I, being the jackass that I am, asked her what she said.  she said, "That'll be 94 cent."  I asked again, "What did you say?"  She replied, "94 cent," Realizing it was a lost cause, I just gave the cashier of an undisclosed ethnic background a dolla dolla bill.  she then said, "6 cent will be your change."  Oh man, I was about to jump up on the counter, pull my pants down, and declare my independence.  Luckily for the world I did not.

      ok, as always Tim and I secret agented throught the computer lab after lunch.  They never saw it coming.  I got the white and the fire for next friday and General Frye should be getting the green soon.  Funny story about Design.  Matt yelled something about mary ja wana really loud and Whitie was like, "Matt, What was that"  Matt replied, "I don't know it just came out."  I then asked matt, "Young man, do you kiss your mother with that mouth." "Yes," he replied.  I seeing this situation for what it really was said, "Hey everybody, Matt kisses his mom.  Throw some pencils at him."  No one threw pencils, but man, i could feel the tension building.  Matt was like the volcano that was ready to explode.  During break time, General Tim and I were about to dump the trash can in the stall Matt was in and everything was set up perfectly, but Whitie had to walk in and bust that shit up.  Then, in an effort to put the blame on matt, I yelled, "Don't you go wild at that Van Halen concert young man."  "Yessir," matt replied.  The interesting part of the day really started at like 3 though.  Amber and I were sitting, waiting for Kyle to get back from the library when amber started cleaning out her book bag.  She had some caffine pills.  I took two.  When I started to feel the effects of it, I decided to counter it with some chill pills.(prozac)  You could say, as Trent Reznor did, "Didn't turn out the way you wanted it to? Did it?"  Well, no in fact it did not.  It just gave me a really bad headache and made me dizzy as fuck.  We then travelled to Chad's house where we watched School of Rock (awesome movie).  That got over at like 5:30, which is when Amber's mom came.  Chad had left so it was just Kyle, Amber, and me.  Well, amber and I went upstairs to talk and Amber's mom knocked and came in.  She seemed kind of pissed and was doing some Charlie Brown detective shit.  We talked to her for about five minutes before she asked where Kyle was and why he had'nt come up yet.  So we called kyle up and he asked why and Amber's mom is like, "I just wanted to make sure you're dressed."  (Kyle and Amber are going out and it was just me kyle and amber there.)  Kyle came up, with his clothes on and she's like, ok, i'm going to get something to eat.  So she left and soon after Chad came home.  Chad and all the other characters drove out to the grange.  With no room in that car, I just decided to ride w/ Kyle.  Kyle had to pick shannah up so we drove out to Kesling Park.  We arrived at 6 and I had to take a mad yes(family guy reference)... So, I went into the area where they collect body waste and emptied my bladder.  We then walked over to the soccer fields to cheer Shannah on. We had about a half hour until the practice was over.)  So, we sat and watched those kids play soccer.  Shannah took some dude out, it was pretty kickass.  When that was over the headache from the mixed pills had worn about worn off.  We drove out to the grange where I took the pain killer that I had also gotten from Amber's backpack.  That fucker sucked, it's still making me shake and shit.  That's all I want to write now, so whateva, i do what i want

      By popular demand, I decided to update my site today.  Today sucked.  Except lunch.  We found out that molemonkeys chesspiece tooth is really a decoy and it doesn't actually give him super chess powers.  We super homie styled Fattony.  Yep, I'm a jackass.  I'm talking to my cousin's ex-girlfriend on the phone.  Sorry to disapoint you folk, but i don't have much to say today

      A rather uneventful day... except for lunch, of course.  Lunch is never boring though so that hardly counts.  Biology was also semi-amusing.  Story Time...  So I walk into biology as I always do, and this strange man grabbed me by the throat and threw me around the room... luckily with my secret agent powers I was able to escape his prying gaze.  It turns out it was just Spitz and his grabbing my neck was merely a figment of my imagination.  so as usual, I gave him the thumbs up.  Half way through the class I asked him if he's ever heard the story about the missing turnip... and he said yes...  Questions were running through my head:  was it in a message from god?  Was he the real creator of the turnip trilogy?  Is the turnip a figment of my imagination and he's bluffing?  To test the latest question I asked him to tell me the story, to which he replied, "You go first."  "I know it I just wanna see if you know it I replied,"  I said.  This argument went on in typical kindergarden fashion for years... or was it just a few seconds?  Ya Neva Know.  Sooo... eventually I cracked and told him the story and he told me that General Frye told him years ago(well, actually it was just days)  "GENERAL FRYE'S IN YOUR CLASS!"  I exclaimed.  He said, "no, Tim Frye is in my class."  That was the end of that.  note: exageration may occur in the above tale

      So, I went to a wedding reception today to work as a caterer dude and let me just say AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.  So, first we were just fucking around and there was really nothing to do so Amber and I went out and sat in her mom's car until her mom yelled at us and told us "that we weren't being paid to sit in a car."  We then went inside, where, as predicted, there was nothing for us to do.  So apparently we were being paid to stand around doing nothing, but it is forbidden to sit in a car and do nothing.  So after standing around for a while doing nothing the reception started and we started serving food to people.  I got the baked beens, which were at the back which means when people got to me of course there was either only one spot or no spots left on their plates.  Apparently some of them still needed to tell me where to put it.  "Put it right there buddy."  I'm thinking, "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, you are a jackass.  Where the fuck else would I put the damn beans."  Then there were the people who tried to get special orders.  "Hey little man, can you get some of the dry beans and some of the wetter ones and mix them together for me."  "Ahhhhhhh, fuck you people, this is a fucking wedding reception.  I'm not gonna mix your fucking this with your that."  Then there are the people that don't understand that you only get half the beans that are on the spoon cause they get stuck so don't give me shit.  "Oh, little boy, I don't want that many beans."   Ahhhhhhh FUCK YOU.  The positive side though is, I got a few small cups of special jello and $20.  Then there are always gonna be the people who after I said "Would you like some baked beans?"  They say "I don't want any beans."  Isn't a simple no enough.  Ahhh, I have to serve about 85 more people you don't need to tell me the whole fucking story.  Well, now that that's out there.  I must seem like a bitter person.  I'm really not, incompetence just really bugs me.  Not to mention, the number of people who had to tell me it's all going to the same place any way.  The first time it was pretty funny cause this old lady put barbecue sauce on her mashed potatoes because she thought it was gravy.  (I'm not gonna go into the fundemental differences of gravy and barbecue sauce.)  So, anyway, she put the barbecue sauce on her potatoes and I couldn't hold back the laughter.  Unfortunately, someone else told her that it wasn't gravy before she ate it.  Man, can you imagine what the look on her face woulda been like if she had eaten those potatoes thinkin they had gravy on them.  That's not the point though, the point is she started a chain reaction of "It's all going to the same place"  People around the world were saying it.

      I don't remember what context I said this in but apparently people thought it was pretty funny.  'This is a long and perilous journey I am venturing on, and I may not make it back alive, but if I am back in one piece there will be hell to pay.  Not one child unraped, one taxpayer dodging deadlines, not one fisherman sticking his poll in the water.'

      The Missing Turnip I  There once was a turnip named Jimbo.  One day a gopher took the turnip and some cracker yelled "Ahhhhhhh, The Turnip is Missing"  That cracka sunnovabitch went looking for the missing turnip, but he didn't know that the gopher left some of the turnips seeds so a new one grew and the missing turnip turned up.  by,  General Tim and Grand Masta Brad  The Missing Turnip II  Once upon a time, there was a turnip.  It was missing because a bird ate it, but the bird pooped out the seeds and a new one grew so the missing turnip turned up.  General Frye and Grand Masta Brad   The Missing Turnip pt. 3  Once there was a turnip and a sumo wrestler sat on it and the turnip disappeared into his crack.  Then the fat guy farted and the turnip shot out and hit a 65 year old man in the face.  The turnip went right down the dudes throat and out his asshole so the missing turnip turned up.

      This is the section where I post interesting shit that happens each day.  The first post will have four in it because I posted these days ago on the other site, but every subsequent day will have it's own post.  5/10/04  My path to world domination is clear and now I will travel the road starting, of course, with giving molemonkey a purple bananna.  Today after school I purchased eight banannas of which seven remain.  I had to eat one on the way home.  The bananna of molemonkey's doom has been painted, but having run out of purple paint, I filled the rest in with red.  He'll never notice.  Tomorrow at 10:11 I will be released from my second hour and will immediately meet up with General Tim.  General Tim and I will then proceed to the cafeteria where we will find molemonkey telling lame jokes and laughing like an old man.  We will set the purple bananna in front of him and laugh at him old man style.    5/11/04  FUUUCK... Stupid POS me, I already wrote this once, but I forgot to save it before I exited so here goes...  Today, as planned, I brought the purple bananna to school.  Also as planned, I met up with General Frye after second hour and we began our journey to the cafetorium, army crawling through the computer lab on the way.  I showed General Tim the bananna and after making sure the coast was clear, I rolled into the cafeteria and began walking over to the table which was occupied by Molemonkey and his smelly friends.  I said, "Molemonkey, you're my best friend in the whole wide world and I just want to give you this."  I then placed the bananna on the table in front of him in a firm, but not aggressive manner.  "PSHdfFUCKDDFKJLUBRAD," he replied, and naturally, hearing my name, I was interested, so I asked "What's that?"  He picked up the bananna and threw it at me striking me in the face.  Upon contact, the bananna broke slightly and some of the bananna slushie sexually violated my nose.  Tim and I laughed like old men off their rockers, mocking Molemonkeys old man laugh.  We then took the bananna over to Agent Cody Banks (our secret friend) and presented it in the same fashion to him.  As we were leaving the bananna struck General Frye in the back of the head.  We immediately fell to the ground laughing like old men off their rockers.  Mr. Birkholtz then told us to go back to our seats.  We went back to the table and sat down.  With the bananna still in our possession we felt we needed to do something with it.  We squeezed the contents of the bananna peel onto a piece of bread and put another piece of bread on top of it effectively creating a banana slushie sandwich.  Our initial plan was to throw the sandwich at Matt Moore in the bathroom during halftime of design.  That plan quickly went down the shitter so I just threw the sandwich at General Tim later on during design.     Oh yeah...  Sara thinks I called her a whore.  Damn you Will...      5/12/04  Well, today was interesting.           The answer is no.  I will not expand upon that           5/13/04  Another interesting day.  I think I'll tell you folk though, cause you're just cool like that.  So it started off normal (fuck that's the lamest thing i've ever written, doesn't that just sound like the beginning of a tale where the hero of the story is riding his donkey to school and is suddenly thrown off and fucked in the ass by the donkey... oh, well, what can ya do?)  Well, before I was rudely interupted by myself, I was saying, it started off as a normal day, I went to the cafeteria in the morning to talk to the ever conceited, but always hilarious Nate.  I was talkin for a while when a sudden urge to throw a milk at him struck, lucky for me I didn't have a milk, that bitch woulda been dead.  That's the whole fucking morning for you.  I hope you're happy.  Oh, and I had to type out like 3 fuckin memos, two business letters, a report, and 2 tables in keyboardin.  Blow me, Mr. Heath.  Lunch was good fun again.  Like always, we annoyed the shit out of Molemonkey aka Check Mate.(funny story about that.  One of his teeth looks like a rook from a chess set.)  During lunch Desiree aka nipple tooth said Jimmy was hot.  Of course we knew she meant he was physically appealing, but being the jackasses that we are, we took it literally and pursued the truth.  Is Jimmy running a fever?  Luckily for Jimmy, we came across General Frye's secret friend, Nolan, and he took the responsibility of checking Jimmy's body temp.  We found out that nipple tooth was right, Jimmy did indeed have a fever.  Being the good friends that we are we told Mr. White that Jimmy was running a fever and he being the crazy old man that he is told us to shut up and get to work.  We decided to take matters into our own hands, which is why, we will be bringing a wet wash cloth and an icebag to help Jimmy get rid of his fever.  And.... Nate and I got served today in gym.  First, we lost to Lauren and Courtney on account of Nate being whipped by every hot girl he knows and partially because of some sketchy score keeping.  Then Lisa and Christina (I think that's her name) beat us cause we suck.  So... yeah.... We got served up something major.              5/14/04  Today was very successful.  I went to Al's with Soda this morning and bought a dozen banannas.  General Tim found someone to supply the Green and the White and I have the Fire so next Friday is fixin to be good.  I scored five goals when we played soccer while everybody was staring at my perfect ass.  Jesus scored two goals(I had to share to glory before i crucified him)  I went completely secret agent on Spitz.  He never saw it coming.  I had a bananna hidden in the front pocket of my shirt and as I went under the desk to get the pencil I "accidentially" dropped on the floor I swiftly ducked out of view and sat down there for five minutes while I ate my bananna.  I ate six banannas today and some whore faced kid named travis told me I could die if I ate too many.  Some shit about a calcium OD. General Tim and I definitely army crawled throught the computer lab after lunch and no one saw us.  Those bitches are still looking for the person that stole the kleenex box last week.  Of course we made fun of Molemonkey/Check Mate/Old Man (all one person).  "Bitch, I'll grab your ass," he threatened.  I being scared by the prospect of Molemonkey grabbing my ass, sat down and did the "Chuckle, Chuckle, Chuckle, Giggle, Giggle, Giggle, Guffaw Guffaw, Guffaw" old man laugh.  Then this Josh kid said he was going to beat the shit out of us.(General Tim and Me)  I then proceeded to the checkout(lunchline) where they questioned me about my bag of banannas and the bananna in my front pocet, to which I answered "Buyer Beware," and whipped out my proof of purchase(from al's) all in one swift motion and continued "I have already exchanged three notes for theese banannas and the cashier was the one that likes Led Zeppelin,(I think) so she's like, "Ohh, brad, I'm so sorry," to which I answered "Oh, but are you really?"  I then walked away giving her no time to reply.  I also saw an interesting fight as I entered the cafeteria.  I saw this kid stand up and hit another kid in the face and dump the kid's tray on him, then he just sat back down like nothing happened.  The funny thing is the kid just took it.  He picked his burger, milk, and fries up off the floor and sat down and ate.  I'm a failiure to all of mankind.  Well, actually, Nolan's the failiure.  He didn't bring a bib, ice pack, or wash cloth for Jimmy, all items which he claimed the responsibility of bringing.  Jimmy's still got a fever.  I think we might have to egg Nolan's face while he's sleeping.  It's ok Nolan, I think we can still be secret friends... dun dun dun

      The Story Behind My Site   Well, the story about this site really is funny.  You see, one day I was playing baseball with Sammy Sosa and I said "You steroid pumpin, wife beating piece of shit."  He told me in a funny accent that has yet to disappear, "Me does it for ve basevball."  I said, "So the war is on, now I'm going to have to create a web page to tell this story." (Note that this information could very well be a lie, but I'm not going to just come out and say that.  That'd take away from the suspense.  I cannot be held responsible for my actions.)  So that's how this website came about... or is it?  Three years later,(today) I remembered this strange encounter with a wife beater and I said "Dog gonnit(I don't really say that in real life.  It just adds to the effect of the memory), I never made that web site."  So I got off the phone and made up a new song that went a little like this, "I've gotta write a story, oh yeah, i've got write a story about a wife beater."  Sooo... I got out of the car I was in,which apparently was still moving) jumped on top of a tall man's head, took my pants off and declared my independence from The US of A.  I made my own country called Utopia and lived happily ever after.  Unfortunately, being the kind of person who isn't content with sappy Hollywood endings, I married an Ass and contracted AIDS, which killed me soon after, bringing me to my reincarnation, which will be discussed later.  I decided today, to move my shit because in two days my other site will have a banner and annoying popups just because I'm not willing to pay to keep them from doing that shit.  The main reason though, is that other site was too goddamn restrictive.  the bitch had all the templates layed out for me and wouldn't let me move shit around or create new shit.

      CANADA, you're mine.  As a few of my colleagues already know back in the late 80's I began work on a method of mind controll that would give me the ability to make others conform to my beliefs or the way in which I wanted them to act.  I began my mission on a man named William Clinton aka Bill Clinton (or as I will to refer to him Dixie Crack Clinton.) (I've gotta give Zach De La Rocha props for Dixie Crack Clinton.)  As many of my colleague already knew, the thought process I put into his head was communism.  Unfortunately, my expieriment was in the shitter before it started because my colleagues didn't tell me that Dixie Crack Clinton was already a communist.  With that in the shitter, I decided to give up for a while, and now over a decade later I will try again.  This time Canada will be the victim.

      As you probably already know, my name is Brad.  Grand Masta Brad, King Joseph, and Asshole are all acceptable too, as they are the names given to me by my peers.  Will wants to know what happened to B to the Rad.  Umm... well, that sorta faded out, but I suppose you could still call me that if you would like.  I just wanted to take this oppurtunity to give a shout out to General Tim.  Many of his jokes and amusing stories will be posted on this site.  He and I have developed Missing Turnip Trilogy, which will soon be posted.  I would also like to give a shout out to General Custard who despite smelling funny has also added to the resevoir of stories.  I'd also like to recognize K-Unit.  Way to be homie... and Amber.  You're awesome, glad we met.  K-Unit & Amber, I'm not really sure what to say it's unfortunate what had to happen but i dunno.  so...  Rock On.  I've also gotta give a shout out to Steve-O.  Hey man, you rock, sucks that your movin to vegas.  Adam apparently isn't content with only having one sentence, cause usually he can't have just one thing at a time.  Like if he's eatin a cheeseburger, ya know he's gonna ask for another and another..... and another  Well Adam, here it is, I hope you're happy.  Wookie, you're crazy as fuck and you're the only kid i know that sounds like a wookie.    Props to Travis.  He's had the same same lameass pos name on msn forfuckinever.  3.1415 days later... Travis still has the Milk Man name.

      Wear brown socks and if someone asks you why you are wearing brown socks say, "Affirmative action.".  Say no more and carry on doing what you were before the question occured.  I suppose it would work for black socks too, but I like the idea of brown socks better

      Tell a teacher that you hate him/her and that you are going to rape them in their sleep and sodomize their dog and fart on their cat.  Trust me, they'll understand.  BTW... I've come to the conclusion that my driver's ed teacher is a jackass.  And he smells funny.

      Ok, so my driver's ed teacher is a jackass... And he hates me.  Just imagine a jackass hating you... It's bad enough to have a jackass for a teacher, but to have a jackass that hates me is even worse.  Here's a little story about that cocksucking piece of shit.  He gave us our midterm evaluation sheets today(tomorrow's the last day of class).  We were supposed to get these sheets last week so that we could see what we needed to work on.  Well, I got mine, and apparently I'm an out of control driver and I drive blindfolded with my feet on the wheel using my face to press the gas and brake pedals because out of 35 categories, 5 were good(the highest score).  The rest were poor(the lowest score).  I know I might not be a perfect driver, but I'm sure there are areas where I don't suck, but honestly, I don't deserve a poor in every fucking category... BTW, the 5 I got a good on were getting in the car and preparing to drive.  Well, at least I'm not a danger to society in that area.

      Ok, three hours ago (give or take 36 hours) I was chatting w/ a friend when I found myself making a simple three word statement. "It is not." Too late, I realized that I could have shortened this phrase to two words. "It's not." Then having already made a fool of myself I noticed it could have been shortened to "It isn't." Man, I sure shot myself in the foot. Meanwhile, this hermaphodite I was talking to just kept talking despite the important discovery I made. Of course, I didn't tell him, but I think it was implied that something significant happened. It was something physical that happened. I suddenly felt like I was breathing cold air. Determined not to make a fool of myself any more than necessary I did not admit the fact that I had just turned a fan that was pointing at my face on. I passed this off as nothing. I started thinking. If I can shorten "it is not" to "it's not" and "It isn't" then why can't I just say "It'sn't". I came to the conclusion that had I said "It'sn't" Flatface would have found a way to virtually bitch slap me so I decided to keep the idea to myself.... Until now... (ok, this is when the mist should start forming at my feet and I should begin my sane laugh that would soon turn evil and obsessively obnoxious, and the Imperial March would begin and continue in an amazing crescendo until it was loud enough to break windows, but unfortunately I don't live in Hollywood and all isn't going to turn out well. I'll probably die of leukemia and my evil twin will take my idea and make millions of dollars, but what can you do when you don't live in Hollywood?) Ok, so I revealed it to you fooligans on the internet, but it's copyrighted now so eat it bitches.

Nothing to the likes were ever mentioned or ever even thought of, but Aunnie, if there was one I'd definitely let you in on it... lol...

      Ok, so I went to Wendy's earlier today and my brothers and I were waiting in line.  I found it extremely unnecessary for us all to wait in line so I said, "Excuse me, I must worsh my hands."  As I walked away, I over heard Matt say, "Did he just say worsh?"  I ignored the blatantly ignorant words that were pouring out of his mouth.  Honestly, what was he thinking.  Of course I said worsh.  Remember, I lived in Tennessee until a year ago?  Well, that's not the point.  The bathroom was one of those public restrooms that's only meant for one person and you're supposed to lock the door while you're using it.  Well, a few seconds after I walked in I noticed an old man on the crapper and I exclaimed, "Oh shit, sorry about that,"  I spoke only to occupy my mouth, and he said, "Oh, it's no problem, carry on..."  I was thinking, well, it would be rude if I didn't stay now because I already saw the man on the can trying to push a log out his ass and he did tell me to stay.  As I said before, I only went to the bathroom to wash my hands so I turned on the faucet, which projected the water at an unnecessaryily high velocity.  I got my hands wet and squeezed some soap on them when I realized I really had to take a piss.  So, I rinsed the soap off and dryed my hands so I wouldn't get my private areas all wet, and I went over to the urinal, and relieved my bladder.  I then had to wash my hands again, all the while this older male is still pushing that log through.  I dryed my hands and left saying as I walked out the door and jokingly said, "Hey man, good luck w/ that shit."

      Ok, so I went into town last night to practice parallel parking with my mom.  My first try sucked... as did the next three, but by the fifth time I tried it I did a decent job.  About the seventh or eighth time I was pulling into a spot when I noticed a lady in her forties walking by on the sidewalk with a smile on her face.  This wasn't the customary, "Brad, you're so hot, take your pants off now" type smile.  It was more like, "He He, giggle like school children, this kid's learning how to parallel park, I better run to my spot so he doesn't hit my car" type smile.  Or it could have been the, "Hey, I remember sixty-five years ago when I was learning how to parallel park.  If you think this is hard, try doing it with a horse and buggy."  Anyway, I thought this was worth mention.

Yo... Yo... Yo.......Yo..Yo...Yo,(6x)  I was born in the ghetto  Yo yo yo yo,  I'm the pimp w/ all the ho's.  yo, fuck the man,  bitch, I'll draw on his face w/ a crayon.

      Ok, more on Saturday night and Sunday morning.  Well, I've got to say, that Boone's Farm was probably the best alcoholic beverage(lol, who calls them alcoholic beverages anymore?... That's right.  I do.) I ever did drink.  I didn't drink too much though, because Amber's mom knew we would be drinking and I had a good idea that we would probably get caught and I didn't want to be too fucked up when we did.  Then, after everyone was done drinking their vodka and OJ we went to Java Jim's... And it sucked.  The band was possibly the worst band I have ever heard.  Their lyrics contained all "MAHHHHHH's", "GAHHHHHHH'S", and "RAHHHHHH's."  To go along with the crappy vocals, the vocalist was fat and was wearing girls pants and a tight shirt.  Sooo... we went to the outside area and as we walked throught the door, some A-hole started bitching at us, telling us to close the door because the neighbors would call the cops if we left it open because the music was too loud.  Ya know what?  Fuck you, I don't really if they pull the plug on that band, they suck.  Sommer, Chadd, and I left about 15 minutes later.  When we walked into the hotel room Kathy was in there and she said, "I found the orange juice, where's the vodka?"(we put the vodka in the safe and took the key.)  We said we didn't know and went swimming.  Then she went to Java Jim's to get the rest of the people and they gave her the key to the safe.  lol, she was pretty pissed off, but we didn't get in trouble.   Ok, honestly, who puts a mirror in front of a toilet?  Honestly, I don't like watching myself pee.  It's just really weird.  TBC

      Man, Amber's party at the Ramada inn last night was good fun.  Too much happened for me to remember all of it, but I will fill you in on some key moments.  I think one of the funnier moments occured at about 3 am.  Amber was goin a little crazy with the ice and stuck an ice cube down my pants.  Naturally, I kept it there for about twenty seconds because understandably, it gets really hot in my pants so an ice cube once in a while feels good.  After about twenty seconds, I declared, "My hands are in my pants," and grabbed the ice cube.  I then walked over to amber and rubbed it in her face and she took it and stuck it in Matt, her boyfriends mouth.  Good fun... Good fun.  TBC... I'm fuckin tired.

      OK, call your girlfriend on the Telephone and talk for about five minutes before you tell her you've got a call waiting.  Tell her you'll be right back then put her on hold... Then, wait about ten miuntes and put her back on the line while wildly screaming some random woman's name.  Like this, "Oh, yesss, (insert name here)"  Then when she asks what's goin on, simply say, Umm... "I'm sorry hun, I didn't realize my time was up.  You were saying something about the time billy called you.... blah blah blah.... it doesn't matter what you say after the "my time was up" part, but you do have to somehow tell her w/o straight up telling her that it was phone sex that her time was up for.

      Ok, so last night I went to Amber's softball game, which I saw none of.  Apparently they won though... I think they actually won by the ten run rule after having been beat by it in all of the previous games.  I rolled up in my minivan listening to softcore hits.  As I pulled into the parking lot I noticed Sommer and Jessie walking over toward the jungle gym with some strange miniature being.  Apparently they call those things kids... Well, I thought it would be funny if I drove by them and exclaimed, "I'm Rick James, bitches," as I smakced them in the faces.  On second thought, it would have been downright hilarious... As they might say in the hood, "That's off the chain, yo."  I also figured that it would be very inappropriate and a bad thing to do in general...  After pondering the choices, I decided to just park the van and let my mother slide into the drivin chair so she could get outta that place.  I then walked over to the jungle, cautiously, as to slip past the ninjas undetected.  I walked over there and said "Hey, Kidz."  Please note that I did pronounce kids with a "z" and not an "s".  We watched the child that they were supporting run around and go ape shit on that jungle gym for a while.  Then flat face arrived... The first thing he said to me was, "Hey, do you have any weed?"  I said, with a grin on my face, "No, I don't participate in your illegal activities"  So we sat there and made funnies at the expense of others for a while... Flat face and I were on a roll... We had insults left and right.  After a few minutes, Sommer noticed that some kids were  picking on another kid at the jungle gym so she told us. "Ok, go for it mom," I replied.  She then went over and said, "Stop picking on him, you're gonna make him cry."  "Yeah, that'll show them."  Then I jokingly said, "Why don't you tell the kid that's getting picked on to rape the other kids?"  Then she actually yelled, "Rape him, Rape him."  This sent the kids into a frenzy yelling rape and hitting each other. Sommer and Jessie walked up to the softball field embarrassed.  Flat Face and I eventually suppressed our laughter and followed them.  TBC...  Ok, funny story, there's this kid named Billy that is always at the games and always follows us around... Well, he's really annoying and we all hate him so the last two games everyones basically been telling him to fuck off cause we hate him...  Last time he grabbed Jessie's ass and tried to lick her face.  Sooo... at the game on Wednesday our jokes and shit got even worse... Flat Face started throwing this stick and telling him to go get it.  Well, naturally after he threw it one of the times we ran, well Jessie and Sommer did at least.  Flat Face and I just sort of walked away... He eventually caught up with us in the woods where I slipped on some sticks and said, "This game is fucking dangerous.  Whoever the fuck invented this sport needs to go to hell."  That being said, it is worth mention that Billy was swinging on vines and talking about beating off coyotes again.  Well, we were getting pretty pissed off so when he came back Flat Face said, "Billy, I'm gonna give you two dollars to go away and never come back again."  Billy accepted the offer and left.  Well, that's the end of that chapter, or so I thought.  Jessie said she felt bad... I said something to the effect of, umm, this kid grabbed your ass and tried to lick your face last week and you feel bad that we paid him to fuck off?  Well, that went unanswered.  BTW, I hope that deal had a lifetime warranty.  It should work though, cause Flat Face told him that if he ever bothered us again he would punch him in the face and take the money back... LMAO... that's a riot... Flat Mr. Peace Face punching someone in the face... Well, that's the end of this story.

      I made a new game that I call "What are the chances?"  It's a really fun game to play in crowded areas such as the softball game I was at last night.  The rules are simple.  First you check some sources to find some random statistic such as rape or murder or something...  Then, while with friends, you casually ask, "Hey, what are the chances that dude wants to rape me?"  Then they take some guesses which are, for the most part, ridiculous.  After a while of humoring them, you need to exclaim "Wrong!  This experiment further proves my hypothesis that you suck at life.  The chance that that man will rape me is 1 in 12...  For example, for those of you that don't understand probability, if I lined up 12 men, the statistics say that 1 of them should want to rape me."  This game is great.  I haven't tried it yet though...  I will soon

      Ok, so I went to Family Video today.  Those fucktards didn't have anything I wanted to see so I left empty handed...  On the way out I noticed these two strange children holding hands and skipping towards the door.  As they approached the door I realized that they weren't holding hands, skipping, nor were they by any means children.  They were old.  The guy looked like he was a Gangsta back in the day though so I figured I should hold the door for an older brotha... So I lingered holding the door for the old man who had the appearance of being in his twenties, possibly fresh out of high school.  He gave me a strange look, so I was thinking, "uh yeah, fuck you too."  Then as he walked past me, I realized that, like the jackass that I am, I was holding the fucking exit door open for him.  I was like, "Hey, buddy that was a joke.  Ya know? like Ha Ha, He He style."  Then I busted out the oldman laugh (thanks for that one molemonkey) and fell on the ground laughing like an old man who fell off his rocker while tripping.

      Well, umm... I don't think I can really expand upon that.  I guess I could use a form of emotional appeal and say that the common cold is killing people with AIDS every day.  Or ethical appeal, Cold's are morally unjust and illegal.  The virus also invades private property, that being the body, but because that argument may be faulty for people such as prostitutes who invite people into their bodies, I could also say that cold's are gay and they want to get married which is illegal in most states.  That's right, bitches, I went there.  Here's some logical appeal, They're just damned annoying and they're meanie heads.  Yeah, that's right, I said it, meanie heads.

      http://special.msn.com/weeklyreader/   "The U.S. Constitution's 26th Amendment guarantees that any U.S. citizen 18 or older can vote. But some lawmakers in California recently tried to push the voting age there even lower. The measure is called Training Wheels for Citizenship. It would give 16- and 17-year-olds one-half of a vote. Fourteen- and 15-year-olds would get one-quarter of a vote. Do you think that proposal is a good idea?"  Don't we already have enough ignorance in the system?  Honestly, this is terrible... I think we should raise the voting age to...  People who have an idea of what's going on and won't be swept up by jackasses like John Kerry and George Bush...  Which reminds me... It's been a while since we've had a good president.  I think FDR was the last good one.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA... ya, I know that wasn't funny.  I thought it had potential though.   "Impress your friends: Talk all about Thomas Jefferson"  Is that all it takes to impress third graders now?  Back when I was in third grade, it was the kid with the biggest dick or something stupid like that.   "Week of June 1, 2004     Which recent president do you most respect?  President George W. Bush  President Bill Clinton  None of the above      Click here to see results."   Honestly, is there anything to respect in either of them?    Here's the k-2 poll.  All I can say is LMFAO  "Where Should the President Eat? Traveling all over the United States can make a president hungry. Which place do you think he should eat at the most?   Week of June 1, 2004     When traveling around the country, which place should the president eat at the most?  at fancy restaurants because he has plenty of money  at fast food restaurants because he is so busy  in his room at his hotel because he can wear pajamas           "When the president travels around the country, which of these places should he defintely visit?  schools, so he can see how much kids are learning  hospitals, so he can see how people are cared for  government building, so he can see how towns and cities are run            See the results without voting"  Honestly, what's the point?  Where the fuck is the punch line?

      Ok, so this story took place on a stormy day in June... Well, actually it was sunny and it was May...  It happened last Thrusday, but I just remembered about it today.  General Frye and I were walking to school and I was sort of out of it and nearly walked in front of a car so General Frye yelled, "Commander Brad, Stop!."  Then exactly 3.1415926535897932 seconds later a car drove by...  He saved my life by not letting me get hit by a car....  I think the government should give him a badge of bravery or something...

      Ok, so I went to a Whitesox game on Saturday.(that's baseball)... One thing I noticed that bugged the shit out of me was the people that woiuld always point out the obvious intentions of the team.&nbsp; Like, "Get a run guys."&nbsp; Well thanks jackass, I'm sure they aren't trying, maybe they didn't hear you.&nbsp; Try shooting a gun at your head to get their attention then maybe you can tell them what to do and we can get this game going.&nbsp; Or maybe, you could set up an intricate trap that would kill all of the fielders so that when the batter hit it there would be not defence.&nbsp; How about instead of actually yelling words you just yell because I'm sure the point of your yelling was to create noise, in which case, a simple "AHHHHHHHH!!!" would have been sufficient.

      Free my ass... The market isn't free until I can go to the market and legally buy a case of beer and a pack of cigarettes.&nbsp; Damn political rhetoric

      Next time you light a fire cracker think about the starving children in Somalia who never had fire works. Make sense? of course not. That was one of my liberal tourettes moments. Which brings me to my moral lesson of the day.&nbsp;   &nbsp; Oh, btw... moral lessons... that reminds me... Why does Jerry Springer think it is neccessary to have a moral message at the end of every show.&nbsp; Most of the people on that show are white trash as most of the people who watch the show are and they don't care what you have to say.&nbsp; Jerry Springer just needs to learn that when people watch his show they want to see fat chicks get naked and try to kick some other fat chick's ass for sucking her man off...  &nbsp; Final Thought this bitch.

      1.  I get to beat up Jerry Springer in the beginning. 2.  I get to kick Michael Moore in the junk. 3.  I get to kick Michael Moore while he's down. 4.  I get a limo that takes me around town to icecream shops and wacky carnivals w/clowns. 5.  All I can eat hotdogs. 6.  A movie trailor with a Canadian map on the wall and my points of attack marked in red. 7.  Name the movie.  "The Passion of Brad" and for the first fifteen minutes of the movie have a vietnamese whore beating off a dildo that is realistic looking and have a laugh track on. 8.  Just wait.  There are more.
