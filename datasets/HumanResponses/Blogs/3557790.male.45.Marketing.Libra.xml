      How did we get so far into the year already? Time is slipping by...and it's the perfect time to decandle your Japanese black pines. Short needles have long been the ideal on these trees, and for years, withholding water and fertilizer was recommended to achieve this goal. Unfortunately, this weakens the trees excessively and unnecessarily. Proper decandling technique avoids this while also balancing the vigor of the branches.  Who should decandle? Anyone who has well-developed branches and is ready to start training their tree for short needles. The tree should be fertilized heavily from the beginning of spring until now. To balance vigor on the tree, divide the candles mentally into four groups: strongest, strong, weak, weakest. Leave the weakest alone. This week, using very sharp shears, remove the weak candles at the base, being sure to cut straight across. One week to ten days later, remove the strong candles. And another week to ten days later, remove the strongest candles.   By removing the weakest candles first, the new buds which appear have a little headstart and so get stronger. The strongest candles are thus held back by two weeks. This is one aspect of balancing the vigor of Japanese black pines. Another aspect is removal of needles. Some of this may be done now on extremely vigorous branches, but mostly it will wait until autumn.  As soon as the candles are cut, remove all fertilizer from the black pines. This way we can control how big the new needles become. Water normally.  What else am I doing now? It will soon be time to defoliate healthy, well-developed trident maples. My only trident at this time was just dug this spring, and so it is far too soon to use defoliating techniques. This year will be devoted specifically to establishing the tree in its box.  The baby JBPs are doing quite well. They were wired this spring and are growing quite well. The wire is starting to bite and swell the trunks. I will leave the fertilizer on these for the entire year, but I will be removing the wire before the bark grows around it. These are wired in order to make the trunk swell, giving added girth and quicker development. A number of them are sending out adventitious buds down low, which will help tremendously in the future development. Next spring they will be transplanted into mesh pots for accelerated growth. I am following carefully the article from Bonsai Today #20, except that the trees were one year old plugs instead of seeds. I root-pruned the plugs last spring, arranged the roots, and planted them in six-inch nursery pots. I got about two years'growth last season, excited about this year.  Finished the back of the garage yesterday, and ready to build the shed. I will then be working on the display and growing areas. Hope to have pics to show by then.  Good luck to all my friends in the bonsai world!  Chris

      I figured it's about time I started posting more often, something that's a little harder with a website than a blog. So I may not get in here every day, but hopefully there will be plenty to educate, entertain, and provoke hair-rending.  My name is Chris Johnston, and while I have been enjoying bonsai for about 10 years, I only got serious about it when I met Boon Manakitivpart. I finished the first year of his course of Intensive classes and had to rejoin the real world, working for a living. I plan to start again this fall, and finish the four-year college education with him.  I have a number of trees, some nice, some not-so-nice that are remnants of a previous bonsai incarnation. My best trees are a couple of Japanese black pines, one older informal upright, and an imported exposed-root tree that I have been training for about 5 years. I also just purchased a trident maple with some massive proportions that I hope to advance very quickly.   I also have quite a few very young JBP seedlings that are about 3 years old. They are wired and growing very well. If they continue to develop as well as they are, I will be starting a new batch every couple of years. I hope this can be one contribution to the next generation of bonsai enthusiasts.

      The highlight of our month has come with a visit from my daughter Martha Parker! Martha is serving the U.S. Army and will be stationed in Hawaii. Her husband, Craig Parker, is currently serving in Iraq.   We had a great time watching the ball game on a beautiful day! The home team lost, but we got to see Carlos Beltran play his last game as a Kansas City Royal. Martha will be with us for a little while before she has to go suffer for the Army in Hawaii.   We have the next few days scheduled within an inch of our lives, like eating, drinking, playing games and eating, playing games and drinking... Then we go to see Cats! Ah what fun! It's good to have her here.  Here are the three of us (Martha, Rhonda, and Chris) enjoying dinner at P.F. Chang's China Bistro, and Martha and me (you can see where she gets her good looks).

      Is there a difference between critiquing and being critical? Where is the line separating giving constructive criticism and destructive or negativity?  A newbie comes to the Master Weekend with the Japanese black pine he is so proud of. It's in a one gallon nursery pot, looks like a stick with pom-poms of needles in strategic locations. Your newbie looks at the master with hope and expectation. What should he hear?   "Your tree shows promise and will be a fine bonsai in a few years. Keep up the good work." Would you hope to hear this from your consulting master? Being kind at the expense of the truth is certainly not becoming on someone considered to have a mastery of the subject. How has he helped the student in this encounter? The club has retained a newbie who is now becoming set in his newbieness because of the reinforcement he has received from the "master."  "This is unacceptable for critique! It has had no training and is still in a nursery pot. It is totally unsuitable for bonsai as it is now. Best to throw out this tree and buy a decent piece of stock." How about this answer? It's the absolute truth. It's a piece of junk and the student will never learn how to care for the species or learn advanced techniques from it. However, in this case your club has probably just lost an excited newbie.  What is the answer in this type of case? I'd like to draw an analogy from my years in a past life (I was a Baptist pastor). Many times I would see new believers in the first flush of their conversion, full of the wonder of it all, excited with the hope and discovery. They were prone to tell anyone they could corner, participated in all the Bible classes, and of course wanted to learn everything they could. They know nothing of theology, and next to nothing about the Bible itself, so of course they were always making statements bordering on the ridiculous, or alienating themselves from family and friends.  How were we as a church to help these folks? Of course we could have corrected them at every opportunity in order to tell them the truth and make certain they weren't spreading false doctrine in their "youthful" exuberance. But of course many times we would find that they quit coming back. We could have just smiled and nodded, but how does that person mature in their religion if all they get is smiles and nods?   There is a middle ground. If we look at our motivations for criticism, we will find that it's rarely as constructive as we rationalize. In response to direct questions, always tell the truth, but don't bludgeon the other with it. Allow room for healthy dialogue without bringing personality into it. Avoid setting yourself up as the authority, but appeal to higher authority and long and painful experience. And for God's sake, don't be poking fun at someone else's beliefs. We don't win someone to our way of thinking by ridiculing and belittling. It's all in the question, "Can you feel the love?"  We will always err on one side or the other of a fine line distinguishing truth versus kindness. But the two are not mutually exclusive. I have heard far too many rationalizations for just plain meanness that sound like, "I can't help but tell them the truth." Personally I would love to help far more people learn a great deal more about the nature of bonsai and its best techniques. And if I disagree with your techniques? I'll certainly bring it up. I might even stir the pot to get things going. But I want to be as positive as possible at all times.  Do I always measure up to my ideals? Nah. Do I strive for that goal? Absolutely. I hope to encourage others to do the same.  Chris

      Man, it's tough sometimes, working 50 hours per week and trying to train bonsai too. A sprinkler system is always inferior to good hand watering, but when we hit our 100+ degrees days (last year over a month of them), it's the only way I can get a second watering in.  When you get two odd days off a week (never together), one of them being Sunday for family stuff, the house jobs backlog seems overwhelming and pinching that maple seems like it can wait another day or two. Then next week rolls around and it's too late. This time of year it's hard for me to keep my mind on work instead of the trees.  So it's a balancing act, one that I guess I will have to perfect through the years. Any ideas?  Chris

      Sorry I don't have previous pics of this tree. It was collected by a local bonsai friend several years ago and trained in a pine style, with jins extending above the top of the foliage. My desire after he gave it to me was to A) reduce the rootball for a shallower pot (this one) since his grafted roots had grown so well, 2) give the tree a more natural elm appearance with upper branches reaching for the sky, and III) change the planting angle so the "parent" trunk is not dominated by the "child."  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  I removed the massive lower roots and base of the trunk two years ago, placing the tree in this imtermediate pot. The incorrect planting position is entirely my fault and largely due to the root placement around the tree. Following is a side view.     &nbsp;  I wired the branches upward last year and allowed the tree to grow. Around July 14, I defoliated the tree and wired it completely, with the results you see. The new planting angle should be something like this:     I have given a lot of movement to the branches with the idea that they will grow and the bases of the branches will set. Then I will cut back hard and start again. I have used some of the old original branches, most of which are inappropriate in that they are long and straight and cannot be bent. In future, I hope to graft all new branches on this tree. Also, the top of the parent trunk is a large chunk of deadwood. It had previously been a large, pointed jin. My plan is to carve this deeply to make a hollow trunk effect and thus make this tree look far more natural.   Since I have finished this work (and worked the bugs out of my html), the tree is responding well with new leaves. I will be offering some photos of its development as the year progresses.    Update 07/29/04    The tree is responding well and sending out a wealth of new leaves. The next two photos show the tree about one week and two weeks after the work, respectively.           Soon I will cut back hard to force more back budding, leaving a few long shoots for grafting next spring.   Chris

      Here it is, the last week in July in the heartland. We expect to feel more like Texas than San Francisco, but it's been rainy and in the 50's for the last couple of days! I am thinking that perhaps the trees may not slow down their growth so much this year. Typically at this time of year, we must be careful to avoid overwatering because the trees actually use less water, but at the same time avoid overheating of the root systems. But this summer has been so spectacular, lawns are green and growing fast, flowers are still abloom, and I can wear a suit to work once in a while!  As soon as the weather warms up a bit, I will be repotting the tropicals. A few of these are ficus of various quality and age, but one is an older fukien tea. I hope to chronicle the process here on the blog.
