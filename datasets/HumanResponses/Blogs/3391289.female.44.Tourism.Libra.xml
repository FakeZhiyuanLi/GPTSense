						   ...Than so busy, I can't think straight.  Because when I  DO  get that busy, I just want to kill people.  And since I don't have any of my weapons with me, I'm not only not able to kill people, I still have call after call to take.  And I can't tell my customers to kiss my large, white ass.

						   I forgot to take my pill again today!  It's Randy's fault, him and his damn prescriptions!  And I tried to remind myself, too.

						   I am so not together!  I forgot to order Randy's temazepam!  Criminy, I can't believe I forgot!  I feel soooo  dense .   I'm not real sure it actually does anything anymore, but that's not an excuse. Not exactly boosting the ol' self-esteem.  If I had self-esteem.

						   On all 161 counts!   Yes, I know the original trial was just for the 6 federal agents in the building, but, damn, this trial was a pointless waste of money!  And Nichols shouldn't get the death penulty, he should rot in jail.

						   Calls are kind of light, today.  And we've had some computer problems.  So, we Customer Service Agents talk amongst ourselves.  We tend to let our paranoid (and not so paranoid) imaginations run wild.  Ok, I've said in a previous post that I work for a membership-driven travel service.  I'm in the basic CS, the 48 states, air, car and hotel.  It seems like we're doing less and less.  And we've heard rumors of our department closing.  And we get anxious.  Like, I don't sell well, which is why I'm in CS and not out on the floor as a travel agent.    I am going insane!  There are 7 out of 9 available.  God, I wish I could get online games at work!  I'd kill for  Bookworm !  I guess I could dig out a magazine.  Or read a book.  My knitting in the car, so that's out.  I'm not really in a knitting mood, anyway.  Thunder!  Moore people will be getting skittish.  Understandably, but still annoying.  I guess I could go over one of my recurring stories, my favorite, right now, is David and Charles, and Billy is good, too (my others are kind of derivative), but I get frustrated because they have no end and I end up dwelling on them all the time.  How do I know if they're any good?  Just because I like them, doesn't mean they're good.  Even if they  ARE  good, I don't really know how to get them out of my head.  Maybe someday I'll write them down here.    Yeah, and maybe somebody will actually read this, too!!

						   We tried over the weekend to buy a truck, a 2002 Ford F250 - Powerstroke Diesel, got a great price for it, couldn't get a bank loan, and we don't want to finance through the dealership.  It was a good truck, but not really what Randy wanted.  He doesn't want a foo-foo truck, he wants a work truck - diesel - cloth seats - either club or crew cab - wants 4x4 but not with the shift on the fly button.  Oh well, it would've been too tight anyway.   And, actually, I'm kind of relieved.  I don't need to be any more freaked out about money.  And, let me tell ya, I can freak myself out real quick just thinking about which bills are due and when.  Oh, it's phone, electric, gas, car, insurance.

						   I'm having a pretty good day.  I'm a little bored here at work. But the slacker side says "I'd rather be bored than busy!" I'm in the Customer Service Department of a large membership-based travel service.  Why am I in Customer Service?  Because I'm too concerned with helping people, than making a sale.  And I'm pretty good at it!

						   Those Kirk Humphreys ads blow my mind!  Everything he takes credit for, Ron Norick was responsible.  All Humphreys did was shove Bass Pro down our throats - at our expense.  I hope he doesn't make it out of the primary!

						   But I'm not desperate.  And yes, I  DID  take my pill!  Of course, missing 3 days didn't help.  I still don't think Zoloft is working.  I guess I should switch to Paxil CR (the last in the formulary).  Yes, Paxil works for me,  BUT  it also makes me unable to orgasm. YAY!!

						   Do I keep rattling on about myself, or go off on another tangent?  Like how much I really, REALLY,  REALLY  hate my prescription coverage.  Or my worries about my husband.  Or my son, the honor student.  You know, I know I'm not supposed to worry about things I have no control over, but somtimes you just can't help it.  My husband's big (in a good way), almost a foot taller than me, handsome, funny, smart, and has arthritis that covers pretty much his entire skeleton.  We don't know how it happened.   The year 2000 wasn't great.  Our try at having a motorcycle shop was nearing an end.  I cracked up and lost my job in the International Department at a major car rental reservation center (mostly my fault).  RW one day noticed his neck hurt, and we made an appointment for a local chiropractor for the next Monday.  Sunday, he went riding at Stillwater with a (fair weather) friend, took a horrible spill (we should still have on video somewhere), up over the handlebars, down on his head or neck.  Yes, I screamed.  Did we rush to an emergency room?  No, my hubby changed back into regular clothes, videotaped other riders the rest of the day. He even drove home, at first because there was a decrepit wood bridge that I was scared to drive over, then he said he couldn't get out of the seat (and I felt like a crumb).  He was in pain, but, hey, he was going to the chiropractor the next day anyway.  So we're at the chiropractor, she takes xrays, then puts him on the machine that zaps your back.  When she came out with his xrays, she was literally white as a sheet.  RW laughed and said, "Well, I know my neck's not broken!" "No, but it is fused."  Then she showed us.  She had RW take xrays of the rest of his back at our local (deathcamp)hospital.  She recommended he see our php (who I would have swore was the oldest doctor on the planet).  Yet more xrays.  We learn it's not just his neck that's fused, it's almost his entire spine.  He recommends a rheumatologist.  Back at the shop, I look up rheumatologist on Encarta, which, of course, leads me to the arthritis entry.  When I find ankylosing spondylitis, I yell, "I found your back!"   Now, Mama had rheumatoid arthritis.  Daddy had a little osteoarthritis.  I even had a piano teacher at Oscar Rose Junior College with Lupus.  But ankylosing spodylitis, or DISH (diffuse ideopathic skeletal hypertosis), we had never heard of them.  What happens is bone grows and fuses the vertebrae together, usually from the tailbone up, RW's from the neck down (he can look left and right a little, but has no up or down).  There is a gene associated with it (hla-b27), but RW doesn't have it.  No real family history of arthritis.  It was just sort of out of the blue. The rheumatologist told him he was screwed and faced a world of pain.  He recommended he try for Social Security disability.  Everybody told us, "You be turned down, you'll have to have a lawyer."  Well, everybody but the doctor.   Most inane question SSA asked, "Do you watch TV?"   RW's answer, "Hell yes!  I'm in pain, I'm not dead!" He was approved.  In fact, the agent asked him how he could even move.  We learned he would be reevaluated in seven years.  To see if he's gotten better.  "Get better?!" I said, "I was just hoping you'd to stay the same!" That was four years ago, I wish he had stayed the same.  It's now spread to his shoulders, knees, now hips, and has the heel spurs from hell.   He's in constant pain.  Pain med-wise, he's taken vioxx (worthless, tore up his stomach), celebrex (ditto), advil liqui-gels (worked better, tore up his stomach), the duragesic patch (made him vomit, he says it didn't work that well).   That's the background of husband worries.  And it all gets tied up in money worries and health insurance gripes.  Last September, my work changed prescription coverage.  It sucks.  I can't use Walgreens, which I prefer, I have to use Eckerds.  And if I don't set up recurring prescriptions as mail order, I have to pay a percentage, instead of a lower copay.  I'm Ms. Not Together!  I think of getting refills when I run out!  I'm not together enough for mail order.  What the hell is wrong just getting it at our local pharmacy?  And God forbid it's not on their formulary!  You have to pay full price!  RW's has like 6 different prescriptions right now - oxycontin for pain, generic phenergan because oxy makes him vomit, lotrel for blood pressure, paxil cr for depression (not working), temazepam to help him sleep (not working well), and now a prescription laxative.   My health insurance almost doubled, it was $44.00 a pay period last year, this year, $83.00.  Did the benefits double as well?  They didn't even stay the same, prescriptions I've gone over, I have more copays this year.  Who do I gripe to when nobody cares?  They'll just spout off about containing costs.   Not Mine.

						   I haven't been reading blogs for long.  Actually I just started reading them this year.  I just kept thinking, "Jeez, I'd like to do that!"   Of course, being Ms. Not Together, I also wonder why anybody would read anything I would have to write.   But, ya know, I've spent too much of my life being afraid of what people would think of me.  It's providence, I happened onto this while trying to get to one of my regular blogs.  I love to write, even it's about nothing.     So, I guess I should introduce myself.  I've now spent more of my life depressed than not.  I'm on 100mg of Zoloft (formularies bite!) that I don't think is working (well not as well as Lexapro - nonformulary).  My first depression was from the prerequisite traumatic event in third grade - I had a teacher who spanked me for not finishing my work (even though my mother told her the best way to teach me - I didn't learn the way everyone else did - she got the "Are you a teacher?" routine) - until I was about 20/21.  Depression in itself being self-defeating, I gained weight.  Yeah, fat AND SHY.  No, I take that back, I went waaaay beyond just being shy (and I swear nobody understands).  I had  RULES  (Don't speak unless spoken to...Don't look anybody in the eye, that you don't have to...if you're friendly with someone in one particular place, but you see them in an alternate place, don't acknowledge them - they might not want to talk to you...etc)!  Needless to say, I kind of coasted (ghosted?) through school. I got out of elementary school knowing no math at all.  Mama and Daddy didn't have a clue as to how to deal with me (this was the late '60s).  And I idolized my sister - she was perfection to me.  I was different.  The list goes something like this:   I was fat/they were thin (Daddy wasn't really thin though)   I have green eyes/they have brown   I'm shy/they're outgoing   They're smart/I'm...not   Oh, and I'm a blond/My sister and Mama had brown hair (Daddy white) I tried to do everything my sister did, she being my ideal.  Yeah, that didn't really work out.   Now there were some things I did for myself.  I took piano lessons (recitals were killers).  I did take ballet for a while, but Mama and Daddy couldn't afford it (it was around the time my aunt was getting divorced from her worthless-ass, abusive husband (and I'm still glad he's dead)and my Grandma was living with us, too, I think).  And I read almost anything put in front of me.  But the things I did for myself, it's like they didn't count.  I can't really explain the things in my child's depressed mind.  There's no logic to it.  I hated myself.

						   Why the hell  urlLink  this   suprises people?!   Jesus Christ! I deal with this every day!  I end up feeling guilty for being depressed, because it just means $20 lost going to the doctor, and $10 on up for the prescription, which may or may not work.  God forbid my doctor recommends a therapist (another at least $20 a pop).  And that's just me.  My husband has Ankylosing Spondylitis, a form of arthritis that causes bone to grow and fuse the spine together (but, no, he doesn't have the associated gene: HLA/B27).  Right now he has 5 different prescriptions, starting at $10.  He's on disability, so if there's a medical bill (copay, whatever) that I can't pay upfront, yeah, there's a good possibility it's going to be put off.

						   I'm having one of those sad and inadequate days.  Yes, I did forget to take my antidepressants today.  And yes, I maybe in the throes of PMS (one gripe, I'm not going to have anymore children, why am I still having a  freakin'  period?!  Periods suck). The more I think about it, the more I think it is PMS, because lately I've actually been, if not happy, then also not sad.  Depression is basically the one PMS symptom I have that's still reliable.  I don't have the zit on my chin anymore.  My breasts aren't reliably sore anymore.  Cramps are only after I start to flow.  Bloating, I don't notice, I'm fat all the time.  And I don't really have the undying hunger that I used to.   I am kind of worried that when the meno does pause, will I be depressed all the time (hah! Like I'm not now!)?  With no antidepressants that work reliably (or that I can afford)? Note to the odd person who reads this:  I can't take Welbutrin - I have a history of seizures. I also feel kinda funny about asking my young, male (cute) doctor about menopause, perimenopause, and everything related.  Yeah, I know, it's mostly a head thing, he's a really good (cute) doctor.  I wish I could talk to Mama.

						   I was looking at  urlLink  Pandagon   today (sorry, I'm new at this and don't know how to link.  Also I usually do this at work, and the Help is blocked but posting to my blog isn't - go figure), laughing at  urlLink  The Club for Growth's   completely inane add supposedly for W (it just doesn't play that way).  Anyway, I'm at their site and the  second  add is...  Tom Coburn's Baby add!   You know the one says he's delivered all these babies, he's SINGLEHANDEDLY got some legislation or so (I pay so much attention) passed. Yeah, singlehandedly!  That's a riot! Geez, the thing that really stinks, (although I know it's pretty much a given anymore) is here is an out of state, completely outsider group shilling for Coburn.   What?!  Are Anthony and Humphreys not republican enough?  Hell, Humphreys (I'm sorry, can't stand him) has all our in state republicans shilling for him.  I still say, if you're Republican, there is only one choice - Bob Anthony.  As Corporation Commissioner he's been a pretty good watch dog.  He actually has done more for Oklahomans than Coburn or Humphreys.      UPDATE   I finally paid more attention to that commercial, well, than I usually do.  They claim he singlehandedly saved $1 billion in wasted!  Sounds like a goddamn superhero to me!  PS   I think I've figured that link thing.  We'll see.

						   I know it's been awhile since I've wrote.  I don't really have much of an excuse, life just kinda gets in the way.   I'm having one of those "I  really  need to talk to you" days.  I can't seem to shake off this depression.  I'm not dreadfully unhappy, and certianly not suicidal (right now), I'm, well, in Purgatory.  I am on Zoloft, but it's not working real well.  I'm sure you've heard my rants on my health insurance.  I don't want to be this way forever, but everything costs so much.  And I still have to think about RW.  I know, I know, I have to think of myself.  Yes, I remember Grandmother taking care of not one, but  two  elderly relatives, who outlived her. But, he's not getting better, Mama, although he might be getting worse at a slower pace than before.  That maybe my wishful thinking.  His arthritis (ankylosing spondylitis, DISH, whatever) pretty much covers his entire skeleton.  So shoot me, I worry. I don't worry about JW, though!  Can you believe he's a Senior now?!  I'm not sure he'll make it to the 5'7" I always told him he'll be, but he is taller than me (barely).  And very handsome.  Yeah, still shy.  He's working at Braum's now.  Soon we'll get Daddy's van for him.  It's big, it's old, but that's just too damn bad, it's free.  RW might be getting him interested in the Navy.  I can see his point.  He doesn't really know what he wants to do, or where he wants to do it (aside from out of Oklahoma).  It would give him structure and a guaranteed, pretty good paying job.  I'm pretty out of the loop on this.  I want him to go to college.  It can be the Naval Academy, it can be ROTC at a regular college.  Like I said, I'm out of the loop, and it's driving me crazy.   JW's quit band, but is on the yearbook staff, and is Vice-President of the Senior class.  He'll be taking AP English, Honors Calculus, Honors Physics, Yearbook staff is one of the classes, and I forget the others.  The band director tried to get him to stay, but Jw said he wanted to have time to do other things.  This is the person you'd swear was glued to the couch, his Gameboy fused to his hands.  I think he wants to enjoy his Senior year. He maybe joining the Navy, I don't have enough info now, though.  RW says they're pretty taken with JW.  If it's what he wants, I'm all for it, but I need to learn more. My life is pretty boring.  It's mostly between home and work.  I work in Moore and live in Guthrie, it's time consuming.  It gets old.  I'm getting weird signals at work.  They say they're not closing the center, but the underlying vibe says something different.  If not closing altogether, then a big shakeup.  That scares the crap out of me.  I hate looking for a job.  I still wish I hadn't of screwed myself out of Hertz.  Yeah, I know, I hated Hertz.  I wish I could make a living at this blog.  You always thought I should be a writer.  I know it's little more than an online diary (or therapy), but I'm published for everyone to see (or not)!  You would be so proud!  But then, you're proud of me already. I love you, Mama. I miss you.    I have to put a little addendum here.  My mother died in February 1999.  The year was hard, my grief unending, my depression deepening.  On Thanksgiving, well it was bad.  My husband, RW, said "Why don't you go outside and talk to your Mom?" Well, I'm not a talker.  So I started writing letters.  I write when I need to talk to my Mom.

						   I've been thinking (and yes, it is hard work).  I think I need to throw a party.  I know what you're thinking, "But you're Ms. Not Together, how does a not together person throw a party?" Yeah, that's crossed my mind, too.  It gets worse.  Outside of the blogiverse, I'm very shy, very introverted.  Suppose I actually (which is kind of unlikely, since thinking and doing are two different things), throw said party, would I actually talk to people?  But, if I'm inviting the people I know, the people I'm comfortable with, theoretically, I could talk my ass off (which would be a good thing, you should see my ass). Ok, here's what I see:  I would have it at my mother-in-law's house.  That's because I live in a crappy mobile home in  Meth-Lab Estates .  Put citronella candles around the yard, maybe a string or two of lights in the big elm tree in the back.  Randy would cook (certainly not me!).   Good music, good drink, good food, good friends.

						   I just need to go to parties and get drunk! A co-worker had a party on Saturday, a bunch of us from work, and a few of his friends.  Since I  did  bring my husband, I was able to drink.   And I did. A rum punch (plastic Coca-Cola glass)- too much rum, not enough punch. A Bacardi raspberry thing (basically flavored beer) - really good. A shot of whiskey. - ehh, not a whiskey person (my mother made cough syrup out of it.) A shot of tequila.  I still say tequila would be good in a Sonic Cherry Limeade, but Sherri swears vodka (I've never drank vodka).  Oh, the Sonic Sunrise (which is a Cherry Limeade made with orange juice), too. Another shot of tequila (because Kory didn't see me do the first one). and half of a margarita (in my same Coca-Cola glass). I laughed, I talked, I had a damn good time!  I didn't have a sad or worthless thought all weekend! And it was worth being nauseous all the next day!

						   And I'm the CS Rep!  I really, really  HATE  Ch*******ets!!  I also hate people who say, "well, aren't  you  my travel agent?!"   Well, aren't you the person who doesn't look at their itinerary until the day before travel, only to discover some "mistake" we made? Or maybe you're the person who can't read a car rental agreement to save your life (the rate we give is after discounts, but not including any fees or taxes).  And, no, god damn it, we can't confirm a specific make of car!  And if you don't have a major credit card with  your  name on it, most likely you're not getting a car.  And, yes, we did tell you that, you chose not to listen. People, be proactive.  Don't trust us.  Double check everything we do.  We're human, we can make mistakes.  The quicker you catch a mistake, the easier (and cheaper) it is to fix.   Oh, and when you need to call customer service, drop the 'tude.  If you have a 'tude, we get a 'tude.  Besides, you're getting to travel, I don't have that luxury, so shut up!

						   Okay, I'm back.  Well, trying to get back.  This depression is really kicking my ass.  Not to mention, my crappy prescription coverage at work.  And that I hate to go to the doctor.  I hate to spend money on myself.  Compared to my husbands health problems, my puny depression isn't shit.  AAAAnd I don't a real good opinion of myself.   Now here I am spouting off in my cheap (re: free) form of psychotherapy.  I've said it before, right now I want to be sitting in front of the tv, my mind numb.

I've asked this time and again, Why is it that my head was screwed on the tighted, I was happy, I was positive, during my first (abusive) marriage?  Are the one or two people who've read this out there?  Can you tell me?

						   Well, that's what my son says when he's petting our basset hound, Bubba.  I would always protest.  Bubba's not dumb, I would say.  But I'm not so sure. When I was walking him (and our entourage: Whiskers & Midnight the cats, and Rogue the dachshund) this morning, he got scared of a rock.  Yes, a rock!  A red sandstone rock about the size of a high-top sneaker.  We come almost up to it, he stops, " WOOOOOOF !" I kick it over with my foot and say, "Bubba, it's only a rock!" As I kicked it over he jumped back, then, very slowly, very carefully, got closer to it, and sniffed it. Bubba is the sweetest dog, but maybe "Bubba Dumb."

						   I just noticed he's running for senate, too.  At least you know he's someone who hasn't just bent over for big business.  As corporation commissioner, he's made sure our utilies have been fair to us.  That's way more than I can say of Humpreys.

						   Again, he acts like he's anointed by God, sent directly from heaven to Oklahoma.  Hopefully that'll work as well for him as it did for Steve Largent ( Who?  HA HA HA HA HA!) Again he spouts off about all he's done for OKC.  Excuse me?!  He didn't do  SQUAT !  MAPS & MAPS For Kids were Ron Norick's babies.  All Humphreys did was shove Bass Pro down our throats!  And now  THEY'RE  building an equal-sized store in Broken Arrow, and Broken Arrow isn't paying a dime.  13 million in taxpayer money for a store that was supposed to be exclusive.  Assurances that the city was going to make that up in sales tax and more.  Didn't matter that it was a huge slap in the face to the sporting goods/hunting/boating stores (Academy, Great Outdoors, etc.) already here.  They didn't get anything at the city trough.  I'm sure they'd have built in Bricktown if the city had paid them to do it.   OT - Why is it good for the country for rich people and big giant corporations to get thrown money and crap from the government, but people in need - it's bad?  Just Curious.   One thing I DO have to thank Kirk Humphreys for, if I wanted to go to Bricktown I don't have to pay for parking - I can just park at Bass Pro!

						   Ronald Reagan has died.  Of course, he'd had alzheimers for God knows how long, so actually death was a relief. I really have no positive feelings, memories of the man.  He wasn't 1/10th the man my dad was!   My dad, William Jesse McAbee, born in Clinton, OK, January 3rd(or 4th), 1919.  Loved swing music.  He told me he wanted a Zoot Suit when he was in high school (when I was a kid, his high school was a junior high, but I haven't been back in 20 years), but his mother said no.   His mother, Lib, was the original SuperMom, divorced, raised 2 kids, worked so long for the City of Clinton, when she died, the city declared a holiday.  Had a spotless (sterile) house, and cared for everyone but herself. Daddy was the first to go to college, Southwestern State in Weatherford.  He learned to fly.  He was in the Army Air Corps, later the Air Force.  He told me he was at a movie in San Antonio on Pearl Harbor Day, and was called back to base.  He fixed airplanes in the South Pacific in WWII, and then at Tinker AFB until he retired (bleeding ulsers and hemophilia don't really go together).  I can't tell you much about his first marriage, except it was short and childless. When I was little, I had Mama retell how she and Daddy met all the time.  It's a great story.  Even if it is only one paragraph. Me:  Mama how did you meet Daddy? Mama:  Well, your Uncle David worked at Tinker then.  One day he came home and said, "I've met the Man for you!"  He kept pestering me and pestering me until I just gave up and agreed to go out with him.  Darned if he wasn't right! Me:  (grins) And no, Mama wasn't as good as Grandmother at keeping house, but as I understand it, she kinda lost her temper, and asked him if he liked living in a sterile house.  He had to admit, no, he didn't actually like a house so spotless as to be sterile (I know Grandmother's house was hell for me- you know, the one dirt jumps on).  And while this was Mama's first and only marriage, that doesn't mean she didn't have baggage.  Mama's family.  You know there is not one picture, in Mama's wedding album, of Grandma (Mama's Grandmother) smiling.  Mama said Grandma was afraid she wasn't going to be taken care of anymore.  Daddy got a lifelong partner, Mama got the man of her dreams,  Mama's family got the responsible man who may have wanted to run far away, but didn't. I had a fantastic Daddy.  Not perfect.  Not touchy-feely.  But fantastic - a real renaissance man.  He was into radio-controlled models, first airplanes, then boats.  He painted beautiful landscapes as a kid.  He could build.  He was okay at fixing cars, but usually took it to a mechanic.   Late in life, Daddy told me he regretted not hugging us enough. Oh, Daddy!!

						   I'm bored.  I'm depressed.  I want to go home.  And it's only Thursday.  Make me wish I had Friday and Saturday off again.  I want to sit in my chair and watch tv. period.   I read my regular blogs: Atrios, Kevin Drum, Kos, Pandagon, etc.  I end up thinking, "I'm not worthy to even  read  the comments, much less make one." They're so smart!  I'm so...not.

						   To me and Randy!  10 years today!  And I actually remembered!  Well, sort of.  Yesterday, I realized it was June and our anniversary was soon.  So, I whipped out the ol' marriage liscense (yes, it's been in a succession of purses for 10 years) to verify the date.   TODAY !!

						   I had Monday off.  Too bad I spent the day crying.  I mean, I  CRASHED !!  I know I've gone off before how I don't think Zoloft is completely working, but I think yesterday was PMS.  Today, I've leveled off, while I'm not happy, I'm not unduly sad, either.  So, that's why I was thinking I should've worked.  At least then I'd have a reason to be cranky.  Randy spent the weekend  fishing .  And he wondered why I didn't.

						   My Mother-in-Law is getting better and better every day! My husband is spending most of the day at the hospital. My son is spending the weekend at his Dad's. Yes, he usually works the weekend. He requested the days off a while ago and didn't tell either me or my Hubby. I'm not sure if it's forgetfulness, or willful. The Hubby is pissed.  *SIGH*  I'm down, as usual. As the moon waxes toward full, so does my PMS. Which makes my depression worse. But lately, I just haven't been able to sustain normality (much less be happy). I'm pretty worthless. I seem to always make stupid mistakes.   I am Ms. Not Together, but lately it seems like I've become Ms. Completely Incompetent.

						   Yes, the dog alarm went off at 5AM as usual, so I may have been napping in the recliner, but I was technically up.&nbsp; My son's alarm went of first at 6AM, then at 6:15AM, and at about 6:25 I woke him up so we to go to the Edmond, OK DMV to take the driving test.&nbsp; It takes him forever to get ready, but my dad was that way, too.&nbsp;  When we get to the DMV, My boy was, like, 77 on the list.&nbsp;  That's at freaking 7:30AM!&nbsp;   I learned they had been lining up since 5AM.&nbsp; Anyway, we're in a line, not sure for what, for another 2 1/2 hours.&nbsp; We learn that's the line to make the appointment for the actual test.&nbsp; Damn.&nbsp; The clerk asked me what time I preferred.&nbsp; I said, "Now?!"&nbsp;  He laughed, showed me the days list and said, "I'm sorry, all these people are ahead of you."&nbsp; The earliest we could get was 2:15PM.&nbsp; Now I have to be at work at 12:30PM, the Boy was scheduled at 2PM.&nbsp; The Hubby is stressing over his mother, and has too (too, too, too,  too ) much on his mind.&nbsp; First my son calls his work to see if they would let him come in a little late (he swore they wouldn't), and he explained what it was for and they said yes.&nbsp; (Then his Dad calls and acts like an ass, but that's not news - and it's another post)  Calling my work is a little stickier.&nbsp; I can't just ask for the day off,&nbsp; while I may not be hanging by a thread, I just can't call in.&nbsp; But I have to do something.&nbsp; So I call in to our Workforce Department to see if I can get what's called " Low Call " until 4PM.&nbsp; That's when the volume of calls in are low enough to let people go early (or in my case, come in late) without pay.&nbsp; They said no, so I spoke to my direct supervisor, who at first referred me back to Workforce, I told her I did that, then she spoke to her supervisor.&nbsp; She gave me Low Call until 3:30PM.  We spent more time getting to the DMV, than the test took.   **SIGH**   Right turn on  red   AFTER STOP !  We get to try again next week.&nbsp;

						   I did remember to take my pill today (but forgot yesterday). I sent a little egreetings to some friends about this blog.&nbsp; I'm kind of  out there  now.&nbsp; Yeah, little scary. Hopefully, my son will take his driving test tomorrow morning (those slots fill up quick).&nbsp; And hopefully, he will pass and be a fully liscensed driver (and I don't have to stay up 'til midnight to pick him up at work).&nbsp; The Hubby thinks we'll need to leave the house around 7:00AM, I'm thinking more around 6:30AM.&nbsp; If it's  first come, first served , I want to be first. And everything comes to a standstill on Wednesday.&nbsp; My Mother-in-Law has open-heart surgery to replace her nonfunctioning mitral valve (she's getting plastic).&nbsp; She has to be at the hospital at 5:30AM.&nbsp; Some of the info she received said she'd be getting ready for 4/5 hours.&nbsp; People have these things all the time.&nbsp; She'll be ok.&nbsp; Well, for the Hubby's sake, she  needs  to be ok. And speaking of the Hubby,&nbsp; he's pretty much reached the limit of what he can take.&nbsp; Worrying about my son.&nbsp; Worrying about his mother.&nbsp; Worrying about his low-life brother.&nbsp; Worrying about his own body's decline.&nbsp; I think, for what it's worth, his increase in pain is because of all the stress he's under.&nbsp; If he could just chill, I think his pain would lessen. Right now, I'm not thinking beyond Wednesday.&nbsp; After Wednesday, I'll start thinking again.

						   I was cruising the news, I may be at work, but I like to keep myself apprised.&nbsp; I found  urlLink this article  about Lassiter Drug.&nbsp;    -snip-   "They can get an original refill, but after that they have to go mail-order, and that's hurting our economy more than (the chain pharmacies)," he said, claiming the insurance companies have caused the problem. Lassiter cited a study that several years ago alleged mail-order is more expensive to health care providers than local pharmacies, whether it's a chain or independent.  "There's more wastage – it's 30 percent," he said. "People get a three- or six-month supply today and go to the doctor tomorrow and he changes the medicine, so that's all down the drain."

						   Yeah, I know!&nbsp; When I don't feel like writing is when I need to write the most!&nbsp; And I have forgotten to take my pill for a couple of days (or so).&nbsp; The Zoloft  may  be working better than I think it does.  My Mother-in-Law went to her cardiologist today.&nbsp; She has  urlLink Mitral Valve Prolapse , if you haven't gone to the link, it's the valve between the left atrium and left ventricle, which has caused Mitral Valve Regurgitation.&nbsp; She had an arteriogram about a week and a half ago.&nbsp; It showed that instead of being just leaky, it's stuck open.&nbsp; She's going to have to have the valve replaced.&nbsp;  urlLink Here's a presentation I found about the surgery.   This is kind of knocking the Hubby for a loop.&nbsp; I think the extra stress is wreaking havoc with his arthritis (it  is  an autoimmune disorder).&nbsp; I think I've gone into it before, but he has  urlLink Ankylosing Sondylitis , a form of arthritis that affects the spine, etc.&nbsp; All of a sudden, everything hurts more than usual - spine, shoulders, knees - with no relief.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other things going on at the same time,  family  things.&nbsp; Things that have been going on since the dawn of time.&nbsp; Things that he just needs to  let go  because nothing's going to change, and worrying&nbsp; doesn't help.

						   That's when the dog alarm went off this morning.  And what did he do?  Did he  really  need to walk or potty?  NO!  He had to eat grass and leaves, then vomit.  That couldn't have waited until 5:00 AM?!  Needless to say, I went back to bed.  And yes he did wake me up at 5:00 AM.  He's pretty regular.

						   And then didn't get better.  5:00 AM:  The dog alarm goes off.  What is the dog alarm?  That's when our Basset Hound, Bubba, decided he needed to go potty.  He usually goes off at 5:00, but sometimes at 4:00.  I walk him and the entourage: Rogue the Dachshund, Heidi the Shepard Mix, Whiskers and Midnight the cats. He potties and we come back in and I fall asleep on the recliner for two hours or so.  That's how it's supposed to go.  I get Bubba outside, first I notice the neighbor's dogs are barking (but that's not actually news), then it was like a ghost, a tall, white dog running back to our back yard - Cheyenne the wolf hybrid was loose.  Luckily, she comes when you call.  I put her in the house and wait for my husband to wake up.  I tried to sleep, but no, Cheyenne was too hyper, like a two-year-old child.  And Bubba became Humpy.   So, from 5:00AM to 7:30AM it was, ""No, Cheyenne!"  or "Get off, Bubba!" At 7:30, I openned our bedroom door and Cheyenne and Bubba ran in and jumped on their Daddy.   Sweet relief, since they both love their Daddy!  Cheyenne was put back and fed in the backyard.  I made breakfast.  Then we watched  Once Upon A Time In Mexico  (Oh my God, Antonio Banderas!).  11:00AM rolls around, hubby goes to mow, I'm relaxing on the futon, since I have to leave for work at 11:30(which gives me a 10 to 15 minute window when I get there).  The next thing I know, Midnight the cat is happily purring away, laying on my neck. It's 11:40.  I grab lunch and go.  From Guthrie to Moore is about 43 miles, but I35 all the way.  I notice a shimmy at higher speeds.  I slow down, but it doesn't help.  The car feels like it's skating.  Passing Edmond, I hear a  CLUNK  coming from the back end.  Car noise is louder than normal.  I turn up the radio, but I'm at the freakout point as it is.  The shimmy is getting worse.  Let me say this -  I HATE CAR TROUBLE!   I hear more clunks around SE66th, and I pull over.  No tires flat, nothing looks wrong, I get back in and start praying I can make it to work.  I get into Moore, just north of the Shields overpass, and I hear  CLUNK, FLAP, FLAP, FLAP . Yay.  It's 12:26, my shift starts at 12:30.  I pull over, I discover, that while all my tires do have air in them, the passenger side rear no longer has tread.   Now, I can change a tire.  The only problem I have is loosening the lug nuts (damn impact wrenches!).  I can't the the lugs loosened.  Now I'm crying.  I call my work, tell them I'll be late.  I call my husband, basically to cry, because he's 40 miles away, and unable to help.  Thankfully, a semi-truck driver,with Swift, stopped and changed my tire.  Thank you, Swift Driver!! I spent my lunch, plus an extra hour and 15 minutes, a total of an hour and 45 minutes, at Wal-Mart buying two tires.  So I can not drive home on a temporary tire. God, I'm tired.  UPDATE:  The tires I bought are crap.  I was supposed to buy some other brand.  And why didn't I buy just one tire, these other tires are still good.  Hubby:  Do I have to do everything?   Me:  Tire-wise, Yes! **SIGH**

						   I've been using this blog as a way to spew.  As a person who's normally shy, introverted (and no, that's not necessarily an oxymoron), and depressed (how many years now?), it's cheap therapy.  And although I could, I'm not going to rant again about my health insurance, copays, my ignorant prescription coverage, it serves no purpose.  At least I have health insurance, for now. I am a complete newbie.  I just started reading blogs this year.  I have my regulars,  urlLink Eric Alterman ,  urlLink Kevin Drum  (OT - why are there so many bloggers named Kevin?),  urlLink Atrios , not to mention my boys at  urlLink Pandagon .  I can't help but think that is so cool.  It's why I started this.  Depressed Me says:   I get so frustrated, though.  I'm not nearly in their league, why am I trying?  Who am I trying to kid?  Just who do you think you are?  This is worthless crap.   (please, somebody  stop me! )   Not Depressed Me says:   This is fantastic!  I can say anything I want.  People from everywhere can read it, or not, that doesn't matter.  You know I need to read up on web design and html, I can make this the best damn site nobody reads!   And then I have this genetic hatred of being ignored, I've had it all my life (and yes, I realize the irony of being shy and hating to be ignored). I don't know what I'm trying to say, this post.  My mind is a jumbled mess.  But then, I am Ms. Not Together.

						    Kerry-Edwards!!   Freakin' fantastic!!!  I almost voted for Edwards in the Primary.  You know his "Two Americas" really spoke to me, but I thought he was too nice and the Republican machine would eat him up.  I voted for Dean.  But I should have remembered our last Governors election.  Steve Largent deigned to descend from heaven (Washington DC), to accept the mantle of governorship.  His campaign was considered a juggernaut, unbeatable.  The main opponent, former Republican, restauranteur Vince Orza.  Then out of left field (well, more like center), comes Brad Henry.  His first ads were just basic introductions, himself (then a state representative from Shawnee), his wife (a teacher in Shawnee), and his 3 girls.  You came away thinking, "What a nice guy.  Largent would tear him to pieces."   So, sorry Brad, I voted for Orza in the primary, even though I liked Henry, because I wanted someone winnable.  Brad Henry won the primary and went on to win the election because he's a nice guy, and Largent showed himself to be the nasty, self-absorbed prick that he is.    I guess that's what the difference is in this election.  Since the government is supposed to be "...of the people, by the people and for the people..."  it ends up being a reflection of all us.  What are we showing now?  What do we want to show? I want my government to be about the best of all of us, strength, compassion, tolerance, hope, optimism, resolve.

						    urlLink Here's  the site for the guy I'm actually going to vote for, Brad Carson.  He's still a little too conservative for my blood, but, hey, I'm a blue blue person in a red state, I'll settle.  So, why am I so big on Bob Anthony?  Well, he's the least objectionable of the three.  Kirk Humphreys is just plain  repellant .  Coburn has that hilarious commercial that was produced by Growth for America, and whereever the hell they're from - it's  not  Oklahoma.    Actually, I thought that Bob rode the regulated corporation a little hard.  So, I'm sorry Bob.  I'm an unrepentant  LIBERAL  Democrat, you'd have to do a lot of convincing to get me.

						   Chest tube still not removed. Still has some Atrial Fibrilation. Was told the doctor said may have to shock her heart back into sinus rythym. Yikes! She looks great! She seems to be improving every day. What's going on?  As for me, broken record time, I'm still depressed. I just can't blame PMS or my period for it now. Zoloft bites. Formularies bite. Lexapro works, but I'd have to pay full price for it. So I'm stuck with either things that don't work (Zoloft, Effexor, generic Prozac), or that work but have side effects - well one particular one (Paxil).  You know, I don't mind being Not Together. I don't see that as a bad thing. I just wish...  I was thinner.

Haven't gotten my son retested yet, have practiced a little, but not alot.  *SIGH*  Had a glorious two days of email access at work, but now it's gone.  Blocked by the Powers that Be.  And, while I know this is mostly me being a sore loser, I swear blocking almost everything under the sun is  WHY THE DAMN COMPUTER IS SOOOO SLOW !!!  We had two tech guys here the past couple of days, trying to figure out why our system is so slow.  Hmmm, at the same time, less was blocked.  Now they're gone, everything is blocked again, and sssssllllllloooooowwwww. I guess I can't really complain, well, except how it actually does affect my work.
