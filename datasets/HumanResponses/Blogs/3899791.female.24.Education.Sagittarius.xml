      Well, This last week was a BEATING. We worked and worked and worked. Sleep came infrequently and in small increments.&nbsp; I had about 3.5 hours a night which put me away. Four days at less than 4 hours is out of control. I almost died. &nbsp; However the children were taught. And that is the point. I taught a fruitful lesson on the parts of a paragraph. The model was a hamburger and I ran to McDonalds to buy one for my opening. Great prop! The next day was a bad lesson though...and I got in trouble from the kids for saying 'shoot' and 'heck'. I was so tired that day. Soooooo tired. &nbsp; In the afternoons, after the kids leave, we usually go to our own classes. However on the really tired day they let us leave right after the kids. It was a surprise. They called it TFA....Totally Free Afternoon. I started crying when they told us. &nbsp; My favorite kid, Christopher, sent me into my weekend with a lot of energy when he stuck two post-it notes to his head that read "I love summer school". &nbsp; Our week ended with a huge diversity day. I cried several times that day. Some people don't believe&nbsp;that white privilege exists. Other people become heartbroken to realize and remember that our culture is built on a legacy of hurting one another. &nbsp; I rented an apartment this week as well. Perhaps I will attach some pictures. It's in East Harlem. I love it. It faces a garden. Brick walls, hardwood floors, a loft. A LOT of money. &nbsp; But it's going to be o.k. &nbsp; I got a job for the fall too. Bilingual 3rd grade special education. A rough school. A rough neighborhood. The south, south Bronx baby. &nbsp; I miss all of my friends and family. I'm having the time of my life. &nbsp; -Naomi &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Two years in New York City. It was never actually my goal to move to New York City for two years. As a matter of fact NYC was my fifth choice when I applied to work with the Teach for America Organization. Chicago, Baltimore, New Jersey, and New Orleans and were all higher on my list...but New York it was. New York it is.   I've been here for three weeks now. I love this city. It has been absolutely insane. I have changed and grown more in the last few weeks then I have in a long time. Our institute is out of control. 1000 new teachers waking up at 5:30 am every week day. We teach and take classes until about 10pm with a two hour break for dinner. Usually we have working lunches.  I am team teaching 3rd grade this summer. Most of them are in summer school classes because they failed the standardized test to move to fourth grade. They will have a chance to retake it at the end of this month. We started out with 15 days teaching them...we're down to 12. There is a very strong sense of urgency in the classroom. As a teah...as a class were up against a lot.  Classroom management has been the hardest part so far. Keeping four first year teachers consistent with rules and consequences is a challenge. Last week I made the cutest little boy ever cry...I moved him up from yellow to red on the stop light of consequences.  My heart broke to see his tears fall. As planned I tested his reading. As it turns out he's phenomenal. I told him he was a little genius. I finished that day by huddling up my four student 'team' and telling them that we had to be the quietest so we could be called on first to line up because we want, always, to do our best.  They sat like angels...literally. They were called on for being the quietest and one of the team teachers asked them to show the class how to line up properly. The stress, sleep deprivation, and love all came welling up-all of the sudden I was the one with tears in my eyes. That was the second day.
