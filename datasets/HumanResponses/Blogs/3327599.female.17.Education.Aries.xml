      Lets see now... Today was pretty kool. Slept in for a little bit. Ash came over today so I could drawl her for my Art assignment. She is a pretty good model to drawl. She doesn't move much and when she does she is back in the almost exact same position as she was before she moved. For my summer art pieces I have to do  one was a  self native portrait. Well ash is going to be my model again there lol hey people think we are still twins or sisters. Anyways I am going to make "Me"nude... AHHHHHHHH I know scary thought..... lol nothing really will be shown tho. In the picture I will be holding my knees and there will be chains wrapped around my body  with a pad lock  and maybe some rope in there somewhere. I will also be crying. The point of this piece will describe how my emotions work. I keep all my emotions trapped inside and put on an act of me being happy. I am still trying to decide what I want to do to describe the act of being happy part. It will be fun. After drawling Ash today I went to work. It went super quick tonight. Nothing exciting at work happened... I WORK THE NEXT 6 DAY!!!! YUCKY!but next week I only work like 23 hours, because I am going on VACATION!. I am going to grand lake! I love it there. I am going to lay out in the sun get a tan and swim.....as longish I don't find any snakes again lol.. and fish! I Can WAIT To Fish. I am looking forward to that the most.... oh yeah and the yucky out houses....lol  Last time we went there was a tarancula in the girls bathroom..... and if you don't know me  well enough to know I HATE spiders then aren't my friend lol...... I was like inspecting the whole bathroom before each time I went after that. I think the main thing I am worried about is the snakes. I mean... I hate swimming with fish let alone snakes lol. Last time we went I was snorkeling and I was following a fish and all of a sudden I saw a snake..... I down even remember how I got to the shore...... I just remember seeing the snake and all of a sudden I was on the shore lol. Well anywho I am going to head to bed. I am getting sleeppy! I will try to update my blog tomorrow! I love all you guys!

      Hey people. I realized today that I never want to get old....  Why is it that old people are soo......weird... I mean I love some old people... but most are mean..  One second they will be gripping at you and yelling..." When I was your age."  Well you're an old fart now  so get use to the new generation atleast until you have to go through the pain of getting  you rOTHER hip replace...then you will have something worth gripping about... Today at work this old lady made me soo angry. I was ringing up her item her items I nice go this coupon have a limit you can only get 3 candy bars with this item. She started full out yelling at me... " WHAT?!?!?!? THAT LADY SAID I CAN HAVE ALLL I WANT. I WANT IT AT THAT PRICE! I WILL GET IT AT THAT PRICE!" I got soo POed but I just said calmly to her it is okay I can give you more then it says. She just looked at me your horrid face went into a beaming sweet smile. and then she was leaving she goes thank you *looked closely at my tag* Sheila your a good girl have a great day. "  I want to boot your out of my store.    Then this old man blamed ME for him picking up the wrong battery... like I possessed him grabbed the wrong one just so he would have to walk all the way back and get the right one... Yeah that is me... The possessor...   He goes Why did you give me the wrong  battery  I just said sorry about that and he glared at me and said you should be sorry.  and the nice sweet Sheila I am I was going to say have a good day to him and after I said it he glared and walked out.  But even though I have had my good share of crappy wrinkles old butts, I have had some really sweet old people too. There was this one old man. He was really skinny short walked with a wobble and his eyes were crossed. He was the sweetest old guy.  He would always call me sweety or sugar. He was sweet. but ever since he died the old people have turned into little devils.. I swear to it lol Well that is alll the complaining I have for the day. I Love you guys! Loves Sheila

      OMG! I BROKE A NAIL!!!!! lol no...seriously I broke anail today...lol  I said that said that to my manager and I bursted out laughing.... I AM A GIRL I thought.... Never in my days would I have ever thought I would hear myself complain about  breaking a nail..lol  See I never was a girly girl.... had female parts... but acted like a boy. A tom boy! I use to play with bugs. I remember in 5th grade my "boyfriend" and I would go out to the soccer fields and catch grosshoppers. I use to play with rolly pollies.....well......still do.... but those things are sooooooooooo cute.. lol I was a rought and tough girl. I would play a goally caus eI was the only girl that didnt cry when she got hit in the face with a soccer ball. When I wasnt playing a goally I was passing up the guys by runnig and kicking the ball from them. Dresses and skirt where OUTLAWED at that age to me.... there was NO WAY I was going to dress all girlly... nce I started growing the boobs... I still then said noooooo waay....   BUt after my body began to curve and form I became more interested in girly stuff... but not for me... NO WAY! PLus I was too fat to look good an a dress or skirt. BUt now. I have lost some wait.. DOnt have a flat tummy but my tummy isnt huge! I can wear skirts and look pretty good now. Once I realized that. My down to the quick bitten nails were an embrassment. SO I got my nails done. and now I am proud to say I am a girl!  GIRL POWER! lol... Loves Sheila

      OK here's the thing...lol I am dumping all my friends... I realized it was the best thing to do today...see... I was watching my cousins today and I realized that I had more fun with a 5 and 7 year old then with people MY age! lol No offense to anyone! lol I love you guys .....but these little people understand me...lol *Smiles* It was soo fun...  We were playing jedi... and I was a jedi and I had a pink lifesaver and we were killing bad guys... I like my lifesaver.. anyways..lol .... well I went to the bad side and they both killed me... dead.... to the wet ground.... I meant it was wet? lol and then I came back alive and grabbed one of them and the other one killed me again...lol It was fun.. O I think this 7 year old is smarter then I am ....lol  well he is 7 as I said and he is reading the 3rd Harry Potter book! and had several chapter books already... and finished and 1 and 2 Harry potter.....  but that is not why he is smarter then me....  He was telling me things...Scientific things.... and I was just nodding acting like I knew what he was talking about.... and he was talking about energy and it scared me.....  He would probably make a bunch more then most of this freaking idiot they have on who wants to a millionaire....lol  anyways.....good bye friends.... I love you guys and never well forget you but for now... and am going to be a 7  year old again.... now leave me alone.... or I will tell my mommy! lol Loves Sheila

      This song is stuck in my head. Shinedown- 45  Send away for a priceless gift One not subtle, one not on the list Send away for a perfect world One not simply, so absurd In these times of doing what you're told You keep these feelings, no one knows What ever happened to the young man's heart Swallowed by pain, as he slowly fell apart  And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45, Swimming through the ashes of another life No real reason to accept the way things have changed Staring down the barrel of a 45  Send a message to the unborn child Keep your eyes open for a while In a box high up on the shelf, left for you, no one else  There's a piece of a puzzle known as life Wrapped in guilt, sealed up tight  What ever happened to the young man's heart Swallowed by pain, as he slowly fell apart  CHORUS  Everyone's pointing their fingers Always condemning me And nobody knows what I believe I believe  CHORUS  _ Loves Sheila

       I finished my book finally! It was AWESOME!Trapped...(previously published as 24 Hours) by Greg ILEC... It was sooooo good!.. I have been overly emotional last couple of days so I almost started crying around the end....I didn't want Huey to die.....lol.... Well I worked today... It was soo freakin boring.... but.... then I think my depression kicked in becasue I started thinking about something that have happened recently...that I don't want to share.. and I almost started crying...  then that has made me in a gloomy/ depressed mood all day....  and to top it off I feel sooo alone.....  like when a little girl wakes up screaming in the middle of the night and afriad the monster is going to get her so she curls up in a dark corner to hide..... But wants to scream out for someone to help but cant...because he might find her....  that type of screaming....  but anyways.... more about my books..  I really like the last paragraph... this is what it reads.. "Together they formed a circle that he vowed would never be broken.  He has made such vows before, usually after seeing some tragic death in the hospital, but eventually the grind of daily existence dullef his awareness of the central truth of life.  Chaos was working beneath everything, and death always waited in the wings, watchful as a crow.  This time he would not forget how precious was the time he shared with the women who loved him.  this time he would keep that knowledge close in his heart.   This time....  "  It is about this guy who's a doctor who leaves his daughter and wife at home and goes on a trip and while he is gone on this business trip  this guys kidnaps his little girl for ransom. If he didn't get the money the little girl would die..... IT was so good... and was really suspensionful... I got into it sooooo quick and and I hate to read! lol.. Well anyways.. I am feeling a little bit better now. but I have nothing else to really say..so later! Loves Sheila PS~...oooo yeah... HAPPY 4TH OF JULY EVERYONE!!!

      Ever felt lonely? lifeless? and a strange feeling that everything isnt going on beihnd the scence as you once thought they were? Knowing something is wrong with someone or changed&nbsp; with someone and you cant quite figure it out?&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet TRying so hard to....&nbsp;but still &nbsp;holding back so you dont lose something&nbsp; special? Everything going great.. then day by day it gets worse just trying to grip it close and it slipping away like you were nothing&nbsp;but air?? Hope you never do have to feel these immotional turtors..  signing off Sheila

      "Behind Blue Eyes" by Limp Bizkit  No one knows what it's likeTo be the bad man To be the sad man Behind blue eyes And no one knows What it's like to be hated To be faded to telling only lies  [But my dreams they aren't as empty As my conscious seems to be I have hours, only lonely My love is vengeance That's never free]  No one knows what its like To feel these feelings Like i do, and i blame you! No one bites back as hard On their anger None of my pain woe Can show through [chorus] Discover l.i.m.p. say it [x4] No one knows what its like To be mistreated, to be defeated Behind blue eyes No one know how to say That they're sorry and don't worry I'm not telling lies [chorus] No one knows what its like To be the bad man, to be the sad man Behind blue eyes.  This song is how I feel.. music and all. Loves Sheila

I had a dream about  Ash Tiffannee and me  the other night. We were getting tattoos..lol Tiffanee, no dout, got a huge penguim on her back  I am not really sure what ashley got really... it was some type of scene all I saw was that her back was cover and it looked a widlerness and the guy doing the tattoo ran out of blank ink and told us to come back the next day to finish hers up...as for me I was still deciding.. I think I decided on horses... but when I woke up I was like no way..lol I will show you the tatoo I am getting..it is going to be on my back probaly my low back. My best friend Seth made it for me.. it is an angel and I love angels.. I referr to myself alot in sn as angel something or other... lol.. .I wish my name was angel for a while I want people to start calling my angel... but that would have been wierd... going by something like that after being called sheila all my life.  I called in sick today.. I feel bad that I did take was when we got all of ours stock in... BUt I started feeling bad tuesday night.. wednesday I almost canceled with justin and today I woke up feeling horrible and threw p 6 times before I could stop... my stomach is still sore...lol but I went to the doctor and they told me a have a sinus infections a nd stomach virus and a small fever.. but I am going back to work.. they me a steriod shot in the butt and it seems to be working like a charm and they gave me these pills.. I feel great! lol..except tired...lol ... speaking of that.. I figured out why I was soo sleepy when I was having the killer headaches...lol...I read the direction on the bottle of tyleno... today and it said take one and if head process take two! but dont take more 6 with in a 24 hours peroid..lol  well..lol I took three the first time...lol and 6 hours later took another 3...lol.. I dont think I was awake long enough to took another 3 lol... thank god... cause if that was the cause I might be worrying more then just my sinus infection and my stomach virus...lol OO it was funny at the doctors today...lol ... I was holding back from laughing so hard..lol  because you dont know me by now then you will find out that I probably one of the most perverted girls you will ever meet...lol..... well the nurse came in and she was like ok I need you to lower your pants alittle and lean over the chair..lol.. I wanted to said... O yes ..finally... some action...lol .... but didnt...lol... and my doctor was stupid...lol...I swear...lol but I love her...because she gave me meds that make  feel all better plus some..lol...but.. she was questioning me to try to diaginos what was wrong and she was like...ok and you are sure.. you arent pregegnant...lol... I want to yell at her.... No I was just pulling your leg the first time see if you would stupidly fall for it... I guess you caught me ...my second job you know other then being a beauty advisor at walgreens I am a teenage prostitute. so there is a possibility...lol... I was alittle crabby... and annoyed...lol NOw thinking abotu it I shoudl have said...no... do I look pregnant....you saying I am fat? ....*Cries* ....that is so insentative....lol welll after the steriod shot they made me stay for  15 minutes in the waiting room...so you know... I didnt have a reaction and.. faint...lol so after that I went and drop off my med at walgreens went to the bathroom and noticed I was breaking out in a rash on my face, especially around my eyes and on my back .... so I called them back and asked about it and they told me to take benedryl for it and if start to have trouble breathing then they are open until 9.... I thought o myself ooo great...lol oo ok if I stop breathing it has to be before 9 or I am screwed...lol.. my chest was  hurting alittle but that was about it...so I am still here...alive for the moment..lol.. well considering it is 15 minutes before 4 am I think I am going to lay down I am not really tired by my headache i s coming back I am thin kit is about time to take my med again so I am going to take them and a lay down and probaly read seince I am so awake..lol Nite nite everyone love  you all Loves Sheila PS- Have fun in Kansas ash         Have fun in South Dakota Seth I will miss you guys!

      I got this in an e-mail and i wanted to post it for all my girls..  Women are like apples on trees: the best ones are at the top of the tree. Most men don't want to reach for the good ones because they are afraid of falling and getting hurt. Instead, they just get the rotten apples from the ground that aren't as good, but easy... So the apples at the top think something is wrong with them, when in reality, they're amazing. They just have to wait for the right man to come along - the one who's brave enough to climb all the way to the top of the tree. Share this with other women who are good apples - even those who have already been picked!   And remember ... Men are like a fine wine. They start out as grapes, and it's up to women to stomp the crap out of them.

      I like babysitting at my aunts house.. a little southern comfort from a bottle and a cowboy haha. Note to self: no pie and slow down... He was teasing me about my zippo so he supplied me with matches to help out my addiction. I really think i'm falling for him.. especially after this morning.. I made him french toast lol. And he better feel special cuz no one else got that kinda treatment. I'm exhausted tho. I'm having trouble with the drive it tires me out. We have yet to be on a real date tho.. We just hang out at his house or my aunts. My momma likes him which is big because she doesn't usually like any guys i date..:  "pothead", "controlling", "gay", "leprachaun", "overbearing"... and so on.. But with Chris i haven't heard one bad thing about him!   Anywho.. what else can i babble about? The dog's doin' better.. still a p.i.t.a. but she's too cute for me to be mad at. I need a nap.. or something.. speed.. not really jk. Anywho i'll probably get bored later and need something to do...

      Aren't we all so excited about a 3 day weekend? It's just like the past week.. Well Chris said he might come up today but i just got off the phone with him and he's takin' a nap so i'm kinda bummed i don't get to see him today! Oh well. There's always tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that.. and so on.  So this new puppy thing isn't as exciting as it was a week ago. you guys know i'm not much of a dog person. The best dog is someone else's. Oh well. Tiff's party is tonight and i'm really excited about going. Not sure who all will be there but it'll be fun. So far this summer has been really boring except for the 45 min drive to Morris and the 45 min drive home.. Half the time with my cousin Lindsay who is about to drive me up a freakin' wall. But she's family and you gotta love 'em right? Damn the person who said that first. You've all heard my horror stories about her i'm sure. But now that we've both grown up a little (she's 12) we get along a little better. A little meaning i haven't tried to beat her up in awhile. She did run off and tell Chris that i was in love with him and that kinda pissed me off but what ever. like i said she's 12.. anyway my dog is barking so i should go let her back in.. hopefully she pottied outside like a big girl.. this is really messin' with my head.   So yeah. i hope to see all the girls tonight and i think we should have another night out and attack the poor waiters at On The Border. and not to mention get yelled at by the guys at Fun House for running into the game with all the coins in it.. you're my hero Kristine! and i'm still a little confused about Kramer.. oh well. can't wait to see y'all tonight!

      Check it out.. John's still in bed haha.   I'm gettin' kinda bored with the whole sleeping on the floor thing in Morris.. I had a weird dream last night. It was about Brandon and Chris and i don't really want to get into it but it's buggin' me.. Anywho! I'm starting to miss school. I'll change my tune in about 3 months but that's ok. I start work soon so maybe that will help with the summertime blues. well i'm off for a little more southern comfort and i mean that in more then one way..  Oh! I failed to mention the lady i talked to last friday offered me the babysitting job for her 2 little girls. It's a 7 and 5 yr old. Those are weird ages but i'm sure i can handle them! Alrighty then i'm done for real this time..

      That jingle always made me laugh..  Anywho, it's been awhile huh? John's been hoggin' the computer and i've been in Morris a lot lately or out.. Anyway. Everyone will be happy to hear i got rid of my overbearing p.i.t.a. we called Brandon. He took it too far sat. when he told me our fights were my fault and i just need to stop pissing him off. So i ran off with a cute country boy down in Morris. Y'all know how i like my cowboys!! He is so sweet, and he's real. He is so genuine, he tells you what he's thinkin' and he doesn't play head games.. Or maybe he just has me brainwashed already lol. I tried the whole impressing him thing i'm not sure if it impressed him or just amused him. I held a couple roosters while "Uncle Nate" cut their combs off with a pair of scissors. 2 of the 3 roosters i held got away from me. But oh well. The ride on his 4-wheeler was romantic lol. He was teasing me about squeezing him too tight but well.. That's what i get for being a chicken! Oh and get this! He was in FFA when he was in high school and he was on the livestock judging team! is this a match made in heaven or what?! ;) lol. Well i guess i'll stop babbling about him so that y'all don't throw up.. haha i'm just really happy!  He's about the most exciting thing that's happened this week. That and i got a puppy lol. In that order i promise... ahh my cookies!!!   Time got away from me.. Baking cookies.. I'm turning into a regular little suzy homemaker.. Anywho! Tiff's party is sat. I'm really looking forward to that. Gettin' to see all the girls.. I miss them. Man i'm gonna be such a mess next year. I just can't imagine leaving all my friends. Well anywho.. I need to get goin' i have some stuff to do before i leave for the auction tonight!   (p.i.t.a. is pain in the ass for those of you who don't know) (and the cowboy's name is Chris)

      Well i froze the internet as i was finishing a post and so i have to start over...   i was just babbling about graduation and how it would be funny for Stephen and Angel to be stuck right next to each other and not even know it and that Stephen wants to kill her.. and how school is almost out and in another 12 months i'll be up there in my cap and gown. That's so depressing and so cool at the same time. Makes you think about how much of your life is meaningless. In 12 months no one is going to care who prom queen was. Hell i don't care now lol but you know what i mean.. the whole "omg i need that $300 pair of jeans omg i can NOT be seen shopping at walmart OMG my life is so hard!" all that stuff will seem so stupid and we'll be laughing at ourselves.. and if i'm as good as i think i am you are laughing right now because as always i'm right! i'm not conceited i'm confident darn it..  so i have an interview on friday to talk to this lady about babysitting. should be really cool. she's giving me gas money and big splash passes and money to go shopping with her 2 little girls. this is like my dream job. and speaking of jobs Brandon started his today at some place building ac's and heaters. he called me a little while ago to tell me about all the mexicans he is working with.. he's so racist i'm gonna smack him one of these days.. oh well not everyone can be perfect like me. not even Jim Smith! tho he is the most awesomest person in my head at the moment.. right Amy? hehe.   Well like all awesome things this post must come to an end..

      The last post was actually made on the 12th but I did something wrong and so well it posted it today! Anywho. I'm gonna try to update this as often as I can get online but with my lil brother hogging the computer we'll see how often that is!   I went off roading today! And it was seriously off roading not like Teri's experience through the grass median on the highway! Brandon and I were over at his friend Larry's and well Larry decided he wanted to so we followed. He said he never got stuck and my car should be fine.. OK! Larry's vehicle is a lovely Ford F150! And so knowing me and Brandon.. the dumbasses that we are.. we followed.. For those of you who don't know i have a 98 Prizm. It held up just as well as his pickup! I had mud and grass everywhere, on the sides on the roof inside the car (the windows were down). It was soooo fun.   Anyway! I guess that's it for now! Peace!

      I've been wanting to create one of these for awhile but I haven't because I'm lazy. And well tonight I'm still lazy but also unusually bored. Thank you Amy for sharing this with me. Now I can babble and just pretend ppl read this and care!   Anywho, I don't know what I should put in here.. nothing too exciting happened today. I slept in till 9 and that was the highlight of my whole day. Pretty sad. The highlight of my week would be the banquet. I was recognized for my work with my goats (not that that's a hard job but it was still cool). I finally got the whole boy friend meeting the friends thing out of the way and I think it went pretty well. The blown out tire afterwards was just an added bonus not to mention a nice learning experience for me. What did I learn? I need new tires and a AAA card *grin*. I'm such a girl..   Once I get started it's hard to shut me up. Those of you who know me well or not so well know that hehe. Maybe I talk to much? Nah that can't be true... Well I guess that's it for now. I think I like this more then changing my AIM profile randomly.

      tonight will be unusually short.. i'm not feeling very good tonight..  i cleaned the kitchen today and then sheila came over to check out the animals. after that (around 6) i went to walmart *hey amy...\/\/...* i ran into angel and kevin and hung out with them for awhile. we poured a can of adrenaline in a mickey d's cup and i chugged it as we walked towards the deli where her mom was. and then we went back to the mcdonalds to get a pop and this guy was getting a pop and i'm 90% sure it was the lawn mower kid from the park! but he said he didn't remember me and one of his friends was like "maybe you met him at a titty bar" and angel and i were like dude! that's where it was! that was the night we got wasted.. and kevin got mad cuz "they didn't need to talk to you girls like that". oh well it was all good. then we walked around and they left so i went and found my mommy. we finally left around 9 and came home to pack some more..

      not much has changed since my last post other then i left the house with out being attacked. i went over and hung out with Phil and Heather. when i pulled into the apartments there was this guy leaning against the fence by the pool. and i swear it looked just like Brandon.. i know you guys might think i'm just paranoid lol but then when i turned again through the gate (that is always open so i kinda wonder why it's there..) my cell phone rang and it was Brandon calling me from his cell! i was sooo freaked out lol. what if he really is stalking me? i was just kidding before.. lol.   oh! since i'll probably forget to ask and i'm thinking about it now.. and i'm sure Phil will read this at some point.. do i have to knock? i kinda just come in anyway lol but i don't want to just walk in unless it's ok with you guys ya know.. the whole polite thing.. i wouldn't want to interrupt anything haha.. speaking of that.. where was our little friend tonight? or did i just not notice it..  anyway! we watched the last 10 mins or so of How To Deal and i sat there completely confused because i missed the first hour and a half.. i still want to know why it was a good idea to leave the woman in labor in the back seat while you run into the end of a wedding to get a girl.. after that we flipped back and forth between Freaky Friday and VH1s 40 Greatest Reality Moments or something close to that title.. i was more interested in the arm around me and the cute boy attached to it then i was with Jessica Simpson and her "is this chicken or tuna?" retardedness.. is retardedness a word? spell check says no! ahh who cares.. unfortunately i have these things called parents and i had to leave. Phil was nice enough to walk me to my car tho to make sure Brandon wasn't there to kidnap me.. i kinda think he had ulterior motives.. but that's just a thought hehe

      there's nothing to write about right now i'm just bored.. and that comment from earlier made me think about Julio, Showtime and Roach. hehe it's a shame we all only had that one small get together at the car wash! we know where they live we should go stalk them and yell at them for never calling us.   something i noticed today. my poor cat is a walking sexual innuendo.. he's a 3 legged pussy named BJ. that's really sad for him. i guess.. i dunno.. maybe i just have a dirty mind and my cat is the product of it.   and something else to comment on.. since when did john become the babysitter? i went to the store earlier and being the older sibling it didn't even occur to me i had to tell them where i was going i just told them i'd be back in 20mins. john practically tackled me and grabbed the back of my shirt and refused to let me go until i told him where i was going. so obviously this annoyed me having just woken up from a nap and i was slightly irritable. so i pulled away which only made him jerk my shirt which hurt but i wouldn't give him the satisfaction of knowing that he's stronger them me. thanks john.. how sad is all this? that makes me wonder if maybe she told him to make sure i didn't wander off during the day which pisses me off. what's with my family lately?

      man that conversation got strange real quick... haha... i just really enjoy having random titles so ppl are like "what the hell is she talking about?" and i should get some questions about that one.. and if i don't i'll cry..   ok guys! i have a little more to talk about tonight then i did yesterday. althought i'm still excited about Jamie's almost win yesterday! haha. anyway! i did laundry today woohoo! and out of boredom i made cookies but i never heard anyone complain! anywho. Phil and i went to see dodgeball tonight. it was sooo funny Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn are so awesome. and if you go see it wait through the credits.. the ending is a little disturbing but it's worth it! and then went to dinner and Phil was sooo flirting with the carl's jr lady.. see if i make him any more cookies..   i'm tired. and the boys are fighting over who gets the computer when i leave.. maybe i'll just babble some more so they get to sleepy to want to be on it.. definetly helps wtih the fighting lol. john is using big words to confuse andrew.. like.. shwah.. haha.. and circumsize oh wait maybe it was circumstantial... huh.. oh well.. i just hear what i want! haha. poor andrew.. "circumsize means sissy has a small brain.." i'm just gonna leave that alone for now.. i wanna be an assassin.. haha...

      sooo today was a lazy sunday. and it wasn't because i wanted to stay home. mom decided she wanted to have a family day because she never sees me.. umm hello! we'll be spending a fun filled 10 days together in new york! and every state between here and there.. hopefully i can get out this week and do some stuff with friends before i leave. and i can't take my cell phone with me so if you absolutely need to get ahold of me.. your s.o.l.. you'll just have to hope that i call you. if you stand on your roof and yell really loud i just might here you. i did go to reasors today.. since when is Brooke Mauldin called "Tony"? i've been in there serveral times and it has always said Tony, that is just strange to me..   so i really don't have anything else to say about anything. the weekend wasn't too bad and i get off of work for 3 weeks which is ok with me because i don't really like this work thing.. i just like the money they give me lol.   and the most exciting thing that happened today!! Jamie McMurray (#42) came in 2nd today in cali!! i was sooo happy for him! he soo could have kicked Jeff Gordans ass but i think he was just trying to be nice and make Jeff look not as gay.. good job Jamie! you're so sweet. as for you Jeff.. you should have run out of gas you gay rainbow warrior freak!

      who doesn't know that song?! other then Phil.. cuz.. he's old.. of all ppl Teri should know it.. that and jingle bells.. and john deere green.. and whatever other song might be stuck in her head at any given moment! i miss having lunch together..  soo today was eventful.. i babysat Sam, my baby cuzin, he's so cute but i'm definetly glad i got to send him home! my grandparents came over to whine. janie is having surgery on the 9th and is completely apalled that we are not cancelling our vacation to be here. and she's also upset about me not asking her to take care of my aminals. AND to whine about us going to Houston. i don't know if i want to go.. i'm not saying i like tulsa but it's been my home for the past 6 yrs and its weird thinking about living some where else.. but i guess i did it before right? anyway.. i hung out with sheila for a bit and then i went to Phil's. then we went in search of some arcade.. it's IN the mall.. not BY the mall.. for future reference. and since we never did find it we went and got ice cream instead. i haven't gone out for ice cream in a long time. anyway! after that i took him over to his friends house and i went home!   in john deere green on a hot summer night he wrote billy bob loves charlene letters three foot high and the whole town said he shoulda used red but it looked good to charlene.. in john deere green.. that's stuck in my head.. so is ring ring ring ring ring ring banana phone.. make the madness stop!

      OMG TERI! stop freakin' out lol. no i wasn't talking about ganus that was kinda random.. i was talking about snow or mophat or whatever you wanna call him. and i am soo NOT going back out with him you remember how he treated me. something about a guy calling me "penis" and telling me to "shut the f*** up" all the time is sooo sweet.. did i mention he wanted to run away to vegas with me?? haha! and he said he saw you the other day at the mall but that's not important.. anyway.. he was ok to hang out with but we just didn't click as a couple. and chris and i are broken up for good. i just need to talk his whiney butt into getting his stuff from me because i'm not waiting around for him to get bored and want me back. and that guy you saw me with at the movies like 2 weeks ago or something, Phil.. we're dating now so yeah.. does that help clear up everything about the boys? and about the mexicans.. i did it again today! haha i even let the dogs wander over there so i could bend over in front of them to pick them up! i'm such a DRK i know haha. and maybe a boho.. it probably would have been easier to email you but you never check that and i don't have your aim sn, do you even have one? you need to let me know these things.. don't forget to dehydrate that watermelon this time darn it!  ok now that that's done.. i'm so glad it's friday those girls drove me up the freakin' wall today.. sooo much whining.. i tried to take them to big splash around 11 but they wanted to come over here and play with Sadie and the goats.. so we ended up at the mickey d's play ground and Florence Park. after that fun filled day i went to morris to see Kali and the other kids sing with the church. it was so cute.. really boring.. but still cute! i told christopher i would be there but he was a no show.. so much for wanting to be friends huh? anyway, after that Nate and i decided to brush up on my bird catchin' skills.. you remember my story about the ginnies.. and the parking lot.. and my head and running away from the birds lol.. so anyway he's throwing chickens at me and i was used to herd geese.. finally he chased them behind the shed and i jumped on 4 or 5 of them.. my fav part was when i was holding 6 chickens by their feet and my hands aren't that big lol soo that was interesting.. especially when you have 2 that lean up and peck you.. OH!! i got to see my baby! i'm getting a male boer, he's like 3 or 4 months old. he's all white except for light tan on both sides of his head (including his ears) with a white line down the middle. i'm gonna show him this coming school year (i hope) so that might mean i have to sell one.. i'd rather keep Twist and sell Abby but if i sell Twist i can breed both my females and make some extra cash. especially cuz pygmies have a history of having twins.  sorry about the mindless aggie babble.. it's been a long ass week. oh! that reminds me, i'm going on vacation but since i don't want random ppl to know where i'll be or how long my house will be empty.. you will have to ask me about it.. which brings me to something else.. anyone feel like pet sitting for me? 3 lovely goats 3 cats and you wont have to worry about the dog i can drop her off in morris again unless anyone has a better idea!   i just reread this and got bored.. how sad.. lol

      i couldn't remember if i used that title or not...  and a note to Phil: buy me that hat and i'll buy you all the Olsen twins posters Phil JR can handle! haha. remind me one day and i'll show you a baby pic of me, i look like them when they were on full house. but i don't anymore because i'm not anerexic!   so i didn't do much today. i hung out with the girls and we watched animal planet and played outside and watched The Haunted Mansion. so omg the neighbors are having work done on their house, they were doing stuff with the yard and what not yesterday and today they had ppl working on the roof. so all morning we heard them banging around. Hannah asked if we could go outside so we did. the second i stepped onto the porch something didn't feel right.. i just had this weird feeling. and then it hit me. it was silent outside aside from some birds chirping. i looked up and every single one of those guy had stopped what they were doing and were looking at me, and grining and a couple were waving. so i waved back and said hey! lol. OMG it was soo funny. the girls had a friend over today and his mom use to be a translater for some company.. anyway she asked if i spoke spanish (which makes that 2 ppl in one week so maybe i should learn). and then she followed it with a "omg i'm glad you don't.. those guys... omg..". so i made sure every time i walked by i smiled up at them. all i could think of was teri saying "stop provoking them!".   anyway another thing to babble about. i stopped by to see brandon today. i'm not sure why but i did. and it wasn't that bad. he was fun to hang out with and i realized that we never really acted much like a couple in the first place, we never held hands, he never held me, we only kissed good bye.. which makes me look at the relationship i have with Becky! we're always holding hands and kissin' and all that lol. i love you gurl! anyway i can't think of one person that would read this and think "cool ashley and brandon are friends again" but i don't want you guys to freak out. he'll be ok, i trust him and i want you guys to trust my judgement even tho i've made some mistakes in the past.. we all do it and you know that..

      so i spent almost $200 today and it wasn't my money.. know how awesome that is? lol. i spent a couple hours at big splash and ran into some ppl i know. mostly kids from before/after. and then after that i watched Mary Kate and Ashley Getting There.. and no it wasn't to rehab! what a loser.. she has everything and she's starving herself? god i wish i was rich and famous.. MOVING ON. i have absolutlely nothing to talk about tonight. my day was boring. but i don't have to like seriously babysit tomorrow, this little boy up the street and his mom are coming over and she's really cool. she was over a little today and we talked. so that's cool.   i decided today i want a hat. i will probably get that friday or sat after i get paid. i like hats and i'm tired of having to resort to 'borrowing' them from guys. i want my own darn it. i really liked Brandon's gray OSU hat but the only thing keeping me from buying is the fact that it would remind me of him! so that's my goal for this weekend.. buying a hat..  I'm Ashley.. and i approve this blog.

      OMG how do you ppl handle getting up early all the time? i got up at like 7:45ish... lol and i'm exhausted. i didn't even do anything today. at 11 the girls and i came over here to mess with the animals and we managed to lose a toad in the house for 45 mins.. haha.. and then we went to mcdonalds where some lady babbled spanish to me until she saw i looked confused and in better english then me said "oh.. do you speak english? i'm sorry do you need this?" and held up an application. she thought i was there to apply for a job.. as i sat there drinking my pop.. and trying to get the girls to eat.. do i look hispanic? anyway.. after that we went to the park for like 3 hours.. but that's ok because they had fun and i got to talk to this cute guy who was there with his cousin. we started talking about work and stuff and that's when that line came up "i mow lawns" it just sounded funny.. he was nice and he hung out with me for like 30 mins and then i went home.. and locked my keys in the car.. but i had to go to the bank so now that has to wait till tomorrow..  funny story about the bank! i haven't balanced my check book since.. march.. and i haven't deposited any money since my last pay check 3 weeks ago.. so yesterday i used my check card every where i went like the dumbass that i am! so i got online and checked it and had to add in some stuff that didn't clear yet and i found out i have like a dollar and some change HAHA how good am i?? hopefully i didn't forget anything..   i feel like having a 3rd section but i have nothing else to talk about.. not that anybody is reading this anyway.. you can wake up now i'm done.. btw you have something right there.. ya missed.. there ya go

      silly me i had no idea where that was from.. i'm soooo sorry Phildo.. i mean Just Phil..  So yeah i went back to work today but i only had one kid so it was ok/boring. we went and hung out at the mall and it was cool to see the looks i got from guys until they saw the 5yr old tugging on my hand HAHA. stupid boys. anyway after that i dragged Phil and Sadie to southern ag. silly unsuspecting furry friends.. i didn't know what to say.. Sadie got stabbed in the butt and Phil had to carry my goat feed hehe. anyway so i went home and no one even asked where i was going tonight.. didn't even act liked they cared.. so i left.. hung out with Sheila for awhile at walgreens and then i went to Phil's and then went to a pool hall. and then i came home!   i know how all of you think i talk just to hear my own voice but damn it i'm not alone!! and it's nice to know i'm not the only one who babbles incoherently all the time.. Adam (this guy i met) does it too! and let me just say boys.. changin' that tire turned me on.. and then y'all feelin' each other up at the pool hall.. damn i woulda done all three of you on the table.. jk! haha i'm tired..

      i went to morris yesterday to celebrate Nate winning custody of Kali.. and Chris told me he wanted to see me when i went down there.. so i borrowed Nicks truck (i love it.. baby blue ford ranger. i look better in it then he does..) to go down to his house. well when i got there i parked behind a white suv and had no idea who's it was.. so i walked over to Chris's truck where he was standing with... MEGAN! the crazy ex gf. i was.. thrilled to see her. Christopher took off and ran into the house and left us out there alone. she just sat there giving me dirty looks and i just smiled because i knew if i didn't i would strangle her. so she got on her cell and i went in the house where Chris was hiding. ya know that look a dog gets when you beat it for pissin' on the floor.. that's what he looked like and ALL he had to say was "kinda uncomfortable huh?". now remember when i said we broke up for reasons i couldn't talk about? this Megan bitch told him she was pregnant which is a bunch of bull shit (i shoulda rubbed her belly and been like "ooo feel that kick? it's gonna be a soccer playa!" too bad i was too mad to do that..) so anyway he's seeing her again i guess, i was soo pissed off. he said they aren't dating but whatever.. maybe they are just fuck buddies. i told him to come get his shit this week and he acted all sad and sounded like he was really upset and said he wasn't in a hurry to come and get it because he wants to be my friend and wants to try again later. i don't really want to beleive him but it's that damn crap with me and trusting and not wanting to hurt ppl that wants to believe him.. damn it i'm gettin' mad all over again. oh well.. i don't care anymore. he can be an asshole. it's guys like him that make me want to be a lesbian. grr.. oh well i'm done with him. all i can do is move on and just hope the next one doesn't screw me over.

      and no i'm not talking about Jeff Gordon's car...   Ok so nothing happened today.. and by nothing i mean.. i wasted 2 hours of my life at walmart and got stared at by older guys and attacked by little mexican kids. no matter when i go to walmart there is a hispanic family with 4 or 5 kids.. and the youngest one is pushing the cart. and not doing a good job mind you. it's usually into the aisle or my ass.. and what's with the random ppl asking me if i've been saved. if someone would save me i wouldn't be talking to lunatics at walmart! i probably wouldn't be at walmart period.. but they offer to pray for me and hope that i live a good life... moving on.. about these guys.. omg why are breasts so cool? i think i'm gonna say something to the next guy i catch looking at them.. like "yours are bigger.. i'm jealous!" or "stare long enough and they'll do a trick" or my fav come back of all time.. "yer mom" (only the special ppl i know will get that.. the rest of you well you suck). i'm gonna start going around staring at guys dicks.. but see women have more couth and we can refrain from degrading them.. in front of their faces.. haha. i love boys. they are so cute. how much fun would it be if they were perfect?    ok so if you lasted this long you get to read some funnies i found... at least i thought they were funny but i'm easily amused..    ~How come we choose from just two people to run for president and 50 for Miss America?  ~A good friend will come and bail you out of jail...but, a true friend will be sitting next to you saying, "Damn...that was fun!"  ~I signed up for an exercise class and was told to wear loose-fitting clothing. If I HAD any loose-fitting clothing, I wouldn't have signed up in the first place!  ~When I was young we used to go "skinny dipping," now I just "chunky dunk."  ~Wouldn't it be nice if whenever we messed up our life we could simply press 'Ctrl Alt Delete' and start all over?  ~Wouldn't you know it...Brain cells come and brain cells go, but FAT cells live forever.  ~If you can read this, thank a teacher....and since it's in English, thank a soldier.

      could ya tell i missed my titles? or as John calls them tit-els.. weirdo.. so yeah! i went and saw Shrek 2 tonight i highly recommend it for everyone! it's an awesome movie. we're sexy! i was born that way i don't need a magic potion! i went to see it with Phil. and i ran into Jermy (ashby) and some other girls that i think are bitches so it doesn't matter! the fairy godmother was a little dirty.. talking about sexy tushies.. bad godmother.. so while no one is reading over my shoulder i can add that after the movie Phil and i went back to his apartment and woke up his room mate i'm sure she was very thrilled with that. then we watch Aqua Teen until i had to leave. this curfew thing SUCKS. there is so much more i want to say but.. i can't.. cuz.. suprisingly enough some ppl do read this.. and i don't want someone to know something but i think that someone knows the thing i don't want that person to know but that's ok cuz i kinda want that person to know what it is that i want to say!    haha+lol=hehe

      i don't understand why dogs feel the need to chase their tails. do they forget they are back there? i don't get why my dog chases it until she gets ahold of it and pulls on it until she makes herself fall over...   i need to get my senior pics done.. i haven't even made an appointment yet. is that bad? dude you got a dart in your neck.. is that bad? speaking of that i haven't seen Angel in awhile.. we should do something this weekend. i think i'm going to bells on sat. for my aunts company picnic.. as of right now it's her and my family so if anyone gets too bored i suppose i will allow you to hang out with me..   yes it's true.. i'm a stalker.. but i learned from the best!

      so it wasn't as bad as i thought! we actually had fun. we had steak for dinner, it was soo good. then we went to the show, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. it was a cute show (with cute boys). they tried to force us to watch it in class last year and i rebelled. haha i never follow directions.. Sheila came with me so i wouldn't get bored and i learned my daddy doesn't love me! totally ignored me.. talked to sheila.. oh well. i always liked the mail man more then him anyway..   so yeah.. there's really nothing else to talk about!

      if you haven't seen the "Girls Lie Too" music video you HAVE to watch it or at least listen to the song.. it's sooo funny. (it's by Terri Clark.. she's my hero). i love that song because y'all know we lie to those silly boys all the time.. hehe.   there isn't too much to talk about right now.. i'm just really bored. i'm going to the Warren Place Tenant Party tonight.. at Discoveryland. i'm sure it'll be your typical tenant party.. i read a little about it earlier and it didn't sound too interesting.. line dancing and 2 step, with a live western band.  native american dancing, and the audience is encouraged to join in on the Friendship Dance.. and y'all know me.. i'll probably get up there lol. anyway! that part sounded crappy but the tickets were covering up the top half of the sheet and i didn't bother to move them and read it... theres gonna be a big BBQ. "Wild West Fun"? what's that exactly? calf-head ropin' rodeo roper, and a mechanical bull ride, i think i have to do that.. just to see how long i'll last. but that's the thing about dating cowboys.. 8seconds is a good ride to them.. the lesser fun stuff.. haystack treasure hunt, volleyball, jupiter jump.. lol oh and pony rides! yes! i made the list too! for some reason i'm under dessert.. "cowboy's dream".. i taste good with whip cream! haha. ok well i'll let y'all know how it was later tonight.  as an after thought.. i got my cell phone bill today.. i'm sorry to say it was only 11 pages this time.. i'm trying soo hard to break my record of 12 pages.. so close.. my month started over tuesday tho so call me!!

      i don't know how to start this.. so i'll just start babbling like i have been all day! Sheila and i went to China King for dinner, it was sooo good. i love chinese food. after that we met Phil at the mall and he did some shopping (you still didn't buy my a present *pouts*). awesome poster btw.. johnny depp.. hehe. anyway. after that we went and picked up some hookers.. oh wait.. Sheila and i were the hookers.. anyway! we went to King Tat where i ran into someone i know.. i think she was really suprised to see me in there! then it was off to fun house to play. Sheila and i ran off and played some games and then Phil found us and i totally kicked his ass at Soul Calibur II.. haha.. no not really.. but i tried!! i beat Sheila at air hockey.. well after all that we got bored and Sheila went home so Phil and i went to his apartment and you guys can fill in the rest.. that would work if i didn't have such a large group of perverted friends! i stayed for like 2 mins and had to race home so i wasn't late! so yeah that was my day other then washing my car.. and giving the dog a bath..

      well today went a little better then yesterday! i didn't get hit.. which is a plus in my book. i went and got the dog.. i was supposed to see Chris but well it was some more excuses and blah blah crap. i told him to call me later if he felt the need, hopefully he knows i'm pissed (boys can be so dense sometimes). i still have his class ring so he kinda has to see me again eventually hehe.. maybe i'll let claire play with it.. moving on  i never really thought about ppl reading this because i didn't think anyone cared that much.. so seeing that Phil left a comment i guess that means i have to be careful about what i say on here about him.. i can't say how weird he his.. or anything like that.. nah i'm jk you're cool! and thanks for reading about my boring life lol. We went to see Starsky and Hutch tonight. it was an ok movie.. Owen Wilson is hott haha. he needs to do something about that nose tho.. what's with me and noses? is that some mental thing? oh well, i always knew i was special! we ran into Teri and Jacob at the theater and of course Teri used her secret girl talk to ask if Phil was my bf.. she whispered "is this the new bf?".. he totally didn't get it.. silly boys. she's such a dork lol. i just realized i didn't even say hi to Jacob.. or did i? i don't remember..   and an update on the stalker.. the new gf dumped him, the ex gf is pregnant (NOT ME!!).. and he wants to talk to me because i make him happy..

      those snickers commercials are driving me crazy! they are just making fun of little old ladies trying to tell them that the only way they can get guys is by giving them candy. ppl go to jail for that sort of thing!! well.. if they let them out.. i only made that mistake once..  so i went to fun house tonight! i got to meet Phil. he's really cool. i watched him play ddr.. omg i have never seen anyones legs move like that before. John has been teasing me all night about Phil.. that's what brothers are for! and for once in my life i didn't have my zippo on me.. when i got home i lit stuff on fire to say sorry for leaving it behind.. yay pretty fire. (*note to self get more fluid*)  so while i was there Chris called and interupted my air hockey game with Andrew (i still won 7-4 haha) he said he would try to see me tomorrow when i go pick up Sadie. i'm kinda thinking about telling him not to bother. how crappy is that? "I'll try to see you". bull! i'm not gonna be the convienent girl friend.. ya know the one that's just there when they want you there and gone when they don't need ya.. what about me? i know this sounds crazy but sometimes i need someone too. i hate being the one that fixes everyone's problems because that just means i have no one to help with mine.. and i hate that none of my bfs ever want to just hang out. it's like all we do when we're together is make out.. that really sucks! stupid horny boys! i want to have a guy who will sit down and watch a movie with me. and i mean WATCH it the whole thing even if it sucks. sorry about whining tonight guys. i'm just annoyed at the fact that the guys that like me never treat me right..

      So i had an exciting monday! i woke up this morning around 4am to Brandon sounding like something was wrong but he wouldn't tell me what and said to call him later.. anyway around noon i decided to stop procrastinating and get my phone fixed.. so i'm sitting at a stop light and last time i checked you stop at them when they are that reddish color.. well the lady behind me deicded ahh what the hell stopping is so boring these days.. so yeah i got rear ended. kinda annoyed me mostly because the Pepsi truck driver next to me was cute and i was thirsty.. not too bad tho, it just crunched my bumper a little.. we hope. mom said it could have messed up my rear axil and all that..

      so i got back from Kansas today. i had a lot of fun for once! we had a nice little hail storm so of course i have pretty dents on my car now but that's ok. so we went to the movies right? and the only theater that i know of is in the mall.. ok that mall could fit INSIDE the dillards at woodlandhills.. and it's only one story.. omg it was amazing to be able to walk from one end to the other in under 1 minute. so anyway.. we were talking about the hott guy in The Buckle and i was trying to talk Heather into talking to him because she'll never see him again when this guy on the bench laughs and starts talking to me! lol he was kinda cute but a little weird. he was 23 and with his friend who was 25. the 4 of us went to see The Chronicles of Riddick (we sat 2 rows behind them lol). that movie was like lord of the rings meets the matrix meets star wars! i only went for vin deisel... haha.   the main street in this town isn't even equivalent to 71st.. the speed limit.. was 20.. i wondered why i smoked a mustang full of middle aged mexican men who were whistling at Heather and me.. it's because i took off and they were obeying the law! weirdo kansas ppl..   oh and Chris called me today! that was really exciting i missed him. i'm going down there on tuesday to see him!

      just so everyone knows how bored i am.. i looked it up..  Jennifer Lopez is a leo and her horoscope (suprisingly enough) says "Anything that begins now won't be going anywhere". So maybe there is something to this horoscope thing..   and this was just interesting...  My goddamn rock solid ghetto shiznit name is  Ass Machine Weed .  urlLink What's yours?

      Horoscopes are funny don't you think? They never seem to say the same thing and they always seem to know exactly what's going on in your life.. maybe everyone who is an Aries has my same issue today.. i highly doubt that but you never know. so today it tells me "one word, one glance or the right gesture and you'll be back in love again". and then it continues to tell me to wait at least 2 weeks before going to vegas. (is J.Lo an aries?) to me that doesn't help because i extremly like (not love..) ppl really quickly. i'm awesome like that. and then my flirt part of it goes on to say i need to explore new territory... Pittsburg here i come..

      that picture thing made me crazy.. anyway!   i'm in kansas to visit family. tomorrow my cuzin Heather will be up and we're gonna cruise around and pick up guys haha! i haven't gotten to scope out Pittsburg boys yet. hopefully they're better then Jenks boys. i'm starting to think i have a one track mind.. boys boys and more boys.. oh well. so it sounds like i might be spending more time at fun house.. Sheila introduced me to this guy and he seems like he'd be awesome to hang out with. but probably not monday.. cuz i think i have a date that night.. i really don't think i want a bf right now. i'm tired of getting hurt and stalked.. speaking of stalkers i haven't heard from Brandon since wednesday night! maybe he gave up.. but then again he's in arkansas so maybe he'll start up again when he gets back..

      Ok so i just lost almost 2 hours of my life.. 2 hours that i really wish i could have back.. but i can't.. Damn Bill and his crazy murderous hott chicks. that movie was pretty bad i never knew ppl bled that much.. makes me want to get a paper cut so i can repaint my room.. moving on.   i didn't have to work today which was good and bad, i'm still getting paid the full amount for the week and i got to sleep in today. so what was the bad part? i don't remember.. anyway! man i'm tired and really have nothing to babble about. this is a first for me you should all write this down and treasure it.. or.. something..   Chris called me last night. it was really nice to hear from him, he promised to call me today. We will see.. I'm excited about being out in the dating world again i missed it the last 2 months.. i wanna know how i didn't die my first what was it? 15 yrs not having a bf lol. now i can't handle being single for 2 weeks. Brandon is still sniffin' around and i want so bad to tell him to go away but i like knowing he wants me.. i'm mean..   we don't really need men. i mean just think about it. i have a job i have a car soon i'll be moving out. i have BJ (my cat you sickos) do i need a man? sure i want to have kids but.. all you need is those little white tadpoles.. so what happens if one day.. women take over the world.. and we could have like cryogenetically frozen men that you could just go by at walmart or something.. how cool would that be? i know i'm sadistic thank you.   i'm jk and if i've offended anybody.. well.. nothing i can do about that now! for real tho unfortunetly i have this need to feel needed. and i like having someone there who needs me it's this stupid motherly thing i have where i have to help and fix everyones problems.

      so i haven't been here in awhile..  Sunday evening Chris dropped some.. nice news on me that i'm not allowed to talk about.. call my mom she knows lol. i hate that i can't lie to that woman... anyway we decided (well HE decided) it was in our best interest to just date for now. but i'm ok because i understand the whole "needing space" thing and needing time to get over someone, him and his ex were together for 3 years. and even tho i think she's a bitch.. i still understand his need for closure. which is something i still need from Brandon. he never stopped calling me.. it's weird to tell him to bug off when he spent almost 2 months telling me he loved me, and the last 2 weeks telling me he wanted to marry me. i just don't want to hurt him ya know? and part of me likes it because it makes me feel wanted and needed and that's just my own pathetic little thing.. ANYWAY!! for all you males reading this! i'm currently available for your dating needs! i'm hoping Jon calls me because i lost his number... wanna know how? funny story really..  as most of you know i started babysitting on monday. it's been interesting.. don't get me wrong the girls are just awesome. they talk back a little but what kid doesn't these days? anyway.. So i'm in the kitchen today drying dishes when i hear this odd clinking noise right? sounded almost like glass and then a gasp followed by an "uh oh". with a "hannah!!" and a "go get Ashley" "no you get her" "you did it!!" and then i hear the slow footsteps of Claire (she's 5).. "Ashley.. umm.. i.. umm.. *looks around* i.. i dropped your cell phone.. in.. the toilet.. and... you need to get it out.." that's when she panicked i guess she thought she was in trouble i just thought it was funny.. anyway! it's on and all that.. but the screen doesn't work.. so if i don't know your number by memory then well.. you'll have to call me! hopefully i can take it in tomorrow to fix it.. i forgot the best part.. while i was drying my phone Hannah says "you better wash your hands" i said i planned to and Claire finishes it with "yeah my daddy took a big 'ol dump this morning!".. ahh kids..

      It's been a loong weekend.. Went to Morris yesterday. Made some cookies for my boy before i went (of course). I hung out there at the house for awhile and then Chris and i got rid of all the kids.. went to his house.. and ya know.. hehe. no not really lol. we ran into town and headed back over to my aunt's. I made dinner for the 2 of us and he left around midnight. i'm a little concerned with the cooking thing.. i've made him breakfast.. dinner.. and cookies.. and this is only week 2 of the relationship.. this is not the normal gf thing when it comes to me.. i don't know what's gotten into me. and i'm enjoying it! that's the part that worries me. i really like this one guys. and i just hope he feels the same way about me. i'm really really scared. this is probably something i shouldn't talk about on here but oh well. i just don't know what to do ya know? i know he likes me and we get along awesome. we argued a little yesterday but it was all in good fun. it was over who was gonna make dinner and i was grinin' the whole time.. i think he thought i was mad but i was annoyed at the oil for not heatin' up quicker and i needed to have some girl time with the phone and he and Nate wouldn't get out! lol.   why is it that boys drive me absolutely insane.. all of 'em.. and for some reason i want them around lol. there's one in particular that i want around a lot more often..   all i have to say now is.. trampoline.. hehe..

AWWW HOW CUTE!! i'm a little ummm hyper... and sometimes I freeze the pills and it's like eating a bunch of ice cream. so I put all the pills in a giant carton, and i put a little bit of milk, and then... and then i wait a couple hours, i take it out of the freezer, and then i get a spoon and then i just start eating it. er.. some of the side effects to the medication i take are either nightmares, and sometimes diseases, and sometimes diarrhea, constipation, bleeding from the eyes... my ears ache... sometimes, i get headaches, migraines... death... but i got pills to cure the death, so i take those and it... and it off-sets the death effects.  and NOW you're thinking "omg she pops pills".. but.. but.. why would you say that i "pop" them? i don't pop the pills, i take them and i eat them. i put them in my mouth and i swallow them and then they stay in my tummy and go turn colors and make them go larger, and then all of a sudden my diseases are cured for a short time until I have to take more pills...  now for some seriousness.. yeah.. me.. serious.. whatever! anyway! those were lines from my lord and master Foamy.. actually from his friend Pillz-e whom i love and is my hero!! www.illwillpress.com you will not be sad you went.. and if you don't laugh.. you are a freak and i don't want to talk to you ever again.. jk i will still love you even though you are weird! chances are.. i already know you are weird.. MOVING ON! it's friday and tomorrow is saterday and i have yet to decide if i'm going to Morris tomorrow or tonight.. dilema.. i dunno.. what to do.. maybe there's a pill to help me decide.. a deciding pill.. i wonder if it's purple.. the purple one makes it all better...  ok i'm done being weird!

      i went out with my flashlight.. and saw nothing.. no quarter.. now i'll have to pay the extra 25 cents by myself! haha jk it was fun and besides i started it.. i threw doggie treats at Teri and Amy.. and Kristine.. I would be lieing if i said that was the first time anyone has thrown things at my car.. Jacob threw stuff at my car.. or was it just Teri and me throwing pop tarts at his van.. i'm pretty sure he threw things too! anyway.. and then there was Nick and Andrew throwing ice (followed by the empty Wendy's cup) AND then some pennies..

      OMG!! it has been soo hard not to talk about Amy's party but now i can! I'm sooo glad it came together as awesomely as we had hoped! She was totally suprised and Amy it is soo awesome to see you enjoyed yourself! except the whole Jimmy Scott incident.. but like i said that's not even a Jenks number! 733-XXXX is like Okmulgee-Morris-ish. AND i looked it up and couldn't find it so either he made it up or it's unlisted! haha. i love the internet. ANYWAY i hope you like the shirts. I was trying to be creative.. You probably wont ever wear them lol but that's cool! just know that we love you and we don't want you to leave. and you better come see us! I think our senior trip will involve the 7 of us driving to Louisiana and staying at Amy's! (jk i know it's Alabama..) Make that 8.. we'll kidnap Andy and bring him too hehe! OH CRAP i forgot about that quarter.. i'll go do that as soon as i post this.. I'm a whole 25 cents richer and i'll put that towards a new paint job! because SOMEBODY i wont name names TERI AND AMY threw coins at my hood...  So last night wasn't enough for me i guess with the dude on 71st trying to kill me i had to do it again tonight.. This time it wasn't my fault! 2 ppl were chasing each other and i got in the middle of it YAY ME. I never was accused of being the bright one in the group! So anyway.. i almost rear ended him because he went from 60-0 in like 2 secs and i wasn't paying attention..

      i'm giving up on the whole title thing i can never think of anything to put there.. Anywho.. after reading Amy's post from this morning i have been wondering.. am i one of the hott friends Matt was referring to? i bet i was haha! jk. that would be cool and would definetly inflate my ego (like i need any help with that..) It's a shame he has to leave today he seems like he's a really cool guy and he reminds me of Aaron McQuarry like you wouldn't believe.. my dog is stuck..  why is it that the same 3 ppl are always online...

      anyone else ready for school? or is it just me? those of you who actually work enjoy your days off but me, i'm just bored. i think next summer i'm gonna look into a big ppl job (haha). mom said she could help get me a job with Citgo. everytime i think about Citgo i remember how Ms. Crook's neighbor stuck his head in and announced the Citgo relocation and i remember Amy and Natalie freaking out "omg i'll have to drive so far to get gas now!" "i hate QT and their closing the Get'N'Go's too!" of course anyone with a higher IQ then Jessica Simpson knew it was the company not the gas station... anyway!  last night i went with Phil and John to see The Village. Teri and Jacob met us there. i really hope he isn't still weird about what happened with us. he didn't really say anything to me but when i think about it we were never big talkers anyway! oh well.. it seems like everyone has moved passed that, and i really missed hanging out with those 2. ok so about the movie.. it wasn't that scary and i recently discovered why a lot of scary movies dont bother me that much.. it wasn't the 100 yr old armadillo/porcupine monsters that scared me.. it was the 22 yr old italian grabbing me when i wasn't paying attention.. it wasn't the worst movie but it wasn't the best either. anyway after that the 3 of us went to mcdonalds and then John and i went home and watched Law and Order SVU. i'm starting to think it's an addiction...  ok so i was talking to my parents about somebody bringing a little kid to the movie last night, and they told me they let me watch Child's Play when i was about 18 months old. they didn't think i would sit and watch it but i did. they didn't think i would understand what was happening but i did. they said i sat there the whole time i watched it and i use to chase them around like i was Chuckie pretending i had a knife. young parents aren't they cool? lol. that also helps explain why i never played with dolls when i was younger.  one more thing and i think i'm done.. i got my senior pics today. they look horrible.. there are a couple i like and i'll try to get those posted soon.. but we'll see.

       wanna know something funny about&nbsp;hate.. it takes so much emotion and time. another feeling like that is love. so love and hate really isn't that different now is it? so the previous statement has nothing to do with anything other then being completely consumed by hatred is a horrible way to live. it's better to just let go and not care anymore, indifference is healthier then hate. dont hate me, just dont care.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  ok so now that i&nbsp;said that.. yesterday Sheila and i went to the vet that was fun. and after that Phil and Sheila and i went to see Napoleon Dynamite. it was really funny. the FFA comments were greatly appreciated. it made me realize that in all our movies about high school it's always about jocks and cheerleaders and geeks. what about our future farmers? none of us really fall into&nbsp;any of the previous categories.. some of us can be considered "special" lol but that's about it. how do we spell girl Kyle? gril? and what about respect? respcept? Aretha Franklin would shoot him if she knew how bad he butchered that song... i'm really gonna miss Redneck Ray and Banana Head this year. who will we make fun of.. oh i know! Teri! lol jk. ok so anyway, after the movie i went to Phil's. we went to walmart around midnight which was really funny.. and stood in line forever because no one knows how to work those self checkers. anywho around 1 this afternoon i decided i should drag myself home. only to take andrew to blockbuster. i spent the rest of the afternoon watching mortal kombat and playing the legend of soltar.&nbsp;(aka solitaire&nbsp;for those of you who are retarded).

      I made a Quiz for you!  Take my Quiz!  and then  Check out the Scoreboard!   so i made this cuz i was bored. and then i forgot to save the link.. so i had to redo it to keep my mind off some other stuff..   ppl never cease to amaze me. someone is always doing something shitty to rile up somebody else.. it's like no one is happy unless they are pissing off at least one person. hell i've been there, yeah it was funny to piss off some of John's friends on AIM because they didn't know who i was, but when you fuck with them at a really personal level.. that's taking it too damn far. it doesn't make me feel better about myself to tell someone their bf or gf is cheating on them or using them or anything like that, i dont know anybody who gets some sick pleasure out of fucking with someones emotions.. you have to be a really sad person to get a kick out of that.

      ok so it's monday.. i hate mondays.. its not like i have anything to do today lol but i still dont like them. anywho. yesterday was a lot of fun. mom and i went shopping and cleaned out her van. we went to sonic and freaked out the carhop, that was funny..   so i decided inviting Phil over for dinner would be a good idea since my family really isn't all that bad (plus i wanted an excuse to see him lol), but that was before i knew my grandparents and Nick were going to be there too.. Nick is ok cuz he's retarded and fun to hang out with. but you guys know how grandma Janie is.. we hid in my room after dinner since i knew our presence in the living room would be ignored because she craves attention and gets mad when the attention is on someone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;  apparently all we missed out on was her whining about my aunt being&nbsp;a bitch,&nbsp;and how she never gets invited to anything. she was talking about not knowing that Lindsay was being baptized, which is funny because i was the only one invited to that in the first place.. she called to invite me, my aunt never called and told anyone.&nbsp; that lady makes me crazy.. so anyway! Phil and i just hung out watching wrestling and Daddy Day Care. some how my stuffed animals ended up all over the floor in my room.. i don't remember why that happened but it did..   as a side note the mom comments were left at:: he seems like a really happy person which is more then i can say about...(take your pick of any of my ex's cuz i'm sure she said it lol)... ; and said that we should have him over again when it's just the 6 of us so she can talk to him and interrogate him..&nbsp;&nbsp;i'm excited about what little she did have to say tho because normally it's&nbsp;things like "he's gay" or "he looks like a lephrachaun" haha i love my mom.. and she didn't say a thing about the peircings which suprised me.

      ok so apparently if i'm gonna talk about someone i need to learn how to spell *cough Chris Elliott cough*.. i hope everyone is happy now.  today was pretty slow.. i cleaned.. but i went out and that made it all better. as of&nbsp;yesterday Phil and i have been dating for one month. yay. i know i'm excited considering it's hard for me to find someone who's willing to spend that much time with me lol. and he's mostly sane.. we went out for chinese and then went to see a movie (Godsend). and for those of you who have little faith in me.. i did watch it, all of it!&nbsp;it was ok, it was supposed to be scary but it wasn't. i'm not sure the guy next to us heard any of the movie.. maybe i'm just easily distracted but his rubbing his wind pants got pretty annoying..  there's a black cat in my kitchen looking at me.. when did we get a black cat?

      i had a small discussion with my mom about why half naked women are always in commercials.. whether it's for underwear or weed whackers.. they are always in skimpy little two peices. so i thought about some of the innocent commercials (what little we have) and figured they weren't as innocent as we thought.. when you think about them in the way they were meant to be heard.    Glade Plug Ins--&nbsp;Plug it in plug it in  Reeses-- There's no wrong way to eat a reeses  Campbells-- Mmm... Mmm...&nbsp;Good  Energizer Batteries-- it keeps going and going and going and...  Reasors-- The right stuff.. the right price..  Nike-- Just do it  Almond Joy-- Sometimes you feel like a nut  Applebee's-- Eatin' good in the neighborhood   Mountain Dew-- Do the Dude   Dell-- Easy as dell  Dr. Pepper-- Nothing's better  Toyota-- Get the feeling  Herbal Essence Hair Dye-- Join the steaking party ~~Herbal Essence products in general are dirty.. (ooh ahh omg ooohh..)  Auto Zone-- Get in the zone  QuickTrip-- Every trip guaranteed  Napa Auto Parts-- We got the good stuff  KFC-- I eat what tastes good -- I'm on the Dale Jr diet  ok i'm bored now... i kinda stretched some of those.. but i can make anything sound dirty.. it's a talent..

      so i didn't post last night.. i feel so incomplete...&nbsp; so teri.. bored much? lol i don't think i got a letter. hmm maybe i should call Nia? Ashley Senior said i should. anyway. i knew the dinner was on the 30th i just don't have a time it starts.. and when you call it a "wild pig festival" you make us sound so redneckish.. haha! Hopefully the Rays with be there and make it complete.  i went to the zoo yesterday. that as a lot of work.. but i know the zoo is something i can do next time cuz they loved it. and then today i got the day off which would have been ok ya know.. if he paid me! it's almost 6 and i still haven't heard from him and i dont exactly want to call and be like where's my money ya know? my goats are suffering more then i am tho cuz they haven't been fed yet and i'm out of feed.   Lindsay and i went to see Raising Helen today, it was cute. it made me almost cry lol. after that we went to the mall. i think i embarrassed Lindsay lol.. as we were walking back to my car some comment was made about the guys walking&nbsp;into the mall cuz they were&nbsp;looking at us so i yelled out after we walked by "oo the guy in the yellow hat was hott don't you think?!?!" and she was like OMG ASHLEY. oh well.. lol that's what happens when ppl look at me and i have someone with me who gets embarrassed easily..   nothing else to talk about.. Lindsay and John are lighting things on fire.. i should probably stop them but i'm not lol.

      It's so funny Teri&nbsp;should mention Redneck Ray lol. i saw Lil Redneck Ray (bradray)&nbsp;today. he was on the side of highway 75 tieing down some lawn mowers in the back of a pick up.. anyway.. so Teri.. you're moving? where? out of our school district&nbsp;we all&nbsp;hope.. lol jk. we need to hook up some time maybe you wont be busy shopping.. lol. oh i got a call from John Kyle about a dinner at the end of the month.. only he didn't tell me what time it starts. if ya know what time and if you're going, let me know. i don't wanna be the only one there.. but i was planning on dragging Phil with me.. he just doesn't know it yet..   anyway.&nbsp; today was ok. Becky and Andrew babysat with me. we sold lemonade.. it sucked. ok so i'm definetly fed up with the whiney thing the older one has going on.. i'm gonna shake her next time.. not really but it sounds like a good idea. anywho..   Phil and i went to the mall tonight. he was like a little kid at christmas when i told that the new ATHF&nbsp;dvd came out today.. so cute haha.. i get to borrow it.. since you didn't even know it was out yet.. it's only fair.. besides&nbsp;i'll make it worth it ;-) haha. a discussion about me and&nbsp;pregnancy came up like 3 times tonight.. that was odd.. anyway! we had fun.

      OK! so i went back to work today for the first time in 3 weeks.. the early thing sucks. i didn't know the sun came up befor noon... anyway. the girls were excited to see me, their dad was acting weird but maybe he's just weird and i didn't pick up on it until today. we went to purple glaze and then had a picnic at Florence Park (which is on Gary and 21st not Florence and 21st.. crazy&nbsp;ppl messin' with my head..). really we just fed the squirrels.. foamy made me do it. we went back to the house and played and then i was ignored for a good hour. apparently that was supposed to be my punishment for making them turn the tv off.. oh well. then i got to park on highway 75 for 20 mins while god knows what was going on around the 41st st and union exit. an accident i'm assuming but i never did hear anything on the radio for it.  &nbsp; alright so enough about that mindless stuff.. i colored my hair tonight. and guess what! i don't look like an osu mascot! hopefully it'll keep the red tint and not turn orange.. haha. anyway. it still looks very brown to me but everyone else in my house says it looks different.. you'll have to judge for yourself i suppose.

      today was exciting. i got a call around 2am from brandon. he was crying so being the retarded person that i am i asked what was wrong and he told me he got his f*** buddy pregnant. and he doesn't know how he's going to explain it to his girl friend. being the overly concerned friend that i am i was like "dude your life just turned into an usher song..." he got all pissy and said that wasn't funny so my brain then went to his other fav singer Kenny Chesney i was like "ok how about there goes my&nbsp;life..." lol he found that one even less funny then the usher comment. OH WELL. he'll get over it eventually. part of me thinks he's making it up considering the names he's chosen for this particular story... you all know my name is Ashley (i hope..), his girl friend's name is Ashlee, and his "friend's" name is Ashlei... anyone else seeing a pattern??  &nbsp; i spent a good 2 hours at walmart today with my parents. not as much fun as i had with phil but this time we had a list so it was ok.. lol. and i didn't have to sack anything and i didn't squish the bread.. i did however hit some guys cart with mine. i heard someone call it a buggy.. who calls it a buggy? anyone? i think that's weird.. you're weird.. moving on. i met phil at fun house after my walmart adventure around 3 and we went to his apartment and hung out until for awhile. we watched Joe Dirt and hung out with Heather. then we lost his keys. i'm curious as to where he found them.. and whether or not he found his glasses. and it's good to know he's scared of my mom, it's cute really. hehe. but it's a good idea he didn't come in.. because apparently i told my mom i was just going to fun house for an hour and then i had to make up what we did for 5 hours.. lol. i forgot i told her that.. oh well. i've talked to her about your eating habit mostly because i don't think it's a good idea but that's just me, and i was glad you ate that biscuit.. lol and you better eat tomorrow, or.. else.. a bug will bite you on the neck.. a lot.. while you're sleeping.. and.. you wont like it!&nbsp;(no one&nbsp;knows what i'm talking about.. so funny..) anyway.. so when i told her i wasn't hungry she told me if i didn't eat i'm not allowed to hang out with you anymore lol. umm i think i'm done babbling about that!  &nbsp; as a side note.. the agreement with my parents was i could dye my hair after i got my senior pics done.. black is still a big no no but oh well (i even tried dark brown and she said no..) so i got a strawberry blonde color. since it's not red i'm hoping it wont turn orange this time.. i think we're gonna do it tomorrow night.

      i just watched Freddy VS Jason... that had to have been the worst movie i have ever seen. (well.. Kill Bill Vol 1 still wins the number one spot in my personal opinion..)&nbsp;for those of you who haven't seen these awesomely evil monsters battle it out let me set up the first post murder scene..&nbsp;4 teenagers (3 girls and a guy) are screaming and yelling "help us" in the front yard and street and the first car that comes up is a police car (how convenient) anyway.. seeing the freaked out girls in the street one of which is in nothing but a towel and covered in blood he rolls the window down and says "do you girls need some assistance?"... that screams CHANGE THE CHANNEL&nbsp; but no.. i watched it anyway.. before anyone died i told john my guess as to the order of who would die and who would live.. it was too easy..  &nbsp; it definetely should have appealed to the male audience.. boobs, sex, and gore. unless he's an intellectual and he's looking for a more stimulating movie then this... or gay... i feel that i may be offending anyone who enjoyed this movie and for that i'm sorry. feel free to leave any angry comments you may have. i will then feel free to review them and delete them lol.  &nbsp; sometimes the man puts his who who dilly in a woman's cha cha...&nbsp;South Park is more awesome then Freddy VS Jason... at least it's educational.

      NOT! only 17 yr old girls named Ashley.. the rest of you suck! haha jk.. todays theme seems to be age.&nbsp; i'll just go see something rated R tonight and make myself feel better lol.  &nbsp;  Amy-- no one is naked.. just shirtless lol.  &nbsp;  speaking of shirts, i saw&nbsp;some funny ones&nbsp;today:   sex is like snow. you never know how much you'll get or how long it will last  forget the bull - ride the cowboy  i refuse to&nbsp;play well with others before noon    really i just wanted to see how the quote thingies work haha. i'm such a dork.. alright so yesterday was fun. i really didn't do much of anything.. big suprise huh? lol. i laid around the house all day. Andrew went to Nick's, John and dad went to play poker, and mom went to a party with some girl friends (and had a mudslide with out me!) so&nbsp;i&nbsp;went over to Phil's and we hung out till 8:30 or so and then we went grocery shopping. which was fun. for some reason doing that kinda stuff with someone who isn't related to you just makes it more fun. maybe i'm just weird. that could be it.. anyway. after that we went back to his apartment and watched south park. and then i went home and i was on time for the first time since i started dating him and no one was even here...&nbsp;   as for today.. my parents&nbsp;and &nbsp;Sheila went with me to get my senior pics done. the photographer noted my mad skills when it came to posing so my mom brought up the baby pagent thing.. i was like 5 when we stopped that lol. oh well. i really hope they come out ok! i know i'm&nbsp;cute but the whole fake smiling thing can make anyone look goofy.. (i'm not conceited i'm confident, besides i'm not the only one who thinks that! hehe).&nbsp; after that we went to cici's. i love their pasta and dessert pizzas.. lol. i decided i really wanna try ddr but i don't want to look like a total retard and i just have this feeling i'd be awful at it! lol.. that was random..

      so today was cool. around 1 i went over to sheila's and then we went shopping. i bought some cute tops and a new skirt for my senior pics that i FINALLY made an appointment for! it's on sat. morning. anyway sheila and i finally finished around 6 and we went to see Mean Girls. it was soo funny. sad to say it was mostly true. girls are horrible creatures and overly emotional and just awful lol. i love being me tho! i'm allowed to be a bitch... but then you have to take a look at the other half of our population.. the boy.. guys are so simple. if they are mad they just confront the other person.. after a couple of grunts and a punch or 2 everyone is friends again. so how is it that we are so different when it comes to this kinda stuff? guys dont really start rumors in order to ruin each others lives. they tell the truth lol. like that rumor about Eddie hanging a kitten. i asked him about it one day and he said "yeah that.. it was my neighbors cat and it was an accident.."  &nbsp;  moving on. after the movie sheila and i sat in the drive thru line at mcdonalds for like 10 mins.. and then we went over to Phil's.. and woke him up.. lol. but it's ok he likes it. just like how he likes it when i snap his rubber bands on his wrist.. he just doesn't know he likes it..

      i didn't mean you were boring Sheila.. i just meant the day as a whole was bad lol. and it said you coming over was the high light of the day thus far. so ha! what now..  so last night i went over to Phil's to hang out. yeah so guess who was there too.. you'll never guess.. Chris Elliot.. isn't that crazy? and apparently he doesn't like me too much lol. oh well i honestly don't remember ever being mean to him except teasing him about Emy.. speaking of Emy what ever happened to her? she just kinda stopped hanging out with us one day.. she ditched us for that ugly chick.. what's her name? i don't know.. is she still dating that Elijah Wood lookin' kid? i don't know his name either.. anywho! Phil and i went to see Sheila last night. that just ended with eye shadow lines down my arm and adidas adrenaline on my hand and a coupon for.. something.

      yeah so lets try this again.. i froze it the last time..  today has been boring. Sheila came over and hung out for awhile that was the highlight of the day so far. we went to sonic for lunch but that was to bribe my brothers to keep quiet. the thing they are black mailing me with.. i'll post later lol. after she left i watched jurasic park which is sad because i've seen it like 20x and for some reason it never really gets old.. it wasn't the best movie ever made and it's not even close to being my fav but i don't mind watching it when there's nothing to do. i played poker most of the day. which was fun cuz i suck lol. but that's ok... anywho.. i'll be back later to babble some more.

      soo today was pretty uneventful. i went to morris to get my dog. she's been awesome since she's been back. Sheila came over and fed my goats while i was gone.. silly girl..   i went over and hung out with Phil. first i had to get through the random ppl drinking on the porch with a half empty (or is it half full?) bottle of southern comfort. i only knew Heather and Jessica.. the 3 guys i have no clue who they were.. oh well.. and i met the nephew of the guy who lives down stairs. he was cool. eventually everyone left and Phil and i hung out until i had to go home which sucked cuz i don't like leaving.. lol.   anywho.. that was my whole day.. kinda sad when i see how short it was.. oh well.. i had fun and that's all that matters really.

      Since friday i have done nothing but talk to my brothers and parents using lines from movies or cartoons (for example: ATHF, Finding Nemo..) it was fun but it kinda makes me wonder what we were smoking..  we went to Hershey Park on friday. it was sooo much fun! bells will never satisfy me again lol. i'm such a chicken but i love the adrenaline rush of being scared. i hate going upside down more then anything and of course ALL of them went upside down! one of them called The Sidewinder, not only went upside down forwards.. it stopped and went backwards.. i was freaking out cuz i couldn't see where we were going so i pulled the the thing keeping me from falling to my death.. the plastic shoulder restraint.. so tight that i couldn't move and when we got stopped it wouldn't go down any farther for me to release it and the guys operating the ride were like "oh you wanna go again? sure we'll just leave you there" and my brother and uncle said bye and started to walk off, and of course the ride was fun and i loved it but i certainly didn't want to go twice in a row.. so after they checked all the seats and came back to me they were like "are you sure you want out?" the one guy told me i should come back later and get stuck again if i wanted and i wasn't sure what he meant so i just smiled and said it would be fun.. i didn't go back.. lol.. anyway it was interesting. what else happened? nothing.. it was just a lot of fun, my uncle hank is like a big kid. oh! and he let me drink lol. and yes he's the uncle that's a cop lol. i didn't get to have a lot it was just a little of my moms mudslide.. of course she pulled that "you're not going to like it" crap and i downed half of it before she yelled at me to give it back.   i'm so glad i'm back home. i love my family. i love spending time with them, especially john now that he's a teenager and we're kinda going through the same things and we have a lot in common recently. but occasionally you need to get away and sharing a hotel room or being stuck in a minivan for 9 hours makes getting away very very difficult!

      i love traveling... yay...  11 comments on that last one.. i was so excited i was like OMG ppl miss me but noo they were all from Sheila.. still not sure how that happened lol.  anyway i was having a bad day when i posted that last one! it's been much better recently. we went to canada to see the falls from that side it was interesting.. kinda.. sure. it was wet every where, i'm soo tired of being fully clothed and wet it sucks. plenty of boys haha. apparently my appearence bothered some and i had one little old lady look me up and down and give me a look like i was a tramp. so funny. i found my mounty! haha he was a little plastic but that's ok. i'll post pics once i get them developed.   we went to the beach yesterday. it was fun. but since the water was warm the fishies decided to have a little fun.. and there were like sperm lookin' things in the water and we over heard somebody say it was jellyfish eggs.. it was soo nasty. i spent 20 mins in the shower trying to get them out and another 20 combing out my hair. we stayed in Bayville, NJ with my great aunt and uncle. i went to vinnie's new resturaunt. he had a baseball shop awhile back, then it became a deli, then he sold that. and then they moved and he opened a ice cream shop, that became a deli in the winter, and now it's a resturaunt. he took that over for a friend of his who got sick.   we went to the boardwalk today. more boys! haha. i got a henna tattoo, it looks pretty cool i need to take a pic of it before it fades.. after that we went to somerville, nj which is where i am right now. we're staying with my aunt and uncle.   being back east brings back so many memories. like daddy going to dunkin doughnuts on sunday mornings and getting john and me a box of doughnut holes.. we would throw them at each other trying to make it in the others mouth. and usually it just ended up with ys covered in powered sugar but it was fun. and then there was the boys and me begging my parents to let us go to friendly's at the mall and getting ice cream. ahh the good ole days.

      so i'm in buffalo, ny. and this trip has been less the perfect but that's ok. and this lady keeps bugging us about the firesworks display that was cancelled yesterday.. HELLO i'm in a hotel i'm not from around here...  friday we drove 9 hours to Cleveland Ohio. and it rained the entire time i was awake.. i slept maybe 2 hours. we stayed in Terra Haute that night.. and we left around 5 or 6 to go to Ohio. once we got to Cleveland my dad and i went to the rock and roll hall of fame. it was really cool. after listening to nothing but country for the past 2 days i was excited to hear something other then songs about a pick ups and beer! my dad and i found a comp to listen to the artists that have been inducted and so we stood there (with our headphones) singing and dancing along with The Beatles, Aerosmith, Billy Joel.. ya know.. the good ones! haha it was fun.   sunday, yesterday, we went to niagara falls. you guys know i'm not a very racists person. i don't care if someone is black, white, yellow, green, blue, whatever.. but omg i have never seen so many middle eastern ppl in my life. and they were the rudest ppl i have ever met. i was being nice and ignored it but after the 10th full grown man knocked Andrew over i got a little pissed off. we had to stand up on the trolly back to our parking lot and when it finally stopped (we had been riding for 30 mins standing) a lady next to us jumps up in between my mom and andrew and about knocked him over so my mom gently slid the lady back in her seat it was soooo funny. but anyway. we went to hard rock for dinner and we got free onion rings.. cuz i'm cute! not really.. he forgot about them.   today we went to see Ken and Darren. lots of hugs and kisses hehe! i love those guys. Maria is getting sooo big. and they invited me to stay with them for a couple weeks next summer! i will definetly take them up on that!!   alright well i don't really have anything else to talk about! i probably wont be back on here for awhile.. possibly not till sunday.

      good job.. now.. say it faster.. good job my little minions..  so this will be my last post for a couple of days... i know every one is sad...  we went bowling tonight. for once i was on time. it was the rest of the group that was late. unfortunately some ppl didn't bother to show up at all.. oh well that's your loss because we had a blast! i came in 4th to last the first 2 games and then i think 3rd in the last one. (i actually beat Phil! hehe) Angel and Kevin were there with Randall and Melinda. Sheila and my brothers were there too. my favorite part would be when John locked my keys in the car.. or the perverted jokes about greasy balls.. or when Phil humped Angel's ball.. or David hahahaha.. the list goes on. after that we went to taco bell in jenks where surprisingly enough they messed up the order yay jenks. after that i went home and went to bed like a good little girl! and while i was sleeping i had the most interesting dream...  in my dream i snuck out and went to Phil's apartment where we hung out watching cartoons for awhile. we soon got bored with the animated goodness and focused on some real life issues.. like.. umm.. not so animated goodness.. lol. i suppose i'll let you fill in the rest i wouldn't want my dream to embarrass the other person involved.. just know that it was well worth the trouble i could have been in.. had this been real life.. haha.. i wonder what he dreamed about..

      it's that time again! homecoming. yay. i'm in kansas for the carnival that is held in this tiny little town every year. i'm really sad that we aren't staying for the street party sunday night! but that's ok, you only win at the raffle if you are rich or italian. besides Andrew and Phil have a date that night...  i kinda wonder if i'll run into Nasty Nate while i'm here.. you guys remember him right? the 30 yr old man who claimed to be 23 at Gigi's apartment... in my defense he didn't look that old lol... he grew up in Frontnac (a little town right outside the little town where i am) and his parents still live there and he comes up here every now and then. how funny would that be? oh and y'all know i can't wait to see Timmy, wonder how many teeth he has left? it's a good thing i left Sadie at home... he would be more interested in her.  i grossed myself out with that one.. haha..

      Phil was right, he does let me babble without interrupting me but it usually ends with a "you're dumb" but that's why i love him lol... did i spell my title right? haha  anyway! in my last post i talked about why i like my blog and now here's why i dont like it... i shouldn't talk about things that no one needs to know about... but i do it anyway so here it goes...  the last time i talked about this i was harrased on AIM by one of the parties involved, maybe this time it will go over a little better... i feel really selfish about what happened last week. the post that night talked about messing with ppls emotions on really personal levels, maybe you remember maybe not... anyway i was so hurt about it and not knowing for sure who it was that was telling the truth. i'm so tired of being hurt and cheated on and lied to that the littlest thing freaks me out. i didn't really stop to see how it affected the other person involved in this little web of lies. and i feel awful that maybe i didn't pay enough attention to those feelings. even tho i know it's not my fault i can't help but think that it is. and i just wish there was something i could do to fix it. sometimes i think i should have kept it all to myself, like i was told to.. but that would have made me miserable and ruined the relationship i have with the other person. but by saving the relationship between this other person and myself i destroyed a relationship between this person and another.. what would you have done?

      So it finally happened.. my computer has gone completely insane..  it's sad that i dont have anything to talk about other then i have 2 more days left to babysit and i'm thanking God for that. anyway a normal person wouldn't have even bothered to post today.. but since when am i normal? i decided if i didn't have this i would probably go insane, this allows me to babble with out interruption.. yay..  anyone read The Da Vinci Code? i read like the first 3 chapters or so. and i definetly need to add that to my bookshelf. so far it seems really cool.  ~~Teri-- i dont have to go to my site to set up, i talked to Connie about all that stuff the other day. i just have to go to the classes. i was talking about enrollment on the 10th you drk.

      ~~for those of you that it matters to (the ones i was supposed to enroll with lol)--- i got my schedule for work, and i have a class 11-4 on the 10th so i wont be able to do breakfast before.~~ ~~Teri-- are we hookin' up that morning?? if so, we are need to make random lines again!! that was sooo funny.. i'll bring a table if i have to.. ~~  so those freakin' kids are making me insane... they never hear the word no and think " i have no money" means maybe i'll buy something else for you just not that. now i feel bad bugging my mom when she gave me that excuse. we got to go to the mall tho so it's ok, we spent almost 2 hours in Limited Too. that was fun... then i got followed around by a very butch security gaurd. which was odd.. maybe she thought i was hott? i dunno... anyway i talked to the guy in sun coast for awhile mainly because i think Phil and i were rude to him the other night maybe we weren't and i just think we were... who knows... anyway.. i was just being polite. that dvd collection of friday the 13th is $130. that's insane.  anyway, now i get to rant about Connie!! she told me i'm in charge of art (no complaints from me, Ashley and i hid back there all the time anyway), and in her words i "get to be Julie all year since she wont be with us again". maybe it's just me that finds that "you be so and so" thing funny... you'd have to know Connie...

      this is my 69th post yay so today was fun!! you know anytime Teri and i get together something bad happens to those around us...  Teri and i went to the mall to meet Tiffany and she wasn't too happy to see us.. cuz we were late and she left. Teri and i wandered around for awhile. they dont have my baby stewie bag at hot topic anymore!! i was sooo gonna buy it today.. Damn you all.. i was so sad... i'm still sad... anyway... we went to Dillards and Foley's and found a whole table of stuff.. we weren't sure if it was decoration or not.. but in Teri's words "there's no price tag!" so in her purse it went lol... which reminds me i need to talk to Phil about what he wants for his bday... i just like to shop lol.  after that we headed over to Cheddars. i got my mudslide finally so i was happy lol. omg we ate so much.. lol..  we headed over to Fun House.. we asked the guy for one of those token coupons and he said something about a different coupon and i had no idea what he was talking about i've never had to give them one before, but the last time i was with Phil so just joking around i was like "Aww if Phil were here you'd let me" and he laughed and so i went over to the token machine Teri on the other hand kept pestering the guy (and every other guy that she came across whether he worked there or not...) and he got a little pissed off lol.. so i finally dragged her away. anyway! our first stop was DDR... OMG that was hilarious.. lol.. we couldn't figure out how to get it on easy or something slow.. so we just picked one.. it was awful lol.. all these ppl were watchign and laughing at us.. including the guys at the counter... it was great.. there are some new games that weren't there last time, Rythem Nation and some other game over by the PacMan game. so the guy Teri pissed off came up behind us and was like "ya know your tokens will go a lot farther if you play games you know how to play.. i saw you play DDR and Rythem Nation and..no.." and then he walked off lol.. we both turned soooo red and just laughed.. i felt so stupid. what else is new? lol..

Since i'm still making it.. "Ashley Junior: The Prequal to something amazingly awesome"  - Do you ever pretend to be someone else just to look cool?  No, i'm just naturally awesome  - Are you a loner?  No  - If you were another person, would you be friends with you?  Yes, and i would even date me, even if that meant being a lesbian, but the real me isn't a lesbian so that would be very sad to the me that's not really me..  - Have you got a journal?   Yes, just ask Phil..  - Are you confident?  Sometimes    HAVE YOU EVER...  - Gone skinny dipping?  No but i want to  - Played strip poker?  Yes  - Gotten beaten up?   No  - Beaten someone up?

Yes  - Do you remember your first love?   Clint McGehee  - What do you find romantic?   Star gazing.. it's soo sweet to cuddle and look up at the stars  - What would you do if you were walking down the street and saw some hot guy/girl standing on the sidewalk?  Since i dont make a habit of doing anything alone.. i would smack their ass and tell them the person i was with did it, regardless of sex and age.  - What do you dislike most?   People who dont like me.. i dont listen to them..    WHO WAS THE LAST PERSON...  - You wanted to kill?   Chris   - That you laughed at?   John  - That laughed at you?   My Mommy  - To ask you out?   Phil :-)  - To make you cry?  Chris  - To brighten up your day?  Phil  - That you thought about?  since he was the last answer.. Phil  - You talked to on the phone?   My Mema  - You saw?  Andrew  - You turned down?   Jon Henley
