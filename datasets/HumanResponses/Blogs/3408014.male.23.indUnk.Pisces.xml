      I just heard about the decision of the craziest governor in the world - Ahmed Sani of Zamfara State, Nigeria to demolish all churches.  Indeed this man is an anti-Christ. He must be dealt with as one.  I am amazed at the fact that this man has been allowed to continue in office and continue to perpetuate these undemocratic, demonic and unconstitutional acts. The press are not pounding on this man and the president and all the law makers have allowed him to continue.   This is a shame to democracy and the Nigerian press.   It is a big shame to all those who claim to promote democracy in Nigeria.  How can this be allowed to continue.   God help us.

      Men, I did not know that elections here can be so nasty. I find it very interesting that these 2 grown men will attack each other - especially Bush. I never hear am say wetin im go do. Na only talk about how im opponent - Kerry never do anything. Dem suppose be ashamed.  I was just thinking last week about how they always celebrate achievements. I think that is a main difference between us Naija and these Oyinbo. If a Naija man do anything remarkable, everybody go dey jealous am. Na talk about how na luck people go dey talk. Bu did Oyinbo people, dem no go stop celebrating that person even horse sef.  Imagine how dem dey celebrate Smarty Jones and now Armstrong.  I gast to go.  Enjoy
