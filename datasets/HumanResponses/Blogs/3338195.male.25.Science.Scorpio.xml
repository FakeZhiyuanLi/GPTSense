      Hair is a funny thing. Or should I say, my hair is funny. See, I shaved my head a few weeks ago (long story) and now I'm growing it back. At least, I'm trying to grow it back. See, I have Chinese genes, and standard Chinese hair. That means my hair is thin, straight and the roots are spread out.   That means when my hair is short, I can't do anything with it. In fact, I'm at the complete submission of whatever my hair wants to do. Unfortunately, it only ever wants to do one thing when it's short: stick straight up.   So I'm dealing with what my hair is: a Chinese Afro. A Chafro? A Chifro? It sticks straight out on the sides and back, and straight up on top. Hair glue products are futile since my hair is so thin - I can get a few to stick together, but that just makes my hair look like a spikey Chafro. Spikey is too generous; it looks more like a black Chiapet.   So until I hit that magical 1.5 inches up top, I will suffer in silence with my Chafro.

      Subtle Devices is a place for me to write - simple as that. I'll cover anything that interests me -  Short essays or observations on everything I come across. I used to write for a living and I miss it. Now, I only write dry half-english, third-person, wishy-washy, template-driven lab reports. No creativity or humor allowed (lawyers have no appreciation for sarcasm).   Subtle Devices is for me, because when I write I am infinitely amusing to myself. This site isn't completely about me, nor is it a list of what I had for lunch, what I did at the gym, or that I am going to sleep now. No one cares about what brand of socks I wear and if you do, you need to get out more.   I will try to be funny when I can. Reading humor is great, but it is difficult and time consuming to write. I will delve into serious subjects, but I don't take anything I write seriously. I will not have a rambling stream of conciousness...filled...with...elipsees...  I will use proper HTML. I will never say "Click Here". I willl use proper grammar (knowledge permitting). I will use as few inside jokes as possible (unless it's an inside joke with myself). I will use a lot of parentheticals (bad habit, but I think this way).   So as soon as the DNS propagates, I will write!

      I did a good thing. I registered for the  urlLink National Bone Marrow Donor Program . If there's a sick person out there that can use my bone marrow, they'll contact me. It's a great program. Think of it this way - a few days of discomfort for you to save someone's life. Just think about that for a second. Why would you not want to do it?

      This is what you get when you deal with dead people a lot: Now that Regan's body has been paraded around the country, the only thing I can think of is, what kind of coffin is he in? It needs to be some sort of special coffin to keep him from decomposing, right? What do they use? Is it vacuum sealed? Refrigerated? He can't be embalmed already, can he? Maybe we'll never know.
