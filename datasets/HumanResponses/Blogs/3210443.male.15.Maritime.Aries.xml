      I'v decided not to start the Stuff page up in full force until I move this site to a real domain.  What I mean by this is that I'm not gonna spend time on this or have anyone else update this blog until I move it to a real web domain, along the lines of www.intellectual-void.com, but I don't have the benjamins right now to do that.  But it will happen soon, prbly after the first coming of the urban cowboy...

      That's right!  A new post!  Nothing special yet though, just like to mention that I'm gonna change the entire site to look like this template and the one I have as the main blog.  What about the billboard?  That may soon be coming down...in exchange for... A Webcam.  Webcam?!  No no, nudey shows are out.  This is going to be a [the crowd looks confused] "perspective webcam."  What the fuck does that mean?  It means that it's not going to be of people, but will be of other shit like out side my window or another window, of the kitchen, of the tv, of me occasionaly.  This way you can pretend your in my house al the time!  What fun!  But honestly its gonna kick ass coz' I'm going to spin it up with some ingenious genious like never heard of.  Through it out or not, its goin good.  BIG NEWS:  THE TRUE MEANING AND PURPOSE OF THE STUFF BLOG!  THIS WILL BECOME A TEAM BLOG!  ?  That means that I will not be the only person who can post on it.  I'll allow certain people to post on it, and they can invite others, and soon there will be billions, maybe even millions!  A Monster!  A Monster!  Yep so keep out the eyes- this friday is the coming setup.  Nice.

      Today was alumni day at LaSalle, and I have to say that that school is making me more depressed each time I find out how much their preppifying it.  I mean, it was kinda preppie when we left, but the bootleg side of the school kept it in check.  When we left, you still had to duct-tape mic cords to the walls to make sure they reached the mixer, considering before we had to put a mic up to a fuckin boombox for music.  Stage crew was actually fun, and there was actually some level of work involved.  I remember when I spent half the day downstairs with Mr. Van, when to Mrs. Crushshons knowledge I was helping some kindergarten parents setup for some assembly.  You could actually get away with shit like that.  Now their redoing the ENTIRE sound system, and revamped the gym.  And plus, their redoing the playground!  They changed it once, why change it again?  If they do anything other then redo the blacktop, then hells gonna break loose.  And an ELEVATOR?!  No wonder obesity is an epidemic in the U.S.!  And the next freshman class knows more people from private schools then they do from their own!  WHAT IS OUR WORLD COMING TO?!  When will people actual realize that change is good, but once you start making meaningless and un-needed changes, shit starts to break down.  Oh fuck, arthritis.  Did you know all dogs are part of the same species?  No matter what breed they are, there still the same species.  And did you know that by definition, Mules are not living things?!  Who makes these rules anyway...  THIS BRINGS US TO OUR SEGMENT: IF NIKESH COULD REWRIGHT ALL THE STUPID RULES AND LAWS THAT RUN OUR SOCIETY, WHAT WOULD HE REPLACE THEM WITH?  Stay tuned cause this shits gonna get good.

      So I'm walking home from school today and guess who I see: Steve Ivcich.  Except it wasn't Steve Ivcich.  It was Steve Ivcich, just 15 years younger.  And he wasn't named Steve Ivcich.  This is yet again another example of me seeing someone who I know except just at a different age.  For example, last summer I did my community service hours at Ronald McDonald House, which is this place by Children's Memorial Hospital that gives free room and board to people who don't live in the area but don't know when they can return home because their kid has a disease, is badly injured, etc.  So the grounds kept at the Ronald McDonald house is named some name I can't remember, but I know his name wasn't Zandy.  Except the weird thing is that this guy looked EXACTLY like Zandy, except 30 years older.  Same voice, same face, same sense of humor, the whole 9 yards (speaking of 9 yards, I remember this conversation I had a while back about the origin of that phrase and is has something to do with escaping from prisons.)  So It's the present day, and yet their are two identical version of the same person(s), except they are of different ages.  And have different names.  Another example: So I have to go to get a hair cut cause my dad turns into a Fundamentalist when my hair gets to long so I had no choice but to cut it.  So I'm off to the Hair Cuttery, the one on Wells and Eugenie to be exact, and I go inside and put my name down and take a seat.  So I wait around 15 or so minutes and then this lady tells me to come back.  Now this ain't any ordinary lady, this is the one and only Chuck.  Yes, the Chuck from Narsty, the Chuck that's George's friend, the one we all only kinda know and yet still love.  Except once again, it isn't really Chuck.  It's Chuck all right, but 10 years older.  And she ain't named Chuck.  But other then those two recurring factors, they are one in the same.  They listen to the same frickin' music, and not only that, she even told me about how she went to the last Bad Brains concert, and how it sucked cause they played only their most famous shit and then a bunch of their Reggae/Rock/Jazz fusion stuff (Not that that has anything to do with Chuck herself, but it just shows that she has common sense.) If you haven't caught on yet, then let me put the bib on for ya (Red Lobster is overrated.) (like sushi.)  All of these examples and stories that I have just given you have one "thing" in common.  This one "thing" holds all the pieces of this mysterious puzzle together, and gives it its meaning.  This one "thing" has somehow been able to take all of these stories and make them possible; this one "thing" is the glue that holds the pizza pie to the plumber's ass. Until the moment this afternoon when I was walking home from school and I saw Steve Ivcich but I really hadn't, I had always wondered what the one special thing about this "thing" really was.  I had always known this "thing" to be this "thing", and yet I always knew that this "thing" had some other purpose, agenda, special thing about this "thing" that always seemed to make weird things happen involving this "thing" that no one could explain.  And then, after I passed the Steve Ivcich that wasn't Steve Ivcich, I realized what was the thing about this "thing." This "thing" had the ability to warp our own ideas about people, and reshape them to give us a new understanding of these people.  These people are the ones I spoke of.  They were once but people I knew, but I didn't really know em'.  Now I don't exactly feel like I know know em', but I don't feel like a stranger.  And yet I have also realized that this "thing" truly isn't someone different then ourselves.  This "thing" in fact holds no superpowers at all, No exotic/erotic voodoo magic, No complex personality that people can't understand, in fact, the only extraordinarily Amazing Thing about This "Thing" Is IT's BLINDing, CHAOS Causing, TUSUNAMI Trembling, ABSOLUTELY RAVISHING SEXINESS!  This "Thing" is none other then George Ivcich. p.s. By Sexiness I mean [crowd whisper's in Nikesh's ear]... Sexiness

      I am now making a call to you all: (call meaning plead) Please tell people about this blog! Why you ask?  What's in it for me? A: What if I told you I would pay you to write for this blog if I could get enough daily visitors, more then just the people we know directly. Sounds good right?  To good to be true? Just take a look at www.Gizmodo.com That sight is owned by a guy who just lives off the advertisements on his weblog.  That's it. Well you say, why would anyone want to read this blog?  It sucks now anyway, no good or interesting readable content anyway. Fair enough.  But how about this:  what's the one thing that always holds my plans and ideas back from being carried forward?  The answer my friends is money. So what if I got enough money from the ads to finance my projects, and then I wrote about them in the blog?  People would sure as hell read that.  And then I could start putting up movies and pictures and eventually the traffic on the site would be so great that not only could I finance bigger projects, I could also turn in an actual profit from the blog.  By the way, the blog by this time would have a real webpage, not this free one I'm on now.  And then the I would become WE, and then WE could have simultaneous projects going on and it would be fucking crazy!  Pay your way through college, give you something to put on your resum√©, something to right your thesis on.  And now I want to address one issue that I think separates me and those who believe in my ideas from those who immediately cast them off and say, "That aint gonna happen."  Just think about what we could do.  Don't think about how were gonna get there, just think about how kick ass it would be when everything is set up and flowin'.  Just let the ideas flow, and don't let reality hold you back, cause reality is just what society makes you think is realistic.  There are no boundaries when it comes to these Ideas.  Yes, Ideas is capitalized.  Just fucking forget about how "unrealistic" things are for once.  Let your imagination run wild in a field where everything you could possibly need to make your idea come true is at your fingertips.  "Realistic" is meaningless.  Welcome to my world.  Let your mind wonder and don't be afraid/ashamed/fell stupid to think about things that societydoesn'tt accept or you think other people will reject you for. That'ss the best part about thinking, cause no one can intrude on you or invade your privacy.  All your thoughts are personal and private, and most importantly, unrestricted.  This may sound like the same old bullshit they tell you in preschool except this actually has some value.  These ideas give you a new direction in life.  I can't tell you how many times I change my opinion on topics after thinking about them.  I'm like a supermodel going through Menopause.  Damn that's a good quote.  Niccolo Machiavelli once proposed, "The ends justifies the means."  No they don't, cause the means are always justified if the ends are productive and meaningful. Productive and meaningful you say?  How is a Rocket powered RadioFlyer productive or meaningful?!  Sentimental value.

      PHIL: Tell me what you want, and your in on the bet.  I know I'm gonna win, and you know I'm gonna lose, so I know you wanna cash in on this, cause so do I. Any other people who want to be in on this bet between me and George about my trick roping skills should post in the billboard or talk to me somehow.

      So I saw 'Troy' and I have to say that Brad Pitt's butt is NEVER shown, therefore it must be an action movie.  Next weekend (May 28-31) I prbly can't do much cause I have finals the week after.  After that though I'm out of la escuela and I am dedicating the majority of my time to becoming an urban cowboy.  I think we should start a dude ranch in someone's backyard... ANNOUNCEMENTS:  'Seed of Chucky': Chucky has sperm in his eye  If artificial diamonds ever become widely available, then hybrid steel-carbon lattice structured materials will rule the world  I need help with the h off the oxygen on the backwards limb  007 lives-Terentino best direct the next one  Ocean's mother fucin' 12!

      Irony of the week:  Phil "informed" me of that I was the biggest whiner, more then that of himself.  This came from the boy that through a ball that did not belong to his being into an unmarked alley and refused to get it, even though the person who actually owned the ball didn't do shit to him.  And then he refused to play football after and delayed my dad by approximately 5 minutes when it was my dad who offered to drive him home.  And then when he finally agreed to play football he changed his mind and went fucking Transformers on us and became the one and only classic whinny bitch.  OH, THE IRONY!  Any off the doo-da, I will officially not stand for any more racial slurs on my person UNTIL I find a better racial slur for Whites, Mexicans, and Jews.  Until then, I will not hold back from dropping anyone who does use them against me, unless I have tactically calculated that they in fact have the strategic edge and pure muscular capability to overpower me quickly and efficiently so that they may beat me before I can beat them.  Not that I won't laugh at them before I kick your ass, but be forewarned. I have l√© informaci√≥n on l√© summer:  EVERYONE BE WITNESS- I have made a bet with George.  The details of this bet follow:  George has bet me that I cannot learn how to trick rope and lasso by the end of this summer, which is defined as the first day of MY school year.  I begged to differ, and have told George that I will in fact learn how to trick rope and lasso by the end of this summer.  If I in fact DO learn how to trick rope and lasso by the end of this summer, then George will be my slave-for-a-day.  If George wins the bet, then he will get something from me in return, which as of now has yet to be decided.  I WILL PREVAIL, AND SHOW THOSE THAT ARE NOT BELIEVERS THAT I AM THE URBAN COWBOY, RANGER OF THE WILD WILD midWEST!

      Another Lovely day on the way to drivers ed, sitting in the back of a bus with 14 other people where only 8 can fit, and Rush Limbaugh blaring on the radio.  I have to say, that if it was any warmer, I would have been in hell.  Rush Limbaugh?  The devil.  God?  Forget him.  Jesus?  Dead.  Fahrenheit 9/11 kicked ass.  I wish it had focused more on the false motives that led to the war in Iraq, but hey, its all good.  Music update: I was listening to the Bundu Boys after Andrew left on Friday, and I got to thinking...The world would be a better place if Americans listen to world music.  American music is always about an image, a philosophy, a motive, a feeling.  But world music is not like that.  World music is about music.  I like songs with a political message in em, but still; I like to just sit back and not give a shit every once in a while.  People are way to serious about things in this world.  And no, world hunger and war are not what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about vanity and society: people are to self conscious and AFRAID that they'll fuck up in life.  Why do you think we have so much more homework as students now then our parents did 30-40 years ago.  They say we have to work harder, cause the world is more competitive now then it was before.  But that's because people don't sit back and say, "Hey! Hey....."  Today with live two lives: One in the present, and one in the future.  People are pressured into living in the future, by being forced to do hard work now, so that you'll do better in the future.  But what happens when that future gets here?  Then you need to talk about your 401k plan, how to invest for your retirement.  And what about when that future gets here, your retirement?  Then you think about your death, how your family is going to support itself, your will.  And then that future arrives.  What are you gonna plan after that?  Nothing.  To bad you realized on your death bed that instead of living in the future you could have spent your time in the present.  Cared for your family.  Had fun with your friends.  Loitered in the time you had, the time that never felt like it would run out.  Haven't people realized?  80 years is a long fucking time.  But what happens when you do live in the present only?  Well fucking look at me: 3 pills a day, a visit to the therapist once a week, a trip to the psychiatrist quarterly, and a piece of shit high school. And I wouldn't give that shit up for anything.  So what if you get hell for you decisions.  Live in the present.  Fuck the stiff.  Lets TANGO!

      IT"S HERE! The Stuff page is finally (almost) finished!!!  I still need to fix some things, but I really wanted to get it out there to see what you all thought of it.  The Stuff page is still not complete, but it's so close you shouldn't have that many problems.  It's basically a page dedicated to odd shit I find around the web, or odd stories I have, or oxy morons, and funny stuff or spit your guts out stuff or shit in a bowl stuff or lots of other stuff.  It's gonna get a hell of a lot better, once I announce the REAL reason that's gonna make it different from all other blogs you have read.  But I wont announce that till when its officially complete.  Until then, comment and tell me what you think I need to change before the final release, or just what you think of it.  In the final I'll have the spacing and alignment setup right, and link to post comments will be right on the main page.  I am going to update the music page soon to, so stay tuned.

      The Stuff page is coming along nicely and should be up and running within the next few days.  I have some very bad news.  On the 1st of July, I will be leaving for Michigain, where I will spend two weeks with my grandfather.  That is not bad news at all.  The bad part is that (be prepared): MY PARENTS ARE MAKING ME TAKE A CELL PHONE  [Choke - Barf] [the crowd breakes into a riot]  The worst part is that I can't use my mom's or my sister's, coz' they need it.  I hereby am kicking my plans for getting that kick ass Motorola phone off eBay into high gear so if, in the rare and catostrophic event I have to keep the phone, I can at least rip it apart and make it look presentable.   THE NO CELL PHONE CLUB STILL LIVES!

      It's another lovely day in the neighborhood with the 9/11 Commision and Investigative Panel, where dumb struck congressmen restate the obvious and make it look like new news!  Shall we take today's headline of the  Chicago Tribune :    Panel: No Iraq link to 9/11    DUH! How fucking stupid are these people!  How long have we already know this?!  MONTHS! YEARS! GOD DAMN DECADES!  Why does the American public need a 1.5" Headline to Realize that There was no connection between Iraq and 9/11!  I WANT TO SHIT MY PANTS!  I would like to take a moment now to predict the future.  What is going to happen in Iraq?  Hmm, that's a damn good question.  Let's take ANOTHER look at one of today's Headlines from the one and only  Chicago Tribune :    Sadr tells militia to stand down, says he will form political party    Just fucking GREAT!  The last thing that Iraq fucking needs is a god damn cleric pissing off the U.S. forces while also undermining their efforts by actually gaining popular support for a religious dictatorship! DO YOU SEE THE CONNECTION?!...  "Hello, this is Hitler speaking.  This is who?  Moqtada al who?  SÔøΩderr?  What did you call me?!  Are you a Jew?  Oh, you hate Jews?  How lovely!  You seek to reclaim the land the Jews have stolen from your people?  What a coincidence, I happen to want the exact same thing!  What's this, organized violence and holy war?  Oh this is turning me on, don't stop!  DON'T STOP!  What?!  The west is evil?  I smell an alliance... what did you say your name was?  Could you spell that out please?  Ok, hold on, lemme get a pen here... ok go.  M-O-Q-T-A-D-A  A-L  S-A-D-R... I'll try to remember that.  Oo, what's this?  Your a naughty boy?  Oh my, now this is getting somewhere..."  Yes Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls: Sadr is just like fucking Hitler!  Except the Jews already have a national state, control the region and have key alliances with the U.S., the other thing Sadr hates (that being western unethical values).  WHAT SHALL WE DO!  I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna go to Max B.'s house and pickup the stuff I left at his house from the weekend of the Art Fair.  And then I'm goin' to bed.  Have a good night, and drive safely.

      Yo this weekend was pretty damn nice minus the fact that the public school kids have finals which ment a select few were unable to do anything fun, and because of that were slightly agitated.

      I am contemplating whether to keep the Billboard, as it seems it does not get much use (which is logical considerng hardly anyone reads this...Xanga is for sissies.)  I am also going to do away with the Events page, and replace it with a Stuff page.  The Stuff page would have odds and ends, such as an animated flash music video for Tenacious D's "Fuck her Gently" among other things.  I am sorry to announce that I cannot post Daniel's song on the upcoming new music page because hes a bitch and won't give it to me.  The Skalpel song won't be up there just yet because the CD hasn't been released through any major providers in the U.S. yet.  Now that I think of it, I'm jsut gonna make the Stuff page right now.  UPDATE:  The Events page will be replaced by the Stuff page within the next few weeks, and will have kick ass stuff like "Banana Phone" and other crazy shit.

      I hope you all took the time to read my previous post on how formal clothing is going to destroy our society.  There will be more posts like it in the future, concerning other stupid laws, rules, etc. that I deem idiotic, pointless, destructive, or worthy of being referred to as "political propaganda."  HOWEVER, I will take a short break from that saga to turn my attention to my new quest:  My dissertation on Parasitic Worms in Humans   NEWS FLASH: I most likely will not be able to deck out in western cowboy, 1860s-esk garbs on the last day of Public school.  This is due to the cost factor (who would've guessed) and nothing else.  I even found a kick ass pair of batwing chaps and boots w/ spurs to wear, but I do not have the capital to acquire such goods.  However, this DOES NOT signal the demise of the Urban Cowboy, as I will eventually return TO KICK ALL YOUR ASSES!  GEORGE AND PHIL AND ALL THOSE IN ON OUR BET: YOUR FUCKIN' GOIN' DOWN DOPES!  DON'T QUESTION MY WRATH! THE URBAN COWBOY LIVES!

      I, SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE UNIVERSE AND ALL UNDERLINGS, NIKESH PATEL, HEREBY OPEN CASE FILE #38027-1: STUPID RULE OF SOCIETY #1: FORMAL CLOTHING  Formal clothing makes me sick.  Not only does it not serve any purpose whatsoever, it just makes everyone else's life chaotic and tense.  Not only has formal clothing changed our culture for the worse, I believe it could single handedly plunge our society back into the Dark Ages.  Now don't get me wrong, I still think penguin tuxes kick ass.  But I never said I hated clothing in general, I just hated "formal clothing."  A tux is just another article of clothing, which in theory should be worn just as much as any everyday t-shirt or pair of pants (minus the fact that they are next to impossible to clean and cost a fuck load of money.)  But affix the adjective "formal" in front of clothing, and all hell breaks loose.  I will start first by addressing why so many people in our society disagree with me, and then why they are in fact mentally extinct dopes.  A large percentage of our population, predominantly middle-class families with some sort of religious faith, attends functions that require formal dress and would not question it in a heartbeat.  They believe that at these functions, such as weddings, bar/bat mitzvahs, and benefits, formal clothing is appropriate and it is rude not to wear it.  They do not want to appear shabby, rugged, or god forbid informal.  However, these people have yet to realize one fatal flaw with their reasoning: what is defined as shabby, rugged, or informal?  And by whom?  The answer to this, my underlings, is not only simple, it is written on captain obvious him self‚Äôs t-shirt.  Shabby, rugged, and informal clothing is defined by a person‚Äôs perception of what society deems appropriate.  So if these people believe that society considers t-shirts, baggy pants and fishnet stockings shabby, rugged and informal, then whom did society get this idea from?  The answer to this, my feline friends, is human nature.  What?  Human nature?  What the fuck does the nature of humans have to do with why formal clothing is the bane of human civilization?  It has everything to do with it.  Humans are many things, but most importantly humans are greedy.  Oh wait you say, but I'm not greedy.  You may not think so, but greed is an essential part of human survival, and we would absolutely not be the dominant species on this planet if we weren't.  Oh hold it right there you accuse, I give my old clothes to homeless shelters and volunteer in my community.  Good for you I say, you should feel good about yourself.  But answer this question: Do you eat?  Of course you say, I eat because food is necessary for my survival.  And I say sure it is, but what about the child starving in the third world country with an economy that can barely support its corrupt government, doesn't that child need food to survive?  Or the homeless man outside your door and around the corner, sitting in his rain-soaked cardboard shelter: is food not necessary for his survival?  And you say yes, but it's unrealistic to give them my food, for I can't ship my dinner plate without the food spoiling, and plus it would cost too much anyway.  And the hobo down the street is high on crack anyway, so he doesn't want my food, and he smells anyway.  And I say to you, there, there is your greed.  And then you respond, but I give my $85, week-old cardigan to homeless shelters because they have gone out of fashion, and I give $5 to UNICEF on my yearly flight to Cancun, Mexico, where I spend 10 days at a beach resort, forgetting all my worries as I relax in a town where a town a few miles away 80% of the population lives below the poverty line.  And I say, there, there is your greed.  And you retort, well look at you!  Who ever said you were perfect, Mr. All high and mighty, steals from the poor and gives to the rich?!  And I say, no one.  No one ever said I was perfect, or any different than you.  No one said I was the Messiah, no one declared that I stood for all that is good and just.  And yet it is I that says, there, there is your greed.  And you scream to me, BUT WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME!  Do you want me to run out into the rain, and treat the hobo as I would myself, and give him my own food?!  Should I vacuum-seal my dinner plate, and ship it to a boy in Mozambique?  Should I take the costs out my own paycheck, and send my tax refunds to the homeless shelter half way across town.  And I say no.  I say no because you are indeed correct, those things are unrealistic.  But what do I want from you?  I want you to admit that you are greedy, that you are human just like the rest of us, that greed is a key segment of human nature, that you and I are both physical embodiments of greed.  AND YOU YELL WITH FRUSTRATION, BUT WHAT DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHY FORMAL CLOTHING WILL EVENTUALLY BURY OUR CULTURE IN A BACKWARDS DOOM OF CHAOS AND CORRUPTION IF IT IS NOT ELIMINATED?!  And I say, damn bitch hold your fucking horses, I haven't even gotten to the point yet.  Let's recap: society got the idea that t-shirts, baggy pants and fishnets are shabby, rugged and informal from human nature.  Human nature is reflected through our actions as humans, and humans are greedy.  This means that human nature has a pure element of greed.  So how did the greed in human nature define what clothes are considered informal, rugged and shabby?  The questions, my dear Watson, is not how the greed in human nature defined certain clothes as informal, rugged and shabby, but rather how the greed in human nature made a separation between formal and shabby, rugged and informal clothing in the first place, and for what purpose.  So first we must ask ourselves why the greediness in humans would want to establish a concept of formal and informal clothing.  Chew on this: Can greed be greedy for greed?  Let me put it in context: a businessman is the head of a relatively large company, with a great deal of capital potential.  Let's take the one and only Enron for example.  The businessman is the CEO of Enron, the head hancho, the king of the hill, the full Monty, the big l√© mooch.  However, he lives in a moderate sized house, in a normal, middle-class neighborhood in the city.  His kids go to public school and his wife works part time at the local preschool.  He is greedy in the sense that he makes sure that he claims enough resources for himself so that he can keep his family living comfortably without many worries, whether those be financial or safety-wise.  But at a primal level, greed is always something that strives for more.  So let's say that the businessman somehow comes to a point where he is offered a lucrative set of stock options, ones that are sure to have high returns.  Now the businessman's primal greed starts to take over.  He now wants more money, a more lavish life style, a penthouse downtown, a Bentley and a private jet, a hot secretary to fuck on the side.  But in order to get these wishes of his, he must lose his morality and ethics and make decisions that will ruin other people's lives.  This is the question: Can the business man's greed actually strive for more greed, so that it can reach those goals, or can the business man's greed be greedy enough to make those decisions on its own?  Or can the man's greed be greedy enough to make others greedy for him, and then make the decisions to cover up his ass.  Can his greed be greedy at all?  Is this question fundamentally flawed?  The answer to these questions are open to interpretation, however the bottom line is that the business man has the ability to move from his current moral high ground to the corrupt corporate scoundrel that we all know of.  And this is where everything else comes into play.  The founders of our society were men like these.  And by founders I do not mean our Founding Fathers, no.  Thomas Jefferson was long dead by the time our cultures real founders started making changes.  The founders of our society were corporate shmucks.  They didn't give a hoot about the future, except along the lines of financial prosperity.  They wanted more, and they used our society to get it.  It was these founders that introduced the ideas that shaped our society's ideas of formal and informal clothing.  Why?  In order to understand this, we must first understand the affects formal clothing has had on our society.  One anomaly that you might have run into already is that formal clothing is not something recent.  Formal clothing has been around since the days when feudalism still was the way of the land in Europe, and chivalry was still livin' strong.  In reality, formal clothing was even more predominant back then than it is now.  But when I say that the idea of formal clothing in our society originated with big business, I mean the new meaning of formal clothing.  This meaning, what I shall call the purpose of formal clothing, is what I hate.  It is the new purpose of formal clothing, the one created by big business, which has screwed over our culture.  Screwed over?  What the fuck does he mean by screwed over?  What I mean by screwed over is how formal clothing has fundamentally changed how our society functions, and why our culture is only suffering from these changes.  Let me break this issue down into 3 easy to swish-and-spit sections: 1.) Past Motives 2.) Present Affects 3.) Future Implications Shall we start in order...  Le Numero Uno: Past Motives The motives of the founders of our society not only had many clear and precise long-term goals, they also had a whole slew of short-term objectives that they kept in mind when introducing their new interpretation of formal clothing.  What was their interpretation of formal clothing?  To them, formal clothing was a tool they could use to manipulate large percentages of the population, and implement new and lasting cultural paradigms.  Big business, i.e. the founders of our society, were as smart as they were exploitive.  They reshaped our idea of formal clothing not all at once in one large brainwashing scheme, but over a period of time where it would go more or less unnoticed.  They introduced their "tool" into American society during key changing points in our culture.  The most recent of these introduction periods was during the Great Depression.  We all know that big business leased huge sums of money to the government, and in doing so bought themselves a small part of our country.  How small?  Where?  I, ladies and gentlemen, am talking about a 1/8 of the little place we call Washington D.C.  They bought power in our government, and used it to make small changes in this country.  What were these small changes?  That remains a mystery, as only big business knew what they themselves were up too entirely.  However, their motives were known.  What did they want formal clothing to do for them?  First of all, formal clothing could pressure the middle class, as well as the lower classes, into holding themselves to a standard that was set by the upper class.  By this I mean that in the old old old days, all the rich people ALWAYS wore formal clothes.  There wasn't an alterative.  Now, with formal clothing as a required commodity at important functions, people in the lower/middle classes began to hold themselves to this same standard, that only the noble and well off dressed in their formal clothes, and to walk into a ball in jeans and a t-shirt made you look like a "ruffian," a no good lowlife.  big business likes this mentality, and they can use it to their advantage.  Wait a second, Modesty?  What about MTV and whore like... well, whores!  Let's travel back in time to a little period called the Elizabethan Era.  Now, what was one thing that women did back in this time?  They covered their bodies from chin to toe in clothing.  Nothing could show, except for the front of the face and MAYBE the hands (gasp!)  Why did they do this?  Cause previously, people had been runnin' around with their clothes practically flyin off, and modesty was shot to hell.  And eventually people became disgusted with it and decided that everything must go: No more public orgies, multiple wives, scantly clad clothing, Michael Jackson... the list goes on.  And this created a cycle.  Eventually people got mad because of all the conservative influences that were taking the fun out of life, so people started showing more skin again.  Now, what is better for a business financially: being able to predict trends in society, or being able to predict trends in society?  Not only could the business profit off these trends, they could guarantee that it would happen over and over again!  So, you ask, how does formal clothing create this trend?  As I said before, formal clothing instilled ideas in our heads of what is and isn‚Äôt appropriate in certain situations.  Eventually these ideas became intertwined and swing either way, which dictates the current phase of the trend we are in.  If the formal clothing idea swings into that of what is informal, then we have a new conservative ear in our culture.  If it goes the other way, then sex is in.  Now, we all know that adults do not dictate these trends single handedly, no sir-ree.  This is where the youth come in.  The adults are the people who begin the initial swing, but it is the youth that carries it out.  If the youth are liberal horny sex machines, then the adults become more conservative.  Since the adults control the government and society, they push a conservative, modest influence into society.  Then the adults die off, and the youth become the adults, and their children become the next youth.  However the conservative influence remains from the previous adults, the new youth grow up in this conservative lifestyle.  Then this generation of youth gets fed up with the censorship, and introduces liberal reforms.  This process repeats, and we have the trend that big business profits off of.  Let me also get it straight that this trend does not occur as quickly as I just explained it.  This cycle repeats maybe once, twice, even possible three times at the most during a century.  Big business could still use this to their advantage, by controlling the media to keep the trend going, and even make it stronger.  These, my underlings, were the factors that motivated the founders of our culture to introduce their spin on formal clothing.  Le Numero Dos: Present Affects I'm scared.  Not only am I scared, I am empowered.  It is the threat that is currently facing our generation that has empowered me.  I cannot sit here, twiddling my thumbs without thinking how fast our culture is going down the toilet, and yet nobody seems to care.  Adults Are Oblivious, Children Are Ignorant, politicians are happy.  Not All politicians, But The Ones Who Choose To Ignore The Threat Of Our Impending Doom.  Our society is in a headlock, crippling under the pressure of Gun-Ho fuckers without a sense of future.  Hello, were not in faking Kansas anymore.  We never WERE in goddamn Kansas.  Fuck Kansas.  The word Kansas really looks like a piece of shit word too after you stare at it for a while.  Let me indulge you on the current destructive forces milling at our society.  We are headed into another turn of the knob.  Yes, the other phase of the trend.  The omens are everywhere you look: MTV, national thong sales, George Bush, gay marriage, the war in Iraq- these things all add up to one thing; conflict.  And when we hit conflict, all goes to hell.  We are living in a liberal society for the most part, in terms of cultural ideals.  But that is quickly changing.  BAMM! The Supreme Court puts George Bush in office.  BAMM! Enron collapses.  BAMM! 9/11 scares the suburbanites shitless.  BAMM! Bush lies to Americans to get revenge on the guy who tried to assassinate his daddy.  BAMM! Janet Jackson‚Äôs tit falls out during the Super Bowl.  BAMM! Clear Channel drops Howard Stern after being fined by the FCC.  BAMM! Malpractice insurance rates driving doctors out of business because of frivolous lawsuits.  BAMM! Emeril adds some more butter; the U.S. gets fatter.  WAKE UP AND SMELL THE GASOLINE FOLKS!  Oh wait, THERE ISN'T ANY!  We are returning to the Conservative agenda that screwed over our country years ago, and American is just letting it slide right fucking by.  Formal Clothing has given a medium for the conservative media to exploit us.  FOX NEWS! GETTIN THE CONSERVATIVE BLUES!  While the Catholic Church rapes your brother and NOBODY GIVES A SHIT!  MAYBE ONCE THEY SEE THE SHIT ON HIS FACE THEY'LL START CARIN'!  And Despite these horrible realities, there is still hope.  Howard Dean kicked ass, except he wouldn't have gotten elected.  Michael Moore is the shiznit, but that whole Disney thing was kinda shabby.  WHERE IS RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE WHEN WE NEED THEM!  Change is possible, but it takes work, time, balls, guts, Benjamins, and a face.  If we don't start making changes soon, then in 60 years when were old and shriveled we'll have to say, "Yep, formal clothing led to the downfall of our society."  How pathetic is that.  Le Numero Tres: Future Implications The systematic brainwashing of our society led by formal clothing must be stopped.  If we do not band together to fight this greater evil, then it will lead our culture into a new Dark Age, where all of the progress we have made in recent years will be lost.  How?  The Question my underlings is not How is it going to destroy our society, for that is quite obvious.  The Question should be, What can we do about it?  But considering I‚Äôve already written this much it‚Äôll probably take me a couple more days to explain this part.  So instead, I will answer the How questions.  How will it lead us into a Dark Age.  Let me lay it out for ya'.  As our society becomes more conservative, people will begin to where formal clothing everywhere, not just at important functions.  So what‚Äôs the big deal. you say.  The big deal is that suddenly the control factor is gone.  Before, big business always dictated the trend of liberalism to conservativism in our culture.  But not fashion trends.  But you, you say, fashion trends change with current political trends, like how scantly-clad clothes are more popular during liberal times, while turtle necks and collars are more common in conservative times.  I say sure, but wait a second.  Formal clothing, unlike all other common clothing that we wear today, carries along an impression with it.  People think that formal clothing separates them from the rest of the masses, that for the time they are wearing it they suddenly have some higher importance.  These ideas have lasted through trends, and do not dissolve.  So if formal clothing becomes everyday clothing, then these ideas will become everyday also.  But hold up, you say.  Why hasn't formal clothing become the dominant choice for common clothing before?  Because we never had a chance to stick with it.  Think back: World War I, World War II, Korea and Vietnam.  But not Iraq.  Why not?  Because of terrorism.  Terrorism is a threat to our nation that people can't comprehend, so instead they leave it up to their leaders. Mr. President, why is my daddy dead?  Because he realized how great his country was, and that he was willing to do anything to make sure that the people of his country and you would live better lives.  But why is he dead Mr. President?  I don‚Äôt understand.  Well son, your dad was fighting some very bad, evil people.  These people threatened this country.  They threatened him, her, them, this people of this city, of this entire country- and you.  And you were the most important thing to him, so he decided to fight to the end, just for you.  But whom was he fighting?  People who hate freedom son, people who don't understand what is so great about life here in America.  Where are they?  Did he make them go away?  Well son, these people are everywhere, and your dad was fighting a group of them.  There are so many, that this country has to draft your older brother to fight too.  Just for you, son.  Just for you.  but when will they go away Mr. President, when?  When they realize how great freedom is.  That's when.  And when will that be?  Soon son, soon.  What can I do to help?  Ha-ha, well your only 5.  You'll have to wait another 13 years if you want to enlist.  But when your old enough, I'm sure you'll know what the right thing to do is.  But what can I do now?  I wanna to help now!  Stay alert son!  If you see anything that doesn‚Äôt look right, then tell an adult.  Do your part now, and you could save millions of people lives, just like your dad.  Gee thanks Mr. President!  I almost forgot that my dad died in a war that didn't have a clear enemy, goal or purpose!  I can't wait to sacrifice my life for a lying, manipulating bastard like yourself when I'm old enough!  But until then, I'll just pretend I live in late 18th century France and your Maximilien Robespierre, and instead of this being the War on Terror, it's the Reign of Terror!  And its my job as a responsible citizen to make sure I tell the government whenever some talks bad about you, Mr. President, because your just a good person and they don't believe in freedom if they don't like you!  I love my country! Do you want the next youth generation to grow up like this?  In our modern world, when people willingly decided to do stupid shit like this, and embrace conservative values, formal clothing reign supreme.  It will rise up, unstoppable because it is imposed on our society not by big business, which can moderate it, but by ourselves.  If formal clothing becomes commonplace, so will conservative values.  The Church will gain power, scientific progress will end, and military progress will proceed.  The remnants of the fun culture that we lived by, the truly free culture, will all but disappear.  And society will pause in progress, and begin to reverse.  Everything that we learned, our computer technology, our world connectivity, our world languages, our writing, our knowledge, our freedom, will undo itself.  We will forget everything, leaving nothing but uniformity and a homogenous society.  The freedom that we attempted to preserve will be gone.  Nothingness will become everything.  This, ladies and gentle men, I call the Tivo Affect.   I have shown you how formal clothing came about as a tool of big business in our culture, how it affects us today, and how it is gradually unwinding the delicate thread of our civilization.  And if I could replace the mindset that governs formal clothing in the brains of people, I would replace it with this new logic:  End the homogeneousness.  Do not strive to be the same; leap to be different.  Embrace the eccentric, outcast the followers.  Do not call people Posers, cause the only Posers are the people that call people Posers (-the words of Mark Gonzales).  Individuality is the answer, not the reject idea.  Fuck the stiff.  Love the new.  And don't forget to pimp out in those penguin tuxes.

      I have had a semi-epiphany.  Now your probably thinking that this is just another one of my shitty ideas but this is different, coz' it ain't an idea about a project. At least not really.  It's an idea about the ideas I have for projects. What is the one problem that I  ALWAYS  have when it comes to projects? The lack of funding.  I have no cash for this shit.  This is what my semi-epiphany is about. I don't like to restrict myself, so previously I have avoided setting any perameters for what I can and cannot do.  This time however, I'm giving myself one tinsy winsy restriction: a budget.  This time the sky ain't the limit in the financial department.  From now on I will be working only on stuff that is very cost efficient and organized.  This is completely different from what I've done before.  Here's my issue:  because of my new restriction, I will have to put all of my previous projects on indefinite hold.  These include but are not limited to:    The Pimped out, rocket/motorcycle engine powered Radio Flyer   The Pirate Radio Station   Turning my upper deck into a Pirate ship (see above)   Making my room the epicenter of Modern design and counterculture   Transforming into the Urban Cowboy    Although I am sad that I have to put these projects on hold, I'm glad that I have a new path and frontier to conquer, and a fresh start to keep me motivated. In the words of Monster Garages Jesse James: "Damn, that's bitchin'."

      So John Kerry gave his speech last night at the Democratic National Convention, and I must say that he was alright.  He didn't let the crowd clap enough, which may have hurt him.  He did have lots of really good quotes though, and those should help him in the fall.  Here is my ranking of the best speeches given at this year's DNC:     Barack Obama Good speech, appealed to a broad audiance, performed under pressure; very good keynote address   Hillary Clinton Not the most important speech, but a very, very good one; even though she was just introducing someone, she managed to bring up many good points   Al Sharpton Not only the funniest speech I saw, it was probably the most motivating, in a weird, Al Sharpton-type of way; he combind preachy-volume and buildup with harsh critisism of Bush- just what the doctor ordered

      Tropicana Pink Lemonade = Pure Shit They call this a liquid?!  It's fucking sugar!  And I don't mean liquid sugar either, I mean real whole solid sugar; I felt it in my mouth.  Now that is just not right.  I started sweating after I had two sips, even though it's caffeine free, non-carbonated, and I wasn't on eBay.  Speaking of pure shit, I saw "The Rundown" with the Rock today and it sucked almost as much.  Semi-cliches are the next big thing.  News Flash: If we had better space program, then we could get rid of all of our Nuclear waste easy, but instead we have to put it in some mountain for 10,000 years.  Not to mention transport it through Chicago.  Quick Tip:  IKEA is great cause they have modern furniture and Swedish meatballs.  Everything I need to forget I'm in America for 3 hours.  I Need to play poker.  I haven't played in fricken forever.  When we seein' Will Smith?

      Check out the Stuff page, its got News for the New.  I need to get that webcam... best part about it is that I can take it anywhere where theres a net connection and still upload it to the site.  That means I could hide it in someones house and watch them eat dinner.  Or watch people in Starbucks.  Or I we could have battles and turn em into a web-show.  We could build forts and shit.  And Catapults!  NEW IDEA:  A MOCK WARFARE LEAGUE!  We have people make teams and then they get to spend one day making their fort on a field with the other teams.  They would be evenly spaced apart.  Then the next day they would do battle, and the team with the last fort standing wins.

      If Competence is in the eye of the beholder, then this world is truely not controlled by anyone.  Not that it ever was or is today, but the whole idea of any one person or group having control over a large amount of something that isn't their's is fundamentaly flawed.  As of matter of fact, control itself is meaningless.  This is no epiphany, but think about it.  If someone says they control the town over there, where towns people live and do business, what puts them in control.  If someone twists your arm and tells you to suck it, or puts a gun to your head and tells you to give 'em the money, how are they in control.  If it was your life plan to be robbed, wouldn't you be then in control, by being able to munipulate life events and control them so that you eventually are mugged?  Control is like many other ideas that make up our society: meaningless, powerful and efficent.  Why do I bring this up?  Cause it popped into my head.  The Radio Flyer may very well become one of my life's great works.  Most likely my life's only great work.  And it is indeed Great.  Pointless shmucks can't compete.  QUESTION: Am I the only person of the people who read this that dosen't wear jeans or denim in general?  I can't stand jeans, coz' they never fit and are stiff as hell, not to mention heavy.  Khakis kick ass.  They are flexible, light weight, and I couldn't care less if they get dirty.  Jeans on the other hand naturaly look dirty, so they need to be constantly washed.  Dirt enhances Khakis, and accents their already stylin' selves.  I bring this up because I want to get a pair of batwing chaps for the holidays, and being classic Cowboy wear, they look better when worn with jeans.  So I will have to break this paradigm, and become the Khakin Cowboy, Urban Defender of the Undefended!  Regrets: The lassoing bet is off cause I have other more important matters to pursue, mainly being the Radio Flyer and getting in shape.  If anyone has a problem with that, then I shall challenge them to a one-on-one duel.

      Roundtrip ticket to Grandparent's house: $138 Gas money for 8 passenger Minivan: $49 Two nights in Best Suites Hotel: $73 Wedding gift with card: $405 200 Republican relatives with nothing to talk about: Priceless  Some things money can't buy.  But Hell on Earth sure isn't one of them.   Ahh, the joys of childhood.  John Kerry has picked John Edwards as his running mate, and already Fox News has people commenting on their possible homosexual relationship.  I have final realized how destructive politics are in this country.  Politics make this country weak by dividing us, and that is why this nation is suffering.  Countries can achieve great things when united, or fuck up really bad when not.  Rush Limbaugh makes me sick.  So does the flu.  Once upon a time, there was a little duck.  One day, this duck went to see his uncle.  When he saw his uncle outside his house fishing, the duck quacked, "Uncle!"  The little duck's uncle looked up and saw his nephew, and greeted him with open wings.  Then a hunter shot the uncle.  And so the little duck ran back to his home and called the FBI.  Soon a crime seen was setup where the shooting had occured.  Apparently this was not the first shooting, and the FBI was already hot on the tail of the renegade hunter.  And so the FBI asked Congress to pass a bill that would require all citizens to have an I.D. card, that they must carry with them at all times.  This way, the FBI could track down the hunter easier.  Soon the FBI needed mroe help, and called the CIA.  They put a spending bill through Congress as part of the Department of Defenses "Black Budget" that would allow them to tap and record all phone, mail, and electronic forms of communication without authorization.  Soon the FBI caught the hunter, and publicised the story widely, to gain public support for the agency.  However, even though renegade hunters were not at large and crime rates were down to an all time low, the FBI and CIA asked Congress to repass the old bills.  Congress did as they were told, fearing that questioning the bill would cause them to loose public support in the next election.  And so the little duck grew old, and soon he became an uncle as well.  But he was run over by a semi on I-94, and was squashed like a peanut-butter and jelly sandwich in a second graders lunch.  Weather is weather.  No getting around it.  I'm done with that shit.  I was stuck on the god damn plane for an hour because of a rain delay from a thunderstorm.  Fat toes- don't need rings.  Words of California's biggest J-E-L-L-O fan, the one and only Mr. P.  Radio Flyer Update: I'm working on the chassis right now, trying to incorporate different aspects of the Radio Flyer body and design.  This will most likely be the second longest phase, next to building it.  Once I finish the main designs I'll need a drafter to help me clean 'em up.  Right now we cannot and will not call this a go kart.  Why?  Because a Radio Flyer deserves better.  Way better.

      I'm in Michigain, so thats why I haven't written in a while.  I officially am scared of WalMart.  The people in that place give me the heeby-jeebies.  I've met more republicans that want to destroy free speech for liberals while thinking that they are fighting for freedom by supporting the war than I ever want to meet again unless I'm drunk as a skunk and need a fight to pick with a pitch fork and a launtern.  Speaking of lawnmowers, I took apart one two days before tommorow's yesterday, and put it back together.  And it ran.  Very very well.  So well that I have been inspired (you know where this is going) to begin another project, by reviving an old one.  Yes ladies and gents,  THE RADIO FLYER HAS RETURNED!  Instead of it being rocket powered however, it will use a lawnmower engine.  It might even be finished in time for Mexican Independence Day!  I have many stories to tell when I return home, which will be on the 18th I believe, ranging from kick ass relatives to non-kick ass cleaning ladies.  I hate to do admit it, but for the time being, meaning TEMPORARILY, I do have a [the crowd cringes] cell phone.  If anyone happens to have an emergency requiring aid concering nail polich to carburators, please descretely drop me a line at 773-314-6608.

I will also attempt to either a.) take apart "the phone" and remove its SIM card and try to put it in the old Motorola, and switch the service, or b.) replace the innards of the Motorola with those of "the phone."  Either way, when it's I'mza gonna need some help pimpin' out this phone, aka. fur coating with a horn and a beer-mug handle.  Anyone with any artistic/manic depressive qualities please contact me or be contacted by a contactor who is contacting.
