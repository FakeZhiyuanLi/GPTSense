      it's practically a miracle that i'd ever post again, but strange enough, i am. vacation time usually pisses me off in some way or another. both sides of the family (mom's side, or dad's side) fighting for more time, or an alliance. screw them. then there's usually the day before we go to hilton head (ahem, today) where at first the adults are nice and sweet, then by night time, they're askin' u to get the hell down here and do somethin' for once in u'r life. trust me, u don't wanna know what it's like the morning we leave.   what's even more frustrating is only a days difference between each trip. now that could piss anyone off. i mean, i don't really care that much for tenn. and the beach is ok, but why the hell do they have to be right after another?  prolly the only good thing to think about is taking ryan on the beach and praying that he doesn't eat the sand, and hopefully eric will have left ashley by the time i've gotten back. i have no idea when he got back from nc, i pray it was today or yesterday.  well screw the blog, i'm sick of typing. look for another post in about a month or so...or when something dramatic happens. ~Annie

      ok well, i don't really get why we have blogs or why we join one(unless u're ordered to), but i'll give it a try. blog is sucha ugly name noways. alright well, you've come here to find out a lil about me so here it goes...i'm 15(#24!), entering the 10th grade, and i go to wren high. who cares?  well let's go over a string of events. it's summer(thank god), so the only thing to do is go out w/ u'r friends right? you should go to los amigos, (while laughing at the one that burnt down) then walk over to a string of stores and get a guy to buy you movies, gum, and pretty pens. it's just the right thing to do. then of course after church you have to pack the truck up w/ 5 teenagers, and go to don pablos! first you annoy the waiter by not being able to order the 3 times he came, then you must leave, be scared to death while the driver is going 100mph on the interstate, and go to bilo. while you're in bilo convince one of your friends to get into a shopping cart and hold on to the back of the truck. yes and make it a sunday.  well some interests of mine are drawing, and writing. one day i hope to make some flashes, but not anytime soon, because that actually takes disapline, and sticking w/ your work...o yeah and having the flash program. so in the meantime i've dedicated my life to just do sports next school year.  ok well there's my first post, i'll prolly post again when i'm fussed at...

      hmmm august 5th 2004 school started. yay!...yay. getting up at 5:30 am to garantee you have a shower is a pretty good downside. but seeing everyone is almost worth it. until your makeup gets screwed up in the heat, but winter should be better for that. damn humidity. so far though, it's been pretty good. my favorite class is prolly study hall. you can do virtually nothing in there. it's a wonderful thing. so what you don't get any credits, u'll be fine. unless u'r dumb. then haha. i'm pretty sure that english and math will bore me to tears this school year. well ok i'm positive about that. i wish so bad that i had been put into math tech II, it would have put a lot of stress and worry off my shoulders. i guess it's the test thing in algebra, where u HAVE to pass. how gay is that? and 90 friggin' minutes, arg. it could kill anyone. i dunno about english though. the teacher just seems....snotty, and moody. there's just something about her...guess we'll have to see. but global studies seems like a blast. i befriended the teacher very quick. she seems like a slight ditz, and is very disorganized. quite funny too, so we're very alike. matty, sarah, and ha! jill is in that class. poor poor matty. speaking of matty, whoa matty. it's been a crazy past few days huh? hopefully next time you like a girl, tell them a few more weeks before they're about to date someone. it can save u'rself, and the girl a lot of stress. but in a way i'm glad do you know why? because that i told eric, he jumped out there to ask me out, because he was afraid he was gonna lose me...i think. so in a way thank u. but now i'm slightly pissed because he hasn't called. and no matter what matt, i'm can't go running to u w/ a problem, because u know what u'll say? "i told u so," and that would piss me off more than you'll ever know darling. i guess do have a little homework i must complete, i have to write a paragraph about a girl i don't even know. i had to interview her, she was...out there. well u know, the usually preppy girl trying to be nice, or at least i think . end of post. ~Annie.

      it's a downright sin to wake up before 10 am. that's why school's a sin. but still when u'r mother works 3rd shift and decides u need to get u'r schedule back on time, it's.....a horrible time for everyone. when i say everyone it does affect the people around me, because i'll attack. yes, i'm very, very sleep deprived.  hmmmmm, my sister's watching one of her favorite all time movies~The Ring....damn the phone just rang, and it made me wanna pick up mine. but man her exboyfrined in the movie was actually pretty cute, but short. but seriously what skitzo would actually convince herself that she had been affected with a video and it becomes the essense of a chain letter? but then after 7 days i guess you are convinced.....i'd definatly be dead. the best part in that movie is where the creepy lil girl is saying how she does want to hurt people, now that's just awesome! i saw her on the mtv movie awards one time though, and she turned out to be a real life ditz. what a shame. she could have been the next manson, angelina jolie or something and had every excuse, but she's just a stupid lil girl. that kind of disappointed me. i guess i expected her to be more mature, and pretty, but how can u be pretty if u'r a living corspe walking out of a television. i guess i deserved that disappointment for making that assumption.  o this part is so cool too, when the horsey freaks out and commits suicide. i never knew horses were capable of such emotions, 'til this movie. hmmmm.....oh there he goes....about to jump off a boat......he's running.....oh, he jumped!....ok going under the ship....................AND THERE'S THE BLOOD! HAHA. the girl's screaming o well. she should have tied up her horse better in case he wanted to jump into the ocean, u should see how much i tie my lil brother up. he's not going anywhere anytime soon.  ok the reason for long (at least for me) absolutely pointless post is because it's 11:02 am and there's no one worth talking to...everyone's asleep! ::sigh:: well, this is the most following post yet, u never now, there might even be a 5th one, one day. ~Annie

      lovely lovely school in 4 days. summer sure flies, and hell i'm more glad than any of you will ever know. this is a summer that i would, and wouldn't trade for the world. i honestly never thought one human being can go through so much heartbreak and joy in such little time. two months can definatly change a person.  arg, and those damn vacations that i could definatly do without. they're suppose to clear u'r mind and so on, but it does the absolute opposite for me. i guess it's just the average teen obesession with there social life or something, but i swear if i couldn't use the phone at least once, it pitched a downright fit like a 5 year old. that made me realise how i refuse to take a break from reality. which isn't a good thing, definantly not at all. then i do the wonderful thing of depressing myself if they don't answer, or if they cancel plans. sometimes i think i'm a first class shitzo, but hey life's screwy.  so i guess that's why i'm so excited about school starting so soon. i miss my friends dearly. prolly also since i've moved in w/ my mom, i want to prove that i can excel. not that i needed that to move in w/ her. i could have excelled anytime i wanted to, but that's the problem u see, if i want to. i procrastinate, and if a subject bores me, i purposely zone out.  so this year (like i've said every year since the....6th grade) i'm going to excel in high school! stop laughing...really.  ok well, i don't feel like typing anymore. that's a lie. i just don't know exactly what else to say but this. so read this blog in another....few months and maybe, just maybe they'll be another post. ~Annie
