      Redorange flames coat the evening sky with  beauty beyond all restraint,  hung as if it 'twas a glorious  painting in which no painter  nor artist, of any kind,  would dare attempt discredit  of thy markings of true heaven's life,  for as late evening light fades,  the once gentle breeze has swollen to angers own breath,  the beauty of the sky disperses  and 'tis soon replaced with burst of lighted night  and followed by thy darkness roar,  for the creator ‘tis the only one  who knows of thy's true beauty,  who’s acknowledged of thy trues kept in the  deepest mists of ones soul and heart,  strung of secrets and marked of lies,  the truth is unknown and faced  with lying fate,  ‘Tis the journey back  starts once again,

      To hold her tight in my arms  till the pink glow dims in the darkness of the night and spring light opens the new day, To warm and comfort when the cold days come by, to take part in her happiness and joy and to watch her each graceful step against the cool mornings breeze, to hold her close and to be mezmerised with the love coming from  each of her sparkling eyes. to be able to take one look in her eyes and know there is love there, to hear her sweet voice in my ear telling me so

      A garden of which the night seed plants the new days light, where life stands with beauty and keen standing far, yet in sight, when the light glistens off morning dew night light shines the scene, evening color now blending with the new the old no longer seen, the blaze of heat now icy cold blossoming, blooming, then started again, beauty covering all, yet not the soul, pure, yet plagued with sin

       A beautiful coat covering from the mounting peaks of the mountains to the endless prairie below, its beauty shines in the days sunlight and the moonlight in the night, coming in plentiful supply from high above as solid white stars thrown from  angels from the heavens, one ever so gently landing on the other, giving everything a gorgeous view, as long as it lies there, its beauty will never die,

      The inner light breeze cold as ice yet feels of mid morninings gentle warmth lightly cool yet so suffice the silent flow back and forth evening glow lights the sky as night stars loom the heavens the gentle wind heaves a sigh the days long in sequence of seven deepening within morning sight deafening silence rose beyond sweet solance gained yet so, the day opens with beauty's light all hidden showing neither false nor sane

      The sky claimed by the darkened night the stars deprived upon heavens plain as last of day sun fades from sight for none of all remain the same as bitter cold merges with new light yet lack of warmth for all is sane a fierce silence rose upon the solance forced might yet deafening quiet stood in vain

      Sparkling like no other shining stars in heavens sky, slowly formed within night each gracefull step as keen sight shows no lie the beauty in time shall still be kept seeing forth another day upon the great plain seeking that if which is unknown  for none is lost with yet to gain ending all with lack of tone
