      I have decided to only update this once a week, wich will take place on sundays. Sorry if this disapoints my reader.  I finished my exams earlier this week. Teusday I had a complex physics exam that had material we hadnt learned on it. At first I thought I had just not known it, but then the more mentally enhanced students told me they hadnt either. Our history teacher also built us up to believe our exam would be difficult, but it was a walk in the park. Disapointment really. Until friday, I hadnt done a thing, besides read, alot. Colleen leant me the released Harry Potter books. I have been reading them heavily and expect to be done the fifth one by early july. I went to meet Colleen and Heather firday morning at their school. We went downtown and went to the Cybernet cafe for a while. Colleen beat me at chess, but I shall crush her into the ground next time we play. I "ownzed" them both at three way euchre. What? I have to gloat about something. We met Terrance at the bus depot and later on ended up at Comics North where we read manga silently on the floor for nearly an hour. To my surprise, we werent booted out. After eating, curtesy of Terrance, we found Kyle and went to bell park to meet Heather's piece of meat. We didnt see him so we whent back home. After being lazy for a while, we brought Kyle to the checkpoint where his mother picked him up. Returned home, watched "The Boondock Saint" wich was a good movie, considering the type it was. Eventually got a rid to the bus depot and went home. Whent to bed fairly early that night.  Thursday(before all that) I went golfing with Martin, for the first time. It was fun, worth sitting around swarmed by flies. I look forward to going with him again this week, when I could scrap some money. I also went to the course in Onaping. I didnt like it to much, the holes were also right next to each other and I felt sort of rushed. Still overall alot of fun.  Over and out.

      From friday to present, sunday.  I woke up friday morning early enough to get to the stables. Shame no one was there. I few weeks ago I asked lacy when they trained and she exclaimed everyday, save sunday. I was disapointed, I really looked forward to going. So I spent the rest of the day in front of the computer and playing DDR. Finaly, 3pm came around and I went downtown via city bus. I got on the bus and sat down. A few stops later two friends I hadnt seen in a year hoped on. They walked by and I said hi. They looked at me and said nothing. Either they didnt recognize me, or they are both a couple bitches. Im well over that. I arrive to ruccers(arcade) and I am immidiatly greated me Karly nad Caitlin. Karly tried to glomp me, then ran back inside, and I was lucky enough to be escorted by Caitlin inside. Just like any other time, I was happy to be able to see everyone and hop on the DDR. My biggest accomplishment that night was hittting every step(Perfect or Great) on Holic. Still no AA though. After everyone left, we decided to make our way to the building were the prom was. We walked to the bus depo to meet with friends. After meeting them Tyler went off to change. We came in contact with what seemed to be a marshmallow of a man who happened to be security. He told us if we werent waiting for a bus, we would have to vacate the premisise. Sassy came up with an ingenius plan to sack him and go, but it didnt fall through. A big surprise was to have Tyler come out with a kilt. Oh how jelous I was. We got to the prom and there wasnt anyone there, save the staff. Even after the maximum number of people showed up, there still wasnt much. I can go to much into detail, because its just like your average dance. Colleen and I walked back to her house. Upon arrival we got changed and went to go eat fries with pasta+sour cream/chive kinda sauce. I really enjoyed that. Afterwards, we went to pick up Heather from her outing, along with Caitlin. They said "The Chronicles of Riddik" wasnt that bad, but I still have no interest in it. Getting back home, we watched the movie "Amelie" wich was amazing. I havent seen a movie that good in a while. I enjoyed it, but Colleen and Heather passed out fairly early during the presentation. After the movie, her mom brought them back to their rooms and we went to bed.  Heather decided to wake me up in a non-original way. She took a snapshot of me. I dont really mind, but its not my favorite way to wake up. After talking for 30 minutes of talking, we went down stairs and ate wheaties. Colleen and I had two options, we could stay home and study, or go to the camp and study. We decided to go to camp. We talked for a bit and she gave me the camp tour. We got on the boat with our stuff, drove away and got to studying. When I say study, you must understand we did nothing. All we did was talk and browse through our notes and talked. We then came to a conclusion we should study like that more often. We got back to shore and sat down with Caitlin and talked. By that time, a van load of their friends arrived. Colleen and I went to go snooze on the boat again. Caitlin came and talked with me. Thats really the first time I had a long conversation with her, I really enjoyed her views on things and we hit it off well. All of the other girls I didnt know to well were gone, the ones I did know(not to much) came to join us and we had a good conversation. We then went bowling, that was muchos fun. I really love bowling, and with good friends like that, it was enhanced. Went to pizza hut, did the thing people do there and went outside. We were attacked by a hoard of mosquitos. Bad experience. Our ride arrived and we went back to Colleen's house. We spent the night playing DDR. Their mat is hopeless, so we just played with the controllers. Took me abit to get used to it, but I got it down fast. I can do songs on heavy easily. I dont want to get addicted to that, I want to keep playing on my mat, but I know im going to get lazy soon. Colleen passed out first yet again while Caitlin and I played. They decided to get to bed and I crashed on the couch again.  This morning(sunday), I was awakened by poking and lethal tooth picks. After I survived that experience, I hit the showers. After a nice warm one, we went downstairs and ate. We decided to play a game of Euchre. Colleen and I show our massive card playing skills and defeated Heather and Caitlin into the ground. Her mom decided to make pancakes, yummerz. While we ate, again, their mom and I got into deep conversation. This wasnt the first time, but it lasted a while. I could see Colleen getting bored ant tired of hearing her mother and I talk, it was cute. I really enjoy talking with older people, there is always so much that could be learnt. Then I got a ride home, yay.   Tonight I look forward to watching some television and reading Harry Potter witch Colleen lent to me. Thank you for the wonderfull week end girls, and I look forward to a repetition of this. Thank you.  Loging off.

      The only thing worth mentioning about yesterday is that Colleen yet again kept me on the phone until the batery died. Even after I told her it wasnt going to happen again, she has managed to keep it going 3 times in a row. I dont mind it actually. I have never talked on the phone so much. In my 17 year life, she is the person I talked to most, and I have only had 3 phone sessions with her.  Today was the last day of school. I dont really care all that much, I never really care that much about anything because I live one day at a time, and it dosent bother me if I need to go to school or not. Good news is I can take a break from all the conformists at my school. I also realised I dont like signing yearbooks that much. I only have 4-5 good friends that I would like to chare my two cents with, but then random people by the dozens show up for me to sign. I havent talked to them all year, what am I supposed to say? I got over that quick and fell into a repetitive signature for the ones that I rarely talked to.  Another good thing was that I manage to finaly speak freely to my teacher. And by freely I mean telling her off. All year she treated us like children. "Sit at your place", "*Places her hands on her hips* Thats not very niced" and all other things a typical kindergarden teacher would. I am not one to like this. All year she would do this and it bothered me. We quarreled verbaly several times. I can be very witty, so when she had enough she usually send me to the office. So today, after signing yearbooks in the hallway for ten minutes, I get to class. As soon as I walk in I shut the door. Theres was a strong wind current so it slammed. She got really mad and told me to go out in the hallway. I go for a little walk around the school and when I get back, there she is standing there with a chair. She actually wanted me to sit down and stay there the whole period(50 minutes). After she went back in I left to go find some friends. Before I could get down the hallway she tells me to get back in class. I can back and start walking towards my seat, but she puts a chair in the corner and tells me to sit down! I ask her politely if she has a cone I could put on my head. So tried to mock me but with my quick responses, she didnt last long. Then some of my friends brought me their yearbooks to sign. She freaks out and tells the class not to talk to me. She then makes this remark, "You see, Girls rule." while making the most idiotic face I have ever seen. I bursted laughing and implied she was sexist. She then realised her mistake and told me to go to the office. I was glad to. Later on, I went straight back to that class and stood a couple inches away from her face and say "I hate you". It seemed to hit her hard, so I am happy.  Other then that, typical day, sorrounded by the same old people. Tongight I have to study for my French exam. Grammar isnt really my thing so it might take me several hours to get it well. Im really dreading the exam, I hate French.  End transmission.

      Fuzzy got a blog, got jelous and got one myself. What is to come of this, im not to sure. I will try to post everyday when something interesting happens. Very little amuses me, so it will be often enough.  Today, I got up at my usual time(6:30am) for school. Nothing too exiting happened today, but it hit me. I cant wait to get out of school. Not because of the work, that I dont mind, but the people are being intollerable. I cant stand most of my friends anymore. Its always drunk this or I got so high back then. I could talk about that maybe once a week, but everyday? No. I plan on isolating myself from all of them over the summer, so when next year comes around I will be able to stand them at the start of the year. Nothing else to say at the moment, I must get back to my flashing chat boxes at the bottom of my screen.
