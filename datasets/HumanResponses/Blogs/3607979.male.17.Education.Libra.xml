      I guess I must overcome this self-inflicted pain on myself. That is, the illusion that she will still like me, which leads to my depression. I have to accept it, she doesn't like me, and I have no way of changing that. Sometimes it is really better if you accept things the way they are. Well that's life, you've got to move on...  Oh, by the way, I found my filemaker, I accidentally left it in DLSU.

      Damn! I knew something was wrong the moment I arrived home! I lost my filemaker! I don't know where I exactly lost it, whether was it in DLSU, the LRT, or maybe even Letran. Tsk, it's not that really important, it just contains photocopies of book pages and testpapers, but there is one problem...it contains some photocopies of the lessons we are having today...  I just hope and pray that I left it in DLSU...

      There is always a part of me that hopes that I'll know the truth of her feelings. I hope or should I say, I dream that she has feelings for me too. Well, I constanly tell myself to forget about, I guess the "out of sight, out of mind" thinking is not working for me...  I just hope that I'll survive the depression that may come if I ever know the hard truth...

      You might not believe this, but I actually wrote this blog while drinking brandy--on the rocks and mixed with cola. Heh, some of you might turn it down, but what to do? Blogs are sometimes subjected to new editions. Anyway, I'm writing my project, and of course, projects in college usually are done in three days or less...makes you miss highschool and elementary huh? I almost did two pages(with out double space) and alomst 700 words! Cool huh? Hehe...well, I guess I have to revise it in the morn, like adding something, removing wrong grammars and the like...  Well, that's all folks!

      I just learned today that many students fall into the "trap" of college life. That is, they still think its highschool for them. The parties, the gimmicks, the late-night TV shows, and of course...procrastination. Well, I guess I really shouldn't feel bad about it-missing all those parties and such--after all, my parents are having a hard time sending me to college...let's just say that I belong to those who "can't afford to fuck up" kind of people...  Well, I guess that is just for now...

      I don't want to be considered a weakling anymore...  I guess I'll have to revert back to my old self, and hope for the best that it is not counter-productive. After all, my cold, calculating, reasonable, logical self could always make me stronger. Yes, I'm without emotions again, but then if its going to help my studies...  Why not?

      Entry Start: 12:10 AM  I don't know, since this site might be run in the U.S.(hence different timelines), but that's the time that I began writings this blog. Somehow, I wish college was  EASIER . Having only a half-day schedule(morning to noon), I somehow found it hard not to do anything. Well I guess that's just the academic itch in me. And now that I am doing something, I also find it hard to do. Ironic right? Well, I guess I better stop blogging--for now--and get back to what I'm working at.  Entry End: 12:15 AM

      Actually,the official end for the midterms is tommorrow, Saturday. But then having no Saturday classes my midterm is now over. Here are some scores:  Math        : 2.0 Anthropology: 2.0 Logic       : 2.5 PEDANCE     : 0.0  Well, I didn't take the midterm exams in PE, so that explains the 0.0  Well, that's all folks!

      Well, midterm grades have been given. It's not that I failed during my midterms, except for P.E. class, but I somewhat received low grades. I got mostly 2.5's equivalent to my HS grades of 85-88. Though quite high for some I'm still disappointed.  I did get a 2.0 at Math,which is good, since my normal Math grades lie between 1.0 and 1.5, somewhat similar to 70-75.
