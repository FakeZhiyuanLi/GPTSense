       Friday, 130804 - I got replies regarding the forms. Some of them were not alarmed yet. Yesterday, I met the boss, never smiles. What should I do? Did he do that on purpose or what? If all of these are about the website things, then I can say, GO TO HELL?? Hahaha... Now, today I've got nothing much to do. Just have to prepare for the tuition in Donggongon. I went to Likas to look for the school (exam venue for KPLI). Then, I did my pray in UMS. Met the boys. Promised them that I'll stay over night there. It does make sense though, because the venue is not far enough if I go from there. So, let me think first....  OK. Confirmed. Lagipun duduk rumah pun bukan hebat sangat. Plus, I have to study for tomorrow's exam. What else, I met 'cikgu' at the mosque. My girlfriend sent me a picture of her when she was in KL attending her friend's wedding. I spent RM20 for gas using my CC. I went back at 2. Else? Hmm not much... Headache plus worried. Wanna get some sleep.. C ya..

       Today is Thursday, 12th Aug, 2004, Malaysia - I was just surfing around when suddenly the word 'Blog' popped into my head. I had a weird kind of feeling lately. With my job, my girlfriend, friends and everything. Almost.. Well, every thought counts, right? Luckily, I have this Blog to feel the emptiness of mine..pfftt. Now, I would like to contribute everything I know inside this Blog.  Okay, let's start from today. I feel down. Really down. I have these 'things' above my head. And it crushing down on me. I feel 'compressed'. For the sake of mine, let me list down all the things that keep on pinching me.   Money, for the engagement.   Job, the websites, IPD's and YB's.  Environment, I hate those eyes.   Friends, spoken words are more itchy than anything.   What I'm gonna do guys, friends, people, out there... Somebody... Can you hear me?? I need my family so bad. I've been a jerk for the past few days. My girlfriend, I love her, she never wrong. She's right all the time. It's me. I am the one who did wrong. Mistakes. I've been controlling her. Huhh??!!!! Yes, I've been controlling her. Everything. I want all the things between us under control. That's all. I think the solution is  'Try to be flexible with everything and try to control your temper.'  That's all. So, from today on, I will try my very best to become a PERFECT GUY on earth. Not for everybody, but for me. Yes, for me. Now, I will c ya tomorrow. Got tuition tonight at 7. All the best... Assalammualaikum....
