      So I'm listening to the news today, and they're talking about the damage in Florida following Hurricane Charley.    There's something like 10,000 reports of "price gouging", and the state is investigating every one as a crime.    Why is this a crime?  Why and when does the free market require government to stick its nose in and say "you can't do that"?  It's simple economics: the law of supply and demand.  If the supply of something goes way down because of a hurricane or whatever other reason, yet the demand remains constant (or goes up), it's only common sense to assume that the price is going to increase.     Maybe you think that hotel clerk is being a jerk for charging $110/night for a room that is ordinarily $40/night.  OK, fine.  Boycott his establishment then.  You're absolutely free to not patronize his place and take your money elsewhere (or nowhere).    But is that hotel clerk holding a gun to consumers' heads and FORCING them to buy his product?    I think, like most government programs, attempts to regulate the economic market have noble goals.  The government wants to take care of you and give your cheap everything so that your life is easier.  Aww, isn't that cute and cuddly?  Yaaay, government!  The problem is, of course, that it shouldn't be government's job to step in and regulate prices in a free market.  That's a dangerous slope.  I don't know about you, but I fear my government and I don't want them having any more control or power than I have.  And I certainly don't have the power to go into a hotel and force the innkeeper to charge a certain price.    Government should stay out of the free market.

      I ran into this quote today from Libertarian Presidential candidate Michael Badnarik's blog (www.badnarik.org).    "This is a race between the president of the United States and John Kerry," Bush spokesman Danny Diaz told the Santa Fe New Mexican on Wednesday when asked about the prospects of Libertarian presidential  candidate Michael Badnarik, "and voters will make their decision between those two candidates."  How pompous is that?  Sheesh.  The mentality of the two major parties who feel that they somehow have a RIGHT to the duopoly on politics that is the demopublicans is revolting.  It flies in the face of EVERYTHING this country was founded on.  Last time I checked the Constitution, it didn't say anything about being a Republican or Democrat as a requirement for election.  How completely ridiculous to assume that someone isn't qualified just because they're brave enough to stand up for freedom and liberty and run as a Libertarian instead of a donkey or an elephant.  The demopublicans completely ignore a dissenting viewpoint, just because they see the natural order of things as R's and D's in power.  That mentality is so stupid and unamerican it makes me want to spit.    I've got a clue for you, Mr. Diaz--the days of the demopublican stranglehold on public policy are numbered.  The Libertarians are gaining ground, and the people are slowly starting to realize that there is a choice.    -Rusty
