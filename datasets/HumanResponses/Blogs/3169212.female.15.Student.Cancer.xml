       Baka:&nbsp; I'm the one who started this whole thing.&nbsp; I guess I should say that a lot of this material is copyrighted, so  DON'T COPY IT !!    &nbsp;  ***  &nbsp; Koda Nikeli walked into the doorway that lead into the bar. There were many people sitting around, most of them are just blurs and didn't really matter to him. There was only one person he wanted to see.   He looked back to a shadowed corner where he could see a woman sitting alone, reclining.    Same old Jinix.  Nikeli walked to the back and sat down in front of Jinix.   "Carjul√©, you never change do you?" he asked her.   She looked up, her yellow cat eyes meeting his directly, and gave her classic Corellian smirk. "Your life wouldn't be as exciting if I changed."

      Khala groaned. According to Thellas, after the energy weapon's shot bored into her leg, she had fallen, hitting her head on the hard top of the wall.  Now, the Fremen cracked open her eyes to find her vision blurred by some sort of gel. Air appeared to be administered to her via a tube and mask from the surface, and she noticed her clothing to be a bit on the revealing end of things. Unhappy with this situation, she swam (so to speak) to the top of the tank, where she found very little life.  She groped by her side, where she found that her beloved crysknife was missing, as was her zatn'katel. That certainly would not do.  After quickly checking the nearby side of the large tank for life, Khala broke through the wires connected to what little preserved her decency, grabbed a towel, and rid herself of the strange coverings. Once this was done, she climbed down a ladder that led to the top of the odd tank, where she found her Tok'ra garb.  Finally comfortable enough to settle down a bit, she gave the room a more thorough look-over. Small beds with white coverings, each with a set of curtains ready to surround it, lined two long walls. Khala estimated that there were twenty altogether. Another strange tank towered beside hers with two more on the opposing wall. In the center of the wall to her left was a glass door, which led into a seemingly featureless hallway.  Three of the beds on the far half of the room were occupied, but on her side of the room sat only one person: a human (she did not sense any naquada). This woman sat on one of the beds, facing Khala's tank. Her head was down, and she stared at her hands.  The Tok'ra approached, cautiously watching the stranger, noting that her weaponry lay undistrubed on the sheets beside her. After slipping around the tall woman, she replaced the knife and zat on her person. "What have you done to me?" Khala asked.  Jinix looked up, her yellow, cat-like eyes catching the Tok'ra's attention. "I saved your life, for one."  "My life was not in danger."  "Well, you had a pretty bad wound."  "It would have healed shortly."  "And how would I know that?"  "My clothing."  "Why would your clothes give that away?"  "Do many species here dress as I do?" Khala asked, indicating the brown leather garb typical of Tok'ra.  "Only on Tatooine."  "And do these Tatooinians heal quickly or not?"  "I don't think they do."  "Oh." Khala's eyes widened as Thellas reminded her of her trouble with the planetary authorities. Such matters seemed so foreign to Tok'ra. "The locals. Are they still looking for me?"  "We pretty much took care of them."  "Good. We did not want to completely incapacitate them as we did customs."

      Jin watched as the girl dashed out of the bar.   What the hell?   "Koda...," Jinix was interrupted by her companion.  "I already know.  Let's go see what we can do."  Koda put some credits on the table for the ale and followed the half-breed out of the establishment.  He stayed at her heels directly, knowing that she might pull her lightsaber before knowing the whole story.  The two of them came to where the two guards were trying to climb the wall clumsily.  "Oi!  Dumb-ass duo!" she yelled to the two.  They turned their heads to see a tall, slender woman all in shadow except for the neon iridescence of a silvery green laser blade.  The guards, having not gotten far up the wall, jumped down and began walking towards Koda and Jinix.  The two Corellians remained unfased by the approaching sentinels, even when they pulled their blasters from the holsters.  "Why the hell were you chasing an innocent?" Jinix asked ferociously.  "It's none of your business.  We'll let you live if you just walk away now," responded one of them.  "No, if you bastards 'just walk away' then  we'll  let you live," Koda said.  "Fine."  One of the guards held the blaster level with Nikeli's head.  He never had the time to pull the trigger.  Jinix had suddenly turned up behind him and had shoved her saber through the guards torso.  The other guard turned to face the woman.  He had paled to a terrified milky white and, though it was dark in the alley, his pupils had reduced to the size of pinpoints.  Jinix, in an almost arrogant gesture, turned off her blade, clipped it to her side, and punched the guard in the face.  The guard was knocked out and he fell limply to the floor.  "All of that build up and that's all the action we get," she shook her hand.  "Hard jaw, though.  Nearly popped a blood vessel."  "Where'd you suppose that woman got to?" Koda asked.  "She's unconscious on the top of the wall."  "Never cease to amaze me."  Jin shrugged and leapt agily to the roof.  Nikeli followed her.  Jinix was examining the wound on the woman's leg.  "It's not bad, but not good either.  Probably should take her to the Alliance base here."  Koda lifted the light woman in his arms without a response.

      Khala finished her ale as two security gaurds came in to the bar.    We should leave now before they spot us  "You are right Aldwin," Khala headed for the door and as she did one of the gaurds recognized her and told the other gaurd," Hey you stop where you are."  Run, do not fight them just run we do not want confrontation  Khala heeded Aldwins advice and made a dash for the door all the while dodging a laser shot in the process,"HALT!" The gaurds pursued her out of the bar and down the street. Khala made a right turn down a street, then made a left with laser shot missing her by nanoinches.  She takes another left and comes apon a dead end, "Now what Aldwin, any great ideas now."  Yes climb the wall behind you and you will come out in a main street where you can lose them, I hope "That's reasurring, what the hell," she turns around and starts to scale the wall.   The gaurds round the corner and let out a barrage of shots at the wall almost nocking Khala off.  Khala makes it to the top of the wall and jumps off, but takes a shot in the right leg.  She falls towards the ground and hits and is nocked unconscience.

      As she reclined slightly in her own booth, Khala listened in on the conversation of those in the booth ahead of her. She wondered briefly if these people might provide the sense of adventure she missed since the Goa'uld had been destroyed. The Stargate had been buried on her homeworld of Arrakis, so returning home was not an option, either, even if she was certain to have a home to return to. Whatever this galaxy was that she had happened into, so far, it hadn't proved anything more interesting than helping the other Tok'ra to build their own civilization.   But these people, whoever they were, sounded as if they might help quell her thirst for adventure.    We should return to our own,   her symbiote reminded her.   They need us to help build a world that might be seen as acceptible to the Tau'ri so that the people of their world can learn of us and we can have relations with them.    Khala rolled her eyes. "When the Tau'ri first met you--us," she whispered back, her low tones blending into the din from the other customers, "they could barely accept us for who we are. What makes you think that the general population of the Tau'ri can take it? They have not seen as many strange things as the first group had."    It can be introduced to them more slowly. Also, with the Goa'uld threat gone, they will not initially believe us to be those hideous beings,   insisted Aldwin.  "The Tau'ri are no less superstitious than my own people. When  I  first met you, I wanted you to undergo the Test of Abomination or at the very least, the Test-Mashad. The Tau'ri will not accept us any easier than I accepted you. It will be as if we had to pay the Taqwa again."  While she said this, the human seated facing her in the next booth caught Khala staring at her, so the Tok'ra diverted her eyes; it would do no good to have any new suspicions here. Already, she had upset the security force guarding this world. If they found her here, both Khala and Aldwin knew that they might have to defend themselves, and that would involve physically harming or incapacitating the unfortunate souls sent to capture them. Too many years avoiding Harkonnens and Jaffa at any cost could not benefit the well-being of anyone the Tok'ra saw as an opponent.     You have too little faith in them, Khala,   Aldwin concluded.   Even if they do not initially assist a friendship between us, they will not condemn us, even as Colonel O'Neill does not.   Now, we should return and do what we can for our kind.    The Fremen nodded, again watching the other booth. "I know. We'll leave when I finish my drink." With that, she picked up the glass in front of her and took a cautious sip of the ale, carefully noting her symbiote's impressions of it.

						   Many elves and humans were walking up and down the avenue.  They had their own intents and so did Briar Letalas.  Andolin was supposed to meet him at this avenue, yet she wasn't here.  His short nerves were breaking.  He had been stood up before, by women he thought he loved, but Andy was his partner in crime and a fellow elf.  So what if she were a thief, she still had an honor code that she upheld.  He folded his arms across his chest and closed his eyes.  Elves had very sharp eyes, but they were very delicate.  Many elves prowled around at night, and did not enjoy the bright sun as the humans seemed to.  Suddenly Briar was pulled into the alley behind him by his collar.  The force threw him off balance and he fell onto the dirt ground.  It took only half a second for his vision to clear, and to see the shadowy form staring out into the crowded street.  He blinked a few times.  The figure was dressed in the clothing of Escalace, the Western Kingdom.  The character wore a black Veil to hide its face except for the eyes, with dark colored clothing.  The Westerners were often distant to outsiders, and weren't very sociable amongst themselves.  It was rather unnerving to be in the presence of one.  Of course, Andolin came from Escalace, so Briar was used to the prowess she held.  "Who are you?"  Briar stared at the Westerner.

						   The only company she had, besides Hood's hourly visists, was a decomposed skeleton that was chained to the wall.  She sighed and dropped down onto the floor with her back against the wall.  The dungeon wasn't the worst part of her capture; it was the fact that she had been caught by the invariably stupidest law enforcer in the land, it was an awful scar on her pride.  She gave another sigh, drew her knees up to her chest, wrapped her arms around them, and stared blankly across the room.  ***  Sheriff Thomas Hood sat straining over arrest papers.  He muttered about the difficult words and how he should be wandering about the village catching other pieces of  filth.  Old Tom, as the village called him, had had his moment of grandeur and boasting when he had caught the blasted elf, but it was soon to wear off with the hard leaf that lie before him.  He scratched at his balding scalp and rapped on the wooden table with an old featherless quill.  He scratched his head again twice before he placed his quill into the ink well and began to sloppily draw out the arrest record.  ***  Andolin had moved from her drawn up position and was throwing loose stones at the ugly, cracked masonary wall.  If only she had a quill and paper, her bored mind would have something to do.  What was worse, claustrophobia was beginning to settle in, and the shadows seemed to be crawling closer and closer to the young elf.  *Letalas, you'd better get her soon.*  She stood and walked to the small, barred window that didn't give much light into the dungeon.  She stood just outside the dim square on the floor.  This offered her the best view without temporarily blinding her.  ***

						    Baka:&nbsp; Hey, guys.&nbsp; I'm here too.&nbsp; Please don't copy this idea.&nbsp; I hold it dear.    &nbsp;  ***  &nbsp; The Code of the Dragon   Chapter One: Sentinel Village, Lockhana (Eastern Kingdom), Cirenhem   Andolin Dragonrider, most hunted elf in Cirenhem, was pacing in a dark, dank, reeking dungeon. She had had no food for several hours, but the sheriff would bring her a bowl of water. Not that shw was drinking it, she had no trust in the old man.

						   He opened the door that led down a flight of dark, crumbling stairs.  Saltar began his descent, his black cape drifting lightly after him.  The dungeon was not a place even he would want to stay too long.  It was damp and smelled faintly of rotting carrion.  The walls were also deteriorating, ready to fall to pieces taking the rest of the building with it.  Water could be heard dripping in from the soil, and, no matter what the temperature out side, it was always cold.  Even the lightest footsteps echoed off the old walls along with that eerie drip.  ***  Andolin could hear the door open with a creak.  All doors blocking out these conditions would.  She could hear the loose stones fall from the stair or crunch underneath the slightly faint steps that were coming closer and closer.

						   "Are you questioning my expertise?" the voice asked with a devious ferocity.  Hood got a panicked look on his face.  "No, S...Saltar.  I...I was just...," he managed to stutter as a black gloved hand grabbed his huge neck and began to squeeze.  The speaker had stepped close to the fat sheriff.  Saltar lifted him from his wooden seat by the neck and was dangling him a good few inches in the air.  Saltar was an evil sorcerer that used magic to manipulate anything he couldn't naturally.  His appearance also suggested of his power.  He had thick, short, black hair that was slicked back away from his brow.  He was dressed in all black which brought out his pale skin.  Perhaps his most dominate feature, however, was his bright red eyes that always shined with a demonical light, making him even more sinister looking.  His voice was not too deep, his colleagues said it was more spritish.  Thomas hacked violently, trying to catch a breath even though it was impossible with the pressure that the evil wizard was putting on his neck.  "Don't ever doubt my magic," Saltar said slowly while squeezing harder and harder with every word.  He got a look of disgust on his face and dropped the sheriff on the floor in a gasping, wretching heap.  Hood's face was like a huge face beet from the lack of air he had suffered.  "Humans, so fragile," Saltar commented as he kicked the sheriff hard in the side.  Hood coughed, spattering some blood from his mouth.  "Do not forget who is in control here.  Without me, you'd be nothing more than a simple peasant," the sorcerer stated angrily.  Hood didn't respond, too scared to.  "I'll go check on our guest."

						   ***  About two hours after he had started on the arrest records, Hood was still scrawling on the paper.  This should have really only taken him a few minutes, but, of course, he hadn't recieved the best education.  Perhaps he should just hire someone to write these damned things.  "Why waste your time writing those stupid things?" a dark and sadistic sounding voice sounded from behind him.  "You know the deal.  She will be erased from all memory soon enough."  "This is just in case your little hex don't work.  Never trusted those damn things."

						   "You'll soon find out.  You, however, need to have more caution."  The stranger unraveled the  wrappings from his face and ruffled his short cropped hair.  "You won't be able to save Andolin if you're caught as well."  "Andolin was caught," he rose to his feet and swiped off the dirt, "by who?  The sheriff here's an idiot."  "Believe it or not, it was the sheriff.  However, he wasn't using normal tactics."  "Huh...?"  Briar didn't get the hidden meaning.  "He used dark magic, a very powerful type."  "Okay, now I know you're lying.  Hood couldn't cast a spell let alone a line."  "I would have said the same thing, if I was just a human by-stander, but I'm an elf with a keen eye for magic. He was muttering a curse under his breath."  "Why am I listening to this crap?  I don't know you, nor do I care to know you.  I'll be going now."  He started walking out of the alley, but was stopped by a blonde female.  "Don't you want to save your friend?  I know Pathen does," she said.  The first thing Briar noticed about this girl was that she was not an elf, but a human.  She had golden hair that hung tied behind her ears.  "Who are you and why are you in my way?"  "I'm Kiri, Pathen's partner."  "Who's Pathen?"  "You were just talking to him," she gave a general gesture to the direction of the Westerner.  "Why are you two so interested in my partner?"  "He has his personal reason, don't you Pathen?  I don't really know, but I'll go along."  "Personal reason, what did she take something from you and you want your own revenge?"  Briar sneered.  "She's my fiance,"  Pathen responded frankly.  "Andolin's got a fiance?!" Briar yelled.  "Yes."  "She never told me," he pointed out.  "Our engagement isn't in the approval of The Guild.  That is the only reason she is your accomplice," Andy's fiance responed.  "Now you've got my attention.  So, how are we supposed to save her."

						   "So this is the great dragon summoner; captured by a pathetic old man living on borrowed time, sitting, waiting her sentence.  How could such a powerful elf such as yourself allow this to happen?" the owner of the footsteps mocked.    "Well, stranger, perhaps you shouldn't be talking, if you had to rely on 'a pathetic old man living on borrowed time' to capture me," Andolin paused to smile.  "I can sense your prowess.  You're aura is so dark; why didn't you use that awesome power to capture me yourself?"  "You are a sly one, aren't you?  Then again, your whole family is like that, Dragonrider."  "As if you even know my family," Andolin commented bitterly.  "Your whole clan was slaughtered, except you.  They had power to control dragons, but a dragon wouldn't even let you come within a five meter radius of it.  Your mother's last words were, "Don't forget your lineage," which she uttered while you were trying your best to save the last member of your family.  "What a sad ending to such an exciting story."  Andolin stood and walked over to the bars.  "How do you know that, wizard?" she asked with a slight hint of anger seeping through.  "Your mother died in the depths of the forest, did she not?  Trees rarely forget such morbid occasions, especially when a maiden as fair as yourself is crying."  Andolin's face paled slightly.  How could this wizard know?  They were alone when her mother's life energy faded.  Andolin sunk down to her knees.  "Brings back memories, doesn't it?"  "No!  I won't believe you!"  Andolin covered her head, trying feebly to block the sorcerer's voice.  "Lost your confidence?  Most do in the face of Death."  "I'm not dying!" the elf screamed.  "Not yet, but once I drain you of your soul, your life energy, than you will only wish for Death.  You will always see the Reaper close to you, but far away, hungry for a soul.  You will have immortality, but you will be a shell."  Andolin shook violently.

						   "I do so enjoy seeing an elf squirm," Saltar commented. He ascended the stone steps with a wicked grin on his lips.   Andolin remained in a crunched up position. Voices from memories echoed through her head; a wizard's trick.   The door clicked shut and agonizing screams echoed down from the upper part of the building.   ***   "Hey! Pathen! Why are we heading out of town if Andy's being held in the prison?" Briar asked haughtily.   "There's a dark aura surrounding the entire building. I fear the sorcerer has already taken control," Pathen responded in a soft voice.   "Uh... Which sorcerer are we talking about?"   "Saltar."   "That's a stupid name," he commented.   "Well, Briar is kind of girlish. Luckily we don't judge by names," Kiri said cheerily.   "Hey! My name's not girlish!"   "It isn't?" Kiri teased.   Pathen shook his head.  Andolin, I hope you're alright. I can't even laugh at simple things knowing you're in danger.  He clutched his heart; the pain was great.

       Baka:&nbsp; You guys sick of me yet?&nbsp; Well, you pretty much know the drill, so I don't have to repeat myself.&nbsp; But I will.    &nbsp;  Don't copy anyone's work.&nbsp; It is wrong and illegal.    &nbsp;  ***  &nbsp; Kurama stalked through the forest angrily. Why did Kuwabara have to wave his spirit sword around like an imbecile?   He continued through the woods.   Suddenly a huge, ugly, monstrous demon walked through. The other demon looked as though he was pieced together from the parts of other demons. It had ugly bluish-gray skin and sickly yellow hair. The demon had a small horn on its head. Small, white, feathered wings were barely visible over its gigantic shoulders. Its finger and toe nails were green and yellow and all jagged. Kurama didn't even want to dwell on its swelled, bulbous face.   "Show me to the nearest human flesh depository and I will devour you quickly and not so painfully," it roared.   Kurama took the rose tucked behind his ear and it immediately turned into the long, green, thorny, and elegant Rose Whip.   Suddenly, there was a streak of red glowing energy that pierced the demons ugly face. The grotesque demon exploded in a bright white light and was disintegrated.   After the carnage had cleared he looked up into the trees to see a demon holding a bow made entirely out of red demon energy. She had dark brown hair that was split into two short braids that hung just a bit below her shoulder line and two black tails tipped with white could be seen swishing behind her. She had black cat-like ears with a magenta interior and blue glasses over her deep brown eyes. The demon wore a hooded sweatshirt that was ragged and too large for her. It had gray sleeves attached to the maroon body with two gray dragons flanking a yin-yang sign a little bit under the neck. She also wore tattered blue jeans and blue and white tenis shoes that were on their last legs.   She jumped from her branch and landed shakily on the ground, lacking the grace that normally accompanied demons of her nature, but on her feet.   "That's the second one I've had to kill today. Name's Baka, by the way," she said in a clear alto voice. "And you are?"   "Kurama," Kurama responded.   "You know, you have the same name as that famous, dead thief, Yoko Kurama," she pointed out.   "He's not dead. I am him."   "But he had white hair."   "I had to escape into the human world."   "Oh, I feel stupid now."   "That's not surprising."   "What's that s'pose to mean?" she asked angrily.   "Your name is Baka..." He never finished his sentence. Baka hit him over the head. "Hey!"   "No one makes puns on my name," Baka warned.

      ***  After the fire incident they had set out again.  "Why are we walking around aimlessly anyway?" Baka asked as she bandaged her poor tail.  They all turned to her with looks that said, "That's the smartest thing we've heard you say so far, but we have no idea.  This is just how The Creators want this story to go."  "Okay, I get the point, you guys are as clueless as I am," Baka pointed out.  "I don't think we're as stupid as you," Kuwabara commented.  "Oi, Numbskull, who's the one who got a  seven  one a  multiple choice test ?" Baka snapped back.  "Geh!  How do you know about that!?" he shouted at the bitailed demon.  "I'll never tell," she responded in a eerie sing-song voice as she shook her finger slowly like a metronome in front of Kuwabara's square face.  Baka walked on ahead of him.  Kuwabara stuffed his hands in his pockets and with a slouch of his shoulders he mumbled, "Creepy little prick."  "I heard that."  Suddenly a woman with light blue hair and a pink kimono flying on an oar landed in front of the group.  "Yusuke," she said in an annoying British accent.  "Oh, who are you?"  "I'm Baka."  "I'm Hito."  "And we're demons who are presently helping these idiots out," Baka said.  "Speak for yourself," Kuwabara commented under his breath.  "I heard that."  "Gyy!"  "Alright.  Well, anyway, Yusuke, an extremely powerful demon is heading towards Mushiori City.  He's going to kill everyone and devour them."  "Let me guess, Botan, Koenma wants me to kill him off, right?"  "Bingo!" Botan responded cheerily.  ***  They came to a point directly in the demon's path, weapons ready.  Every foot step the demon took, he shook the ground.  The demon was huge, but even that would be an understatement.  They had to tilt their heads all the way back to see the guys face.  All of them attacked at once.  Kurama wielding his signature Rose Whip, Hiei with his katana, Kuwabara with the spirit sword (*cough* lightsaber rip off *cough*), while Yusuke, Baka, and Hito used their projectile attacks.  None of them worked, he swatted them away with a simple motion of his hand.  "You can't defeat me with those pathetic attacks, you fools."  "Gah!  Bad breath!" Baka stated as she covered her sensitive nose.  With his abnormally large hand, the demon swept them all away, sending them into trees.  "Damn!" Hiei spat as he picked himself off the ground.  "Such insanely strong power!  How will we defeat him?" Kuwabara paniced.  "Drama prince.  This calls for my infamous tear-jerking jaw-breaker."  Baka pulled a fist-sized red orb out of thin air.  "What the hell is that?" Hiei asked.  "I just told you.  This is guaranteed to cause instant paralysis to whoever eats it."  She walked up to the large demon, only about the height of the demon's big toe.  "Hey, mister big, powerful demon dude.  Um, I've got something you might want to try," she shouted up to him.  The demon looked down.  "What is it?"  "Just a really tastey piece of human food."  "Fine."   What an idiot.   Baka climbed nimbly up a tree till she was eyelevel with the demon.  She handed him the small orb and he popped it in his mouth.  Almost instantly he froze up.  "Now!" she shouted.  Hiei took this opportunity.  He sliced through the demon like he was soft butter.  The demon disappeared instantly.  After Hiei and Baka had reached the ground, Yusuke asked, "What did you put in those?!"  "Special secret recipe."

         After at least another good hour, Hito finally awoke, she stood stretching for a moment then sat again her legs cross as her eyes then seemed to reflect a fire that wasn't there. Baka awoke as Hito began her meditation, She looked at the flamed eyes that were compleatly detached from everything around. Then teh tip of one of Baka's tails sparked and set on fire.      "AAAAAAH! Ow ow ow!" Baka yelled putting the fire out quickly.      "How'd ya think that could've happened?" Kuwabara asked watching Baka nurse her crispy tail      "I wish I could say, the fire died a long time ago" Kurama said as confused as everyone.      An evil smile crossed Hito's lips as the dead fire began to crackle again. They all looked at her irritated as Kurama hit her in the head knocking her out of meditation but still smiling and laughing as she said innocently,      "What? I didn't do anything!" She sat up as Yuske walked up and muttered      "So, You mean to say we spent an hour getting a fire started when you're a walking LIGHTER?!?!"     She thought for a moment blinking rapidly as she then cheerfully spouted, "Yep-a yep-a!"     Yuske then hit her in the head as well, followed by a kick from Baka. Hiei simply raised an eyebrow as the beating commenced, Kuwabara asked confused,      "So you can like, Create fire and stuff?"      Hito looked at him irritated rubbing her head, "No Numb-Nuts, I create sparkly little fariys that explode in beautiful patterns bringing joy to all of the children of the world!"      "when did you learn how to do that?" Baka asked her tilting her head      Hito tripped her with a swift sweep of her leg as she stood poking the fire with a stick the end of the stick lighting as she then stared at the flame it thenk forming the shape of a small cat.     "Owie!" baka Cried then seeing the shaped flame marvled, "Ooooh! Kitty!"      The flame froze and shaped into a ruby as Hito tossed it into the air kicking it quickly as baka yelled     "NOOOOOOO! Poor kitty..." as the sparkling shards fell to the ground

      Baka, sniffing in the air, responded, "Are your other guys two humans who use extreme amounts of hair gel?"  "Yes."  Kurama turned to the slightly shorter demon, "You can tell that just by smelling the air?"  "What I lack in sight, I make up for in hearing and smell.  I have to admit, you guys have the oddest combination of smells."  "How do you mean?"  Hiei asked.  "For instance, you smell like blood and death, Kurama, here, smells like plants, Hito, for some reason, smells like fries, and your friends, that happen to be lost about a mile that-a-way," she pointed to the left, "smell clearly of hair gel."  "Yep, that's Baka.  She'd be able to smell the smallest molecule of scent from two miles off," Hito commented.  Baka grinned with pride, and her two tails twitched wildly with amour-propre (Don't ask the translation, just know it's a synonym for pride).  "That's right, besterest buddy."  They then set off in the direction of the others and met up with them.  After they had all had another chorus of laughter at Baka's namesake they set up camp, which was them propped up against trees or sprawled on the ground (By the way, that was only Baka, because she enjoys fighting the darkness, not that she knows she's doing it).  ***  Finally, after a long night of crickets chirping, the sun began filtering through the trees, waking the birds of various natures.  One, singing particularly  beautifully , was very close to where the six where still fast asleep, Baka in a completely different position from two minutes ago.  Everyone was starting to wake up, with the exceptions of Baka and Hito who were becoming increasingly annoyed.  Suddenly an arrow and a blast of red energy pierced the bird, and it exploded with a final croaking noise.  Hito and Baka were on their feet, but obviously only half awake.  The crossbow was in Hito's hands while the spirit bow faded quickly from Baka's.  "I hate birds," they mumbled simultaneously.  They then collasped on the ground completely asleep.  "What strange demons," Kurama commented.  The others agreed heartilly.

      "waaaaaait!" Hito said standing thinking for a moment, "Did you go to 'The High School for Demonic Creatures and Various Other Creatures not Able to be Classified as Humans, Tokyo Branch?"  "Yep yep!!" Baka said cheerily, "And my bestest friend went there to Saki-"  Hito covered her mouth shaking her head depressed, "I don't go by that name anymore, I dropped that name...125 years ago. don't ask"  "Saki!! IT'S REEEEEEEEEALLY YOU?" Baka said praticly jumping up and down  "DON'T CALL ME SAKI!! and yeah, It's me" she said dropping her head as baka hugged her Hito tapping her arm  "What is it my Best-y-est Friend?' She asked smiling  "air!" Hito said weakly   Hiei walked up to Hito as Baka released her, "You went to high school?"  "Yep, in college i majored in pyrotecnichs and explosives and weapons I miss those days."  "The good old days when we worshiped Baccius...how i miss them. I'll be fine" Baka said mock holding back tears  "Baccius, Who's Baccius, you?" Kurama said pointing to Baka  "No!! Baccius is the Greek god of Drunkeness and WILD PARTYING!!" Hito said excited, then quickly returning the nearly emotionless normal state  "we should really try and find the others, it's getting dark. We need to set up a camp or something" Hiei said, turning and dissapearing  "What's going on?" Baka asked as Hiei dissapeared  "The rest of our group, a few friends of ours. He's right we should try to find them. Keep your eyes out for anything." Kurama said walking on down the path the two odd demons catching up with him quickly.

      "Cool," Baka said like a wide-eyed child playing a friends awesome new game system.  "My name's Baka."  Everyone began laughing in their own way.  Kurama was politely snickering, trying to cover it with his hand while Hito flat out laughed her head off, and Hiei just raised his eyebrow with the always angry expression.  (Hey, that's as close to laughing that you can get from the shadow apparition.)  "Why is it always a pun?!" Baka shouted furiously.  "Maybe...," Hito stopped to try and catch her breath, but it was a hopeless cause, "maybe it's because your name is Idiot!"  Another round of laughter pierced the normal serene silence of the forest.  "My name is not Idiot!  It's Baka!"   "Same difference!" Hito continued to laugh.  "Errr..."  Baka shook her tight-clenched fist.  "Don't take it personally, Baka.  It's just you have to admit that it is pretty funny," Kurama tried as a comforting remark.  "Jeez...  That makes me feel a whole lot better," she rolled her eyes with the sarcastic remark.  She then hit Kurama in the head, followed by Hito, with a fan that just seemed to appear out of thin air.  "Ow!" they said together.  "I'm feelin' better now," Baka commented with a satisfied smile on her face while she gave them all the peace sign.  "Where'd that come from?" Hito asked, rubbing her head where Baka had wacked her.  "I'll never tell," Baka responded in an eerie sing-song voice.

      The girl then followed the path of where the large demon had recently passed. The demon in black jumped down, the white in his spiked hair standing out, he drew his word and prepared to attack. She stopped as his sword was nearing her head, one of her katanas hovered over her eyes as she turned to face her assailant. But all she saw was a black blur, she held her sword ready as she walked on slowly. Hiei was crouching on a tree branch watching this girl curiously. Her walk was slow and paced, she came to the path where Baka stood with Kurama. Hiei made his attack as she turned to look at the path she had just walked on. her sword just blocked his but her still knocked her down. She dragged on the harsh path for a moment before standing, her long black finger nails that looked like they had been sharpened into points, wrapped around the hilt of her sword as she poised for the next attack. Baka and Kurama watched as the two headed off on another attack.   The Girl held her ground as Hiei again became a blur, she looked around the leaned back her sword shielding her heart, Hiei knocked the word from her hand, she performed a quick back flip and stood, She froze hearing the voice of Kurama, her other katana half out of it's sheath.  "Stop NOW!" he said sternly as she looked out of the corner of her eye at him  "Oh! COME on!!!" her sword slid back into the sheath, "You're like the annoying older brother I never wanted but got ANYWAY!"  Kurama walked up to her hitting her in the head, "None of that anger now...Sak...saki, How do you pronounce your name?"  "The human and demonic tongues could never properly pronounce my name for the fact that it takes at least 20 years, starting from birth, to even grasp the simple pronunciation of the language of my home...Call me Hitogoroshi, Or Hito actually" she smiled picking up and sheathing her sword  "Doesn't that mean Murderer?" Baka asked curiously  "yup..." Hito said smiling

      "DAMN IT!", a girl yelled out walking through the dark forest mumbling, "I don't get paid enough for this, HONESTLY. I'm their best assassin and they send me to kill some high ranking demon!I want to slaughter entire villages not singular demons...Damn it all."  She was seen through a break in the light, long black hair streaked with bright blue, she wore knee high combat boots and a short black kilt that met an inch above her knee. She had on a long black cloak with a few odd symbols on the back embroidered in metallic blood red thread. She had on a black tee-shirt with the word 'FUCT' imprinted on it. Her left ear was pierced 5 times, her right ear 6 times, when she yawned a black 10 gauge barbell ran through her tongue. She had two swords strapped to her back forming an X, in the center of the X was a crossbow. Two katanas lay sheathed on her seat-belt buckle style belt. Her eyes were a deep blood red mixed with a hint of silver, when she raised her right arm to brush back her hair, a tattoo of a scythe on a chain wrapped around her forearm. She stopped and watched the "puzzle" demon cross her path she raised an eyebrow but continued on. Not noticing the demon in all black that sat on a tree watching her.  "If I get this done in the next 8 hours I get triple payout! YES!" she laughed as the castle in the distance loomed like and evil symbol.

						     Baka:  I think I'm going to rid myself of that whole "If wishes were fishes we'd all cast nets" thing.  I don't really like it.          Hey, I'm writing a new story that involves Baka's homies and a camera.  Let's just say it's going to be fun.

						    Baka:&nbsp; I posed this question to myself just before I fell into a deep sleep and dreamed about giant spiders from space attacking Earth, how is Dais fifteen in the human world?    &nbsp;  Well, first, I figured that maybe a demon year was shorter than a human year.&nbsp; That was immediately shunned due to the fact that I don't know how Yoshihiro Togashi thinks.    &nbsp;  Then I figured that maybe she came into the human world just recently, but I didn't think that would leave much room for a plot.    &nbsp;  Finally, I thought, "Hey, I don't need to change Dais!&nbsp; I can change her mother."    &nbsp;  So, I decided that her mother had died centuries before Dais came to the human world and was reincarnated in the human world.    &nbsp;  Then, it kind of takes on a Suichi Minamino story.    &nbsp;  *winks*    &nbsp;  Kurama:&nbsp; That's a creative way of fixing the problem.    &nbsp;  Were you really dreaming of giant, space spiders?    &nbsp;  Baka:&nbsp; Ha... *scratches back of head*

						     I saw "The Village" by M. Night Shyamalan.  OMG!  It was so awesome!          It also inspired me to do something different with Dai.          She's going to be completely blind, but she can see a color that represents Kurama.          Kinda like Ivy Walker and Joaquin Phoenix's character who's name escapes me as of yet.          I'm also thinking that she enters these woods that are full of demons.          I hope M. Night Shyamalan won't be upset that I'm kinda taking his idea.          If M. Night Shyamalan is reading this then I sincerely apologize and I think your name is really kick ass.          I'm just going to say it for kicks; M. Night Shyamalan.

       (Baka and Yusuke, deciding to do a little spy work, are watching Dais and Kurama on what was supposed to be a secret date)      (Dais and Kurama are sitting side by side in a booth)      Baka: I never thought I would live to see the day that Dais would wear a skirt. She looks pretty spiffy, but not as good as Kurama and that tux.      Yusuke: I think she should wear a skirt more often. She wouldn't be mistaken for a guy.      Baka: That's cold, dude.      Yusuke: It's true though.      Baka: Shhh... They're talking.      Dais: I'm never wearing a skirt again.      Kurama: I think you look nice, though.      Dais: You and about half the other guys on dates here. (Dais gestures in the general direction of someone behind her)      (Baka turns the camera to the guy)      (Noticing the angered look of his girlfriend he focuses on the girl's face and tries extremely hard to not stare at Dais)      Baka: That dudes busted.      Yusuke: Shoot, if Keiko found me starring at another girl she would knock me out.      Baka: Why am I the only one without a date?      Yusuke: Maybe you should start looking for other girls.      Baka: I'll kill you later.      Dais: We're being watched.      (Baka nearly drops camera)      Baka: Oh crap!      (Baka catches camera before it hits the floor)      Kurama: Just ignore them.      Dais: I plan to.      Kurama: Good.      (Kurama places his arm over Dais' shoulder and pulls her in close)      Kurama: Besides there is always that embarassing footage of Baka sleep-talking.      Baka: What's he talking about?      Yusuke: Uh... I...I don't know.      (Baka puts the camera on the ledge of the window facing her and Urameshi)      (She grabs Yusuke by the collar with both hands)      Baka:  Tell me!      Yusuke:  Ah!  Let me go!      Baka:  Tell me!      Some random person who walks out to smoke who is also off screen:  Hey!  What are you two kids doing out here!?

Cinni:  Well, about a year ago Baka invited Scrubby and me to a sleepover.  She made us watch a lot of scifi movies.  Finally we all got to sleep, only to be awakened by Baka shouting in a different language.      At first we thought she had been possessed by another demon, but as it turns out she was yelling in Spanish.      Kurama:  She does this every night?      Cinni:  Most.      (Yusuke enters)      Yusuke:  What's going on?      Kurama:  It seems Baka can speak Spanish in her sleep.      Baka:  Los monos atacan!      Kurama:  The monkeys are attacking!?      Yusuke:  Since when can you understand Spanish?      Kurama:  I took lessons.      Baka:  M√°telos!  M√°telos!      Kurama:  Kill them.  Kill them.      Baka:  Soy la morsa!

Kurama:  Ground control to Major Tom?      Cinni;  Baka hates The Beatles, wonder why she's saying that.      Kurama:  I'm asking myself the same question.      Baka:  Los monos mascan en la pierna!      Kurama:  We're back to the monkeys.  She sais the monkeys are chewing on her leg.      Yusuke:  That's wierd.      Kurama:  I agree.

Baka:  What have you been smoking?  It's pointed at my feet.      Cinni:  Those are some nice shoes, Baka.      Baka:  You're high on something, give the camera to Kurama.      Cinni:  No!

(Who is, by the way, my cousin)          ***          Name:  Daisuko Tokenkura   OKA:  Dais or Dai (pronounced like dice or die)  Gender:  Female  Human Age:  15 years  Demon Age:  300+  Hair Color:  Brown with red bangs  Eye Color:  Brown  Weapons:  A modified staff, fire manipulation, a Smith & Wesson M10, and incantations  Normal Personality:  Frank, calm, logical, and rational ***    Baka: Hmmm... Dais is also going to be blind except for the fact that she can see a color that represents Kurama.          Kurama: She never told me what that color was. Baka, you're the author, why don't you tell me.          Baka: If she hasn't told you then she doesn't want you to know.          Kurama: But you created this whole scenario.          Baka: *eerie singsong voice* I'll never tell.          Kurama: Is it embarrasing or something?          Baka: Not gonna tell.

        Baka: Howdy sports fans! I have decided to write a brand new fiction.          Disclaimer: Eh hem.          Baka: Right... This is my not so good friend, Disclaimer. I'm supposed to tell you something, but because I live in my own world and stuff we had to invite that thing.          Disclaimer: Very funny, Baka.          *pulls out scroll* Baka has asked this to be unprofessional so she wrote this herself.          Baka: Blah blah, yadda yadda, can we just get on with this?          Disclaimer: Quote: I do not own Yu-Yu Hakusho, that honor belongs to Yoshihiro Togashi. The only character that is mine is Daisuko Tokenkura and her parents and her enemies. End quote.          Baka: Are you done?          Disclaimer: Yes.          Baka: Good! Now get the hell outta here! *kicks Disclaimer out of door*          Kurama: Was that really necessary?          Baka: You all know my faithful sidekick. One of the four Spirit Detectives and reformed demon thief, Kurama!          *Kurama raises eyebrow*          Baka: Anyway, this story is kinda romantic, and very kick-ass. You are going to like this.          ***

       Baka:  This is actually a prologue, but it's taken from the main story. I just thought it would be spiffy if I put it in the prologue.    Kinda like  The X-Wing Series.      ***    A  loud, raspy scream reached Sabina's ears. She continued to run, sensing the gaseous blackness that was nipping at her heels.  She ran into an empty room. There was no way to escape now.  Sabina turned and pressed her back against the wall as the shadow spread into the room. Through the vapor-like darkness, emerged a young man dressed in a black cloak and black suit.  A freezing feeling descended upon Sabina and her blood started running cold.  She sank to the floor.  By some ancient instinct, she reached up to her grandfather's coin hanging around her neck and clutched it tightly.  She closed her eyes against the figure. Her heart was now pounding in her ears.  Sabina was about to pass out.  All of the sudden what seemed like a miniature tornado blew into the small compact area.  It was quick to subside.  Out of shear curiosity, Sabina opened her eyes and was shocked by what she saw.  Someone else had appeared.  He was standing protectively in front of Sabina, a small dagger clutched in his hand.  "Stay away from her, " he commanded.  The other glared angrily at this new person and disappeared.  Sabina's rescuer turned and knelt down beside her.  He was very handsome.  He looked to be about her age except he had short white hair. His eyes were a stormy grayish-blue and shown with gentle worry.  "Are you alright?" he asked Sabina.  "Y...Yes," she stuttered, still in shock from the sudden appearance. "Um... Excuse me for asking, but who are you?"  He looked confused for a second. "You don't know who I am?"  "No," Sabina responded.  He reached out and touched the coin. "Yet you called me," he stated as if he was in a trance.  "What?"  Taking his hand from the necklace, he said, "I am Drake, a wind spirit."  He smiled at her and she felt safe.

      SARAH:   You consider it dishonorable to attack enemies from the back, and yet you don't consider it dishonorable to manipulate someone else's mind? What kind of person are you? I suppose you already answered that.   Your hobbies include stealing and fighting? That's it? Don't you have anything better to do? Can't you browse the internet for something more... fulfilling... than that?

        USER PROFILE    Hello, I'm Kuronue.  A strange sadistic demon from Kurama's controversial past who is actually kind of gothic.  I have bat wings and wear mostly black clothes.  Like I said, I'm from Kurama's past.  In fact, I was his partner before I met a terrible fate while fleeing from the Castle of the Demon World.  My hobbies are stealing and fighting.  I use scythe and a pendant that I never cast away to manipulate my opponent's mind and make them believe whatever I wish them to believe.  Of course, I also just use the scythe.  And just to diminish any worries, I don't attack enemies from the rear.  It's very dishonorable.

        USER PROFILE    NAME: Sarah Anderson  I'm a twenty-five year old gal living in Colorado Springs. I have a black husky mix named Imperial Trainee Theodore Houndini Anderson. (He's as sweet a dog as anyone's ever had!)  Let's see... My job... I find people elligible to undergo a procedure to cure cancer and other terminal illnesses. It's really pretty exciting. I've actually had a couple people say no to it before. I don't really have many hobbies. I mostly just hang out around my house when I'm not working, play with Garshie, help my friend's son with his homework, etc. Sometimes I'll meet some friends at O'Malleys for lunch or dinner, but that's about it.

        USER PROFILE    Well, howdy, campers. I'm Colonel Jack O'Neill, but Reeses already knew that. My job involves lots of things that...well, I'd have to kill you if I told you about them, and I'm sure Batman wouldn't take that too well...  As for hobbies: fishing. When I'm not doing that, it's annoying Danny, pestering Carter, or teaching Teal'c the idiosyncracies of the American language. Wonder if snake baiting counts...eh, the  other  kind of snake; nothing personal, Reeses.

      SARAH:  I wouldn't be so certain, Captain Sparrow. I'm sure that, given the right circumstances, you could die just as many times as Jack. And as he and the rest of my friends from that... company... would tell you, it really doesn't matter in what manner you die as long as there's... a certain piece of technology... nearby.  Sorry, it's just seemed that way, what with the baka and rum and "snake head" discussions and all.  Yeah, I'll try to convince her of that! Wait, you're from, what, the 1800's? And you know about different kinds of peanut butter?  Ah, yes, dark chocolate. The best food-like substance in the world! Too bad it's so expensive. Now, I won't take you up on any offer of rum, but if you're going to be handing out some of that "fine Caribbean dark chocolate", I'll be more than happy to lighten your load of that!  Nah, I'd rather that they were fully conscious and understand exactly how we're gonna cure them. (Though I have to admit, drunk or not, it's hilarious to see their faces when we tell them!)

      CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  Well, unlike you, I can only live once and die once.  Im not afraid to die, love, but I would rather be killed doing something worth while than to be publicly exicuted.  Its to much publicity and i dont like crowds.  Plus if i have to hear my charges over and over again they could at least get my Rank right, savvy?  I have absolutely no negativity, and have not held a grudge since before i killed Barbossa, mate.    Peanut Butter is not even in the same catagory as Rum or Chocolate.  Peanut Butter is like eating sand, so corse and grainy unless you eat the crunchy kind.  Now, I have to say that sitting on the Pearl with a bottle of rum and some nice carribean chocolate is the best way to spend an afternoon at sea, savvy?  I prefer dark chocolate myself, it is a tad bitter, mate. I dont know... make them so drunk that they are oblivious to what they are going through?  Welcome Ava, at least someone around here thinks that Rum sounds good, in fact i shall go and endulge in some minor rum drinking, wouldnt want to be too drunk tommorrow Im sure.  Gooday, mates!

      SARAH:  Welcome, Ava. If you haven't had time to get caught up, others here include Kuronue (some anime), Colonel Jack O'Neill (Stargate), Captain Jack(three extra characters here) Sparrow (POTC), and me, Sarah Anderson (Stargate fanficdom).  A noose? A noose?! Hah! You're afraid of dying once! When I go on "buisiness trips", I have to worry about dying several times, which the good colonel here can attest to.  Okay, thanks for that understanding, captain. I suppose we could get to a point without so much negativity between us.  Lemme point somethin' out, Cpt. Sparrow: I was interpreting someone else's message to Jack. And, by the way, she says peanut butter's better than rum, beer, or chocolate. ...Humph. Now, how could any alcoholic beverage   help   with "the whole cancer thing"?

      CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  ( Very calmly) I may not know what it is to be critised and judged because of my anatomy, love but try living your life in fear of a noose.  Nobody understands a pirates mind, most are not just mindless people who go stealing things and killing people.  Did You hear about when i sacked Nassasu Port without even firing a shot.  I did that to avoid casualties, mate.  Also, Im not like Barbossa, savvy.  He got what he want by killing.  Did you know that the cannons on my ship, when i was captain, were not used at all on ports but on the daily firieng against another pirate ship to see which where more powerful nines (usually wagered on a case of rum).  And, love, im sorry about the "baka" comment i realize it is that same as me saying "savvy".  (still calm but with a little more force) Never insult my rum, telling someone not to try rum is...is...blashphamy.  If CJ wants to try it, than he sure can, love.  Also, ever think that it could help with the whole cancer thing????

      SARAH:  Just get over it, huh, Sparrow? How do I "just get over it"? I find it extremely insulting. I bet you don't even know what it's like to be criticized and judged just based on your anatomy,   sir.   I like "baka." Besides, Mr. K understands it better; it's his own language.  *Visions of drunk demons dancing in her head...*    Humans are indeed confusing, but I would like to point out that they're not impossible to live with.    Jack, you up for keeping to your beer and not touching rum? Miss V says that beer is bad enough (for you), but rum sounds to be even worse.

      CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  Kuronue, what kind of demon are you exactly? Also mate, exactly how much rum would you be needin.  The first  Sparrow Anger teatment  is to get the smell of rum so that you do not get sick.  I've had expiriance with Demons and rum before and, lets just say, it dosent sit well, savvy?  That Inuyasha couldnt stand the taste of it let alone the smell so "he settled for no less than total abstanence from the demon rum".  I say "demon rum" because of the effect it had on him.  If, demon-boy, you do not believe that i have met Inuyasha   you can go on Fanfiction.net and find the story called Pirates of the Carribean meets Inuyasha where  i am writing my adventures with this half-demon-dog-boy, savvy?  CJ, beer is  one  of the alcohalic agents in rum.  you also have the whiskey, burbon, and the vodca.  Your a military man no doubt, defenatly not a pirate because our rankings only go up to captain, but you should be able to handle some fine carribean rum.  And if you can't, mate, its pathetic, it truely is.

I'm keeping that rum in mind.  I think I'm going to need a lot of it.  *mumbles* Humans are so confusing.  This is why I never left Makai.

And why must you use the term Baka, idiot will suffice.  Also, demon boy - i would love to help you work out any anger issues you have.  Which, you must have because you got angry at someone typing your name wrong, savvy? Rum works wonders!!            Well for those of you who do not know me, I am The infamous Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you forget the CAPTAIN i might just send Elizabeth Swann after you and that IS something to be afraid of, mates.   adieu, avidosay, aloha, and all those other good-by things

       I'm sorry,  Captain , but that just seems like faulty reasoning to me. God knows what you're going to do, how you're going to go, what decisions you'll make, but that shouldn't give you an excuse for bad habits. Just because He knows what's going to happen doesn't mean that's the way he wants it to be, "savvy"? (Miss V wishes me to express her skepticism in my belief in a higher power. But that's the way she was brought up to think.)   &nbsp;   Ah, yes, Anime. You know, I kinda quit paying attention to that when I found a ton of other things to think about. You know, well-being of my world, how my friends are doing (and what trouble they've gotten into lately), grades and school, etc. But, yes, I suppose I can figure what you're talking about. (Though I'm much more of a Star Wars person. Jar Jar and John Williams all the way!)   &nbsp;   C. Sparrow, I think you need to give Mr. K a rather exact definition of the word "savvy". (Remember: proper capitilization can help to convey a clear and concise meaning!)

So technicly, dying because of rum is not dying prematurly at all.  Though i would prefer a natural cause than a noose.

      High accumulation of spirit energy, huh? Never heard of it. Hey, that reminds me of something Jonas told me. Did you know that if all the energy in a banana was released at once when you ate it, you'd explode with body parts flying up to a mile apart?  Okay, so you're not a "demon" demon. Got it. Dunno anyone who'd freely admit it to me. 'Course I try to stay away from people like that. They bug me.  You know what, Captain Jack? I'd rather not die prematurely at all! I'll leave this... dimension when the good Lord's good'n'ready for me to!

      Schizophrenia? Not really. I mean, in the sense that it's two personalities in one body, I suppose so, but it's not any kind of mental disorder. Much more rewarding than that, really.  Yes, just yellow. So? Eyes can glow another color?    That to which she is referring is neither schizophrenia nor multiple personalities disorder. To reinforce her idea on this, she even researched the two; you can be sure that her analysis is correct.  As for glowing eyes, I am aware of only one chemical which can cause this, and it has a tendancy to cause the eyes to flash in a yellow or golden light. I hold no expectation that there is no other chemical with such a property.

      Kuronue:  I seriously doubt that I'm a snake-head.  From what I understand from watching it, it seems that what you are speaking of is like schizophrenia.  Also, their eyes only appear to glow yellow.

       Then maybe&nbsp;you're a snake-head as well?   &nbsp;   I'm thinking "run" is always a good option, though Miss V says that if you're really the aforementioned source of evil, by all means, "fight you guys" is the best option.   &nbsp;   I can see the immense frustration. When my eyes glow, it's not usually in the dark, mostly because I like light. Halogen lamps are the best next to pure sunlight, though I'll settle for a set of incandescent bulbs. (I think; it's been a long time since eighth grade science!) Or the light provided by computer moniters. That's always good. Ah... the wonders of e-mail! Fanfiction! Star Wars fan sites! All wondrous things to be looking at late into the night! Of course, that's not usually when my eyes glow. In fact, I think my eyes glow the least then and--   &nbsp;     I'm sorry. Sarah Anderson has become suddenly unavailable as a result of her unscreened babbling.   <>

      Kuronue:  Hey!  My eyes glow red and by many standards, I am evil!  I'm deciding whether I should run or fight you guys.  By the way, most demons' eyes glow.  Especially in the dark or during immense frustration.

      SARAH:  Hey, someone's gotta appreciate my humor, Jack, especially since I really can't let it shine in this crowd like I can around Setira. You took my meaning wrong! I was describing Kurama's gray hair, not your *eh-hem*   silver   ... locks. I was just saying that there should be an "'c" on the end of "teal". That's all.   Really, captain... Miss V has her full support behind Jack's question. She also wants to warn you about something to do with the liver. (I really was trying not to listen.)  Ooh! Yay! Shoot the glowy-eyed demon! Wait a minute! Shoot the   EVIL   glowy-eyed demon!

      Col. Jack O'Neill:  Despised; Yes. Demons; Possibly. Gods; Nope.  I'm sure that T would appreciate your humour  so  much, Reeses.  Hey, hey, hey...less of the 'old' and 'grey'. I have Daniel to blame- er, thank for that. And its silver, and distinguished i'll have you know.  Hey, Captain Jack, explain to me just how Rum helps with communication. 'Cause here i am thinking that alcohol, being a muscle relaxant and reducing co-ordination and all that crap wouldn't help. Specially somehting as strong as neat rum...i've allways found that it makes it  harder  to talk. And be understood at least.  Any place with a glowing-eyed 'demon' leader is no place i wanna be. Unless i get to shoot it.

       Grr! All well. C'est la vie, I suppose. Tell me when's a good time.    &nbsp;    &nbsp;That's exactly how I planned it, K! (I had to look up how to spell it. It was as painful as my last tetnis shot from ol' Doc Frasier!)   &nbsp;   "Demon World." Never heard of it. Does it have an address? Makai, hm? Y'all ever have a ... a ruling... demon-guy... with flashy eyes... and a weird name?

If you must know, though I am certain I have already made it clear to you where I come from, I come from a city called Makai in the Demon World.

Though I think that whole "in person" bit might be a problem. How 'bout I call you tomorrow afternoon around four?  Uh, captain, rum really wasn't involved in this conversation. It solved no problems and therefore doesn't get any credit. Tough luck.

(By the way, if you can't pronounce my name just stick with K)  You really need to understand the world that I come from to understand the referecnes that I make.  We should meet in person so then we could sit down with a nice cup of tea and discuss my past.

       SARAH:   &nbsp;   On the contrary, it kind of is brain surgery; you have to&nbsp;basically rewire or&nbsp;reprogram&nbsp;my brain to think of you as anyone other than Mr. K or just K.   &nbsp;   Oh, yeah,  all  humans would be gone. Like that could happen! Gimme a break! No one knows where  all  the galaxy's humans are. And because of that cell organization of the human race, you'll never,  never  be able to say that  anyone  could or would kill  all  humans.   &nbsp;   T-Guru? Is that the official Guru of Togo? Leader of what? You're going to have to be more specific when you say stuff like that. I don't blame him. I might kill a demon just for looking at me if he caught me in the wrong mood.    &nbsp;   "Despised demon gods"? I think I know who you're talking about. (Doesn't that sound like them to you, Jack?) Though I've never heard of any of them disguising themselves. 'Cept for Nirrti, of course, if you want to call an invisibility cloak a disguise.    &nbsp;   Koo-ra-ma? Hmm. I've got a picture of him sitting around somewhere, I think. Doesn't he wear teal ('c, right Jack?) and have gray-ish hair? Not the connotation of gray hair connected with old people, but... a...  vivacious  gray.    &nbsp;   Join forces? Excuse me, but for one, what against? I have&nbsp;some enemies&nbsp;in mind, but I probably can't tell you about them. For two, how do you know that I'd be any force to be reckoned with? After all, I basically sit around my house all day and look after my friend's son. And Garshie. Garshie's such a cute little husky!

      Kuronue:  Ker-ron-oo-ay that's how you pronounce my name.  It's not brain surgery.  I shouldn't have said most humans would be wiped out, ALL humans would be gone.  I'm sure there are a few demons that would gladly devour your souls and your bodies.  Only problem with that is that Toguro might be the leader which would be bad for everyone.  That guy would kill a demon for just looking at him.  Maybe we should just join forces after all.  I could use some allies, I just found out that one of the despised demon gods disguised himself as me and tried to kill Kurama.  (Fool)

      SARAH:  I don't know how to spell it, K, because I have to be able to say it to remember it. If I can't remember it, I can't spell it. Besides, it's more fun, messing with your mind and all.  Excuse me, but if they enslave humans, I don't think they'd "be more pathetic". Mind you, I'm not saying they're not pathetic; apparently, power and pitifulness have no correlation. I just want you to realize that you're stereotyping.   The Spirit World? Gimme a break! The "spirit world" can kiss my... Miss V's .... my ... boots!... for all I care. For one, I have a higher power working on my side that has got to make the "spirit world"'s apparent "power" look like a rubberband next to an ion cannon or a ballistic missile. For two, if most of us would be wiped out, I'd either be dead (in which case I wouldn't give a cow pattie) or ... elsewhere, where I'd work on finding a way to kick the butt of whoever did it, but I wouldn't be dead.

Of course, if the Spirit World wasn't on your side, most of you would be wiped out.  DEMONS ARE BETTER!  (My kind are at any rate)

      SARAH:  I'm sorry, but you're name's too hard to pronounce, and therefore, too hard to spell. So I suppose I can stick to K like in   MIB.    Yeah, I understand, Jack. To be truthful, she isn't all that aesthetically pleasing to me, either.  It's because those demons are too caught up in trading insults to understand the concept of sarcasm.  K, Kuronuway, whatever: You say anything like "the humans should be exterminated" one more time and... and... I'll... use my "blue Force energy" on you, causing you great pain and possibly a bit of a black-out. As Jack said, if we're so pathetic, why don't evil guys with glowing eyes rule the world?

So the next time I happen into a biology class, you can cut the fish's head off, right?  Actually, Mr. K, Miss V has been called a demon before. I'm sorry, but peanut butter has nothing on chocolate. (Miss V says it's the other way around.) Really, Mr. K, there's no reason to be   that   upset. We're all friends here, right? (Ish?)  I'm not particularly fond of either, Ava, but Miss V was commenting that peanut butter is better for you physically than rum.  Excuse me, Muiya, but I believe you and Miss V are mistaken. DARK CHOCOLATE rules over all, well, maybe just CHOCOLATE in general; there's no age limit. You can get addicted from the time you can eat.  Thank you, Jack!!! Wait, you completely lost me with the reference to techno-babble. What's that?  I don't know how the peanut butter and alcohol thing started, but I bet it has something to do with Sparrow and me.  Ooh! Behold the power of demon mothers! Hah! My demon's mother is... Okay, nevermind. She says not to go there.

Definately sticking to the beer...with the occasional Whiskey maybe.  She's right. If you ever meet anyone with an unhealthy obsession with tacky decor and delusions of power then run away. Far away.  Peanut butter and Marmite...greatest snack in this Galaxy and several others.  Ah, but Captain Jack, does it say Captain on your uniform?  Wait, don't you have some way of preventing that? Something about the brain being intact and then they cant bring you back? I'd swear Jacob said somehting about it but...i wasn't really listening. What? Carter and Danny were techno-babbling!

Well i'm about 5 6, With black, blood red, and blue hair. My hobbies are slaughter, shiny objects, trying to find a way to use my full powers without destryoing this pathetic body, training, and your good old messing with peoples heads! I carry one katana, one sakabato, a cross bow, and two .45 magnum six-shooter revolvers, and a quiver of arrows. So that be me, Oh i have an amulet of a dragon on a cord around my neck, family heirloom and is used to contain my power.

      Kuronue:  Death Print Bull's-Eyes aren't really telekinesis.  You see, the techinigue is proformed by actually marking the victims body with spirit energy and the ammunition (which can be anything from rocks to a fuel truck) follows that small ammount of spirit energy and normally hits the marks.  Unless you're like Urameshi, than you can always dodge them.

       Ooh! Telekinesis! That's what I like about zats. It's hard to stop pure energy, even if you have something like telekinesis working for you. (And it's not usually affected by gravity unless you have something on the scale of a black hole nearby.)   &nbsp;   That's about the only solution I've been working with for the past few years anyway. I guess I'll just have to stick to it. I was just hoping there's something else I could do. I've talked around the base a bit, and the best people can tell me is to go meditate. If meditation helped cure you, I can see why my health's on the abnormal side (for me, which usually just entails a sore muscle or something) with all the racket Matt added to my peaceful little home.                   -the Sorceress of Stories and Scifi         "Dogs are my favorite people." -Colonel Jack O'Neill,&nbsp; Stargate SG-1&nbsp;           		  Do you Yahoo!?

       That's a good point. Why do you think Daniel thought he could get away with it. And where were you at the time? I mean, SG-1: it's rare that y'all don't do something together.   &nbsp;   K, I wasn't asking about the dream; if I was, I'd've described it. I was asking if you had any suggestions to dull the pain, something other than time and ibuprofin, which are only so effective. (And don't tell me antacids, either; I've tried. They work less than the ibuprofin.)   &nbsp;   I bet knives will go through you when thrown from a distance when they have gravity working on their side.                   -the Sorceress of Stories and Scifi         "Dogs are my favorite people." -Colonel Jack O'Neill,&nbsp; Stargate SG-1&nbsp;           		  Do you Yahoo!?

You see, every now and then, I have this nightmare, and I wake up with my throat burning, especially when the dream's really vivid.   &nbsp;   Captain: What's a "plage"? Never heard of it. Oh, I get it, you meant "plague". That's kind of one of the benefits of good spelling: good communication.   Not worth your time? Isn't that a little harsh? To take Miss V's words, isn't she still a fellow human from  your  planet and time? I mean, you have more in common with her than you do with most of us on this blogging "IM".    		  Do you Yahoo!?

      CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  Elizabeth Swann is the plage of my life, love.  She burnt the rum, all the rum, savvy?  Any woman who does that is not worth my time.  Plus, she is mr.Turners.  Me and Miss Swann, id take torture.

      SARAH:  Oh, Captain, anyone can die multiple times. It just has to do with being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Hey, that bit of etymology is pretty interesting. Makes sense too.   Elizabeth Swann? Might it be that Captain Jack has a girlfriend? *gasp*

      CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  its nice to know that i am the only one in this bunch that can only die once. (sarcasum *drip drip*) Once again i was only comparing being hung with liver failure, savvy?  But if you wish to ask my opinion, i agree with CJ that crucifiction would be horrable and humiliating.  Did you know that the word excrutiating came from crucifiction because of the pain and agony you go through, mate?  I also agree with CJ that being torchered would not be wonderful either.  Many pirates go through that if you take hostages but i am not that ruthless.  Also the british officials, namely norington, are not smart enough to torcher pirates.  Although, mate, if elizabeth swann was a pirate hater i would never go near port royale ever again, savvy?

       Ehem. Very funny, Jack...  &nbsp; I  do it every year, not Vinnet. She just sits there and yells at me while I'm doing it, something about "bad for you" and putting down Christianity. I'll show her one day. She's so wrong about that.   &nbsp;   He did?! That's hilarious! I wish I was there to see it!   &nbsp;   K, it has nothing to do with reincarnation. It's more of a Lazarus thing, being brought back to life. Reincarnation entails also changing forms, somehow.   Well, apparently, it's fun for some, the whole making others into swiss cheese thing. Again, I shouldn't really comment, but I'm sure Jack can sympathize with you.   		  Do you Yahoo!? Friends.  Fun.  urlLink Try the all-new Yahoo! Messenger

(They want me to repent for my thievery.  That pompous little wind bag, Koenma, really knows how to irk someone.  He should go after the people who through those spears.  The one through my leg would have been enough, but no, they had to turn me into swiss cheese.)

You do that every year? You're a better man than me. Wait...a better snake...or something...  I didn't do a thing. It was Daniel. Do you think that i'd be able to reply to an Evil Snake in their own language to tell them that i'm the "Great God Oz"?  C'mon, you know me and snakes...its nothing personal.

      Col. Jack O'Neill:  Pretty good actually, thanks for asking.  Trust me, Zat's are not a 'heck of a thrill'. Try having every nerve on your body set on fire. And humiliating? A noose is nothing...ever been tortured to death? And then brought back to do it again? And again? And again? And again? And again? And again? And again? And again? And again...i lost count in the end. Knowing that you can't resist the urge to scream like a girl for much longer is humiliating...not a quick drop, probable snap of the neck before a relatively quick asphyxiation. Oh, and here's one for Reeses...well, half of her...crucifixtion. I'm irked.  That all? Where do you get the energy?  No, not the great god  of  Oz...just "The Great God Oz." Ask Daniel some time...or Jacob 'n' Selmak.  Yeah, well, it remains to be seen whether or not they like it as much as T. FOr all we know he could be a Jaffa Geek.  Yup, and if you get the Doc P.O'd then she brings out the  really  big needles.  Yeah...I'm not so sure that applies when the 'alien resides within you' as opposed to 'with you in your land'. If it did, all those creepy bugs you can get in the tropics, or Africa wouldn't make you so damned ill. And there's this one little fish that, when you're peeing...well, i think you get the point.

       Yes, rhymes. That happens some tymes. Thanks, K. See, Capt. Jack: you've got access to a computer, you've got access to at least a dozen spell-checkers. As to the spelling of "grammer," I think that's another nationality difference, same as "honour" and "color".   Actually, Jack, I've had very little chocolate today. One little serving of chocolate ice cream and that's it. Very abnormal for me. But at that point, I think I was still on my regular dose.      I must point out that there are worse ways to "go" than being hanged or being shot. Colonel O'Neill has found quite a few of them.  If anyone cares, the worst death I can think of is dehydration. Either that or acid. But I've done neither. (I would say obviously, but sometimes, that's not so obvious.)   Alright, Jack, I'm gonna have to disagree with you there. "The Great god of Oz"? Gimme a break!   Yes. All Jaffa should watch each Star Wars episode at least four times. I'll keep them company if they don't try to bite my head off first. Maybe I'll just happen not to mention that I'm a ... while around them.   Excuse me... "Counciling and medication"? I'm perfectly healthy, thank you! If I wasn't, Miss V would kindly let me know. *Miff* "Counciling and medication". Even if Miss V didn't constantly moniter my state of mind, body, and general health, I get a stinkin' physical every time I come back from a mission!    Lip piercing? May I "put in my two cents' worth"? Having a piece of metal jammed into your lip has several side effects. For one, it chips your teeth. You may possibly have to receive ceramic replacements. For two, though the social interactions among peers may improve, any respectable employer who might try to attract elderly customers would not hire someone with such a piercing.  Plus, (although I think Miss V summed it up pretty well), Leviticus 19:28: "You shall not make any gashes in your flesh for the dead or tatoo any marks upon you: I am the LORD." (It wasn't really the one I was looking for, but it's close.)   Hey, Jack (both of y'all): While I was looking for that, I came across another one I thought would be interesting for y'all to hear. Miss V likes it. Leviticus 19:33-34: "When an alien resides with you in your land, you shall not oppress the alien. (34) The alien who resides with you shall be to you as the citizen among you; you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were alines in the land of Egypt..." 'Course, that's just what it says in the NRS version.

      Kuronue:  I personally think it is better to be disintergrated by in a blast of demon energy than either of the deaths you speak of.  Then again, you will most likely end up in the same place either way.  The worst death I can think of is dying of a loss of blood.  (Stupid spears.)

      CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  Getting shot is a lot better then dying by liver falure, mate but i was only comparing the two.  Although that Zat that Sarah has mentioned befor that makes you seemingly dead would be one heck of a thrill.  A noose is just not fun, it is humiliating especcially when you are infamous, savvy?

      Col. Jack O'Neill:  Well, yeah, but this  is  Teal'c we're talking about...although he's getting *so* much better now.  Hey, Sarah, you been at the chocolate again? You sound like Carter when she see's some new peice of tech.  Explain to me exactly how dying relatively quickly by noose is better than dying the long, slow, painful way of liver failure? From my experience...a bullet in the chest is the best way to go.  Gotta say the only God i believe in is "the Great God Oz."  Has Teal'c been sneaking Star Wars DVD's into the alpha site shipments again? He seems to think that all of his Jaffa buddies should see it at least four times.  I allways thought Grammar was spelt with an a..., not an e.  Simple pleasures please simple minds... (Hey, K, d'you know your name sounds like a martial arts? Karate, Judo, Kuronue...)

       Sorry, Captain, but you seemed like such an intelligent person until we looked at your grammer and spelling. The best thing about learning a foreign language is learning how to spell "conjugation." It's a good thing to know when you speak German. (Conjugations of "sein" and all: bin, bist, ist, sind, seit, etc.) (On a similar note, I believe that they are "Eunichs,  too .")   &nbsp;   Not ready to give it up that easy, huh? Giving up anything isn't easy. Kinda reminds me of all the people I've seen that have given up their homes, jobs, and all that just in the hopes that they might get to see them again. Sounds kinda odd, doesn't it?<>

      CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  "Savvy" is the congigation of somewone who understand or comprehends, mate  A question in itself.  French, latin based of course.  Inventers of mayonaise who are also wonderfull singers and are obssessed about raisins.  Eunichs to.  As to you, Sarah, I was just stating the obvious and though it may be a bad habit i am hooked.  Being a pirate is almost as bad as execively drinking, yet, that is the way God inteded for me to live as a pirate.  So though i know the entire "your body is a temple", love, i am not ready to give up rum that easy.  And thank you Kuronue for agreeing with me.  Ah, Inuyasha... dont go there, mate! Not that i didnt like the guy, in fact you could say tha we are "friends" but you need to be away from him for a while, a long while.

Baka:  *snoring**wakes with start*  Wha...what?!  Where're the fronkeys?!  Kuronue:  Never mind.  Why are Sparrow and that other guy screaming?  Buddha:  Something about being stuck with Jen for a long time.  Kuronue:  I'd scream too.  Baka:  *looks up at Kuronue**blinks multiple times*  Uh...  Kuro!  You're back!  *goes back to sleep**mumbling*  The fronkeys...  The fronkeys are coming.  Has the jury reached a verdict?  Kuronue:  I'm afraid to ask.  Buddha:  She talks in her sleep.  Fronkeys are something she heard about from one of her favorite stand-up comedians.  I'm not sure about the strange judge thing.  Baka:  *shouts*  Fronkeys with bananas!  Yay!  *snores*  Fronkeys!  Kuronue and Buddha:  *cast confused stares at Baka*  Baka:  Fronkeys!  Kuronue:  I'm just about to leave for the demon world.  Wanna come?  Buddha:  Sure.

Kuronue:  *runs off into the distance*  Baka:  Got rid of him.  Buddha:  You were lying the whole time?  Baka:  Not the whole time.  The first four sentences are true.  Buddha:  I'll never understand demons.  Baka:  I'll never understand FLCL, but, hey, it's still awesome.  Buddha:  That doesn't sum up most demons, however.  Baka:  *picks up empty rum bottle*  Did you drink all the rest of this?  Buddha:  No.  Baka:  So, Kuronue ran off into the distance completely drunk?  Buddha:  Yeah, I guess he did.

Okay, I'll shut up.  Next few? Just in two years, I read over sixty of them. Granted that about twenty were only a hundred pages long, but still...    She cannot consider that there are other hobbies we could take up, though I must admit that some of the descriptions remind me of past experiences.     *glares* Very funny, Jack. You know as well as I do that Miss V's a separate entity.  Baka, you never answered my question. If you know what your name means, may I call you Dummkopf or Nerfherder?

What'ya suppose that means Buddha?  *hands Buddha the bottle*  Buddha:  *takes bottle*  I wouldn't know.  Sanzo's views are correct.  *takes particularly long swig*  Kuronue:  Oi!  Save some for me!  Buddha:  Sorry.  Kuronue:  S'okay.  Buddha:  But who knew that the highest priest of Buddhism was blasphemous?  And who knew a god would say that?  Kuronue:  Don't feel bad.  Buddhism is on a comeback.  Me, personally, enjoy being an atheist.  Baka:  *enters right*  Buddha, what are you doing?  Buddha and Kuronue:  Aw shaddup!  Baka:  I'm so glad I'm a Christian.  Kuronue:  Now, you're a Christian, yet you're sitting here talking to a god of a completely different religion.  Buddha:  Depends on your beliefs.  You see, she knows that I was more of an extreme follower of Allah.  I'm not really a god, but I ascended to a god-like level.  Baka:  This should be a sitcom.  Kuronue:  Hey, other people, come join the party.  Baka:  I'm out.  Kuronue:  Good riddance.  Baka:  Why I outta...  Kuronue:  Outta what?  Buddha:  Will the two of you be quiet?  Don't start fighting now.  Baka, go grab a drink for yourself and have a seat.  Kuronue:  Bring some food, too.  Baka:  Like I would bring you food.  Buddha:  Someone else can bring the food.  Baka:  *shrugs**goes and gets a carbonated drink**returns**sits down beside Kuronue*  When did we get bean bag chairs?  Kuronue:  Good question.  Lindsay:  Hello, this is just a cameo appearance from yours truly.  I would like to point out that I, like Baka, am a Christian and, while writing this whole thing, was thinking what it would be like if a Christian demon, Buddha, and an atheistic demon got together on a little chat.  This does not reflect my views on anything, and if that's what you got from this I am sorry.  So even if this has no particular plot to it, I have my own plot.  Fronkeys rock!

      Baka:  I'm a bit confused by all of this talk of burning rum and trying to save Will.  Buddha:  I have no insight into this either.  Baka:  Where's Kuro?  Buddha:  He's a bit indisposed at the moment.  Baka:  He still knocked out?  Buddha:  Yes.  Baka:  Do you think you might've hit him a bit too hard?  Buddha:  No.  Baka:  The rest of you must really hate Kuronue if you don't even comment about that sudden attack.  Buddha:  He had it coming.  Baka:  Yeah, but Gojyo is just like Kuronue and you don't do anything to him.  Buddha:  He's aiding in saving Shangri'la.  Kuronue, however, had no distinct purpose.  Kuronue:  Hey, I can hear you two!  Baka:  You're up.  Kuronue:  Yeah, yeah.  It's times like these I wish I was back in Makai.  Baka:  *sarcastically*  Oh, does poor Bat Boy want a cookie?  Kuronue:  You little bitch!  *chases Baka again*  Baka:  You'll never catch me!  Kuronue:  We'll see about that, you bastard!  Baka:  Swearing will get you nowhere.  Kuronue:  *pulls out scythe and throws*  Baka:  *too distracted by the scythe coming towards her, trips over her own feet*  Kuronue:  *stops running*  I didn't even hit her and she falls down; this is too pathetic for words.

      Jenn:  I am watching the food chanel and they are making a drink using rum, sugar, diet coke, and red wine.  Then they are taking some and thickening it with baking soda and water to use to marinate steaks.  it turns out that because rum has so much alcohal in it, the different types cancel out each other and make it tast more alcohalic withought having that much alcohal.  That is why you must drink a lot to get drunk.  Elizabeth:  So that is why jack didnt get drunk after 5 bottles of rum when we were on that island.  Jenn: exactly!  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  Please dont remind me about the Island, mates.  Jenn: the whole burning rum thing!   CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: yea.  Elizabeth: im sorry Jack but i wanted to get out and save Will  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: I understand, love  Elizabeth: Really?  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  I was able to vent on the island, im not mad it is just a scar.

      Buddha:  You don't scare me.  Baka:  Me either, but I'm a demon and Buddha's a god.  I'm only scared of youkai.  Kuronue:  Youkai are the same thing as demons.  Baka:  That may be true, but you read Saiyuki.  You saw how they acted.  Kuronue:  Please, I've done worse.  Baka and Buddha:  *large collective gasp*  Kuronue:  What?  By the way, that wasn't exactly Japanese money.  It was demon money.  Baka:  *sing-song voice*  As I've said before, Makai money no good in Tortoise.  Kuronue:  You're starting to sound like Haruhara Haruko.  Baka:  I should invite her and Atomisk over.  Kuronue and Buddha:  No!  Baka:  Would you prefer Goku?  Kuronue:  I don't want a monkey here.  Baka:  He's not such a monkey.  Kuronue:  If you're going to invite some character from Saiyuki here, make it one of those women.  Baka:  Ew!  Kuronue:  Oh, I forgot, there's a kid here.  Buddha:  You're a vile person.  Kuronue:  What's your point?  Baka and Buddha:  *stares angrily at Kuronue*  Baka:  Remember when you said you should strike Kuronue down?  Buddha:  Yes.  Baka:  Now is the time to use that divine power.  Buddha:  That would make me a hypocrite.  Kuronue:  *sarcastically*  God forbid you become a hypocrite!  Buddha:  But if I must commit an act of blasphemy to get rid of you so be it.  *ball of energy forms in hands*  Kuronue:  Now, there's no need for that.  Buddha:  *throws chi in Kuronue's direction*  Kuronue:  *dodges quickly*  Jeez, for a god you have terrible aim.  *another ball of energy hits Kuronue in the stomach*  Ai!  Baka:  That was fun.

      Jenn:  NO, i do not have a problem with legolas  Elizabeth:  Who?  Jenn:  The nice twin of Will.  Elizabeth: OH! And, Jack is just... well, Jack.  He is very smart though.  I agree he is wierd, for a pirate he is so mild mannered.  Do take in mind that i said "for a pirate".  Will is mine!  he is a blacksmith and he is sooo could looking!!  Jenn: *Cough*  Elizabeth: *glares*  I love him.  We met when we were 10.  *sigh*  And Orlando Bloom is some guy who i just slapped and is doubling over right now.  Should have slaped him with my hand in the face not my foot.  Jenn: ^_^  foot is good!  Um.. Orlando bloom is not that bad.  He said basicly on a audio interview i listened to that women were not as strong as men and that they were put on the earth for one reason.  I didnt like that, but i listened to some more that said that his idol was Johnny Depp who told him that women are strong if not stronger then men.  Then that he went on to tell bloom that he watched his wife give birth to their daughter and he almost fainted from her cutting off the circulation to his hand.   Elizabeth:  If woman arent that strong then why is he doubling over and i am not!!! HA - Evil twin of my dear sweet william!  Jenn:  yes, but Legolas and Will arent womanizers.  But true, "with any character you play there has to be a little of you inside or else it is not acting, its lying." -- Johnny Depp.  Good going Sarah!  Oh look Jack is back!! ^_^  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  ello, mates!  No time no speak.  it seems that the casher does not take Japanese money.  Oh and i know Japanese when i see it, i spent a long time with Inuyasha.  Uhem,, i wonder how i got that type of money Kuronue?!  And Sarah, love, im over it.  Why am i on your bad side?    Jenn: *singing* Why cant we be friends, why cant we be friends.  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  Shutup!  Jenn: Whatever you say.  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  She is stairing at me wierd, mates!  Elizabeth:  Gin is ok, it is not Rum so Jack will not be interested.  Im more of a white wine spritzer.  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  Ah Gin.. gin is good!  It is more mild than rum, more of a desert wine for me, love.  I have recently ecperimented in prison and adding gin to rum.  it was good, i call it Sparrow Rum!  Jenn: sorry.  it has already been invented and givin a name by me!  Gin Rummy!!! Hahahahahaha.  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  I think im gonna leave, mates.  This woman is scaring me!  Jenn:  Ha, I scare all!!! *follows Jack*  Elizabeth:  Well, im going to go save Jack! Good day.

      Baka:  I only took two courses in Spanish.  I'm going into Latin!  I do know a few words in Goa'uld, but not enough to make conversation.  In fact, I only know two to six words.  Kuronue:  I don't know any other language except Japanese and English.  For your sakes, I speak in English.  Buddha:  I know many languages.  Baka:  Hey, Sanbutsushin-san, shouldn't you be helping Genjyo Sanzo and company.  Buddha:  Good point.  *disappears*  Baka:  Good luck against Gyumaoh, and tell Sanzo he owes me one-hundred dollars for that game of oisho-kabu.  Kuronue:  Isn't this Sanzo guy a Buddhist monk?  *picks up Baka's Saiyuki graphic novel*  Strange monk.  Baka:  Hey, that's my graphic novel!  Kuronue:  *holds above head*  Come and get little one.  Baka:  Hey, only my cousins are allowed to call me little one!  *jumps up and misses*  Give it back, you jerk.  Kuronue:  Oh, I'm hurt.  This is Kuronue, signing out for Baka and Buddha.  Baka:  *jumps*  Kuronue:  *hits Baka in head*

      SARAH:  That's okay; I usually can't hold grudges very long. He's still not on my good side. In my mind, there's very little distinction between Bloom and Bloom characters. Deep down in side, they're all the same person. No one can play a character he can't agree with; you have to get in character.   Baka, good for you being a Christian! I wear Christian shirts... to other bases... all the time! It's kinda funny 'cause I'm the only one there with a t-shirt on at all, but I figure that if I might have to watch my friends die, I might as well be comfortable.   Ah, that explains that, considering I think it's roughly around 2013... I've never heard of those planets. Are they Protected Planets? Do they each have a Chaapa'ai?  Great. So someone speaks Japanese. Someone speaks Spanish. Where are the people that speak "the language of the gods", for lack of permission to use the better name? How 'bout Deutsch? Mal kat!!! Foulspeil!!!

      Church:  Year(s)? Well keep in mind I haven't been on Earth for... However long... Switching between Sidewinder and Blood Gulch... I really don't know what year it is. Seriously, if traveling to other countries on Earth causes massive jet lag, think about what traveling to other planets will do to ya'. I've lost years to jet lag... Probably. Well, I'll try to calculate it... Master Chief destroyed the Covenant Armada in 2552. It's probably somewhere around 2553-2555. But once again, massive jet lag.  Hey, Elizabeth, what's with that Jack guy? That's one weird drunk. And who's this Will person? Who's Orlando Bloom?  Hey Baka, you speak Spanish? Hablo Espa√±ol. No  s√©  Espa√±ol, pero lo hablo.

      Baka:  You even have a problem with Legolas?  But he's an awesome elf.  Buddha:  He was quite good in Lord of the Rings.  Kuronue:  I'm going to regret this, but how the hell did you see Lord of the Rings?  Buddha:  I can take many forms.  Kuronue:  What did you turn into a cat and go to the theater?  Buddha:  How dare you!  Baka:  Kuronue, do have any idea what the cat symbolizes in Buddhism?  Kuronue:  Yes.  Baka:  The cat represents evil.  Sidhartha Guitamo was one of the most pure gods.  Besides God, no one is better than God.  Kuronue:  It appears you practice two religions.  Baka:  No, I'm Christian.  I just know a lot about Buddhism, like Buddha's real name.  Kuronue:  How did Buddha get into this anyway?  Buddha:  I'm just a part of Buddha, but I'm not sure how I got into this.

      Baka:  *giggles even more feverently*  Makai money doesn't work well in Tortoise, eh?  Kuronue:  Why do you keep saying tortoise?  Baka:  Because Tortuga is Tortoise in Spanish.  Kuronue:  What is Spanish?  Baka:  You don't really know jack about normal people, do you?  Kuronue:  Just tell me.  Baka:  It's a human language.  I'm a bit off track aren't I?  Kuronue:  *sarcastically* No Baka, you're right on.  Baka:  Shut it.  I think that peanut butter and chocolate are both good, especially when bonded together to form an awesome, unhealthy, fattening snacky.  Kuronue:  Is there s'pose to be some kind of hidden meaning in there?  Baka:  Do you even know what we are talking about?  Kuronue:  Only slightly.  Baka:  All the more reason to stay out of this.  Random voice from the abyss:  And so the argument went on.  It finally ended when Baka made a rude comment about Kuronue's past life and was thrown off a building only to be caught by the waiting arms of her boyfriend,...  Baka:  Hey, don't tell the public.  That's only between you and I.  Voice:  Sorry.  It's not easy being part of the Sanbutsushin.  Baka:  I'm not familiar with that particular term.  Voice:  I am one of the three parts of the Buddha.  Baka and Kuronue together:  You're a god?!!!  Voice:  I think there is a question you have yet to answer.  *abyss closes and Buddha disappears*  Baka:  Oh yeah, YYH is the acronym for Yu-Yu Hakusho (that means ghost files or poltergeist report).  Kuronue:  Are you done yammering?  Baka:  Don't be so rude.  Kuronue:  You should really be talking.  Baka:  Hey!  You wanna piece of me!  Fine, lets see you throw me off a building again!  Kuronue:  You want to land in...  Baka:  Don't say it!  Buddha:  *peeking out from a cloud of smoke**slaps forehead*  Not again.  I ought to strike them both down, but I can't take other creatures' lives.  This is worse than the behavior of Sanzo.

      SARAH:  Wow, Church, that's horrible! I'm sure   someone   cared about you, right? Actually, no, that didn't answer my question. I've never heard of it. In what year(s) does it take place?  ...Another no comment to Baka and K. So... Baka... *evil smile* If I called you Dummkopf, you wouldn't be insulted, right? Same if I called you Nerfherder?  Actually, you get at least 90% of the information from the books. If he hasn't read them, he must not know ninety percent of it. Yup. All the more fun.  Well... I'm not much of a cake fan... How 'bout chocolate?    Bringing such a substance to a party would be incredibly insulting for some of us. I would rather not ingest any of it.    What? Like peanut butter is any better?    It is.    It's not candy! There's no sugar! It's too nutritious; it's a high source of protein! Wouldn't you rather get your serving of protein on something more expensive like ribs?    What is the point of spending a superfluous amount of money for actual meat? At our bases, we do not even have meat.    Yeah, well, enjoy it while you can! There's no point in training yourself to eat bad food when we live here most of the time.    Peanut butter is not bad food.    Neither is chocolate.    Chocolate has no nutritional value.    Peanut butter has no taste value.    It is not all about taste.    You're in America; of course it is!  Anyway... Sorry about that. But if y'all could convince her that she's wrong, I'd greatly appreciate it.  He does? Wow. I don't have many of his CDs anyway, so I don't think the video would do any good. But if I could get my hands on his song about dead puppies, that could be entertaining.  Well, Elizabeth, I'd help you get them out, but I have a particular grudge against Sparrow at the moment and my friend has a particular grudge against Turner-boy there. You're kinda on you on with that one unless anyone's feeling a bit friendlier than I am.

      Elizabeth:  Jack is in jail right now so he cant talk.  Both of us and Will were on the pearl yesterday traveling to tortuga and he tried to buy Rum.  A wierd looking form of money was in the wad of cash and they acused him of cheating them.  I tried to reason with them but they just took Will with them and kicked me out.  So to refraise, both Jack and Will are in a jail in tortuga.  At least Gibbs was there to take me home.

And then we could nail them and bring the bastards down for illegal gun running.   &nbsp;   Anytime there's a party there's cake too. We can use your money for the cake if you're really that bothered....   &nbsp;   Ooooh, Don Maclean and Weird Al...two of teh greatest singers around. Unless Don died...I think he was old enough...but still great.   Y'Know weird Al's got a video for that?!   &nbsp;   Hey, Church. Gotta say i can't blame you for getting antsy about the death thing; it gives me the wiggins too, and i've been there  way  too many times. Still, you weren't here at the time so...   &nbsp;   Beer doesn't exactly rot your gut at quite the same rate. Not uless you drink a whole keg to yourself. Daily. And i don't drink it all the time...just most of the time. Ooooh, see, Reeses agrees with me! 'Cept she said it first so technically - we both agree on the point. Listen to your elders.   &nbsp;   Uhhh....*yells* DANIEL!!! Dammit he's not here. I can do spanish or portuguese and maybe a little arabic. Certain phrases in "Ancient Egyptian". "Ancient Latin".

Threw my shoe through him once, while he was tryig to convince me taht i wasn't hallucinating,in between deaths.   &nbsp;   Ah...Halo....'kay, so i've never heard of it. I can relate on the war part though.

      Baka:  Did someone call me?  Kuronue:  No, you...on second thought...imbecile.  Baka:  Ha!  Can't call me idiot can you?  Nope, because my name means idiot.  *laughs triumphantly*  Kuronue:  That's really not something to be proud of.  Baka:  Forget you.  Why don't you just slip out of existence?  Kuronue:  *stares blankly*  Baka:  It seems you already have.  By the way, speaking of Japanese, I am writing a story of how I really met the YYH gang.  It's called "Baka no Hakusho" which means Idiot's Report, but since my name is Baka it is "Baka's Report."  You can also read "The Misadventures of Baka, Cinni, and the YYH Gang."  I'm writing that with Muiya, but I'll probably have to change the title.  The address is bakanohakusho.blogspot.com.  I love it.  Misadventures is bandcinyyh.blogspot.com.  Oh man, Mom's watching The View.  Help!  Kuronue:  What's the matter, Baka?  Don't like that show?  Baka:  It's on the same level as Oprah and Martha Stewart.  Bleah!  Evil!  They are the utter faces of evil.  Kuronue:  Hey, Sparrow, got any room at your place?

      Church:  Well, you see,  I've  never been brought back (there was not even an effort to bring me back), but the Red's sarge was. He had a bullet wound to the head, and apparently they just gave him mouth-to-mouth. I was merely comforted (aka told to die by Tucker).  Actually, the war is still going on (that's why I'm still at Blood Gulch Outpost Alpha, like I'd spend my free time there), but aside from that... What war? That's a good question. Well, you see, after Master Chief destroyed the entire Covenant Armada on Halo, some sort of war broke out, I don't even know why. The two factions (basically that means sides, for those of you who don't know) were Red and Blue. I guess, for now, it's just called The War of Red vs Blue. I hope that answered your question.

      SARAH:  By the standards of Earth, 2004, as as far as most Tau'ri know, I've got to be more normal than most of you. Except maybe the military people.  I see, Church. I've never actually been dead. (Ah, the sheltered life of a Tau'ri! Or Erdling, if you like the term better. Same diff.) But I have memories of coming awfully close.   So you've been brought back, huh? How? I mean... I don't want to say too much, but I thought we didn't have the technology any more than we have the technology to... throw people across the room without touching them and without harming them except for impact with the ground.  What war did you fight in, Church? I don't recognize the sides.

      Church:  Well, so there are other dead people too, huh? Also died multiple times? I've died twice, both times killed by the same person... A member of my own army. Sucks, huh? My initial death was from a tank. The other was when I possessed the Red Armies sergeant, and got shot in the head. Unfortunately, they were able to bring him back to life. Oh, have you ever tried to trick a newly dead man into giving you ten dollars to "get into heaven"? Just wondering. Also, just to straighten things out, I'm a ghost, so being dead to me is just like being alive, only I can be seen through.

      Ehem. *glares pointedly at Sparrow* Rum is a bit stronger than beer, wouldn't you say? Besides, that beer could be going to a good cause: a special occasion. If you drink all the time, it's not a special occasion, and it takes away that pleasure of that knowledge. Doesn't rum have a higher concentration of alcohol than beer?  Again, it's the British people that don't know proper grammer. (Sorry, Jedi master, but your grammer   is   better than hers!)  Oh, we could have plenty of fun conversations. So who thinks Miroku (  Inuyasha  ) and Hoshi (  Enterprise  ) would make a cute couple?  *sighs* Baka (and I mean that in every possible usage of the word), you do realize that for any of us to understand, you're gonna have to be speaking English, "Ancient Egyptian", German, Italian, or maybe Spanish, possibly French. Some might remember bits and pieces of Latin. I'm very proud of knowing two words of Japanese. Any more and it's beyond me.

      CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:   You know what Vinnet... If i wanted to commit suicide i would go to Port Royale.  Rum is not suicide!  And you have somewhat contradicted yourself by saying that it is OK for CJ to drink beer, savvy?  They both do the same thing!   Elizabeth:  Jack does have a point.   CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  CAPTAIN, love.   Elizabeth:  Whatever.  And on Jacks behalf he is not an uncivilized being.  He dosent kill without a good reason.  He saved Will and I in a very smart manner.  He is human, like the rest of us and he makes mistakes, just more than the rest of us.  I am calling off the vote for rum.  Plus, if Jack dosent talk about rum how else are all these fun conversations going to start.   CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:   She finally sides with me *breaks into song* hallelujah, hallelujah _____   Elizabeth:  I can recant my words in a second, Sparrow  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  Shuting up, love ^_^

      SARAH:  Hey, long time no write! Sorry 'bout that; my e-mail's a little goofy at the moment, so I forgot about blogger for a while. Then Jack Sparrow was talking to me this morning, so I figured I'd better get on!     I do my best to avoid such a situation.    *stares* Don't talk about Star Wars with Teal'c? You kidding? That would be awesome, though I have to admit he could hardly know anything about it if he's seen only the movies. That's like just meeting me and not Miss V.   Somehow, I have a feeling he'd have your ass for it only if you got it from the SGC. Now, if you just happened to acquire some explosive material from, say, some rogue NID operation, I don't think anyone would mind.  OH, I know why, K: he e-mailed it in to this cool address that has my name in it. It might could supposed to be something like (Jack's screen name).scifianime@blogger.com or something...  ...No comment to Muiya.   No one is getting any money for alcohol from me unless it's Jack for some going away party for Hammond.   Sheesh! Even the proper British person can't speak proper English!!!  Yay! Go 'Beth Swann! (Hey, that's my middle name!)  "A dark cave far, far away"? DA da da da...! *breaks out into humming the Star Wars theme then changes to Weird Al's parody of "American Pie"* A long, long time ago in a galaxy far away, Nabo--    Please excuse my host's vague references to antiquated movies.     Lesse... On the issue of trading rum... Nay.    Nanei.    On the issue of drinking rum... Nein.    No!    On the issue of talking about rum on this blog... I'm rather indifferent.    No. We are all civilized beings, with the possible exception of the pirate and the demons. There is no reason for us to discuss an effective suicide method.     *Glares at Baka and K.*  Muiya: you kinda have to read it daily in order to not get lost. That and sit in at the lunch table. It helps to know everyone. Wow. I have connections!  Uh, K: Tortuga is where the rum is. Even I know that! Ah! Evil history classes!  Hey, Church. Sorry about the whole death talks, but for one, you weren't here. For two... Some of them have been dead, and well, it really can't be that bad if all your affairs are in order. It's gotta be either blackness, nothingness, in which you can't think and therefore can't care about not being able to think   or   a bright light at the end of a tunnel with general happiness. Unless your affairs aren't in order. Forgive me for the pun, but...   CHURCH.     Okay. I think I'm finally done now.

      Church: Hi, I'm Pvt L.L. Church from the popular web series, Red vs Blue. But I don't come here today as a famous actor, who happens to be really  really  handsome, I come here today because I was invited to this blog, which I've read through and let me just say I find your views on death very offensive. I mean it's bad enough that I'm dead, but for you to rub it in my face like that, it's just mean. Anyway, I've been sporting this light blue armor since my days on Sidewinder, and now I spend my time at Blood Gulch Outpost Alpha, in the Blue Army... Obviously (blue armor).

      (I am adding a new character.  I just think it would be fun to have another girl)  Elizabeth Swann:   Good day to you all.  I hope that you will except me into your chat.  I should probably read so i can establish who everyone is.   *reading ... stops abruptly when she sees Jack*  Oh no, Jack Sparrow!  Mr. Sparrow i do not apreciate you using me in referance to scare someone away from calling you captain.  I am not a scary person, and if you ever payed an ounce of attention you would see that.  Furthermore, i burnt the Rum to save our lifes.  That includes you!  And just in case you have forgoten, which it looks like you have, Rum is a vile drink that can turn even the most respectable men into complete scoundrals.  I agree with Sarah in that Rum is vile and i believe that the talk of Rum and panhandling of money for it should be illegal in this blog. *breathing heavily*  For the rest of you i bid good day.

Will looks at the men on the floor*  Elizabeth, what did you do? Never mind, dont answer that!  You are a bad girl.  You know you shouldent do that, Jack helped rescue our daughter and you do this.  I dont know the other two, but they probably didnt deserve it.  You should be ashamed! *Elizabeth looks down* COME! *Elizabeth follows Will with her head down*  Jenn: i thought that she was a better person than that.

My second favorite dude was voted off, but before he got totally beaten by Ralphie May he did his last bit.  It was about being an artist and making strange creatures like FRONKEYS!  It's just grown on me.  Kuronue:  And there ends the deepest thought that Baka has ever thought.  Baka:  It may seem that my thinking is shallow to you, but I don't say everything that is on my mind.  I just choose to keep some things in my head.  Kuronue:  You could have fooled me.

ANd anyway, I first met Reeses a few years ago when Benjy-benjy-bed kidnapped her. I was just working on teh basis that it was a future version of her. Or an alternate reality thingy...   I should probably be worried that that whole sentece doesn;t cofuse me, or freak me out.   &nbsp;   Well...she has been eating that Alim-whatsis stuff...you can't see it but i'm currenly shuddering.   &nbsp;   Uh...well its not as if Teal'c speaks english as his first language so he'll probably be a slower reader...i wonder when he learnt to read english...?   &nbsp;   Nice to know someone agree- hey! Were you insulting me?!   &nbsp;   Definately some things you never *ever* do to a guy. Even the Evil snakes know that.   &nbsp;   I agree, Reeses, they are slightly scary. ANd i want to know more about these Fronkeys...they seem like my kinda people...   &nbsp;            &nbsp;    #59 D.W.A.R.F.&nbsp;- Weirdo; Keeper of the dimples.       		    urlLink    Yahoo!

I'm not the one who only has about $7.50.  If I want something, then I'll just steal it.  Baka:  Then why do you carry money?  Kuronue:  I have my reasons.  Baka:  I'm dying to know.

Maybe if you just sit down for a moment...   *Sparrow stares, wide-eyed, for a moment, his face plastered in shock and disappointment. Then he flies face-first into the ground and stays there, unable to get up.*  Sparrow? Are you okay?  Anyway, what's this about heaven going backrupt? Isn't that rather contradictive? I mean, with the whole thing about not serving two masters, you can serve either God or Money, so wouldn't there be no money in heaven?  You know, Buddha, I'm not a particular fan of yours, but for Mr. K's sake, if you need me to lend you about 573 yen with a few Greek coins thrown in....

CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: Are you taking it as such, love  Jenn: well how am i supposed to know if it is or isnt if you dont tell me.   Im not that smart.

      Baka:  I know, let's get rid of Buddha and Kuronue and Kenshin and Inu-Yasha.  Buddha, Kuronue, Kenshin, and Inu-Yasha:  No!  *Sanzo, Hakkai, Gojyo, and Goku sneak out back way**Goku carries large bag filled with food*  Inu-Yasha:  You do know that those other guys stole the food, right?  Baka:  No!  Come back here you bloody youkai!  That's our food!  *chases*  *time elasped two hours*  Baka:  *panting heavily*  Damn Hakkai for having a dragon that turns into a jeep.  *collapses on the ground in a state of pure exaustion*

Cooly cool cool!  Kuronue:  *low voice*  Oh great!  Now Baka's going to be slobbering all over this guy!  Baka:  I heard that, idiot.  Sanzo:  Slobbering...?  Kuronue:  Yeah.  Sanzo:  I'm out of here.  *walks away*  Kuronue:  *points to Baka*  Take that with you.  Baka:  Grrr...  Wait Sanzo!  Don't leave me here with HIM!

Kuronue:  *to Sanzo*  Looks like Baka has found her soul mate.  Sanzo:  Better Goku than me.  Gojyo:  *sarcastically*  C'mon pretty boy, you must have thought that little fox was hot.  Sanzo:  I'm going to kill you.  Hakkai:  My, it is crowed in here.  Kuronue:  This does not bode well.

      Church: Hey Jenn, I'll agree with Jack. You do a bad impression of Jack... really bad... such a forced English accent. Anyway, sorry I haven't been talking much. We've been pretty busy, what with capturing one of the Reds and all. I... What?... Hey, Tucker, I'm kinda busy here... I'm talking to some people... No Caboose, you can't talk to them... How can you? It's on  my  radio... You know what... Just shut up... What did you say?... Stop calling me rookie, you are the rookie!... What the he... put that gun down!... Caboose!... That's not funny...

Baka:  He's my mother's father's cousin's accountant's sister's uncle's former roommate's second cousin.  Buddha:  Mind running that by us again?  Baka:  Nope.  He's my mother's father's...  Kuronue:  *to Inu-Yasha*  In other words, there is no relation.

      CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  I agree with Sarah.  We need another person that is...well...more sane than the rest of us.  A voice of wisdom, and common sence.   Sydney Carton: Good day.   Jenn: A Tale of Two Cities is haunting me!!!!! But i dont mind.  Carton: A Tale of Two Cities?  Jenn: The book by charles dickens that depicts the crulties toward the French Nobility during the french revelution.  You are one of the main characters.  Carton: I see.  Well, like Church i find the views about death very disterbing since i am dead.  Although at least i have my head, as it were, on.  Jenn: Thats good to know, expesially since you were beheaded.  Inuyasha: Ouch!  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: Good Day, mate.  Jenn: I am wondering, when i read the book i pictured Sydney Carton as rather like a proper Jack Sparrow.  Which means that he looks like Johnny Depp.  Which means that these two, Sparrow and Carton, look almost identical.  Inuyasha: I see it!   Carton: Weird!  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: Totally!

He's a super evil bad dude.  I can't wait, I want to get Volume Three!  I want to see what Goku looks like in his demon form!  Goku:  What!?  How'd you know about that!?  Baka:  Um...  *starts waving watch in front of Goku's face*  You are getting sleepy.  You are getting sleepy.  Goku:  *grabs watch and throws it across the room**agitated*  How do you know?  Baka:  Hee...hee.  Um... *looks around**eerie sing-song voice*  I'll never tell.

      Sarah:  Not to sound callous or anything, but... Thank goodness they're gone! Why India? Don't they want to see Disney World?  I'm disappointed. You've got the words wrong. It's "When the big One finds you, may this song remind you that they don't serve breakfast in hell!"   *grins facetiously before breaking out into song*  "Hold the milk, put back the sugar; they are powerless to console! We're gathered here to sprinkle ashes  from our late friend's cereal bowl!  Breakfast clubbers say the motto that he taught us to repeat: "You will lose it in your gym class if you wait 'til noon to eat."  Back when the chess club said our eggs were soft,  every Monday he'd say grace and hold our juice aloft. Oh, none of us knew his check-out time would come so soon, but before his brain stopped waving, he composed this tune:  When the toast is burned and all the milk has turned and Captain Crunch is waving farewell, when the Big One finds you, may this song remind you that they don't serve breakfast in hell!"  *whips out shiney/fingerprinted guitar (and green pick) and starts playing the guitar solo, ending the whole facade in a four-string G chord*

      Sarah:  Oh, okay. I think I've got it, Sparrow. You never want me to say "sit" *He flies into the ground* again. :D  Mr. K, has your Christian buddy not had any influence on you? Stealing is BAD. Violence is BAD. Drugs are BAD. (Sorry, I've had my chocolate today.    Unfortunately.   )  Yeah, I'm shuddering, too. Alim'to is like braces. No one should have to go through that.    It's highly nutritional, though. You Tau'ri put too much stock in taste.     I see. Maybe we could have done without the fronkeys. To be truthful, the angels described in the Bible sound just as freaky-looking.  *Sees what Elizabeth did to Jack and helps him up.* What you do to these poor people trying to make an honest living!  *sics Garshie, a black husky mix, on Inuyasha* You know what, dog face? I like Jenn. I think she's got a great sense of humor. I'm not going to let you insult her, got it, mutt-boy? I think you're cute and all, but I'm not letting that get in my way. *Garshie chomps down on InuYasha's puffy red pants and doesn't let go, despite the half-demon's flailing.* And don't you dare laugh, Sparrow, or you're next. Garshie isn't quite as tame as he looks!  Umm... Church? You alright?  Wait, a   demon   likes the X-files? *rolling on the floor, laughing. Garshie returns to sniff Sarah's face.*  *Sarah composes herself.* I like your Jack Sparrow accent, Jenn. It's better than mine!  Alright. Sorry to be rude and all, but who invited all of you? (Hakkai, Sanzo, Goku, Gojyo, and for the most part, Buddha)  Oh, food's the problem? *whips out several unmarked plastic bags with mushy stuff like grits and chicken salad in them* If you're really hungry, the base cafeteria insisted I bring some of this home. I don't really like it, so you're more than welcome to take the whole stock. *whips out chocolate bar and starts to eat it* This is more my    *spits out chocolate* I will   not   have any of that near me!!!    C'mon, Vinnet? I'll let you eat some peanut butter when we get home....    Fine. *pouts* As long as I can eat enough to rinse the poison from my mouth.    Um, Vinnet? It's   my   mouth. I hope you realize that.  How nice of you guys to play two of my favorite classic rock songs! Anyone know "Breakfast" or other Newsboys songs? The really famous Switchfoot song? Audio A?  Well, um, Jenn... I've heard you sing a little....  Wow!! Mr. K, you know a word I don't know! Happy, happy! You should be chuffed!

All my dreams pass before my eyes, a curiosity.  Dust in the wind, all they are is dust in the wind.  Same old song just a drop of water in an endless sea. All we do crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see.  Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind.  Now, don't hang on. Nothing lasts forever, but the earth and sky. It slips away and all your money won't another minute buy.  Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind. Dust in the wind, everything is dust in the wind. Dust in the wind, everything is dust in the wind.  Lindsay:  I would like to apologize to Kansas for the poor lyrics, but I had to write them from memory and I'm not sure if that is really what it looks like.  *shruggs**disappears*

      Baka:  *sitting on the floor**Lindsay dictating through Baka*  Kurama was, is, a fox demon from the Makai.  He's over three hundred years old.  The same can be said for Kuronue, except he's a bat demon.  Kuronue was killed long ago when the both of them were fleeing from the Castle of the Demon World.  Kurama continued to steal, until approximately fifteen years ago he was running from spirit hunters and was blasted to the Human World, supposed dead.  He then took the form of a human child named Suichi Minamino and repented for his sins.  Kurama used to have long white hair and ears like you Inu-Yasha, even yellow eyes, but he had a tail.  Now he resembles a human boy with long red hair and bright green eyes.  I believe you also are shorter, aren't you?  *Kurama nods*  He is unable to turn back into Yoko Kurama, his demon form, because he lacks the energy.  He can transform, however, with the aid of specific spirit items like the Idunn Box.  Kuronue:  Been busy while I was in Hell, eh?  Kurama:  You have no idea.  Kuronue:  How does she know all of that?  Baka (not Lindsay any more):  Let's just say you two have a really, REALLY big fan in the real world.

Kurama:  You should know.  Kuronue:  *stares at Kurama for a bit**cautiously*  Kurama...?  Kurama:  Indeed.  Kuronue:  You look different with red hair.  Baka:  *suddenly waking up from her spell**looks at Kurama, then Kuronue*  I see I have some explaining to do.  *the two other demons (excluding Inu-Yasha{no offense}) stare at Baka*

Kurama:  *reading Baka's first statement*  What is "Furuba"?  Baka:  It's short for Fruits Basket.  Your voice is featured on the anime.  Kurama:  What?  Baka:  You're Sohma Shigure!

      Haimanton (Weird Kendo Guy):  Hi, I'm new here. My name is Haimanton, you can call me Weird Kendo Guy, I guess. That's what my General calls me. Oh, by the way my name is pronounced like Hey-mon-tone. That's pretty much it.

      Baka:&nbsp; So, you all were just trying to make her leave?&nbsp; Could you get rid of Kuronue for me?  Kuronue:&nbsp; *smacks Baka in the head**angered*&nbsp; I heard that.  Baka:&nbsp; Ow!&nbsp; Kuro's hitting me!  Kuronue:&nbsp; Shut up, you're so annoying.  Kurama:&nbsp; You brought that on yourself  Kuronue:&nbsp; *mumbling*&nbsp; I used to be the only one that Lindsay had in here.&nbsp; What happened?  Lindsay:&nbsp; *peeks around corner*&nbsp; Did someone say my name?

Jenn: What is "that"  Inuyasha: a word  Jenn NO, the "that that" you are all talking about  Elizabeth: Oh that  Carton:&nbsp; nothing  Jenn: how can it be "nothing" if you are saying it happens  Inuyasha: its over, so now it is nothing  Jenn: But i want to know what it, or "that", is  Carton: You said you read ATOTC- you figure it out  Jenn: grrrr *storms out*  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:&nbsp;finally we got her to leave&nbsp;*safe comes down (like in cartoons) and hits Jack in the head*

Baka:&nbsp; When'd you get back?     &nbsp;     Kuronue:&nbsp; Ask the person who is up at 12:30 in the morning writing on this thing without her parents knowing.     Lindsay:&nbsp; (Another camio appearance by the slealty spy)&nbsp; I am a spy, I sneak around at night.     &nbsp;   Baka:&nbsp; Did we really need a narration?     &nbsp;   Kurama:&nbsp; But it's morning.     &nbsp;   Lindsay:&nbsp; You know I have ultimate power over you and can easily do something  bad  to you?     &nbsp;   Baka:&nbsp; Ah, but I also have supreme power here, because I am the registered user.     &nbsp;   *Lindsay glares darkly at the bitailed demon*

        Thellas: I wouldn't be so certain. Fremen can be quite extreme.     &nbsp;  Sarah: Whoa, Baka, that was really random, but while we're on the subject... I really haven't been around that much violence, but I've been shot in the leg once and zatted, let's see, at least twice, probably more.     &nbsp;   Vinnet: My host thinks she's been though so much. I have been shot a couple times by staff weapons, once by a weapon of the Tau'ri,     and countless times by zatn'katel.        &nbsp;  Sarah: Well, technically, it was her hosts getting shot, not she. *senses Vinnet's temper rising* But, you know, symbiotes feel every bit of the pain hosts perceive. *Vinnet seems satisfied*      &nbsp;

       Sarah:&nbsp; And nobody has good grammer. Sheesh, people! I mean, I know half of you are from earlier years/alternate realities, but that's really no excuse for not knowing how to speak in proper English!    Khala: What about me?    Sarah: *nods head* Okay, well, you  do  have an excuse, considering you're not really from Earth at all, but... I just kinda figured that most Tok'ra instinctively knew English. I guess if I really think about it, though, they (or y'all) weren't here for the Battle of Hastings in 1066, when English became greatly influenced by French for 1550, when English went though the great vowel change. It's a wonder all Tok'ra and Goa'uld don't speak Old English...    &nbsp;   Vinnet: My host does not realize that all are not as interested in etymology as she.       &nbsp;  Sarah: Well, I  technically, consciously  realize it, but convincing my inner self... *considers Vinnet* my  other  inner self, takes some doing.   Wow. That's surpisingly little for how much I've missed. Guess there wasn't much to comment on this time around. *glances around room*   Oh, I want you all to meet one of the newer Tok'ra, Khala. Why don't you introduce yourself?    &nbsp;  Khala: *nods* I am a Fremen from Arrakis, also known as Dune. Do not try to travel there; our Stargate has been sealed. I am certainly a new host for the Tok'ra. *eyes flash*    &nbsp;   Thellas: A word of caution concerning the antics presented here: my host has a short temper and an often-used knife. To anger her would not benefit your health.    *several gulps sound from around the room*   Sarah: But, you know, as long as we're all friends here, we shouldn't have any problems, right? *stares pointedly at Baka, Sparrow, and the K-people (Khala excluded)*

       Sarah: Well, I'm more than happy to tell you. I get used to this kind of thing, it being my job and all. Tok'ra (and Goa'uld) have naquada in their blood. Now, when other naquada is in the vacinity, the molecules polarize, positive end toward the source, sending a signal to the brain that there is naquada nearby in a particular direction. Since other Tok'ra, Goa'uld, and Jaffa, as well as those who were once one of the above have the naquada in them, they can be sensed by Tok'ra like myself and Khala.      Naquada was also a particular period in Ancient Egyptian history here on Earth. It's probably the era just before Ra's foothold in Egypt was overthrown and the Stargate buried.      Vinnet: This was all derived from Major Carter's research on the subject; we Tok'ra have neither the time nor interest for such matters. For us, it is not so much why we can sense each other as it is that we can.
