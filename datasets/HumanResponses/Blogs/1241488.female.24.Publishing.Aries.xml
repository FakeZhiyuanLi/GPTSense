      damn, it happened to me again. blogger should get their buttons fixed.  we played last night at Meh's benefit thing.  A lot of bands were there: Boldstar, Twisted Halo, Sugarfree, Kiko Machine, etc... We were second.  It was ok except thatAyn and I weren't feeling too well because of the bug we caught atthe hospital, and Allan and Ralph were having imaginary bugs too.  I couldn't dance like the last two times we had a gig... i just put my hands in my pockets and stared at the floor.  I'm surprised nobody made a comment like the one in Metallurgica ("Pare, sa sobrang shoegaze niyo, hindi pa ba nababali mga leeg niyo?").  I felt like I was going to puke onstage. But the gig was good. As usual, Roel just had to make a statement (ehem). Allan left right after because he had to go to Malate for Moonstar or some other band.  We saw Charms and Jovy of Matilda and they said Meh was doing great, aside from her head being stapled together.  I'm really glad she's ok.  Chris and I were just so tired that we slept in Ayn's van after the performance.  We would wake up from time to time... I saw Jovan but I was too queasy to call her attention.  We couldn't stand the stuffiness and the mosquitos anymore so we decided to leave Ayn there hehehe...  Why do I get crap when I search for "candyaudioline" on google?? and why doesn't my blog come out on it even after i'veadded the url? sigh... how will people find out about us...  I feel like shit. My body is so sore. I am going on a self-imposed retreat this weekend.  Must finish thesis.  Will be holing up somewhere in Paranaque.  See you next week.

      Yellow!  We did visit Meh Antonio of Matilda yesterday at St. Lukes Hospital and she’s doing very well.  We could tell she was tired, but she still made the effort to entertain us (which is more than another person would do even if they were in the best of health).  Ayn brought her dad along and I brought Chris.  Allan was supposed to come with us but I don’t know what came up.  Ayn had bought red roses for Meh’s room and she signed the card “from candyaudioline”.  It was funny because both Ayn and I were wearing red, too, and it seemed as if we dressed alike just for the purpose of visiting Meh.  We picked up Ralph and Charmaine on our way back to Ayn’s house.  We were wondering what was taking Allan so long.  Ayn’s dad took us instead to Sangkalan Restaurant along Commonwealth where we were going to have dinner.  Supposedly, Ayn’s family always celebrates EDSA I because they actively participated in it before.  Charmaine, Chris, Ayn and I had a lot of fun with the seafood but Ralph had to make do with just the tilapia because he’s allergic (wait a minute—I’m allergic too! Hehehe…)  Allan finally arrived after we were all done; he waited for Eloha and her boyfriend at Philcoa.  They were going to practice for the Softpillowkisses gig after our movie marathon.  We headed on to Ayn’s.  While they were setting up the video, we played with Tristania, who had this very dopey, sleepy look on her face.  She’s so cute!!! She looks even chubbier with her hair combed down and I couldn’t stop giggling.  I bet she felt so harassed with all her ninongs and ninangs fussing over her.  She finally went to sleep on Charmaine’s lap.  We watched Ring 2 and Ring 0.  Chris and I had already seen it several times so we started getting sleepy.  And Allan was so conscious about the time since Softpillow had to practice afterwards.  It really wasn’t the candy movie marathon I had hoped it would be, but I guess we can find another day to make up for it.  Tristania, on the other hand, woke up and refused to fall asleep again.  She was trying to watch the movie; we kept trying to block her view because the images might be burned into her head even if she can’t understand them yet hahaha. Paranoid ninangs!  Anyway, after the movie, we just dropped everyone else at the studio and Ayn brought me and Chris home.  Allan, still having problems with posting?

      Last night, we went to Precious Baldo’s wake at the UP Chapel.  She was the only casualty of the Kamia Residence Hall Mishap last February 18, 2003.  It’s been a week today. Still no justice.  I was with Ayn and Roel and we were just in time to join the procession back to Kamia, where relatives of Precious were going to fetch her things and bring her body back to Benguet.  Her friends and dorm mates sang songs while we walked.  It was the first time Ayn and I saw the place since it happened.  The metal barriers were really wrecked and there was broken glass around.  Candle drippings lined the pile of debris, probably from the night Precious died.  One of her relatives asked to be shown the exact spot where she lay.  He stood over it and said some words in their language.  Ayn told me he was telling Precious to go home, that her schooling was over now.  I think the part where I most faltered was seeing Precious’ younger relative, a brother perhaps, carrying some of her things, among them a guitar.  How hard is that—to be bringing your sister’s things home knowing she’ll never be able to use them again… things that she probably used a little more than a week ago?  The van carrying her coffin needed a guide out of UP so we volunteered.  Along University Ave, we said goodbye and went on our way.  They went on theirs soon after, too.  They still had a long journey ahead of them.  We, on the other hand, went to Starbucks Katipunan.  Tried to shake the solemnity off with some mocha frapps… that is, Roel and Ayn did.  We started smiling again when Ayn was trying to rifle through her messy bag for the hundred pesos her dad supposedly gave her—Roel wanted to have a mocha frapp, too.  Then she says maybe her dad didn’t give it to her after all. Haha!  Roel had to buy it himself.    That was the first time we had a bonding session without Allan.  Damn, I wish I could remember all the stuff we talked about but I think all this lack of sleep is starting to mess with my brain.  That was around 1 am.  We had to bring Roel back to Mayric’s because he had spent his fare on the mocha frapp and besides, he said, Allan was there and we could hang out (and maybe get some food out of him hehe).  There was a Parokya ni Edgar gig there and he was overseeing things.  On the way there, I told them I had started this blog.  Of course, Ayn had a few things she wanted put so I’ll say them now:  On the 27th we’ll be having a benefit at Mayric’s for Meh Antonio, one of the victims of the Kamia Mishap.  We also had a pictorial for the PULP Summer Slam last Saturday (I forgot to put that).  Watch out for the new Kamikazee video, where Roel plays the evil villain.  The evillain hehee.  I think that’s all.  We arrived and Allan offered to buy us a beer each.  We also had chicharon bulaklak, which I miss since I haven’t been having isaw at UP lately. Sigh.  We were pleasantly buzzed.  Pinagchismisan namin ni Ayn yung mga nandun sa Mayric’s hehehe (you know who I’m talking about, Ayn).  We had to wait until about 3 for Allan to be finished with managerial duties.  Allan says what I’m about to write is no longer candyaudioline business but Superminty business, but what the hey.  He and John Paul and Charles (the latter two from Popular Days) flipped a coin to decide if they were going to do… ahem… “Superminty business” or not.  Suffice it to say, they flipped heads.  Anyway… I guess that’s all I can say about that.  Allan will kill me if I say anything more ;)  Besides, John Paul is witness that there is a God.  Today, we plan to visit Meh and maybe push through with our candy movie marathon at Ayn’s.

      At last.  You have no idea how hard it has been to get to this point.  All this trouble for a blog. 	 First, I did a really nice and really long introduction for candyaudioline’s official blog.  I was two sentences away from finishing it when Yahoo Mail sends this stupid notification that I had new mail.  I was caught off-guard.  I panicked, clicked away, and there went all traces of my beautiful intro.  All of it.  Everyone knows the feeling.  Your guts turn to water and you slump dejectedly in your seat.  But you still have some fire left in you.  You start over, thinking to yourself that all is not lost.  That’s what I did.  I picked up the pieces of fragmented thought in my brain and typed away.  This time, I let everyone know how pissed I was.  As the new intro took shape, I marveled in satisfaction at all the vitriol.  I read it, smirked, clicked.  This was candyaudioline history.  And then, I realized I had clicked the wrong button.  Everything went poof once more.  Argh.  After some trial and error, I finally learned how to work the damned thing.  Lo and behold the first entry—“This is candyaudioline.” 	 Which brings me to the present.  I’m just too tired now, after seeing everything disappear into internet limbo.  If this intro sounds inadequate, my sincerest apologies.  The band consists of:  Allan Montero – vocals, guitars, songwriter, all-around kingpin and financier Ralph Romero – guitars, webmaster, keeper of mystique (to borrow from Cameron Crowe) Ayn Ruth – bass, femme fatale Selena Salang – vocals, resident paranoid—and I don’t mean this in a cute way, as you’ll discover along the way (yours truly) Roel … - drums (Sorry, Roel, I never really found out your last name… will update)  We’re from the Philippines.  We play indie/shoegaze.  I’m still reluctant to use labels because I can’t tell the difference (!).  As far as I’m concerned, it’s simple enough—it’s kickass music.  The Latest:  1.	We played at “Metallurgica: The Science of Rock” the other night at the Sta Lucia East parking lot.  There was a contest for memorizing the line-up (in order: Milk and Money, Kiljoy, Monsterbot, Pentavia, Cover Me Quick, candyaudioline, Moyg, Hammilan, Cog, Cheese).  The gig itself was strange.  Everybody else was adhering to the metal theme.  We tried, but somehow we stuck out, I think.  On the other hand, people noticed we were different.  That doesn’t necessarily mean they enjoyed us, though.  After all, they did go there to mosh.  2.	Headed to Mister Kebab as usual for an after-gig bonding session.  I think food is an integral part of candyaudioline’s existence.  If you look at the name, you’ll definitely note the Freudian connection.  Over special chelo, upside down and keema, we discussed how we sounded at Metallurgica, points to work on, and the mailing list (candyaudioline@yahoogroups.com).  We like to listen to recordings of our performances because we’re still experiencing growing pains as a band (mostly my fault since I’m still adjusting).  On the tape, my voice sounded a little better than the last time, but still too loud when nervous, and some of the guitars couldn’t be heard as much as we liked.  Allan tells us kids that what comes out of the board isn’t usually what the audience hears; he says extraneous factors like echo and extra fuzz and blahblah make the actual sound better.  It was decided that a live journal be kept for the band and the task was assigned to me.  Finally, a concrete contribution on my part.  3.	Our EP is almost out.  We’re just having a little problem with budget and we’re trying to find the most practical way of releasing the album.  Anyway, we hope it’ll push through soon since this will be the first output for this configuration of candyaudioline.  Patience!  4.	We’ll be part of PULP Magazine’s Summer Slam on April 30, 2003.  Okay, this is it for now.  This is candyaudioline’s official blog, aiming to document the band’s endeavors.  As blogmaster, I’ll try to be as objective and as accurate as possible.  Don’t expect this to be absolute, though, since everything will still be filtered through my perception of the experience of being in the band.  Do join our mailing list.  Do buy our EP when it comes out.  Do come to Buzz Nite every month.  Do visit our website when Ralph gets to finish it.  Do drop in.  Do eat your carrots.  Don’t stick one in your bellybutton, though.  Oh yeah… who the hell got first dibs on the username “candyaudioline”?  Had to settle for something else. Boo.

(goodluck!) that means that candyaudioline would be out for two weeks not unless yours truly decides to take matters into his own mouth... hhmmm...   swimming!!!

      grabe may isa pa tayong member sa egroups natin! Heeheehee!  I was thinking, though… kawawa naman siya kasi di naman tayo nagpopost masyado dun sa egroups.  Nilalangaw tayo dun eh. But then again, that’s an advantage for that member since we seldom send weird forwards and yucky shit, therefore, less chance of us spamming his/her email.  Naks naman, Allan.  Was truly touched by your pledge of love in the last post. Weirdo ng spiel mo dun about the cd—I thought you were talking about real people! (Oh, wow, didn’t I just spoil the genius of the joke right there…) whatever. Basta na-touch ako dun. Pagbubutihin ko na tuloy yung pagkanta ko kasi dati hindi hehehe…  I hate the war. War is bad. I don’t even want to think about it because I get depressed (which isn’t good for me, either, because I don’t produce songs from the depression).  I just noticed that so many countries have huge mass demonstrations while ours just has a teeny tiny one.  Doesn’t anyone care here anymore? I guess they’re too busy worrying about more pressing problems like where to get food. Never mind. Just being sad.  Moonstar 88 had something at Claret yesterday and Allan invited me to check it out.  I thought the event was some kind of fair—I wore my weirdly cut pants, tribus, a big floppy shirt, and a body bag.  I knew something was wrong when I saw one boy wearing a leather jacket and white slacks outside… it was a dance/sit-down dinner.  Oh well, they looked at me, I looked at them, yadayada… at least i got to people watch.  Some of the guys there looked like they came out of Buzz Nite.  As I was watching the couples slow dancing, I remembered when I was a sophomore at high school, when holding a boy that close was a big deal.  I think Allan was just thankful that all the boys dancing were holding girls in their arms.  Sir Charles, Sir John Paul, and their friend/bandmate (I think his name is Eric?) caught up with us there, and inspite of their urge to groove to that dance tune “Happy”, we moved on to a birthday party somewhere in Project 6.  There was food and a lot of drink and I felt so bad (now so sad) that I couldn’t partake.  My doctor said I have a liver problem and I have to stay away from salty stuff. Sigh.  Gusto ko yung boses ni Francis. I can imagine him singing “Indian Summer”.  Sana dumating na sila sa next Buzz Nite. Oy Allan, tuloy mo kuwento mo sa taxi. And give me the next two weeks to finish my thesis… then I can post regularly.  Ralphyboy, ano na sa website?

      wow! i'm still alive!!!  guess what happened to us a while ago or last night... i thought it was going to be one of those gig days wherein you'll just waste your time because you're only given two songs...   we played in this benefit gig at the up bahay ng alumni called "emergency"... for the accident victims of camia... we were slated to play the early portion of the show... as usual "mas marami pa ang pimple ng isang friend ko whom, would not be named than the people in attendance during that time of the gig... okey lang, sobrang aliw naman, kasi aside from our usual candy-in-our-own-world approach sa tugtugan the equiptment that was used was really ace!  plus there were a few familiar faces mostly band members who were able to see us perform (aminin nyo na! manghang-mangha kayo cguro sa kaya naming gawin ano?)... sana hindi sila nabingi.... hehehehe...  after that, we went straight to mayrics for an impromtu set (12 songs... aliw!!!). which i really missed doing... before that, we had this bonding meal consisting of rice and chicharon bulaklak. walang tao nung mag start kami pero may mga pumasok din eventually... kakahiya lang nga sa kanila because sobrang snob yung dating namin eventhough i was able to dish out a few spills here and there. we still find it very difficult to talk to a crowd... i for one think that it's a total waste of time because i feel that we are  just making a fool of ourselves knowing that not even a single  soul in that venue would give a fuck as to what we're doing...  receptive naman cla. i guess they were able to to like some of the songs we did, specially the poppier ones like "don't go away", pretend that we're smart", "nearby town" and "flaming walls".  sana dumating yung time na masaykan na rin kami ng madlang lahat, nang sa gayon ay yumaman na kami. para ay next time na kumain ako sa shakeys, d na ako magdadalawang isip kung oorder pa ba ako nga strawberry shake dala ng sobrang pagtitipid...  hay naku... wla na akong masulat dito ah... basta sobrang nag-enjoy ako kanina... we (me and roel) even went back to up to attend to a band that we manage... i saw a few friends of mine there that i've not seen for quite sometime now... hay naku, ang gaganda na nila ngayon (kaya lang ang payat mo na pats). si other pretty faced friend of mine has a band na rin ngayon (Trivia:  if ayn hadn't met mich, this gal should've been singing for  candy, ang lakas pa naman ng appeal nya... uuuuyyyy ngingiti yan pag nabasa nya ito!)   oh well, that's all for now... sana okey yung kinalabasan nun benefit gig na yun... iwas a bit bothered by the fact na none of the bands that i saw mentioned anything in conjuction with the said event or even expressed opinion about the victims of the accident icluding your's truly... wala lang... i just feel a bit guilty that's all!!!  Funniest chu-chu of the day comes from our often times "away" bassist ayn:            eto yun!       guy from another band: (with all sincerity) wow!!! ang galing galing nyo sobrah!!!                                ayn: (in her usual "away" self) ah... salamat!!! kayo rin, ang galing nyo!!!     guy from another band: (blushing) hah!  eh... hindi pa kami tumutogtog eh!                                    ayn: (poised na poised) sa CD!  moral of the conversation: umiwas sa taong gutom!!! hahahahaha!

      can't sleep... keep thinking about lots of things... and it bothers me to think that... ah never mind... still can't figure out how to use this damn program anyway...  we're in the middle of march and i still haven't found a cheap means of getting our ep out... oh well, maybe it's not yet time... or maybe i'm not trying hard enough... what if i die later, tomorrow or  a week from now... what would become of my work... now i'm depresed!!!   oh well, there are few good things to look forward to... tuesday's gig is one, also a pulp article about candyaudioline which i am cynically looking forward to, that long delayed candyaudioline website, the black saturday gig in subic with almost all of the backbeat bands (parokya ni edgar, cheese, moonstar88 & kamikazee... wish hammilan and the youth could make it) and yes that summerslam gig - i hope by this time i've written a new song that would blow all our other songs away, which leads me to the issue of my not having written a song for more than a year now... i was able to write some but mostly throaways... but wait, when i did "better view" for candy and "beneathe the glare" for pillow, i kinda considered them as "hilaw" or "walang patutunguan" items... maybe i'm just putting to much pressure on myself...   oh well... today's monday, tomorrow's tuesday...GIG TIME is always a GOODTIME for me!!!

      Sigh. There’s just no pleasing some people.  Allan is still complaining I don’t write enough.  But nothing happens with the band in between my posts anyway! Am I supposed to put my personal stuff in here, too? (Nope, I have another blog for that).  Haha. Maybe I’m supposed to be writing a story about the band… something nice and exciting and obscene and totally… fictional!  We’re just ordinary people, you know.  We have lives away from the band.  Allan is part of Backbeat Management and he handles bands like Parokya ni Edgar, Moonstar 88, Cheese and Hammillan.  Roel helps him out with the roadie stuff hehe (it’s a living, ain’t it?).  Ralph used to work as an IT/web-developer for some company… but he quit and I think he’s either looking for another stint like that or has already found one.  Ayn and I are still students at UP Diliman.  So the thing is, when I don’t write in here, were just getting on with our own lives.  I guess it would be interesting if I did some crazy stuff here, as long as it pertains to the band.  Ok, I’ll try to think of something by Tuesday, but for now I’ll do some straight reporting.  We’ll see.  A lot of people were at Mayric’s last night for the Feminine Force shindig.  The NU crowd was there, the female ones, that is.  Nandun si Diego kasi tumugtog ang Cambio ;) hehe… pero shy ako masyadong pansinin siya.  It’s really stupid, you know… we’ve had conversations before and we’re practically relatives!  I guess I just get weird with people I wanna be friends with. Allan said my boyish persona disappears whenever I do that hahaha! Whatever!  We played a good set, according to Herbert.  The sound was good.  I was really nervous last night and a little paranoid.  I was actually worried about singing “Discarded Toy” because it was about a girl who was left high and dry… I was afraid it was in bad taste to sing about that at a night of women’s empowerment.  Sheesh… as if being dumped wasn’t a universal experience!  Anyway, I was so nervous and all my muscles were tensed up the whole time.  Afterwards, I had a really bad backache.  God, I should lighten up, REALLY.  The rest of them sounded good, though, even to me onstage.  Allan scolded me for taking the mic from the front when he deliberately placed it there for optimal volume.  I took it in my hands instead, and I kept backing up into the drums (NERVES!), making the mic absorb the sound of the instruments along with my voice.  But we prevailed! Mwahahahahahahahahahahaha!  Charms really enjoyed us… (ok ba sa pikit?;)  Kaya lang napaiyak ako sa labas pagkatapos.  All the tension got the best of me, and when Allan started on the mic issue, I burst.  It was really funny and pathetic of me to do that but I was happy for the release.  We looked especially ridiculous because we were outside the bar and everyone could see.  Hay naku.  Ganyan talaga ako. Madrama.  But it sure is fun to see Allan panic like that!  Men never know what to do with such outward displays of emotion.  We ate at the Timog Avenue food exchange in front of the Shell station.  Obviously, Allan and the great Sir Charles and Sir John Paul just wanted to see the late night/ early morning goods (and this after playing at a Women’s Month celebration!).  Still, Ayn, Charms, Ralph and I enjoyed the food.  It’s amazing how they can make steak from tuna, and the Zamboanga chicken was simple and amazingly good.  Sana dun na lang next time uli!  Expect something weird and trippy for the next few entries.

      This entry is a little late because I was too tired to write yesterday.  The other day, March 8, 2003 we played at two events: the Immaculate Conception Foundation and Buzz Nite.    At the former, we were given three songs to play.  I guess the sound system sucked because the kids in front were complaining that they couldn’t hear my voice.  They kept screaming “louder”.  So I tried to sing louder.  But they still didn’t hear me.  Allan said it was because the speakers were to the side and that only the people in front couldn’t hear.  The rest of them could.  Now I was thinking… why didn’t they say all those things to Kyla or Cover Me Quick or that high school band?  I didn’t think it was because I was singing too softly because my throat was straining to make it loud.  Why does this always happen to me? Why can’t I assess the sound system properly and adjust? I’m always so clueless about it.  I felt so bad afterwards because I heard them say we were a voiceless band—and after trying so hard.  My band mates don’t think it’s too bad.  They tell me I do fine, and that we really play like that (with less emphasis on the vocals).  I understand that, of course… but I feel like what little I contribute to the band is undermined whenever I sing too loud or too softly, or even when people just perceive it that way through the sound system’s weirdness. Sigh.  Anyway, once we left the school I felt better.  When we got to Mayric’s, though, there was nobody there.  Only one band was there, plus Roel’s girlfriend and Charles and John Paul.  Allan had already warned us that the usual crowd of Buzz Nite wasn’t going to show up because of the indie pop gig on the 14th, but I honestly wasn’t prepared for what we saw.  It wasn’t too bad, though. Candyaudioline got to play two sets ;). And it was kind of intimate hehehe.  A sort-of-punk band called Sunset Drive and a sort-of-something band called Skrew Ups played.  Crush ni Ayn yung isa dun sa latter band hehehe (shet, papatayin ako nun… ah basta eh di baguhin niya tong entry hehe).  Then there were Soft Pillow Kisses and Superminty.  We really appreciated the fact that those other bands came at such short notice.  They’ll probably be at the next Buzz Nite (if any).  Which brings me to my next topic.  We decided to go for a change and eat at Ongpin’s beside Mister Kebab.  After eating sinigang, sizzling squid, sweet and sour pork, and papaitan, Allan brought up the subject of Buzz Nite and what happened.  I found it weird for the other indie bands to snub Buzz Nite in favor of ShelfLife night.  Why not play at both?  The thing is, Buzz Nite was always the venue for this genre.  What happened?  We were thinking that the other indie bands aren’t satisfied with the type of music played at Buzz Nite anymore.  There are those who don’t like the other bands usually lined up and say it should be indie pop night.  What gives?  I know I’m the biggest, stupidest newbie around, but I always thought that Buzz Nite was for the whole indie genre.  Anyway, where were those people last Saturday night?  It seems like everyone wants to jump ship.  So the guys talked about it and they were thinking of revamping Buzz Nite and sticking to the original idea of it, which was to hold an event that will include “all genres under the indie spectrum”.  They were still thinking of how to do it… whether to change the venue, the name, or just the concept.  I think that’s a better idea.  If we’re to have a special night for our genre, we have to take care of it.  I don’t think that’s the case these days. So let’s change the system!  Okay… on the 18th we’re playing at the third benefit concert for the Kamia victims.  This will be at the Bahay ng Alumni and rumor has it that Matilda will be playing again! Yehey!  On the 15th, Roel says we’ll also be playing at the Feminine Force at Mayric’s. Did I get that right?

      Allan allan allan. sorry.  Allan said last night at practice that i don't write enough here.  Excuse me. We haven't been doing anything the past week, so why should i write?  anyway, tomorrow is Buzz Nite at Mayric's so don't forget to pass by.  Wear purple in support of International Women's day ;)  We practiced all the old candy songs last night and it felt good. i was hoping we'd change our repertoire a little, though i still like "an empty you".  We fixed "waste my time" so that i wouldn't have to die while singing it, and it sounds solid.  Also, i'm starting to feel comfortable singing even the high ones... i actually pulled off "broken to pieces" without, um, dying. It was great to hear everyhting live again, and not just from the cd Allan gave me.  I'm excited to record all of it one day.  Ralph says he's almost finished with the site. Hurrah! He says it's going to be an all-in-one and i won't have to be using this blog anymore... i can put it there.  Hope he finishes it soon.  i'm sure there are some people out there other than us who'dlike to see it up and running already hehe.  Speaking of the band's endeavors, we talked about the CD again at Mister Kebab.  Still the same problems... where to get the money, which is the cheapest, highest quality process, that stuff.  We're actually considering the unthinkable: treating it as a demo and approaching big names.  but i think we all don't really want to do that.  i hope we find a sponsor or something. maybe something.  Roel lent his Mao cap to someone and that person lost it.  He was hankering for a new one so I offered to give him Chris's.  I just wanted to write that because i wanted Roel to be mentioned in the blog hehehe. i'll give it to him later.  Ayn took Tristania out to the mall the other day.  What a princess that baby is ;) i miss her already.  so. Ralph and Allan and i were planning to meet online this morning but i was too tired. still am. tootle-loo!

      hay naku kabobohan...  I typed a long entry a while ago straight onto this post. when I was finished, instead of posting it, i went to my other blog. hayyyyyyyyy... nawala lahat.  tinatamad tuloy ako. anyway, I just wrote about me leaving for Bukidnon after the Summer Slam.  I'll be there for almost 3 weeks, but I don't think that means that candyaudioline will be offline. Allan is thinking of having Lara from SPK session, or he'll do it himself. sila pa rin naman yun, kaya worth it din pumunta sa gigs. tuloy ang ligaya.  mamimiss ko kayo boohoohoo... i'll try to update even while i'm in Bukidnon. Sana makapost na ulit dito sina Ayn. Bye!

      You guys probably think I’m such an ass for not updating the blog when I’ve finally graduated and supposedly have nothing more important to do… WRONG! Let’s just say that UP is not the most efficient office during summer enlistment…  Anyway, I am here to talk about our Subic activity.  We had all agreed to meet at Jollibee EDSA/Kamias at 12 noon, Black Saturday. Surprise.  Jollibee was closed.  But that was ok too because we didn’t have to buy anything to be able to park.  Ayn and I had only been there a minute when Ralph and Charmaine arrived, together with Erap and Dodong of The Youth.  Robert and Rosa arrived around 20 minutes later, but still no sign of Allan and the Youth Van.  At around 1 or 1:30, it finally arrived and we were off.  We picked up Sir Charles and John Paul on the way, stopped over at Shell North Expressway for a late lunch, and THEN straight for Subic.  How can I describe the trip… it was long and yet short.  It felt long, but when we got there, we didn’t expect to get there so soon.  The ride wasn’t really a barrel of laughs as I had hoped because most of us lacked sleep and we were just staring off into space or listening to our own music. Allan brought out his compilations… meron pa siyang Doolittle ng Pixies so kantahan yung iba.  Revised especially for the Knights: “Here comes your maaan—YAK!!!”  It never ends.  All the bands were there so it was just a matter of meeting them inside Subic.  Of course, we got lost because of the weirdly printed map (hooray for SBMA)… and when we got to the Admiral House, the bands were just leaving for a motorcade. We were tired and weewee so we decided to rest for a bit and nix the parade.  Ayn and I had our picture taken in front of the stairs, as usual… ang gaganda namin ;} We went to the venue ahead of everyone else to check out the sound system.  Bad trip kasi the field was one gigantic ant hill and so I was a prime target in my slippers. Hmm… at least may karamay na sina 8, 2ts at Enzo ng Cheese hehehe. Wala si Roel nung soundcheck namin kasi sumama siya sa motorcade so si Gilbert ang pumalo. Ang bagal ng Flaming Walls tapos naging dance yung Empty You. Pero maganda yung soundcheck. Feeling ko kuha na namin yung actual performance later that night. Pinakain kami ng masarap na fried chicken at pizza ng organizer… kaya lang, where were the drinks??? Ang tagal dumating. Medyo hindi nga sila organized, sabi nina Allan, kasi nagkaproblema yung ibang banda sa tulugan tapos sa venue mismo weird: walang portalet, wala masyadong security… may pulitika pa yatang involved dun, courtesy of the Gordon-Payumo feud.  Hay naku, buti pa yung candy, cowboy kaya walang hassle kasi wala kaming expectations!  Come the performance, we discovered that our soundcheck was of no use because the technicians had moved the settings for the showband prior to us, and they didn’t bother to put it back. Oh well. Hindi naman kami star dun, di ba? And we’re used to crap, as always. Still, we gave good head hehe :D Este… we did good ;)  After that, wala na kaming problema. Naglakad lang kami o kaya tumambay sa van.  Sina Allan at Roel nga lang, may trabaho, so yun muna inatupag nila (hehe, ows??? Biro lang. Oo naman ;).  Oh yeah. It WAS hot in the van, more so because there was absolutely no wind that night despite being near the sea, and there were no toilets nearby. Kung ano pang adventure ang ginawa namin para makaihi.  By the way, this is the perfect opportunity to shout out our thanks to the closing crew of Dunkin Donuts Subic.  Kahit closed na sila ay naawa sila samin ni Ayn at pina-CR nila kami.  Don’t worry, hindi naman kami goons, di ba? Mukha lang.  No gig sked yet excpet for Pulp Summer Slam on the 30th at Amoranto Stadium (around 6 kami tutugtog), but keep posted. I PROMISE I will, too.

      So we did the Millenia gig with Kamikazee and Cheese, as Allan said.  For me, I thought we performed well… except for my dear, old waterloo, “Felt so Fine” hehehe. But I don’t mind. Nabawi ko naman eh.  Ayn and I went home early because I didn’t want to stay out with the car. Remember, Holy Week din nung na-carnap ako.  Last night Ayn took Allan, Charles, Eric, John Paul and me to her house for a movie marathon. As usual, candyaudioline wasn’t complete; Roel and Ralph were asleep, I think.  Allan had the bright idea of letting John Paul take us all in Ayn’s pick-up for a drive to the convenience store to get drinks and food.  Damn, that was scary.  We looked so funny because we were taking pictures with the baby in front of the beer fridge and the Cheetos.  While we were driving back to the house, a school of teens on their way to the grotto were milling in front of the car.  Charles and eric, who were on the back of the pick-up, distinctly heard some of them saying, “Di ba si Vendetta [of Salbakuta] yun?” hahaha.  We watched “Splendor” which is a trite, perky, less sexy version of “Threesome”.  It was ok… kissing men are always worth endless minutes of blah comedy.  My favorite part in real life, though, was when Popular Days and Allan were making faces and shuddering when the actors kissed. What the hell is wrong with them?  They can like lesbian love… it follows that I can like gay love ;)  Anyway, the movie was cute. But I understand why I had never heard of it before.  Next, we watched “The Eye”.  That is, they watched it, I just slept through most of it or played with Tristania. I had already watched it with Ayn and Allan, and I wasn’t interested in making myself unnecessarily scared since I was going home to an empty house later that night.  Ayn wanted to watch the parts where she closed her eyes (my fault—nahawa kasi siya sa takot ko dati!).  Anyway, we finished our beers, our movie, our fundador and moved to the porch.  After a lot of begging from Allan, Ayn brought her guitar out and the guys started singing “Upside Down” by Two Minds Crack. Yecchhh.  I mean, I used to like the song, man, but that was before they started making it a staple of high school dances and pinoy mobiles.  It’s right up there with “Somebody” and “Promise” (Incidentally, John Paul insisted on singing the former, too). They sang a lot of indie tunes, too, which was nice. Allan kept changing the lyrics to make it silly—it was so funny.  He has a knack for making instant lyrics that not only sound funny but fit the melody, too. Ano kaya kung gumawa din siya ng gagong song for candy? Ay oo nga pala… tigang pala siya ngayon sa kanta…  Speaking of tigang, ang babastos talaga ng mga Knights na Nagte-Table kagabi.  All throughout, may mga hirit sila about their favorite establishment, Romeo’s, and other hints about their quest for libido satisfaction.  We decided to pack up around 4 am. The ride to Philcoa was fun because we suddenly started talking about 80’s one-hit wonders that make you really wonder why they became hits.  Examples: “Rumors” (Look at all these rumors…), “Shake body dancer” (Shake, body, body dancer…), “Nineteen six to eight”, “Brother Louie”, “Jungle life (or Night)” and “Rico Mambo”.  Alam pa ni Allan yung sayaw sa huli hehehe. Basta, we were laughing about it all on the way home. Sana ganun kasaya yung biyahe bukas sa Subic.  Yehey! Bukas na yun!

      Howdy everyone...  holy midweek but it seems like hell for me for the past couple of days... well, it  looks as if  i'll be stuck like this for the mean time...  funny, a while ago we played a gig at mellennia and it was so strange because i felt very awkward for the first time... maybe i was just tired (work sucks as always) or maybe i'm getting old... i felt i was singing out of tune for the majority of the set... well there's always a time for a comeback... come to think of it, it was supposed to be a hundred percent fun thing... i didn't experience the fun aspect of the gig that time... maybe there's something wrong with me... maybe i'm beginning to expect something from the band... or maybe this is just a pathetic excuse for not being to write a song for candyaudioline for almost a year now... it's not like me actually... in the early days, a song would come out every now and then but now, even if i excert maximum effort, i always come out with a lousy tune... i'm getting scared of realising that all the things that i did sprung out from "tsamba" or plain stupid luck... here i go again, bathing in doubt... submerged in the idea of drying up just when things are beginning to shape up to my advantage...  enough of that for the meantime... all i ever dreamt of when i was growing up was to become a very successful basketball player... but here i am, both feet on the ground shoegazing all the time...   this is what i'm feeling right this very moment taken from a soft pillow kisses song:              no more beauty, always weary... i try to smile but i end up teary... i just won't open my eyes, for sight it depresses... depresses...depresses...  i just hope that i could get off of this depressed state the soonest possible time...

      Hoy!!!  Ang tagal nating di nagkita ano? Tinatamad pa nga ako eh. Ibu-bullet ko na nga lang:  1.	Pulp pictorial—we met each other at around 8:30 am at McDonald’s EDSA. That is, Ayn and Ralph and I did.  As usual, Allan and Roel came late with Gilbert. Eloha came a little earlier than them (she CAME! Oh… Ohhhh… Ohhhhhhhh! Ops, Sir Charles, huminahon… ;). We waited a REALLY long time for Lara, who was recovering from a hangover, before we started on to Makati.  We arrived at Green Planet a few minutes after 10 and we were really proud of our punctuality.  There were about three bands who were already there, so we were thinking that we would be done right away.  The problem was that the photographer showed up really late and they let other bands have their picture taken before ours even if they came later than us. Bad trip! Ang init init sa loob tapos ang tagal-tagal naming naghintay bago kami kinuhanan. Buti na lang Roel requested that Soft Pillow and candyaudioline have their pictures taken against this cool altar in the corner. We were different from everyone else :)  Lalo kaming nagulat nung sinabi ni Vernon Go na solo shots para sa members ng candy! Kahit na 2:30 pm na kami inasikaso, sulit kasi cool yung backdrop tsaka solo pa. Ang arte namin hehe. Parang hindi indie! So after that, Ralph and Charms and I went to Ayn’s house and pigged out on their food, plus Ababu take-out. Good day.  2.	Last Friday, Ayn went to our house to CRS; except that it wasn’t functional yet, so nagkayayaan na lang ng inuman. Allan said he could come, but he didn’t.  Ralph said he’d try, but he didn’t. Roel said he was in Cebu. So it ended up being just Chris and Ayn and Me. Okay lang. Parang slow down ek-ek. Nge! Ang galing kasi ng mga kabanda namin.  3.	Practice kami sa Alberto’s dapat ng midnight nung Sunday.  Allan was already practicing inside Mang Sam’s with SPK.  Wala pa si Roel ng 1:30 nung lumabas yung SPK. They called him up and it turns out he was asleep! Siya pa yung nagyaya ng practice.  We called it off kasi tinamad na rin kami. Kumain na lang kami sa Pares Place kina Ralph.  Bad trip kasi ubos na yung pares. Order kami ni Chris ng bulalo. Yakkeee. Will   never do that again.  4.	Monday, April 14—it was our Mayric’s night along with Soapdish and Blue Ketchup.  The whole day I kept hearing the plug for our gig on NU at natuwa ako. I thought some people would actually show up.  That afternoon, I took care of graduation clearance at UP, which entailed walking from one building to another.  I think I got heat exhaustion because I became so sleepy and nauseated.  I actually didn’t wake up in time for Ayn’s arrival.  I had to rush and put on a bra, etc…. haha. (Buti nga nakapagbra pa!).  Ang sakit ng ulo ko nun.  Chris bought a pack of cigs at the Ministop in Espana and filled the plastic with ice.  I had a makeshift ice pack! It helped me recover enough to perform. Wala masyadong tao.  Binaboy ko pa yung “felt so fine”, as usual. Pero ok naman as a whole.  Si Roel pumapalya na naman.  Sabi ba naman niya samin ni Ayn, “Uy, practice uli tayo… pumapangit na naman tayo eh!”  Nagtinginan kami ni Ayn. Sabay pa kami eh: “Ikaw lang yun, no!” Haha. Si Jeff ng Soapdish, tuwng tuwa; kinanta niya yung start ng “Pretend We’re Smart” tsaka ginitara yung intro ng “Better View”. Tawanan kami nina Ralph. Ayaw nilang lumabas after that kasi wala daw silang pera. Nag Una Sikat Pares na lang kami nina Chris at Ayn. Sarap.  Tonight, we’re going to be fronting for Kamikazee at Millenia. Punta kayo. On the 19th, we’ll be at Subic with all the Backbeat Bands. CRS muna si Ayn tapos kain kami sa Ababu.

      Kakapagusap lang namin ni Allan kanina sa phone. I guess he was bored—well, I was, too! Hooray! Blogger is fixed! Tuloy ang ligaya sa pagpopost…  Bukas na nga lang kami magmomovie marathon. Ayn texted me a while ago, asking for the number of the anonymous texter from Thursday evening because she had also received an anonymous text.  I couldn’t really reply because I had no load so I asked Allan to text her for me that I had erased the number already (wala namang kuwenta yung nagtext sakin, just wanted to pick me up :P… sinabi na ngang may boyfriend na ako eh). Buti pa yung isang guy na galing all the way from Sta. Rosa—mabuhay ka, dude! We really appreciate that.  Super bored today.  That was all Allan and I talked about really… plus fear of plane crashes and pictorials hehehehe. Anyway, looking forward to tomorrow’s couch potato trip with the band.

      hi!   (eto na po selena, magpopost na po ako)  seems like you've said it all...  well, here's but a few updates regarding candyaudioline...  i think our gig this april 14 at Mayrics will push thru as scheduled...PNE management might take the 21st (which we might also graze) instead of the 14th. aside from that, we might also play on the 16 at milenya again supporting KAMIKAZEE and CHEESE... We'll sure miss buzz night which will be on the 12th... we're all looking forward to the summer slam gig this april 30...  my thoughts on the interview: well i'm quite happy that we're through with it... it went really well with all of us giving our own insights and answers concerning the band and the scene that it represents... it was fun actually, in fact we had loads of laughs that my nape got stiff most of the time... although i find interviews a bit annoying, that one was quite enjoyable... maybe because my bandmates were more talkative than what i've expected or maybe because we felt a bit comfortable having joey as the one interviewing us...  oh well, hope it turns out just fine and would be instrumental in making people understand us a little more... i also wish that some of my "legitimate" peers in the indie scene get a chance to be interviewed so as to give assertion to the claims that we (specially i) gave out...     MILLENIA GIG:  we did a total of 15 songs that night! it was like practice (meaning, FUN). at first we were - especially me a bit surprised to see people inside the venue... as usual, we did or own thing in offensively loud fashion. honestly i tend to feel more confident when someone from the sound system starts begging us to turn our guitars down. i also enjoyed seeing these two guys in front and someone from the middle bobbing their heads to our songs... i got to talk to one of them and  he  said that he came all the way from sta rosa laguna just to see us... i was so flattered... thanks sir! the next time we see each other i'll give   youa copy of the cd. the only problem is that i don't remember what he looked like because i got too shy to look at him... that is how i react when praised - i get shy! by the way, nagkabudget kami kagabi. hehehe ayun diretso kainan agad. panalo talaga yung dinuguan!!!  it was also there where i told them my plans regarding the EP... it's going to be released but in a low cost manner... hopelly by end of april or middle of  may we'll be touring behind it!!!  yun lang... i'm depressed again!

      Hold on! Baka malipat daw ang gig naming sa Mayric’s to another date because Parokya ni Edgar might take that slot.  Tsaka may bago na pala: “Magsuot ka ng mao-onnnggg…” :D  If you’re reading this post, it must mean that blogger has fixed itself and that the world will be happy again.  I really hate the fact that I’ve written so much already and it can’t even be published. Of course, Allan is probably thinking right now that I’m such a lazy bum for not updating again when I finally have all the time in the world. Well, for everyone’s information, I’m writing this at 4 pm, April 4.  Last night, Joey from PULP magazine interviewed us at the Seventy-seven café on Hemady St.  I could hardly keep my mind on the interview because it was soooo hot and I felt so stuffy sitting there even if it was sort of open-air.  The bad part was that somebody had turned on the ceiling fan above us—and we still weren’t feeling any air!  I checked to see if the setting was too low.  It turned out that no matter how close I got to the blades, I felt nothing.  Probably the blades were put on the wrong way.  It was frustrating to feel sweat flowing in rivulets down my back knowing that an almost fully functional ceiling fan was running right on top of us.  Imagine how Ayn felt in her long, black dress!  Joey ordered us some beer while we waited for Allan to arrive.  At first, it was only Roel who was talking to him… the rest of us were just keeping quiet, doing our own things.  I guess we were nervous.  He must have thought we were a bunch of snobs.  Then Allan came and everyone visibly relaxed.  As I said before, we were anxious about what we were going to be saying at that interview, and somehow the presence of wise, OLD Allan was reassuring.  Hmmm… how did it go? Well, I can only recall certain moments off the top of my head.  Of course he asked what our idea of “indie” was.  Allan gave this brief history lesson, which I’m sure even we appreciated.  So Allan set it straight, but what the interviewer wanted to know was whether we would sometimes shy away from using the word “indie” when telling people what we play. I admitted that I did at first, because I knew people thought it had the same connotation as “alternative”.  But then I realized that it really is a term for a certain type of music and that we should use it because that’s what we are.  I told him that I thought people who scoffed at “indie” are as bad as the people who glory in it.  Basically, we just told him that we were just a bunch of friends in a band playing a certain kind of music.  He asked us how we would explain our music to a layman.  We quoted a line from Allan’s mock profile: “It’s like listening to The Carpenters on the deck of an aircraft carrier while watching fighter planes land and take-off all at the same time.”  Basta… yun lang naman yun… we hang out and perform!  Some memorable parts:  ·	He asked us who were our worst critics and what the worst criticism we got was. Ayn answered right away, “Sinabi nilang tunog-Sandwich kami.”  All of us were, “Si Ayn yung nagsabi niyan ha!”  Natakot nga si Allan kasi sabi niya pala-away yung ibang sagot ni Ayn.  Pero ok lang yun… sabi nga niya when asked how we react to critics, “We don’t care what they think at all.”  To he first question, Allan replied that Purists tended to disown us, and it hurts since we’re from the same scene, but it’s ok. Ganun daw talaga eh. ·	He commented that he and his colleagues were often wary of interviewing indie bands because these bands usually have a certain untouchable attitude.  He asked us if this was an effort we were making to talk to him and make him feel comfortable with us. No! We’re really this weird and jolly when we’re together and with some people.  And the fact that we’re a hodgepodge of people with different interests in music means that we really have to be open-minded. Shy lang talaga kami kaya hindi kami masyadong nakikihalubilo sa ibang banda. If you don’t approach us, we don’t approach you.  Sabi ni Allan ayaw lang daw niya sa mga nagbabandwagon—nakakainsulto daw kasi sa mga taong sampung taon na nila ginagawa ang “indie”. ·	Asked what mainstream favorites we have individually: I said Sarah Mclachlan, Radiohead, Third eye Blind; Ayn said Matilda, PM Dawn; Ralph said dati Slapshock tsaka Parokya; Allan said Moonstar and Hammilan; Roel said something I didn’t really know hehehe.   Basta… di naman kami maarte. Masaya lang kaming kumain at tumugtog! Sa Tuesday na pala yung pictorial for the write-up.  So we went to Millenia for our 1 hour set. Ok pala yung lugar… parang inca burial chamber hehehe.  Naingayan sila samin sobra, pero ok lang… ganun talaga kami eh.  After, nagtrip kaming mag picture-taking around the venue kasi ang weird ng architecture. Nakakatawa yung mga pose namin!   Hinatid muna naming si Charms pauwi and then we went to that Pares Place near Ralph’s for a cheap food trip. Ok nga dun eh. Ang linis tsaka masarap. I think we’ll be going there more often.  We’ll probably move the movie marathon to Saturday or Sunday.  Hope this entry gets published! Oh yeah… if this entry reads weirdly, it’s because my space bar is busted and I’m typing this on Word (all “namin”s automatically become “naming” and I might have missed some.

      After watching a free German film at the UP Film Center (which actually turned out to be more Turkish than German), Ayn and Chris and I were notified by Allan that we were to practice last night.  The next day (today) is for an interview with PULP magazine about the indie music scene and about ourselves.  Plus, we are to head on to Millenia at Kamuning to have a one-hour set.  So Ayn and I were talking last night about the PULP interview and what it was to entail.  She was told that they may have a concept pictorial for us on Tuesday—what sort of concept would that be? I’ve seen PULP pictures… Would they make Ayn and me dress up as dominatrices and strip Allan, Roel and Ralph naked under our stiletto heeled boots? I don’t know… I know that not all PULP pictorials turn out that way, but hey… they probably like the notoriety.  Mostly, Ayn and I were concerned about the interview itself. What to say, what to say? Neither of us were aficionados of the indie scene… and that is what the interview is supposed to be all about, isn’t it?  Of course, we didn’t want Allan to do all the talking—and he doesn’t want that either.  He just told us that we should answer as honestly as possible… what we know about indie, however minute it is.  Anyway, there will still be questions about the band itself, which we know very well, of course.  I guess it’s just intimidating.  I mean… it is rather exciting for us to be in print, but I somehow prefer the obscurity.  And of course, I don’t want to say anything wrong.  Anyway, we had a good practice session last night.  I was very relaxed for one, having a beer to warm my insides in that cold room and sitting down on the couch just enjoying… as usual, everyone else sounded fantastic, barring the occasional slip of the fingers.  We just wanted to refresh our memories, especially since we’ll have to take from the early songs to fill up the one-hour set tonight.  Everyone was broke so we couldn’t go out to eat or do anything. We dropped Ralph off at home and took Allan to Loft Katipunan to meet someone for business.  It was funky because we actually got a complimentary bucket of San Mig Light… so kahit walang pera tuloy ang ligaya. We lingered there a bit and talked.  It was a pity that it was already too early in the morning to stay on ‘cause we had a couple of laughs (what with me and Roel and Ayn and Allan cooped up together, with special participation of beer and Chris).  Anyway, we went home and promised to be on time for the interview tonight. We might also try for another movie marathon, if we’re not too tired.  Anyway, watch out for PULP magazine’s May issue… we might be there or somewhere.  Actually, Allan says me and him got a little pic in this month’s issue for Metallurgica. Haha. Pati sa Summer Slam pic ganun ang suot ko. Yarks.  Kita tayo sa Millenia Kamuning tonight? Tsaka wag kalimutan ang 14th sa Mayric’s kasama ang Soapdish at Blue Ketchup.

      Hello everyone! I sound pretty chipper today, don’t I? Yep. You’ve guessed it. I’ve finished my thesis and now I’m free to keep posting here once again. Woohoo!  Well, this is actually a little late.  We played last Monday night at Mayric’s, opening for Moonstar 88 and Parokya ni Edgar.  It was my birthday but I didn’t have a single cent to treat my poor bandmates. Sigh. Ayn kept hinting about stuff: “Selena, Starbucks tayo” or “Selena ang sarap sigurong magsisig ngayon”… kasama pa yung hirit ni Gilbert na “Happy birthday, Mister Kebab”. Shucks. I felt like a rat. It hurts to not have money. But I’m sure they understood.  We had a sucky set actually. Ralph’s cable kept giving out on him and I… well, I just didn’t feel like singing that night. To tell the truth, I was feeling very depressed, what with my financial situation and feeling old and not being able to march at my graduation ceremonies and other petty shit like that. I almost wrote a song about it *gasp!*… that was how fucked up I was that night (you can imagine how Allan feels all the time hehehe).  While I was singing I felt like the audience could see through me, that they could sense I wasn’t really performing for them or making much of an effort, that I was tired. I guess it contributed to the suckiness. Charmaine said I was good and loud though. Well, at least I didn’t let the band down too much.  So we finished early and we hung out in front of Mayric’s for a while. Allan showed us this mock profile he made of the band and we kept laughing. It’s really funny. Maybe we can post it here sometime. Of course, ehem, I’ll have to proofread it a bit. Ayn suggested that we put it in the inlay for the album… something like a background that you can’t see if you don’t look very closely. Interesting idea… provided that the album actually gets produced.  Later that night, Ralph and Charmaine left because they were so sleepy and Ayn went with Michelle to meet some people (maybe a certain brother of someone’s boyfriend who we thought was cute at Metallurgica?). I decided to stay with Allan and Roel. I was really down and I didn’t want to go home. Si Chris kasi eh, bad trip. Anyway, Allan ordered some lovely chicharon bulaklak and beers for us. By the time Parokya was singing “Gising Na” and all those other slow songs, I was pleasantly buzzed and starting to cheer up.  Allan invited Dindin and Buhawi to partake of our chicharon bulaklak when they came down to rest.  He told them that it was my birthday and Buwi said, “Talaga? Happy birthday!” and shook my hand. Dindin did the same.  Buwi suddenly said, “Pakiss naman” and I said sige so we kissed each other’s cheeks. I turned to Dindin and said, “Ikaw di mo pa ko kinikiss” and so he brought down his cheek to me but instead I kissed him. And I suddenly realized how funny it all was and he said, “Teka parang mali yun ah!” and we all cracked up around the table. That was really funky.  I know how this sounds so cliché but I really felt it at the time.  A year or two ago, I would have been ecstatic for Buwi and Dindin to have kissed my cheek but now it’s just funny because we see them so often. So cliché when people start feeling that way, but I did. I suddenly realized how lucky I was to be in that position. Weird. And I guess that’s how sina Led and Bird of Kamikazee feel, too.  Anyway, that isn’t candy stuff anymore, but I just wanted to say that I really am thankful for candyaudioline because it’s absolutely great to be a member. We’re at that wonderful stage of popularity limbo, where you’re famous enough to be recognized for your musicianship but not enough to be bothered by screaming hordes of fans everyday. There’s no pressure to be in it, but you get all the perks. You have great friends and a great venue for catharsis.  Updates: we might have a semi-regular gig at Mayric’s on the 14th with Blue Ketchup and Soapdish. Buzz Nite is on the 12th although we won’t be playing there because Allan is somewhere else… still, it would be good of you guys to support the indie scene.  Speaking of Soapdish, Jeff had an interesting time that night with his beer.  The Parokya sethad finished and only Buwi was left onstage.  Roel was picking up stuff but he decided to jam with Buwi and they started playing jazz rhythms. For a while it was doing pretty good… Buwi sounded different and Roel sounded groovy.  Then Jeff and another Soapdish guy climbed onstage and added guitars. It was so funny beause everyone was obviously happily drunk, bu they still sounded cool. Then Buwi started repeating himself and Roel couldn’t do anything except rap beats. Jeff had to surrender his guitar to the other guy, but he grabbed a mic and attempted to help Buwi out with the vocals.  The problem was that everytime Jeff was about to sing, Buwi belt out once more and he would have to wait again. Finally Jeff was able to sing… he sang, “You don’t see me for so lo-onggg…” ala Francis Magalona circa “Gotta Let You Know”. So it suddenly turned into a full-fledged rap thing complete with “Yeah” and “1-2-3” and stuff like that.  Wewere laughing so hard at our table. Gilbert would sing, “Bigyan mo ko ng talo-ong” and Allan would answer with a “Di bagay sayo’ng baro-ong”. Oh well.  Allan and I decided to eat at Mister Kebab after that. Sumabay kami kay Popo of Moonstar and Jeff and his bandmate would sidle up to our car at stoplights and taunt us. He was even waving his shoe out the window. Sigh, to be drunk like that again…

      Text mo Selena sila Allan and Roel kasi sila naman ang madalas busy. Ako andito lang, working on some film negatives. Kung hindi puede sila Allan, if you want tayo nalang ang mag gate crash kina Ralph. Bili tayo drinks and food nalang. Miss ko narin kayo sobra. Sana may TV kina Ralph. Ok rin na andun tayo, we can work on some of the missing links on the website (like lyrics and profile)... Astig yung site. Henyo si Ralph. Buti nalang mga kabanda ko puro henyo. Though pinag iisipan ko pa kung  kasama si Roel dun. Harhar.   Methink, yung "glorifying" sounded ok naman. You glorify something, you don't "glory" something. Either that, or paling lang talaga ang grammar ko. Hahaha.

      Yellow! I am well! I am alive! Just checked out of the hospital this noon. Was confined for a severe asthmatic attack and blood infection. Scary-sounding, huh? Well.  Last Friday, when I went to Davao, I met Allan at SM and he finally gave me a copy of the PULP article. It was good. I just hate that part about my quote¡K I sounded quite ditzy and used the word ¡§glorifying¡¨ instead of ¡§glorying¡¨, which is more correct. Anyway, I was sooooooo happy to see Allan in Davao. I was really jumping for joy. That¡¦s how much I missed my Manila connections. What was so great was that he also gave me my own copy of the final mix of the ¡§An Empty You¡¨ EP. Yahoo. I was no longer disconnected from my candy roots. It was like rain to my parched earth.  Tomorrow, I am heading back to Manila. Finally, I will see everyone I love. I texted candy the news and they all said yehey. Except for Roel. He said, ¡§O talaga? Sino ka ba?¡¨ Grabe sobra akong nahurt dun. Sinabi ko sa kanya. He called me and said sorry and asked how I was and stuff. It was actually nice to chika with him again. The call erased all the bad blood his text created hehehe. Sana nga may practice sa Sunday, gaya ng sabi niya.  I just had an idea, candy. Kund hindi mag-work out yung paglabas natin ng EP sa Manila at sobrang kupal na kupal na yung mga tao satin, why don¡¦t we just pack our bags and move to Davao City? ƒº Okay dun¡K hindi nagbabangayan yung mga artists. Maraming open-minded dun... AT MAS MURA ANG COST OF LIVING, ERGO, MAS MURANG MAGPALABAS NG DISENTENG EP. Yung pinsan ko kasi vocalist ng isang reggae group dun tapos kakalabas lang nila ng EP... 6k tops yung inambag nila for everything. shet.  a oo... maraming beach at resort dun hehehe...  wow ayn... ok lang yun na ikaw yung nakalagay dun sa pulpcommunity. ikaw naman ang pinakamaganda eh :) kawawa nga si ralph kasi nagmukha siyang alien. peace, ralph. nadistort kasi yung mukha mo of all things. si roel, ginawa pang cover ng feature. galing. kami ni allan, wala lang.  hey, pwede ko ba kayong kitain bukas pagdating ko? ganyan ko kayo ka-miss. love you.

      Dear Diary,   I bumped into AJ Domingo (ex-SPK/Colour Contest, etc.), in his usual brit get-up, this afternoon in AS sa UP. Nagulat naman ako at of all people, sha pa ang nakita ko sa school. I think it's a good thing na nakakita rin ako ng tao na kilala ko outside UP. I miss that guy. It's been a long time since I last saw him. He said he has a girlfriend from UP that's why he was there. Cute. Buti naman at nagka girlfriend na sha. Sana hindi na mainitin ulo niya tulad dati. He seems ok. I'm happy for him.  Hugs and kisses,  Ayn   Bwehehehehe.

      Allan, i've downloaded SoulSeek just last night. Pardon my ignorance but I have no idea how to work it. Hindi ko talaga maintindihan. I think I might be needing some help from you. It took me months to figure out mirc, i'm going through the same thing with this one.

      Ralph pakabit ka na kasi ng internet jan sa bago niyong kulungan ni Charmaine. Para ma upload mo na ng todo yung site at madalas ka makapag update dito... Sana naman yung site natin kasing ganda nung pinakita mo samin dati dito na rejected site na ginawa mo for some company ba yun? Rejected na yun sa lagay na yun ha. I don't know much about computers and website creations pero sana ok na ok yung atin. Tipong award winning ba. Total you're THE webmaster naman diba? Sana kita sa site natin yun. At sana mag iba naman ng kulay. Alam mo bang lagi ko naaalala ang UP Maroons uniform tuwing nakikita ko ang orange and red? Tignan mo itong blog. Puede naman siguro yung ibang kulay nalang. Pero wag sana yung tipong maaalala ko naman ang Ateneo, UST at La Salle.. Purple kaya? Kung gusto niyo ng light color, lavander. Bahala ka. If you need more pictures for the site, marami ako dito. Mga three albums worth of kendi pix.   If you guys have extra money, ambagan tayo for an album, photo album i mean. I want to work on a good one including mga souvenirs natin from gigs like fliers, tickets, food stubs, naputol kong string, magazine, newspaper, online articles, buhok ni Roel, putol na drumsticks ni Roel (posible ba yun), etc. A scrapbook might work better. The one I bought for Trista, costs around 500 bucks pero good quality: Makapal, hardcover, imported, acid-free, refillable, at puede lagyan ng plastic cover every page. Pero yung plastic cover costs around 300 pesos, 10 sheets. Yun eh, if you care na gumawa tayo ng ganun. Kung mabilisan lang puede normal album nalang pero di mailalagay yung mga makakapal na bagay like strings. Yung photo album na makapal na binili ko rin for Trista costs around 1000 pesos pero refillable. Problema lang di ko alam kung saan makakakuha ng refills.  Suggestion lang: yung library mo ng live videos ng kendi, ipa transfer mo sa VCD. If possible, maglagay ka rin sa site. Kung may copies tayo ng TV appearance like UNtv and MYX, itransfer narin. Tulad ng ginawa nila manyak boys. Lagyan mo sana ng tunog sa background yung site. Intro ng empty you, chipmunks version. Yung tunog pag tinatransfer sa CD/tape yung recording sa studio. Pero kung ganun, astig yung flaming walls or felt so fine. Bahala ka narin.  Kung ok lang sa inyo ni Charmaine, jan nalang tayo mag inuman pag uwi ni Selena. Sometime this week sana kasi busy ulit ako next week for registration sa first sem. Pero malabo makasama si Trista sa inyo baka di sha makatulog. OK din kung jan, para change venue naman.  Enjoy the rainy season.  Love and Slack,  Ayn Ruth Baudelaire

      Nakauwi na si Allan ngayon. Si Selena nalang. Wednesday or Thursday daw.  Si Ralph at Charmaine nakalipat na ng bahay. Nag iinvite na punta daw tayo lahat dun.  Si Roel hindi pa nagpaparamdam. Pag magtetext saken, puro hindi sakin. Puro sa keso, kay Enzo. Labo mo chong.  Makukuha ko narin gitara ko kay Jamir ngayon. Akala ko wala ng balak ibalik. Naalala ko tuloy yung klepto issue niya sa Parokya.

      Yehey one week to go! I can't wait to be with you guys again. Ang tagal tagal na. Memorize ko na yung Kingdom Come at Lone Wolf and Cub, wala pa rin kayo. Out of mere boredom, napilitan ako magpa ID. Meron narin akong ID after four years in UP. Dahil wala kayo, natuto akong ma-excite sa mababaw na bagay.   Buti naman at magkikita kayong dalawa. Ako kahit anino ni Ralph at Roel di ko makita.   Yes Selena, it would be a bad thing to hook up with that guy or with someone like him. Whoever told you i'm into intellectual men? Haven't you noticed, I only go steady with dumb men. The dumbest men one could find in this world, to be more specific. I don't think i'd be able to stand intellectual men. Source of fight lang yon. In fact, me and him just got into a heated argument about Jean Paul Sartre's "Being and Nothingness" and its relation to his "No Exit" play. Something about me mentioning Friedrich Nietzsche's "God is Dead" in relation to Sartre's existentialist philosophy. He went on ranting about Sartre being a bourgeois and a non-pessimist if compared to other thinkers. He ranted for 30 minutes straight. To think, walang kinalaman yun sa pinag-uusapan namin. He didn't have to insult a dead guy for chrissakes. Even if Sartre were alive, I don't think he would give a rat's arse about his sentiments. He better keep his side comments to himself when I'm in the middle of trying to make a point. He just did that to show that he still knows better than me.   Oh well, sorry if I had to type this part. Matagal ko na tinatago yung galit sa nangyari na yan. Wala ako mapag sabihan.  Oi if you guys are looking for a keyboardist, I know someone who could replace Eloha. Her name is Ayn Tristania. Hehe. She's getting better with her piano skills. I'm also teaching her how to play "Can't Find a Better View" on keyboards pati "We've Been There."  Selena, you'll be surprised when you see her again. She even  knows how to operate her musical mobile now. :)  See you all next week!!  Love and Slack,  Ayn Ruth Baudelaire  "Hell is other People." -Jean Paul Sartre, NO EXIT

      hey! allan will be in Davao until Saturday morning, so I hope we'll be able to see each other before he leaves for Manila. So sorry about the delay... I really do miss everyone there and I'm starting to get slightly bored here... but I love my Lola and this is my last opportunity to hang out with her before work starts. Anyway, I just realized that my return is only a week away. Before you know it, I'm there again :) Text pa kahapon si Ralph, akala nakabalik na ako. di pa.  Ayn, would it be so bad to hook up with Canlas? hehehe... though I'm not sure if you're quite the match, if you know what I mean ;) I think the intellectual type might suit you more than you think, though. Pero siguro dapat may nipple ring siya or something funky like that. Naku nangingilala na pala si Tristania! I have to see her! I can't believe she's at that sitting-by-herself stage already... to think that's what I've been looking forward to since she was born! awww, man... this is making it harder to stay.  Kawawa naman si Allan. Sana makita ko siya sa Davao. I'll ask him to do the strut for my sister. I've been telling her all about it!  Oh, well... a week to go. Take care!

      Wow, surprised naman ako at nakapag post kayo agad. It's a bummer that you guys have to extend your vacation. Now, I'm starting to feel like blog friends nalang tayo. Boohoo. It's okay, though. I understand. I just could not stand the fact that I'll be dealing with my professors' faces until the end of the month. Can you imagine, I'm starting to have dreams about them. What could be worse than that? Sana hindi naman omen yun. Baka mamaya I'd end up married to Noel (yung pina inom ni Chris dati, Selena.). Hell no.  Grabe Allan, okay yang lugar nyo diyan ah. Dalhin mo naman kami jan minsan. Ghost hunting tayo (sabay ako ang una mag chicken out.) I'm sorry to hear what you're going through now. Ganyan din dinaan ng family ko last year. Ganun talaga eh. Don't worry pag balik mo dito, inuman tayo lahat samin.   Selena, thanks sa pasalubong. Have fun on your vacation. Pagbalik niyo dito inuman tayo. Sana nagpadala ka kay Allan ng copy ng PULP if ever magkikita kayo. Si Trista, tumangkad na lalo. She can sit by herself now. She can also stand by herself while holding on to the railings of her crib. Cute. Kaya lang she's starting to have "stranger anxiety." Just found out this evening when one of her ninongs dropped by for a visit. Nangingilala na. Kaya pagbalik mo, dalasan niyo ni Chris pagbisita.  I feel so sorry for those people na hindi sha madalas makita or never pa nakita. I predict that they won't have a welcoming greet from my daughter.  Sige, I'll be looking forward to seeing you all soon.  Love and Slack,  Ayn Ruth Baudelaire

      me, too. i miss everyone in candy, pati na rin yung mga usual extras natin like si charmaine and chris and charms and the manyak boys :) miss ko rin si tristania na siguro super laki at cute pa lalo ngayon...  i have bad news for everyone. i'm going to be returning to manila by the end of the month instead of this tuesday. i talked to allan yesterday and he regrets to say that he will also be extending his stay in surigao. oh no. i'm really sorry but my Lola has requested an extension, and we do want to spend time with her while we still can. allan has to wait for things to happen in surigao too. so i guess we'll have to just wait, too. sorry.  on a lighter note, I love that quote from darius, ayn. :D siguro kailangan na nating palitan yung title hehehe...  allan and i were trying to plan to meet while we're both in mindanao. Gusto sana naming mag-meet sa davao kaya lang sa friday pa kami pupunta dun uli and allan's plan is for tomorrow. too bad. it would have been great to see another familiar face.  i am now resigned to the fact that i may not see the article in pulp until i return to manila. things are just too ineffient in the philippines, especially here in the backwoods :D. Of course, i mean no offense. i actually like the backwood-ness of the backwoods. it's refreshing. and here in malaybalay, it's blissfully cool. thank god for the rainy season.  i miss you all. may pasalubong nako para sayo, ayn :} don't be sad.

Ang ganda ng puta. Photogenic.    Kawawa naman si Roel.  Kelan kaya tayo tutugtog ulit? I'm getting tired of my everyday routine: School-KFC-Starbucks-bahay.

      Hey! Agh! I can't wait to come home! wala pa akong nahanap na PULP sa Davao! gusto ko uling kumanta! Tristania!  Now that my frustrations are out of the way, time for some news. Just came back from Davao and I had a wonderful time there. Except for not finding any copy of PULP, I had the time of my life. We finally went to the beach and I am now all red and crispy like lechon. Maybe as fat, too. Pangit pa naman ng tan lines ko. I guess that means I won't be wearing any tank tops to gigs back in Manila.  Nagtext sakin kanina si Allan ng mga 11 am. Nasa Surigao na daw siya. Sabi niya, magkita daw kami at maghanap ng kabanda para makatugtog kami as candyaudioline dito hehehe. Sige!   We'll be back on the 20th at around 2 pm. See you then. Take care guys!  p.s. Ralph nasan na yung pic? Miss you, ayn! Di ko nakita yung star pics kasi ang aga magsara ng mga nesstands dito pag sunday.

      Ralph's party last night was so much fun. I picked them (Ralph, Chris and Charmaine) up sa Ababu inside Teacher's Village. Ralph ordered 6 ox brains, 4 charboiled liver and 5 kebabs. Meron din silang dala ni Charmaine na Black Forest cake. When the orders arrived, we went straight to Shoppersville in Katipunan to buy some beer and ice. Then we went straight to my place. After a couple of minutes, Allan and Sir Charles arrived. I prepared spaghetti and lumpia for our dinner in addition to the Ababu food and cake. Dapat magluluto rin ako ng sisig pero madami pang food. Next time nalang.   Siempre Trista celebrated the party with us. We took some of her pictures with her ninongs and ninang. Siempre nag enjoy ng todo si Charmaine at Chris. Sayang wala si Selena :(  Tinignan rin nila yung May issue ng PULP, yung mga pictures sa PULP Summer Slam 3 at sa last gig sa Millenia. Pati rin pala yung Philippine STAR newspaper kahapon kung saan may picture kami ni Allan (gig sa PSS3).  Chris, Charmaine, Sir Charles, Trista and I left my place for a while to drop by KAFE, Katipunan where we picked up Charms. Matilda had a gig there with Comet's Tale, Twisted Halo, and other bands. Pag baba namin, pinagkaguluhan si Trista agad. Matilda even took some pictures with her. Tuwa naman si mommy. Si Jovan (Matilda manager), ayaw bitiwan si Trista. Imagine, we were able to get inside the venue for free because of Trista :) Kahit mga taong di ko kilala, pinang gigigilan anak ko. I just realized, first gig pala ni Trista yun. She enjoyed the experience a lot. I can't wait to bring her to Candyaudioline gigs soon! Si Chris nga pinipilit na ako na dalhin na sha sa gigs.Sha daw mag aalaga pag tumutugtog na kami. Siempre nag object si Charmaine at sha lang daw ang mag aalaga kay Trista pag gigs. Hehe. Kelangan ko muna bumili ng earplugs. Like what Kim and Thurston of Sonic Youth made their daughter wear during their gigs when she was still a baby. Si Jovi (Matilda drummer), sinasabihan na si Trista na sha ang magtuturo ng drums sa kanya. That would be great :) Malapit na kami puede mag jam ni Trista. Need to buy her own drumset soon.  When we got back here with Charms, tuloy ulit ligaya. Dami uli cuentuhan. Topic for the night si Roel. Hehehe. Wala, absent kasi eh. As usual. Funny rin yung kinuwento ni Allan about Biboy and 8 (of Cheese) na nahuli niyang pumupunta rin pala sa Romeo's. Nahuli daw niya na kumakanta sa videoke ng "Ocean Deep." Hot spot na pala ang Romeo's ngayon. Isa pang funny story ni Allan yung sinabihan ni GottDott si Richard Tan ng, "Cool down, piggy-boy." Hahaha.  I showed them Trista's album na inaayos ko parin ngayon. Nagulat sila na indie yung designs na ginawa ko. Allan was expecting something dark. Well, it's not mine. Kay Trista yun eh saka pang baby so better pag indie yung design nun. Astig nga eh. Sana matapos ko na, tambak na ang mga pictures ni Trista. Siguro lampas 500 na lahat. Hirap kasi gawin yung designs. It took me more than 5 hours to work on just 2 pages. Mag isa lang kasi akong gumagawa.  Tinawagan rin namin si Anna (Candyaudioline's ex-vocalist who's in Canada now with her baby). She texted me first to greet me a happy mother's day (ang dami kong overseas text that day ah), then we decided to call her up. Kamustahan lang. We miss her so much.  The night ended around 2 am. It could have lasted a bit longer pero may pasok kami pareho ni Chris ng maaga at si Charms may curfew. Si Allan tutuloy pa yata ng Surigao that same day.  Naki gamit pala sila ng net to check this blog. Ralph, di parin lumalabas yung Millenia solo gig natin dito. Allan, baka di mo pinapublish pa yung mga na-post mo dito dati.  Selena, bilisan mo pagbalik dito ha. We miss you a lot. Pati si Trista.

      Yes... I think it would be better if you read the article yourself. Actually sa lagay na yon, my description wasn't that accurate still. I also have friends from Mindanao who are asking about the PULP May issue. Siguro in another week, baka meron na yan jan. Hassle lang kasi it might take some time before it reaches there. Tignan mo nga sa Odyssey sa SM Fairview wala pa. Ang taray pa nung babae sa cashier nung tinanong ko. Balak pako isnabin. She had this look na parang, "dimo ba nakikita na wala." Nakakainis. Iniwan siguro ng boyfriend yun. What an arse.  I especially liked Selena's line in the article regarding the term indie that went like, "I didn't really like the term, but then I guess that scoffing at the term is just as bad as glorifying in it." I totally agree with that. The same thing applies for any other term that defines a certain genre or subculture. That certainly was a line that need not be long, but  covers a lot in relation to heated debates on "indie."   I also liked Joey's line which ended the article, "even though their sound may be uncommon in an industry saturated with mediocrity, they still are, after all, very much everyday people."  It is common knowledge that Joey has this reputation for dissing certain bands (or places--like Millenia. Heheheh) in his articles in PULP. It surprises me that he didn't do just that with us. I say that's flattering enough.

      damn, damn, damn this shit to hell!!! I am so far away from everythiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing! get me a PULP issue please!  sigh. I guess we'll have to wait until tomorrow. at least we'll be going to Davao to visit some relatives... there must be an Odyssey outlet at the SM there! I can't take all the waiting. I know that Ayn already told everything, but nothing beats reading it for myself. My only fear is that even SM Davao won't have it this early yet. Oh well... must wait then.  Sayang di ako nakasama sa Millenia gig. Matagal na akong hindi nakakaplay sa mala-Buzz Nite na tugtugan, or kung tumugtog man ako, wala namang tao sa mga times na yun. Buti pa yung kinuwento mo, Ayn, okay yung reaction ng iba sa inyo. I'm so happy for you guys, though.  Boo. I won't be there for Ralph's birthday, either. I hope you have fun. I miss Tristania so much, too, and you're all going to get to see her. Phooey. Isolation bites. (Don't forget to bring Chris with you guys! ;)  Anyway, if Ayn thinks the article was fair, I'm sure it really is. Thanks, Joey. We're glad you weren't too scared about interviewing us and we appreciated the beer a lot ;} We hope this article opens a lot of people's minds and and hearts to us. (naks... cheese)  Nothing much happening to me related to Candy. Just pining away for some info. Happy Mothers' Day, Ayn! :D Happy Birthday, Ralph! :D

      I now regret the fact that I don't live in the midst of our civilization.* I guess it's high time for me and Trista to move out of this place and transfer to some pad (condo?) somewhere in Makati.  Selena and Ralph texted me this afternoon about PULP's May issue. Ralph said that Denise (of PULP) texted him that some mag stalls already have the said issue. Having learned that, I rushed back to SM Fairview, hoping that the Odyssey record bar already has it. But NOOOOO. I couldn't stand the fact that it's already out and I still don't have it so I decided to go straight to Robinson's Galleria along EDSA. It was already 6pm (rush hour) pero tumuloy parin ako. Fuck Manila traffic! It took me an hour to get there, and another hour to get back to Fairview. When I finally had a glimpse of Galleria's big "70% sale off" billboard, I had the feeling that I was about to enter paradise.  Hinihingal ako pagdating sa loob. When I finally reached this mag stall at one corner and saw PULP's  May issue, I could imagine hearing Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" playing at the background.. At loooong last!!!!!  So, about the article... To answer Selena's question which she posted a few entries back--well, I'd like to think that it was a fair portrayal of the band. Joey had a good impression of us...I guess. And to think that I felt so guilty after I asked him to treat us with a round of drinks when we just arrived. I was thinking then, "'Taina, ba't ko ginawa yun. Bad image. Baka akala feeling rakstars tayo. Kapal ng mukha ko." Good thing, if ever na bad trip sha nun, hindi naman nag reflect sa article. Pero ok naman lang yata sa kanya, judging sa reaction niya that time. Saka nginitian naman niya ako nun Summer Slam. Ah ewan, basta yun.  The candyaudioline article covered two whole pages. Same thing with SPK. As expected, dinistort nga yung pictures to achieve a certain effect na parang hanging curtains or something. I noticed some typos here and there (halatang minadali yung issue). We all know that our interview took some time so don't be surprised kung bakit ang daming nawala sa article na pinagusapan natin noon sa Seventy-seven. Major editing. Title nung article,   candyaudioline: sticking to the sound (and the persian food)  . Obviously, binigyan ng emphasis yung Kebab obsession natin (na hindi na ngayon). Nagkamali lang si Joey ng nilagay. Instead of Mister Kabab, akala niya Prince Kebab yung pinupuntahan natin. Okay lang, common naman na ngayon yung mga pumupunta ng Mister Kabab lalo na sa eksena. Look at the Boldstar write-up sa April issue.   Yung point-of-view ni Allan regarding the term "indie," claro naman. I think, Joey got the idea of what Allan and the rest of us were trying to say. Joey was able to give out the impression na hindi lang mga taga labas ng Buzznite scene ang tumitira satin, kundi pati narin yung mga taga loob. That's fair enough. Some people think, Buzznite people (that includes us) are so elitist to the point that the whole music scene is starting to seem like a "we-think-we're-indie-bec-we're-independent-period vs. Buzznite bands" scenario. Or vice-versa. At least dun sa article, napakita na this is not the case when it comes to Candyaudioline.  Ano pa ba masasabi ko? Ayun, cute tayo sa pictures. And no, we're not on the cover ok. Linkin' Park yung andun. Though our name was mentioned somewhere on the cover alongside SPK, Copper Pop Thrill, Narda, and some of the other Bands who were with us during the photo shoot at the Green Planet.. Joey was able to tame down some of my answers: the one where I mentioned Sandwich and the "We don't need their opinion" line. Basta na neutralize yung pagka angas natin at nagmukha tayong mga santito't santita. Parang maangas pero down to earth (malabo ba?). Parang ahas na bungal (sige na corny nako).  Yun lang.    *In tagalog, kinamumuhian ko na ang malupit na katotohanan na hindi ako nakatira sa kalagitnaan ng sibilisasyon ng Kamaynilaan.

      I am now starting to believe that the May issue will never come out.   Hanggang ngayon wala parin akong mahanap. Nationwide delivery pala Roel, ha. Hmph! Hay nako yan si Roel, siya rin yung pumalpak nung Thursday night. Sa intro pa ng Empty You. Thursday is an unlucky day I know, pero sana di mo ginawa yun. Obvious na obvious. May sabit rin ako sa simula ng Felt So Fine at Better View pero di gaanong obvious naman.  Anyway, I forgot to post that Ralph will be celebrating his birthday tomorrow night at my place. Everyone is invited. It's a good thing that he will be celebrating his birthday here so Trista could be present (Happy boitday, ninong). I'm sure we will all have fun.  I've developed the Millenia pictures. Ralph has so many good shots. I would have wanted to keep them all but I just decided to give some of them to Ralph as a gift. I was at the mall this morning. I couldn't think of any other gift to give him. I don't have money for a brand new guitar, okay. So, pictures nalang muna.  Dahil sa sobrang dami ng mga kuha ni Sir Charles (di na nga kasha sa album lahat), I'm selling some of the pictures for 5 pesos each. Hehehehe.

      I'm glad I didn't screw things up last night. We had a great gig even though I was aware that there was something missing...Selena. The set was great but it could have been more perfect if Selena was there.  I'm not sure if I could narrate things that happened last night in detail, like how Selena does it, but I'll try. Here goes...  It was already around 9pm and I haven't left my room yet. I promised Charms that I'll be picking her up as early as 9.30 pm and I promised Allan that I'll be there before ten. It was all because of my freakin' black satin slip. It took me more than an hour to realize that it was hopeless to find it since 98% of my clothing are black and my room has dim lighting and that it was night time. It was already around 9.45 pm when I decided to wear something else. I passed by a store near the Starbucks in Katipunan to buy my supply of clove cigarettes then I went straight to Visayas Ave. to pick up Charms. We arrived in Millenia around 10.30, I think. We had a hard time parking the van in the middle of two cars infront of the venue. When we got off the ride, we were welcomed by the presence of Allan and the Popular "manyak" Days who were all sitting outside.   Once I got inside the venue, I went straight to the bar to get our free beers. We sat with Eloha and Popoy and Roel, and chatted a bit. Roel said something like, "Ayn, ang payat payat mo ngayon. Nag-shashabu ka ba? Ikaw ha, isusumbong kita kay mommy." I was flattered and at the same time, I was insulted. I guess that's the way it is with Roel, he would flatter you and the next moment he'll insult you. Of course, I told him that I'm not into any of those shite especially now that I have a daughter to think about. All of my money are going to Tristania. Well, okay--almost all of my money.  Anyway, Downboydown played first. As usual, Nico is drunk. That works for him and they did a good set. While they were still playing, I went back to the bar to have some red wine. Charms and I chatted some more and before I knew it, it was time for Candyaudioline's set. I was so nervous and had no idea what would come out of our set. Earlier that night, Ralph, Allan and I were arguing which songs, we're gonna play. Finally, we settled for "My Silverchair," "Nothing Much to Lose," "Felt so Fine," "Can't Find a Better View," and "An Empty You." Much to our surprise, we did real well. Everyone was cheering and Sir Charles was taking our pictures. Naubos niya yung buong film sa set lang namin. The audience were so responsive that he also took their pictures. Nakakabitin nga lang that we only did five songs. We would've been able to play more songs kung andun lang sana si Selena. Also, kung nagustuhan kami ng mga tao sa lagay na yon, what more if Selena's singing.  It's flattering to see people being really attentive to us. It's been a long time since we had this kind of crowd. For the past gigs we've been playing with commercially established Backbeat bands who has an audience who cares only for the likes of Cheese and PnE. This time, it's the "indie" people who could at least understand what we're doing. There was even this one guy with afro-like hair at the corner near the speakers at the side of the stage who was so into our music that he was doing air guitars and all during our set. As in feel na feel niya todo.   When we were finally done with our set, people were saying that we should play more. Eh wala eh, wala kasi si Selena. Kami rin naman nabitin. Sayang talaga.   Spring Boutique went on next with their tweepop acoustic set. Popular Days played after them. Siempre puro asar na naman sa mga manyak boys. Soft Pillow Kisses played last. They had a really long set (8 songs I think. Maybe even more).  To end the night, I had a glass of margarita. They ran out of red wine already. Bummer. And I thought I'm not supposed to get drunk. I bumped into a lot of Buzznite/ABG's/K8 people whom I haven't seen for a long time. It was nice. It felt like the "old" Buzznite days. I met old friends like Arnel (of Skies of Ember), Liarns, Tiffany, Jen, Jefkid and many more. We all had a talk about our lives and how we've all been doing. They're all excited about my baby. Nakakatawa kasi si Nico (of Downboydown) kinamusta yung baby ko, thinking that I haven't given birth yet. Si Jefkid naman, pinagpipilitan na baby daw namin si Tristania at tinatanong kung pareho parin sila ng buhok. Gawd, he was so drunk that night. Baka may maniwala sa mga sinasabi niya.  Everyone else was telling me that they really liked Candyaudioline's set. They said that we sound different now but they like the change we had. It was for the better, according to them. I told them, if they liked what they heard, wait till they hear us again with our vocalist. She's the best vocalist we've had. Totoo naman eh. They're all looking forward to that.  Charms and I left Millenia around 2 am. The night was so great, I forgot that I was supposed to be home earlier to work on a paper. Since I got home real late and drunk, I wasn't able to work on it. Buti nalang, puede pa mag pass ng paper sa Monday. At least I was still able to get up just in time for my early class.  Whew.

      Earlier, when I was trying to get in on our blog's site, some other site came up. Nagulat ako kasi medio socio-political yung nakalagay sa main page. I checked the address again, tama naman. Akala ko biglang na Twilight Zone si Selena at biglang mga yun yung nakalagay sa main page natin. I tried getting in our blog site again tapos lumabas na yung totoo. Ako pala yung na Twilight Zone. Ang labo.   I just woke up at medio inaantok pa. I need to have dinner first before I leave my place and pick Charms up. Pareho kami may dysmenorhea (did I get the spelling right?). You know, it's that time of the month. I bet, pareho kami mainit ulo mamaya.  This afternoon, Allan texted. Tinatanong kung kakanta ako. He thought I have plans of singing for tonight because I texted him that I still need to grab a few drinks before we play. How I wish na kaya ko na kumanta ngayon. Hindi pa ako ganun ka confident, saka wala pang practice, saka ibig sabihin nun may extra bayad ako. Hindi naman ako makakapag lasing (kung saan mapupunta bayad ko) ng  todo tonight because I need to go to UP real early tomorrow.  Last night, nagulat ako sila Allan pumunta pala sa birthday ni Mich. Di man lang nagsabi. Di tuloy ako nakadaan. Soft Pillow Kisses daw pinatugtog niya, instead of us. May sakit si Ralph kasi. Tanong ng tanong si Mich kung bakit di ako pumunta. Sabi ko nalang, hindi kasi nag confirm si Allan so I decided to work on a paper. Si Roel nagtext naman na papunta na and that was around 1 am. As if naman makakahabol pa ako ng ganung oras.  I'm so nervous about tonight. Feeling ko hindi ko na mashado alam yung basslines. Last time we played, pasmado ako and I think I didn't really play that well as I usually do. Ewan ko kung dahil lang din sa kaba dahil maraming tao. I hope I won't screw things up tonight.   Oh well.

      Allan, i'm sorry about your dad, too. I had this impression you weren't that close to him, but i know it still bites. heck, it's enough to get you thinking about your own mortality, you know. Please, magpapayat ka na! boohoo! Malapit ba ang surigao sa bukidnon? text mo naman ako pag nasa mindanao ka na.  grabe, nakakainggit naman kayo, may tugtog kayo ngayon. i guess, that's what i get for going off on a sabbatical. sigh. i really miss you guys... i wasn't even able to bring my candy cd. ralph's riffs-- boohoo! ayn's bass lines-- sob! allan's rhythm section-- sniff! roel's rolls-- whimper! galingan niyo ha... but not enough to realize you can just kick me out, hehehe... ;} just joking. give them a good show.  hey. take care, guys. round trip kasi ticket ko so 20 pa talaga ako babalik. ingat kayo.

      Candy has a gig tomorrow night at Millenia with bands like Downboydown, Daydream Cycle, Spring Boutique, Popular Days and Soft Pillow Kisses. The event is dubbed as "In Between Days." As usual, biglaan ulit. But it's ok. I'll manage. I just hope that I won't get home drunk. Otherwise, I won't be able to get up just in time for my early class the next day. Nakakainis wala si Selena. This won't be the same. I'll try to bring Charms with me so I won't miss Selena that much (sappy). I was with Charms this afternoon. We met up in UP and we passed by the Kamia Dorm to bring back some stuff of her friend. She had to borrow my guitar. Gagawa daw ulit siya ng new songs for Matilda. Buti pa sila may new songs (oops nagpaparinig).  They played in Millenia yesterday night and guess who's there? Si Roel! Ano naman ginagawa kaya niya dun. It was a Last Full Show gig where bands like Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man, Fish Trio, Matilda and Twisted Halo plays. Siguro pumoporma na naman.  Siempre, pasikat na naman siya ng mga alam niya dun. Nakapasa si Maricor (Matilda violinist) sa UP Conservatory of Music recently at kung ano anong "circle of 5" na naman ang nile-lecture niya kay Maricor. Parang "american standard" sa drums kuno. He also told Charms na alam daw na niya yung content ng next issue ng PULP since may na-receive daw siyang e-mail about it. That's kind of funny since I don't think he really checks his e-mail. Look, hindi pa nga niya naco-confirm yung membership niya dito sa blog eh. Dapat siguro si Roel kumuha nalang ng Creative Writing course since ang dami niyang out-of-this-world na ideas for a fictional story. Pero mahirap din yata yun kasi parang hindi pa siya nakakakuha ng Comm 1. Damn, i'm so mean. Sanay naman na si Roel. Ganun din naman siya sakin. Pero peace parin kami.  Hey Allan, sana nga ma-release na natin yung "An Empty You" anytime soon. Para ma-experience naman na namin na magkaron ng astig at one of a kind na EP. Kahit 4-song lang. Para meron kaming bagong maipagmamayabang sa mga kagalit namin. Ehehehe. Teka, I think i'm only speaking for myself. Hehehe. Well, as they say, okay lang magmayabang basta meron ipinagmamayabang, unlike some people I know. (hint, hint)  I'm sorry to hear about your dad. Don't you worry, we're always here to cheer you up. I know you guys have always been there when I was the one who was going through hard times. Anjan kayo lahat nung namatayan rin ako, when I gave birth, and when Trista and I needed company. I'm thankful right now that even without me asking, ang dami nang mga daddy ni Trista. Pati narin mga mommy. Because of you guys, walang kulang sa buhay namin. As in wala. We couldn't ask for anything more.  So if you need anything from us, andito lang kami always.

      Hey.  Last time I checked (which was just yesterday), hindi pa lumalabas yung May issue ng PULP. I thought they were supposed to release it by first week of May? I can't wait to read it. Para akong tanga na pabalik-balik sa mall just for that issue. Now I feel like i'm one of those fanboys, or in this case fangirls.   Nakakabato na hindi nakakatugtog. Umuwi ka na kasi. I need some form of release (besides sex) from all the stress that I'm in with papers and all. Umuwi ka na kasi talaga.  Ang weirdo nga nung chick na nag-comment about wordplays no? And to think she's a graduate from CAL. She also teaches in the university, I think. I'm not sure.  BTW somebody posted a message sa clubdredd.com about us. Napanuod daw tayo sa Summer Slam. Nag reply ako, sabi ko lang salamat. I have this feeling kasi na kilala rin natin yun. Baka si Ralph.. Yung pictures natin napa develop ko na yesterday. Ganda ng mga kuha. Hindi halatang lasing tayo. Wholesome na wholesome.  Nga pala, May nanaman. Kailan ba matatapos yung "An Empty You"? May balak pa ba tayo na i-release yon o ire-record na naman natin ulit? Ang dami na natin ginastos sa Tracks ah. If money is the problem, I think it would be better if we use whatever is left in our pockets sa packaging. Mas ok na yon kesa gumastos ulit tayo for another recording na hindi rin naman pala tayo satisfied ulit (as always). Look what happened sa recording sa Pink Noise. Sayang rin yon. Kahit ano naman ang kinaganda ng recording natin, we have to admit that we still sound better playing live. So I doubt it if we can expect any of our recordings to sound as good (or better) as our live sets.   Release na natin yung "An Empty You." May mga nagtatanong na sa akin about it. Mga dalawa sila. Hehe.  Oi Selena, bakit hindi lumalabas yung mga past entries natin dito na nasa archives? Check mo, sayang mga yun. Hindi ko pa yata nababasa yung iba.  Diba malapit na birthday ni Ralph? O nananaginip lang ulit ako?   "I have dreamed of you so much that you are no longer real." -Robert Desnos

      Ack! Trapped! must... go... out... must... sing... and flop ;} hehehe  hey, Allan! Buti pa si Ayn, nagkukwento. What has been happening to candyaudioline in the past week? Has the May issue of PULP come out? What does it say? Was it a fair portrayal of the band?  I totally agree with you on the bandname subject, Ayn. And aren't all band names based on wordplay anyway? Not unless your band is named Dave Matthews Band or Cynthia Alexander Band or Paolo Santos Trio, I guess. But the rest of them are. Ang weirdo naman ng nag-comment nun. But I have to admit that I do get pissed with bandnames like DV8 and all those numbered names... but as you say, if they play well, it wouldn't matter in the end.  You know what really pisses me off? The fact that I forgot to bring all my indie compilations along with me. Boooooooo! It's a good thing I was able to grab Chris's "Death to the Pixies" album before I left Manila. I'm not a total wreck. Still a wreck, though. Somewhat.

      Salve...  Oo nga, si Charms of Matilda pala yung nakalimutan ko i-mention na kasama pa natin sa Manifesto. I'm glad she enjoyed the night. Oi Ralph, ibalik mo na yung ID ni Charms at yung kay Mike (candyaudioline crew--naks). Speaking of Charms, I'll be playing with Matilda again on the 17th sa Sta. Cruz, Laguna. Since si Allan nagpo-post ng stuff dito regarding Soft Pillow Kisses gigs, I think it's okay na i-mention ko rin dito yung sa Matilda.  In relation to Soft Pillow Kisses, there's this one egroups where a member mentioned some bands with names that she thinks suck big time. That person claimed she didn't like wordplay names and she mentioned SPK and Colour Contest in her list. Ano trip niya, names like PurpleChickens? Hehehe. Talk about confirming your bad taste on the net. :) Besides, I don't think band names matter that much as long as the band could play real good. And I think SPK and Colour Contest are great indiepop bands. To think that Laura Watling considered CC as one of her favorite bands. There are also some bands who are well-known for their great music, to the point that people don't notice anymore how their name sucks --i.e. All Natural Lemon and Lime Flavors, Skinny Puppy, etc. Oh well, some people.  Teehee.  Oh my goddess!!! Hindi ko alam na na-tape pala ni Ralph yung Bamboo incident! Shite, blackmail material. Harharhar.  Last night while I was in the middle of doing research, I was chatting with Sir Charles at the same  time. Tinanong niya, "Asan yung_______ ni Bamboo?" Sabi ko, "Ayun, nasa ilalim ng pillow ko." Hehehehe.  Selena, I love you too! Let's sleep together again. Hehehe. (Lesbos in action) We miss you so much.   Love and Slack,  Ayn Ruth

      yes, ayn you said that Ralph was there... ;)  hooray for Ayn at nakapag-post na siya ulit dito! sana ituloy na rin ni Ralph at pati na rin si Allan na marami masyado ang gawain. si roel, di na ako umaasa... hanggang ngayon ba naman, hindi niya kino-confirm ang pagiging member dito sa blog! well, maybe it's good that he leave the documentation to us...  so let's talk about the summer slam. as i said ang galing ng venue.  Chris and I met Ayn at UP where she's taking summer classes. I think I almost tripped on my skirt (este, Chris's skirt pala) going up AS steps.  Charms met us near Casaa and we hopped into Ayn's van to go to Amoranto Stadium.  It was heavy traffic along Kamuning and I think we spent around 30 minutes just on that stretch. Feeling tuloy namin na sobrang daming taong pupunta sa Summer Slam at yun yung cause ng traffic hehehe!  Finally, we parked at Entre restaurant in front of the Roces entrance of the Stadium.  We went inside and had a pleasant merienda of vegetarian pizza and smoothies. Ang sarap ng pagkain dun.  The vegetarian pizza didn't taste like one... felt like it had meat-- it was that flavorful.  We had to wait for Roel and Allan because they had our passes.  They arrived (too bad they didn't get to eat) a few minutes before 5pm, which was our call time, so we had to go straight to backstage.  The place was big.  The bouncers were big (but not as big as we expected from the magazine articles).  The backstage area was big and there was enough room to laze around before our set.  I was suddenly so nervous because this was the biggest crowd I've performed for so far, though the stadium was no where near full yet at the time.  Astig yung setup ng stage because there was a hhuge net enclosing it. I felt secure enough that no flying bottle of mineral water can hit me during our set hehehe... it made me feel better, that net. Everything was organized.  Things started almost on time and the changes of bands were speedy.  We did an almost perfect set, too (I think I was so nervous and anxious for the end that something else came out of my mouth other than the supposed beginning of empty you! But I recovered quickly anyway!). It was great. Like the UP Fair, it was over before we knew it, and the pressure was off us.  Parang nung UP Fair, sabi namin ni Ayn, "That was it??" Pero okay rin. We could relax, mingle, eat the free pizza and red horse beer, joke around.  Ayn begged not to tell about the Bamboo incident, so I won't ;}  All I'll say is that I'm glad Ralph caught it on video! What a moment.  Oo nga pala... after our set, we ventured out into the audience to get some refreshments while waiting for the ones PULP provided.  Naka isang baso na si Ayn ng red horse nun eh... we were going back to the backstage area when there came a lull in the middle of The Mongols' set.  Sigaw si Ayn ng malakas: "YOU SUCK!" and everyone around her stared.  We were laughing... tawa rin siya. I don't think the band heard it, though.  Siguro sabi ng audience, "Ano ba yang taga-candyaudioline-- ang sama!" Hehehe... wala, you can never stop Ayn from speaking-- or, in this case, shouting-- her mind... especially if she's imbibed the right amount of alcohol :D  Masaya din... sayang nga kasi I couldn't stay long since I had an early flight to Bukidnon the next day, and we still had to meet some friends, hence the Manifesto entry of Ayn.  We had to leave Allan and Roel there... but I think Ralph went back after Manifesto.  Anyway, I'm here in Malaybalay now. I miss my boyfriend and I miss my bandmates.  Buti na lang nag-text sakin si Ayn kahapon. I love you, Ayn!!! Hehehe... hoy, Allan, Roel, Ralph, text niyo rin ako!

      Heller... It's 7pm and I just woke up.. Sobra yata kalasingan ko last night.. After the Pulp Summer Slam, Selena, Ralph, Chris and I went to Manifesto to get some more drinks.. I was so drunk.. I guess it's worth it. I haven't been drinking for a long time while I was busy having an affair with the likes of Paul Verlaine, Charles Baudelaire and Alan Moore.. It's funny that I haven't been in touch with the real world until yesterday.. I've been busy taking Ayn Tristania to the world of Contemporary Europe down to the world of comics..   At last, after a long time (which seemed ages), nakasama ko ulit kayo.. ang saya saya.  I'll miss Selena. Ang haba naman ng three weeks.. I wonder if I'll like that transvestite.. Maybe I should let him read Carlo Vergara's Zsa Zsa Saturna. I bet he'll enjoy it.  I'll just leave the details about what happened yesterday to Selena. Huwag mo na i-mention yung kay Bamboo. Nakakahiya. I was drunk ok. I thought I was still 13 years old. Hahaha!  Gotta go.. I need to be with the "Dark Knight".  "When will you end keeping your fears, inside your dreams, keeping your tears.. Until you hurt me, the one you love, and hurt yourself 'til your heart's dead?? ..Am I dead?"

      Nothing much happened in Mayric's after Selena left. Moonstar 88 played after Candyaudioline. Ralph and I left in the middle of their set. I also had to be home early to finish some stuff.   Allan told us that night that there were some guys there who watched us and loved our set. He told us that these guys are also into bands like My Bloody Valentine and Sonic Youth. I think he went to Romeo's after the gig and met up with the manyak boys there.  I have been receiving some prank texts from this guy since last week. I call it "prank" kasi hindi ko talaga gustong nakakatanggap ng texts sa mga di ko kilala kahit wala yun intention na mang badtrip. Fan daw sha ng Candyaudioline at napanuod daw niya tayo sa Millenia. Yeah right. Siempre, I was being mean to that person. Kung may fans ang candy na gustong maka text ang isang member,  HUWAG AKO . Maawa kayo sa sarili niyo.   That jerk texted that Roel gave him my number during one of our gigs in Millenia. When I asked Roel after our set sa Mayric's about that, he denied it. But he told me that he did give someone my number, but that was only last Sunday. He said it's some guy from a band called Purplechickens na matagal na DAW niyang kakilala. That's funny. I know the guys from that band, and if they want my number, they could just ask for it from me. Unless maybe, they're up to something. If they are, screw them. But I still need to confirm that. Pero anlabo kasi their vocalist has my number. In fact, he was with me when we played in Laguna for Dott's pa-gig last December.   But of course, we all know Roel's talent in making up stories. Either, nag mention lang sha ng kahit anong band na pinagbigyan niya ng number at ibang banda talaga ang pinagbigyan niya, or hindi talaga banda ang pinagbigyan niya at trip lang niya sabihin yon, or wala talaga shang pinagbigyan ng number ko at nag hahallucinate na naman sha. Nakakainis lang kung talagang may pinagbigyan sha ng number ko. Dapat lang sana, nagtanong muna sha sakin kung puede. Pero MAS nakaka inis kung wala talaga shang pinagbigyan at nag iimbento lang sha ng sasabihin sakin. Ilang beses na niya ginawa sa akin yun. Bastard needs to learn a lesson. Why can't he just shut his mouth up?? If he has nothing good to say, manahimik nalang sha. Tapos feeling pa niya close kami. Dream on. That punk ass. Sana... sana lang talaga... ganun kadali mag palit ng drummer. Sana lang.   Selena, we weren't exactly thinking that things are okay between you and Chris. If you saw us smiling, it was because of something else. I was actually worried because I already felt that something was wrong when I approached you both outside of Mayric's. Anyway, I know that it's none of my business. But if you need to talk to someone, I'm always here to cheer you up. No, that didn't sound right. I know very well that it's impossible to cheer up a person who is going through things that is not easy to brush aside. And I also know that things won't easily be better for anyone so I won't wish that for you either. Pero yun lang, if you need someone to talk to, I'm just here. I may not be able to offer you solutions to your problems, but what the heck.  And as for you Mister Allan Montero, matatapos na naman ang buwan ng Hunyo. Nasaan na ang EP?

      We fronted for Moonstar88 and Parokya ni Edgar last night.  I drove there with Chris instead of going with Ayn because I was still in UP with him when Ayn was on her way to our house.  I still had to talk to Chris about personal stuff so I decided to bring him with me and bring the car, so I could leave with him as soon as candyaudioline was finished.  Ironically, we got there earlier than everyone else.  Chris and I were talking in front of Mayric’s when they arrived.  They were obviously surprised to see us together… Chris said when they went inside, “Well, THAT was awkward.” They might have thought that we made up, because Ralph and Ayn were kind of smiling.  Well, guys, not exactly.  We just have to wait and see.  But cross your fingers for me, please…  Medyo di kami tumugtog kaagad kasi hinintay yata ni Allan na medyo mapuno yung place tsaka para dumating na yung lahat ng Moonstar peeps.  We did an ok set, although I think my voice kind of wobbled at certain parts because of my emotional state.  I had to leave right away because we were both tired and we still had to talk.  I don’t know what happened to the rest of candyaudioline after I left. Ayn can tell you about it.

      We practiced last night with Allan, Allan Montero’s old drummer from Aspirin, in the hopes that he could session for us on the weekends when Roel can’t come to gigs.  He was ok, considering it was the first practice.  Nandun din sina Lara, John Paul at Charles. Roel also made a surprise appearance somewhere in between songs. Nakakatawa kasi nagpapa-impress ang puta pag pinapa-demo namin siya hehehe. Baka natatakot siyang mapalitan.  Hindi naman.  We just need someone who can tide us over on weekend gigs.  As it is, we haven’t been playing at the recent Buzz Nights and Roel usually has work on weekends because he’s being trusted more hehehe.  So this is just for practicality. No line-up changes (At least, for now hwehehe…).  After practice we went to the Kamuning Pares place.  Kumain kami, nagkuwentuhan… Ayn was doing her Spanish homework so everyone was trying to “speak” Spanish, too.  La isla bonita, kaldereta la bamba arroz a la cubana en cuardo de aseo.  Hah!  Medyo inantok ako after a while kasi masakit na talaga yung mga mata ko so natulog muna ako sa van ni Ayn.  Nagkuwentuhan pa sila habang tulog ako.  Then we all went home.  Tonight, we’ll be at Mayric’s. See you there!

      Wala pala si Roel, nasa Iloilo kaya malabo tayo mag Buzznight. Speaking of Iloilo, Si Jay ng Kamikazee nasa Millenia pala nung patapos na yung gig nung Thursday. Sabi nga niya sakin, papunta sha ng Iloilo that night. May hinihintay lang. Balak pa nga daw nila mag Boracay after. Sana naman hindi na sumama si Roel dun para tuloy ang gig natin sa Monday.  Sayang yung Buzznight pero ok lang rin. Wala naman kasi tayong practice so malabo tayo mag acoustic lalo na pag yung mga tahimik tutugtugin natin. Ako mismo feeling ko nakalimutan ko narin mga yun. Kadiri naman kung i acoustic natin yung mga maingay.   Ralph texted me this evening. May picture daw tayo sa bagong PULP pero isa lang. Siguro yung sa Summer Slam.   Napa develop ko na pictures natin sa St. Benilde saka yung pic namin ni Selena sa last gig natin sa Millenia.  See you all on Monday!

      Last night Ayn took me to “Death is the Mother of Beauty”, a goth gathering of sorts.  Actually, she tried to take me, but I chickened out at the last minute.  See, it was held at Millenia. Haha. Here it comes again.  Anyway, I won’t bore you with the gory details of my thoughts on Millenia.  I just thought that I could innocently enjoy an event there with Ayn.  When we arrived, I started thinking about unpleasant people and I realized that I couldn’t reconcile myself into entering the place.  So, ignoring the pleads of Ayn (which made my heart bleed, I assure you), I bid her and Jarek goodbye and hopped into a taxi home. End of story.  Well, Allan texted me while I was in the taxi. He was actually heading to something near Ayn’s place in Fairview, and his taxi passed Millenia just at the exact moment my taxi was leaving it.  He said he saw Ayn’s van in front of the place.  For all we knew, our taxis were right next to each other at a stoplight.  Text ko siya, “Astig hehehe”.  He was telling me to bring Ayn to Fairview instead and that the M4 (Charles, John Paul, etc.) would be there later. Sayang. Nasa bahay na ako eh. Pero astig no?   I’ll make it up to you next time, Ayn.  By the way, we’ll be at Mayric’s on Monday.  Allan said we might front for one of the Backbeat bands. I forget which.  Oo nga pala. The question of the day is:  Why isn’t candyaudioline lined up for Buzz Night?

      Selena i'm so sorry about last night. I just realized that I did something wrong to you. It was really rude of me to invite you to Millenia for the Children of Shadows gig. I wasn't thinking straight. I thought then that it would have been nice to spend the night with you there. I also thought that you might be interested in seeing a different atmosphere (despite the event being held at Millenia). I was being stupid. It didn't occur to me until then that you were that affected with what happened to you there. My bad. I'm really sorry.  I guess "some" people there were surprised that I went back to that place. Well they can't do anything about that. I paid for the entrance and my drinks. Many good things did happen last night though, but they had nothing to do with candyaudioline. So I think it won't be right for me to jot them down here. I was just with my ex most of the time anyway and that wouldn't really interest any of you.  Something about Roel came up though. My friends were all concerned about me having Roel as a bandmate. They were asking me stuff like if we could tolerate him. They also told me some stuff about what Roel did to them. It wasn't a surprise that I'd hear those things about him. I can say that I pretty much know him by now. I also wasn't surprised that they'd ask me about him. Many people from that scene are actually pissed at that person and I can't blame them. I do get pissed at Roel too most of the time, but I could easily brush it aside unless he has done something unforgivable to me like that water dispenser issue (buti naayos ni Mike so I could forget about that for now). I also don't like it whenever he messes up with our rehearsals and gigs. Roel is Roel. I guess we could do nothing about that.  Selena sorry ulit.

      I know I can say anything I want here.  This time, it's not somebody imposing what i can or can't say. I choose to censor my own entries because I feel some parts may not be appropriate.  They tend to get too personal sometimes and I don't want to be too transparent about myself.  If I have personal problems-- of which I have a lot right now... too many!-- I don't want them to end up on the blog kasi makakabring down sa mga taong nagbabasa.  I have my personal blog anyway.  Basta... I'm just editing myself until I become comfortable with my own writing style.  Of course, this doesn't mean that you guys can't post your personal stuff here.  Ako lang yung gumagawa ng choice na 'to. You're still free to do it :)  Thanks for the correction, Ayn :) Akala ko Putong hehehe. I only know him as Bird kasi hehehe.

      Pahabol... you know Selena, I was just reading your last post and I think you should stick to your old ways. You shouldn't really refrain yourself from writing your own observations and opinions. It's not possible to be "objective" all the time most especially if you're writing on a journal. These are not articles that we have here. This is a friggin' blog, meant to be private and personal ( at least for Candyaudioline and that includes you). Yes it's on the net but still, who cares what other people might think?  It's still a blog.  Ito suggestion lang, bahala ka kung ano talaga trip mo, you're the blogmaster here. Basta trip mo, at hindi trip ng iba. Wala namang taga Board of Censors dito eh.  Fuck that.  Tignan mo yung mga sumunod na posts halatang wala na kami ma sabi at ma-react. It doesn't really matter kung may conflict tayo sa mga ideas on a certain subject. That should be expected because we're still individuals on our own even if we all belong to just one band. Parang marriage yan eh, kahit mag-asawa kayo, magkaibang tao parin kayo. It's not possible for both to be just one and the same person after getting married. That deprives you of your own freedom as an individual and that would mean death for you. I say it's always healthy to talk or debate about something. Yung iba kasi na mashadong pine-personal at pinapalaki ang wala naman, mga may sayad yun. Sablay na sayad (since lahat naman talagang may sayad). If you don't agree with something, then just express what you feel about it and that's it. I think it's a stupid idea for someone to try to impose something on you, most especially if that means depriving you from your own freewill to express your mind. That 's highly stupid, lalo na if it's coming from a person who should be knowing better than that by now.

Nami-miss ko na uli yung dati na tayo tayo lang ang andun.. Ngayon mejo hesitant na ako mag post ng mga bagay bagay na hindi maiintindihan ng iba (like "doggie doggie," manyak boys and stuff..). Ganon pala kadami ang fans---ni Ralph. Harharhar. Lagot, magsusumbong ako kay Charmaine. Teehee.  Wala na bang balita sa kendi? Kamusta ang EP? Matatapos na naman ang June.. Ano, record ulit tayo? Yung "My Silverchair" (extended version). Isang track lang. Para siguradong tapos.   Tugtog na tayo ulit bago maging regular ang pagde-date ko ngayon with _____. Alam niyo na, nawawala ako sa circulo tuwing nakakasama ko yun. Sige ingat, may date pa ako.

      Hay naku.  You know what?  I’m too weird.  I’ve resolved to differ my posting style and try as hard as I can to refrain from putting my personal feelings on this blog.  I find that lately I’ve been becoming weirder and weirder with my posts.  I don’t think I’m being the “objective blogmaster”, as I had promised at the beginning of this blog.  I’m scaring myself.  Too much angst and hang-ups.  I have a personal blog, after all.  So, from now on, I’ll stick to the facts.  I’ll allow myself a side comment or two, but only if it is directly related to something that actually occurred in candyaudioline’s experience.  I want to stick to reporting and make everything pure and true and unadulterated by my skewed perceptions.  As I said, I know this may not be possible, but I’ll try to give candyaudioline readers the information they deserved. Heehee.  Ayn, Ralph and I arrived at Mayric’s a little after 10 pm and so they had to prepare for the set right away.  Allan and Roel were already there.  While they were doing the soundcheck, I had time to observe the new Mayric’s.  It’s very red and very well-lit.  It looks considerably cleaner… a bit more…ahem… respectable as entertainment establishments go.  But the improvements they made were not bad at all.  They have new equipment, a bigger stage and bar, and—more lights! Ack. The lights made me feel a little uneasy, though.  I can’t transcend the crowd anymore while we’re performing… I’m forced to see their faces and this makes me even more nervous.  It almost feels like I’m starting over again.  But the lights did take away the grimy feeling Mayric’s had.  Even if Mayric’s seems a lot less “underground” because of them, at least it looks cleaner :) Anyway, the best thing they did while renovating the place was to take the tops of the old tables and hang them up on the walls.  Yep.  Remember how bad we all felt when we discovered they had the tops of the tables replaced with black formica?  Well, there’s nothing to worry about because now the old works of art will be immortalized on the walls of Mayric’s.  This is even better because we can look at them for as long as we want and admire their artistry, as well as their significance in the bar’s history. Naks.  We played around 5 or 6 songs.  Ralph’s amp kept losing volume in the middle of the song, but Allan had taped our set and we didn’t notice anything bad, except for the usual tiny little mishaps.  Weedisneys played after us and Ralph, Allan, Ayn and I rushed to Marikina where Allan had to oversee a Moonstar 88 set.  I think Allan and Ralph we’re talking about possible steps to take for the EP and the band in general on the way.  After Marikina, we went back to Mayric’s and waited for Cheese to finish (around 2 am).  All of us looked tired from lack of sleep, but we decided to go ahead with our movie watching at Ralph’s new place.  Roel had to bring Jenny home, though.  We passed by Allan’s house to get some vcds and we also ate at the famed Marlet’s. Yum.  Ralph’s place is cute. It’s bigger and nicer than where he and Charmaine used to live, and they have the unit to themselves.  We watched Kung Pow: Enter the Fist. It was really funny, except I couldn’t keep my eyes open anymore after 20 minutes from sheer exhaustion.  I just went upstairs and rested.  After the movie, I think the three of them talked for a while, then I went down so Allan could show us something.  It was the design Putong of Kamikazee had made for the Backstab shirt.  He really got them all well… especially Allan and his khaki jacket and wad of money hehe.  Gilbert looked a little weird, but you could tell it was him because of the fried chicken leg he was clutching.  It was really cool. Putong is talented.  Wish we had something like that for candyaudioline.  We left Ralph’s at 6:30 am and went home.  I slept until 12 noon.  A while ago, I was trying to work Soulseek but it wouldn’t connect.  It said that the server may be down.  I hope someone can help me with that.  I think that was around 8:30 pm or 9.

      Heyo! So we practiced last night, except not at Mang Sam’s.  Roel’s landlord, JC, celebrated his birthday last night and he invited us to play there.  We played there last year, too, so we decided to get some free practice out of it.  We had to meet Allan and Roel at Intramuros at around midnight.  Kamikazee and Parokya had something going on there.  So Ayn picked me up at around 11:30, we picked up Ralph, then made our way to Intramuros.  Then, the proverbial Groundhog Day began for us.  The Intramuros gates we knew were closed and we kept calling Allan for directions on how to get in.  To make it short, we went around and around the Liwasang Bonifacio-Taft-Padre Burgos area looking for a way to get to the elusive Lawton-Pier entrance of Intramuros.  If I got the names of my areas wrong, sorry… that’s exactly the reason why we got lost.  No, wait… RALPH is the reason we got lost, hehe. Anyway, the irony of it all was that, just as we finally entered Intramuros, Allan’s van was driving out the gate.  He told Ralph that we were to meet at Mayric’s instead. Auuuugggghhhh.  So we headed on to Roel’s place.  Who could forget the great food and the lamay-next-door from last year’s party?  When we arrived, everybody was drunk and most were half-naked.  They were screaming, “Tugtog!!! Tugtog!!!” and people started frantically setting up the stage on the next-door lot.  But I have to hand it to them-- for drunks, they seemed pretty well-behaved once the nu-metal started.  They were politely sitting down and appreciating the music.  The experience was initially scary, though, but we felt we owed it to Roel to play as we promised.  When it was our turn, most of the people left, but that was fine for us.  They took time with soundcheck and I got to sing without fuss.  The Manyaks said we sounded good, except for the vocals that couldn’t be heard, but that was ok, considering the makeshift set-up.  Sang “My Silverchair”, “Nothing Much to Lose”, “Discarded Toy” (everyone loves that song, next to “Flaming Walls”), and “Empty You”.  Sat around and talked for a while. Allan was being paranoid about our Millenia entries.  He doesn’t want people to be saying his bandmates are a bunch of inconsiderate whiners.  I understand his concern, but I feel that I voiced out my aggravation in a fair manner.  If you all look at my previous entry on that Millenia incident, I did say that not all the people at Millenia are boors to their PAYING customers (Tiffany was very concerned about my distress).  The only thing I said that bad-mouthed all of Millenia was the “overpriced food and mediocre service” bit.  But you know what, I really feel that they have overpriced food and I think I am still entitled to say that, Allan.  The fact that this happened to me just made me want to finally say it out loud.  But, for Allan’s peace of mind, I WILL clarify some things about Millenia.  Before this incident, Allan says that Millenia had treated us nicely, and I agree… they gave us a free beer each when we played there once.  The waitresses there never bothered us before and they did let us play as loud as we wanted, though reluctantly.  The entrance used to be P30 I think, which is a pretty fair price.  All of these were the reasons why, just before our last gig there, I was highly recommending people to go to Millenia. I felt it was a musician-friendly place, not to mention the funky inca-like, cozy-hole-in-the-wall feeling it gave.  However, this opinion changed for me when that lady, whose name is CLAUDINE and is supposedly someone in charge there at Millenia, pissed me off with her stupid policies.  Look—people may think I’m making a big deal out of this, but bad service is really a pet peeve of mine, and you just have to bear with my shit.  SHE IS IN A SERVICE-ORIENTED BUSINESS.  This means she has to be polite to her customers; and I don’t just mean in the way she talks because she said things politely, but INSISTENTLY—I mean that even her actions must put the well-being of her customers first.  Isn’t that fair to ask of someone who you’re paying to be of service to you?  And, yes, a forty-peso iced tea (two, in fact) does include service charge… o kahit simple consideration man lang.  Fuck it.    O eto na ha… I don’t have complaints against Millenia the place (except for the price) and most of the staff.  I just want to say that it’s this Ms. Claudine and that other waitress (who probably was just ordered to bug us) who really tick me off.  If you need one reason not to go there, it’s because of that Claudine lady.  If you need two reasons, well, to be honest, it’s her and the prices there.  If you need three reasons, sorry… I can’t give you another one, and you can go on ahead and patronize Millenia because the rest of them there are ok.  Can we just please forget this already? Sorry, Allan, pero medyo naasar ako na we had to resurrect this again.  Nabuking tuloy ako na it’s such a big deal to me hehe.  But, seriously, I would’ve let it go already if you hadn’t been so worried about what other people think.  Frankly, I don’t think readers are as stupid as to need all this clarification.  And I have the right to express my opinion, even if it’s to the detriment of an establishment.  Don’t you think that I can discern what is appropriate to say and what isn’t?  Maybe through my rantings, they’ll try to do something about that person, if you say that a lot of people have complained about her. You’re the one who made me blogmaster, anyway.  Basta. Bad trip yung babaeng yun. Kasi pati tayo as a band naapekto.

If he only informed us a day before, we could've planned to be on the road an hour earlier. Labo.  Yessss, I am so panicking about my thesis. Kung vampires lang, i'm sure it started in Europe. The very first vampire literary work, which was written in poetry form, was from Germany. "Der Vampir" by some guy named Howard. Pero kung Horror in general, I'm not that sure if it started in Europe. If I remember it right, HP Lovecraft is not European. Ewan. I just hope, I'd be able to organize my thoughts regarding my thesis. Wish me luck.  See you all tonight sa practice. After midnight noh? Siguro naman dadating na si Roel ontime and hindi lasing ngayon. Haay. At sana ok ang set natin tomorrow. I miss Mayric's. I'm sure mang Oscar missed me too. Hahahah. Newly-renovated pala ha.

      Talked to Allan yesterday. We talked about Roel because I hear that he’s still sore about us not bringing him to his house last Friday night. I can understand… we get to pass by everyone’s house when it’s necessary—why not his? Well, that night we were in a hurry and I think it was fair that we didn’t pass by that time. Anyway, he seems to be a bit ornery lately. Hopefully we can smooth things out soon. Allan also gave me advice about Chris. I guess I should be more tolerant. I can’t believe I actually need to tell myself that now.  Ayn and I ym-ed each other a while ago, too. She’s worrying about her thesis a bit.  Well, I’m sure she’ll be able to find more european works of horror.  I think that’s where written horror started anyway.  She said she’s going to the mall this afternoon to buy school supplies.  It’ll be just like grade school--- the smell of fresh notebook paper, the satisfying precision of wrapping your books in plastic, the conquest of labeling your books with your name… ahh, yes.  Today, I took an exam for work. It was just tiring to commute, but I don’t mind. I have to get serious sometime.  Tonight, we might have practice. Tomorrow night we’re playing at Mayric’s, everyone. Attention, Listers! We have a gig. Sigh. Good, old, lovable, just-renovated Mayric’s.

      Beethoven: Music is a dreadful thing. I don't understand it. What does it do?  Schindler: It exalts the soul.  Beethoven: Utter nonsense, if you hear a marching band, is your soul exalted? No, you march. If you hear a waltz, you dance.                   If you hear a mass, you take communion. It is the power of music... to carry one directly into the mental state...                  of the composer. The listener has no choice. It is like hypnotism.  **************  Merong sumasayaw sa goth. Lalo na pag industrial or waltz ang beat (kadalasan sa neo-classicism). But of course, we dance differently. Some even hiss (showing their fangs) after a band plays to show how they appreciate the sound, instead of just clapping their hands.  Sa case ng candyaudioline, bihira sobra ang meron sumayaw (or mag react in any other way), pag pumalakpak pilit pa, mainly because astounded pa ang mga tao at napag-iisip, "chong, may pagka bading ba si Allan? Hindi nga."   Happy "indie" pendence day rin sa lahat.

      physical reaction to music is the same as how a person would to a certain sonic stimulation/situation or aural sensation. people will dance to techno, disco, funk, samba/bossanova/calipso/cha-cha and rock & roll because of the beat... headbanging, moshing at slamdancing naman ang reaction sa metal (mapa-heavy, speed, grind o death pa yan) , hardcore/punk/emo/ska (new & old skool a like) and  grunge because of the energy that comes out of the music... jazz naman mostly taken sitting down therefore illiciting toe or foot taps, finger snaps and a little head bobbing. R&B and hiphop naman ang dahilan kung bakit maraming nabubuntis ng maaga... as for indierock and indiepop is a breeding ground for unconventional body movements and pa-cute dancelike  gestures... sa shoegaze naman (sama na natin ang noisepop/dreampop/goth/ethereal/darkwave/softcore/60's psychedelia/ambient-trance-chill-out) iba... sa loob ang epekto to the point that when you're hit hard, it puts you in a motionless state of being most of the time. the sound that these musical forms create  plays with the mind...   oo nga pala... wala lang!!! happy INDIEpendence day to everyall of you!!!

      I think those guys from Asian Dub Foundation have puny little minds. Their heads couldn't grasp what shoegaze really is. Main reason why they find it boring. It's like me, not liking Mathematics. My mind couldn't grasp it enough, that's why I think it's boring. These people have just proven themselves to be too shallow to know shoegaze. Much as they did themselves a favor by saying that on air, they did us too a favor by implicitly stating that despite their being a good band, they're still not up to the shoegaze standards. I should know because I used to be as stupid as them before.   One thing I can say, you can never be against something you don't understand. By simply saying that something is boring, it just goes to show that you know nothing about it and better shut your mouth up. Unless maybe, you think that it would be oh-so-important to confirm your stupidity in public (or on inter/national TV for that matter).  They think they are "the best UK band". Maybe they really are, but only in certain parts of UK that they recognize. Because frankly, I know very well, that ADF was never the best UK band. They're just trying to pull-off another one of those stints like what The Beatles ("We're more famous than Jesus Christ") and Oasis ("We're more famous than The Beatles") did. Look what happened to them in the end. And they were far better and more famous than ADF.   I admire ADF for their guts no matter how trying hard they are by thinking that they could pull this shit off succesfully. They may be good, but definitely not the best.   Well, who cares if they are a bunch of imbeciles? I still like the band.  As for the Sandwich issue, yes, you do have a point there. I actually did Sandwich a favor. And even if their albums are so disposable, the possibility that you presented could happen. Possible yes, but I'm just not sure if it's likely to happen. Might but still unlikely. For me, they belong to the roster of bands that include After Image and Introvoys. People will be embarassed to admit that they once listened to them as years pass by. Hence my line in the article. It really was an insult to be likened to them. I bet they are aware of that already. (and I could definitely go on and on stating point by point on how they really are rather than just saying that they're plain boring..but why waste time and effort on something that is already common knowledge?)  Anyhow, that's not my problem anymore. But I guess they should thank me for the favor. It's bad manners not to do so. :)

      I just had an epiphany today. You know MTV Alert? Well, they were featuring the Asian Dub Foundation there.  I like Asian Dub Foundation.  They were interviewing Pandit G and he said they were the best live band in the UK.  He said it’s because most UK bands are boring.  So boring, he said. “We call them ‘shoegazers’ because they just play and look at their shoes.”  I was laughing so hard.  Even if he was dissing shoegaze, I was screaming to my sister, “That’s US! He’s talking about US! Hahahaha!”  You know what?  I don’t really mind him saying that.  So shoegaze doesn’t float his boat.  That’s understandable. I still like ADF and I respect their opinions because they’re fantastic musicians.  In fact, by saying that, he unwittingly did a service to us by educating kids overdosing on MTV about shoegaze.  Sure… their first impressions on shoegaze will be “boring” because Pandit G says so, but at least now, they have a name for it.  Most people who watch candyaudioline and don’t like us because we’re so blah on stage only think, “I don’t like them because they’re so boring.”  But now, since they have a term for it, they’ll know we’re boring because we’re adhering to a certain type of music—i.e., shoegaze!  And maybe some of the kids who like ADF and watched that MTV Alert thing will be curious about shoegaze, start listening to samples of it, and will maybe even start to like us! Galing.  Isn’t it great how everything in the music scene is actually interconnected?  You can’t diss someone without calling attention to them. I remember indie AJ was laughing at some ska that was playing on the Freedom Bar speakers… I listened and thought some of it actually sounded fun.  I’m sure some people who’ve read the article on us have brought out their old Sandwich albums to see if we really sounded like them, then rediscovered their like for them.  Ganun lang naman yun di ba? One man’s meat is another man’s poison.

      Haha… I think I feel the same way about that, Ayn.  Sayang pala na hindi ako nakasama sa sa inyo last time. Bad trip. Pero kailangan ko talagang kausapin si Chris nun kaya ok lang din. Basta next time sama niyo na ko ha!  Pero… when are we going to have enough money to release our EP with all this libido spewing out of our ears??  Hehe… kidding. I know that we’re really just trying to look for a less expensive but quality means of production. Sigh. Or maybe that’s just an excuse to refrain from sending out a “crummy-sounding” EP— DI BA, ALLAN?  Maganda naman EP natin eh, huhuhu…  Anyway, I have nothing to say right now. Just whiling away the time before I watch a movie with my sister on the PC.  Wala naman kasi akong ginagawa ngayon dahil wala pa akong trabaho and everyone else has something to do: Allan and Roel have work, Ayn has school, and Ralph has his toys at home hehe. Me? I’m just postponing jobhunting because I’m still a bit scared to death. I just have to calm down. I’ll get up off my ass later ;)  Last night, Erick, one of the listers, messaged me while I was sending Ayn her scanned pics of Tristania.  He was asking if there were any gigs up. Told him how short notice we always were and that we’ll always post them on the blog if we’re notified early enough. Haha! Well, ganyan talaga kami sa candy…  Wow, dumadami na rin ang listers! Yehey!

      To hell with Millenia, man.. As I already informed you online and through text, I posted a message sa Buzznite mailing list and told them how Millenia is and took some excerpts from your post here. Screw Millenia.  Anyway, yesterday's gig at Benilde was okay. Ralph, Sir Charles, Selena and I were on the road to Benilde by 4:30 pm. Ah oo nga pala, sumama rin si Roel sa atin from Universal Records pero shempre sumablay nanaman sha. And this time pati si Ralph nainis narin. Si Roel kasi mukhang ewan. Basta nagpababa sha somewhere in Morayta to get his tool box and sticks. Hindi pa kasi dinala. Tapos kami pa talaga ang mali.   Sobrang traffic along Kamuning and in Manila area. We arrived at the venue around 7 pm i think. Hassle pa sa location ng parking. Paikot ikot kami sa Taft. Buti nalang naka kain na kami sa Mc Do (beside La Salle). Siempre while we were at the area, reminiscing ako ng past moments ko sa lugar na yon. Yihee to me.  Nakakainis lang kasi busog na ako eh may libreng food pala sa..what was it called?--function room? Basta, that "band room." We did a great set. Or should I say, Candle Audio Line did a great set. Hehehe. Also Soft Pillow Cases. Eric (of Tracks) was there too but he wasn't able to watch us because his band had a gig at Kafe. Shit naalala ko na naman si Roel nung inaasar niya ako dun while we were recording at Tracks. Baka isipin ni Eric I have the hots for him or something. And Eric must have found that kind of freaky because during that time I obviously looked 8 months pregnant. Kaya for the rest of you who must have thought that I was demure and all during the whole time that we were recording at Tracks, sa totoo lang nagpipigil lang ako nun. Si Roel kasi ay isang mangmang.  Going back to the Benilde gig... we only got to play four songs (or was it five?). Basta bitin.. We left the venue then went straight to Paranaque. Allan had to meet up with Dott and Arnel of Skies of Ember to get something. Lara and I wanted to drink, so we bought Mompo (that spanish sacramental wine) at that convenience store where we met up with the two guys. We hung out for a while then we left for Marikina where Allan had to attend to his Backbeat obligations. Before going to Marikina, we had to drop Selena off to her place first because she had to be home early. Then we went straight to Riverbanks. There was an NU summer-ender gig there.   When we left, Roel and Emerson took the ride with us. Also, my very good friend Richard Tan. Heheh. We missed each other a lot. We talked about stuff that we liked while we were on the road. Hehehe. We dropped the three someplace I forgot.   So the rest of us, went off  to that infamous whorehouse where the Sirs go to regularly. But before that, Charles had an emergency and was desperate to go to the john. Pinagbigyan namin.   When we arrived at "the" whorehouse, ayun, we were greeted by these 15-16 year old looking nymphets (kaya pala nymphets at hindi nymphs), clad in short short skirts. Once they move an inch, you could see their buttcracks. Of course they couldn't care less about that because they all had to dance at the center of the videoke space, wearing only their undies. Much to the surprise of the Sirs, the last one who danced, literally stripped herself naked at the center while doing her thing. Charles told me that he had never seen anyone do that before. (I was thinking then, "kasi andito ako." Heheh) Usually they were just in their undies but they never went topless and all. Obviously, our eyes were all glued at her.   The place was okay. Good service (way better than Millenia of course). I'd rather pick that place anytime than go to Millenia. We had brandy, sisig and crispy pata (yung pagkain talaga ha). Sulit yung food. Pero siempre, we couldn't really concentrate on eating while those "girls" were dancing seductively to the tune of "Dying Inside" or some other mainstream disco/rn'b/love song (na hindi ko na kayang marinig ngayon without remembering those chicks).   I know the rest of my companions were kinda pissed at me, because I wouldn't sing. Dude, ayoko talaga. I hope you understand. I wasn't that drunk enough. Maybe if I get more drunk, I might sing. Might. I'm really sorry if I was that killjoy. But if you'd ask me if I had fun, I really did and to tell you the truth, I'm looking forward to seeing those girls again. Really.   Don't get me wrong. They're not exactly my type. If I had to go to bed with another woman, I don't want that woman to look like any of those girls. If I were to get laid with a chick, I would want her to be more whore-ish but not innocent looking like those women from that place. I want someone who has more spunk, if you know what I mean. Though if I get drunk enough, I might consider taking that chick who danced last, to bed. Only if she wraps her face with plaster. But then again, since i'm drunk, I might not care after all. I don't know.  That night, I was actually thinking that if I had a man lover who frequents those type of places, and he has the guts to bring me there, I might consider having a threesome with him and whoever he likes from that whorehouse where he goes to. Provided that I am also attracted to that chick. To their misfortune, none of my ex's ever confessed to me that they visit that type of place--or maybe, none of them really had the guts to admit to me that they really do frequent whorehouses. Oh well, that was their loss.   As for the sirs, since I'm not really attracted to any of them and only see them as friends, I still couldn't imagine what they do there whenever they're alone at that place. I bet you guys were so bad trip that Lara and I had to tag along. You didn't get to do what you usually do there. Whenever I consider the idea of trying to imagine what they actually do there, I feel like I have to vomit. So i'd rather not think about that. As in-- yuck pare. Ewan bahala kayo.  I got home around 4 am. I wasn' t that drunk that night unlike last Thursday at Millenia. Last Thursday, I had three margaritas and four beers. Pasalamat kayo Millenia at pinapatulan ko ang inumin niyo tapos ganun lang pagtrato niyo sa kabanda ko. Pakyu all.

      Last night was our first gig in a little over a month and it was good.  We were so excited to play together again, and also a bit nervous because our last practice was a disaster. Thankfully, Roel was ok. Thankfully, my voice was ok. Everything was ok during our set.  Some people even clapped, though that was just probably the manyaks plus eloha and popoy. Still, I think people enjoyed the set. I did… but I was really nervous all throughout. I think my stage fright came back a little. Well, I got the feel of it after a few songs. I was especially proud of “Nothing Much to Lose”. I think I’ve finally mastered the proper way to sing it without putting too much strain on my throat.  Ralph and Allan seemed pleased about the set, too.  I showed everyone the member profiles I did and they liked it :)  Except that Allan insisted that he didn’t know how to breakdance. Hoo. Asked him to show my sisters the Strut after our set. Reluctant pa siya, but he had to give in. It was delightful.  Anyway, I just had to change one sentence for clarity and add another band to Roel’s list.  In a few days, Ralph will probably be able to post the profiles on the site and you’ll see how accurate my descriptions are, especially Roel’s hehe.  It was nice last night… except that the management of Millenia really sucks. I’m sorry, Millenia, but you really have to work on your customer relations and not put profit first before service. It’s highly unethical.  Anyway, my sisters and I ordered a few iced teas as courtesy to the fact that Millenia doesn’t have a cover charge anymore.  So we had a table to ourselves near the cashier… I guess we were thirsty because we finished our iced teas before the candy set started (we were 2nd). The waitress took our glasses and wiped our table right away. A few minutes later, one of the other waitresses comes to our table and shows us the menu. We shake our heads, indicating we weren’t ordering… but she insists by taking a flashlight and shaking a light over the damn piece of cardboard.  We shake our heads again, then she asks if we’re from the band.  I say that I am and that we had ordered already. She goes away.  After our set, I sit down with my sisters and we’re talking happily about the performance when this lady comes and asks us if we’re ordering. I tell her we’ve already ordered. She asks if we’re still going to order. We’re not. She says, “why don’t you move to where your bandmates are sitting? Customers might come in and we’d like to let them sit down at a table and give them a chance to order… if you’re not ordering anymore, that is.”  Allan senses something so he asks what’s up.  She tells him. He says I’m from the band. She repeats her request to him.  He looks around and says, why not make them move when there are customers already?  She starts to protest, but I, thinking that customers were already waiting, offer to move anyway.  So my sisters and I just take three chairs and stick to the wall.  By this time, I’m already starting to mull over the injustice of making us move—we were paying customers, too!  Then I noticed that it had already been five minutes and no one was sitting at the table we had vacated!!! Fuck that freaking shit.  I was so angry… just because we didn’t look like we were ordering anymore, why did she have to treat us like second-class citizens?!  I only agreed to move because I thought that there were customers who needed a table badly.  What if I weren’t part of the band—what if my sisters were customers there on their own? She wouldn’t have asked them to move… or maybe she would have because they weren’t going to order anymore! I wanted to walk out right then and there.  I went outside to tell Allan and Ralph that I wanted to leave because of the insulting treatment that lady was giving us. And to think we actually ordered just to be courteous! Never mind that we only ordered iced tea… by doing so, we were still patrons of the establishment and were therefore entitled to our own table! So I was telling Allan all this and Tiffany, who is part of Millenia, noticed I was fuming. She asked us if there was anything wrong and Allan explained.  She gave profuse apologies, which gave me the impression that she wasn’t aware that customers were being treated this way.  Her companion commented, “Oo nga, bad trip yung ganyan, pare. Nakakawalan ng gana. Pagsabihan mo yun.”  I calmed down after seeing that not everyone at Millenia is totally devoid of good manners… her sympathy was almost enough to soothe me. Almost.  She explained that Millenia had hired new management or something like that and that there have been complaints from other people. Anyway, I decided not to leave after all. I did decide to go and eat at the Pares place across with sina Allan. That’s the last time I patronize that resto bar. Overpriced food and mediocre service. Bah.  Thank God. Allan said that Millenia is planning to have just showbands there by July 2003.  Good riddance.  We weren’t able to go out after that because nobody had much money left. Indie Jeff was pleading with us to come eat, but we had to go home. Tonight na lang. We have a gig at Benilde. See you Benilde people there.

      Allan called me up kanina and asked me whatwas up with all my depression. I told him. It’s deeper than you guys think, though. I don’t think I can bring myself to talk about it. It’s on my personal blog though, the closes thing to talking about it, that is. Don’t worry. I’m not going to do anything stupid. I may snap out of it in a while. Maybe. Thanks for the pep talk and insights, ayn and allan.  Right now, I’m doing the member profile. Yahoo. Ralph’s and mine na lang. Si Ralph naman kasi napaka deep hehehe. Ang hirap.  Mamaya sa Millenia.

      I think what you're going through now Selena, is normal. Everybody goes through that stage one way or another. Writer or not. With me, i'm more of going through existentialism angst for the past 4 years. But i'd rather keep that bottled inside myself than flaunt it around. Unless somebody starts a conversation with me about it. As for the "writer" thing, I couldn't really comment on it because many writers could write about being neurotic and such without experiencing it at the same time. They just narrate their past experiences (take note on "past")--that's why it's in narrative form.   I say, it's better to be depressed than repressed.  Lighten up dude.

      Hey, thanks, guys :) That thing about dadaism really helped me, ayn. Also the "get the message across" thing, allan. gosh. I feel better now.  I still haven't finished the member profile. sorry. writer's block. i'll try to have it ready by tomorrow's gig, though. don't worry.  you know what, maybe i AM meant to be a writer. i'm certainly neurotic, depressed and suicidal enough. not that writers need to be like that, but it's enough fuel to be one. you need to be slightly crazy to try to fuck with other people's minds. never mind. forget about being a writer-- it's a struggle enough to be a decent person. i just read over some of my old journals tonight and realized that i've always had this very dark side of myself hidden under my smiles and cheery optimism. it's sad to find your true self out like this. "This has been kept a secret from me by my own self???? Shitty bitty fuckeroo." (insert despaired slump into deep,plush, blood red armchair)  Tangina. I don't know what's happening to me. What a delayed crock of teenage-angst bullshit. hello? i should really get real. society requires it of me.

      No need to be paranoid about your minor grammatical error, Selena. I think people wouldn't really notice it. Unless, they would take time to do workshop on the article, which is unlikely. I think Joey made more obvious grammatical errors on it. And nobody really cares. As Allan said, as long as one could understand what is being said, the grammar wouldn't really matter that much. I'd rather prefer that anytime than going by the book and in the end, nobody would really get what i'm saying. The article does not require an academic approach anyway. It was an informal interview.  In addition to that, if you're conscious about your being a CW graduate, the Dadaists,  the post realist and meta theater writers already gave our generation an excuse to have grammatical errors. It was part of the Dadaist principles which were stated in Tristan Tzara's and Andre Breton's manifestos. ("dada tries to find out what words mean before using them, from the point of view not of grammar but of representation...") I hope that would make you feel better.  Yeah, i guess you're kinda messed up. I don't mean it as an insult. Did the Taka drinks do anything to you? Or should we blame HP Lovecraft? Hmmm...   On a lighter note, I had so much fun last Tuesday. Now I understand why Frida caught Marra Lanot's attention years ago when she went on vacation to visit some Latin American countries. Hmmm...   I loved the Taka Honey Green Tea. I would surely get some drinks there again when I go back to Galleria. Let's watch another movie soon. Hopefully kasama narin natin sila Allan.  See you all tomorrow night!   "I destroy the drawers of the brain and of social organization..." -Tristan Tzara, from "Dada Manifesto"

      HAHAHAHAHA, Ayn! Roel talaga… nasabihan ka na nga na may practice that night. But what am I writing this for?-- you don’t even look at the blog. And it’s no use addressing you through the mailing list either because you’re not even a member! Sigh. I guess he’s just not the type to “surf the IT wave”, hehehe. Just talk to him in person, everyone.  I was supposed to repent and finally write about Sunday night’s practice, but Ayn beat me to it. Damn. That must mean I really am an ass about my posting duties. Sorry. I’m undergoing a pre-life crisis at the moment. Post-graduation anxieties. Buti sana kung mabubuhay ka sa pagbobokalista lang. So yun. Ngayon lang ako na-motivate to do something remotely productive (even if, in the grander scheme of the universe, this is worth diddly-squat). Okay, I’ll cut my angsty crap now. :/  I’ll just talk about today. Ayn picked me up this morning so I could help her register at UP. I can’t believe I don’t have to do the same thing anymore. It’s both liberating and sad… oh, and scary. Ayn had a slight problem with her reg material. As usual, Filipino efficiency at its finest. But hey… the university never has enough funds to pay people to do things right, so it’s not entirely their fault. Anyway, Ayn had it fixed. I had originally planned to take care of my own university issues, too, but lunch break was coming, and we were both hungry and raring to go to the mall. Traffic was unbelievable (Is this how it’s going to be once school starts? God help us).  We had overpriced, under-flavored food (but yummy drinks), then shopped for Tristania’s assorted needs. We had missed the first showing of “Frida” and had to while away two and a half hours.  We then had more yummy drinks, mostly because Ayn had to smoke somewhere, peed, and watched the movie. It was good. I like Frida’s paintings. I also went on a horrible rollercoaster ride on my views on marriage. Never mind. I’m at it again.  To cut it short, Ayn and I had a nice girl’s day out. Bonding kami. Saya. Siguro sasabihin na naman ni Allan, “Hindi na naman kayo nagyaya!” Well, that man’s time isn’t his own. Poor guy. Allan, kuwento mo naman yung Pong Pagong thingie.  Kita-kits sa Thursday! Masaya yun.  Oh yeah. I just want to clarify the “glorifying” issue. In the article kasi, I was quoted as saying, “…scoffing at the term is just bad as glorifying in it,” and not mistakenly so. I think I really did say that. Anyway, that’s wrong grammar because “glorifying” is a verb that needs an object, which I didn’t have in that sentence, since “in it” is just a prepositonal phrase. What I meant to say was “glorying in it” or “glorify ourselves with it”. I could also have said “glorifying it”, which wasn’t exactly what I intended to say but is close enough (although, from a compositional viewpoint, this is actually a better alternative to what I originally meant).  Did that confuse anyone? I think it did me, even a little. Sorry, I didn’t intend to sound like a prissy intellectual. I’m just being anal because I was quoted in a magazine practicing bad grammar, and I can’t forgive myself—especially since I used to be an English Major. I know it doesn’t really matter since I don’t have perfect grammar all the time. But to say something like that in print (and I don’t mean electronic print like in websites) is plain humiliating yourself. People read about crap everyday, and you don’t need to add your bullshit for their perusal. Thousands of people have read and are going to read that article. Out of each thousand, at least a hundred will read it, laugh disdainfully and forever think I am a total ditz for my tiny grammatical error. I know, because I am like that. Anyway, a couple of hundred people thinking me stupid is a little too much for me to bear.  God, am I messed up, or what?  Um, does anyone recall how I described myself in the first entries of this blog? Hehehe. Shit, man. Hell… does anyone recall what I said I am currently going through in the first paragraphs of THIS entry?  Towljah…  Ayn, you must think I’m on some pretty powerful shit, right now… This is worse. It’s neither synthetic nor organic. It’s imaginary. It’s horrible. Something out of Lovecraft.  Allan, pwede na bang pang-album inlay? A la Belle and Sebastian. Haha. Asa.  I’d apologize, but that would be more of my worthless drivel.  I’ll just do everyone a favor and stop.

      Yes, nabuhay si Selena..   Last night's practice was weird. It turned out that we were still able to trash mang Sam's studio.. We only practiced for an hour though.. I bet mang Sam couldn't wait to get rid of us. Nagsama pa ang SPK at kendi. I heard naglasing sila Allan the last time they practiced there. Ako, i had two beers already before we practiced. After that, may brandy pa sila Sir manyak. Kami ni Lara, umiinom na from the bottle on our way to my place. Si Lara lang ang nakapag pa inom sa akin ng ganun ulit after how many years. We dropped by Lara's place for a while to get some food. We also passed by the Total convenience store near my place to buy some more booze and cigs. I drank a bit of vodka courtesy of Eloha. Same vodka mix I had after I gave birth.   Sino sino ba kami? Sir Charles, Sir John Paul, Sir Allan, Roel, Jen, Eloha, Popoy, Lara, Selena and Ralph. Nagluto muna ng food sila Lara then kumain kami. Since si Roel present, ang pagkain na baboy. Sinira pa ang water dispenser namin. Ang kamalasan nga naman. Dumating pa sha sa studio na lasing. Nasira pa yung kick sa drums. Roel isa nalang talaga, gugupitin ko na buhok mo.  The inuman ended around 5am, I think. They took a picture with Trista. Sumama rin si Trista sa paghatid sa lahat. I'm so surprised na nagustuhan niya company ng lahat. May mga tao na mas madalas pa makita ni Trista pero ayaw niya sa kanila. Harharhar.   Selena ikaw nalang mag post ng ibang details about last night. Sakit pa katawan ko... I hope matapos mo na yung member profile natin for the site.   Oo nga pala, candyaudioline has a gig on June 5 (Thursday), Millenia. "In Between Days" with bands like Weedisneys, Soft Pillow Kisses, Archaster, Downboydown, Popular Days, etc. Sa Sunday Grabe Sunday, Soft Pillow Kisses ang tutugtog. Siempre hindi ang kendi. Dahil sa akin. Bwahahahaha.  Screw the mainstream.  Ayn Ruth Baudelaire    "Weee!" -Allan (the artist formerly known as Pong Pagong)

      I am back, of course.  Tonight, we have practice. Allan called a while ago, but I couldn't answer because I was driving. Chris talked to him. I don't know for sure but they mentioned something about us being banned from a studio and looking for another one. Hahaa! Us? Banned from Mang Sam's?? Weird. Anyway, I'm not sure if it's true.  I have to get to work on the member profile for the site. As usual, I have waited until the last moment. Sigh. Sige na nga.

      Hi. Sigh. My whole hard drive was erased by this stupid virus.  Years worth of college work have been wiped out. I know most of it was crap, but I would’ve liked to keep my fiction and my NFNs if I could. Damn.  Well, new life. Chris hasn’t fixed my computer yet but he did make his hard drive functional so we could type and surf the net for really important stuff like checking mail and writing in my blogs. Don’t count on lengthy entries until he gets everything shipshape though.  It was fun last Monday.  I actually didn’t know we had a gig… thought that we were going to go to practice so I just wore my pambahay shirt.  I was even thinking of not wearing a bra (since I was gonna wear a jacket anyway) and just using slippers.  Hey, I didn’t think anyone would care at Alberto’s if I dressed up or not.  It’s a good thing it was raining that night because I wore a bra after all and I also decided to wear sneakers so my feet wouldn’t get wet.  Imagine my surprise when Ayn directed her driver to bring us to Mayric’s. Whew.  It was traffic along the way because a blackout hit a section of España and caused vehicles to knot up at one intersection.  We spent around half an hour there, but even so we got to Mayric’s before Allan and Ralph did.  Roel was there already, chatting with the Cheese drummer.  He let me text on his phone.  We did a surprisingly good set that night.  Ayn actually consented to do an old song. In fact, it was Ralph who confessed afterwards that he had forgotten how to play that particular song.  But nobody noticed anyway.  It was fun because you could tell that some of the people with whom we always play noticed the difference and it looked like they liked it.  Ralph’s gadget was shot for the middle of the set, but we still pulled it off.  Allan liked the combo of soft songs and heavy songs so much that he wants to do that for subsequent gigs.  Ayn and I had to go early because she still had class the next day.  Her mom also arrived that night from Hong Kong.  Anyway, all of us at Candy were satisfied with how the night turned out.  Yesterday, Allan and Charles called me up three-way to chat.  Allan was teasing Charles about the Streetlife night.  Seems he WAS entranced by Ayn and I showing some skin.  Hindi namin sinadya yun.  Manyaks will be manyaks.  Allan had to cut our conversation short because his mom needed to use the phone.  Tonight, we’ll be fronting for Parokya at Freedom Bar. I’m not sure yet, though.  Ayn hasn’t texted Allan back. But be there anyway.

      Heller. I know I haven't been posting here for the longest time. Wala lang. I was too preoccupied with personal stuff. That happens once you start your own personal blog. Anyway, Selena told me last night that her computer crashed. I hope it gets fixed right away. Since Selena can't be online as of the moment and Ralph and Allan are both busy with work I'll try to sub for her posting duties.  I was supposed to be with Jefkid but he suddenly changed plans. Sayang. Kismet and Karen (did I get their names right?) were expecting to see him.   Last night, we ended up playing third to the last. (Third to the last o third from the last? Toink!) We played after Maple Syrup. Moonstar 88 played after our set then Kamikazee. Shet, tamad talaga ako. Ganito nalang, I'll just cut-paste some excerpt from my own blog about last night's happening.    Last night, we played at Streetlife in Glorietta for the Kamikazee Bar Tour. They say we did a great set. I’m not sure if we really did. Allan’s guitar kept on having glitches. I just found it funny because Joey Dizon of PULP was there to cover the event and he was sitting in front. He seemed like he was enjoying our set. Maybe he really was enjoying it.     Anyway, going back to the gig, Kamikazee played last of course. Jay must have been really drunk by then. He totally trashed Streetlife. Earlier that night, he still seemed quite normal. We were talking about how the place doesn’t allow smoking anymore (because of some stupid ordinance) and he even offered me a cig. I don’t think anybody from our crowd really followed that new rule. We all still managed to smoke there and the floor under our tables was littered with cigarette butts. When the night ended, after what Jay did to the place, the waiters were already too scared to reprimand us and we managed to smoke all over the place.     Jay was so drunk that night, I doubt it if he’d remember now most of the stuff that he did that night. If someone would narrate to him the happenings last night, he would probably just go, “O pare, nagawa ko yun?"    Sometime in the middle of their set, he even threw up near the drums area. He was spitting out cuss words that night and towards the end, he stripped himself down to his undies. He was dancing near our table one time and we could see the outline of his thingies. He he he. But that wasn’t his first time to do that so we’re actually quite used to it. Since it was only their second time to play there (we were also with them when they played there first time and our drummer and their drummer ruined the snare of the show band), the Streetlife management and crew were shocked at him. That was fun.     Maybe next time, they would allow us to smoke there as exemption. That is, if there would still be a next time.   Ayan.  Mamaya ba may practice? Text-an nalang.

      Ooooh, so we’re playing right after Monsterbot, eh? ;) Just kidding. Makes no difference to me.  Actually it does because I was supposed to be going to this birthday party with Chris on Saturday night… but I guess we’ll have to cut our visit short.  Pero paano yan kung wala si Ralph?  Maybe we should go back to being last.  We all know how the crowd at Streetlife hates us.  Then again, that just may be because we were lined up before a showband and that people there “wanted to dance already”. Sheesh.  Anyway, anything is fine. Just let us know what the final say is. Thanks, Allan.  I just remembered.  When Allan and Ayn were fighting the other night, I felt like a kid watching her parents argue.  Why is that? Not that there’s something going on between them, but it felt like family problems, you know.  Yesterday, I watched “The Hours” with Chris.  I saw the Fatal Posporos vocalist alone, watching.  Oh nothing. I just like putting any stuff vaguely related to the music scene here.  And while I’m at it, let me just say that I think one of the Boldstar guitarists lives near my house because I’ve seen him twice in pambahay and with bed hair.  It’s weird. They’re real people, too, bed hair and all.  I wonder if anyone wonders if we at candyaudioline are real people. I doubt it.  Well, let’s just see each other at Glorietta, then.

      YEHEY! I get to post a real entry for the first time in weeks! Sorry… as you all know (though you didn’t really need to), I have been in crises for the past weeks.  Emotional and then financial. But now, I have my life in some semblance of control and I can afford internet service. Haha.  I am cheery today despite my aching, fatigued body because we had a really good acoustic set last night at Altered Native in Fairview.  Allan was only able to notify us on the day itself so we were all caught off-guard.  Ayn was particularly miffed because she had a report to do for school the next day.  We had a bit of a tense moment (to put it VERY lightly) there before our gig, but Allan and Ayn were able to make up by the end of the night.  And of course, that never stopped them from giving a great performance :D  We were all great! Ralph was nervous about his acoustic leads but he pulled them off well… and I didn’t even notice anything weird from Roel, either.  He made it just the right volume for the “acousticity” of it all. Hehe.  This is the first time since I came back from Bukidnon that I felt good after a gig.  I think I saw some people actually tapping their feet.  They responded pretty well and we had some applause.  Popular Days had also performed before our set.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear their cover of “Ahpraham” by the Sugar Gliders (I hope I spelled that right) because I had just been listening to that song that very morning.  John Paul said that Allan wasn’t satisfied by their rendition yet, but they haven’t fixed it up yet anyway.  As usual, for their originals, they gave a tight performance. And, as usual, the crowd didn’t really react to them much.  Eric was moaning something about “shallowness”… I told him it was good that they were exposing these people to that kind of music.  I’m sure that out of the hundred or so who were present, the Manyaks were able to touch at least ten. Baby steps. Everything counts.  After our set, Ayn and I sat with our friends Mia and Joey. They kindly bought some rounds for us.  I was feeling brave… it felt really good to get that buzzed feeling again.  I was giggling at the Parokya set and I think Gab even noticed from the stage how weird my perma-smile looked (or am I having illusions of grandeur? ;).  I was so happy with the performance and being with my friends and feeling so carefree, even for just a few moments.  Last night, Life was gooooooood.  I even enjoyed it when Ayn’s former music teacher and another nameless customer went up on stage to play a few cheesy songs.  We moved to Allan’s table where the restaurant had some food for us.  We talked and laughed awhile. I think we picked on John Paul a bit too much, especially me hehehe.  I was revealing some things about him to Mia in Spanish. Haha. At least I can still speak it.  “Ello es en amor con la bajista de…” Shit. I think I said too much back there. Oh well. Nobody ever reads this anyway.  So we all went home after that. Ayn had to work on her report.  She was saying that she wouldn’t be sleeping for it.  Poor Ayn. Mia and Joey took me home. Thanks so much, guys! Thanks for bringing Ralph and I to the gig, Allan. Thanks, Roel, for… um… thanks, Roel. Heehee.  Oh isn’t this a happy-joy-joy entry…?  Just a last note.  I think that, although there were some who enjoyed our set because we performed well, a lot of indie peeps frowned on our Millenia gig last Sunday specifically because we played our version of “Today”. Haha. Di nila nagets.  Hay naku. They’ll never learn.  When have we at candyaudioline ever taken ourselves seriously? I mean… we DO take ourselves seriously with our music, but some of it is also fun and games.  The reason we play is because we have fun doing it.  If we were that serious, we’d have kicked everyone out of the band already for one sablay or another. I guess it all goes back to that icky line: We can’t please everyone.  So we make do with the comments. It’s ok. We’re still alive. We love what we do. I think we should play “Today” at Buzz Night just to start a riot hehehe. ;P  We’ll be the last performers for the night at Streetlife, Glorietta on the 19th! Be there.  Popular Days and Moonstar 88 will be there, too.  I am back.

      I think this template is way better than the old one.   Nothing new really happened during our practice last night. Except maybe for the fact that we practiced without using gadgets for the guitar parts. Ralph lost battery and Allan wasn't able to bring his guitar (or my guitar that he's borrowing) and effects.   We only practiced "Today" and some of our other "safe" songs.   Ralph, Selena and I left right away after practice. I can't stay up late because I just attended an inuman before the practice and was kinda drunk.   ***I can't believe how some people go gaga just because they saw Dong Abay pass by. Try drinking with him, and you surely will find your self disillusioned. Unless maybe you're that starstruck and really won't be able to see through people like him. I guess those are the same people who get so excited just because their band got a slot for Mondo pick up gurls' Sunday Grabe shindig at Mayric's. DUH?!

      hey i just came from tonight's practice. i finally know what that new song sounds like hehehe. it's funny. you can watch out for it... or not.  i've changed the blog template because the last one looks boring already. sorry if i chose this one... for me it hurts the eyes a little, but i think this one's the best of everything else that was there. besides, this has links to other websites so it's a great opportunity to link readers to the candyaudioline site itself (which, by the way, is really cool, even if unfinished).  i'll just post the upcoming gigs:  July 9 - Mayric's (with Cheese and Kamikazee, i think) July 11- UP Bahay ng Alumni (with most of the Backbeat Bands) July 13 - Millenia, In BeTWEEn Days (Don't forget to bring your moolah, if you don't want to get thrown out ;) July 19 - Streetlife (though we'll be last, so come very late, if at all) July 26- though i think this is tentative... don't even know where  okay. i'll post again later at 6 am if I can. If not, Ayn will tell you about last night. I've run out of internet so I can only use off-peak hours. haha.  see you at Mayric's!

      Damn, I was sorry I wasn’t able to attend last practice either.  Don’t worry, I’m pretty much free for the rest of my days…   I hope we’re not banned from Mang Sam’s for good. But I noticed that he has become a little more ornery these days.  Maybe it’s all the late nights. Anyway, I was able to follow your little reasoning in the last entry, Ayn.  It’s a real dilemma—should amps be louder or should we tame ourselves down?  I think amps were made to be that loud because that’s the limit of the human ear… on the other hand, our music just isn’t the same if it isn’t ear-splitting.  Hey. Maybe we just need to go to another studio :)

      Kailan kaya tayo hindi makakasira ng gamit? Ayoko naman i-condemn si Roel sa ginawa niya last practice kasi guilty rin ako sa ganung gawain. Sabi ni Allan ako daw nagsira ng bass amp kina Mang Sam. Tapos kay Mang Jun, muntik ko na masira yung ilaw. At hindi ko na mabilang ang mga nasira kong amp sa tugtugan.   Dapat siguro may makagawa ng amp na para satin. Pero tama ba yun? Yung amp ang makikibagay satin? Pero tama rin ba na makibagay tayo sa amp? Naiintindahan niyo ako? Ako hindi ko kasi naiintindihan mga pinagsasabi ko.  Sige, kawawa naman ako. Kausap ko nanaman ang sarili ko. Itutulog ko nalang to.

      We had practice the other night. Hulaan niyo kung sino nanaman ang pumalpak. Sino pa ba.  The practice was cut short by Mang Sam.  This time, we really are banned for life sa studio.   Pero pansin ko din medyo nagiging a-hole si mang Sam lately. Nung pumunta yung kabanda ko (sa isa pang banda) dun, humirit ba naman si Mang Sam ng, "bawal ang rak dito. bawal."   Bwahahahahaha.  Hindi ko alam kung sino ang sasabihan ko ng "good luck". Tayo ba o si Mang Sam?

      Hey bandmates!  Miss ko na kayo :) Thanks for the support. I'm fine now. And I'm still with Chris. I'm happy.  Followed your advice, Allan, and it paid off.  You were right about a lot of stuff (except for that "ikaw kasi yung babae" thing hehehe). Thanks.  Thanks, Ayn, for being there.  Sorry kung naapekto yung band work ethic ko hehehe... hindi naman. nagkataon lang na i needed to do something drastic last Sunday.  Anyway, I'm excited to practice again and to hear the new version of "Today" hehehe.

      Last Sunday we had practice. Selena wasn't able to make it so kami lang apat. We were tripping out. We first thought that maybe we could do a cover of Joy Division's "Love Will Tear Us Apart" pero di pa kabisado ni Ralph yung song. Tapos na tripan namin magpakababa ng tingin sa sarili and we tripped on Smashing Pumpkins' "Today". Since sobrang dali ng kanta, pinahirapan namin and we ended up with an extended version of the song. Naging astig yung song kasi ginawa naming reggae/punk/metal.   How we wish na marinig ni Billy Corgan yung ginawa namin. Most probably he'll think, "Why haven't I thought of doing that before? Candyaudioline kicks ass! I'm nothing compared to them. All hail candyaudioline." Malas ni Corgan at hindi niya tayo kilala.   After the practice, naglolokohan kami. Pangalan namin kunwari: Smashin' Pumpin'. Si Allan si Billy's Organ, si Ralph si Ihang-iha, ako si D' Arte, si Roel si Jimmy Chamba lang. Ang korni namin diba? Ayos lang, korni rin yung tinugtog namin eh.   Billy Corgan, eat your heart out you sucker.  ========  Moving forward to last night... galing ako ng UP Fine Arts for a gig. Hinatid ko bassist ng isang experimental noise band sa Lagro. Tamang tama nasa Altered Native si Allan at Roel to man a Moonstar 88 gig. So dumaan narin ako. We had sisig. Sarap ng sisig dun. Minutes after I got there, dumating rin si Jay of Kamikazee. Nagulat kami kasi pareho lang pinanggalingan namin. Sana sabay nalang kami pumunta sa AN. Sandali lang kaming lahat dun. We went home past 2.

      hello! I'm here at Ayn's house waiting until we have to go to Buzz Night.  Spent the afternoon with her and Tristania.  It was fun. she's soooo cute! sorry na lang yung mga hindi pa nakakakita sa kanya...  oh well, ayn, I did say I was tight-assed then, didn't i? ;) anyway, we all enjoyed it after all. and the raising eyebrows thing, well, I told you it wasn't you (and I'm letting everyone who reads this know, too).  wala rin akong masusulat kasi wala namang nangyaring candy-related sakin this past week. Nanood lang ako ng Keka, and I heard the Bean Bag song in the background hehehe. Actually, I didn't even recognize it... until I heard that "OH, you snore so louuuud" part. Unmistakably Allan's gay voice hehe. joke.  Tomorrow, Allan promises to take candyaudioline out to a movie. yehey!wala lang... yun lang ang masusulat ko.

      I'll let you know asap kung makapunta ako sa inyo sa Friday. Hopefully maaga matapos ang meeting ko on that day. Kung matutuloy ako, try ko isama sila Mia if they're free. Try niyo rin ni Chris makadaan sa amin on Saturday to visit my lovely daughter. He he.. Kung libre kayo.  Ehem... I was the one who brought up the "Nymphets" thing on air. I just thought that maybe it could liven up our discussion that's why I did that. I brought that up during the time when everyone inside the booth was on "dead air." Francis was sort of begging us then to speak up because he didn't know how to start the interview and I distinctly remember hearing him say, "C'mon guys please speak up..." and "Nymphets" was the first thing that came to mind. I never thought of our Nymphets escapades as something too private to mention to other people (perhaps you've forgotten that we mentioned that during our PULP interview months ago and it was ok for all of us). Besides, the way I brought it up wasn't done in a manner that would make listeners cringe or think of us as perverted bastards. And it did liven up the discussion even for just two minutes. I didn't know that you would feel that way about it. Far as I know, the whole interview went ok except maybe for the part where we all felt bad about how crappy our EP sounded on air. All of a sudden, I feel sick about myself. So what else made you raise your eyebrow?

       Hello, peeps. As you all know, we went on “In The Raw” last night on NU 107.  We were sharing the booth with Soft Pillow Kisses, Spring Boutique, and Popular Days, mostly because we all share some members. Let me just show a lineup to give you an idea:  Candyaudioline Ayn Roel Ralph Me Allan  Soft Pillow Kisses Allan Louie Lara John Paul Charles  Popular Days Charles John Paul Eric ***  Spring Boutique Charles John Paul Lei Antz  This caused Francis Reyes to dub the episode “Allan Montero In the Raw Night”.  He was pretty overwhelmed by our number at first, but he knew how to handle us after a while.  It was confusing for us, too… Allan didn’t want us to go one by one because it would seem too serious of us, when most of had already been on the show before.  He wanted it to be something like “Here we are with our new songs and we just want to have fun on the air”.  Uh-huh.  It was ok.  It was pretty weird in the booth because we were all cracking jokes and people kept taking pictures… basta ang gulo namin talaga!  But I was surprised to hear part of the taping afterwards because we didn’t seem as noisy as we really were in the booth.  Well, for those of you who listened, you know how it turned out.  All in all, it was a fair episode.  I think everyone enjoyed it a lot.  Call me anal, but I had some problems about last night.  I remember months before when someone suggested that we do “In The Raw” along with Popular Days and Allan said something like, “Magmamanyakan lang tayo dun… huwag!”  Well, that’s what happened last night.  I mean jokes are ok and all… but I just wish nobody had mentioned Nymphettes or Romeo’s or whatever.  I like them as private jokes, but for us to bring it up on the air was just plain too crass for me.  Don’t get me wrong. I LOVE Popular Days and all our other friends from indie bands who patronize those places.  I just didn’t think Nymphettes was appropriately mentioned last night.  And of course, there were other things that were put into focus last night that made me raise my eyebrows. I will not elaborate.   The preceding thoughts were written the morning after our NU guesting. However, I now feel that it was great. We did have fun, after all, and people were given a chance to hear the new stuff we had produced since the last album. Now they know we haven’t been sitting on our asses :)  One thing depresses me, though. Allan and Ralph got to hear how our songs sound on the radio, and they both were disappointed.  We all feel that the finished product doesn’t come close to how we had originally envisioned the songs.  Because of this, they’re actually considering not releasing the EP anytime soon. Boohoo. I talked to Allan about it. I asked him why not, when we all had agreed to release it even if it wasn’t up to par, and THEN do well on the next release.  He said, “I understand how you guys still aren’t thinking on the band level and want to release the EP just to be able to tell people that we’ve produced something.  But in the long run, if we release it now knowing it’s not good, you’ll be regretting your decision.  It’ll hurt to turn out something mediocre now.”  And we saw his point, even if it depressed us. It’s true… the guitars weren’t given the emphasis we had wanted. And the drums sound sucky (not entirely Roel’s fault).  So now, we’re wondering what to do. Should we record them again? That would be hell on our pockets (Allan’s and Ralph’s) and we don’t know how soon we’ll be able to release it after that.  Should we have it remixed at this place Allan knows?  That would be expensive AND time consuming for sure.  We’re trapped by our own perfectionism… at the same time, we’re not really sorry that we are.  This is the way we think.  Meanwhile, you can download the current versions of our 4 songs somewhere on Soulseek (I think Ralph put them there).  Time will tell about the EP…

      Personally, Ayn, you don’t have to worry about apologizing because I think you’re right.  If you only knew there were persons from Narda on our mailing list, I’m sure you would have expressed your opinion in a more palatable manner… hindi ka rin naman kasi bastos, ‘di ba? Just opinionated ;) And that’s fine.  Anyway, I re-read your post about Katwo and I think that person who reacted got it out of context a little… you said nakakahiya siya kung siya yung nagging vocalist ng candyaudioline.  In a way, totoo naman yun in the sense that she may be too flamboyant for the band.  Your comment was said in that context and you didn’t mean it as an attack on her person.  But I feel that it was admirable of you to apologize just because it shows you’re civilized and care about what our listers think.  Kailangan din naman natin silang respetuhin kasi they made the first step in reaching out to us by signing up for our mailing list.  Pero siyempre, we can only do so much… we don’t have to bow down to their every complaint.  I wrote that “prerogative” thing to remind everyone in the list that we are all entitled to express our opinions on the list, which necessarily means we have to take everything that’s said there with a grain of salt.  If you want to apologize for what you say, that’s well and good… but people who demand it must also accept circumstances if you don’t. It just so happened that you did apologize… well, that helps public relations.  In our mailing list, we practice pluralism hehe.  We can’t help but do so because we chose an open membership.  Marami tayong pananaw dun dahil iba-iba yung mga musical tastes natin.  I didn’t write that to chastise you or that other person.  It’s a reminder meant for all members.  Ok lang yun. Mailing list lang yun hehehe…  astig nga kasi kahit papano active yung satin, tapos semi-intelligent discussion pa!

      Some debate (?) is going on in our mailing list regarding the term indie.  So what   else is new?   This dude commented that "it's funny, it's all about play on semantics." What's not? Dear, in our generation nothing escapes from semantics. If some people can't get or accept the "facts" that were given on our list, that's their problem. Too bad for them. Then there's this other dude who remarked that I should have kept some of my opinions to myself regarding Narda. Stupid of me that I apologized for that. I shouldn't have. Selena was right:  It's our prerogative to say anything we want and it's our prerogative too if we want to   apologize for it . We can say anything we want in there. It's  OUR  mailing list. Again, Selena was right. They can unsubscribe any time they want, for all I care. Besides, there were no intentions on my part to diss that band in their faces. How should I know that some of the members or their friends signed up to our list? Most of them don't talk there. If I knew that they were there, I wouldn't have said things that I normally wouldn't say in presence of people who I was pertaining to (except for one Mayric's incident). Sheesh.

      Hoy hoy hoy hoy hoy hoy! Ang saya kagabi, kaya lang bitin.  Allan and Roel had to rush off to Mayric’s and Ralph and Ayn had to be ready for school/work the next day.  I had to go home and get some rest.  Tonight, we’ll be one of the last to play.  Ayn and I were the latest to arrive at Kafe.  We had to set up almost immediately, which made the both of us nervous.  But Allan showed us the printout he made of our recent blog entries and we all started laughing over it.  Roel was indignant at all the fun we were poking at him (but I think he also loves the attention). Ralph said he’ll be posting something soon. God. This is turning into a really weird blog.  Guess we’re making up for lost time.  We had a good set, in spite of my little piyoks hehe. We sang “All Smiles” and “Can’t Sleep”—the people looked like they enjoyed them, and it was good to sing those old songs again.  It was a different candyaudioline last night, and I think we were all more relaxed and enjoying it than usual.  We had to leave soon after, though.  The Matilda girls were outside with Jovan, their manager. ALL of them, even Meh!  It was good to see her looking fully recovered. Ralph took our pictures.  So… I hope we have more fun tonight.  Don’t forget to catch us there. Sonnet LXVIII will be there, so you know you’ll have a good night.

      Since si Roel hindi naman nagco-contribute dito, I just decided na ako na ang mag type tungkol sa kanya. Here goes….  I met Roel sometime end of 2000 sa Verve Room. I was with two of my friends from the goth scene (Annejo and her boyfriend that time, Aids of Prominence of Cathedrals). We went there for a couple of drinks. Then this kanto-boy/amay looking dude approached our table. He showed us this piece of paper with list of CD’s that his friend was selling. I then thought, “Ah waiter pala to. Ayos ah nagbebenta rin ng CD’s. Siguro utusan ni Hank”. Hank was the part-owner of Verve Room and is now part of the management of the new Big Sky Mind. I think. Anyway, as this dude approached us, he said, “Hi! Ako si Roel. Mahilig ba kayo sa mga Gothic (he pronounced it as gotik)?” We then answered hesitantly, “Uh… bakit?” Tapos sabi ni Roel, “Kasi nagbebenta friend ko ng mga CD’s baka interesado kayo.” He then showed us the list of CD’s, “Ayan o, may Theatre of Tragedy, mga gothic compilation, ayan o diba.” My friends and I looked at each other and smirked. We got the piece of paper anyway.  Months after, the first goth gathering after how many years (the last one was 1995) was held at Ritual de lo Habitual. I went there with my friends and their bands who were playing for that night. I saw Roel again. I was surprised and thought, “Bakit andito yung waiter ng Verve?” Then I saw Hank. Ah baka sinama lang ni Hank. This time mukha talagang waiter si Roel with his white poet shirt and black vest. Then nagulat ako when Five Wounds played. I think that was their first gig sa goth gatherings so people were waiting for their set. Roel played lead guitars for the band. Naisip ko ulit, “Aba ang waiter marunong pala mag gitara. With matching feel na feel looks pa.” He was doing that “lip thing” that he’s doing now while playing drums with Candyaudioline.   A couple of months passed by again then there was another goth gathering in Makati at a place called Bistro 101 (if I got the name right). Nung set na ng banda ni Roel nun, he was carrying his guitar papuntang stage. Ako naman, I was thinking na familiar mukha niya. I thought at first na baka kabanda ng Skies of Ember (that night was Skies’ first gig sa goth gatherings) so I waved at him and told him, “Good luck sa set niyo ha.” Tapos ngiti naman sha. Later I learned na dinagukan sha ng gf niya that time kasi akala baka nakikipag landian sa kin.  I was drunk that night and when the gig ended and Roel with his minions were about to leave, I told him, “Hey I know you, right?!” He answered, “Yeah! Verve Room right?!” Aba nag English si mokong. Dun ako naging sure na Five Wounds pala yung band niya (weeks later their drummer became my boyfriend). 	 The next day, my friend who happens to be ½ of the organizer for the goth gatherings called me up telling me that guys from Five Wounds wanted to get my number. He was asking me if it’s ok with me. I told him it’s ok and he answered, “Are you sure?” then he told me stuff about Roel. My friend didn’t give them my number but in some other way Roel and their drummer still managed to get my number from someone else. God, these people were desperate.   During my first conversations with Roel over the phone and through text, there were many times na pa-away ang mga sinasabi niya. I wondered, “bat pa ko tinatawagan kasi nito.”  We were able to hang out at this Consortium event. I was supposed to be on a date with their drummer and was very irritated that it was Roel who kept on talking to me. Ang kulit! So I decided to leave their group and just hang out with Dott and some people from Buzznite na nakita ko dun.  Dumaan ang madaming buwan…. I was already going steady with their drummer. Roel learned that I play for some indie band. It was funny because everytime I attended their rehearsals, dadating sha in full indie get-up. (As if I’d be impressed by that)  Tapos dumating yung time when Candy was desperate for a drummer. Since we were so desperate, Allan tried asking my then boyfriend to play for us during one Buzznite. Eh nagkataon kasama ng bf ko si Roel at narinig ang pinag-uusapan, ayun at sumingit si Amay at sobrang excited sa pagsabi, “Ako nalang!”  Pumayag ako since I don’t want to be bandmates with anyone na ka steady ko. Besides, my boyfriend was telling me before na ok daw pumalo si Roel when he was still with bands like Apostate and Barang. I believed him. At first hindi ok yung practice namin with Roel pero ayos lang since hindi pa naman sha familiar sa songs.   Nowadays, nagtataka lang ako kung ano na nangyari sa kanya. But I’m still proud of him. There are some gigs na ok talaga sha, even if there are more gigs na nasisira ang set because of him too.  Yun yung story ni Roel. But I think it would be better kung makuha natin yung side niya.  +++++++  Kay Ralph naman, Joey had to quit Candy because of me. That was before Roel came in. At first, si Jerome ng Daydream at Teeth ang nag guitar for Candy pero nawalan na rin ng gana later on. Again, because of me. Bwahahahaha!   Anyway, marami kaming options nun. Isa dun si Diego ng Monsterbot. Sabi ni Allan fan daw ng candy si Diego pero ayaw ni Allan na sha sana ang pumalit kay Joey. Ako naman since I thought that Diego looks cute and all, I was hoping na sha nalang para naman magkaron ng pogi sa banda. Eh ayaw talaga ni Allan. Then he started texting us na nakahanap na sha ng permanent guitarist. Friend daw niya. Una kong tanong, “pogi ba?” Sabi ni Allan ok lang. Since wala naman talaga akong control sa decisions ni Allan, bahala nalang talaga.  Unang practice namin with Ralph, I was a bit disappointed because he didn’t look as cute as I expected him to be. So tinanong ko nalang, “Ano mga pinapakinggan mo?” He answered (na parang irritable pa na kinukulit ko sha), “Parokya.” Naisip ko, “Nyek. Patay.”  He played well for a first practice. But I still tried persuading Allan into getting Diego instead of him. Allan insisted na ok si Ralph, at kung tutuusin mas marunong pa yan kay Diego basta lang ma familiarize sha sa genre ng Candy. And he was so right.  I know there was even this one time when I complained to Allan that Ralph’s guitar style was “so Parokya”. Nagalit sakin si Ralph nun. Take note, sa sobrang gago ko, sa akin nagalit sa Ralph. To think, if it weren’t for that instance never talaga nagagalit si Ralph ng ganun.  Di nagtagal, I was proven wrong. Now, Ralph is the source of pride for Candyaudioline.

      Ayos ah. Reminiscing mode tayo. I met Allan through IRC. Channel ng Ateneo. That was mid-2000. During the time when I just quit some mediocre UP band that thinks Smashing Pumpkins is the best band in the world. I was made to quit because some faggot by the name of Pog wanted to snatch my position. I gave in and quit. They sucked anyway. Out of frustration, I just auditioned for 2 all-girl riot gurl bands that time, Apian and Anemia. My peers who share the same type of music that I really like were very worried about me because I kept on joining bands that play something I don't really like. Truth is, I just wanted to be in a band. Thing is, they all happen to play something I don't like. I promised myself then that I will never join a band that won't fit me. What more indie?   Anyway going back to me and Allan. He posted, "WHO WANTS TO BE A VOCALIST FOR A BAND CALLED SOFT PILLOW KISSES." Ako naman, I saw what he posted by accident. I was just waiting for an old friend to enter the channel then I saw Allan's post. I know I've heard of SPK somewhere so I decided to trip on Allan because I was sure that their type of music was something that I will never like. So I macked him. I asked him what type of music they're playing. He said "indie". I answered, "Oh ok. Well I don't know shit about indie." Then I closed the window. Allan was persistent. He asked, "So what type of music are you into?" I replied, "something dark", thinking that he wouldn't know shit about what I'm really into anyway. Ang bilis mag reply ni Allan, "Ah goth." I was surprised that he knows what I'm talking about. I said yes, then closed the window again. Tapos ayan na naman sha, "How old are you?" Sagot ulit ako, "18." I was thinking then, "tangina to ah. Hindi ba niya pansin na hindi ako interesado?" Then on second thought naisip ko why won't I give it a shot. I've always wanted to sing for a band. I've tried it only once years ago for a band that covers Cranberries and Lisa Loeb (kakahiya no) so why not try it again? Eh si mokong humirit, "nga pala I also have another band. we're looking for a bassist." Since he mentioned the word bassist, dun agad napunta attention ko. I said, "Ako. bassist nalang!" So yun.  Allan and I talked over the phone first. He let me listen to Candy's first release "Paint Your Silver Smile." First reaction? "Yaak. Tang ina parang Fatal Posporos. Yak talaga." Then he mentioned something like, "Ayn sige, alis nako we still have a basketball game with guys from Greyhoundz and Parokya and Teeth." Inisip ko, "pucha bigtime tong gagong to ah."  Days after, we met up in UP. Sa tambayan ng org ko. He was with AJ. I was thinking na baka pogi sila (ganda ng boses ni Allan sa phone eh) at baka ma disappoint lang pag nakita ako. So I played hide and seek with them (sort of). Nagtago ako sa table when they arrived. Nung nakita ko na pangit pala sila, dun nako naging confident. Inisip ko rin, "ah wala wala lang yung banda nito." Allan gave me a tape for me to listen to. Pagtingin ko, naisip ko ulit, "Yak yellow yung cover. Ang baduy. At bat ganito mga title ng kanta. Yak talaga. Pero ayos ha, may pa tape-tape pa silang nalalaman."   I was already thinking that it was a big mistake that I decided to audition for them. See, it wasn't just Candy who thought na big mistake ang nangyari. Ako rin. Mutual yon.  To loosen all the tension, I invited them for drinks. Allan suggested that we go to 70's Bistro. I said, "ok. sige 70's." and I let them lead the way. Truth is, I haven't been to 70's Bistro that time! I let myself get drunk, mainly because I was so nervous about everything. About joining them and all. Not only because I thought they sounded stupid but also because I noticed that they were really serious about the band. That time, I also sensed the friction between me and AJ. I already knew that he didn't like me at all. Well, I didn't like him either but still decided to become friendly with him and ask him about stuff that he's into. Thing is, ako pala ang mali. He suddenly started talking about me behind my back. He thought I was tripping out on him but I wasn't! Naging grabe pa when I offered him a gum. Akala niya, I did that because I thought he had bad breath.   Anyway, fast forward to first practice. I sucked big time. They all thought that I'm already familiar with the songs because Allan gave me a tape. Truth is, I only listened to it once kasi di ko na kaya talaga pakinggan. I only liked "Flaming Walls" and "We've Been There" because they're catchy songs. Up to this day, yun parin ang gusto ko lang sa tape na yon. Main reason why I hate playing the old songs.  Si Allan, natiis ako. My first gig was at some University Gym somewhere in Manila. Na shock naman ako. Tang ina ang daming tao for a first gig. I did well that night but I sucked for the next gigs. My being a sucky bass player went on for more than a year. I was worse than Roel, would you believe. Pano ba naman, aside from not being familiar with the songs, I listen to Dead Can Dance, Therion and Diabolical Masquerade pag papunta sa gigs. Siempre pag tutugtog na, nakalimutan ko na songs ng Candy. ( I know I still do that nowadays pero minsan lang)  Sometime mid-2001.... It was during the night when Candy gave birth to "Better View" that I started playing better and Candy got what they really deserve from a bassist. The rest is history.

      Okay, sorry! My apologies to Lara and the real first candyaudioline bassist.  Thank you, Allan, for that history lesson.  Even I learned something from it. Now we all know that the band is really a front for you to meet girls. Shucks.  You know, it’s funny because I actually had the same idea (not the one about meeting girls).  I was thinking of putting my first experience with candy on this blog.  Here goes:  Ayn and I have this mutual friend, Mia.  I had already been introduced to Ayn before at Big Sky Mind but I didn’t get to talk to her much after that. At Big Sky, I was drunk and I asked her if I could have some of her beer—I promptly took a swig… she just had this amused look on her face.  Afterwards, Mia told me that I had a death wish because Ayn NEVER likes anyone touching HER beer.  I kept that in mind. Ayn is always so quiet around new people (at least, when she’s not drunk or feeling like tripping on other people hehehe), and I was a bit intimidated by her gothicity(!), so I left her alone whenever we got the chance to drink with Mia.  One night, Mia invited both of us to drink with her at a nearby carinderia.  Ayn was telling Mia that their vocalist just quit, and then she turned to me and asked, “Do you sing?”  I was surprised, but I said yes.  She invited me to her band’s practice that Sunday and said that they played indie music.  My corresponding thought was, “Whatever THAT means…” and then I said, “Um… okay. I guess it wouldn’t hurt to try. Sure, I’ll be there.”  So we had a date.  Incidentally, that was also the night Ayn dropped the bombshell of her being pregnant on us, but that’s another (very interesting) story…  So Ayn picked me up Sunday night and we headed on to Mang Sam’s. I remember dressing up to look my best (para good impression, hehe).  I was very nervous, but I was pleasantly surprised by Ayn’s solicitous behavior towards me.  She talked a lot about the band, I guess to prepare me for the weirdness.  But nothing prepared me for the sight that first greeted me as I stepped out of Ayn’s car.  There were three men who approached the car, none of whom looked like the type of bandmates I imagined Ayn had.  I had always thought Ayn’s bandmates would be young, cool, cute, college boys… the ones who approached were obviously older; one looked like a weird version of Marvin Agustin, one had long hair and looked like, um, someone you would avoid when walking down the street, and the last looked like the Kingpin, if he were Filipino and couldn’t afford spiffy suits.  I could feel myself starting to rehearse a “Sorry-but-I-don’t-think-I-can-do-it” speech in mind as Ayn introduced me to Gilbert, Roel and Allan.  I was scared out of my wits.  Ayn told me that Gilbert was a member, with Allan, of Soft Pillow Kisses, a band whose songs were being played sometimes on NU 107. I hadn’t heard of them.  Inside, I was introduced to Ralph and Charmaine… they looked more like band people, but still not the type I’d associate with Ayn.  Allan gave me his discman to listen to the songs.  I found them catchy, but the accent weirded me out.  Still, I thought they were pretty original, and I wanted to see if I could do it.  He then proceeded to teach me ELEVEN (11) songs. God.  I was so afraid of him that I pushed myself to learn them all.  I think he was so excited that we were going at such a fast pace.  He struck me then as very businesslike.  By the end of the night, I had a better idea of what candyaudioline was, but I was starting to have serious doubts as to whether I could stay up that late and handle the workload.  I asked Allan if this was going to be an everyday thing… he and Ayn said, no, it wasn’t going to be hectic, at all.  They seemed to think I was satisfactory, so they kept me.  They asked me if I was ready to go in a few days because they had a gig lined up… I quickly declined and asked for another practice before I could perform.  They agreed and said I could sing the gig after the next, which was the EP launch of Skies of Ember at Club Sex.  I went home that night feeling really tired.  I didn’t think I was going to like being in a band, but I wasn’t completely sure of that, either.  Chris urged me all week to give it a try.  I arrived at our second practice feeling reluctant and apprehensive.  Allan kept correcting me the whole night.  Normally, I wouldn’t have minded, but I was thinking that if he had so many problems with the way I sang, why didn’t he just drop me.  I was starting to get frustrated and embarrassed.  I was especially peeved at him saying that I had a “p and f” problem (interchanging the sounds when I pronounce certain words).  I kept telling him it was because of the braces I had then, that I was still getting used to them.  We even had a debate about the way I pronounced the word “common”, which I thought I pronounced very well.  I think he wanted me to say kah-min, which to me, sounded like an exaggerated American accent. Haha… it’s funny to think of it now.  He wasn’t being mean, but his comments didn’t help my insecurity at that point.  Suddenly, I broke down crying in the middle of a song while he was teaching me one-on-one.  He was flummoxed… he panicked and asked me what was wrong. He kept apologizing.  I told him it wasn’t his fault. I was just feeling vulnerable and under pressure.  I even told him about my carnap experience from the month before. I told him everything in my life was just piling up at that moment.  He decided to give me a break then and apologized for making me miserable with his perfectionism.  We went outside to join the others.  He told them I had cried!  At first, I was embarrassed, but he started laughing about it and teasing me… and he also assured me that I shouldn’t feel pressured by him because he only thought I could very well take all that work.  At that moment, I realized he wasn’t really out to get me or anything and that this was all supposed to be fun.  I relaxed after that and actually had fun hanging out with them.  Now, I’m so grateful that I didn’t chicken out when Ayn asked me to be candy’s vocalist. I’m so happy that I didn’t let Allan’s anal retentive nature (oh yes, maybe this says something about his sexuality, too, hehe… joke lang, Allan! Peace!) scare me away.  I’m so relieved that I didn’t judge the books by their covers (because, I’m not a judge)… HAHAHA! Suffice it to say, I love my band. The people are great and the experiences are such a laugh. Really. Para kaming comedy film.  I just got a message that we’re not going to practice tonight.  Aww, shucks.  No “It’ll Never Last” cover for us. No hanging out, either. Boo.

      hi   here's a bit of history for my current bandmates and for those who care about candyaudioline.   candy's first bassist was a girl from up named obie. she happened to be one of my closest friend at that time ('97). by early '98 she was replaced by bing who was recommended by romel of sonnet 58. not much of a pretty face but she was definitely a real bassist unlike obie who was more of magazine pin-up figure than a band material.   by middle of '98, bing quit the band after candy's first "in the raw" appearance. (she later admitted that she was only after radio exposure) she was later replaced by then 15 year-old beejay who at that time had no idea on how to play the bass but got admitted into the band for three reasons: one - she owns one of the most visually attractive and ultra-light bass guitar with one of the coolest brand  names (megabass) ever, two - this girl is very pretty and ooozzing with sex appeal and three - yours truly had a very big crush on one of her friends. she had a short stint as candy-bassist because she was to migrate to the states. this signalled the return of obie who at that time , really improved on her skills. first as a sessionist bassist then decided to join in as things were beginning to shape up for the band. that didn't last long because after 3 months, she decided to quit the band (along with our original vocalist) to concentrate with her studies. beejay was taken back in because her magration was still up in the air and she didn't enrolled that school year. a month later obie returned along with cheng. beejay and then new candy vocalist apol got booted out. not wanting to get separated from beejay and specially apple, yours truly decided to form another band which eventually became soft pillow kisses. that was '99. candy (and pillow) never had line-up problems from that time until early 2000 when obie decided again to leave the band for good due to commitment problems. lara was introduced to me by a friend but before that me and beejay already saw lara playing guitars for then up and coming YUCKPOP quintet _________. she played bass for candy for about a year or so before quitting the band for reasons beyond the grasp of human comprehension.  beejay sessioned once in while until yours truly met ayn through irc chat. admittedly we thought that getting ayn was a mistake because aside from her being drunk 25 hours out of a 24 hour day. she was then very slow in learning some of the songs (one of the reasons why joey quit the band). i stuck out with her anyway because aside from the free rides she offers, her attitude towards the band was really heart warming. she was all-out for candy. well it paid off, 5 months into candy ayn was really letting lose. contributing not only in money and transpo but also putting in her own bass lines at that... at present, she's still there and hopefully will be there until the time that we decide to end candyaudioline and focus on our being EATFREAKS... HEHEHE.   by the way, during the latter part of ayn's pregnancy, we got the services of sonia. she played three gigs for candy two as bassist and one as singer. she now sing for a ska band whose name i can't recall...  ayus bah?

      Lara was not the original bassist. If I'm not mistaken, she's second. She replaced Obie. And I replaced her. That makes me the third (or fourth If I didn't get that right).  Yep, last night's the best practice we've had.   Good karma good karma.

      We just had the best practice we have had together since we completed this lineup of candyaudioline last year.  This was last night, of course.  Ayn picked me up at around 9 pm… we arrived there and found Charles and John Paul, Jeff indie and Ants and the vocalist of Spring Boutique.  They said Allan was inside one of the rooms, teaching Louie (the new SPK vocalist) some songs.  Ralph and Lara arrived soon after… since candy wasn’t complete yet, Spring Boutique decided to make use of the studio first.  Roel was nowhere to be seen.  We talked outside for a while.  I was so glad to be around candymates again.  We were already getting worried about time passing, so we went inside the other room and started practicing even without drums.  We all agreed that we should start playing some of the old songs so that we wouldn’t seem one-dimensional.  It was great.  It was so refreshing to go back over candyaudioline’s discography.  The semi-practice served as rehearsal for acoustic sets, too, so the time didn’t entirely go to waste.  It was actually funky after a while because Lara decided to jam with us on the drums… I think she still remembers how some of the drum lines go from her old job as the first candy bassist.  It was really fun, even without Roel, but of course we were a little bothered that we couldn’t really launch into full blast without him on the drums.  Right after we finished, Roel arrived.  We were all, “Oh well… what else is new?” and he kept apologizing (we later found out that he had been delayed because he finished watching the telecast of the Filipinas Awards on MTV!).  Ayn suggested we go eat at Pares again, but Allan said that we should wait for him to finish with Pillow.  So we waited again. It wasn’t so bad; we had a lot of catching up to do, actually.  Ralph and Ayn were worried, though, that it was getting late as they both had school/work the following morning.  We considered practicing, the four of us (without Allan), jus to make use of Roel’s presence, only we realized we had no money to pay for the extra studio use.  Fortunately, Allan decided to cut Pillow practice short and to make use of the last half hour for a complete candy practice.  Ok… so there we were… we told Roel we’d like to do all the old songs, and he was obviously pleasantly surprised at the change. Aba—ang galing namin! We were focused, but also having fun.  And we were tight! Allan said to Roel, “Ikaw ba yan?” We were absolutely DELIGHTED with him last night.  It was funny because Roel was all blushing and humble when we kept complimenting him. Hah! But we were really happy with those 30 minutes.  Allan was planning to practice only 4 songs, but since we performed flawlessly, we were able to play around 8. We were even able to perfect our cover of “Today”.  We stepped out of the studio feeling exhilarated.  Ralph said, “Ok lang magpa-late, basta sulit ang practice!”  At that moment, it felt really good to be part of the band.  We all headed on to Partners Pares near Millenia.  Surprise! Roel decided to come along! We all fattened ourselves and our egos up.  Ang sarap.  It seemed a pity to break the party up at 3 am.  Jeff was telling Ayn that we should drink at her house, but she had class a few hours later and everyone was unmistakably tired.  We went home feeling excited about Wednesday’s performance.  Tuesday, we’re practicing again just to make sure our good karma takes full effect.  I love my band! Group huuuuuuuuuuuuuug… *snicker, snicker*

      All right. I can finally update the blog promptly because I have fixed my computer. I haven’t been this hands-on with the computer since 2000.  Last night, I had dinner with Chris in Katipunan.  It was 7 pm and I needed to get home badly in order to change and study some of the SPK songs for the Moonstar 88 bar tour at Streetlife.  We waited and waited under the rain with only a poncho to hold over our heads.  I think we must have been there for half an hour before a taxi finally came and took pity on us.  I got really wet and I was afraid that my usual sniffles were going to worsen because of that.  I dressed and contacted Allan for details about the gig.  Charles ended up fetching me at around 9:15 pm… John Paul was with Allan coming from the Moonstar gig in Pampanga and they were supposed to pick Lara up.  Charles and I arrived at Glorietta before some of the important Backbeat people.  Allan and the rest arrived 15 minutes later.  It was ok.  I thought I did a good job because the sound system was better… I could hear my voice clearly while I was singing.  Only, Roel approached us afterwards and said my voice was too soft.  Allan said the monitor onstage was loud, so we couldn’t have realized whether we were singing loud enough or not. Sayang.  Allan told me Acel of Moonstar commented that we sang well, but she said it was a pity that I wasn’t really moving onstage.  He told her that that’s really the way he likes it when Pillow performs. Thanks, though, Acel :)  Ralph and Ayn texted us during while we were waiting for the event to finish.  Ralph was telling us that we had some durian all the way from his General Santos farm.  He wanted us to pick it up after the gig.  Ayn was sulking because we hadn’t invited her to the tour.  Sorry, Ayn!!! I honestly thought you were too busy this weekend because of your short film, so I thought it more polite not to ask.  Well, at least I mentioned my wish to see you guys on the blog, hehehe… Sayang pala, no?  Anyway, after the show, Popo of Moonstar brought us to Timog so we could catch a cab to Ralph’s place.  We picked up the durian and they brought me home.  Allan and Charles and Melanie (this Moonstar fan who hitched with us) hung out at Ralph’s some more.  This morning, Ayn passed by the house for her share of the durian.  She was with Jarek, her jogging partner.  She looked cute in her jogging get-up hehehe.  I suddenly realized when I was handing her the durian how little I had brought home.  Even my mom finished what I left here in one sitting!  To think that Ralph had said that I could get as much as I wanted… pero nahiya rin kasi ako.  Sayang. Sabi pa naman ni Ralph na wala na daw… sigh.  Tonight, we have practice.  I am so excited to see my candymates again! Don’t forget to pass by our gigs on the 20th and the 21st! Buh-bye!  By the way… I askd Allan last night about the EP… he said walang problema daw yun.  So I guess we have to trust him about that…

      In BeTWEEn Days was great… except that I had to go home early. Darn. Chris’s parents were home from the States so we had to drive over to this wholesome KTV in the Escape before going to Millenia.  So you know… I was all skittish because I brought the car and Mom was texting me to come on home already.  Chris was sleepy, too, but I did wish that I could have hung out with the candymates a little longer. I hope the next gig proves more conducive to bonding.  I didn’t like the mics at Millenia because no matter how loud I sang, you just couldn’t hear me… or if you could, it would be unintelligible. I don’t think it’s entirely because of the way I sing because other sound systems are fine.  But, you know, I guess it might not be Millenia’s fault. Hwehehey! Did everyone read that correctly??? Yup, I’m actually defending Millenia.  Well, in fairness to them, they haven’t treated me or anyone I know badly since that time.  And Tiffany is nice to me, too… but, of course, I’m still shy. I’d just rather not talk much there. Sing and get it over with. You know.  That Orange and Lemons (tama ba?) band was pretty good, too… but I agree with Ayn that it just seemed too weird for me when they sang their Tagalog song with British accents. It’s almost up there with “Little Boy”. But not quite…  I’m sessioning for pillow again this Saturday at Streetlife. Pillow na naman… paano na yung candy? Boohoo. But I like singing for pillow, too, just because they have cute songs and it’s relaxing (albeit nerve-wracking).  They already have someone new for vocals, but since Allan’s not that confident about her just yet, he wants me to cover for the next stint.  Sana Makita ko yung ibang candy members dun… pero longshot.  Okay. I’m sleepy.

      Hey, Peeps! I’m not sure kung tuloy tayo this Friday kasi tinanong ko lang si Allan kung may upcoming gig tayo and he said maybe then… it’s another kamikazee bar tour thing… but he’s thinking baka hindi puwede kasi lagare yata siya nun. Anyway, basta ba namang I-text niya tayo way before.  Yes, In BeTWEEn Days is on Sunday, but he also failed to mention last night kung kasama ang candyaudioline. Siguro naman ano… and, frankly, I miss the grit of our own songs after a whole day’s worth of singing out of my nose: “I can’t believe you’d saaaaaaaaaaay…”!!!  Yesterday afternoon, Allan and Charles and John Paul and I had a call-conference and it was a surreal experience.  Ang gulo nilang kausap! Nagbabastusan lang silang lahat dun hehehe… basta. Allan and I settled on a mini-playlist for my softpillowkisses session last night.  I had been hoping to sing “80’s Fan” so that I have one less song to learn (he only gave me the lyrics that same morning!), but he said Lara had dibs on that already.  So we settled on: Harsh Words, I Don’t Know What to Say, It Will Never Last, Stay for a While, and Bathing in the Sun.  I spent the afternoon memorizing, or trying to, the songs and the tunes.  Actually, it would have been fun if only I weren’t under time pressure.  I like the simple lyrics and the dainty melodies… but I would have had an easier time if the songs didn’t sound so much alike.  It was hard to make sense of which is which. By the time Charles and John Paul had arrived to fetch me, I was so nervous and I could hardly clutch my cheat sheets.  We fetched Lara at her boyfriend’s condo, then headed on to Blue Onion.  We arrived there before Allan did.  They had a fricking dress code, man… leather shoes… and “smart and stylish” dapat. My ass. It was a Moonstar 88 bar tour.  Blue Ketchup did covers to a half-empty restaurant, but their familiarity attracted more customers.  So it was our turn.  Ang tagal ng soundcheck. Nagtatae pa yung BAGONG gitara ni Charles. Tapos nawalan sa tono yung gitara ni Allan.  Lara did about 3 songs and then Allan called me.  I couldn’t take the crowd.  They were so quiet… and bored.  I didn’t even bother “reaching out to them”, I really just stared at the Mild Seven ashtray on the table in front of the stage.  Anyway, we finished.  We waited for Moonstar to finish, too.  There were very few people there, but I’d really have to hand it to Acel—she made them feel good.  I was really tired by the end of the night.  Allan really liked our set… he said, bagay daw yung boses ko sa pillow songs. That was such a laugh. Me, of all people.  So he felt like practicing.  We went to Mang Jun’s.  We practiced for about an hour.  It was cool. But I really miss candy.  One thing I noticed about pillow… I really like their professionalism.  I don’t know if it was just that night.  When they practice, lahat sila focused.  Although focused yung most members ng candy pag practice, parang kulang pa rin.  I can’t put my finger on it. Maybe it’s just my imagination.  Ok. I had fun last night. But Allan wants to make me temporary vocalist while they search for a new one. Damn. More work for me. Pero ok lang. Masaya. Ayoko lang talaga sa mga matataas na songs. It’s not me.  Baka isipin ng ibang tao babae ako hehehe.

      Saan ang gig this Friday. Text me asap kung tuloy at kung saan. Nga pala, I just heard that the next In between Days is this Sunday. Kasama ba tayo dun? Let me know. I got shit loads of work to do.  A friend also asked me if we can play for this UP bands thing that they're planning to organize at Millennia. It might be regular for this month, I think. Since UP students/alumni naman ang tatlo satin (plus si Roel na mejo questionable pa ang credibility), I just thought na baka puede tayo. Ano? Papatulan ba natin itong pa-gig na to?  Text-an nalang.

      Hello, everyone. I’m back.  Medyo ayos na yung computer namin so makakapost nako… sa wakas.  It’s not functioning as well as before, though. Too bad.  Anyway, who wants to hear about my computer problems?  Allan called me up yesterday asking me what copies I had of Softpillowkisses songs.  He was worried about the spk gig this Wednesday because he still didn’t have a vocalist.  I assume Eloha can’t make it.  I was a bit enthusiastic in volunteering… I don’t know why heehee. Baka kasi feeling ko kaya kong kumanta ng ganung kataas. But I told Allan to get me in case he couldn’t find anyone.  It would be an experience.  They’re playing in Libis this Wednesday.  There were some things missing from Ralph’s post about the last gig.  There was that thing Jay said while he was performing (drunk again, as usual ;).  He was about to thank the bands who had played before Kamikazee, when he noticed Ayn and me on the sidelines and he said: “Candyaudioline… ayun yung candyaudioline girls, oh… dalawa sila.  Kaya lang, mag-ingat kayo sa mga yan, malalakas yan uminom.  Pag lumapit kayo diyan, siguradong ubos yung pera niyo!” Shit. Nakakahiya pero nakakatawa. Yun tuloy yung impression ng Alabang crowd samin hehehe. Pero ok lang. Masaya talaga dun sa Rock Radio Café… I mean, it was an ok place to have a gig.  Oh yeah, and there was this other thing Ayn and I did.  Everyone was getting ready to go home.  The Backbeat entourage was one of the last to leave.  While sina Allan were taking care of business, Ayn and I noticed that there was this kid (or high school –aged guy) who kept pacing around, looking at his cellphone and checking the cars cruising by.  He was there so long and he was alone… Ayn and I were worried that he might be taken advantage of after we left.  So Ayn and I went up to him to offer him a ride home.  “Hi,” we said, “Gusto mo, ihatid ka na lang namin?”  He looked at us and laughed, embarrassed.  He must have thought we were nuts or drunk and really sweet, but I think napahiya siya kasi we obviously thought he was too young to be out at this time of night.  But he smiled and said in this certain tone, “No, it’s ok, my car’s on its way already.  And I’m only from BF,” that confirmed my suspicions that he was really older than he looked (he looked like a high school freshman).  Of course, when we left, he still hadn’t been fetched, and I couldn’t help feeling a twinge of worry for the Little Boy.   Oh, little booooyyyy… di you hear your mother screamiiinggg?  Did you see the angels clashiiinnngg…. snicker, snicker  Then, afterwards, we ate at Partners Pares and we talked about the EP. We’re definitely going to push through with it, finally.  We talked about the presentation and the bonus tracks.  We’re only waiting for the funds now (promise, totoo na yan).  Watch out for it in September.  That truly is good news.  And let us all pray that the Manyaks don’t influence Allan to spend all his money on their exploits. For the good of our music, man.  Allan says we might be playing this Friday.

      basta astig yung 2 straight na tugtog.  yung sa rock radio, it was a frustration of sorts for me since my amp had no sustain whatsoever, kahit na tinodo ko na yung reverb. even jomal lambasted the damned amp. pero ok na rin. medyo nakakailang gumalaw kasi ang sikip sa stage. nung kumakain kami sa henlin's after our set, some guys approached us and asked if we were the band that just played. we said yes. and they shot back, "galing nyo". i don't know if they were just being fake plastic trees or totoo talaga yung sinabi nila. if so, then we had a couple of new fans. hehehe. later that day, allan revealed that at least 3 persons approached him and asked when our record will come out. he thought na they were referring to SPK, so on the first 2 he said that they were still having some problems with shelflife. turns out that all the guys were asking for OUR record, so on the 3rd person, he just said, "wala pa kaming pera pang record".  ma-action din yung gig sa rock radio. some commotion happened outside the venue, which climaxed when someone broke a beer bottle on a pervert's head. figures. natapos lang nung dumating ang mga pulis at dinampot sila lahat.  then last night... music warehouse manila. i was antsy at first, then inantok. gusto ko nang tumugtog agad. we played after a showband and another band that was doing alternative covers. medyo nakakailang na naman gumalaw kasi namamatay matay yung gadget ko. damn it. kelangan ko nang bumili ng bago. anyway, i went home immediately after out set kasi antok na talaga ako.

      hi!  it's been a long while since i last posted here... the problem is my keyboard... it sucks! some of the keys don't bite back...  oh well, here it goes...  a while ago (or last night) we played at Rock Radio cafe' in alabang... i think we did well judging from the reactions from the people who watched us. we did our usual safe set thanks to our inability to practice for the past few months. the place was really nice (but still, nymphets rule!) especially the crowd... wish tha someday, mayrics could host such a crowd...  wait, phone call...       sorry have to cut this short... my dad just past away...

      Last night we fronted for Parokya lang pala.  Maple Syrup was there and one of the vocalists was wearing a Chester-of-Linkin-Park ensemble (glasses, polo shirt buttoned up to the top).  Ralph was wearing a polo shirt, too, and he buttoned it up to the top to make us laugh. Allan felt bad because none of us were able to go out with him the other night to a movie, when we had all promised we would.  Circumstances had been against us.  Roel was quiet last night, don’t know why.  Ayn drank some beer.  I drank some orange juice. Yum.  Then we played.  Couldn’t hear myself, but they said I could be heard.  Ayn and I left early.  The End. Bow.

      Once, I told a college acquaintance that there were still class distinctions in PSHS, like any normal high school.  There were the popular kids and there were the geeks.  He incredulously replied, “What??  Nerds persecuting  other  nerds?? Okay yun ah…”  The other night, we played at Buzz Night.  As expected, it was packed because of The Lubitels’ admirers.  Ayn and I arrived there at around 10 pm because Allan said Roel had another gig to go to afterwards.  As we were bringing the bass out of the van, we saw a guy wearing a red, hooded sweatshirt, cap and glasses entering Mayric’s.  “Uy, Ralph wears glasses?” I raised my eyebrows.  “Now he does.”  Well, at least he had arrived already.  We sat down at our usual table and he wasn’t there.  We thought he had gone to the bathroom.  Minutes later, he still hadn’t come to sit with us. “Maybe that wasn’t Ralph.  It sure looked like him. Tingnan ko nga.”  I made as if to go to the bathroom myself, but stopped when I saw a girl waiting in front of the door.  At least I could see “Ralph”.  I turned around to walk away, but took a last look at him—nope. Heehee.  Later, Ralph came in wearing a big ratty shirt.  He looked really tired and not his usual red-sweatshirted self.  “Still sick,” he said.  “We thought this guy sitting in front was you.”  “Really? Haha.”  So we sat around waiting for the rest of the troop.  Allan, Roel and John Paul were stuck in SM North and Charles was off to a date, according to Antz.  Antz gave Ayn and me a compilation he made of indiepop and we were delighted.  He had even made little sleeves for them and drawn a cover design of sorts with permanent marker. Very thoughtful of him.  Balloon Derby decided to be proactive by getting up to play even if the night hadn’t officially started.  They played a good, loud set, keyboards galore.  The crowd was pretty enthusiastic that night, and politely so.  After Balloon Derby, everyone waited a while for Allan to come around, but he was still nowhere to be seen.  Carnival Park rescued us from boredom with their “super twee” sound (a friend’s words, not mine).  Outside, Lei of Spring Boutique was begging Antz to let her leave for a party.  Charles and John Paul didn’t look like they were arriving any time soon.  Shucks… I was hoping to hear her sing that night.  Finally, Charles and Allan, Roel and John Paul hurried into Mayric’s. Candyaudioline immediately started setup.  I suddenly became very nervous just before I went onstage and it killed my first notes.  I tried not to think too much during the set, but I appreciated how we sound  so loud  during “An Empty You” and “Nothing Much to Lose”.  I recognized an unexpected friend from the audience and it relaxed me a bit.  The crowd was very polite. Really.  I was grateful.  Lara told us she really liked our set.  Ayn’s friend, the one who wants to use our music for a film score, was impressed, too.  She showed us her short film outside and we gave her the freedom to pick bits and pieces of our songs for her score.  Allan even toyed with the idea of making it a music video for “Empty” and she agreed heartily. It was a cool film and a good idea.  Allan bought me some orange juice.  Yummy.  I told Kaye that she looked like that girl from “My Love, Cindy” and she laughed so loud.  I told her that Charles had a look-alike from the Sexbomb Dancers, too.  It’s true.  Just watch “Daisy Siete”.  These two suspicious looking men wanted to sit down beside Kaye and me, but we gave them such odd looks that they opted to sit somewhere in front.  That was fortunate because it turned out that those two guys harassed a woman later that night. They claimed they were CIDG so the Buzz Night guys could do no more than make them leave the venue.  Kawawa yung babae.  She left soon after that in tears.  Soul Connection and The Lubitels played to an animated audience.  Spring Boutique played sans Lei, plus Lara.  Soft Pillow Kisses ended the night beautifully.  Was there a Shuffle Union? A Ciao?  I forget. I’m sorry… I must have stepped outside for some air.  Maybe they didn’t come.  The Einstein Chakras didn’t.  That was a pity.  I wanted to hear that “Johnny is a name of a dog in the Philippines” song.  I’m not sure I got that right, either.  Allan kindly treated some of us to Mister Kebab after Buzz Night for once.  He wanted to stay away from certain areas.  Ahem.  Before we left for the restaurant, the Ralph doppelganger went to get a taxi with his friends and I pointed him out to the real one.  “Yun o.”  Pause.  “He’s too healthy.”  Tonight, we’re fronting for Parokya and Kamikazee at Mayric’s.

      Puede rin yung sinasabi mo Ralph pero pag usapan nalang natin bukas.. I invited my friend to drop by Mayric's for Buzznite.   To Allan, padala naman copies ng mga songs natin (preferably yung Alone Again at Last at yung An Empty You) just in case.  To the rest of the band, in case makalimutan ni Allan magdala ng copy, kung may extra kayo, padala narin.  The film is about "the obsessive compulsive world of a madman in a genuinely loving gay relationship." So I guess you guys already have an idea as to why I want to use "My Silver" or "An Empty You" for the film. Pasok din yung "Broken to Pieces."  Miss you all! Can't wait for tomorrow. You won't believe what hell I got myself into lately. Tsk tsk.  Tah!

      Ayoko na ng paella. Hindi ko kaya...  Excited na akong makita kayo bukas sa Buzz Night.  It's a pity you guys won't be able to record for that short film.  I was thinking the same thing Ralph was since work hours lang pwede, but then I remembered that I won't really be necessary since instrumentals lang ang kailangan.  Sayang.  You could have done something different, for a change.  Sana ok na ako by tomorrow.  This entry should be entitled Sick! (Part 2).

      Oi, a friend is asking if we're interested in writing for the score soundtrack for a short film. May theme daw or something. The film is around 12 minutes. Maybe we can come up with some shoegaze-y sound for that.   There's no problem daw with money for the recording. Recording is any working day during office hours.  To view the film, we still have to go to PIA (Philippine Information Agency) located at Mindanao Avenue. Hindi pa raw kasi na transfer sa VHS so unfortunately we still need to view it there.   I told her na baka puede na yung songs natin. But she thinks na baka sobra naman kasi it's just a short film. Hey, maybe we can use the adlib parts from "My Silver" or "An Empty You"!!   Ewan bahala na. So trip niyo ba?

      I find it a bit weird to post long messages at our small tagboard so I'll just type my replies to the tagboard msgs here at the main blog...   To MARC PAUL ---G-Spot is a bar that's open for bands during Friday nights--I think I got that right.. But I'm a bit confused about your post. Was it your intention to promote a gig at G-Spot (but forgot to mention the gig itself) that's why you posted about the place-- not only once, not only twice,but thrice!  (TV infomercial voice)   Or...did you post it in order to let the readers of this blog (including us) know that we are all free to contact the place anytime if ever we have plans of scheduling an event that we organized to be held at G-Spot (or kung makapal talaga mukha na namin at desperado na sobra puede kami mag sked ng mismong sariling tugtog namin para lang magka gig)  Pardon my being too inquisitive (ganyan kasi ako tuwing hindi ako nakaka uwi ng bahay ng matagal). I just thought that it would be good for both G-Spot and the readers of this blog (including us) if you can clarify that. Who knows, baka may nagbabasa nito na may balak mag put up ng event jan.   To everyone else who need to post something that's non-Candy but is music scene related related anyway, feel free to post them at our tagboard (minsan kasi walang nadadagdag na posts) or better yet, post a message at our mailing list (lalo na ngayon walang bagong pinag-uusapan sa ML namin).  (Us, members of Candyaudioline are really helpful to others. But if you caught us at a bad time (which is most of the time) and we don't feel like being helpful, we pretend.)   To NO. 1 FAN -- Before I proceed to my reply to your flattering posts, in behalf of Candyaudioline, we want you to know that we really, really love the ID that you're using on the tagboard. It makes us feel so admired and no longer ignored and invisible to the local music scene. We surely are hoping that people from our mailing list or the tagboard could come up with nicks that are similar to your nick. (Sagarin ko na ha) You know we don't even mind if "all" of our listeners would all use "NO. 1 FAN" as ID whenever they write to us. Really, we won't mind. So if you're really lazy to come up with an original ID, feel free to use "NO. 1 Fan." It's okay :)  Bullshite aside... with the albums...  we actually have three albums to boast . However, two of these were never released so one can actually claim that they never really existed and that technically, we only had one album for the past years. But we like it better, if we consider the two unreleased albums as something "existent." We think that telling people that " we have three albums " actually sounds a lot better (not to mention that it makes us feel better about our band too) than just being contented in telling the truth flat-out, " we only have one album ." This gives us a feeling of accomplishment and that makes us happy. And we're one band that is in dire need of anything that would put a smile on our faces (so at least we can stop looking like a bunch of problematic individuals that we really are and hopefully gain a few more fans out of our friendly aura).  (Also for people who might be interested, aside from NO. 1 Fan) * Candyaudioline albums  (both real and imaginary):   Paint Your Silver Smile  (released mid-2000)-- it's an 8-song album that was available only in cassettes. Copies were dropped at Mayric's or sold during gigs. It got sold out. Unfortunately, the band was not able to produce enough money for the production of another batch of copies of this album. But if you have the guts to befriend Allan, you can ask for a burned/recorded copy of the 8 songs that caught the attention of the indie fanatics in Metro Manila (nabasa ko lang to ha), he'll be more than happy to provide you with a burned copy. If you don't feel like kissing Allan's arse, the mp3's of some of these songs from  PYSS  might still be available for downloading at the Pinoycentral.com (music page) website. Might. I'm not really sure if the songs are still there but you can always check.   Alone Again at Last   LP (recorded late 2001) this was supposed to be a 9-song LP that includes some of our most kick-ass songs (according to us), but it was never released in the end. We really hated the vocals that was added during the last days of recording sessions at Pink Noise. There were other reasons too for not releasing it,  but this is the only one that I can remember.   An Empty You  EP (recorded late 2002) this is a 4-track EP that gave us a really hard time in deciding on what to do with it:  to release this EP or nevermind this piece of shite ?. In the end, this was just a few weeks ago, we settled on the final decision, which is to cancel it's release (supposedly for this year). That's because we're not satisfied with the final mix and we thought that it sounded really crappy when it was played on NU about a month ago. We felt really bad about it whenever we remember how much money and time and effort were spent on the recording. But we later on figured, that our tough decision is for the better. Besides, how on Earth can we boast about it if we release it even if the fact that it can sound better will only continue to haunt our minds? See, we only boast about things that are boast-able (?). We don't want to take the risk of being laughed at because we're boasting about something mediocre or just plain crappy. If it's supposed release date still pushed through, this could only be a source of something to regret and rant about for the rest of our lives... something that we'll try to justify and explain to others in hope of redeeming ourselves by desperately trying to convince everyone that, "we're not supposed to release it because we also think that it is crappy but ended up releasing it anyway because *insert some excuse*"  Who wants to be bothered by  something like that?  --Some of the songs from all three albums can be searched and downloaded from  Soulseek . If you don't know what  Soulseek  is, it's like ' MIRC  for music lovers.' Here, one can browse other chatters' files and download a file (like mp3) that you like and have it copied to your own computer. Yeah, kinda like a " Napster  and  MIRC  in one thing." You can download  Soulseek  from the net.  Once you're connected to  Soulseek , you can start searching for Candysongs. I suggest that you log on to the #tweefolks  channel (or some other pinoy indiepop channel) because most of the people, who have Candyaudioline mp3's in their shared files, park in this channel (including Allan himself).   An alternative access to free candy songs : If you're at our gigs, you can approach us anytime. You can ask for a burned copy of any of our albums/songs from Allan. He'll be more than happy to provide you a copy. If other members have burners/recorders, they can do that too if they're not feeling too lazy. But that's actually a rare thing to happen. We all have this unspoken rule among us that everything that requires us to move (but is not pertaining to our set) and is related to Candy--should be passed on to Allan.  Sha na bahala .  Thanks for liking our set at the  EMERGENCY gig  at the  UP Bahay ng Alumni . We also think that it was a good set.  We are all hoping that we get invited again for a UP gig. We surely enjoyed playing at the  UP Fair  and at the  UP FA Week   gig, this is also because some of us are students/graduate in UP Diliman. It never fails to amuse us whenever our profs/classmates (who have no idea that we're in a band) would catch our sets and recognize us.  We also like pretending that we're "rakstars" and sometimes try to convince some  people that we really are. This works well whenever we bump into a clueless high school looking kid who is drunk enough to tell us that recognized us from a band that had played.   ---We've played in 70's Bistro and I don't know when we're playing there again. Usually, whenever we have gigs there,it's only just for a front-act stint for another more famous band. Whenever I think of 70's Bistro I see images of us, attempting to ride on the popularity of the band that we're fronting for.

      There already was an album released before: Paint Your Silver Smile with Cheng as the vocalist.  That was years ago.  I'm not sure if Allan still has actual copies with him.  The current lineup of candyaudioline doesn't have a release yet though we've recorded songs.  We probably won't have anything up anytime soon.  What you can do is go on Soulseek and look for our songs there-- discography is on our website.  If you can't do that, just approach us at our gigs,  befriend  us (hehe), and wejust might burn you copies of our recordings :)  Thanks for inquiring, no. 1 fan :)

      Nakakatawa. Allan called last night and we had a short chat.  Akala niya siya yung pinapatamaan ko sa isang part dun sa last entry… it wasn’t that part, it was another one, heehee!  Hindi kasi nagbabasa ng maigi eh… ;P  He told me about his talk with Ayn the other day.  Allan: Tugtog tayo mamaya para sa Cheese at Kamikazee. Ayn: Fuck you. Go Away. Leave me alone. Allan: Ano na naman problema mo? (di ko na maalala kung ano yung sinabi ni Ayn to that at kung ano yung sinabi ni Allan in return) Ayn: Anong itsura ba namin ni Selena? Sige na…  Hahaha! If you weren’t at the last In BeTWEEn Days, you won’t get that.  That wouldn’t be much of a loss, anyway.  Anyway, we hung up after a few minutes because I still had to catch some sleep.  Had WORK the next day, you know… ;P (haha! Exagg sa excitement sa work! Bago pa eh…)  Allan and Roel are sick!!! Grabe, 3 out of 5 members!  Roel is in the hospital.  Wish we could visit him, but he’ll probably be out by the time we can.  Hope it’s not dengue.  No schedule for candyaudioline as of yet, but we’ll probably be playing at Buzz Nite on the 27th.  That is, if the date I’ve given for Buzz Nite is correct and if none of our members are indisposed at the time.  Oh yeah, and there’s that Fox Square Gig.  Be there!

      Last night at Millennia was mostly forgettable.  Or, at least, I’d like to forget it.  Sure-- we arrived there way before the official starting time of the program, planning to squeeze in some free practice, but everything after that started falling apart…   Tips for Pissing Off Your Bandmates:   1.  Arrive late  – Allan had texted us earlier to arrive at 9 pm and we all agreed to do so.  However, due to the rain, the rest of us were delayed by 45 minutes while Allan and Roel languished in the dark mouth of Millennia.  2.  Glory in the caprice of Mother Nature… ONSTAGE  – As soon as we were all set up to play, a torrential rain started outside.  We were able to pull off a few songs fairly and were about to start on the real performance, when Ralph suddenly felt moisture down his back.  The roof was leaking straight onto the extension cord for his amp.  Fate decreed that Ralph would live to eat another Lechon Kawali Combo #3 at Partners Pares… we stopped and waited for the technicians to fix the leak and make the stage safe for us again.  3.  Bitch about the sound system  – Detractors of the band surely love it when we play at this bar.  Times like these, I’m better off being part of the audience.  4.  Imbibe alcohol in the presence of nonbandmates  – Yes. It works especially well when the bar has run out of the very trendy San Mig Light and you’re forced to order a bucket of pale pilsen.  Continually converse with your chosen nonbandmate throughout the night and make sure your facial expressions are exaggerated enough to make you seem extremely interested in the discussion.  The drunker you are, the better.  5.  Tell everyone you have a crush on your bandmate  – Make sure your girlfriend has left the venue early, preferably because you have fought.  Then tell everyone about it.  Then tell everyone you have a crush on your (unfortunate) bandmate.  6.  Kiss a bandmate of the same sex in front of bandmates of the opposite sex  – This will be extremely easy.  Even if you are just innocently passing candy from your lips to your bandmate’s lips, it will look really raunchy and/or disgusting.  Your other bandmates will either be turned on, envious, or just plain shocked out of their minds.  7.  If you are female, act like the drunken bitch you are  – This will incense them thoroughly and cause them to question their own supposedly rigid ideas of your upright nature.  In spite of how grave these misdemeanors may sound, they’re nothing a sincerely concerned phone call can’t fix.  Arm yourself with lots of tissue paper.  My comment on the performance itself:  Initially, I thought we didn’t play very well, but several people told Allan that we performed a good set.  Of course, Sonnet LVIII stole the show last night, but that was to be expected and never begrudged :)  Thank you to all the other bands who played: Soft Pillow Kisses, Spring Boutique and Balloon Derby (sila nga ba yun? Sorry, di ko alam kasi…). It was a pity that Popular Days had shadows cast on its own soul that night and couldn’t play…  I must say that I  sincerely and truly  love my bandmates in candyaudioline.

      I accompanied Ayn yesterday to her graduation pictorial and waited 5 hours before she finished.  You can only write about so much in your journal in 5 hours, even when there are half-naked women running to and fro in the halls.  At least, we got the recipe for Deviled Hotdogs from the lobby café.  I decided to crash at Ayn’s place afterwards so we could go to Mayric’s together to meet Allan and Ralph.  She let me watch her DVD of “24-Hour Party People” while waiting.  It was fantastic!  It was one of the coolest and most honest films I’ve watched in my life.  I just love English humor.  After kissing Tristania goodbye and thoroughly annoying her in the process, we proceeded to Mayric’s.  We got there almost an hour before Allan arrived.  It was a good thing Oscar let us in to wait.  I read Roel’s article in PULP (enjoyed it) and drooled over the Radiohead article. *Sigh*. Jepoy and his bandmate passed by and kept us company while Ayn finished her beer.  Finally, Allan and Ralph arrived, so we headed on to Gypsy, Malate to front for Kamikazee.  We only had to wait around 20 minutes before we had to perform.  We were a bit nervous because we hadn’t seriously practiced or performed in a long time.  I was comforted by the fact that the mic sounded loud, so I didn’t have to strain myself to be heard. We were into the first verse of “Better View” when, to my horror, I realized that I hadn’t taken off my retainers! Ack!  I spluttered my way through the song.  Some people from the front decided to move downstairs. Haha.  When we finished, I went through the sponsors, introduced the next song, then turned around and stuffed my retainers into my left pocket.  Ew.  Ralph was, “What the hell--??” and laughed.  I think nobody saw me do it, heehee.  So we launched into “Nothing Much to Lose”, which everyone loved.  Then, my second booboo of the night: I interchanged the lyrics of the second and third verses.  Thankfully, Allan wasn’t singing along anymore, so I just concentrated on making a clean exchange of the lyrics so that no one would notice. Whew.  The last two songs were different, though. Allan asked Lara to video them, and that was fortunate because we… ahem… totally rocked. Hehehe.  The fun part about it was that the stage was open air, so a lot of other restaurants could hear us play.  I’m sure we sounded intriguing.  A lot of friends told us afterwards that it was a good set. Of course, Allan talked to me later on and said that we should practice together because we vocalists were starting to sound out of sync (and that popped my balloon). Sigh.  So Ayn and I went downstairs to finish our complementary beers.  Roel was talking to us… I felt a little overwhelmed by Red Horse so I jokingly said to him, “Wala bang maitutulak?”  “Pulutan? Bili ka!”  “Nge, wala akong pera…”  “Ako magbabayad,” and he promptly called the waiter, made him take our order, and gave me the money to pay for it.  That was pretty generous of him.  He made this excuse about having a judging racket somewhere that paid him a thousand pesos.  It was still very nice of him :)  And then our sisig arrived and Jay, who was sitting with Concrete Sam at the next table, shouted, “Ayan na ang mga sisig ghirrrlsssssssssss!”, which was followed by howls of laughter.  Ayn and I were embarrassed at the attention, but Jay is so funny and unpredictable that we couldn’t help laughing ourselves.  Ayn just offered them some of our sisig.  I went outside to talk to Allan.  I was a bit tipsy so I told Allan that his whole shirt was wet with sweat except for his nipple area.  Then I sat down next to him and watched the people pass by.  Ayn came out after a few minutes and scolded me for leaving her.  Apparently, some chick in whit sat down at my seat and told her, “You’re so prettyyyyyy…” and she was freaked out.  So we decided to leave with Ralph.  Allan was a bit disappointed that we were leaving already, especially since the Manyak boys had just arrived, but I was tired and Ralph was, too, and Ayn had to meet a kumare of ours at Xaymaca.  At Xaymaca, Ayn wanted to stay with her friend and she graciously offered for Mike to drive me and Ralph home.  Thank god that something’s happening to candy again…  Tonight is In BeTWEEn Days at Millennia Bar.  Be sure to be early because candyaudioline is playing early.  Working and studying members, you know…

Wala masyadong nangyayari sa banda ngayon kasi busy lahat.  I think we’re still looking forward to being together on the 14th.  Remember, In BeTWEEn Days at Millennia, Kamuning.  Sana makapunta kayo. Wala na rin kasi kaming EP anytime soon eh. Boohoohoo.

      I talked to Allan last night. It's official... di na namin ipapalabas ang EP dahil hindi ok sa standards namin.  It's sad, but we hope all of you who have been waiting for it will understand.  Anyway, kung di niyo na talaga kaya, there are still some versions on the net available :)  Anyway, don't worry.  This is all for the better...

      How do I do that, Ayn? I’m afraid hehe…  I dreamt about Ralph last night.  Actually, kasama yung buong banda pero si Ralph lang yung naaalala ko.  He was pretty bitchy in my dream, if you know what I mean. Weird!  Don’t worry, Ralph, walang romantic chuvang nangyari satin hehehe.

      Selena cut and paste mo lang yung zonkboard sa site ng blog.  BTW, thanks to albertaspaghetti at since nagparamdam siya sa mailing list natin, dumami ang members. As of now, there are already 40 members in our mailing list. Since dumating si alberta, na move from around 29 members to 40 members (including alberta of course). Ang bilis no. The last one who joined is cheatingchair. Funny though because cheating chair's e-mail was just created a day (or hours) before joining our mailing list.  Ang daming ganun sa mailing list. Siguro around 3 or 4 ang ganun. Tapos hindi sila nagsasalita. Marami tayong mga stalker.

      send mo na lang saken yung email containing the details on how to integrate it to the site. baka kasi magkamali din ako.  btw, di ako sa parokya nagroadie. nag-swap kami ni roel. cya sa parokya, ako sa moonstar. and they performed sa sm fairview. :D  maybe we weren't just in the mood to work on a new song last night. i think mas atat tayo (sans allan) na magpractice ng old songs. oh well. as for the song, yes, di ko pa masyado nakikita ang direction ng kanta... what without the lyrics. and i still am undecided on what to put in the songs. cguro nga it just needs time to grow.   inaantok akooooooooooo... monday blues.

      haha. I do not know how to put the zonkboard in even if I've signed up for one. i'm totally stupid when it comes to stuff like that. i could copy and paste the html code i guess but i'm afraid i might fuck up the blog. so you'll just have to wait in silence for a while... at least, until ralph can enlighten me... oh, raaalphyyy...  we did end up practicing last night! ralph and charmaine were with Allan during the afternoon because he was roadieing for Parokya at Ever Commonwealth.  Allan brought them to Ayn's house to visit Tristania while he practiced with Pillow. Nakakainggit!!!  So they texted last night and picked me up and we all went to the studio.  Allan was practicing his two Pillow vocalists and it looked like he was really working hard on them.  Medyo nainip kami ng konti after a while because Roel hadn't showed up yet and it was getting late.  The three of us decided to start practicing just to make good use of our time.  We played the soft songs, acoustic... my voice was a little scratchy (probably from all the recent drinking binges) but I was able to get it used to singing again.  It was nice to go ahead without Allan because it just shows how we can also work independently of him when he can't make it.  Roel then arrived and then I called Allan... we soon had a full setup.  I thought we were going to practice the old songs and perhaps rework them, as Allan had originally planned, but he gave Ayn this bass line to do.  She did it-- and then they started on the new song! Cool. Allan told me he hadn't thought up a melody yet and was hinting that I could contribute if I want to, but that prospect scared me so much.  Still, I tried thinking of possible melodies and I had just begun humming  something when he hummed something into the mic.  It sounded different from the melody I was thinking, so all the strains vanished from my head and I immediately realized that the most I can contribute for this song are some lyrics.  Allan will be alarmed at this statement.  Nope... I really wasn't ready to give any melody, and I think he just saved me from embarrassing myself haha. Seriously... I'm not ready. I think I will be someday, just not for this song. Hindi ko pa makuha kasi yung intuition that comes with being in a band when it comes to musical direction. Saka na.  It's a good song. I think it has great potential... we only finished 3/4 of it and none of the melody yet.  Ralph can't see where it's going yet but that's ok. It still needs a ton of work. I'm glad we're becoming productive again.  well, hope we all can catch (as a band) the cine europa movies that lara sent through the egroups.

      Masaya nga ang may conference call, pero nakakalito rin!  I hope that candyaudioline will be able to practice early tonight.  I miss my bandmates again.  The other night, Allan played with Pillow at Megastrip, and someone approached them.  “What happened to candyaudioline??? Ba’t ang lambot niyo na??” Allan had to explain that it was Pillow.  So, you see, maybe people are looking for us already. Heehee.  Totoo yung tinext ni Ayn nun hehehe. Pero shame on you manyak boys for being affected by that news!!!  Her heartburn was causing her considerable discomfort that night…  Laba tayo sa bahay ni Ralph!!!

      Bardo says, “Bad trip kasi si Selena,” because I didn’t make Ayn bring Tristania in when she brought me home.  This morning, Allan called at an unusually early time (11 am).  He deliberately pointed out the fact that I forgot to mention Ayn’s behavior at Nymphet’z in yesterday’s post.  Well, we kept on giving her the microphone the other night, but Ayn kept saying she wasn’t drunk yet.  So we had given up already after a few songs.  Then, Antz started singing “Don’t Dream It’s Over”, with the others botching it up now here and there.  Ayn suddenly grabbed the mic and finished the last verse and two choruses. Wow! We were all surprised.  Ayn has a good voice, you know.  It was funny though, because before that she had never let on about her singing abilities.  Nakakainis nga si Allan kasi sinabihan ba naman niya ako this morning, “So you can sing, huh?”  Anyway, that’s all. I spent some time with Ayn and Tristania this afternoon after a friendly chat with her and Mia at Gayuma.  Friends na kami ni Tristia! Belat.

      Hello.  I have long been absent, but I’m here now.  That quote from your last entry, Ayn… I say, “Hear! Hear!”  So, Allan has written a new song for SPK. I like the lyrics, especially the twist at the end. Damn. Love sucks.  Bardo, my 14-year-old brother says hi. Nagbobonding kami ngayon. Sabi niya wala daw silang pasok ngayon kasi bobo yung teacher nila.  He wants all of you to know that.  I’m sure it will be of some use to you someday.  Anyway, I think Allan was able to vent out his feelings while we were drawing on the paper table mat in Burgoo, Rockwell last Sunday.  We watched “View From the Top”, which was totally disappointing, and looked around for shoes for him.  We were supposed to be with other candymates but they were all tired. At least, with less people, it was easier for him to get the ranting out of the way so he could… ahem… channel his passion more creatively. Tada! New song… (sana nga lang para sa candy!)  Last night, we planned to get on with our candy movie, but SM North didn’t have new movies to show.  So Allan, Ayn and I decided to drink our woes away at Quattro and meet up with the Manyaks there.  We all ordered macho mugs of course and our favorite chicharon bulaklak… the cheese puffs were good, too.  I was drunk by the time Antz of Spring Boutique arrived… I had finished half of my mug and my head was splitting in too.  When Charles joined us, I was begging Allan to let me go home, until---------------- Darius texted Allan: “Tara!”  Instantly, my headache went away.  In a few minutes, we were off to Nymphet’z.  We were ushered into the KTV by this tall lady. Of course, as expected, there was red lighting and skimpily clad women.  But I was surprised at how classy the place actually looked. It wasn’t just any KTV (I mean, you know, knowing the Manyaks and Allan, I had certain ideas of places they would probably patronize).  I thought, “If this is classy, what would Pegasus look like inside?”  Anyway, the staff was very gracious towards us.  The DJ kept greeting us, saying the guys’ names as if they were old friends.  He kept saying, “Good evening, Charles… nasan na si John Faul?” and, “Good evening to Allan and the two lovely ladies with him.” Haha. Blush, blush. *snicker*  But you know, I’m always a sucker for personalized service.  So we videoke’d the night away.  Charles and Antz had originally brought two ladies to sit with them, but they left after a while. Aw.  I could see that there was an especial droop to Charles’ bangs after that. I guess we were cramping their style, although they generously denied that fact.  They were more pissed that Darius’ friend had retained Charles’ special “friend” for the night.  Oh well… they got back at him with retorts through the mic during the spaces between songs on the videoke. Heee heee heee.  We left at around 3 am.  We had Allan to thank for shouldering the brunt of the expenses.  He bought me an internet card so I could post on the blog.  Hmm, this entry looks a bit short after such an interesting event.  Truth is, I don’t want to seem too eager-beaver about this Nymphet’z thing because I AM a girl… and also, nothing much happened, mainly because the guys didn’t have money.  I’m just happy that I’m online again and that I can now do immediate updates for the candyblog when necessary.  In BeTWEEn Days is on Sept. 14 at Millenia, Kamuning. Listen to the lovely sounds of Spring Boutique, Popular Days, Soft Pillow Kisses, Candyaudioline, and two more bands (don’t know who).  Oh, I have an interesting note.  This morning, my Mom came out of the bathroom singing, “Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!” ala Parokya ni Edgar.  It wasn’t quite the same, maybe a more dignified version, but it shows how “Mr. Suave” is an institution in Philippine pop culture. Egad.

      Thanks everyone for gracing my party last Tuesday night. I'm so glad that everybody had fun----and got dead drunk:  Selena and Allan of Candyaudioline, Lara of SPK, Antz and Jefkid of Spring Boutique, the manyak boys plus Erick of Popular Days, Mia, Joey, Aisha, Annejo, Charms of Matilda, Chris, Jihad (Moomtaz), Oneil, Mario, Aldem, Roel (Five Wounds to Enter)...etc...  It wouldn't be the same if you guys weren't there. *sniff sniff*  Thanks also to Paul of Klub 102 for the tequila and for being so accommodating with the guests. He he. I'm really sorry about the mess. We'll be back there real soon!  We kick arse.  I love you all.  *wave wave*

      Last Tuesday, as you all know, was Ayn’s birthday, which she held at Klub 102.  We arrived there before Allan and Jeff, but the owner recognized us anyway and he asked who the celebrant was.  We all pointed at Ayn and the man came out with this bottle of Cuervo Gold, saying it was a present from them.  Ayn was so touched, and we immediately set ourselves up for some shots.  Needless to say, we got very drunk because of those tequila shots, to the point where I did not know what I was doing or saying anymore.  I just knew I was having A LOT of fun.  I didn’t even notice when Ayn’s other guests started trickling into the bar.  The Manyaks were there, of course, and so were Antz and Erick, both of whom had shamelessly cut their indie locks for more clean-cut gelled hair.  I remember telling Antz over and over again that he looked like a BA student hehehe.  I was sitting with them and SPK at the bar having a beer.  While I was talking to John Paul, I vaguely sensed that Lara was up to something.  Imagine my surprise when she sprinkled salt on MY hand, and used it to lick, shoot and suck her tequila shot!  Of course, since I myself was inebriated, I found that really funny and I told her she had to let me do it to her, too.  So she gave me her hand, and right before I did it, she squealed ticklishly.  We really cracked up over our crude attempt at “body shots”.  We forced Charles to let us lick his hand, too, and that meant more tequila—more drunk!  Hmm… it was Ayn’s birthday and you’re reading this, thinking, “When is she gonna start about the celebrant already?”  Sorry, folks, I can’t help you much there.  I really was that weird.  Only tequila can do that to me.  I remember seeing Ayn sort of dazed and smiling serenely, leaning her head on Jihad’s shoulder for support.  I’d say something inane to her and she just kept smiling like that.  Well, she LOOKED like she had been having a happy birthday… :)  My favorite part was the dancing.  We were all soooo drunk.  Allan had arrived and had taken over Jeff’s DJ-ing.  We went upstairs to watch him and we were just really enjoying the good music.  Antz puked in between the giant speakers, I saw him hehehe.  And then, Allan played “June”, which was one of Lara’s favorite songs and she started dancing.  So I got up and joined her.  And we were embracing each other and all dancing like fools!  And then I requested for “Deserve” by Trembling Blue Stars, which Allan played, and the great thing about it was that we ALL started singing the chorus… “But as for YOU, as for YOU… you’re everything that I thought you we-errrrre… and I don’t… DESERVE you….” It was so cool.  We were just really nuts and drunk and enjoying the music and having fun being together.  It was a pity I had to go soon after that because they tell me Charles did this really funny dance.  But it was already 4 am around that time.  I said goodbye to Ayn, kissing her CHASTELY several times on the lips.  She was still smiling serenely at me.  It was a great birthday, Ayn.  Thanks for sharing it with us.

It sickens me. I'd rather stick to clean stuff like candyaudioline does hehehe...  Don't get me wrong. It saddens me, but I think I'll feel better in time. Maybe I can start anew someday.  Sorry, nabawasan tuloy kayo ng internet soap opera fix niyo. Nyehehe.  Wala pa kaming tugtog anytime soon, except for the Matilda EP launch. Sana tumugtog na kami, for real.  Lastly, I would just like to say that I am not a liar, just a real person who has her weaknesses and faulty reasoning. Thank you. Bow.  I didn't want to spoil the party, so I went...

      Buzz Night was great! I can only give highlights for now because I'm still hurting from the late night, and the following are my own choices:  * At the Moonstar gig at Claret, the crowd responded so well. * Weedisneys played "Where Is My Mind" (complete with violinist na sabi nina Allan and Charles ang kyut kyut) and "Paranoid Android"!!!! (Hi, thom ;*)  And their volume was really great. * Met a guy from INK who had read my personal blog and who likes candyaudioline.  Very friendly :) * Popular Days is still alive!!!  They played a great acoustic set last night.  Napa-awwwwwwwww nga kami kasi napaka-moving talaga ng intro ng "December Song" hehehe.  And of course, bati na kasi si Eric at si Charles (Yiheeeeee! Kiss!). * Nag-bonding pa kami nina Kaye... * Tinupad ni Jeff yung pangako niya at pinansin niya ako hahaha! * Kita namin si Ralph, although briefly... and he actually suggested practicing tonight.  "Ralph, ikaw ba yan???" Hehe. * Picture taking galore with people's phones...  Ang saya.  Sana nga lang tumugtog yung candyaudioline kagabi. Pero ok lang. Sana na lang magka gig uli para makasama rin namin sina Ayn at Roel.

      last night we played at 70's bistro... it could be considered as one of our best gigs for the past few weeks although there's a weird feeling that comes with it because VOLUME was never a factor last night...  yes, it wasn't that LOUD!!! ARE WE GROWING OLD... HEHEHE... i just wish that some day... fate would smile at CANDYAUDIOLINE and give us venues that would really allow us (and others like us) to play in the manner that we realy like...

      We practiced, we practiced, we practiced! Yay!  They let me hold a guitar again (thanks, Acel! ;)  So we had four guitars last night and a bit more noise.  I was only doing clean tones but I guess the noise part came from my flubbed chords, teehee.  But it was so much fun.  Allan taught me his super special secret chords (hehe, exagg, pare) and we did a crash course on candy rhythm guitar.  Ralph said it added another dimension to our playing.  Ayn said I was strumming on the fret area too much.  Roel didn't say anything.  Allan said I should practice.  And I will, I promise, except that I hope someone lends me a guitar so I can get used to the weight and the level of it relative to my arms and other stuff like that.  Damn, it was fun.  They went out for a yosi break and I stayed inside to play some stuff from Radiohead (hi, thom ;* hehe).  Nag-drums pa nga si Ralph sa "Black Star".  I started doing my crude version of "Just" and they all came in again and started jamming with me.  It sounded pretty authentic, the way everyone was doing it, and we didn't even have a tab at hand or anything.  I'll probably get one on the net just to get chords so (hopefully) we can play it someday.  I love that song just because it's so  loud and ear-splitting .  After candy, pillow practiced for a while.  John Paul was feeling under the weather, so they cut it short.  We then decided to go to Pares because we were so hungry.  Allan and Ralph started talking about our next recording sessions and maybe making it a full album instead of an EP.  They were throwing back and forth ideas on money matters and logistics and it was very exciting because this just may be the real thing.  Let's all cross our fingers for that.  Then, Ayn brought us all home.  Thanks, Ayn!  Tonight, we'll be at 70's Bistro to front for Parokya ni Edgar.  Yehey.  Tugtog na naman.

      By chance, nakausap ko si Allan about his Pisay Backbeat gig and he had something very interesting to say.  Seven people actually approached him asking for candyaudioline cds. Woah.  That’s a lot, for a school that has such a small population.  And MY school at that! I was so amazed that they actually knew we existed, Pisay usually being an insular kind of place (but only because of its strict curfews).  Ralph is from Pisay, too, although he hails from the Mindanao campus.  Allan had wondered how they got to listen to our stuff.  Some of them told him that they knew someone from Valenzuela who had copies of our songs, but for some reason, he was having difficulty sharing them with others.  They wanted their own copies.  Allan told them he didn’t have any at the time, but that they could come to Buzz Night (Mayric’s on the 25th!), and maybe he could give them some there.  They regretfully replied that the school never let them out that late at night (they must be dormers). Well, we’ll see if we can find a way to make the songs more available online, somehow.  I used to be a dormer, as well.  Why don’t they just get a group together that can sleep over at an extern’s house Saturday night, so they can pass by Buzz Night. My friends and I use to do that all the time in high school.  Weekends, the school can’t really exercise as much control because dormers are allowed to “go home”.  At least, that was how I remembered it.  I hope the school doesn’t have a chokehold on you guys there.  I just want to say that I’m proud that the students of Pisay these days are intelligent enough to listen to good music.  When I heard about these students, I almost wanted to sing, “Thy light our beacon beeeeeee… In our path through the world, in our fight for the right, in pursuit of a glorious theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee…” hehehe. Pero Tagalog na yata yung mga kinakanta niyo ngayon.  Anyway, look through the old yearbooks in the library and you’ll know what I’m talking about hehhehe.  For the record, I’d just like to confess that I’ve always had a crush on Sir EJ Baranda, my Research teacher in high school.  I actually had a plan of approaching him after graduation ceremony and presenting him with an apple and a bag of our Honorably Mentioned anti-alcohol craving Kudzu candy.  I wanted to erase from his mind the memory of our cannibalistic lab mice (*shudder*) and let bygones be bygones.  Of course, I never gathered the guts to do all this so I just beamed at him from under my cap and toga and said “Goodbye”.  (Hi, Sir EJ! ;*)

      The last entry was in reaction to Allan's ghost post that was inadvertently deleted by yours truly.  Don't worry, he says he'll post it again for all of you, though I can't guarantee its palatability... might be too acidic for some people, or perhaps he'll neutralize it a bit. I wouldn't know... that's totally up to him.  It concerned his thoughts about the music scene and attitudes of people in it.  He wanted to leave them all behind.  Ayn and I thought that he meant even us at candyaudioline, but he assured us that that was never going to happen and that we  were   the noah's ark. Haha. Yehey. Paranoid androids (hi, thom yorke! ;*)  Incidentally, that character is from that series of novels "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy".  Ayn, Allan and I were together last night.  There was a Kamikazee gig at Millennia and Roel was there, too, but we opted to hang out somewhere else for a while where some of our friends were having drinks.  We saw Ramon Zialcita, who greeted Allan, and Ayn was swooning.  She really was.  He looks really good when he's sober.  We went to Millennia then and saw all our friendster pals from Kamikazee hehehe.  Hindi pa nga ako ina-add nina Jomal eh. Boo.  Well, they promised us they would very soon.  So Charles, Mia, Michelle, Allan, Ayn and I decided to get some grub and we went, for a change, to this Bulaluhan Charles knew.  Most of us had Bulalo, which was yummy in the early cold of the morning, and some had liempo.  As usual, Charles and Allan were bantering and cracking us all up in the process.  Charles told us the story of that restaurant, how one woman stayed in the bathroom for an hour and then she left and the toilet was clogged-- then the proprietors found a dead fetus in it.  Bulalo. Yum.

      Go figure about the title.  It’s not connected to the main topic I wish to discuss in this entry.  It’s connected to a personal problem I’m currently having that I mentioned to Allan and Charles and John Paul last night and they’ve been trying to figure it out.  Let this serve as a clue and an assurance that, despite it being “an exercise in futility”, I have found some comfort in those words above and that I have accepted the circumstances surrounding my problem.  You can all rest easy, now :)  So we played last night at Millennia.  There were only three bands that night: us, soft pillow kisses and superminty.  Only a few friends passed by; Ralph commented that it was “An Empty House Part 2”, but we don’t really mind when that happens.  It’s actually more fun sometimes when it’s just us :)   I fooled around with Allan’s guitar during the soundcheck and that gave him the idea of letting me play it for a few songs. I was excited but iffy about it.  I didn’t know how to use an electric guitar nor the gadget.  He let me play “Don’t Go Away”, “Flaming Walls” and “An Empty You”.  I kept flubbing the chords because I was too excited haha and I couldn’t time pressing my foot on the pedal—I think I almost broke Allan’s effects hehehe.  Anyway, despite the mishaps, it was extremely fun to play the guitar on stage.  Roel told me afterwards that everyone was amused at that impromptu performance.  The guys might even teach me to play the electric guitar and maybe I can sub for Allan when he can’t make it to gigs.  I also sang for Pillow because Louie couldn’t make it that night.  We played well.  Superminty did, too.  We were all raring to repeat the Klub 102 experience so we went there at around 1 am to drink.  We had a few friends tagging along.  It was really fun.  Indie Jeff and I had a talk for the first time.  He sees through my words.  I think everyone does, but he was the first one to tell me so.  He said that the way I’m so honest about everything I feel in this blog shows my insecurities.  He encouraged me not to feel so vulnerable to what people say or think.  Sabi niya, wag daw akong mahiya sa ibang tao sa scene, kasi “scene NATIN ‘to!”  He said, “Sa genre natin, tulungan tayo.”  I clarified that I was never envious of how other bands in the scene are able to draw crowds more than candy can, though; I’m actually really happy that they can because their appeal helps keep the genre alive.  I don’t begrudge them that… but I did admit that I  am  insecure, although I had  always  been like that even before being part of the indie scene.  Actually, I understand what he was trying to say: hang-ups are never really necessary and we don’t have to show everything.  Isn’t indie also being brief and understated sometimes? He was just concerned that I was so skittish about things at Buzz Night; he assured me that I don’t have to worry too much.  I appreciated his encouragement.  I thanked him and even hugged him about 5 times, though part of that was probably because of the alcohol in my brain hehehe.  I told Allan about my talk with Jefkid and  he  said this whole genre and the people in it were also created because of their insecurities, so I shouldn’t be too worried.  That made sense, too.  It reminded me of my first response to albertaspaghetti’s first query on indie.  And I also remember what Allan said that defending the genre also contributes to its longevity.  So there’s always that question again: how are you supposed to manifest INDIE?  I think it’s more personal.  What does the music mean for you?  All of us in the scene love the same music.  We should all enjoy it as much as we can and in any and every way we like.  Personally, being insecure is a large part of my personality, and though it’s not a very attractive trait, it still manifests in the things I say, do or, in this case, write.  But I’ll try not to be too anal anymore.  Thanks, jeff :)

      Minor correction: Joseph is not a goth boi, he's a chameleon. And that's a compliment mind you. People who know him will agree with me. He's been around since time immemorial and has played an active part in new wave, goth, hardcore, punk, ska, etc events.   During gigs, one can actually play a "where's Joseph?" game. Parang "Where's Waldo" yan si Joseph eh. Hehe. Dalawa lang ang puedeng get-up ni Joseph: (1) pag hardcore gig, hardcore talaga or pag indie gig, indie talaga, or (2) he'll wear something that would make him stand out like the worst sore thumb one has ever seen (yung nag bathing suit sha sa hardcore gig at yung nag statue of liberty at nag raggedy anne sha sa goth gigs).  First time ko sha nakita sporting his Bauhaus shirt nung isang goth gig sa Music Museum nung early 2001. Nung nagpunta lahat ng tao sa Big Sky after the gig, sa kanya ko pinanakaw yung picture ng Colour Contest na nakadikit sa wall (Documento). Oops, so alam na nila Ernest ngayon kung sino kumuha ng nawawalang picture nun.  He likes Candyaudioline at sayang wala pa si Selena nung minsan nasa Buzz nite sha at sumasayaw sa harap during candy's set. Sabay nung Mindrape na ang tumugtog dun sha bigla pumwesto sa tabi ng mga hatak ng Mindrape.   Goth mode si Joseph nung first time sha makita ni Selena. That was at Club Sex nung tumugtog tayo for Skies of Ember's album launching.  Siempre, you can't expect him to be at Sunday Grabe or other gigs na pang mainstream/radio-friendly bands. He's more of an underground (?) person except maybe pag may gig na kahit NU-related eh for a cause naman like nung Alternativity 2001 where we played. Sabi niya nag donate daw sha ng de lata in exchange for the tickets at sayang naman kung di pa sha manuod. Pag ganitong klaseng gigs, he wouldn't bother to dress up anymore.  If you want to see the Joseph that people have come to love (or otherwise), dun kayo magpunta sa mga new wave, indie, goth, at punk na gigs magpunta. He's one person who can actually tell which event ang worthy na puntahan. And he knows which gig ang talagang indie. (oops, naghukay ng issue na naman.) He he he.  Hindi minamaliit si Joseph. Sha mismo alam niya kung sino ang mga dapat lang niyang kilalanin. Kung hindi ka kilala ni Joseph, sorry ka nalang. Har har har.  I'm waiting for the day na may taong gagawa ng website about him.

      I went to Ayn’s house early last night because Allan, Ayn and I had planned to meet up later to drink and be together and celebrate the advent of one of Ayn’s “visitors”.  Tristia was at home and she looked a lot bigger than she was the last time I saw her.  She had several teeth showing already; I thought she was going to bite me with them when I saw her, but she treated me like an old friend, and I was so honored.  We played with tissue paper and a little plastic basketball.  Ayn took some pictures of us, too.  I can’t believe how fast she’s growing.  She’s a little miracle.  Each time I see her, she looks more and more like her mother.  I was still tired from the night before, but I liked being with my band mates again.  I showed Ayn the videos Allan let me copy and we were laughing a little at some of the selections.  We couldn’t believe Allan had videos of Ministry and Agnostic Front and Killing Joke, but that just goes to show that he’s not as narrow-minded as people think him to be.  Only a little, haha.  Allan texted us that he was already in Manila, having just come from a Lucena trip with Moonstar 88.  We were to meet him at Mang Sam’s where Superminty was practicing.  We arrived there and found only Charles, John Paul and Allan M.  Allan Drummer was apparently at the hospital because of an emergency with his father, so practice was actually cancelled.  We then decided to go to Klub 102 in Makati, probably because Allan had seen it on our way to Intramuros the night before.  Since we were heading to a New Wave place, Ayn played her New Wave Classics cd on the car stereo.  Having bought the same tape in high school, I began singing to some of the songs along the way.  I remembered high school again.  Allan liked the Depeche Mode songs.  Charles laughed at Erasure.  Teehee.  Klub 102 was ok.  That goth guy Joseph was there, the one I remember from my first gig with candy, the guy who let me smell these flowers he was holding.    We drank a lot at Klub 102.  John Paul let me have a few puffs from his cigarette, just for fun.  I got so drunk, but as usual I was just makulit.  We talked about elephant penises and body proportions.  We had a lot of fun.  The music was really good and I could tell Allan was really enjoying it.  He even danced a little!  He’ll probably deny that.  He did, though.  John Paul was dancing.  I was itching to dance, too, but only because I couldn’t resist the music.  New Wave really is an unbelievably timeless genre.  I stayed in my seat, though, thank god.  Ayn was pretty calm… I don’t think she got drunk, but I think she was enjoying too.  Charles kept looking at the couple seated behind us because they were getting it on.  When I went to the bathroom, I noticed a sign on the wall that said the club was offering steamed, hot face towels for 20 pesos each.  I wondered what the hell they were for.  I made John Paul (or was it Charles? I can’t remember!) ask the waiter, and he replied that they were for drunk people to revive themselves with.  I wasn’t too sure about that.  I saw an arrow pointing up the stairs. It wasn’t parallel to the stairs; the angle was such that if you made them both continuous, they would intersect at a point about a foot above the top step.  I obsessed about that.  I kept telling Allan that my early engineering training made that offensive for me.  He argued that the arrow’s function was just to tell people that something was upstairs and that drunks wouldn’t really be able to tell the difference.  Okay.  I can respect a functional analysis anytime.  But for some reason, it bothered me, and I kept bringing it up every 10 minutes or so.  I’m just glad Allan didn’t punch me in the face for being so annoying, hehehe… unlike SOMEONE with us who mock-threatened to do so! Humph.  The ride to our next stop was sort of a blur for me.  I suddenly realized we were at David’s Tea House on Timog.  I remember asking Allan before we left Klub 102 where he was taking us and he said, “David’s.”  “Salon??? Weird…”  I made him take me to the bathroom because I really needed to pee.  After I peed, I felt so dizzy that I had to lean against the wall of the stall.  I couldn’t move for 20 seconds, and I just stared at the ceiling and willed myself not to faint.  I dragged myself out and washed my face.  That made me feel slightly better.  I went outside and Allan guided me upstairs to our table.  We saw Cookie Chua at the next table and she and Allan greeted each other.  Recognizing her, I tried to give her my brightest smile and said, “Hello!”  She smiled nervously and said hi, too.  Then we sat down.  I was feeling really queasy by the time our iced teas arrived, but sipping mine revived me enough to be able to eat and pester Allan about that crooked arrow sign.  He sipped his iced tea and said it was sweet.  I told him, “No, it’s not! It’s just right.  Besides, all you have to do is crush the lemons.”  I then took my straw and started crushing the lemon slices in  his  iced tea, singing “Crush the leh-mons… crush the leh-mons” a la that “Crush the Flowers” song. Weird!!!  I kept telling the guys, “You know what, I said hi to Cookie Chuya.”  They cracked up every time I said that.  I couldn’t get it right because my tongue was stuck to the roof of my mouth.  So we ate, and they were all saying the food was good.  “You know what, Allan; you’ve always been telling us how good the food is here and that we should get to experience the place.  One day, when we drive past this restaurant, I won’t really be able to say that I know what this place is like because I couldn’t taste anything except for the iced tea.  I don’t know, maybe it’s because I’m drunk.”  I took another puff, this time from Ayn’s cig, and then my drunkenness doubled and I thought I was going to pass out on the table.  Fortunately, we all got up to leave just then.  Allan guided me downstairs again.  I told him I was afraid I wouldn’t make it to my front door and I actually suggested to Ayn that she let me sleep at her place.  He said he’d bring me to my door.  And he did, and I didn’t pass out.  They all went home.  I even made it to my own bed, and it felt so good to finally rest.  I woke up this morning feeling shitty.  I was ashamed of some of the things I had said last night, even if I was fully conscious of having said them.  I know how annoyingly makulit I can get when I’m drunk and I was aware that I was that way with them last night.  I apologized to Allan through text, but he told me he really enjoyed our inuman.  And I realized, I did, too—A LOT.  It was great being with Ayn and Allan and the Manyak Boys again.  They’re really some of the best people I know in the world.  I remember having vowed never to drink in front of them again after the previous In BeTWEEn Days, but now I know they really are people in whose company I can be myself, even when unabashedly drunk.

      I met Allan at Glorietta last night where he was supervising a Moonstar 88 gig.  I was kind of desperate to see my bandmates again, and I thought that Ayn had already left for Malate without me.  Allan said he was probably going to a Parokya gig in Malate after all the Moonstar stuff he had to do, so he said we could probably pass by and see Ayn.  Hard Rock Café gives really good band food.  We hitched with Acel and Danny to go to Intramuros, where Moonstar had another stint.  Afterwards, we hitched with Paolo and Mara to Mayric’s so Allan could talk to Kamikazee.  As you can see, it was all about Allan’s business, for the most part.  At around one o’clock, Ayn texted us and told us it wasn’t necessary to pass for her.  Sayang din, but we weren’t sure what time we’d be able to do so anyway.  So, after Allan was finished with all of his duties, he suggested we hang out at his place and look through his video collection.  I was scared of his dog.  But after the initial eager sniffing, he became very placid.  He even put his snout on my leg and looked up at me with doe eyes.  It was so cute.  I couldn’t be afraid of him after that.  He also kept perching on the couch’s headboard, as if he were a cat. Funny.  So Allan showed me all the videos he downloaded.  Some of them were those isolated hits I used to love from high school, alone in my dorm room: “Girl From Mars”, “Sucked Out”, “Your Woman”.  It really brought back memories.  And Allan has quite an impressive collection, at least, for me—someone who never really downloads stuff from the Net.  Anyway, at around 4 am, he treated me to a very early Marlet’s breakfast of fried chicken-silog.  Yum.  But my Royal’s ice had little white flecks in it, so I just opted to drink straight from the bottle, even if it was warm.  Then he brought me home.  Yehey. Sleep.  Seeing Allan and the prospect of seeing Ayn really cheered me up.  The sound trip did, too.  I’ve really needed it these past two days.  I’ve been feeling jittery and nervous.  Kind of schizo.  That’s why I was so afraid to meet Milenyo—I didn’t think I could take a hyperactive canine jumping on me and slobbering on me.  I thought I’d fall to pieces if he did.  I have very good news, though.  In BeTWEEn Days at Millennia will be on Monday and we’re playing.  Please be there.  We really miss playing and we’d love for you to share the experience with us again.  Then again, you can just ignore us.  We don’t mind.  Haha.

      I talked to Allan last night.  He’s afraid that his schedule will be too tight to see us this sembreak because of more and more Parokya gigs coming up. Told him we’d still be here.  Does anyone want to cheer him up? There’s a tag board to the right ---------->  Don’t worry.  We’ll be back.

      That's the title of a variation of the song we'll be making soon.  Just kidding.  More like a description of last Saturday night's event.  Basically, the only people who were there were Roel's girlfriend's students (Happy birthday, Jen!) and the bands.  Balloon Derby didn't even come, so it was only us, Soft Pillow Kisses, Gish and Soapdish.  Despite multiple plugs on NU 107, people didn't come.  Some people whom Allan had invited came, but were confused by the sign outside which said, "Pitong Stop", instead of "Pit Stop", so they ended up leaving anyway.  No use quibbling whose fault  that   was... guess it was too sudden to expect people to turn up.  It was ok.  Ayn and I arrived at around a quarter to ten.  Roel was already there with Jen, as usual.  We ordered tokwa't baboy and a few drinks.  The staff were nice to us, so I won't bitch :)  I think even that woman who I don't like was there, and she didn't hound us or anything.  Tiffany said hi to us, no doubt remembering our last conversation under the influence of alcohol.  I shyly said hello.  Hope she didn't misconstrue that as artifice.  The other bands arrived and we all watched "Desperado" on AXN while waiting for Allan, who was fashionably late (harhar).  Gish opened the night with songs from Coldplay, Radiohead, and a few originals.  I think Popo sang better than the guest Stonefree guy, who's probably too used to singing their own songs to resist the temptation to do vocal gymnastics. Urk.  Then we played.  Jeff of Soapdish requested "pretend we're smart" but you know how Allan gets whenever people request.  Jeff made faces at me for that.  Then Soapdish played and they were good, as usual.  They're better than most of the bands I hear on the radio, and they're catchy enough to be popular, so I don't know why they're still stuck playing with us hehehe.  Anyway, it's always fun to have them around.  Soft Pillow Kisses ended the night with a few of their long lost originals.  It was refreshing, and I think Louie is really improving :)  See? It just takes a lot of getting used to singing with Allan, dear.  After that, Ian and 8 of Cheese passed by to show Allan a video of their performance at the Muziklaban finals.  I don't know why.  We stepped outside and realized that someone had again changed the title of the event into "soppotting".  How appropriate.  We then headed on to Mister Kebab where we starved for about half an hour before they finally brought us our food.  Hmm.  We have no idea what's in store for us anytime soon.

      We’re playing at Millennia tonight and the event is haphazardly entitled: PIT STOP. Please pass by.  Soapdish, Balloon Derby and Soft Pillow Kisses are playing, too, and I think there are other bands lined up as well. Ralph is alive, thank god, and so are we. See you tonight!

      Kami lang yung na-cancel. We can't play tomorrow night because Roel has work tomorrow. He has to leave Manila in the afternoon. This sucks vacuum I know. I hope that Allan has texted the organizer about it already. The rest of us might still go there to watch the gig. To the readers, punta parin kayo.  Allan told me that Sonnet LVIII's drummer will be sessioning for us. I hope that we can practice with him anytime soon so this won't happen again.  Ano meron sa Millennia sa saturday?

      RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALPHHHHH!  Ano bang nangyari sayo?  All of us have been texting you and calling you up on the phone about our gigs, but you never answer.  When we call Charmaine’s phone up, a guy answers and shuts the phone on us (although, she’s probably changed numbers, we don’t really know…).  What’s happened?  Are you still alive?  Where are you? Do we have to file a missing persons report?  Something is fricking wrong with your phone, man.  Hindi na tuloy kami nakatugtog nung Wednesday kasama ang Kamikazee at Monsterbot.  Anyway, we’ll probably be playing late tomorrow night because Allan and Roel will still have to be coming from the Oktoberfest in Libis (because of Moonstar 88).  We might be playing on Saturday night, I don’t know where yet.  Keep posted.  And if you find Ralph, send an email to the mailing list.  Baka taong-grasa na siya ngayon na lumilibot sa harap ng Mayric’s, huhuhuhuhuhu…. *sniff*

"ey, apple," we say and she says, "ey, dudes. where we feeling all hungry and moufalicious tonight? birthday boy gotta eat you know." and allan's like, "missy, we get wit lara first, you know, then ghooooeeeyyy and tintin tino, man." and we all like, "yeeeaaaahhhh. we cool we tat."  so we go get wet white whistle lara. and lara's like, "yeah" and we cool, we say "laralaralaralaralaralaralarayeah!" so we fly to tayuman in the magical mystical tour besta to get the baabaablacksheepalish tintin tino.  and tintin's like, "Heyow!" and we're, "heyow!" so we all go straight to allan's because one and one make three times the fun for everyone. no ghoooooeyyyy.  we come up to allan's and the four stooges are sitting on the curb with their potions of death and decay.  mr. death himself catches all someday, says third eye open and they're right cuz he's there all longhaired and weird looking with his snout in the air.

      Happy birthday to our founder and friend, Allan Montero! We hope you have a great one this year :)  “Speak to me in a language I can hear Humor me before I have to go Deep in thought I forgive everyone As the cluttered streets greet me once again I know I can’t be late, supper’s waiting on the table Tomorrow’s just an excuse away So I pull my collar up and face the cold, on my own The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet At the blasphemy in my old jangly walk Steeple guide me to my heart and home The sun is out and up and down again I know I’ll make it, love can last forever Graceful swans of never topple to the earth And you can make it last, forever you You can make it last, forever you And for a moment I lose myself Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world I’ve journeyed here and there and back again But in the same old haunts I still find my friends Mysteries not ready to reveal Sympathies I’m ready to return I’ll make the effort, love can last forever Graceful swans of never topple to the earth Tomorrow’s just an excuse And you can make it last, forever you You can make it last, forever you…”  --- The Smashing Pumpkins,  Thirty-three

      There was practice last night for both Soft Pillow Kisses and candyaudioline.  Ayn picked me up at around 9 and we headed to Lara's boyfriend's condo to fetch her.  I kept texting her that we were on our way, but when we arrived there, she wasn't waiting downstairs.  We texted her some more, miss called her, threatened to leave-- still nothing. So Ayn and I decided to get down and ask the guard if she was really there. I also asked Allan to call her up from Alberto's.  We went into the lobby of Sterten and noticed the cool Mediterranean colors.  Ayn and I were at first reluctant to sit in the waiting area because it looked like something out of someone's art nouveau living room or something; we were afraid that somewhere there was this teeny tiny sign saying "do not sit'.  But then, being kapal mooks anyway, we sat down.  The guard wasn't at his post where all the hidden cameras were and Ayn kept commenting about his carelessness heheh.  She looked like a bitch queen on her throne, and I her chimay-in-waiting (wala nang space sa cool sofa).  Finally, dumating yung guard.  "Sir, kilala niyo ba si Lara?" Ayn asked.  "Lara…"  "Lara ni Leo."  "Ahhh… Lara ni Leo. Oo.  Sino po sila?"  "Pakisabi naman po na naghihintay kami sa baba.  Sabihin mo si Ayn."  "Ano? Hay?"  "Ayn."  "Hine?"  "AYYYN."  "Hiiii--"  "Ah, ser, pakisabi na lang po, si Selena," I interrupt.  "Ahh.. Silina. Sige."  So we wait a couple more minutes, wondering what's taking Lara so long.  Suddenly, the elevator opens and out comes Lara with her eyes larger than usual, wearing her usual overcoat and something weird underneath-- an olive green spaghetti blouse and marine blue, hawaiian designed boxer shorts.  "Uy, sorry talaga, puyat na puyat ako so nakatulog ako. Hindi ko alam nandyan na pala kayo. Di nga ako nagbihis tsaka nag- toothbrush eh," sabay takip sa bibig niya. Hehehe.  We head on to Alberto's where Allan, Roel, Charles and Louie had just arrived a few minutes before.  There were a lot of people there, probably trying to take advantage of the fact that the following day would be a holiday.  Nothing was free until much later so we had to tambay for a really long while.  We amused ourselves with other things: Louie in her FEU uniform and how she looked like a high school student in it, Allan and Charles' lover's quarrels, Roel's weirdness, Ayn and her crush on that bearded man Roel knows, me and my usual whatever characteristics, Mike the driver and his laser pointer which he used to annoy us by pointing it at our body parts.  Oh yeah, there was that tabloid Allan fished out of Ayn's van and the article he read aloud to us entitled "Mr 8 Inches".  Hehehe… "Katuwaan" pala ha…  And then practice.  Ralph actually arrived, which was weird because Charles was supposed to practice with us as a sessionist.  But that was ok, since we missed Ralph anyway.  Allan still had Charles play along with us, which made the guitars really thick and rich on some of the songs.  Ang sarap ng "Empty You"… although nasapawan yung amazing leads ni Ralph… pero masarap yung kapal ng sound. Nakakahigh hehe.  We practiced a few more generic candy set staples before Allan decided to launch us all into "Together" again, probably hoping Charles could add something to it.  Ang ganda. Ok na ok rin.  Later, after practice, we commented on how charles' addition to the song really worked and I said, "But how are we gonna pull that off at actual performances without him?" and Allan said, "then you do it!"  "Good luck sa plucking!"  Anyway, it was good.  Ayn and Roel left soon after our practice and SPK took the studio.  Ralph and I hung out in front.  He tied my hair with some straw for me :)Then (tinatamad na ako) SPK came out and we all went to Timog Food Plaza to have some Zamboanga chicken.  Then we went home.  Iba na talaga pag tamad ka and you're stuck in the office on a holdiay because you need the extra cash. Hehe.  Happy birthday nga pala kay Eric of Popular Days.  Teewneewneew neew….

      Saturday, November 22 was the day of Tristania's birthday party and November's Buzz Night.  Allan and I were late because Cubao was trafficky and we had a hard time beating all those early Christmas shoppers at Megamall.  I had to buy things for my baby nephew; he bought a new guitar (as a birthday gift to himself)-- we shared a gift for Tristania.  Charles met us at the mall earlier to help him out with evaluating the guitar but he had to nix Ayn's party because he had promised to pick Louie up at Monumento that afternoon. Yehoo.  But we were terribly late for Tristania's party, which was a horrible thing to do, being a ninong and a ninang.  Ayn was texting us demanding where we were.  I was worried that there weren't any people there-- it was a relief to discover once we arrived that there were plenty of kids already there enjoying the games.  Charms, Jovy and Jovan of Matilda were there, sitting with Ayn, who, in spite of the hassle that comes with organizing a children's party, looked calm and dignified.  Things were already in full swing.  There were the clowns (ok, Allan, WHO has the p and f syndrome now? Hehe), the balloons, the little kiddies in their fairy tale costumes (tristia's cousin was so cute in a Snow White ensemble!), and the doting titos, titas, mommies and daddies coaching their kids during the games.  Allan couldn't fit into the tiny chairs so he opted to stay inside and catch a few winks (after eating, of course).  Soon, Ralph and Charmaine arrived (we thought they weren't going to come so it was a pleasant surprise) and we went inside to look at Tristia's picture albums while Ayn catered to her other guests.  It was fun to see how Ayn creatively arranged the pictures and how we at the band were sprinkled here and there throughout Tristia's young life.  I mean, we may have been late for her birthday party, but we've surely been there for her and Ayn along the way.  It was nice to remember those first months when the idea of Tristia being a part of our lives and Ayn's role as a mother were new and exciting.  The pretty little celebrant was dressed as the Blue Fairy and she was pretty happy with the little cheese stick she constantly clutched in her hand, even when Ayn's friends would bother her with their cooing and clucking over her cuteness.  Jovan and I loved Tristia's silver shoes and Charms wished she could borrow her fairy wings for the Matilda gig that night.  Later, Tristia changed into a frilly pink dress for the candle-blowing ceremony (with, of course, her cheese stick in hand).  The clowns made us ninongs and ninangs and titos and titas make wishes for her.  Me: I wish for you, Tristia, all the opportunities in life and the courage to take them.  Charms: I wish for you all the good things in life. *kiss*  Allan: Sana hindi ka tumulad sa nanay mo…  Ralph: Sana maging masaya ka sa buhay.  Charmaine: I wish for you good health…  Jarek: Sana hindi ka maging atheista…  Ngyarks. Hehe. Pero we had our good intentions, especially since we love Tristia and Ayn so much.  We sat around and drank a bit as the party settled down and night came.  Mingled with Ayn's other friends, some of who had kids of their own.  Roel was at a Kamikazee gig and couldn't come.  Suddenly, Ayn decided to come with us to Buzz Night so candyaudioline could play.  We were worried because she still had to take the LAE the next day, but she said she could do it and we were also glad that we had the opportunity to perform together again.  We assured Tita that we'd let her go home right away.  So we arrived at Buzz Night.  There were some people there already, but not many.  Candyaudioline started setting up; of course, Allan just had to try out his new guitar.  I panicked because my voice started to give.  It suddenly disappeared and all that was coming out of me were hoarse croaks.  Ayn wanted us to sing "Broken to Pieces" first, but since my voice was cracking, I thought maybe "Flaming Walls" would be a wiser choice so I could warm up.  Ahem.  I bombed.  I couldn't feel nor hear my voice.  Piyok City.  Pero go pa rin.  I just talked the audience through it, told them minamalat ako at pasensiya na hehehe.  Dinaan ko na lang sa feelings at attitude. Hahaha! Nakakatawa, but I somehow pulled through it all.  Ang saya sana kasi ang ganda ng tugtog nina Ralph nun, as in ang lakas tapos balanse silang lahat.  Couldn't help but swoon during the last measures of "An Empty You".  Actually, masaya siya talaga, and people enjoyed it kahit papano because they were clapping enthusiastically… a lot more came in after out first song, which was fortunate for the other bands as they had a bigger audience. It was fun.  Sunset Drive played next with their brand of emo.  They were nice because they weren't really sure they could come at first, and they made it.  They played a good set.  Then came Balloon Derby, ever reliable.  Then Popular Days, Band of the Night.  I say this because they were really tight and they gave a really good performance, just like last month.  Buzz Night was actually Tweetums Night because, when introducing "Watch Out For Me", Charles added, "Para kay Louie", which sent us all "yiheeeeing".  Feel na feel nga niya yung performance hehe.  What's funny was that, when Soft Pillow Kisses sang "Special Day", Louie also said, "Para kay Charles" which sent us "yiheeeeeeeeing" as well, but also laughing because of the meaning of the song. Aaaaaawww. Ahwuhwuh nuhmun, Charles!  Tapos, pati si Allan nagpa-tweetums sa "Stay Here For a While". Teehee.  Nagulat yata yung Weedisneys dun, eh. Hehehe.  Nag short acoustic set din yung Spring Boutique.  Last band for the night was Weedisneys because they came from Rock Radio Café, Alabang pa-- buti nakasunod pa sila! Ok nga eh kasi ang galing ng set nila kahit four songs lang, at syempre dahil pa tinugtog nila uili yung "Paranoid Android".  Halata pala na maraming nagbabasa ng blog nato kasi sa opening riffs, nagtinginan ba naman lahat sakin!  Radiohead kicks ass (hi, thom ;*) hehehe.  Buzz Night was great because people we hadn't expected to come had arrived (Sunset Drive, Spring Boutique and Weedisneys) and also the ever faithful Buzz performers were still there (Popdays and Balloon Derby). Here's looking forward to next month!

      We were supposed to play last night at UP, but my powers weren't working and Ralph really had to beg off from playing.  When Allan told me this yesterday afternoon, I became so upset because I had my heart set on playing again, especially since it was UP.  But, of course, we all have to extend the same courtesy towards Ralph as we did to Allan and Roel-- work is always important.  I got home and went online and found Ralph on YM.  Told him we missed him and we were sorry he couldn't play.  He sounded very regretful, too, and explained that the company had this big client who needed a project done by this Friday; as of the time we spoke, they hadn't done half of it yet.  He sounded really distressed.  I told him we understood if he had to work... he sounded so relieved about that.  I could tell he really was sorry we couldn't play because of him and that he wanted to if he could.  We said bye and good luck and dc-ed.  Instead of us, Allan had Soft Pillow Kisses play.  That was also nice because we got to see the Manyaks and Louie and Lara again.  Ayn and I decided to tag along anyway.  I showed Ayn and Allan where I worked (right underneath the venue) and we all hung out together.  It was just kind of boring there because we arrived so early and they all ended up playing at 11:30, 1 or 2 hours later than the original plan.  It felt like we had been there the whole day.  Not many people were there, probably because it was very early in the semester and nobody knew much about the event.  The crowd had dwindled considerably by the time SPK went onstage to perform their four songs.  They played a really good set and "Bathing in the Sun" was especially beautiful because it bounced off the domed roof and echoed throughout the hall.  Of course, the crowd was really sleepy because they were really waiting for Moonstar 88 and Cheese, who both gave very short but very sweet sets.  Then we went to Pares to eat.  People weren't talking much haha... I wonder why.  Maybe we were all tired.  Some of us had other things on their minds.  John Paul and Lara though were really goofing off with their OPM medley, influenced by the complimentary Ginebra San Miguel Blue from the organizers.  We then went our separate ways, and who knows what happened to each of our little groups after that...?

      Magpapanovena na ba ako? Sana nga lang makatugtog tayo bukas.  Don't get me wrong-- i understand Ralph is pretty busy these days, pero i'm just really wishing and trying to will it into reality. Dapat nga ngayong gabi sa Mayric's pero di rin yata kaya, and I think di na rin tuloy yung Moonstar 88 dahil walang boses si Acel.  mwahaha, speaking of Acel losing her voice, something funny happened yeesterday.  basta... kaya ko palang abutin yung mga kanta nila.  buti sana kung alam ko rin yung lyrics (ultimong "torete" ba naman di alam!)...  hehehe.  punta na rin kayo tomorrow. masaya yun. i decree na kakayanin ni ralph hehe!

      (Allan, sino sha?)   soft pillow kisses/candyaudioline --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Over the course of last month, I noticed one very patient person with a terribly slow connection downloading a shoegaze video off of me. After a few weeks, when he finally got the whole thing, I dropped him a congratulatory line. Got to talking with the guy and he directed me to his music. Turns out he plays with a couple of unsigned bands in the Phillipines called soft pillow kisses and candyaudioline. I grabbed a couple of songs off of him and really liked what I heard.  To give a point of reference, candyaudioline has a Lush Lovelife sound and soft pillow kisses sounds a bit like perhaps The Sundays. Somebody else could probably come up with a more accurate reference. Hardly matters, the songs are lovely in and of themselves. The female vocals slay me. This guy, Allan, is very heavily influenced by Loveless era MBV and early Ride, so if you think you might like something shamelessly influenced by that, then seek out his music. I'll suggest "Felt so Fine" by candyaudioline and "I Don't Know What to Say" by soft pillow kisses because those are the songs he suggested to me.

      Ayn texted me this morning asking where my office was.  I told her where but that I wasn't there yet because I was late (hehe).  She told me to pass by the restaurant near my office.  So I dropped in on her and Jarek at Chocolate Kiss.  They were having a delicious grilled chicken sandwich (sorry, I'm hungry right now and I remember ordering that before ;) and resting after they had just prerogged for bowling... or some other thing they had to do that led them to Chocolate Kiss, I don't know.  All that mattered was that Ayn was there.  She told me Tristia has recovered from her fever and that she's normal and as noisy as ever.  I was so relieved to hear that.  She didn't go to her first class with Santos (my favorite lit teacher from UPDECL, because he looks like he'd really rather be doing something else for a living hehe)... I forgot to tell her that it was ok because Sir never goes to class in the first week just to avoid prerogs.  Anyway, it was great seeing her at an hour too early to associate with her and candyaudioline haha.  Refreshing.  And it worked. Had a good day today.  Burned her a candy cd because she doesn't have copies of the songs yet! Weird!  Anyway, I took care of that in a jiffy.  Had to leave at around 10 am to get back to work.  Come to think of it, I should have grabbed some fries off her plate. *rumble, rumble*  *  By the way, we're playing on the 17th at Mayric's along with Moonstar 88 and Kamikazee.  Be there!  Buzz Night is on the 22nd.  We probably won't play, but it's good to support the indie scene.

      We fronted for Parokya ni Edgar last night at 70’s Bistro.  Ayn picked me up and we found Roel, who had been there since 7 pm (we arrived at 9:30), tired and sleepy.  Allan arrived at around 10:15 and the manager of 70’s kept asking us to set up, only Ralph wasn’t there.  Just as when we were really getting nervous, he finally arrived, bugnot and tired.  There was no sign of Parokya yet so we anticipated a long set.  I didn’t feel confident with the first song, “Flaming Walls” because I couldn’t hear my voice so well… but after warming up with that, the next few songs were a breeze and I started enjoying the set. Sumasayaw pa nga ako, and I couldn’t really help it because it did feel good to be there. It was laid back; 70’s begged us to keep it that way, I think, it being a small venue.  We had to keep the volume of our guitars at bay… that didn’t stop us from giving a rocking set, though.  The manager said we were still a little too loud hehe.  Syempre may mga sablay kami ng konti, pero astig pa rin, tsaka enjoy tumugtog ulit.  Dapat talaga wala kaming practice pag may tugtog.  The people enjoyed us, too, even if they were really, really, really there for Parokya ni Edgar.  Some of them were foot tapping and head banging (haha), and they clapped appreciatively.  It’s fun to play for crowds like that, too, because you can feel the respect they have for your efforts, which is always appreciated.  Soft Pillow Kisses minus Louie were there to support us.  I think Lara’s “yeah”s and really loud claps supported the illusion that we were appreciated hehe.  It was great to see Pillow again, especially since Allan hasn’t been playing with them much and it has seemed that candy has been getting the exposure recently.  Hindi naman daw, sabi niya… nagkakataon lang.  I’m sure Pillow will be gigging again soon.   They had to leave early and Ayn did too (Because Tristania’s sick! Boo!), so sabay sabay silang lahat.  Naiwan kami nina Roel, Ralph at Allan, and when Parokya was fully set up, we decided to grab some grub.  I suggested the Sikatuna Pares, so we hopped onto an empty jeep.  First time naming mag-jeep na magkakasama (although I remember nag-jeep kami dati nina Roel at Allan from EDSA to Mister Kebab nung tumugtog kami sa San Pedro).  Sayang wala si Ayn. Ralph lay down on the seat because there was so much space— ako rin hehe.  Wala lang.  Trip. Nakakatakot nga kasi ang bilis ng takbo tapos feeling ko mahuhulog kami.  So nag-pares na nga kami.  Ok naman. Masarap. Panalo talaga yung pares dun compared sa pares ng tapat ng Millennia.  Wag niyo lang daw i-order yung Katsudon, sabi ni Ralph.  Pero ok talaga yung chicken rice ng Partners Pares.  So we went back to 70’s and waited for Parokya to finish, which happened around 2 am.  Then we all went home.  Fin.

      Saturday was a bit blah because people were tired and had problems at work that prevented the night from sailing smoothly.  Roel was caught somewhere far away with Cheese.  Allan was worrying about the Moonstar Cuneta Astrodome thing and the night’s benefit gig for Allan B. at Music Warehouse Manila.  We were supposed to pick Ayn up at Mayric’s by nine but due to unavoidable circumstances arrived there at 10, where she was languishing at a SKA event.  Well, at least she had Speedy G. to keep her company hehehe.  When we were about to leave for Music Warehouse, Lara walked in with her boyfriend.  She was so surprised to see us and she begged us to keep her company, except that we had to go already.  She kissed Speedy G. first, though, as per Ayn’s wishes.  We arrived at Music Warehouse where Moonstar was about to begin their set.  During soundcheck, people were dancing to R&B and disco.  On our way to the stage, Ayn started pulling me and Allan towards the dance floor.  We thought she was joking, until we were actually stepping onto it— Allan laughed and begged off desperately, saying he had to attend to business.  I, on the other hand, felt helpless as we joined the gyrating throng.  For a split second, Ayn and I just looked at each other crazily and, as if on cue, we started waving our arms and dancing like the others!  It was so bizarre!  And then, I guess we realized how ridiculous we looked (and maybe we couldn’t really stomach it anymore hehe) so we laughed and made our way to backstage.  I wonder if Kamikazee saw us hehehe.  We wanted to be one of the front acts, but Roel was nowhere in sight and we were told to wait.  So Ayn and I had two beers each by the rear air conditioners.  I started feeling really cold and sleepy and tired.  Allan gave me his jacket but I still felt really bad and queasy.  Ayn took Ralph with her to fetch someone from Alberto’s but I asked to stay because I felt like I would puke if I moved too much.  I stayed at a table near the board so Allan could watch over me from there.  I couldn’t take it anymore, so I fell asleep for a while, and when I woke up, I felt slightly better but quite bugnot.  Bad trip kasi pag pagod.  It was our turn… they told us our set had been reduced to three songs because people wanted to dance already and there was still Cheese to perform.  So we did our set.  I was kind of sullen, especially since there was this guy who was screaming at us to get off the stage because they wanted to dance already, but I also liked the feeling up there because it was so loud.  On that stage, you feel like Supreme Ruler of the World.  It was a good set, performance-wise.  Anyway, it turned out that Cheese didn’t perform anymore so we could all go home early and those buffoons in the audience could osterize their brains in their skulls to the beat of the house showband’s music.  We decided to go to Klub 102 because it was indie night and people had been texting us that everyone was there.  However, we only arrived at around 3 am, and they had all just left.  We were the only people there aside from the waiters, Joseph and the two DJs.  Allan was depressed about that because he had been hoping to see his friends.  Lara texted Allan so he could tell Ayn that so many guys had thought her beautiful while she was waiting for us at Mayric’s.  That brightened her up a bit, but I guess the fact that we were all alone at Klub 102 was just overpoweringly sad.  So… we left after half an hour.  And that was quite depressing.  Oh yeah, I took out the zonkboard because it’s supposed to be purchased.  Oh well, I’ll try to find a free tagboard elsewhere.  For now, kitakits sa mailing list. Join kayo, may link sa taas ng blog.  Oh yeah… and I’ll try to return the popdays link someday… it got erased when I cleaned the blog’s template.  See ya!

      We’re all friends, of course.  It just so happened that in the heat of stress and emotions and the wish to fulfill promises made, even the best of friends can falter.  Ayn and I arrived on time at Millennia for the Matilda EP Launch in the hopes that we could perform SOMEHOW.  Charles was there, having just fixed Ayn’s bass, and as Allan requested he accompanied us for the night.  There was a little personal surprise Ayn had in store for us that night, but it’s something too delicate to tell.  It just concerns Tristania, whom she had brought that night and proudly showed off to Matilda fans and friends alike.  Tristania was so cute in her denim dress and bonnet, but sleep had made her ornery and she just chose to cling to her mother for the rest of the time she was there.  Ayn sent her home after a while, having achieved her purpose for the night.  Matilda’s EP launch was successful and well-planned.  Jovan was kind enough to give us our food stubs, even if there really was no way for us to play that night. Charms, in her black dress and fisherman’s hat, reminded me of a prettier Jeepers Creepers hehehe.  The rest of the band were decked in red and white.  Their first set, after sets from friends Kiko Machine and Lester Canon, was a series of covers with the various sessionists they had worked with at one time or another.  Ayn was slated to play “Cornflake Girl”, and though she had hesitated on a few first notes because she thought it was still part of soundcheck (hehe), she gave a powerful thump to the Matrilda rendition.  Ang galing nila (Matilda), especially when their violinist Maricor does her thing.  All throughout the gig, we were texting Allan and asking if he could still make it.  He sounded very distraught and stressed out.  Charms was disappointed because she really wanted to hear us play “Flaming Walls”; she even talked it over with the band and they decided to let us play even after their final set, just so we could.  Sadly, even that was impossible.  We were embarrassed, but there really was nothing anyone could do because even Allan and Roel wanted to play— but they had work, which was also very important.  Matilda understood, of course.  We thanked them for inviting us and left for Klub 102 when the night was over.  Charles had invited Chi of Millennia to join us at Klub 102 where we were to meet Allan later that morning.  He didn’t look to sure, but he said they’d try… he asked if he could bring Diego of Monsterbot and some friends.  Of course, we agreed.  So there we were, Ayn and Charles and I, at Klub 102, waiting.  We were waiting for Allan.  We were waiting for Chi, but thinking they probably wouldn’t be able to follow because we had heard that Tiffany and the rest of the group at Millennia were heading to Nakayama in Matalino to drink.  Around half an hour later, Chi arrived with Diego, Ge and Bea.  We were pleased that they had come, even if it was such an impromptu plan.  They found the place cool, and were looking eagerly at the Joy Division, Killing Joke, Robert Smith, Sid Vicious posters. “Uy, pare, may Moshi Moshi record pa dito o.” Hehe.  “British na british dito a.”  They had fun listening to the music, and it reminded me of the first time we drank there.  They were thinking of songs to request... they thought Kulb 102 was cool.  We talked to them also; it was the first time we hung out with them.  Chi was introducing me to their other friend (Um, I think her name was Jen… sorry, by that time I was tipsy and the music was loud and I couldn’t hear well) and he couldn’t tell her what my name was because WE had never been introduced.  “Selena,” I said, shaking their hands and to Chi, “That’s ok.  We’d never been introduced.  I have this picture of the two of us together and when I had to name the file, I named it “Selena and Some Guy’.”  We laughed at that.  Diego is actually my nephew in some weird way.  My first cousin is his dad’s first cousin… I think it’s that close.  This is all by affinity of course.  He didn’t remember me right away though.  “What??? You didn’t remember me? Then why were you saying hi to me at gigs all these months? Who did you think i was?”  “I don’t know… I recognized you, but I didn’t know from where!  But yeah, I remember we were ushers at Ate Bon’s wedding with sina Armee…”  Haha. Weird.  So by the time we were buzzed, we were telling all the people around the table, “Hey, I’m his TITA!”  and “Hey she’s my TITA!”  Sheesh.  But at least now, we can really talk when we see each other because we’re sure hehe.  He promised he’d burn me an eggboy cd one day… and I’ll probably give him some candy too.  There was this really funny thing that happened.  Ayn told Diego that he looked like LA Lopez, and all of us were laughing.  He was indignant at first, “Hindi naman ha!  Jao Mapa, pwede pa! Hahah!”  and then in two seconds he suddenly burst out with, “Eh kasi BATA!” which set us guffawing anew.  Oh, man.  You should have seen that.  It was great… as Ayn said before about our first Klub 102 experience, this one had “good vibes”.  Allan arrived really late because he couldn’t get away from Cheese right away.  He’d already downed a liter and a half of Red Horse before then.  But he sat and talked with us until sina Chi had to go.  Oh yeah, I’d like to thank the girl who arrived, Jen (?), for being so nice to us and sharing her red wine with us.  Thank you so much.  And that was it for Friday night.

      "We live in a beautiful world.... yeah, we do." - Coldplay  Um, I talked to Ayn this morning and she said she and Allan talked already.  Just wanted to report this, in case you were all worrying.  I have to admit that I let a few tears go after reading the last two posts... but things are ok now.  Just wanted to dispel any rumors that might start...  thank heavens for friendship.

      "Cut Dead" is also a Jesus and Mary Chain song. It's not one of my all-time favorite songs (but what the heck) and it's up to you if you think this has something to do with this entry. This is my reaction to what Allan had posted:  The thing about my band started out with the plans to play for the Matilda EP launch tonight. Being one of the bands who had given much help and support for Matilda, we have been invited to play for their much awaited EP launch. Charms had invited the band through me over a month before the schedule. Since there had already been a definite schedule for the launching, I had informed my bandmates about the gig. Given the hectic schedule of my bandmates due to their work, I waited for their confirmation before I told Matilda that we can play for their event.   Two to three weeks before the gig, my bandmates had given me the confirmation. It was only then that I told Matilda that we can be lined-up. Everytime I see my bandmates, I always reminded them about the gig (not only in person but also through texts and my posts on our blog) and I have asked them over and over again (to the point of becoming annoying already) if they really are sure about playing for that gig. They had all been saying yes. And once again, at the last minute, they’ll take back their answer and tell me that they can’t play after all.  It would have been okay if I know that I wasn’t able to remind them enough; it would have been okay if they never gave me confirmation that we can play; it would have been okay if the "last minute decision" was made earlier; it would have been okay if this sudden change of decision only affects us and not another band that has spent countless nights of having no sleep just to plan for the event (they could have lined some other band up for this gig if they only knew that we can’t play); it would have been okay, if this isn’t the second time that this shite has happened.  I’m a bit bothered about Allan’s “never understand” (taken from a track off the Jesus and Mary Chain's The Complete John Peel Sessions album) post on our blog. I’m not really sure if I’m the one he’s pertaining to in his post--but if that was all about me, I guess I’d have to say that the feeling is mutual.   The only reason why I am making such a big deal out of my being pissed at this whole thing is because  I care for my band . I care so much for my band that I’ve never really been able to study for school in favor of gigs and practices; I care so much for my band that I've missed so many family gatherings and dinners (including my father's birthday) in favor of gigs and practices; I care so much for my band that there had been countless nights when I wasn't able to sleep beside my daughter and consequently not spend the day with her because I had to catch up with my sleep during the day in favor of gigs and practices; and lastly, I care so much for my band that I've been trying to get us gigs or have been welcoming invitations from other events (instead of pre-occupying myself with better things) so as we can get more exposure that we deserve. I actually do think that we are worth more than just a Backbeat/Montero-Tan organized gig.  My concern for the band is neither petty nor irrational.    I share the same passion that my bandmates have (or whatever passion is left in them) for our band. It just so happens that aside from playing bass, this is the only contribution that I can offer. If my concern and my willingness to contribute is something that these people will only brush aside or look down upon, to the point that they think their indecisions shouldn’t really matter because this is nothing but a sorry show of pettiness and irrationality, I guess I can’t help but think that my being a part of this band all boils down to nothing, that I am just a mere puppet (and perhaps even a mascot) and I was never a part of a team who should be working together for a common goal.  Besides, is there really a common goal amongst us members of Caudioline? Or have we been pretending that there is one since early last year?  Nothing new has been happening with the band. We’ve been stagnant for almost two years. The only thing that we’ve achieved so far is having a permanent line up since early last year. We may have recorded something, but it was only in vain. Nobody took the recording seriously-not even the recording technician/engineer (or whatever you may call Mr. Rozul) himself. We’ve never come up with a new song since Selena came in. For the past year, we were just satisfied with hearing good comments from people. That was enough to make us feel good about ourselves. That was enough for us to consider being stuck in an illusion that something must be happening with our band. Now… THAT, I think, is what one may call petty and irrational. Is it so wrong for me to act and do something to save whatever is left with this so-called band?  But what can I do? I’m just a small part of the band anyway. I never wanted to get sick of what has been happening with my band, or with the band itself. But that’s what they’re making me feel. There are four of them and I’m just one person. None of them will ever listen to me. So much for wanting to be of help.  I never wanted to call it quits. But judging from the way they have been treating me and my sorry attempts in helping out, I guess that’s what they really want. There’s nothing I can do.  I, too, am sick and tired of not being given appreciation for whatever I'm trying to contribute (not that I'm asking for it, but not pointing a finger at me because of wanting to help could have been enough)--no matter how minute they may seem for my bandmates. I, too, am a very busy person even if it doesn't show. I also have other priorities: my family, my daughter, my schooling, and my preparation for my future and my daughter's future. Real soon, I'll be joining the real world too and will also have a career besides being a single mother (I have no siblings to count on once my parents are gone and a so-so job can never feed me and my daughter).  Oh well. THIS "band thing" cannot kill me as well. I also have better things to do and worry about.  This is pointless. They, too, will never understand.  Allan was right: It was fun, but only for a while.

      "never understand" is one of my all time fave jesus and mary chain songs...  it is also what i'm feeling right this very moment... "i will never understand why some people seem to never understand why a certain situation, condition, concern or action should take into effect  and need to be accepted even with a heavy heart"... i am a very busy person with real life concerns trying my best to excercise my duties and responsibilities, to the best of my abilities, to my family, my special someone, people at work - even if they don't deserve it, my bandmates and friends and even to people whom i don't have any affilliation whatsoever... i'm really fed up... i'm tired of pleasing people who don't really give a fuck about what i feel... i'm tired of the people i know who only think about themselves, worry about their very petty, oftentimes irrational concerns...   last night we played at a benefit gig for a friend... it was fun actually but only for a while...  changes may have to be made... but i still wish it won't come to that point...  but what can i do?  They're the ones who want to make things happen... fine... it won't kill me naman eh...  but still, i will never understand...

      Hey. We practiced the other night.  Ralph still had a very bad ear ache, but Allan picked him up anyway.  Ayn picked me up and Roel met us there.  It was just the five of us, no manyaks nor boy/girlfriends around.  We were there to practice... and also to make me learn some more candy songs on the guitar.  Hmm. That euphoria that always comes with playing was there, as usual. It wasn't quite the polished candy feel we have at gigs because I was there to add my little flubs, but I think what mattered more at that point was that we were together, making an effort, striving towards the common goal of making good music.  We were pretty focused that night, but it wasn't forced... and when we went out for breaks, we'd be catching up on each other, say, telling Ralph about our Klub 102 experiences or talking about an interesting "diner" some of us had been to recently.  Just sharing stories, blah blah blah. Then back to practice.  We then decided to go to Allan B's mom's wake.  We arrived there to find Concrete Sam and Cheese and Kamikazee hanging out by the driveway of the funeral home.  So, you know, the usual small talk.  Ayn and I preferred to sit in the gutter and muse on the cobblestones.  Of course, we were also whispering about _____ and being all kilig about it. Hahaha.  Finally, Allan B. led us inside.  I noticed suot niya yung red shirt niya from the night before nung binisita namin siya ng mga manyak hehehe (tama bang ipagkalat yun...?).  So candyaudioline paid our respects.  The place had a light atmosphere, in spite of it all.  The guys were chatting with Allan B. Ayn and I stared at the flower arrangements; she told me that the name of the flower that I really liked on one corona was "stargazer".  We were discussing where one could possibly buy one of those morbid mass card holders, the ones with the severed hands for clamps.  I guessed the funeral home would probably point out their supplier to Ayn, if she asked them nicely.  After a while, we gave Allan B our condolences and set off for our favorite Pares Place in Kamuning.  It was a miracle that Roel was with us, still.  I couldn't help noticing again on the way there that it was the five of us-- pure, solid, untainted, still candyaudioline. The core.  It was amazingly satisfying to think of that.  At Pares, Allan and Ralph discussed the possibility of recording an album very soon.  The more they talk about it, the closer it gets to becoming a reality.   Candyaudioline   Allan Montero -  vocals, guitars  Ralph Romero -  guitars  Ayn Ruth -  bass  Selena Salang -  vocals  Roel Sotto -  drums   *  Upcoming gigs:  Tonight - Mayric's... all backbeat bands are playing a benefit gig for Susan Burdeos Friday - Millennia... Matilda EP launch.  Malamang baka sobrang aga kami tumugtog or sobrang late. Saturday - benefit gig uli for Allan B's mom.  Baka sa Music Warehouse Manila because that's what I overheard.  *  Ok na pala ako.  I've realized that there's a bigger picture.  No more worrying.  Just need more sleep.

      yes. i'm sick again.  after my roadie duties last last saturday (for kamikazee, the youth, and moonstar88 respectively), i was again bedridden for two days. which is weird since not a hint of rain was felt that day or any day before that. come wednesday i was so paranoid about possibly having dengue that i decided to have a medical check up. on my way home i met bespren romel, and told me of allan bords' mother's death. quite shocking, especially since i was with him the saturday before.  and then, last saturday, allan called up about the benefit gig for allan's mom. sometime after i put the phone down, i felt something pop on my left ear... which caused some pain,numbness and deafness on that area. paranoia struck me again. has candy's noisepop caught up with me? i tried to sleep the pain away, but after an hour of tossing and turning, the pain was becoming unbearable. again i went to the hospital to have my ear checked. again i had to take some medicine. arrrghh.  luckily, this earache won't spell the end of my days with candy. it still hurts as of this writing, though.  kitakits wednesday!

      I think Allan will be able to post more info on this very uninformative announcement, but on wednesday and saturday, Backbeat Management will be having benefit gigs for Allan Burdeos' mother, who passed away last Monday.  Allan B. is the drummer of Kamikazee.  I'm not sure which will be held at Mayric's and which will be at Music Warehouse Manila, but I think it'll be wednesday and saturday, respectively.  Please do come.  We're supposed to play for both, but this will entirely depend on Ralph's schedule as he has the most rigid one of all candy members (schedule, not anything else ;D).  The Matilda EP launch, well... Allan will also have to keepyou guys posted for that. Cross your fingers.

      So, come Halloween, Ayn took me to this Goth gathering at Absinth, Greenbelt.  First, we had to pick up a few Goths on the way, mostly guys.  Then we went to another Goth’s house (a girl) in Boni, where some of them primped up for the night.  Man.  That took three hours.  Imagine guys taking three hours to prepare for a party.  Guys asking each other to do each other’s hair… guys asking each other if they should wear this or that skirt, this or that bauble.  I tell you, it was like nothing I had ever experienced… guys  primping .  Ayn and I were so hungry by the time they finished, but the results were effective.  Lyra (the one who owned the apartment) looked especially striking in her very revealing corset and her bright red cloak.  We passed by PBCOM first to look at Lyra’s interior design exhibit.  We looked like a gang of vampires walking past the sets and people were really staring.  I wasn’t as scary-looking as the others, but I was wearing a long, dark dress, boots and my brown coat—at best I looked grunge-y indie.  Still, I think we looked pretty intimidating.  Carmi Martin the actress was one of the people who had an exhibit there, and for some reason, she felt like giving us a full explanation of her work.  We just sort of sullenly patronized her and nonchalantly walked off when she was finished.  Supernatural beings aren’t really interested in sunnily-motifed bathroom sets, especially if the designer doesn’t even know what kind of stone her own creation is made of.  Off to Greenbelt because we were really hungry.  Watched Late Isabel’s open air set while Goths were saying their hellos. Felt slightly like a fish out of water, but it wasn’t their fault. In general, club outings turn me into a wallflower.  Ayn, Lyra and I decided to go and sit inside Absinth.  The two actually ordered absinthe, which they said was really good but unbelievably, incredibly, stupefyingly potent.  Got to meet Paolo, who showed me a picture of his to-die-for Spanish boyfriend whom he had met on the Net.  Got to meet Maski (sorry if I spell it wrong), decked in  a priest’s outfit, who was so solicitous and kept asking if I was okay (I was very sleepy and it showed).  I was so tired, I decided to lie down on the couch and take a few minutes’ nap.  Annejo kept asking me to dance but I just felt too shy.  They were so nice to me.  Allan was supposed to go with us, but he had a gig in Dagupan with Moonstar 88.  I wondered aloud what he would wear if he had come along.  Ayn said, “Ano pa ba?  Eh di as Uncle Fester!” Haha :)  Patok siya, kung ganun…  Lyra made a comment, which I promised her I would put on the blog:  “I find it so weird that all these waiters are dressed like vampires and they have ‘blood’ smeared all over their mouths.  I mean, it’s kind of like eating a plate of spaghetti and having sauce all over your face and you not bothering to wipe it up.  It’s bad manners.”  “Yeah… yeah… I know what you mean.  But then again, maybe they just want to hint at this animalistic, barbaric side—like when animals eat they just dig in with their mouths and inevitably smear themselves with blood.  Maybe they want to hint at these primeval, base tendencies to make themselves scarier.”  “Honey, if you dress in black velvet, there can be nothing animalistic about you.”  Haha.  That was so insightful.  It just goes to show how these people take their lifestyle seriously.  No pretensions in  this  bitch queen.  At around 1 am, I was feeling really tired and Ayn, pretty shitty. She wanted to go home.  We were also really hungry.  I suggested we eat at Pares and said I would treat her for once.  We showed up there and the guard recognized us.  “Sir, pano yan? Meron pa ba para samin? Dalawa kami eh.”  “Ah, dalawang mesa?”  He obviously thought we had brought the whole bunch with us.  “Hindi! Kaming dalawa lang hehe.”  So Ayn and I sat at the counter and she started bitching about her night.  I totally agreed with her, but I was also hoping that she wouldn’t let it ruin Halloween for her.  Two guys sat beside us and ordered Pares.  They kept staring at us.  So did the other male customers.  I guess we looked strange and beautiful in our flowing garbs.  It contrasted with the way we were wolfing down our food. Mmm.  The funny part was, when I finally asked for the bill, the woman said it cost P227.  "What???" I only had P180 on me and I wondered how it got to be that high, since we had only ordered 1 meal and 1 drink each.  She thought we were with those two guys who had eaten Pares beside us! Crap!  They had already left! Crap, crap, crap! I told her I refused to pay for their meal.  She consulted the other waiter and ended up revising the bill anyway, which was a relief.  The nerve of those men!  Creeps.  We then decided to pass by Millennia.  Tiffany was there and she let us just walk inside.  We heard someone calling our name—it was Macky from Concrete Sam.  He looked so genuinely happy to see us, and in truth we were grateful to see a familiar face, hoping that the night would turn around for us.  Macky bought Ayn a beer at the Videoke place next door and asked where we came from.  Ayn proceeded to tell him about her shitty night.  These guys sitting at the front steps overheard her and they were playfully agreeing with her.  Ayn bit and started talking to them, too.  Macky introduced us to them (from Too Late the Hero)… Joe causally invited us to tag along and drink with them at the place beside Behrouz along Scout Rallos.  We agreed.  They were really nice to us, as well.  For one thing, we didn’t have any money, but they encouraged us to order… they were pleasantly surprised that we ate some isaw, originally thinking that we were the ugh-that’s-so-dirtyyyyyyy type.  Kahit naka-dress kami, cowboy pa rin kami.  I heard Joe say to someone, “Okay, no? may kasama pa kaming dalawang prinsesa.”  Hehe, how flattering.  A blackout actually happened while we were drinking and it made the night just a wee bit more interesting, having to talk and drink by candlelight.  It was cool… the punk guys were fun to hang out with and they were kind enough to let us, even if we had just met them.  So at around 5 am, we all promised to Friendster each other (!) and went our separate ways.  All in all, it was a good turnaround, right?  What a night…

      hmmm... what else can i say about tonight? ayn pretty much said most of it. these days, im not so talkative, am i? i'm just tired and have been catching up on sleep during free time. when work rolls in, i'll be talking off my mouth again (or, rather, typing off my fingers...)  one funny thing that we weren't able to catch on cam kanina: ayn let tristia stand behind allan where he was sitting.  she started playing with his head, slapping it with her open hand and then her fists. allan thought it was ayn doing it because it was so strong. then she started kissing his head... then she licked it haha!  we laughed and laughed because she obviously tasted something funny, what with the look on her face and the smacking of lips.  then she started biting his scalp, which, according to Ninong, really hurt, so we had to take her away. that was a kodak moment.  we'll be going soon. merry christmas!  p.s. ralph is a no-show!!! what the hell happened to you, man. we have our theories...

      " So messed up I want you here In my room I want you here Now we're gonna be Face-to-face And I'll lay right down In my favorite place And now I wanna be your dog..."   ... goes the lyrics of one Iggy Pop song that I used to like a couple of years ago. It was also a song that was featured (and covered by some obviously brit band) in the movie that we were watching earlier this evening-- "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels." The movie bloody rocked our brains out, mate! (*trying to imitate the accent of those pseudo-criminals in the movie*).  You're right, Allan, Selena and Charles are still here at my place... We followed that movie with a dose of "Super Friends" (Justice League of America) and some live videos of Stone Roses.. As I'm typing this now, I can hear videos of The Smiths playing down stairs. Allan just got himself a DVD copy of that.  Gotta rush back down stairs! Need to fill myself up with some more gin!   "...Now I'm ready to close my eyes And now I'm ready to close my mind And now I'm ready to feel your hand And lose my heart on the burning sands And now I wanna be your dog"

      di ako kasama sa kebab. i went ahead, di ba?  last night was also flattering, at least on my part. after our set, most of the bands kept asking the effects i used on... presumably "an empty you". ian (of cheese) mumbled something about my "amazing" (his words, not mine) lead on a certain song and when he couldn't figure what exactly he wanted to convey, he just said "basta, alam ni jomal title nun". :) acel was also very eager to learn what specific effect i used. i explained that i just stumbled upon it on my effects box, but charles said he used phaser when he sessioned for candy last year.

      Last night was a stupendous comeback, if i do say so myself hehehe...  Never mind that little beat flub in the middle of "An Empty You". The rest of it rocked, i assure you.  Friday night, Allan and I passed by the Cheese Millennia gig because he had to talk business with Roel.  Just as we are about to say goodbye, Roel hugs me and says, "Bandmate ko 'to eh..."  "Huh?  Allan, narinig mo ba yung sinabi niya??? BANDMATE daw niya ako?" Allan laughs. Roel hugs him, too, and says, "Bandmate ko din 'to eh!"  "What??? Am I hearing things? He called us bandmates!" I laugh in disbelief.  "Wala ka nang karapatang sabihin yun, gagu," teases Allan.  "Kayo naman... hindi naman eh..." Roel coos.  And that was that. Practice was set for Sunday night.  Practice was great, which kind of worried us for the next night because that usually spells a bad performance.  I got to play more guitar... they were planning to let me play for the Backbeat Christmas Party.  It was the 5 of us again, cheesy as it sounds, reunited.  After practice, we did our Pares tradition. We were all excited about the following gig because it would be our first in a month.  Popular Days were first up and they were amazing, as usual. Ayn really likes their new song because of the New Order undertones. It was our turn and we realized I couldn't play after all because their weren't enough amps to go around. Boo.  But we delivered a great set. Some Backbeat people who had only heard us play last night complimented Allan. It was great.  Other performers were Stonefree, Moonstar 88, Kamikazee and Parokya ni Edgar (sans Gab who is on his honeymoon with his new wife-- congratulations, Gab!).  Sorry to everyone who expected Cheese to play because of my announcements.  We all thought they would be there, but Robert turned out to have a Skychurch gig.  Anyway, for those fans who came, sulit pa rin naman because you got to see all those other great bands.  In fact, after Parokya, Buwi jammed with Popo and Robert Javier... and also Ian of Cheese joined for a song.  It was pretty cool... but we were kind of tired and hungry (we couldn't order the whole night because there was nowhere to sit-- full house!).  Finally, at around 3 am, we headed on to Kebab: Allan, Ralph, Ayn, Gilbert and I.  No ox-brain. No shawarma. But the stuff we ordered was still very comforting. Mmmm.  Tonight, we have an early gig at Eastwood, Libis... around 7:30 pm... Moonstar 88 will be playing, too. Be there!  To end this on a funny note, Charles, Allan, Kaye and I were talking on the phone earlier this afternoon. Charles said he talked to Roel:  "Balik Candy na tayo, ah..."  "Pare... I love musikh eh."  P*tang*nang banda 'to, oh...

      ...did I get that right?  Hey everyone! I haven't been posting here for the longest time. I guess maybe it's because there's nothing much to post anyway.  Just listened to the tracks online. Couldn't believe how I missed playing those songs (uy, nagpaparinig) most especially, "An Empty You." It was fun to see all of you yesterday night at Klub 102.  Lara's party was a blast! Too bad I wasn't able to join you guys with the dancing and all. Nagtatampo na nga ako kasi I noticed na mas close na si Selena at si Lara. Feeling ko para akong naagawan ng gurlfriend. He he. Seriously, I had to leave right away to do some errands (sinungaling!).  Since for sure we can't practice or play on Xmas break, I guess I'll just see you guys on 2004! By then, I hope, we've settled for a better drummer. Ang hirap mamili ano?  Anyway, gotta get a goin! Tristia's about to climb the stairs!  Thanks nga pala Selena and Allan for everything. We'll pay you back the next time we see each other. We really appreciate your help. *wink wink*  Hasta la bye bye!!!!!

      These people were present last night at Lara's birthday party at Klub 102: Allan, Me, John Paul, Popo, Kay, Apple, Luie, Charles, Ayn, Lara's sister, Lara's other companion (sorry, girls, failed to catch your names!) and Lara herself.  It was a night of booze, liempo, hotdog, squidballs, good music and funny dancing. Charles danced. I danced. Luie danced. Lara danced. Kay slam-danced with Popo (hehehe). Lara drove us home, even if she was tipsy-- that scared me a bit, but she got us home safely. She really liked her birthday celebration. It was her first in her life (having been born into a family that doesn't celebrate birthdays).  Gave Allan burned candyaudioline cds to give to Erap and this other guy who's offering to play drums for us.  We even gave Popo one because he said he was willing to session, but in his drunken state, he had left it on the table at Klub 102. We will have a drummer soon. yehey.  Ralph, sorry to hear about charmaine! Hope she gets well soon. Are you leaving for the province this vacation? Will we be able to play before the month ends?  will be posting birthday pics soon on the egroups. happy birthday, Lara!

      Thank god you guys have started posting again!  Allan happened to mention to Erap of The Youth last Friday that we had just lost a drummer and were looking for a replacement/sessionist.  He immediately volunteered himself.  At first, we thought he wasn't serious but he insisted and even "begged" with his hands locked in praying fashion for us to consider him.  He said it would be good practice for him with his own band, too.  Allan asked Robert Javier if it was ok and he liked the idea.  So I hope that pushes through.  It would be great to have the band active again in spite of seemingly insurmountable odds. Ahem.  Buzz Night was excellent!  It had a diverse lineup of emo, dreampop, shoegaze and so-far-unclassified bands, and everyone delivered! Nakakaasar nga kasi wala ang candyaudioline! But in the light of the new developments I have just stated, that problem will be addressed soon mwahaha. In any case, last Saturday was a success. We started on time and the evening's flow was smooth.  Daydream Cycle started the night after almost a year of not playing at Buzz Night.  They played some of their new stuff and some good covers. Sunset Drive was there; Softpillowkisses (almost seamless set, guys!); a newbie band called Tether (I liked their last song-- hope they play for Buzz Nights to come); Popular Days (grabe, need I say more??); TV Guide (thanks for coming at the last minute!); and Weedisneys.  Balloon Derby and Spring Boutique were no-shows, but the night was still good.  Marami pang tao, hehehe.  Yesterday, Allan, John Paul and I went to Lucena for a The Youth gig.  We were all sleepy from the night before, especially John Paul, whose eyes were puffier than usual.  Still, he did a great job roadieing for the band.  Allan and I went to Ayn's after that to talk to her about her problem.  She seems willing to give the matter more thought.  Tristania woke up while we were there and did her Otso-Otso dance for us (only Tristia has the power to make Allan sing even one syllable of that song).  ANG CUTE-CUTE NIYA TALAGA!!!!!  Tonight, Sir Charles and I will be at the UPIS fair because he's going to be a judge at their Battle of the Bands, along with Lara's brother.  Yehey!  "The future's so bright--- I gotta wear shadesssss!"  Eighties perky shit.

      Of course, I'd take him back if he wanted to come back.  Allan would say, "Nandyan na siya eh," and also, it's because we'd like to stick it out with him even further, if possible. Kakaiba din kasi yung chemistry nating lima--- biruin mo, we're all so different, but we get to produce something like this.  Not that to get someone new who could produce the same thing would be impossible… kaya din naman kung ayaw na talaga ni Roel. We're just saying that things are fine the way they have been, and if it were possible to keep them that way, we would.  But, of course, life goes on, and for now we are still looking for a new drummer.

      amen, sister selena.  as shocked as i was, i knew it was bound to happen sooner or later. that's why i wasn't that surprised when he chose to do that. being pessimistic won't help things, though. this band has suffered too numerous a line-up changes to slow down now. we're thinking of the next thing we should do -  that is, find a new drummer. Especially now since we are close to recording.  here's a question, though. IF roel decides to come back, do we accept him? if you ask me, why not, di ba?

      ... for lack of a better title.  it's too bad you won't be able to play this Buzz Night, Ralph... we were all hoping to play again.  However, there's still a chance we can since Charles knows some of the songs already and we've prepared him for situations like this. He might session for us that night; that is, of course, if we find a drummer in time.  Yes, let's rehash that subject.  I was surprised by reactions from the mailing list concerning Roel's departure.  Not that I didn't think that anybody cared about Roel, but I didn't think anybody cared,  in general .  Sometimes, when I write in this blog and in the mailing list, I forget that there are other people in it besides just us.  Anyway, as expected, a lot of people were disappointed about Roel's decision.  Some of them questioned our seemingly nonchalant reactions as members of the band (my own "any takers?" comment, Ralph's "ako na ang magda-drums sa recording!", and Ayn's "Ro-bert! Ro-bert! Ro-bert!").  Let me clarify these statements.   Of course  we're distressed at the loss of our drummer.  Roel wasn't just our drummer, either, but he was our friend and part of our candy family (yes, there exists such a thing).  Correction: he IS our friend.  We may poke fun at him from time to time, but nobody in this band is exempt from that kind of treatment.  In truth, his departure worries me a lot because this also means that we'll have to start over with someone new... which will also delay the production of our planned LP.  Roel was a good drummer, in spite of all his quirks, and this will be hard to top.  BUT... candyaudioline is still alive. Sure, we mourn the loss of Roel.  On my part, the reason why I joke about his going away is because it's my way of coping with it.  I can't say the same for Ralph and Ayn, but maybe to a certain extent, they're reacting the same way.  And who could forget the fact that we're all still clueless as to Roel's reasons for quitting?---- we're still in shock! So if we're cracking jokes about it, bear with us.  Also, we're aware of what needs to be done.  If Roel is tired of playing with us, we can accept that.  But we also need to find a replacement.  So here it is:   WE NEED A NEW DRUMMER  If you like our music, think you can handle it (what Roel's been doing for us these past years), and aren't really in it for a career so much as to have lots of fun, this job is for you.  Join our mailing list (see this blog's links) and send us a message. We'll get back to you.  That's all for now.

      Since I have no cellphone (damn that book launch) and I have no other way of contacting everyone, let’s talk business here:  Allan just left for Vigan and he’ll be gone touring with Moonstar 88 and Parokya ni Edgar until around midday Thursday.  He says he’ll text you guys about this, but he’s hoping we could practice sometime this week with or without him with a new drummer (hopefully Nelson of Sonnet 58 because we’ve given him a cd beforehand and he wants to play, but if you can also talk to your friend, Ayn, that would be good, too).  We’re hoping to be able to perform this Buzz Night.  Just post here if you have any reactions. I check regularly anyway.  Also, Ayn’s bass is still with Kerwin because he can’t find pieces for it yet.  His own bass is here at my house ready for pick up.  He says you can use it first, Ayn, because he knows you have a gig this Tuesday and he might not be able to have yours ready by then.  It’s good, they say, but you know… I wouldn’t know myself.  Hmmm… ano pa ba? Sana makatugtog tayo this Saturday! May bagong naka- line-up na banda dun. Ok naman din sila. Tsaka kita-kits tayo ulit :) Saya!

      Hmmm. My big question is: what gives with sudden resignations?  Is it so easy to leave this band?  In the past year alone we've had 3 quit threats (two of them and the latest one coming from one person). It's not as if kupal kaming kabanda. Nobody pressures anyone more than anyone else could take. We're so laid back, in fact.  I don't get it. Why is it so easy to say, "I quit"?  This is from an outburst from last Saturday at Sta. Lucia.  I don't know, but I was really disappointed when it happened.  Kala ko pa naman yung pinagmamalaki natin sa candy yung samahan, tapos basta-basta na lang ganun?  And then when I saw this person the next day, nothing, no reference to what happened, not even a hi.  Well, I didn't feel like it anyway because I was pissed at the hastiness of the decision.  Personally, i don't consider it much of a loss kung tuloy yung pag-quit niya.  The biggest reason why we stuck it out was because of friendship and samahan and perseverance... but performance-wise, there are other musicians out there who can do as well or even better. Kung paninindigan niya yung sinabi niya, we could respect that. Syempre, if that person takes it back, ok lang din kasi candyaudioline na rin naman siya.  But it would be so sad if we discovered that the rest of candyaudioline could actually do without ********, wouldn't it?...  Nakakaasar lang kasi ang dali para sa mga tao ang iwanan ang banda na to...  Anong say niyo, candymates?  I'm just pissed. Bear with my dramatics.

      i'd like to clarify what i said in my last post, which has been deleted because it offended some people.  it was a post  I  had written. Nobody else was at fault.  The names I mentioned in that post had nothing to do with the opinions I expressed in it. they were my own opinions.  the livejournal i was referring to, i could not even read! hence, the opinions i had about it were admittedly half-baked, therefore mostly bull. small wonder why it offended the writer. i hadn't meant to do that. i apologize.   however, i just want to request that any bad feeling that post had created be shifted towards myself, since i was the author of that post. none of my other bandmates expressed those opinions (which i tried to make open for any interpretation in the first place, but failing to do so, supposedly raised some eyebrows). i only heard the ghost of a reference to the mentioned livejournal, and that's all. everything else was mine...  all mine!   i'm puzzled though, because i can't find any trace of the tension my post sparked. was it in the buzz night egroups? if so, i'm sorry i missed it (since i'm not a member) and so i don't really know how to answer the people i've offended. all i can do is apologize for reacting while uninformed on the whole of the matter. i hope this is enough, but if it isn't, i'll just have to accept that, won't i?  you all must think i'm such a dolt. well, perhaps you may be on to something there... ;)  but, please... i implore you to give crap where crap is due and not pour it out on people who are innocent. thank you.  p.s. now i know why i can't find a trace. the internet explorer i'm using refuses to refresh and so i can't see it. well. i've said my piece anyway.

      (for the lack of a better title)  Oh shit. I actually forgot about my gig on that date. Shit shit shit. I'll check if there's another sked for the play. Anyway, the play is only for an hour and a half (no intermission). The problem is, CCP is so damn far from the gig venue. I'll check again with the Matilda girls... just in case the gig gets cancelled or something.   Oo nga naman, ano nga ba ang mas ok? Pentavia Jeans and Shirts or Pentavia Lighter Fluid?  Hi Vlad! See you at the gigs. ;)

      My sister Edwina approached me the other night and told me what happened to her when she went to her best friend Aryan's house.  Aryan is the younger sister of Pentavia vocalist Vlad. (Hmmm… if our younger sisters are best friends, does this mean that Candyaudioline and Pentavia are best friends, too? ;D)  V:  Wina, Wina… anong mas gusto mo?  Pentavia Jeans and Shirts or Pentavia Lighter Fluid? (knowing look) E:  (confusion and then flash of mind-shattering realization) ha? Aaaahhhhhhh… hahahahahaha! Hehehe…  (later)  E:   Aryan, nagalit ba yung kuya mo dun? A:  Ah… ewan! Hindi naman ata.  Si Michelle (girlfriend of Pentavia guitarist) ata baka nagalit… E:  Hehehehe…  *  As the first reel completes mixing, we are become more optimistic about releasing the album. We are reconsidering some songs for the second reel, hoping to fix them with some remixing or partial rerecording.  However, as we are nearing bankruptcy (hehehe), don't expect the album to be released in the immediate future because we still have to gather more funds. Hopefully, by March, it'll be out.  This week, we have no gigs because Ralph is pretty busy with his projects at work.  Come February, we'll be more active as a band, starting off with a February 11 gig at the UP Fair with Backbeat Bands.  I think there was supposed to be a February 6 but I think Ayn will be sessioning for Matilda that night.  If you want to catch her as Matilda's sub-bassist, go to any MWF Matilda gig.  Or maybe hindi pala gig yung meron si Ayn. I think she'll be watching a play pala...  *  "Candyaudioline Feminine Wipes------ we will wipe your femininity away!"

      Check this out:    Candyaudioline  Mail Order Monster Buy this LP  1998 4 stars   At Candyaudioline's most inspired, you think your stereo is going to spontaneously combust. "Coming Down" shows off their raw, majestic stomp. Their lyrics about the heartland of America ("I See You Found The Chips") and the movie Tron ("Realm of Impossibility") reach a new level of gloomy and post-rock power hooks.   It's their most powerful outing in quite a while. They are a band as much Black Sabbath-inspired as they are exhilarating. Mail Order Monster remains a quietly assured album, packed with amazing sounds. This music is muddily-produced and sizzling. The strength of this album is its ferocious sonic assault.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our readers respond  Dear Robot,  Glad to see Candyaudioline finally getting some well-deserved praise. I listen to Mail Order Monster every day. Keep up the good work.  -- Candyaudioline fan   What do you think?  ----------  For Robert and Ian:    Wagpokoya  Use Your Illusion Buy this LP  1989 1/2 Stars   Whether singing about confused women ("My Mind's Got a Mind of its Own") or the bar where they used to shoot pool ("I'm With Stupid"), the band takes being disposable to the extreme. When I was in high school, everyone I knew listened to Wagpokoya.  "You Are The Love (My Friend)" illustrates the culpability of those who fight to destroy humanity.   Call it a tragical history tour. Most of the time, Wagpokoya can't shake its reputation for being undeniable.   Wagpokoya's attempt to broaden their sound -- even integrating Serbian war hymns with the swagger of the Velvet Underground-esque "The Lost Art Of Keeping A Secret" -- isn't entirely an artistic success. No surprises here. Wagpokoya has been coasting on their reputation for shameless tunelessness for too long. It's not about a salary; it's all about reality.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Our readers respond  Dear Robot,  Your review of Wagpokoya was dead wrong. Sometimes you just have to enjoy a good rock album for what it is. Use Your Illusion is the record of the year. Your magazine sucks.   Wagpokoya forever,  -- Wagpokoya fan

      we played at millennia last night to front for The Youth. Allan played our recently mixed recordings and they sounded good. we played an 8-song set and i was really impressed at how amazing millennia's sound system had become. it was great! i was able to sing in a relaxed manner and everything was so loud. ralph had a problem with the amp and his gadget, though, and he grumbled about it. but all in all, it was cool.  we headed on to buzz night. although allan had entrusted the flow to someone who was already there, they still hadn't started by 11:30! he was kind of pissed so he made us go first. it was ok. i was more relaxed than usual because millennia had been so cool. fours songs lang kasi maraming banda tapos late na.  anyway, it was a success as gigs go :) the real fun was meeting some interesting people and hanging out with old friends (speaking of old friends, charles had a  superb  birthday party last wednesday. see ayn's blog for details, if you can find it).  2 songs to go for mixing.

        You're a Post-Punk. You know 70s punk was cool, but it was mostly just a stepping stone for the greater intellectualism of what would come after. The 80s were amazing. You quite possibly have huge hair, and may wear lots of black. Snare drums need reverb. Lots and lots of reverb.    urlLink   You Know Yer Indie.

      Allan scheduled a practice for us last night at Alberto's along with Soft Pillow Kisses.  His aim was to practice Erap of The Youth as a sub drummer and Charles as sub lead guitar for candyaudioline. Unfortunately, Erap couldn't make it at the last minute, and Lara couldn't come either so SPK had the same problem. We were all kind of lazy when we got to the studio and almost decided to nix practice altogether; we were planning to have a dvd fix at Charles's house instead.  But of course, me being the goody-two-shoes, I suggested we practice even for a short while because John Paul, having class the next day, was planning not to come along for the movie marathon and I was sorry to see his efforts at attending practice go to waste.  Then Mang Jun came out and he was all solicitous and friendly about having the studio ready for us… so we kind of didn't have a choice anymore, did we?  It was fun, though. We practiced as candyaudioline with John Paul as drummer and Charles as lead for three songs: My Silver Chair, An Empty You and Flaming Walls.  It took a few tries, but Charles has almost got the guitars for those songs down pat, which was pretty impressive for one practice.  Ditto for John Paul.  Afterwards, they practiced as SPK (Luie was there, too) sans Lara.  Allan was (half) joking that they sounded clearer without the bass, but John Paul said they sounded corny.  We sat around for a while outside before heading to Pares.  I tentatively approached Allan about alternatives to releasing the songs we had mixed so far as intended (secret na lang kung ano yung mga proposal na yun).  As I've said, I'm not too comfortable with my vocal performance. He told me I was being praning and he tried to assure me that, so far, the way those songs were mixed still fit into his grand design for the album.  Throughout the night (because I was being so apprehensive), he kept reassuring me that one of the reasons I could detect these faults was because I had been so used to singing in a certain way and anything different kills my ears (you'll hear what we've done with some songs when the album comes out); also, I can detect them because I'm the one who's singing and I know better.  He told me everything was cool so far. Okay. I guess I just need to grow into those songs a little more. Maybe 50 more listens will do the trick hehe. Seriously, I'm still apprehensive, but I also understand that I have to trust Allan's opinion because he knows what we're doing, and that comforts me kahit papaano.  ANYWAY… we had fun eating at Pares because Charles and Allan were goofing off again; add Ayn's comments to that mix and you really have a laugh fest.  For some reason, our conversation turned to the subject of penises, specifically, peeing habits of guys (and girls, too, I guess… I mean, they were comparing and contrasting!).  It was so vulgar but unbelievably hilarious--- thank heavens the people at that Pares place are so used to us that they didn't kick us out.  Apple (former SPK vocalist, before Eloha, I think) arrived later that night with her boylet (sorry, names don't stick with me at first introduction!); she wanted to go someplace and drink.  Ayn's parents picked her up first because she needed to go home already, and they brought Tristania with them.  She was so cute, pointing at the lights of Pier One in Tomas Morato and saying , "Light!"  So we drank (they had to force me first… I was worried about my voice) and caught up. It was fun to see Apple again and I'm glad she's… ahem… found relative happiness (I say "relative" because it's just starting out). I hope it evolves into something really good for her.  We all went home at around 4 am.  Four more songs to record and then we're all mixing.  We've spent a fortune already, but what the hey. Next Pink Noise session will probably be on Wednesday morning.

      we mixed "all smiles/can't sleep" and lapa last night. they sound pretty good (although i'm much too paranoid about my voice... the rest of them rocked, though, i promise!!! :D). we're making headway. still a lot of stuff to lay-in for saturday, but results have made us optimistic.  pahingi ng pera.  hehehe.  Buzz Night is on the 24th! Mayric's, 10 pm. We're playing.  We're also playing at the UP Fair on February 11, UP Sunken Garden.  A lot of Backbeat Bands will be there so if you're interested, your 70 bucks will probably take you a long way. Also playing are Softpillowkisses and Popular Days.  "Popular Days Beach Resort--- where all your days are populahhrrrr."

      for posterity's sake, uulitin ko yung sinabi ni allan sa tagboard (kasi baka mawala yung tagboard eventually).  sad inside and don't go away have been mixed. tonight, mixing of all smiles/can't sleep and additional lay-ins for songs from the first reel (guitars of allan and ralph and vocals of allan and selena).  HOPEFULLY, our time will be used wisely tonight.  thanks to all those who wish us the best for our recording, especially to Jovy who cared to say so in our egroups.

      I arrived late last night... Why? I'm not telling ;)  Anyway, I would just like to comment that Southwestern Style is the best--- way better than Pentavia wafer sticks. Everybody's been saying that "La Pa" turned out to be a really good song (because of the added affects).   Jeff is a god, according to Ralph. Well, I guess he really is one.  Nothing much happened when I got to the studio. Charles and I just enjoyed the sound of Allan's snores echoing inside the booth while Ralph was busy laying in some tracks for the lead parts. Hmmm... what else? Selena?  Pass a load!!!!!!!

      "Einstein Chakras Drugstore---- lahat ng gamot garantisadong sabog kahhh! Open 26 hours a day... except night time!"  "______ Condoms--- comes in only one size: small!" (Fill in the blanks with your favorite indie Filipino band hehehe)  "Skies of Ember Cornflakes----- sarrraaaaaaaaaap!"  we wasted around 2 and a half hours on the drums for "All Smiles/Can't Sleep" and "Felt So Fine".  We could practically feel our hard-earned money clinking through our fingers peso by peso. sigh...  on a lighter note, once the drums were finished for all songs, progress went smoothly for bass and allan vocals lay-ins... hopefully, this will continue for the remaining sessions. also, we were able to add one song to our list because of extra reel space... only we might end up junking it, depending on our budget. sigh...  could not sing well for "Felt So Fine" last night because I was dead tired. 2 am is not a good time for vocal chords to be trying to reach really high notes.  well, we're learning more each day.  p.s. that song Allan made me listen to yesterday was not by Adorable, and I never said it was; mentioned them for comparison. Anyway, I think it was by.... oh never mind, I might actually be wrong this time.

      everyone acted like they weren't themselves. people who were expected to arrive late came early and vice versa. this caused people to be a little jittery at first. stumbled over the first few takes of "Discarded Toy". however, we started warming up to the feel of recording and we were soon being our goofy selves again. charles took some pics with my camera.  side comment: putcha, ralph, may blog ka pala! i-update mo nga! i like the title hehehe... atsaka buking ka na sa musical tastes mo dahil sa archive hehe. "noebahdee cahres for meeh..."   we finished around 7 lay-ins plus recorded the drums for those songs and completed the bass for two of them. we shall continue again tonight. i'm kind of excited. this time, though, the session has been scheduled an hour later than originally reserved to give leeway for unforeseen setbacks such as last night's fiasco.  on the trip home, allan was playing around with band names, making them into products. ayn and i kept cracking up. my favorite is "Popular Days Soy Sauce".  And also "Five Wounds to Enter Cheese Snacks--- comes in only one flavor!" And then there was "Pentaviaaaah Lighter Fluid---- Fire from HELL!". Hmm... actually, that last one was this morning when allan called me up at work. Last night, it was "Pentavia Jeans and Shirts--- we will rock your balls away!" this isn't meant as poking fun at the bands themselves, of course... it just sounds really funny when Allan does the voice overs. tawa kami ng tawa ni Ayn.  this morning, ayn and i were the last ones to go home at 5 am--- and both of us had class/ work at around 9! as a result, i had a really bad nightmare about recording.  in it, it was 4 am and still going. allan was so delighted with the progress we were making that he kept us going and going and going... till it was 8:30 and we were all so tired! i was thinking, "NO, ALLAN, NOOOOOOOOO!" yun pala panaginip lang hehehe.  anyway, tumawag si Allan nga sakin kaninang umaga para pag-usapan yung "Light A Candle". He was suggesting ways for me to sing it. i wasn't sure if I could do it the way he wanted me to, which was kind of drunk-british accent-y... like the way Adorable does it (sorry, can't remember the name of the artist of that song he made me listen to as a sample). we still have to iron out little details like that tonight and for the following recording sessions.  anyway, i'm sure we'll have a lot more stories to tell about recording adventures. tatah.

      Tomorrow is the big day. Rather, it's the big night.  We shall begin recording the album; we've chosen 12 songs, some of them candy gig staples, others, previously unrecorded, still others, really old songs that require new versions. I saw Allan and Roel last night and both of them told me they were excited, although also a little pressured.  We hope everything turns out well. Soon, our efforts will bear fruit…  By the way, Allan tells me that Discarded Toy is top 88 on the soundclick.com charts. That's weird. I don't know how exactly they decide on that, though, or if it really matters...  If it does matter, thanks to those who thought of doing that or who made it possible. hehe...

      SO… you think candyaudioline is dead, huh? No fricking way.  We have not been blogging for the past two weeks because of unavoidable circumstances.  My computer at home fucked up. Allan's keyboard is a fuck-up.  Ralph is sick all the time, and not just in the head.  Ayn has been… er… busy.  Roel's religion forbids him to have anything to do with technological progress.  Oh yes… there were many attempts to blog during vacation but blogger always has these little surprises for people who type their entries online--- poof! Your words have magically disappeared.  But here  we  are. We're back.  Let's see… so we DID talk about that comeback gig at the Backbeat Christmas Party.  That was a superb gig.  So was the Eastwood gig with Moonstar 88 the next day.  Ayn had brought Tristania, who showed beginnings of being a night person as well. While other kids were approaching the stage during our set with their hands covering their ears and their faces contorted in disgust, she was sitting in the front row with her yaya staring up at us and probably wondering what her mom, her ninang, her 2 ninongs, and her tito/a were doing there making that (wonderful) racket.  She stayed awake through the whole set, too, and when Ayn came down from the stage she smiled widely at her and asked to be carried. Hah!  She's a lot tougher than those wimpy 5 year olds were.  People gave us kudos for that performance, mainly because we're a lot tighter now, and also because they probably didn't expect us to gel so well with all the problems we'd been having the past weeks. Anyway, we're all a happy family again. Nag-group hug pa nga kami ni Roel at ni Allan eh.  That happened at the December 27 Winston Music Blast.  Roel and Allan were there for Moonstar, The Youth and Parokya.  We were sitting backstage and Roel was a little buzzed so he started bringing up the reasons he quit.  Allan was just nodding his head… it was kind of a blur but Roel was telling Allan basically that he was such a hot-tempered jackass hehehe.  Anyway, Roel said he was wrong for quitting the band; he said on principle he should have quit work.  So we were just laughing that he had to bring it up and I just said, "Aww, group hug, group hug!!" and, like weirdos, we hugged.  Ayn and Ralph should have seen that (heck--- YOU, dear Reader, should have).  Christmas Eve was spent separately, with our respective friends and families.  As you know, Allan, Charles and I spent Christmas evening at Ayn's with a DVD marathon.  For the New Year celebration, Ralph, Allan and I spent it at Allan's house (Ralph was all alone with Charmaine off to gensan for her sibling's wedding).  Roel was in Baguio.  Ayn was with her family-- she was kinda pissed we didn't ask her to come with us, but we were thinking it was important for her to spend it with Tristia and her family.  Anyway, the three of us didn't do much.  We ate dinner and then Ralph watched "So Close" on the DVD while Allan and I dozed in our seats.  I woke up at around 11:30 when Ralph switched to the local countdown specials.  At 11:55 pm, Salbakuta performed on channel 7 so we woke Allan up.  He looked at it and then went back to sleep.  Afterwards he told us he didn't appreciate the fact that he ushered in the New Year with Salbakuta on the brain hehehe.  Anyway, we barely woke him up in time for the actual New Year, but we all had our coins jingling at the right moment and we greeted each other and---- well, that was it.  I fell asleep again while Ralph and Allan tinkered with Soundclick and more DVDs.  In the morning, we had breakfast and watched "The Pianist", which was kind of depressing, but a good movie, too.  Allan fell asleep and Ralph and I decided to head home at 11 am.  Friday, we met with him again and also Charles at Megamall.  We had a slow dinner at Pizza Hut and then they looked around for more DVDs.  Ack! DVD fever!  Ayn invited us over to her house for some baked tahong.  We stopped to eat some tahong and liempo, and then we headed to Jeff Soapdish's house nearby for his birthday celebration.  Acel and Popo of Moonstar were there, Jephoy too… and some of Jeff's friends from Soapdish and other bands.  He had a lot of booze flowing, which Ayn and I enjoyed, and Jeff was very solicitous to his guests, bringing them food and drink all the time.  They tried to have an acoustic set up, but after Jeff's first song of "High and Dry" by Radiohead (hi, thom ;*), it started drizzling.  That sucked… but we still had fun. It was nice of him to ask us over.  We have great news.  We are going to be recording an album of 12 songs this week.  Finally, we are going to have some concrete output here.  As allan says, it's long overdue for the band.  Well, here we are.  Yesterday afternoon, we practiced the songs we'll be recording.  We're hoping to accomplish it in a few days so we could save money.  This is it, candyaudioline fans--- our second album! Yipee.  Last night, Roel told us that Tiffany was looking for bands for Millennia.  We were off to have dinner so Roel said he'd meet us there, if ever.  Sabi niya, "Sige, tugtog tayo! I-text niyo si Tepani kung pano!"  Panalo ka talaga, dude. Candyaudioline forever.  p.s.  we did play last night.  Someone lent us a cable for Ayn's bass--- thank you! It was great, although weird na naman yung sound system ng konti, pero matinutino na rin compared to before.  Ang sarap kasi ang lakas at ang kapal na naman ng tunog kagabi. Sigh.  Happy New Year, candybloggers!

      It's such a delight to be compiling the first year's entries of the candyblog.  For one thing, there are numerous laughs to be had over all the situations we've been in since February 2003.  Also, the candyblog is part of our history, and we all know that we can learn a thing or two from it.  The first entries give general information about the band.  Some give views of our lives outside of candyaudioline. I know now why some people have come to dislike us, for instance… a post full of blunt observations written innocently could easily have been taken as a malicious jibe.  There is a sprinkling of these posts throughout the year, but we can do nothing to change that.  The nature of electronic text is that it can be deleted after retrospection, but the impact of it will already have been made on hundreds of people who have viewed it.  This lesson, we have also had to learn in a recent situation.  Well, at least we've learned. But I think the main lesson for me is that someone somewhere will always be offended at what any one person says on the Net.  I've been reading my very old posts in this blog and I can't help smiling at the funny scrapes they bring back--- this has largely been due to my detailed, if a little OC, writing style.  If I hadn't written all those things, the recall wouldn't be as effective.  Ayn has written many posts in this way, too, perhaps in an even more detailed manner.  If she hadn't done so, I wouldn't have been able to experience how candyaudioline fared during the month of May (when I was in Bukidnon) or how the first Nymphetz Experience went (I wasn't able to join them that time).  Some word choices or selected details in our posts have probably irked some people, but this was never intentional.  I think that, in the end, this is what matters.  I've noticed that my recent posts have become blah… I don't know, I guess I've been reluctant to expose my thoughts since… well, I'll be honest… The Blog Fiasco (hehe). But sticking to the facts is just plain boring.  This blog used to be so much fun--- it was the band's message board where we'd poke fun at each other or invite each other out for a movie (or to Nymphetz!).  We used to assume that no one ever read this blog, and that gave us the freedom to say anything we wanted and we could be the crazy weirdos we really were.  Now, though, we realize that some people actually do read this blog and so we have to be a little more responsible about what we say.  But I think that we've taken this consciousness a little too far in the past months.  This is candyaudioline's blog, and we promised to faithfully document all our endeavors, be they seriously musical or nonsensical fun.  I have no intention of offending people, but from now on, I think I'll be more honest with myself when it comes to posting. I am the fricking Supreme Blog Mistress, godammit! Hehehehe…  By the way, check out our archives.  I promise that you'll enjoy them :)  *  Alam ko na kung saan kinuha ni Roel yung "American standard" hehehe. Di ba brand yun ng bathroom fixtures???

      Ayn and I met up yesterday early evening so I could give her the bass, which she needs for a Matilda gig this week.  She suggested an impromptu dinner at Ababu.  Over ox brain, we had a nice talk about Buzz Night, Superminty, candyaudioline and the DIY-"indie" dilemma, a topic which was resurrected mainly because JM had interviewed Allan for his thesis again the night before.  Basically, we were just catching up on each other.  We both miss playing as candyaudioline and hope Ralph would have a freer schedule soon.  She said she was meeting up with Charms later that night to watch an independent film where Matilda's music was used for the soundtrack. Told her I was heading off to Pink Noise for Superminty mixing with Charles.  The big baby didn't want to be there alone with Jeff sound engineer (Allan had a PUP gig with Moonstar and Parokya) and so he insisted I come along.  I arrived at Pink Noise to discover luie was with him.  Tsk, tsk, tsk. Pero ok lang kasi I really wanted to be there during mixing anyway. Jeff was feeling really sleepy and he looked like he wasn't in the mood. He made a valiant effort at mixing though, even if it took him slightly longer this time (two and a half hours!).  He was only able to mix "Bitter Art" before admitting that he couldn't stay awake anymore.  The song sounded great.  We burned Allan a copy and decided to go home.  While Jeff was mixing that song, Ayn arrived with Charms and another friend in tow--- they had missed the film showing and decided to crash our mixing party :)  Ayn gave me a ride home and that was that.  I feel positive about the Superminty EP because it sounds good so far.  I'm sure that when we finish the candy recording, it will give the same satisfaction.

      hello everyone!!!  ever wondered why some things never really change? well, i do and it really frustrates me but what can i do?   last nght was buzz night but i never really got to experience it that much because i got there very late na (i had work coming from sta rosa in the afternoon then on to san mateo in the evening, good thing selena was with me the whole time - valentines eh!) i even forgot the name of the band that was performing when we arrived. they play really decent alternative rock tunes and even sang some tagalog songs! (PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT RECENTLY I'VE COME TO REALIZE THAT BUZZ NIGHT IS JUST AN EVENT AND NOT "THE INDIE SCENE" ITSELF WHICH GIVES ME THE FREEDOM TO INVOLVE BANDS OF WHATEVER GENRE I DEEM APPROPRIATE)... OH WELL... it was really nice seeing familiar faces that night still suporting buzz eventhough they weren't billed to play that night. i saw Dott and some of his bandmates, my ex-aspirin/minty bandmate jeoffrey (probably checking on what has become of minty hehehe... ang lupit namin kagabi ano? mamatay ka nalang sa inggit!!!). i also saw some members of the Lubitels.   i had wally of ballon derby to fill in for me doing the organizing stuff while i was away. salamat chong for the help pero huwag mo na pangarapin yung pinapangarap mo kagabi (over my dead body) ako ang buzz night! pag ikaw na ang mag-take over sa buzz night, iba nalang ang itawag mo. "derby night" sabay may sabong... joke lang pare...     to the bands who played, salamat! carnival park, balloon derby, tether, five leaves left (d ako sure sa name sensha na), archaster, jello torpedo (featuring my much-missed, well-loved friend and recently adopted anak Patty on bass. metal nga ba?), syempre ang walang kakupas-kupas na popular days (these guys are really great... i'm not saying this because close friends ko sila... d ako ganun eh) sana may mag-comment sa superminty. alangan naman sabihin kong ang galing-galing SOBRA ng set namin except for the last song na d pa talaga namin na-peperfect, pangit din naman sabihin kong ubod ng ganda mga song namin kahit totoo... hay naku, life is so unfair. naaawa tuloy ako sa mga taong d nakapanuod sa amin...  ganyan talaga...  ano? egocentric ako? megalomaniac? self-worshipping? hindi ah... i'm simply just being honest...  ___________  oo nga pala...  delayed pa rin ang 14 song candyaudioline recording with still 3 songs under construction...  nagrecord na nga pala ang Superminty ng 4 song ep waiting to be mixed... ABANGAN!!!  soft pillow kisses might record a 4 song ep by the second week of march... song to be considered for inclusion are... "wasting opportunities", "special day", "bathing in the sun" and "i was right".  i've also been talking to my aspirin bandmates and have agreed to record an 8 song mini-lp...  a compilation is also in the planning stage...  ayos d ba!!!

      We played Portia Sorority night at the UP Fair; they had commissioned all the Backbeat Bands to play that night and we got included as a bonus. Before this date, we had been worried because we couldn't contact Ralph and weren't sure whether he'd be able to make it.  Thankfully, he arrived at around 8 pm along with Charmaine, whom we hadn't seen in a long time.  The show was an hour late, but by the time they started, things were running smoothly.  There were some stressful moments on the part of Backbeat management due to bands who hadn't arrived at their respective call times wanting to still perform.  Surprisingly, I wasn't nervous that night, probably because I had already been backstage the 2 previous nights and also because I learned from last year's situation. Ayn and I were really anxious last year, always conscious that classmates or acquaintances would see us.  After the performance, which went fairly well, we felt like, "That was IT?" hahaha! Anyway, I felt relaxed before, during and after the performance, which was a first! The only thing that probably gave me nerves was the fact that I was dying to pee right before our set ;) what a horrible feeling.  Onstage, we couldn't really tell… we sounded ordinary, which isn't really a good thing… so we were thinking, "Ok, not a stupendous set, but we're getting through this fine."  It was fun, though, and I actually spoke a little, even if it was only to say happy birthday to my friends and to say which bands were coming next.  Then we made way for the next band.  Some people complimented us on our performance and we thanked them.  Allan was still stressed about work so he may have seemed curt to these people at first. We appreciated their comments and were surprised that our set turned out well, after all.  We listened to it afterwards on John Paul's camcorder.  We had to wait until Parokya ni Edgar finished before we could leave.  Then we went to Pares :D Damn, I can't remember all the funny stuff that happened anymore… got sick yesterday and wasn't able to jot this all down immediately.  It was just great to be with everyone again: Ayn was with us at Pares, Ralph is still alive, Roel was there (even if binitin niya kami sa "My Silver Chair" hehehe)… even Charmaine showed up.  It was a good reunion.  Buzz Night is this Saturday! I think Carnival Park is supposed to play, too… I forgot to put them in last entry's list. Anyway, just be there and see for yourself :)

      sorry. we won't be able to play at "Against Perfection" at Millennia tonight (punta pa rin kayo, though) because Ralph has retreated into his shell again and we can't find him. Also, Allan has two gigs to work tonight, Roel has one. Oh well. We can't play at Buzz Night either because Ralph hasn't confirmed it yet... mukhang hindi pa siya puwede. However, the UP Fair gig this Wednesday is good to go because Ralph wouldn't miss that for the world (hehehe, iba na kasi pag peer audience). if you're going to catch us at the UP Fair, tickets are P80 each and come around 10-11 pm.  Here are the bands for this month's Buzz Night:  Buzz Night, Februrary 14, 2004 Mayric's @ 10 pm  Archaster Jello Torpedo Superminty Eggboy Tether Playfulminds Balloon Derby  Oh shit, i think i forgot someone. i'll just get back to you guys on this, hehehe. i think this is it, though.  anyway, see you at the fair!

      the recording sessions are almost done save for 3 more songs. one to be re-recorded the two others either remixed or re-do the vocals and then remixed... that's what my bandmates think but personally i find 2 more songs a bit uncomfortable which poses a dillemna as to either bring the songs from 14 to 12 or to release a ten song album and put the other four songs to the reserve list... if you were in my shoes what would you do...   taking into consideration that the cost for recording has reached really un-imaginable heights, it seems that it would be hard for us to finish the recording in the nearest possible time... also i've not been having luck with bookings for studio time because for one, my sched at work does not allow me and second, our engineer is very much in demand these past few weeks... to make a long story short, EXPECT DELAY !!! hopefully it won't take long... also ralph's been out of it lately because of the demands of his work...   maybe it's not yet time for candyaudioline to put out an album... at least we've got a very neat title for it... it's called "saved it for torture reference"...    torture it is...

      i'm sure everyone has noticed that we haven't been mentioning roel much when it comes to matters of the blog or the e-groups. well, he doesn't go online, really, and he'd rather leave the documenting to us (which i'm not so sure was a wise decision hehehe, then again...). i tried to make him a member of the blog team before but he let 3 months go by without accepting the invitation so i took him out. we do update him from time to time by printing stuff out for him though, and of course he hears news from his friends, too. recently, he's been telling allan that he's planning to buy a computer (roel, priorities mo, ha!) so he may eventually be playing a bigger role online with candy in the future. we'll see.  anyway, roel's still the same these days, for anyone who wants to know. he's still the candy drummer,  of course . syempre, happy kami na bumalik siya, kahit papano. sana one day makapagpost na rin siya dito.  we may be playing on friday at amoranto stadium but that depends on ralph because he's still swamped with work. ralph, if you have time, give us a shout!

      yesterday was really weird for me health-wise... i woke up feeling 100% rested but for some unknown reason got really sick an hour after... i remember feeling very cold and chilly, then i suddenly started coughing which really hurt because it was a dry phlegm-less coughing... i decided not to go to work to rest... i tried to sleep but couldn't. so there i was lying on the sofa waiting for myself to get better. what i did was talked with some friends on the phone and also called up some of my work related acquaintances... after 2 hours of doing so, i suddenly felt that i was fully recovered. it was a bit weird for me because by that time a doctor arrived at our house to check on my younger brother who was having these really bad coughs. i took time to have a check-up and guess what, i'm a very healthy person! fuck! for someone who appears to be 2 times overweight, my bp was 120/80... weird? after the doctor left, i was so sure that i was in good condition so i decided to confirm a practice session with one of my bands, but one of them suddenly couldn't make it because of commitments so i decided to call it off. just as i was doing so, i began to feel a twitching pain under my lower left rib and another just at the left side of my upper chest near the arm pit. weird weird weird. feeling ko tuloy may kumukulam sa akin...

      salamat naman at nakapagpost ka after the longest time, allan. i guess people have begun to think all of candyaudioline thinks like me because i've been the only one posting here and i look like the official spokeperson. well, all i've been trying to do these past months is document all our experiences... i can't help it if they're filtered through my perceptions, faulty or otherwise. at least, i've finally put up a disclaimer (that may not be much help, but it's worth a try), and i hope you, ayn and ralph could start posting more often so that we could get different views on what makes candyaudioline go.  on to some news: we're about 85% finished with the album. allan's still deciding on whether to rerecord my vocals for "something wrong" but that depends on the mix... we might redo "don't go away"... hmmm.... medyo malabo nga yung mga plano namin eh hehe. we might redo the whole of "felt so fine" as well, and, so that studio time isn't wasted, Superminty might jump in and record a few songs, too. it all seems very flighty, but circumstances change so quickly and we have to be on our toes all the time.  upcoming gigs are:  feb 11 UP Fair, UP Sunken Garden. we're playing at around 10 or 10:30 pm.  feb 14 Buzz Night. some of the newbies who weren't able to make it last time, like Tether, will be there (hopefully), as well as some of the regulars.  ok, that's all, for now.

      this is a review from "indiepages.com" of a recently released local independent compilation showcasing some of what this country has to offer...     V/A - "Dashboard Teddy Version 1.0" cd (Dorothy)  This is a fun comp CD from this small label fom the Philippines. Many of the bands come from the Philippines, including Soft Pillow Kisses, Happy Showers, Spring Boutique, Fantasy Lights, and Sodajerk, though there are a handful of groups from around the world, like Simpatico (Australia), Bobsy (Singapore), River (France), and Laura Watling, Evening Lights, Lil' Hospital & Suretoss (USA). The songs on here are all basically indiepop, both of the jangly and the dreamy variety. I think that most of the songs are exclusive to this release; (though most of the non-Filipino bands' tracks are not, except for Laura Watling & Suretoss, the latter being a cover of the Verlaines' "Death & The Maiden"), and a damn lot of them are quite good. Lots of new bands to be introduced to here, and I was especially impressed by Soft Pillow Kisses (and their terrific Rocketship-ish tune), the dreamy Sonnet LVIII, the TFC-ish Sodajerk, and the very jangly Fantasy Lights. Overall, an excellent sampler of indiepop from the Philippines and beyond!   MTQ=14/18   -- Listen to "Candybar" --

      i posted this as a comment on dino's livejournal:  HI PEEPS, ako nga pala si allan montero tubong manila at taga CANDYAUDIOLINE, nag iisa palang sa buhay pero may kinakasama. tao lang. nag enjoy ako sa mga nabasa ko. at in a way, na hurt din. not only for my own self but also for my bandmates. i was able to read their entries (including blog ng candy, blog ni ayn, at lj ni dino) as dino suggested narin when we talked kahapon. wala naman akong makitang sobrang dapat ika baliktad ng mga underwear niyo. maliban lang sa pinost ni ayn regarding the "character choo choo". i talked with ayn about that and she had a valid reason naman. siguro sa inyo hindi pero wala na akong magagawa dun. sayang matalino pa naman kayo. pwera lang si jef. she posted something sa blog namin which i think very well states her side, na kung babasahin niyo ng may malinaw na isipan at gabay mula sa espiritu santo ay maliliwanagan kayo. amen.  ayoko na sanang mag-react kasi ayoko ng ganito, pero...  TO DINO: kala ko ba malinaw na yung usapan natin kahapon? hindi ako nakaluhod, nakahiga ako, kung ako yung tinutukoy mo dito ["it's like in the old ages and by old ages i mean that scene in braveheart (sorry i just watched it eh), when william wallace (gibson) came back to his village and was challenged to a duel by that BIG GUY. BIG GUY threw this big rock at william wallace but failed but when it was wallace's turn he just threw a small pebble and BIG GUY was on his knees."]   ["9. Allan calls me up. Because I gave him my word I won't talk about the conversation in my journal."] ANO TONG MGA TO, dooD...  ----[Your friends are way too eager. (Mine were driven to tears and had to make phone calls)] ----["gusto mo marinig yung reaction ng kabila? "ed di bumuo sila ng sariling nilang eksena!" ]   ["di ko gets yun. pero ang gets nagmuka na silang tanga at alam ng lahat ng tao kung sino sila. di pa rin nila tanggap ang criticism"]------diba sinabi ko sayo kahapon na alam namin na mukha naman talagang tanga ang CANDYAUDIOLINE sa lahat. shoegaze metal ika nga diba. kahit kami nga tinitira namin sarili namin eh. i just want to  make it a point na hindi naman namin inasam na mag mukang number one. we're just friends who happen to be in the same band. siguro mabigat lang talaga ang dugo ng mga tao samin. san ka ba naman makakakita ng indie-indiehang banda na may bokalistang iyakin pero maganda (yeehee i lab you), may isa pang miyembrong mukang hip hop pero mahilig manlibre ng mga tinuturing niyang friends at hatak narin ng mga tinuturing niyang friends, bahistang nagpapaka anonymous according to you guys (eh hindi naman lj user na may username) at naka black at mayaman, lima sasakyan at may magandang anak na balang araw ay magiging diva,  gitaristang ang impluwensya ay gitarista ng suave band pero kamuka ang bahista ng gorillaz, drummer na pwedeng tumakbong presidente ng pilipinas dahil sobrang dami niyang prends pero tingin sa kanya ng mga friends niya pet sya.   ["i love playing this flame war game. it's just a game. it doesn't really matter who wins or who loses, just pure unadulterated real time online entertainment."] --- i hope you really mean what you're saying.   TO JEF: hindi na kita paaabutin sa korte. ngayon alam na naming lahat ang ugali mo. di bale, pwede ka pa namang makikain at magpalibre at humingi ng pera sakin.  TO ZJ: bakit ano ang nagawa ko sayo? mas kampi pa naman ako sayo kesa kay.... kala ko ba friends tayo? bakit mo naman kami tinawag na insecurity guards? puede naman insecurity blankets or inSECURITY bank. kras pa naman kita nun. idol ka pa naman ni ayn. kaya nga sya nag bass eh. buti pa si mel nag hi sakin. ikaw may pa irap irap ka pa. buti hindi pinasok ng lamok yung ilong mo. joke. pasensya na at hindi ko alam na apektado pala kayo dun sa pagbabago ko ng line up. honestly, i was trying to be fair to all. alam ni dino yan. an in-explain ko kay aj yan. nung mga unang tugtog niyo naman, lagi ko pinagbibigyan si dino kung anong gusto niya. yun lang time na yon ipit din ako. di bale sana prends parin tayo. hindi ko rin kasi gusto ang narda. pero friend ko yung singer because she is a good. naalala ko nga nung kelts cross ka pa dati...  TO MELANIE: sorry din sa line up. tanong niyo nalang kay dino kung ano yung real reason.   ["this cracked me up! yeah, i seem to remember there was only one band playing that night :)"] ----kailan? pati ba naman ikaw? aahhh, lubitels lang pala. playing to their friends. okay. klasik (pinoy tayo eh).  TO ARNI: ["the thing that i dont get is this.. let's say yung band nga na yun yung tinutukoy... kunwari yun nga yung sinasabihang pretentious kuno.. fine. why cant they take it then?'] ---please refer to deleted blog entry. didn't she say "you win some you lose some"? wasn't that acceptance of criticism that may or may not have been directed to us? kung di namin matanggap ang criticism dapat matagal na kaming nag disband.  ["not every night will be good, but if you had fun playing then thats good enough. not everyone will like lubitels, not everyone will like their band, not everyone will like each others bands, but what the fuck right? di pa nakakalabas ng pilipinas mga banda dito nasasaktan na sa mga comment na ni hindi naman sa kanila directed. kaya walang growth sa music dito.. puro gusto naririnig kapurihan. nagbanda pa!... and im generalising OK!!! pasalamat at walang mga NME, Uncut at Q magazine dito.. or taina maski mga DiS at pitchfork kung saan tinitira mga tugtugan... ewan ko na lang. baka maHURT masyado mga tao.. pepersonalin pa siguro.."]----sana nga you're generalizing. and also hope that you could help by organizing other events kasi i know may experience ka dyan. diba sa milenya you have your own event?  alam mo ba kung bakit walang growth sa music dito? ako hindi ko alam. basta alam ko na i'm doing my best to look for fresh new bands lalo na yung may potential para lang tirahin nila jef and company.  --your " UNKA PESTE " at oo tama ka hindi nga " vengeance " pangalan ng anak ni ayn as  you  posted sa  e-groups ng dating myx.     TO THE FRIENDS AND FANS OF THE LUBITELS: i also admire them naman (although i don't think that they take me as a friend anymore). i see them as one of the bright hopes for the scene kasi sobrang bihira ang may bagong banda na may sariling tunog agad. that's why i keep putting them up, asking dino kung kelan sila available.  TO THE PEOPLE CONCERNED: about my comment "bumuo na lang sila ng sarili nilang eksena", I really meant it when i said that to dino because there have been so many complaints about the way i've been handling buzz night. pasensya na, pero busy person talaga ako. although i really care for the scene, i think i can no longer satisfy the tastes and standards of its more discriminating members. it is more of surrendering na lang to people who think they can do better events that will cater to their tastes. I WILL STILL CONTINUE BUZZ NIGHT pa rin, but i won't promise it to be an all-out indie affair because, as i've said, halos wala nang bagong banda. everyone who wants to play at this event is welcome.  but then again, as someone said, "this night is not working for [you] anymore." since when?  sincerely yours, allan  ps. maglalabas nga pala ang CANDYAUDIOLINE ng album. sure na to. sana suportahan niyo kahit gamitin niyo lang siyang salamin pag nagsusuklay kayo. ang title ng album ay "SAVED IT FOR TORTURE REFERENCE." oh diba goth?  sige na. GOTH-om na ako. di bale sa birthday ko imbitado kayo. i've said my piece. now i will rest in peace. sagutin niyo nato hanggang gusto niyo at sana ikamatay niyo kasi huli nato. dapat kahapon sana eh pero may hindi sumunod sa usapan na walang lalabas sa pinag usapan namin. diba nakaka degrade naman yung malamang may iyakin pala sa isang death metal band? sorry kung naka offend ako kaya lang naka offend din kayo.   ["that buzz night dangerously lacks a lot of rock."]   ----sana nandun kayo nung november at december...wala kasi kayo eh... pwera kay jef. rock on.  ***  grabe ngayon ko lang uli nagawa 'to.

      I've been advised not to react and post anything anymore in relation to Selena's "excuse me, please" entry. However, after having done some thinking and after everybody has said their piece, I figured that it's fair enough that I post  my  own piece. Here goes..  "So what the hell is this about," you may ask. I say, it's about some people who can never accept "unsolicited criticisms" of some person's observation. It's a lesson for me and my band, for the most part actually:   1) Now we know that there are people who only welcome praises;  2) Now we know that some people do have a life---a life defined by the internet;  3) Now we know that some people get a kick out of jumping on someone who dare said something in opposition;  4) Now we know that some people can never get what an apology means. 5) Now we know  that contradicting someone is an equivalent of wanting to initiate a word war ; and lastly, 6) Now we know that it's possible for someone to "get off" through a pseudo word war on the net.  Pardon my ignorance about all this. I was being such an idiotic oaf that I really am (no wonder I didn't make it to the Cum Laude list in my university).  Oh yeah, some other allegations I want to dispell:  Many people said that I had "no right" to react to what was posted. The fact is, I do have the right. Everybody (at least in the free world) has the right to say what they want. It doesn't matter if their opinions are distasteful, hateful, or backed with stupidity. Nobody should be told to shut up because somebody else doesn't like what they're saying. Every human should have the right to their own opinion. (Or in my case, I had the right to pretend to hold whatever opinion I wanted...) Of course you already knew that. I just found it funny that these words had to come out from you and from your minions when I was the one who was hounded when I posted a comment. This is no skin off my back and you're free to do what you want. It's  merely  a point I disagree on.   I mean, take a look at this blog. There are so many entries here that "ragged" on so many bands and people. Many people have reacted to them-- some have even confronted me in person. But I never took their reactions against them. If I haven't written those things, they wouldn't have anything to react to in the first place. It seems to be a rather immature and selfish stance to be angry (oops, of course you weren't angry, you just have a bad temper) when someone attacks you, and then use a bigoted slur to try to insult them.  Tapos sablay naman .   Well, as an answer to that, I have seven things to say:  1)  I do not identify with any group  (ie, preppie, indie, punk, goth, etc.). You and your friends' attacks on goth were the ones that came out as hilarious--to the point of becoming ridiculous already. I'm not denying that I have "goth" friends and that I've supported the goth subculture in manila. I have my preferences that are similar to other people's preferences but they weren't and will never be based on a group of people. (if this is to be used to disprove an opponent's claims, maybe I should have said something like: "at least, I'm not the one who looks like one of 'em cast rejects from the Brady Bunch" or something to that effect);  2)  Within Temptation is definitely NOT my favorite band  ;) No offense to the fans of the band. I'd have to say though that I'm not ignorant about WT since I had to listen to them for a time when an ex-"pseudo" band had to do a cover of one of their songs and I do listen to almost everything anyway (ah, however, you prefer your own scenario so any further explanation would be pointless); now finally, something that has a connection to the topic--  3)  It's irrelevant to know which band I thought you "ragged" on . It could be us, it could be Weedisneys (which you later on admitted), it could be some band that defines "your bad taste in music," as you admirably had put it, and it could even be your own band. But as I said, it's irrelevant. We were caught guessing and didn't exactly assume on anything.  You did . If my memory serves me well, I never mentioned any band that I thought you were referring to. I played safe, just the way  you  played safe. However, I can't help but find it funny too that you and your friends all concluded that I was trying to defend my own band. But then again, if I were, am I not allowed to do so?;  4)  In relation to that , just in case some of your friends think that I have something against your band, I'd have to say that  it's the opposite actually . In fact, I was even all praises for your band when a friend asked me about it. I even introduced one of your bandmates to him, referring to her as a part of the band that I was telling him about. Ironically, some of your friends still felt the need to imply that it just isn't so. Oh well;  5)  "Shows more of your character than the band's"...  this is the line that really got you. You told my bandmate yourself. Why were you so affected? It's something rhetorical and need not be explicitly said anyway (although I did he he). Everybody's writings show more of their own character rather than what is being written about-- no matter how hard we try to deny it. And, it did show more of your character, just the same way that everything I've written and am now writing show more about  my  character. This also applies to your friends who seemed so eager, possessing such admirable enthusiasm, to ride on  their  "word war";  6)  At least you took it as a compliment , when I tagged you as "THE rock critic" --though taken a bit out of context and that's quite understandable :)You should feel flattered (and not just say that you are). Really; and lastly,  7)  No sweetie , I sincerely think that I/we have  nothing  to apologize for --not even for the "wrong things."  (Just the same that you don't have to apologize for anything --not even to Weedisneys-- even if we know very well that they're bound to find out about all of this in their own way. As you said, you were merely expressing an opinion.  And you're right . Alongside that, you always have your friends to run to and cheer you on-- this kinda reminds me of myself and my friends when we were still in first grade, but when we grew up, we finally knew better.)  So there.   Anyway...  The lesson here is that not everybody has a sense of irony.   There are a lot of lunatics on the internet out here, and they can say whatever they want without any ramifications. You should take everything you read, including stuff posted in chat rooms and e-groups, with a grain of salt.   Once again, you are free to hold your own opinions, but as long as you're unwilling to accept others, I fail to see how you will be able to attain respect for your own self.  So that's that. I hope this clears everything up. If all of this crap ends in this post, good for us all. If it doesn't, that's  no longer my problem . I've said my two cents worth on this. And I've had enough crap to deal with. I'm not one person to let my bad temper cramp my style, you know ;)  Have a great life!  If you still feel offended by what is said on this blog, then  urlLink e-mail me . Also, there's a tag-board to the right side of this blog, just in case you haven't noticed (I know it isn't all that great like having a guestbook or a comments page but that's all we can afford to have and we all --except for Ralph who's a genius as we already know-- are internet idiots who can't even tell HTML from URL as Ralph had once put it.)   There isn't  really much of a need for you to "make us post your entry here." Right? ;)   In the meantime....  bend over as I pucker up .   Love and slack and everything in between, Ayn Ruth Z.

      Last Friday, I went with Allan and Charles to a Moonstar88 gig somewhere in Alabang.  One of the Starstruck people, Jenilyn or whatever her name is, was supposed to perform.  When Charles entered the house where the artists were supposed to wait, the lady said, "Ay! Akala ko si Rainier!"  Later on, a little girl went up to him and said, "Rainier!" to which he hastily replied, "Hindi ako yun."  She then asked him whether Rainier was really going to come.  He said he didn't know.  Jenilyn performed her set.  While she was singing, Charles and Jepoy had to move around the stage behind her to set it for the band.  Someone from the crowd said, "Si Rainier, o!" and others shouted, "Starstruck!"  He immediately jumped off the stage to hide behind me and Allan.  The next day, we all went to Subic with The Youth, where they were to perform at Club Edge, "The only Rock Concert Hall in The Philippines!"  Again, people were whispering every time Charles walked past.  While The Youth was performing, Allan talked to the club's owner, who said his goal was to make Olongapo the Rock Capital of the Philippines again.  I asked Allan if it really was the Rock Capital of the Philippines once before and he said yes.  For some reason, bands in the late 70's and 80's used to love playing there.  Ooh, interesting.  Well, from what I overheard, Club Edge is one of the best places to perform live, so I hope it'll be able to reach its goal.  It's a nice venue and I hope candyaudioline gets to perform there in the future, which we were supposed to do last Saturday, except that we didn't have transportation. Sayang.  Anyway, we were about to leave and Charles was bringing the guitars out of the club when he "bumped" them on a girl by the bar (at least, that's what she said to him).  He said sorry (I think that was her excuse to talk to him) and she told him that he looked like Rainier of Starstruck.  Some of her friends started talking to him and they asked for his number and they took pics of him on their phones.  Charles was so embarrassed because some men at the next table were staring and whispering "Starstruck", but of course he didn't want to offend the girls.  And then, when we were approaching the van, some fans of The Youth who were taking their pictures looked at Charles when Robert said, "Si Rainier, o! Si Rainier!"  They laughed and proceeded to take pictures of him, too!  Poor Charles! Well, he can't help it if the guy dresses like him.  It's funny because Charles dressed like that way before F4 and Starstruck but when people see him now, they probably think that he copied his look from them.  Hmmm… that reminds me of something…  Hehehe.   Dream. Believe.  Eat.   Gutom na ako. Kakain muna ako ng Magic Flakes with chocolate cream filling.

      seriously, ralph, i mean it. he  does  resemble the track star a bit. it must be because his long, shiny hair makes him look feminine, though--- if roel was clean cut, he probably wouldn't look like her that much.   haha. buking ka tuloy na nanonood ka ng "maalaala mo kaya"! :P  thanks, candymates, for fixing the blog a little more and spiffing it up!  cute na ang blog, katulad nating lahat hehehe ;)  btw, ralph, what  was  it you told buwi that you haven't told us yet? could it be...? nagbibinata na si ralph? yiheee!  (pwera biro, hindi ko nga alam... ano nga ba??)  sana makatugtog tayo soon!

      to say that i had a hellish past month is an understatement. that dreaded four-letter word consumed so much of my time. amd with all the stress i had to put up to, the trip to caliraya has been a very welcome breather. t'was not yer regular spa, but it served its purpose. dips in the pool and nature's fresh air played a lot in "de-toxifying" me. hehehe.  the gig last night was another welcome change. i haven't touched my guitar nor a single string in over a month. medyo paranoid nga ako that i might be rusty during the performance. when roel still wasn't there by the time moonstar was into their last few songs, i went back to my panic boy state. and like selena said, good thing he made it just as moonstar were on the last bars of torete.  on stage, all i could hear was allan's guitar, ayn's bass, and roel's drums. i had to turn my volume up to 9 so i could keep up. hehe. not the tightest of set, but we pulled it off... considering that i haven't played with them since UP Fair. this time around, i felt confident with my tone since my favorite mayrics amp... the fender something amp, was back! allan used a stereo setup, figures why he was that loud. Playing Something Wrong aka La Pa, IMHO, was a highlight in our set, although i fumbled quite a bit on the instrumental part.  by the time we finished, everyone kept complimenting us on a nice set. "balanse", "galing", "swak!" were some of the nice words i heard the other bands say. herbert kept asking me what effect i used on La Pa, which really boggled me too since i couldn't explain it well - that i just stumbled upon it while playing around with my effects box.  i also chatted with buwi before i left, and told him something i haven't told the candy guys about yet. so, i guess i have my "own scene" too. *hint* *hint* hehehehe.

      yehoo.  Ayn picked me up at around 9:30 and when we arrived at Mayric's, everyone was there (except Roel, who was still on his flight from Cebu!): Allan, Charles, John Paul, William and Ralph.  Ralph was eating a pork chop meal, which was a relief because he looks so very, very, very thin now.  He said that work has been hell for the past month and that he now has insomnia.  It's not that all this has affected his appetite but that all the unhealthy parts of his lifestyle have refused to let him get fat.  Remember the Colasa's jokes Allan was making about Ralph and the barbecue stick?  Well, he wasn't that far from the truth after all.  But it was really good to see him and I'm sure my other bandmates felt that way, too.  Again, Allan's frivolous plans of disbanding candyaudioline have been foiled, mwahahahahaHAHAHAHA!  John Paul and William were two more refreshing faces as we hadn't seen them in a while.  John Paul has been busy with studies while William has a controversy of his own, about which he reluctantly told me after a lot of wheedling on my part hehehe. Gosh.  Dapat talaga magka Grand Buzz Night Reunion.  Hindi lang alam ng mga tao na marami palang mga behind-the-scenes action hehehe. Exciting!  Superminty opened the night without keyboards, but they still impressed the people. Hebert and Acel kept asking, "Original nila yan???" in tones of disbelief.  After 4 songs, Moonstar88 took the stage with their new member. We were getting nervous because they were about to finish their set and Roel had just arrived in Manila.  He still had to work until the very last minute before rushing to Mayric's in record time for our set. Hats off to you, Roel!  We played a wonderfully loud set of four songs: An Empty You, Better View, Something Wrong and My Silver Chair.  Hopefully, we'll get to practice again soon so we could refresh the old candy songs (which I really miss).  During Empty, Roel took a long time to do the first "bagsak" which is supposed to set everyone off into instrumental, and it was amusing.  Hindi rin kami kasi nagkakarinigan masyado sa stage and I couldn't hear myself at all. I was just hoping to get by in tune.  Afterwards, people were joking Roel about that little mishap hehehe… but everyone said we played a great set and Charles said I didn't go out of tune in Something Wrong (even if Allan thinks I did :P beh!).  It was fantastic to play together again and we were so loud that my ears felt funny when I stepped off the stage.  Someone even said that we looked like the main act because we were much louder and rougher than the other sets that night. Yebah.  It wasn't a perfect set… we've had much better ones, but the fact that we were all together again was remarkable :D  Nakakamiss talaga si Ralph… buti na lang aalis na siya sa trabaho niya next week hwehehehe! But of course, that's more because he's so pooped out from so much work than anything else…  Ayn had to go home early because she still had to finish some stuff for school so it was only Allan, Charles and Me who went to Timog Food Plaza for some Zamboanga chicken.  Kakaiba talaga yung manok dun.  And then we went home.  I don't think we're going to push through with the Wow Philippines gig this Friday but I'm not sure about that. Buzz Night might be held on Black Saturday, but keep posted so you'll know kung tuloy.  Ang tuloy yung Easter Sunday gig sa Millennia na medyo In BeTWEEn Days ang dating. More updates on this soon.   A scene   Candygirl: (to candyboy) Alam mo ba na kami na ni *********? Candyboy: (with true pinoy shock and matching thrown-off-balance action) NGYEH!!! Candygirlette: (laughing) para kang taga AngTV niyan eh! Candygirl: (suddenly and with thrice the feeling of Candyboy's reaction and twice the facial expression) NGEEEHHH!!! (and much more calmly, without missing a beat) wag mo yang ilalagay sa blog ha.

       Act One: "Against Perfection"; Millennia   Let me explain what happened.  Last Friday, during our Deadpan Society gig, Tiffany casually said, "Hey, I heard you guys are playing here on the 15th."  "Huh? I don't think we can. We have a gig that night with The Mongols at Mayric's."  "Talaga? Eh nakita ko dun, eh…" she trails off, leaving me guessing on where "dun" was.  Later, I'm hanging out by the doorway, looking at the posters when I happen to glance at the Millennia calendar.  I do a double take.  "Hey! We're here on the 15th!"  "Sabi sa 'yo eh!"  "Oh, no… nakakahiya naman kung di tayo sumipot eh kaya naman natin ngayon dahil nandyan si Charles. Sige, lagari na lang tayo on that night."  And so the stage was set for this scenario 2 nights later:  Allan, Mike (of Weedisneys and Chicken Pao Productions) and Charles were sitting at a table and Ayn, Roel and I walk in. I say to Mike, "Ayan, hindi ka na galit samin kasi sumipot na kami ngayon," to which Allan interrupts with, "Sabi niya hindi tayo naka-lineup ngayon," and laughs. Mike laughs, too and says, "Hindi, ok lang!"  "Talaga?? Pero nakalagay dun sa calendar sa------" I whirl around to point at the evidence…. And discover that it's no longer there! Mwahahaha…  I examine the night's poster and see that there really is no candy in the line-up for this night (Mike probably thought we wouldn't be able to make it this time either hehehe).  But Mike lets us play anyway, which was nice of him, considering we had just showed up.  Also, Twisted Halo graciously agreed to let us play ahead of them so we could make it to our Mayric's thing earlier (but that's another story).  One of them also lent Ayn his strap.  Thank you.  We did an ok set.  I flubbed the song titles due to some misinformation.  Ah well. Allan got really tired after it so we had to wait there for 20 minutes while he caught his breath again. Meanwhile, he talked to Diego Cambio about cd production (thanks for the tip… can't wait to "hook up" with the cd guy hahaha) and he gave him previews of our upcoming album, pati na rin yung mga Eps ng Pillow at Minty. Sabi niya, "Wow, thank you! Ba't ang bait niyo sakin??" which caught us off guard and I smiled and said something lame like, "Kasi pamangkin kita!" hahaha. Actually, siguro Allan was just feeling… I dunno… nice and Diego happened to be there and he's receptive to that kind of material.  Well, he did give us an idea of where to go to publish the album.  So… Lara dropped by pala because she had a friend who wanted to do a production at Millennia. Soon after, we left for Mayric's.  *  Act Two: "The Mongols and Friends" [title, mine]; Mayric's   We arrived at Mayric's around midnight and Kiko Machine was in the middle of its set.  "Wala si Spiderman."  After Kiko Machine, the main act, The Mongols were set to perform.  We were to do our thing after them so we decided to while the time away eating.  Allan ordered sisig and liempo and rice and we dug in.  The Mongols did about 5 songs, I think. I liked them.  Then it was our turn.  Well… we did ok, too. I couldn't hear myself over the mic but Allan said he could hear me. I was just praying I wouldn't go flat.  But I didn't. It was fun.  Allan's back was killing him halfway through the set and he badly needed to rest.  He asked Jerome (of The Mongols and Teeth, former guitarist of candyaudioline, too) if he wanted to play on "Flaming Walls"--- he agreed to do so for fun :)  It was great, but the dilemma was that Jerome had done lead for the band before, and Allan does rhythm, and Charles doesn't know anything but lead for now.  So we had two lead guitarists… and Jerome kept doing different chords for the pre-chorus part hahaha.  But it was really fun and he obviously enjoyed it.  He was even singing with me and he'd sing "It ain't right" with this exaggerated articulate accent hehe (It aynt rawyt!).  Ely B. (or whatever he'd like to call himself now) just had to take a peek at Jerome playing for us.  After that song, Allan came up to play the last one with us, "My Silver Chair" and we finished the set.  Later, he told us that watching us almost brought tears to his eyes (NO KIDDING!!! He meant this!) because we sounded so good onstage.  "We never get to see ourselves actually playing and, you know, I've found that it's a really great experience to be part of the audience while candyaudioline is performing." Awww… *sniff*, *sniff*.  Anyway, Roel and Kerwin had to leave because they had a 5 am flight to Davao that morning, but the rest of us decided to hang out after that…  *   Act Three: "The Grand Exeunt" (or "Angels Can Dance Really Well in Knee-High Leather Boots")   In gratitude to Charles' heroism these last 4 gigs of candyaudioline, we felt like giving in to his innermost (though unarticulated) desires and return to… er… shall we say, an "old favorite haunt" of our group of friends, the majority of which are male.  Allan, Ayn, Charles and I hopped into a taxi and sped off to…  As expected, The Ladies were very polite and welcoming--- some perhaps delighted at the return of their prodigal friend Sir Charles, others clucking their tongues in reproach at the newfound detachment (totoo ba yan?) of the magnanimous Sir Allan.  We were escorted to our table with a lovely view and given the plastic binder to make our selections for the videoke, which was to happen after the "program".  Of course, the DJ greeted the two men warmly, asking Sir Charles where "Sir Jann Faul" was.  Also, he asked Allan over the sound system if "it was true"… and then promptly welcomed the anonymous "first lady".  Hmm… where'd they hear about that??  And yes… angels do dance well in knee-high leather boots.  It was still relatively uneventful, but fun.  Allan sang "Regret"; we did duets for "I Think We're Alone Now" and "Careless Whisper"; Charles sang "Gaya ng Dati" and dedicated it to The Ladies, and he also sang "The More You Ignore Me, The Closer I Get"; Ayn didn't sing at all, but enjoyed just the same.  I think The Ladies were sorry to see Sir Charles go.  We needed to wait for Ayn to be fetched so we had coffee, pineapple juice and bread and scrambled egg at Ongpin's along Quezon Ave. We had a good long talk about---- you guessed it.  Then, Ayn and I exited stage left while the curtain fell silently on Allan and Charles waiting to pay the bill as the lights faded.  Bow.

      Allan was a little worried about Buzz Night because he had unwittingly lined up 11 bands for the night.  Still, there's something positive about that… before, he had been hard pressed to look for bands who wanted to play.  Now he has enough to resurrect the sometime active event In BeTWEEn Days.  He's thinking of changing the name, though, so that it doesn't have to be specifically restricted to twee, which the event never really was in the first place with bands like us lined up.  I hear there are plans to begin this coming Easter Sunday and he's  already asked Weedisneys and Balloon Derby to perform.  Expect more to come about that.  Anyway, back to Buzz Night--- being worried about the great number of bands set to perform, he decided to start it early.  Kaya lang, pag dating namin dun, wala pang kumpleto nung 9:30, puro mga kulang ng isang member.  Suddenly, the band Five Leaves Left, which played last month but wasn't on this month's line-up, arrived thinking they were set to play.  Since they had come all the way from Paranaque, they begged to perform under any conditions.  Allan decided to let them play 3 songs first so the program could start and they were grateful for the chance.  It was a good idea because it gave the other bands time to complete their members.  Matilda was up next, with Ayn sessioning for one song (but it was good to see Yvette again). Then the much awaited Sonnet LVIII.  Buti na lang nakakapagtugtog uli si Nelson, kaya lang paalis ata yung brother ni Rommel for abroad so Buzz Night was supposedly going to be their last performance. Aww, damn.  They gave an awesome set, and next came Popular Days.  Lasing na si Charles by then. Don't ask. Pero syempre, hindi naman sila nagkalat.  Skrew Ups played next and they gave a refreshing set… my gosh, if I remember correctly it's been a year since they last performed at Buzz Night.  Then came candyaudioline and Charles, despite his tipsiness (a little of his buzz had worn off by then), did us justice.  He was even brave enough to do "My Silver Chair" with us, though he was caught off guard by Ayn and Roel conspiring for a long version.  Balloon Derby followed, with Wally greeting the audience with, "Welcome to Buzz Nights(!)" Hehe… pero ok yung set nila ha, kahit wala nang nagke-keyboard.  This Buzz Night ko lang sila talaga pinakinggan and I liked one of their songs.  Hmm… teka… kasalanan ba ng Superminty kung ba't wala na silang keyboards??? Si William kasi dati yung nagba-bass para sa kanila, kaya lang, ngayon na wala siya, yung keyboardist na nila ang nagba-bass! Oh no…  Hmmm… should I start a blog for Superminty, too?  Si William nagtatampo ata samin kasi wala kami masyadong tugtog na lined up.  Feeling niya ata, we're leaving him out. Hindi no! I asked Allan, "Ba't di mo siya pinapunta dito sa Buzz Night??"  Allan said, "Sinabihan ko siya! Ewan ko kung ba't wala siya dito."  Naku, William, wag ka nang magtampo… tapos na nga yung ating malupit na EP eh… ;)  Next, performed the ever-reliable Tether.  I really liked their last song, but I noticed that the oomph I was looking for wasn't there.  Then I realized it was because they had a different drummer that night. Later, I learned that their real drummer was sessioning for the Phil. Violators so he couldn't make it.  Finally, Skies of Ember performed as the last band for the night.  They gave a great set, although Dott-dott was having difficulty because his guitar kept going out of tune… was that why he wasn't able to sing the chorus for their song from the Mutual compilation album? Sayang. Pero ok na ok pa rin sila despite the setbacks.  Weedisneys passed by, but since they weren't lined up, Allan had to put them last… only Mike had work at 1 am so they ended up leaving. Well, it was good to see their continued support for Buzz Night.  Afterwards, we weren't able to eat out because nobody had money. Sigh.  Because recording sessions are officially finished, it's time to pay the bill. Oh well.  Tonight, we will be playing with The Mongols, Stonefree and Gish at Mayric's and then we'll be heading to Millennia after that for a gig as well. See you!

      Our first gig in a little more than a month, due to Ralph's unavailability, Deadpan Society at Millennia was something the band looked forward to.  We forced Charles to study our songs so he could sub for Ralph; by 8 pm he was texting Allan that he was apologizing in advance for ruining our gig.  Allan and I arrived at Millennia at 9:30 pm and some of the bands were already there.  Tiffany was worrying and moaning about the fact that Incubus was playing at CCP that night.  We told her, don't worry, there are probably lots of people who couldn't afford going to Incubus who will probably drop by, don't worry, let's just have fun.  I forgot the name of the band that opened for the night… Charles arrived around that time and we were busy reassuring him that he didn't have to feel pressured because we were just happy to be playing again.  "Eh, hindi, eh… 'di ko kasi makapa lahat tapos sobra na akong kinakabahan!"  "Ok lang yon! Kahit gumawa ka na lang ng version mo ng mga lead parts!"  Next, Silent Sanctuary played.  I liked the strings.  Then, Paramita performed.  Ria, the drummer was the organizer of the event and she was the one who contacted Ayn and booked us (Thanks again!).  Next, played Bagetsafonik, whose set impressed Allan, who is considering including them in a future Buzz Night now that he's actually heard them.  After that band, we performed with Charles and it was a considerably good set.  As usual, I felt a little rusty after our hiatus, but it was fun to be onstage again.  We were really satisfied with Charles's performance, too, because we didn't feel as if Ralph wasn't with us------ he had to modify some guitar lines, but he was able to simulate Ralph fairly well. It was almost the same level of… um, I don't exactly know what to call it… "intensity"? In any case, it was a lot of fun and we were really grateful that Charles agreed to do it for us.  Of course, we still miss Ralph.  Then, Agartha's Remorse, last band for the night, performed two songs.  We were especially waiting for them because the band is composed of Ayn, Charms, Lara and my younger sister Edwina, who is a fledgling guitarist.  The latter's friends had come to support her and they were screaming her name, along with yours truly, who was in turn marveling at her "baby sister growing up" hehehe. I know. I'm cheesy :D kulang na lang mag-baby babble ako dito, eh hehehe.  Natuwa din sina Charles, Roel, Kaye at Allan sa kanila kasi the girls had had only a few practices and they were performing Within Temptation and Sisters of Mercy fairly well.  Natuwa sila especially kay Lara kasi hindi daw siya nag-kick sa last part ng "Lucretia…"  They were shouting, "Dream come true para sa drummer!!!"  After the gig, we brought Lara and Kaye to where May was waiting for them (Freedom Bar) so they could pass by the Amoeba event of the Lubitels, TV Guide and Carnival Park.  Then we went on to Colasa's for a food trip.  After eating, Allan started goofing off.  We were talking about Ralph and then he picked up a barbecue stick and said, "Ralph… Ralph… kumusta ka na?"  Tapos sa kalamansi na piga na, sabi niya, "Roel… Roel…" and then he picked up two barbecue sticks, formed them into a cross, then pointed it at Ayn and said, "Ayn… Ayn…"  Sayang nga kasi wala siyang ginawa para sakin… it's either wala siyang maisip or he was scared of consequential "sanctions"--- hehe! Basta ang dami pa niyang ginawa tapos tawa kami ng tawa dun. Hay.

      Candyaudioline will be playing at Buzz Night on the 13th. I don't know the final list of performers yet but Allan will probably post it within the next few days.  Also, we'll be playing on the 15th at Mayric's with Stonefree and The Mongols and Gish.  Ralph, for the umpteenth time, we wish you could make it because we really miss you.   Please.  But if not, we are making sure that somebody else will be there to sub for you.  By hook or by crook, we will play on these dates.  The other night, magkasama si Ayn at si Allan sa Ratsky Malate. I was at home resting. Sayang. Last night, I ignored my fatigue to meet Allan and Roel at Lyceum, Intramuros because I needed to get out.  Some bastards there harassed Acel by holding her and pulling her hair and pushing her head while she was walking past.  We had been way behind her around the corner, so we weren't able to catch them in the act, so we couldn't beat the crap out of them. Fricking bastards.  I wanted to be violent last night. I know that if I had gotten into a fight, someone would most probably have kicked my teeth in or something, but I was in a seething, silent rage and didn't really care. If only we had seen the guy. I would have loved to elbow him in the face and feel his eyeball pop into his skull.  Ew. Did I just type that? That was gross. But it would have been lovely.  Tonight, we will be doing vocals for the two remaining songs in the candyaudioline album. Yehey.

      Saturday night, Allan brought me with him to work in Baguio.  He clarified from the start that it wouldn't be a leisure trip since he had to help oversee Parokya Ni Edgar's welfare during a Bombo Radyo stint there.  I was just eager to tag along for a refreshing, albeit brief, change of scenery.  We left Manila Sunday early morning and made several Shell Select stops on the way before finally reaching Baguio at 6 am.  Roel was there to roadie.  We felt a little wistful that the three of us were already there--- with Ayn and Ralph along, we would have been complete! Maybe they'd even have let us play front act if we were all there, since the only performers that night were Aleck Bovick, the Sooperbabes and PNE. But of course, just bringing me along was already a burden on Backbeat, and besides, hindi siguro sulit kung lahat kami pumunta dun tapos balik din the same night. But going to Baguio last Sunday did serve as an initial scan of what we could possibly do if there were to be a candyaudioline Baguio trip in the future.  Going home, the wheels in our heads were turning on how to make such an outing feasible.  Anyway, I'm not really going to talk at length about my personal Baguio experience.  We didn't really get to roam around and do the usual things.  When we arrived at the transient house, we slept until one then woke up to have lunch at the ihaw places next to Burnham. Allan and I hadn't even bathed yet because we had only planned to eat then go home but we started browsing through ukay for a preview of things to purchase in the afternoon. Suddenly, Roel texted that they were already on their way to the radio station and so Allan and I had to nix our plans (including baths!) to accompany them.  It was like this for the rest of the day--- tight schedules--- but we were finally able to bath in the afternoon, at least.  So we weren't really able to do any sightseeing… we just visited the SM Baguio (which isn't all that bad with its wide terraces perfect for a view of the metro) and Allan shopped for underwear. Haha.  What I really want to talk about is the concert itself, or rather, the preparations for the concert.  It was held at the oval behind Burnham Park and by the time we arrived there (7 pm) people were streaming in by the hundreds.  Then, the fireworks started and they were soooo beautiful! I had never experienced fireworks like that before, missing both the Centennial and Millennium celebrations. Afterwards, the people's energy was so high and they closed in on the stage--- Bombo Radyo security had to step in and push people back to make leeway for the crew and the artists.  The audience did comply, but already I was thinking that Bombo Radyo lacked a bit of foresight with the preparations if they hadn't thought of doing that at set-up time.  So the Backbeat crew started doing soundcheck.  This is something they usually do hours before the program, but until 6 pm there had been another event at the venue and a different sound system was being used.  When they were finally given the go signal to soundcheck, Backbeat encountered several problems: the sound system was undermanned, the board was set up weirdly and had to be heavily troubleshot, and the set-up onstage wasn't working properly.  Particularly, the monitors for the drums was kaput and Roel spent more than 45 minutes pounding the kick while Rommel (of Sonnet LVIII) fixed the board.  They were so pissed at the inefficiency of the sound system that tempers started to rise at nagtampo si Kerwin (bassist of Aspirin, who was setting up onstage) kay Rommel.  The crowd was getting restless and so was the organizer… but of course, the guys refused to start until they had fixed everything because the band would suffer under existing conditions.  It was becoming frustrating for everyone… so much that the guys started making wry jokes over the monitors.  Some examples:   1.  (After a particularly exasperated comment from Rommel) Allan: O, puso mo, Rommel.  Alam mo namang matanda ka na.  Paano na yung pamilya mo? Yung boyfriend mo?  Sino na ba ngayon--- si Randy na ba? Rommel:  Hindi. Si David na. Ikaw ba, sino na? Allan:  Bago na. Si Benjo na.  Guwapong-guwapo.  Itong si Sherwin may hinahada din kanina eh.  (Points microphone at Sherwin the driver in talk show host fashion) Ano bang pangalan nun, Sherwin? Peter di ba?    2. Rommel:  O, ayan.  Umaandar na ba ang amp? Allan:  Hindi "umaandar" ang amp, pare. "Tumutunog". Rommel:  Yun na nga yung tinatanong ko, eh.  Kasi kung umaandar, pigilan niyo sana at delikado na. Baka wala pa tayong magamit mamaya.  3. Rommel:  May tao na ba diyan, Lan? Allan: Ay hindi, pare, wala pang tao. Tingnan mo nga, walang laman nga yung field, eh.  Ay… ah, tao ng sound system pala.  Oo, meron nang tao dito. Naghahanap lang sila ng masasaksakan. Rommel:  Naku. Sino ba yung gusto nilang saksakan? Allan: Ikaw.  4. Rommel:  Kerwin, gumagana ba yung bass amp? Kerwin? Kerwin? Allan:  Pare, wag mo nang utusan si Kerwin at nagtatampo yan sa 'yo. Rommel: Ah talaga.  Sabihin mo sa kanya, I love you. Allan: I love you, too, pare. Rommel: Hindi, para kay Kerwin yun. Allan:  Pare, hindi ka niya mahal.   Of course, this was all on the monitors, so people couldn't really hear the bastos parts.  I think they should have done it on the house speakers, though, para naaliw naman yung mga tao kahit papaano habang naghihintay.  People were really pissed off by 9 pm because Bombo Radyo had promised that it would start by 7.  The organizers were getting impatient, too, and Allan had to use all his self-control to be polite about the situation.  The fact was that if the planning had been more efficient, even with a sucky sound system, they would have been able to fix the problem way ahead of time.  In fairness to the people in Baguio, organizers and audience, even if they were really pissed off, they didn't boo loudly at the roadies as they fixed the stage; the most they did was mock-cheer when Roel pounded on the drums and Kerwin tried the bass.  At around 9:30 pm, Rommel finally gave the signal to start and the Sooperbabes came on.  I really enjoyed Aleck Bovick's performance, by the way.  She's one courageous chick.  Hero na namin siya ni Allan.  Anyway, witnessing this, I realized how difficult the crew's job is.   They're the unsung heroes of gigs.   To end this story, Rommel and Kerwin kissed and made up in the following manner:   Kerwin: (to Allan) Lan, hindi ako pwede sa Parokya Mayric's sa Tuesday ha. Allan: Oo, sige. Rommel:  (annoyed) O baket na naman? Kerwin: (gives Rommel the evil eye and an "I'm-still-not-friends-with-you-so-what-makes-you-think-you-can-talk-to-me" look) Basta, Allan, di ako pwede nun. Rommel: (annoyed) BAKET hindi? Kerwin: (more annoyed) ANO BA? Kung ikaw, makakapunta, wala nakong pake dun! Allan: Pupunta ka ba, Rommel? Rommel: Hindi rin hehehehe. (everyone, including Kerwin, laughs)   We left for Manila, Monday early morning at 1 am.  *  Last Wednesday, we spent the holiday resting. I went to Allan's house in the afternoon and let him listen to some funny recordings I made with the minus ones and my own voice.  He said he had been doing the same thing that morning!  He set up his stereo so we could make more recordings and we played around with some of the minus ones we had made. Ayn had a gig at Millennia with Matilda so it was only me, Allan and Charles who watched a movie, "Lost In Translation". I loved Bill Murray's performance and Ms. Johannsen wasn't too bad herself. I remember she was that child star in "The Horse Whisperer"… it's great that one of her first mature roles was in an acclaimed movie. An Oscar snub won't hurt her career. Pshaw. Hehe… anyway, we decided to pass by Ayn's gig, only we missed their performance.  She was outside talking to Matilda.  They in turn asked Allan some advice about their recording offers.  Afterwards, we went inside to drink and watched a screening of one of Quark Henares' short films.  I suddenly had an asthma attack (hindi na ako sanay sa beer) so my friends kindly bought me some medicine and took me home (thanks, guys!). I heard that Charles and Ayn had some more drinks later that night but I think Allan went home, too.  Tonight, Allan was supposed to make candyaudioline play at the PNE Mayric's gig but he texted Ralph last night and Ralph said he couldn't make it. Shucks. He must still be sick. Superminty is playing tonight.  I really miss candy.  Reeeeeeeally.  The Soft Pillow Kisses recording sounds really good!  Luie has certainly shined in this one… we're very impressed at the output. Expect a good SPK EP sometime soon…  I've finished printing the candyblog! It's ring bound and ready for perusal.  Allan and I were having fun reading it over the weekend… ang dami na niyang nakalimutan na funny things na sobrang sarap sariwain. 148 pages! Buti na lang I took advantage of our office supplies hehehe. Meany.  Allan made a revised track list for our recording and it sounds great! This time, the sequence of the songs flowed well so that each track complemented the next.  We still have to hit the studio for two songs but that will be easy, as soon as Ralph is ok.   Wish we could play together again soon.

      Last night, Ayn invited Allan and I to her graduation dinner at Saisaki West Avenue where we had a Japanese buffet. Yum.  Tristania was there and she looks like she's three years old!  She kept going up to Allan to be hugged and put on his lap. Siguro kasi ang lambot niya hehe.  Charms was with us, too.  Ayn told us about her graduation ceremony the day before and how Ralph and Charmaine had texted her while they were at Philcoa; they wanted to attend her graduation, which was very sweet of them.  They did, and Ayn had wanted to let them have dinner with her at their house, but she had to rush to Sickfest that night.  After the dinner, we decided to go to Sharky's for some drinks.  Charms had to go home, though, so we just asked Charles to follow.  I texted Ralph to join us, but he had been doing laundry and only saw my message as we were leaving the bar. We talked about a lot of things, some concerning Candy, like the recording, and some just plain wala lang.  It was a nice get-together and we didn't get drunk or anything like that.  Congratulations, Ayn!!! Woohoo!  +++  I know people are wondering about the recording.  We have every intention of releasing our album.  We're just waiting for funds.  I know we said this for the last EP, but this time, we mean it.  We're happy with our output and we're just waiting for the means to share it with everyone.  Hopefully, by May, finances will allow for the reproduction of our cds.

      Buzz Night went well last April 24, 2004 at Mayric's.  I arrived slightly later than my initially planned 9:30 pm and was so nervous about how the night was going to proceed under my supervision.  Allan was away in Makati for work and wouldn't be there until past midnight, hence, I was tasked to receive the bands and decide on a sequence.  The fact that I was lugging around Lara's super huge and super heavy keyboard didn't help my nerves one bit.  Flustered, I recognized Joel of Tether and the vocalist of Five Leaves Left and I asked them if they were complete; Five Leaves was, but not Tether.  Okay, one band.  I was so out-of-sorts that I rushed inside without letting my friends in (one of whom was lugging the keyboard for me)--- I rushed back out to retrieve them, then I approached a guy I recognized to be the bassist of Koza Nostra.  I asked him if they were complete; okay, two bands.  Then, Paolo of Bagetsafonik said hi and I asked them if they were complete and he confirmed that they were; then I asked if they wanted to perform first… he said, if possible, they'd like to perform 3rd.  Suddenly, Omnie of Five Leaves was beside me asking where Allan was, and for a second, I just looked at him blankly when I realized his question and I answered that he was at work in Makati.  I asked him when they wanted to perform and he said, "Siguro 2nd or 3rd," then I returned to Koza Nostra and asked  them  what they preferred.  To my relief, they said they'd like to go first.  So, I had three bands and a good line-up of three so far.  Whew.  That was easy.  Koza Nostra started at about 10:15 and Buzz Night was good to go.  The reason I was nervous that night was because there had been a lot of bands lined-up and we weren't sure we'd be able to accommodate them all and finish at a comfortable hour.  Some bands like Jello Torpedo and Carnival Park let us know that they couldn't come before that night, but as far as we knew, everyone else on the line-up was coming.  Einstein Chakras didn't come, though, and neither did Boldstar.  Weedisneys wanted to play but Mike texted that they didn't have a bassist and he asked me if anybody at Mayric's wanted to session and jam with them.  I didn't know the bands so well that night so I couldn't assure him of a bassist (though I DID have someone in mind, mwahaha), but I told him to come anyway and then look for a bassist when they were there.  Guess they decided not to risk it after all, which was really a pity as I was hoping to hear them again. The good thing about some bands not playing, though, was the fact that we didn't need to worry about finishing late and that the bands present could play more songs than we had initially planned.  Candyaudioline couldn't play because Roel wasn't sure to come back from Baguio in time and Ayn had a gig at the Sickfest.  Actually, Roel DID arrive in time, but unfortunately, Ayn already had her commitment and Ralph was nowhere to be found.  Eloha (former SPK vocalist) was there that night and Lara was early (surprise!).  Charles and the PopDays guys arrived at around the time Five Leaves was playing.  Knowing that Tether would probably be the only other non-Allan band left to play that night aside from Popular days, I asked him if he and the guys could perform after Bagetsafonik.  He said that he had asked Allan if they could play when he was there already so he'd be able to fix the sound system for them while they were onstage (we all know how fantastic the mayric's mics are).  That sort of ruined my plans a bit because I knew we'd all be lined up after one another (Popdays, Superminty and Pillow) and thought that it might come across as weird.  The Five Leaves vocalist gave me a sticker when they left (yay! Sticker!).  Bagetsafonik played a good set and the vocalist said, "Thank you kay Sir Allan… at kay Selena," which made me think, "Wow, someone said my name onstage!" but also made me feel embarrassed because I hadn't really done much… and then I laughed because I noticed that everyone calls Allan "sir", which probably makes him feel bad because everybody else with him (including me) doesn't get any titles like that.  Tether played a very good set, even if it was only four songs long… I really love that last song they always play.  Anyway, Allan arrived as Tether was playing and he commented that they were tight and improving.  He asked me how things were going and I recounted the night to him.  Of course, I was (ahem) rewarded for my valiant efforts :D  He asked me who else was going to play and I said, "Popdays, Minty and Pillow.  Yun na lang."  "Hah?  Wala nang ibang banda sa pagitan natin?"  "Wala, eh!  Sabi ko kay Charles kanina, mauna sila sa Tether pero ayaw niya kasi daw hihintayin ka nila para makapagpihit ka para sa kanila sa board!"  He turned to Charles and touched his nose.  "Charles--- ba't ka nagiinarte diyan!"  "Eh, ALLAaaaN!!!!!… di ko naman alam na tayo na lang pala natitira.  Akala ko maraming banda eh!"  "Eh di magmumukhang tanga tayo mamaya, Charles… magmumukhang tanga tayo dahil sa YO!" and then they wrestled in their seats, which was not much of a match since all Allan had to do was lean heavily on Charles.  Tawa kami ng tawa dun.  Ang kawawa sa ganung arrangement, si Jann Paul, who plays drums for all three bands.  After his set with Popular Days, which was wonderful, though they claim it was full of mistakes, Jann Paul was so tired and his sticks had almost snapped in two.  Allan let him rest for a couple of minutes before Superminty started and he told us to play a laid back set.  The Superminty set was fine from our point of view, but we didn't know how we sounded to the audience.  Then, Soft Pillow Kisses played next with Eloha as vocalist (Luie had a previous engagement).  They sounded great, of course.  Allan had me sing the last song because Eloha didn't know it ("Wasting Opportunities").  After Buzz Night, we went to Timog Food Plaza to hang out.  It took us longer to order than usual because Allan spaced out for about 20 minutes--- he was so tired from 2 Moonstar gigs that night plus two sets for Buzz night.  His waist was killing him and all he could do at TFP was sit resting with his brain turned off.  I kept telling the others to order ahead but they all wanted to wait for Allan, which puzzled me because they were all obviously hungry.  I guess everyone was tired, including myself, having been a bundle of nerves the whole night.  But once Allan had recharged a bit, it was back to the normal kulitan.  Ian and Allan had a discussion about Soulseek adventures and his plan (hopefully) to buy airtime for an indie radio show.  Unfortunately, it seems that that won't push through because airtime is uber expensive these days.  Ian was telling Allan about a similar endeavor he and his friends made before.  I hope they could someday figure out a way to follow these plans through despite all the obstacles.  We all went home after that.

      Allan and I arrived at the venue at around 8:30 and we ordered a pizza.  Call time was 9:30 pm.  Roel arrived at 9.  Ralph didn’t answer our texts so Allan asked Charles to come and help us.  At 9:30, Ralph texted me and asked if we were good to go at Bistro; he had been locked out of the house for 4 hours and his phone had been inside all that time.  “Paano yan, papuntahin ko siya?”  Allan sighed. “Eh sinabihan ko na si Charles!”  “Sayang naman di ba?”  “Kung gusto niyo, tatlo na lang yung gitara.”  Charles arrived towing Ian’s bass, his and Allan’s guitars.  For some reason we had… er… forgotten to tell him that Ralph was coming.  Ayn arrived with her own bass, but opted to use Ian’s instead.  I asked her, “Alam mo na ba yung secret ni Ralph?”  “Hindi pa.”  “Ayun, o!” I pointed to Charmaine’s stomach as she and Ralph entered 70’s Bistro.  Ayn screamed in sheer delight, surprised at the good news.  I think Charles was just as surprised as her, but for different reasons, hehehe.  During setup, Charles was a little relieved to let Ralph play alone, though.  We played Something Wrong, Discarded Toy, An Empty You and Flaming Walls.  Then one of Ralph’s strings snapped and so we had to play just two more songs instead of four more.  The last two were Felt So Fine and My Silver Chair.  I felt very rusty, but people said we sounded good.  After sitting awhile, we decided to head on to Mayric’s where Allan needed to oversee a Moonstar-Kamikazee gig.  Roel had to stay to roadie for Parokya while Ralph and Charmaine went home to get rest.  Ayn brought us to Mayric’s and had a beer before heading home to rest.  She had an exam for law school the next day.  The rest of us stayed on, then went home when it was finished.  No strength nor moolah to do anything else.  +++  Buzz Night Lineup (Saturday, 4/24/04) Mayric’s, 9:30 pm  Popular Days Tether  Bagetsafonik Jello Torpedo Boldstar Einstein Chakras Koza Nostra Carnival Park Five Leaves Left

      RANDAL: Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back?  DANTE (exasperated): Empire.  RANDAL: Blasphemy.  DANTE: Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett. It ends on such a down note. I mean, that's what life is - a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.  RANDAL: There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.  DANTE: What's that?  RANDAL: All right, Vader's boss...  DANTE: The Emperor.  RANDAL: Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?  DANTE: How do you mean?  RANDAL: Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.  DANTE: I guess.  RANDAL: Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.  DANTE: Yeah.  RANDAL: Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.  DANTE: It would stand to reason, yes.  RANDAL: Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.  DANTE: More or less.  RANDAL: The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.  DANTE: I think they were Catholics.  RANDAL: You know what else I noticed in Jedi?  DANTE: There's more?  RANDAL: So they build another Death Star, right?  DANTE: Yeah.  RANDAL: Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.  DANTE: Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.  RANDAL: And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.  DANTE: Compliments of Lando Calrissian.  RANDAL: Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it, but something just wasn't right.  DANTE: And you figured it out?  RANDAL: Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army - storm troopers, dignitaries - the only people onboard were Imperials.  DANTE: Basically.  RANDAL: So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.  DANTE: And the second time around...?  RANDAL: The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.  DANTE: So?  RANDAL: A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.  DANTE: Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.  RANDAL: Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.  DANTE: All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you so upset with its destruction?  RANDAL: All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed - casualties of a war they had nothing to do with. 			 (notices Dante's confusion) All right, look - you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia - this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius. You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics. You're just trying to scrape out a living.  BLUE-COLLAR MAN: Excuse me. I don't mean to interrupt, but what were you talking about?  RANDAL: The ending of Return of the Jedi.  DANTE: My friend is trying to convince me that any contractors working on the uncompleted Death Star were innocent victims when the space station was destroyed by the rebels.  BLUE-COLLAR MAN: Well, I'm a contractor myself. I'm a roofer... Dunn and Reddy Home Improvements. And speaking as a roofer, I can say that a roofer's personal politics come heavily into play when choosing jobs.  RANDAL: Like when?  BLUE-COLLAR MAN: Three months ago I was offered a job up in the hills. A beautiful house with tons of property. It was a simple reshingling job, but I was told that if it was finished within a day, my price would be doubled. Then I realized whose house it was.  DANTE: Whose house was it?  BLUE-COLLAR MAN: Dominick Bambino's.  RANDAL: "Babyface" Bambino? The gangster?  BLUE-COLLAR MAN: The same. The money was right, but the risk was too big. I knew who he was, and based on that, I passed the job on to a friend of mine.  DANTE: Based on personal politics.  BLUE-COLLAR MAN: Right. And that week, the Foresci family put a hit on Babyface's house. My friend was shot and killed. He wasn't even finished reshingling.  RANDAL: No way!  BLUE-COLLAR MAN: I'm alive because I knew there were risks involved taking on that particular client. My friend wasn't so lucky. Any contractor willing to work on that Death Star knew the risks. If they were killed, it was their own fault. A roofer listens to this... 			 (taps his heart) not his wallet.   - scene from Clerks (by Kevin Smith)

      got a text from ayn yesterday confirming that she will graduate this april. congratulations, ayn.  last night, soft pillow kisses fronted for parokya ni edgar at mayric's and i tagged along. saw luie and lara for the first time in ages.    ralph passed by because he had something he needed to get from gab for one of his rackets (he's out of work now and subsisting on projects).  said he had been asleep when we texted him the last time but we asked if he could go on wednesday (just in case) and buzz night (kaya lang baka si allan naman ang di pwede nun, but that's another story...). tinanong na namin siya kung ano yung secret niya and it truly is happy news. congratulations, ralph.  i went home as the parokya set started.  p.s. [written hours after as i forgot to publish this post this morning) if it's an emergency (requires immediate revision) and if the statement concerns the person, s/he can edit it without having to inform the author. i only didn't want an extreme "gaguhan" of other people's entries... corrections are legal and are every member's right, of course.  hmmm, you know what i was thinking when ayn said that the "thin allan" pics were a winner? haha! i'll tell next gig...  by the way, a few more old candy pics are available on the e-groups site.

       Palm Sunday:   Allan and I went to former candy guitarist Joey Santos' son Joshua's christening. Saw Joyjoy of Skies of Ember (I only found out that day that Joyjoy is Joey's uncle!) and had a good Chinese lunch.  Went to Greenhills to have ourselves duped by cellphone repairmen.  Went to Popular Days' recording in scary Tondo.   Monday:  Allan picked me up and we hung out at Sharky's Timog.  He wanted to drink away his woes.  Texted Charles to join us and he did, but he was too woeful himself to really drink a lot. Allan regaled me with stories from old candy days that took place at that very same bar.  We ended up drunk and we walked along Timog looking for coffee and hot chocolate, which we found at Burger Machine, Timog Food Plaza.   Tuesday:  I can't recall what happened last Tuesday.  I think there was a gig that night with The Youth and The Wuds at Mayric's.  Yeah, that was it.  We kept texting and texting Ralph but he wouldn't answer texts  nor  phone calls. Had Charles session for us. Pissed off some Wuds fans because they hated our instrumentals :D I dedicated the rest of the set to them.  Roel kept doing gross things to Ayn like putting his feet on the table in front of her and she screamed.  Probably pissed off one of The Wuds because it was so quiet and we were so noisy :D oops.   Wednesday:  Met up with Eloha, Jann Paul, Charles and Allan to watch "The Passion" at Megamall.  Ate at KFC and wandered around a bit to look for stuff to buy. Saw the never-ending line for "The Passion" and opted instead to catch "50 First Dates", which was definitely cool.  At around 8 pm, we took ourselves to Sharky's and had some California iced tea… we were splattered in less than 30 minutes.  Allan played his two indie compilation cds over the sound system. Texted Ayn to join us.  Wrote about her experience on the back of Allan's Astroplus receipt while I was drunk:  Si Ayn. Pagod yung Daddy ni Ayn na maghatid.  Nag-commute si Ayn.  She wore her Dead Kennedy's t-shirt and full goth  [actually it was punk!]  set-up so she wouldn't be raped.  She walked all the way to Commonwealth. Nag-jeep lang siya to Philcoa!!! But she said that the scariest part was the taxi from Philcoa to Sharky's. Tingin daw ng tingin yung driver sa kanya sa rearview mirror.  Tinanong sa kanya, "Ineng, nagbabanda ka ba?"  "Opo."  "Ah, parang Aegis?"  "Hindi po, manong. 'Bundok ni Satanas'."   Putangina!     Holy Thursday:  No candyaudioline members met this day.  Allan slept the whole day. I met with family members.  Ayn went to my house. Roel was probably with… erm… someone.  Ralph was in limbo.   Good Friday:   Allan brought his player and some DVDs to my house; Eloha and Charles arrived and we all watched "Mallrats" and "Dogma".  Bought a case of beer and some munchies at the corner grocer.  We were bringing the stuff to our house when our new landlord arrived in his car.  I begged Allan to stay back so the guy wouldn't see that we were planning to drink on the rooftop again… the case was heavy and Allan and Charles were having a hard time holding it.  When the coast was clear, we stole upstairs with our drinks.  Went up to the rooftop around midnight to hang out and play the guitar under the stars.  We all fell asleep and they woke at around 5 am to leave… but Allan wanted to eat pancit canton so they ended up leaving at 6.   Black Saturday:  Allan and I went to Tutuban Center to have his phone fixed at Joey's WellCom branch.  Joey let us see his old candy pics where Allan was still thin.  They listened to compilations over the store's sound system while waiting for the technician to fix Allan's phone.  We ate snacks at KFC then bought some DVDs then bought baby things and then we gave Joey a ride home when he was finished with work.  We ate dinner and then went to Mayric's for our Black Saturday gig.  Ralph couldn't make it because he needed to be home early. No one was there.  Koza Nostra played first, then Sadie, then Tether, then us.  It was great… kaya lang ang kulit namin nung kami na kasi halos wala nang tao… we were goofing off onstage.  Ate at Zamboanga chicken then went our separate ways.   Easter Sunday:  Met up with Allan to go to the PopDays recording. I got to play my Fernando while they were laying in one song.  Allan, like the producer that he is, slept through the whole thing.  We then had dinner at 9 pm at Pares Kamuning before going home.  Saw that Millennia was still closed and it didn't look as if it would open anytime soon.  +++  Buzz Night is on the 24th.   *borrowed from the title of a play by Dario Fo

      Allan, Charles, John Paul and I attended Erap Carrasco's wedding last Saturday somewhere in Taguig.  The taxi taking us there made a wrong turn at the Magallanes cloverleaf and we had to make our u-turn 10 million miles away in order to get back on track. On a minor scale, the same thing happened at the Nichols Bridge, but somehow, we finally arrived at the meeting place (Taguig hospital) with our tempers intact.  The soon-to-be newlyweds led us to the reception house where we were to eat and drink in bliss while waiting for the actual wedding to take place.  Then they left to "prepare" for the civil ceremony.  We listened to the 1896 album blaring over the radio and sipped our beers while watching the neighbor's pet geese going through the preliminaries of the mating ritual.  Seemed like an appropriate echo of the union that was about to occur.  It was quite a wait and we were wondering what was taking the couple so long.  It turned to be the ceremony itself--- probably in their panic at time swiftly passing, they decided to head straight to the judge's place.  Oh, well… at least they were married!  Charles, Allan and I had a funny scene while waiting for Erap and Cheche to come back.  Charles and John Paul had gone back inside where Dodong was sitting to cool themselves, leaving Allan and I outside alone.  Allan discovered that the zipper of his pants had gone bust, but he couldn't bend over to examine it because of his belly.  So I sat down on a stool in front of him and gingerly examined the crotch area of his jeans.  The zipper had somehow gotten free of its teeth and so, I figured, all I had to do was rehook the teeth into it like the way one does with a jacket.  I asked Allan to step closer to me and, as I tried to fix his zipper, Charles suddenly appeared in the doorway, saying something to Allan.  He stopped in mid-sentence as he stared at us wide-eyed and took it all in. To this minute, I cannot help laughing every time I recall the look on his face.  Allan had been leaning casually against the wall, with nary a care in the world; I had my face less than a foot away from his crotch while I handled his uncooperative zipper… of course, once we realized Charles was there, I jerked upright and stared back at him with dropped jaw.  "I-I-inaayos ko lang yung---!"  "Hindi, aalis na ako…"  Allan and I laughed in total embarrassment.  "CHAARLESSS!!! Wala kaming ginawa!"  Anyway, he believed us. I think, hehehe.  We had to leave soon after Robert Javier arrived because we had planned to meet Ayn at Glorietta.  After meeting her at Tower Records, we snaked our way through the mall to look for this store where Allan (very understandably) wished to buy a new pair of plus size jeans.  However, Glorietta being the proverbial minotaur's lair, we wasted so much time that we decided to just have dinner at Chicken Bacolod, which was another story in itself.  I was thirsty, I was tired… suffice it to say that I made a tiny scene with the waiters.  I may have acted in a slightly ill mannered way, but you all know that one of my biggest pet peeves is bad service.  Ten o'clock was approaching and Popular Days had a scheduled practice at Sam's so we decided to get going in the cheapest way possible--- by bus! The only seats available for us were the ones before the back so Ayn headed straight for them.  As she tried to slide into one row, the seat suddenly fell with a loud crash and we all snickered loudly.  Then the bus started to move and Allan was losing his balance fast--- but he couldn't fit into the row Ayn and I had taken and he had to sit in the one opposite… even then, he could barely squeeze his butt onto the seat because it was so narrow!  He moaned and groaned while we laughed and a lot of the passengers turned to look at how scandalous we were being. We seemed like characters out of a horrible pinoy comedy flick.    Popular Days lost no time in practicing upon arrival at JR Studio.  By the time Eric had arrived, the other three had troubleshot some songs (this was all in preparation for their recording this week. Finally!!!). While we were listening to them practice, Ayn's parents had arrived with Tristania in tow.  Ayn brought her into the studio, and at first, she was scared because of the loud instruments and some new people.  But she didn't cry and Ayn covered her little ears so she could watch what these strange grown-ups were doing.  A few minutes later, she ventured to stand by herself in the middle of the room so she could see everyone better, then she started to tap her tummy to the beat of the music.  A little later, she started clapping her hands, then after that she would bob up and down as though dancing!  We were all so delighted with her.  We were teasing Charles, "Ayan, indie na indie pala kayo kasi gusto ni Tristia yung music niyo."  Tristia was so cute!  For more amusement in this account of last Saturday's events, add a sprinkling of "Rainier!" and "Salbakuta!" shouts from passersby.  * Gigsked:  Black Saturday--- Mayric's With  Concrete Sam Sadie And more…  Easter Sunday--- Millennia (may kuryente na nun!!!)  April 24, Buzz Night--- Mayric's

      habang nasa boracay si allan at nagmoo-moonbathing sa beach kagabi, tinawagan namin siya ni Ayn sa cellphone all the way from cubao dahil lasing kami.  pagkatapos niya kami kausapin, nakatulog siya habang nakikinig ng "an empty you" sa walkman niya.  nagising na lang uli siya nung gitna ng next track "my silver chair" at hinanap ang cellphone niya.  feeling naman niya, walang nagnakaw, pero di talaga niya mahanap. ayun. nilamon ng buhangin ang cellphone niya.  so he doesn't have anyone's numbers anymore. it's very important for him to get these numbers back so he can contact you all and, if you're a buzz night band, book you.   if you have played in buzz night before, or are one of allan's friends or business associates, please email Allan (ashtrayboy@hotmail.com) your contact number/information ASAP.  do it soon, kasi alam niyo namang lahat kung gaano siya ka OC at malamang mababaliw na siya in the next 24 hours kung di niya mabawi yun lahat. hehe.  thank you!

      last night was one of the most memorable BUZZ NIGHTS i ever had. a few hours before gig time, two bands backed-out giving me the idea that it would again turn out to be another "allan montero night" because three of the bands that were to perform was fronted by me  - eventhough two of which are girl fronted. it worried me a bit because some of my detractors might show up and laugh at the idea of me going up the stage three times commiting the grave sin of over-kill, over-exposure and of course being over-weight. fuck them all to hell and beyond. i really feel sorry for these people. palibhasa d nyo kaya yung nagawa, ginagawa at magagawa ko. before you criticize me for doing the things i do with regards to buzz nights or any other gig for that matter, look at yourself and ask if you can do even just 10% of what i can do. mga chong wala pa kayo sa kalingkingan ko. its a good thing that none of these shitheads showed up last night.  going back to what happened last night, the gig started out late dew to the rain. i was expecting a really heavy turn-out based on text messages i received, most of which were anonymous texters but maybe most of them might've thought that españa was already flooded. still the turn-out was quite good. new faces galore!!!   5 minutes to 11 and the first band to play was  superminty . a band which i front. based on the response from the crowd - none of whom were our friends, and the way we felt on stage, i can say the we played very well. i saw some people on the brink of dancing during our set. who could ever argue, when a band plays 5 yet-to-be-heard originals with which at its early state can already be called "classics". next to go up stage was a new band called  blue stellar . so new that it was obviuos that this band don't have the slightest idea of what to sound like. their first song did hint of an almost decent indiepop tune that could've sent spring boutique to do an early re-union gig just to re-establinsh themselves at the forefront of that tired genre.  after that song, it was all downhill for them. i like the keyboardist, i hope i could get her to play for one of my bands. hehehe. the singer on the other hand should try to capture the proper voice that would fit whatever genre they would later decide to push through with. some of my friends commented that she's like a singer of a showband when she moves on stage, to me okey lang kasi bagay naman at hindi overdone. the guitarist on the otherhand shows a lot of promise if they were to choose the indie genre but there are times that he'd dish out cliche' stuff. the drummer and the bassist compliment each other quite well.  candyaudioline  (another one of my bands) followed... do i need to say more... okey, as usual another great set for us. what made this set far more better was the fact that we were complete again and we did two songs which we haven't played for quite a long time now. we even gave in to a request from a foreigner who wanted to know what my bloody valentine sound like because he liked the "city girl" song by kevin shields off that "lost in translation" movie. we were all in high spirits that night that we forgot to talk about ayn's future with candyaudioline. how i'd wish she could've chosen another course that would still allow her ample time to be in a band.   tether  followed they played a great set. very tight indeed. the songs grow on you. every member save for the singer is an ace. the twin guitar attack reminded me of an early 90's shoegaze band called curve and sometimes helmet. heavy talaga pero it doesn't rock in a rock and roll way. think of yatsura or beatnik filmstars na mas accessible tapos girl yung singer. the bassist and the drummer is as tight as it can get. yung drummer punung-puno ng attitude pag pumapalo. wala ginagaya. the vocalist is quite a good singer but she has to step up to her bandmates' growing desire for volume. sabi ng girlfriend ko "paganda sya ng paganda yung singer ng tether" ang sabi ko naman "oonga eg. pati na rin yung tugtugan nila. that's tether for you, habang tumatagal, paganda ng paganda... Buzz Night poster boys, and self proclaimed maniacs  popular days  followed next. jaw-dropping-awesome was the best way to describe their set... they were so relaxed that night that they seemed to take control of the whole venue. even the waiters were put to a standstill. special mention goes to bogsy who has really improved on his drumming skills. all of their songs came out splendid thanks to his steadiness. popular days has already found their own sound, sings with their own voice, uses their own beats. the only thing that they've yet to achieve is to get the respect from their own scene. sadly, this is a scene dominated by people who admire bands which sounds-like other foreign bands they admire... yuck!!! tapos galit pa sila sa mga showbands, ang kakapal talaga ng mukha!!!  soft pillow kisses  - another band of mine - came next. the crowd was about to leave while we were setting up. good thing that it rained hard that time so they had no choice but to stay and go through our set. to my surprise, we did give them the best set of the night... on stage it was like magic. everything was falling into its proper places. it was like year 2001 again but this time it was far better. the guitars glided like swans over a shallow lake, the bass was like a happy unicorn bouncing up and down everywhere, the drums was like a heart beating frantically at the thought of a new found love for the same sex... i even dedicated the last song to all the people who stayed who stayed during our entire set... after several months of questiong myself as to the real condition of ths band, i can truly say that soft pillow kisses is back!!! the last band to play was  weedisneys .  inspite of my being exhausted already i was able to notice that they weren't really up to it. but still they carried on, one member was absent which somehow compromised their sound. still i admire them for being there no matter what. hindi sila namimili ng situation. theyr'e willing to play kahit wala nang tao or kahit sobrang aga pa... that's a band who truly deserves respect...  so why was it memorable then? maybe because it truly was an "all montero night" after all...

       Errata   Hoy excuse me ha… hindi accurate yung pagportray mo sakin sa isang scene diyan! I wasn’t asking you to be admitted so I could manyak you. I was actually hinting at manyakan to convince you to stay at the hospital so you could get the proper medical attention! It was a tool, nothing more. Hehehe.   Appendix   Allan forgot to talk about one scene there, but I guess only  I  could properly portray it because I saw everything.  Allan was still talking to the doctor with bigote about the consequences of foregoing confinement when the nurse came in to give him his anti-tetanus shots.  He gave Allan the one for the left arm, which immediately stopped Allan in mid-sentence.  He slapped his hand to his face and muttered a withering, “Oooowwooww aray…”  That shot obviously left him weakened, but he still tried to talk to the doctor.  Unfortunately, it was such a curious thing to see him wilting at the needle’s mercy that the doctor and I couldn’t help but fall silent and watch just as the nurse jabbed it into Allan’s right arm.  All Allan’s attempts to distract himself were for naught and he felt the pain.  He heaved big, whimpering sighs.  The nurse rubbed Allan’s arm.  “Masakit ba? Hindi naman eh.” He left.  The scene instantly reminded me of patronizing pediatricians of early childhood.  The big ones fall the hardest, don’t they? ;)  Needless to say, against mine and the doctors’ wishes, Allan chose to take his antibiotics orally.  Ahwuhwuh nuhmaahhhn!

      It’s been a long time since I’ve rushed myself to a hospital.  Last night, I had to because of my swollen leg which we later found out was cellulitis.  Upon entering the ER of UDMC, we were a bit surprised to find out how cool, accommodating and GAY the staff of UDMC was. To the point that the only nervous people inside the room were a half me and Selena.  Grabe kami lang ata yung tao dun.  I’m going to put down a number of memorable conversations that me, Selena and the doctors had.  Me: Doc, delikado ba ang lagay ko? Doc With Bigote: (Taas ng kilay sabay ngiwi ala Tito Sotto) …  *  Selena: Allan, magpa-injection ka na para mas mabilis yung epekto ng gamut! Me: (terrified sabay tingin sa doctor) Doc, saan niyo ba ako tuturukan? Doc In Yellow shirt na kamukha ng isang member ng Side A: (papikitpikit ng mata with a very gay smile) Eh di saan pa, eh di sa puwet!  Kasi left and right arm na yung anti tetanus mo eh wala ka nang ibang pagtuturukan pa.  *  Me: Doc, ano ba yung mga di ko pupuwedeng kainin? DIY: Kailangan mo pa bang kumain?  *  Me: Doc, may TV ba sa mga kuwarto in case magpapa admit ako? DIY:  Meron, pero di siya flat screeeen.  *  Selena: (mangiyakngiyak) Allan, pa-admit ka na!  Pramis, sasamahan kita (sabay ngiti na parang may ibig sabihin) Me: (hirap na hirap ang damdamin) SeLEEHNaaah! Mahirap yun. Nakadextrose ako. Selena: Kaya yan.  *  Me: Doc, ok lang naman po siguro kung di ako magpapa admit ngayon, diba? DWB: (pilantik ng kamay, sabay irap ng mata from right to left at mataray na sinabing)  Aba, bahala ka, basta pumirma ka ng waiver. Selena: (concerned)  Oo, Allan, kailangan pa ng waiver. Paadmit ka na para wala na, baka kung ano mangyari sayo! Me: (naiiyak sa takot) Eh dati pa naman ako Waver eh! (sabay Bagets dance gesture)   In all honesty, I really wanted to be admitted to the hospital because I was alarmed as to what I was feeling last night: slight fever, swollen leg, painful area on the leg which was very annoying and scary. If it were not for the Buzz Night gig the next day which might be one of the last two gigs of one candymember and that Subic gig for Kamikazee on Sunday.  Another reason why I opted not to go was because of the expenses I might incur.  The medicine I bought last night would have enabled me to buy a car (joke). Kidding aside, I really wanted to be at Buzz Night today because I will be playing in 3 bands, bands which have not been playing quite seriously for the past few months because of the availability of the members.  I’m looking forward to see old friends and meet new friends tonight. I’m also thinking of inviting the doctors tonight, but I know they’re busy giving their brand of caring A1 sevrice and gay humor to our sick brothers and sisters in that little area of Rotonda in Quezon City.  Godspeed to them.  Bless their souls.  If all the doctors in the world were like them, all the patients would find easy cure for their sickness and all the hospitals in the world would be colored pink.  I would like to commend the Doctor in Yellow for being so kind and funny. I don’t know if it was intentional but just the same I found it very relaxing and it helped me think positively about my health. Also I would like to thank the Doc na may Bigote for being so malakas ang dating and sincere (facial expressions pa lang, alam mo nang nanganganib na ang buhay mo!).

      hi, candymates!  so you guys weren't expecting this... i changed the blog template because i'm a little tired of the old look. i wanted something pink, but i was afraid you guys would object, so here it is... blue and cool on the eyes.  ok, ok... it may be a little ordinary, but hey--- it's a TEMPLATE, isn't it? ;D anyway, the cool thing about this blog is that it may look ordinary, but the content is out of this world!  we make it that way.   so post away, my friends.  p.s.  di na daw tuloy yung june 12 kasi may ibang gig na linagay on that date. shucks!

      first of all, i would like thank God for an answered prayer...  to all those who were there, the bands, the paying crowd and the management and staff of freedom bar, thanks... ang mahal nga lang ng ice tea... and to the sound system that provided the extra cymbals and amps(kahit bumigay pa yung bass amp - trace elliot pa naman , salamat din sana huwag nyo na ako pagbayarin... hehehe...  it was quite a successful gig that yours truly organized (with the help of my better-half/bandmate Selena and my bandmate and soon to be lawyer Ayn) last night at freedom bar. half of the line-up were already in the venue by 9:30pm which made it easy for me to decide on who plays first, second and so on. also there were walk-ins (paying crowds) which i did not really expect because of the very short preparation and very chaotic situations and events that transpired leading to the culmination of the said gig...   first band to play was  5leavesleft , they played some tagalog songs that i found quite likable (tumatanda na talaga ako). their music reminds me of a loose "Catholic Education" era teenage fanclub meets dinosaur jr w/o the masturbatory guitar excess... second band to play was  bagetsafonik . me and selena saw a poster of them outside calling their sound "GJ" which means groovy jologs. d naman... listening to them outside (i was also the gatekeeper that night) reminded me of radial spangle and mercury rev. they played a great set last night marred only by the cajon sound which i found quite manipis (sorry i wasn't to help you guys out with the sound, alam nyo naman, gatekeeper? next time i will.) one band to watch out for... next band was ehem  candyaudioline . as usual ang lupit nila este namin. to those who weren't able to witness the awesome power of this band live eh sorry nalang kayo. you don't know what you're missing pero d pa naman huli ang lahat...  tenderpiss   followed which disappointed me a bit because they didn't turn out as what Ayn described them to be. although they have good tunes that need to be polished a bit more and maybe they just have to learn when turn the volume down...  weedisneys  followed next because they made singit using vice mayorial tactics to scare the band who was suppose to play next to tenderpiss. armed with expensive bandware, a very beautiful "weekehnwacker" guitar and a brand new haircut, vice mayor and company dished out walls of oceanic guitar noise accompanied by throbbing basslines and a steady beat. for a second there i was reminded of sonnet58 but when the singing started i finally came back to my senses. great songs the longer the sweeter it gets. save for one snappy song that they did which i also liked a bit its just that i couldn't hear the vocal melody of the song... last band to play was  tether  (one of my current fave band) really great songs especially the last two songs. they've really improved a lot. another band to set your eyes and ears on...  there you go... a little info on what transpired last night... see you next time if there will still be a next time... by the way, BUZZ NIGHT will be on the 22nd of may...

      Happy Birthday to our super excellent guitarist Ralph Romero :)  Today is his birthday but he chose to celebrate it last Friday to catch the last few hours before the liquor ban began (due to the presidential elections).  Incidentally, former candyaudioline vocalist Mitch Dulce also chose to celebrate her birthday in advance that night--- Happy Birthday, Kumareng Mitch.  Unfortunately, Ayn was in Tarlac for a Matilda gig.  Allan and I arrived promptly at Ralph's at 8 pm.  Ralph asked us if Roel was coming and we looked at each other and said, oops.  We thought Ralph had already informed him and Ralph said that he had assumed we'd disseminate the info.  Oh well, so I texted Roel around five times that night asking him to come over to Ralph's, but I guess he didn't get the message as he failed to drop by.  That was such a pity because Ralph had a whole lechon and tons of other food ready for the consumption of candyaudioKAIN and its glutton friends.   Menu: Lechon Inihaw na Panga (tuna) Pancit Bihon Lumpiang Shanghai Fruit Salad Fresh Fruits (mango, atis, durian) Cake Durian Ice Cream  I honestly think I'm missing something--- that was how much food there was.  It was made through the combined efforts of Charmaine and their neighbors.  There were drinks, too--- lots of soda and beer.  Allan and I were the only band friends to grace the celebration, plus Gab… the rest of them were Ralph's and Charmaine's officemates and colleagues.  We were sure that if Ayn, Roel and Charles had only come, they'd have a great time, too.  As it was, Allan and I just had a good, long talk with Ralph (the first in a really long time) and caught up with his new lifestyle.  First of all, we told Ralph how his non-reply to all our text messages about gigs was contributing to Allan's risks for heart failure.  He promised that he'd reply, even if very late (he's been asleep at odd hours due to his newfound work freedom so he keeps missing our messages).  We talked about Allan's plans for our album (see, it's in the works :D) and also what's been happening to us these days with Charles sessioning for us.  He told us about his work and his plans with Charmaine concerning their upcoming union and the birth of their baby.  Ralph still looks tired, but definitely much happier.  Gab arrived and we talked some more, then Ralph showed us the website he was working on for Gab and his wife's wedding last December.  What can I say?  It's another kickass site.  It's still under construction, though.  While we were surfing, Allan fell asleep on Ralph's bed.  He seemed really tired.  Ralph and Gab went downstairs already, but I could only wake Allan up half an hour after that.  Gab had already left.  Buti nga nagising pa siya eh.  Ralph let us watch in his living room a DVD of "Couplings" (a British "Sex and the City", but funnier) which Allan had borrowed. After that, we sat around the food table with Charmaine, Ralph and their neighbors to chat.  It was tempting to get more food, but we were both too full by that time.  In the end, they had to chop up the lechon to give away to the remaining guests (each one got to take home about 2 pounds!).  We opted instead to take home some durian and frozen panga. Mmmm.  Ralph brought us to the gate, where something slightly disturbing happened, what with elections coming around the bend.  A group of young boys were running in the streets chased by a car.  Some of them hid; one of them supposedly ran into Ralph's compound to hide. The car had driven past without finding them. It was all so frantic and we had no idea what was the cause behind it.  After a while, the other boys came to retrieve the lost one, saying, "Wala na sila. Labas ka na!" and they all disappeared.  The incident made me jittery the rest of the way home.  Tomorrow night, we'll be having a gig at Freedom Bar.  Ralph will be playing. Yay :)  A great reunion.

      I remember the first time I saw him was when Ayn and I brought Allan to his house.  He told us to wait so that he could show Milenyo to us.  He brought Milenyo out on a leash and the dog was sniffing all over and jumping excitedly.  When Allan brought him to the door of Ayn's van, he almost jumped inside and I was so nervous.  Ayn was all, "Awww, doggie, doggie!" and I was, "Ay, cute nga siya---  get him away from me ."  Allan was so proud of his dog.  He laughed at the fact that I was afraid of him.  "Ang bait-bait nga niya, eh!"  Sometimes, habang nagtetelebabad kami dati ni Allan, kinukwentuhan niya ako tungkol kay Milenyo, but I wasn't really interested because I didn't care much for dogs (since I knew they didn't care much for ME, either!).  Once, while Allan and I were talking, he suddenly started shouting in disgust.    "Ano??? Bakit?? Ano'ng nangyari??"  "YAAAAAAAAK!!!  N***b***n si Milenyo sa braso kohhh!!!!! AAAAHHH!!!"  I laughed so hard, but for the life of me, I could not fathom how something like that could happen.  I couldn't picture it in my mind.  Then again, who would want to?  Allan used to tell me that Milenyo liked to kiss him while he was sleeping.  I thought it was something like you see on TV where owners give their pets pecks on their noses.  He said it was much worse than that.  I didn't really believe him.  I finally got to meet Milenyo one-on-one, face-to-face last October when I went to Allan's house to view his downloaded videos.  I talked about that in one blog entry.  He barked and barked at me through the screen, perched on the sofa like a weird cat and I clung to Allan's shirt and whispered over and over through clenched teeth, "Don't let him jump on me, don't let him jump on me."  I kept remembering how frisky he was that first time in Ayn's van.  But after an eager sniffing, he deemed me harmless enough to calm down, so I was finally able to relax.  Later, he put his head on me knee and looked up at me with doe eyes so that I just had to say, "Awww," and pet him.  He seemed to like me.  When Allan and I got together, and I started to go to his house more often, Milenyo would always greet me the same way.  At first, I was still nervous, but then I realized that he was just excited that Allan was home and that he had brought his pretty visitor (hehe, joke lang ;) with him.  Once, I was watching TV while Allan was catching some much needed sleep on the sofa, snoring away, when the strangest thing happened.  Milenyo went up to him and started licking Allan's lips.  Eeew, I know. I thought the same thing.  But I figured, "Hey, they probably have this special kind of relationship," so I didn't mind it much.  Then, I noticed that Milenyo's tongue was practically inside Allan's mouth.  Oh gawd. Yes, I know, I know. Uggghhhh!  And to think those are the lips I kiss (that in itself is something not many people like to imagine, either, hahaha). EEEwwwwrrgGGHHH!  At first, I would swat Milenyo away with a "No, Milenyo!" but in 3 seconds, he'd be back at Allan's lips, licking away lovingly.  I tried waking up Allan, too, but that's even more of a Herculean effort.  In time, everything seemed so futile that I just let the two lovebirds be.  Allan would wake up bugnot and I'd say, "Milenyo kissed you, you know."  "Talaga?? Ba't hindi mo siya pinigilan?? Yaak!"  "Hello! Ang hirap kaya!  I even tried waking you up, but that didn't work, either."  He'd slump dejectedly in his seat and say, "Napanaginipan ko pa naman na kini-kiss kita. Hay naku!!" We would discuss from time to time whether Milenyo was gay or not. Such was that admirable canine's devotion to his master.  Allan told me once about the time that Milenyo actually followed Mrs. Montero out up to the LRT station.  She was in a dilemma because, on one hand, she had to leave immediately, and on the other, she couldn't leave him there.  Fortunately, Joey (candyaudioline circa '98) just stepped off the LRT and was on his way home.  She begged him to bring Milenyo back to their house.  So Joey had no choice but to hoist him up onto his shoulders and carry him like a goat all the way back to Allan's house.  It was so weird to see Milenyo up on Joey's shoulders like that, Allan recalled.  Last New Year's Eve, Milenyo barked and growled at Ralph, whom he had seen very little of.  But when the fireworks started, he hid under the table or cowered beside Allan's leg all night.  Milenyo, for all his quirks, was a very good dog. I don't like dogs, but if I'll ever have one, I'd want it to be like Milenyo.  He was always the first to know if Allan's brother was going to have an attack.  He used to wait up for Allan all night 'til he came home from a gig.  He would bark at intruders, but once he knew you were a friend, he'd behave well around you and even come up for a pat on the head.  He shit and pissed where he was supposed to and took care never to dirty the floor, although he was known to chew some things to shreds in his lifetime (casualties include several cellular phones, a thousand peso bill, and a walkman).  When he got sick, we were all worried about him.  He wouldn't eat.  He became very thin.  His bark was no longer deep and full but weak and high-pitched.  He slunk around the house instead of bounding to and fro. He never stopped trying to wag his tail, though.  They brought him to a vet, who diagnosed him with pneumonia, worms and an eye infection.  They gave him medicine, and he improved slightly, but he eventually lapsed back into deterioration.  One night, while Allan and I were at the computer, he shit on the floor and convulsed.  We were shocked at how far gone he was.  He looked like a dog who, having found himself incontinent, had finally lost his canine dignity.  It was heartbreaking to see him like that.  His death was unceremonious.  He had passed away early in the morning; Allan's older brother had tearfully broken the news to him.  They couldn't bury him in the tiny plot of land in their compound so they had no choice but to give his body to the garbage truck when it passed.  It seemed an irreverent end to a noble life.  Last Sunday was the first time I went to Allan's after the death of Milenyo.  It was strange not to have Milenyo sniffing around me as I walked through the door, but his recent sickness had put an end to that habit weeks before and I had already gotten used to it.  I didn't think much of Milenyo's absence at first; perhaps, in the back of my mind, I thought he was going to reappear out of hiding suddenly, like he was still playing a game with us.  But then, I remembered that he wasn't going to come up to me for a rub ever again and I felt a distinct empty feeling in the air.

      Obviously, the greatest obstacle to playing in a band such as Candyaudioline is living life.  We do such different things that it's so difficult to match schedules and activities where everyone can have a good time and/or do what we love to do best: play.  I'd like to examine how these circumstances came to be and hopefully, achieve some catharsis on this matter.  I know that one of our greatest frustrations these days is that we can't get together and play… we don't really like talking about it because it seems all the more futile when we do.  Well, let's see.  When this line-up was formed in summer of 2002, Ayn and I were still at school, Allan and Roel were already working at their current jobs (Backbeat Management), and Ralph was a skilled peon at some web design company in Makati.  Obviously, Ayn and I had freer, more fixed schedules that were easy to match, even as we were finishing our respective theses.  Allan and Roel had flexible schedules, though many a gig had to be cancelled due to the unpredictable nature of such a schedule (sudden gigs, etc.).  Ralph was… I don't know. I guess he had less work then and I think he was starting to hate his job, which made it easier for him to nix a work night in favor of a gig hehehe.  All these explain how easy it was for us then to play so many dates without having a real schedule for gigs like other bands did.  Most of it was usually spur-of-the-moment; Allan would just text us all on the same date, "Uy, may tugtog tayo mamaya sa ____," and we'd all just show up. I think the only real roadblock back then to our availability as a band was when Ayn got pregnant, but even that was assuaged by a sub-bassist named Sonia and then later on by Ayn herself when she realized she wanted to keep playing in the band right until a few days before her due date.  I remember that time that we were all scared she'd suddenly go into labor in the middle of "Wicked Glances" or something freaky like that.  Then, I graduated.  But I was out of work for a long time.  Ralph also quit his job.  We were basically just raring to go play all the time because it got even easier to drop everything for a gig.  We also started going out together more often.  With our bosom buddies from Popular Days, we did everything together, from watching the latest movies to eating at our favorite Pares or Kebab places, to videoke at Nymphet'z and movie marathons/drinking sprees at Ayn's house.  This was the height of our closeness as a band, I think.  I eventually found work, but its flexibility enabled me to keep performing even with all the late nights.  Then, Allan and I got together and bonding became even easier.  But then, Ralph found work at a more prestigious (but stingy) web company in Eastwood.  That was the beginning of extended periods of rest for the band.  His work became very demanding to the point that he disappeared for days at a time without answering our texts.  I think I must have posted about 2 "Where's Ralphyyyyyy???" entries in the past 6 months hehehe.  He was just swamped at work.  Meanwhile, so were Allan and Roel, with all the Backbeat gigs during Christmas and School Fair season.  Schedules were becoming more difficult to match, and soon Ayn was having a problem, too, because she was preparing for graduation and for law school.  This gave Allan time to concentrate on his other bands, Soft Pillow Kisses and Superminty.  It was a good thing that we had at least finished our album recording by the first quarter of the year because things became even more desperate.  Ralph quit his job again and decided to make it as a freelance web designer.  With the news of Charmaine's pregnancy, he needed to raise some money-- and fast!-- so he decided to concentrate on all his rackets for the benefit of his future child.  Roel was also promoted to being a Parokya roadie; i.e., he had more gigs to go to and less time on his hands.  Ayn was waiting for law school to start and she worriedly kept asking for us to take advantage of summer to play or practice because she knew how trapped she was going to be in law school come June.  I, on the other hand, was still at my same humble job, frantically thinking on ways for the band to balance its time.  So was Allan, but he found a way for us to take advantage of the last week of May by booking us over the weekend for several gigs. Yahoo.  Except that he suddenly had to be hospitalized for his leg. All those gigs were cancelled.  And here we are. Still waiting.  The few times we get together are so precious.  We can only do it two or three at a time, but each instance is a momentous event, like that time Allan and I stumbled upon Ayn at Rockwell.  Or when Roel, Allan and I see each other at Backbeat events and talk about "the next gig".  Or yesterday, when Allan, Roel and I met Ralph and Charmaine at the Parokya DVD shoot in Makati.  The two met me at Shopwise and relayed Allan's message to buy him a shirt (the one he was wearing was dirty from hauling props around).  Charmaine really looks like a mother now with her extra weight.  I hastily picked out a gray, triple XL Crispa shirt, knowing very well that Allan wouldn't fit in it, and watched Ralph and Charmaine paying for their baby stuff in the next checkout line.  Later, at the studio, we sat around in monobloc chairs and someone commented on Charmaine's pregnancy.  "Pare, kami na lang ni Selena ang walang anak sa banda!"  "Gumawa na kayo," Ralph said.  I suddenly remembered Ayn and Tristania so I texted Ayn about Ralph and Charmaine being at the shoot, if she wanted to have a reunion. Regretfully, she replied that it was too far and that she had an exam she had to study for the next day; she said she would try to make it up to us and that she was sorry we always had to adjust to her. I said she shouldn't mention it because we care about her and we admire the fact that she's working so hard.  "Basta usually free ako pag Friday," she said, "Kung may balak kayo…"  This, I relayed to Allan and he said that he'd try to get us dates on Fridays.  We all miss it, dammit.  But this was certainly a spark of hope.  Later, while we were watching the shooting, Roel confided to me that he was excited to use the new cymbals and snare he had acquired recently.  I think the enthusiasm in his voice was not in the least due to the alcohol that tainted his breath.  I think playing in Candyaudioline again is on his mind a lot, too.  The fact is that there is no life outside the band for us.  We may not be able to play as often as we could before, but the band itself figures largely in each of our lives, whether we like it or not. It's infused with our separate existences; it is the golden thread that binds the web designer, the road manager, the law student, the roadie and the editorial assistant.

      Allan and William picked me up at home at around 9:45 because I had to lug the keyboard around.  We arrived at Mayric's at around 10 and found the first band, Irony, setting up.  They played a good round of noisy tunes, Weedisneys-ish (which wasn't a surprise as both bands had similar roots in Fin) and loud and melodic.  After three songs, they suddenly said their set was over, which prompted Allan to tell Charles to tell them they could play another one.  This apparently caught them off guard and they debated for a few moments on a good song to play.  They settled on one, sang it, then finished their set with another Thank You.  They had to leave soon after because they had another gig to go to somewhere else.  I think they were happy they got to play at Buzz Night again.  The Manyaks were at Mayric's before the gig started, but they weren't going to play as Popular Days because Eric supposedly couldn't make it and Ian didn't show up.  Eric was at work where he was just going to start his nightshift.  Charles told us he was thinking of cutting work because a certain band was going to play (ahem), but he convinced Eric to go or he'd face the consequence of losing his job.  Lara came in holding a bunch of pink, peach and yellow daisies, which she picked from a wedding to which she had gone.  She put them in our hair, the guys' lapels and we dumped the rest in a used glass to grace our table headquarters with their prettiness.  Blue Stellar then took the stage with one less member.  Who should step through the doors of Mayric's but one Ericho Lucas, flushed from a dash from the office? Shouts of disbelief greeted his "they suddenly called off work tonight" speech.   The Blue Stellar vocalist had to play the bass while singing. For some reason, this did not diminish their appeal but increased it. I admit that I'm not exactly the best believer-slash-practitioner of the soft and laid back school of indie singing (oh, man, I sound like Boy Abunda in "Star Circle Quest"… eew) because, well, my voice is naturally big and also, my formative years were spent listening to your run-of-the-mill rock songs, where emotional wailing is the way to go… however, this subdued singing really fit their type of music better than the way she used to sing before.  Lara, daisy tucked behind her ear, large dark glasses and serene smile on her face, commented, "Ok sila ah."  Allan said the band improved since last Buzz Night.  I agreed, but there were some songs where the off-key guitars jarred my senses.  At first, it seemed like it was out of tune, but then Allan thought that it must have been intentional like the weird chords that he sometimes does.  Hmmm… I think it didn't work on some songs though, but I'll let everyone else be the judge of that.  Next, a new band, Kneel On Nails performed.  They had told Allan that their music was emocore/post-melodic, and when I first heard that, I asked Allan what it sounded like.  He said it would sound something like Ronald Schlander's band (I still had no idea).  So he booked them. Anyway, they came on. I thought they were ok, but I raised a brow when I heard them roaring.  "Hindi, ok lang yan. At least iba yung pagka-emo nila."  Well, after their set, he asked if they wanted to front for a Backbeat event, so one good thing came out of that.  Then, Superminty performed.  We played the staples well, but decided to insert "Little Nothings" into our set, even if we weren't sure we'd gotten it already.  Thankfully, we played that very well, too :)  I was especially proud of myself because I had been having a hard time practicing the keyboards for that song and during the performance I managed to get by without one mistake.  Sunset Drive then performed their comeback to Buzz Night.  It was great to see these guys again because their sets are always so tight and they sound really good.  Hopefully, they'll grace Buzz Nights to come.  They were so good that night that there's nothing more I can say.  An old Buzz Night band, Easy Mercy (sorry, spell check… I remember reading a different spelling on the Mayric's white board) performed next their 60's music.  The Beatle-esque harmonies were refreshing and their little stops and starts endeared them to the audience.  It's interesting how a low-fi set-up can still tweak our pleasure knobs every now and then… I had gotten so used to waves of hypnotic guitars in the past months.  Finally, Soft Pillow Kisses ended the night with a 6-song set. I had to sub for Luie because she couldn't make it.  I got to sing "It Will Never Last (Forever)"-- I begged them to let me-- and it was the highlight of my short stint as SPK vocalist, even if I flubbed some high parts hehehe.  Lara and I sang the last song, "Bathing in the Sun", together and I think we blew everyone's minds with that.  And that's how the night ended: brains leaking out of people's ears, people whose last thoughts before the ecstasy of death were, "Oh, maaaaaaannnn, this is gooooooood…"  I  thought  the floor was a little stickier to the soles of our shoes that night.

I think I'll talk about it some other time.

      SPK had a wonderful set last night fronting for Parokya at 70's Bistro. They started at 10:30 pm (late for 70's Bistro... the manager was fretting madly) with the long-missed song "vodka ice #3" which made me cry. other songs were "stay here for a while", "i was right" and "bathing in the sun". a very short but very sweeeeeeeeeeet set.  we weren't able to eat out as usual because lara and i had to go home early, but it was great seeing everyone again. you know, it's great how pillow can sing their old songs impromptu, even without practice. it reminds us why we admired this band in the first place. we should try doing that when we play together again :) look how stupendous we were last buzz night with "broken to pieces" even with some minor flubs hehehe. we shouldn't be afraid of little slipups like that because they make us all the more human and, therefore, adorable ;)  anyway, wonderful set. i'm sure it left a lot of people sighing in their seats last night.

      Last night, to celebrate our *ehem* monthsary, Allan and I decided to go malling somewhere else for a change hehehe. Ahwuhwuh nuhmun-- monthsary na nga lang, sa mall pa pumunta!  We decided to go to Power Plant instead of our usual SM fetish.  On the Santolan Overpass, we suddenly realized that we should have gone to Klub 102 because then we could have had good sounds and reminisced the early days of our relationship when we used to go to the Makati incarnation of the new wave club; plus, the new one in Quezon City is nearer.  But then, we decided that going back to Klub 102 meant that we'd stay up really late, when Allan had planned to be home early to fix some domestic problems of his.    We entered the mall at around 9 and were dismayed to find that it was about to close, too.  We decided to eat at Dulcinea after roaming the basement and we had an iffy dinner of salad, baked lasagna, a ham and cheese sandwich and fries, and lots of churros.  We started feeling really queasy with our full stomachs and dissatisfied palates, and the trash guy at the restaurant was making loud comments about Salbakuta and Vendetta, obviously aiming them at us.  Allan kept mumbling under his breath, "Nakakaawa ka lang, eh… nakakaawa ka lang, eh…" and managed to control his murderous urges.  It really was offensive because we were customers at the restaurant (a very reputable one at that) and the guy wasn't making much of an effort to joke discreetly. Oh well, another day in the life of Allan Montero. Blood on knuckles isn't good for holding hands.  Allan remembered Ayn because we were in Rockwell and I had casually mentioned her name--- he texted her, "Nasa Rockwell kami at naalala ka namin kasi namimiss ka na namin."  To our surprise she called us and said she was still in Rockwell at that hour; her classes for that week were from 6 to 9. What luck! We decided to meet her outside and, since she hadn't had dinner yet, accompany her while she ate.  We settled down at Gram's Diner and Ayn told us about her first experiences in law school.  I was very intimidated by the people she seemed to be exposed to; I decided that I could never fit in an environment like that myself.  Allan also talked about his misadventures with some of the Backbeat Bands from long before… I think it started from a discussion about that shroom segment on Jessica Soho Reports.  We kept laughing there in the drizzle of rain and enjoyed each other's company.  Finally, it was time to go because Allan had to get home and Ayn had to, well, study!  Her parents had brought Trista with them, but she was so deep in her oily sleep that no matter how much we pinched or poked her, she wouldn't wake. It was really great meeting up like that, so serendipitous, and we're hoping that we'd get to have Ayn play again with us soon.

      Guys, nominate  urlLink Ralph's personal website!!!!!  Siguradong panalo!!!! His site/blog will kick the asses of all those other nominees (including ours) all the way to Zimbabwe.   (pero baka naman over-qualified).   Obiter Dictum ...  I read this from the Blog Awards website, re: rules.   2. Your blog site should  not focus  on pure adult materials, illegal stuff and  pure hate related content .   (1) Adult materials - Nymphets (though we weren't that detailed) (2) Illegal stuff - Hmmm... uh... hmmm... nah, we're all clean ;) (3) Pure hate related content--  --Dudes, we had  it  "saved."  *wink wink*  Ooops! Silly me.  I never learn, do I?   Ha ha :)   Oh yeah, that was for "entertainment" purposes  only  I reckon.

      this will sound really really funny but--- our blog has been nominated in the  urlLink Philippine Blog Awards 2004 . haha! i came across it accidentally while i was surfing.  but to whoever nominated us, thanks :) what were you thinking? did you perhaps think that the content alone qualified us for the award? but, hey, we're truly honored... it was just so funny to stumble on the info like that.  a postscript to the superminty news last entry: 2 people thought we played very well. one guy, who was drunk, said, "put*ngina, ang galing niyo, pare," over and over again. and he said he wanted to clap but he felt too shy because no one else was hahaha. and another girl asked if we were soft pillow kisses but allan said we were a different band and she said, "you guys are great!"  :D

      yep, here we are, lying low. can't help it. a lot of obstacles have come our way in terms of time and money, but at least the desire is still there. i heard roel suggested a practice the other night. if only we could.  about the album, don't worry. when allan finally gets up the nerve, he's going to submit it somewhere. at least it's finished, save for the mastering. kaya yan.  last night, superminty (a band i have also missed) played to front for parokya at mayric's with popular days and it was really great to see everyone again. :)  allan tells me that buzz night is on the 26th.  see you around...

       Aba. Ang ganda na ng posting interface ng Blogger. Pwede na akong mag-  fancy font  . Astig.   &nbsp;   Buzz Night is on the 31st at Mayric's, 10 pm.     &nbsp;   we may or may not play.     &nbsp;  Please stand by for more information.  &nbsp;  ***  &nbsp;   As a follow-up to my last post, though not related to   Candyaudioline   and of a more personal nature, I sang last night for Pillow at 70's Bistro and have improved my singing. I took my recent observations to heart. There was some lyrics confusion with "Wasting", but it was laughed off. The instrumental part of "Bathing" was so fun that it reminded me of another shoegaze band very dear to our hearts. Three separate people asked the name of the band after we had left the stage.   &nbsp;  Then Allan, Charles and I went to Mayric's for Kamikazee/Moonstar work.  &nbsp;

      The other night, I sang for Soft Pillow Kisses at Altered Native in Fairview.  I hate singing at that venue (but it's a good place to listen to music while hanging out with friends, and the staff is nice).  They have a deceptive sound system there.  The monitors make you think you're singing at a good level when in fact you can't be heard from the rear of the restaurant. Sure enough, when Allan sang that first song alone, I barely heard him from where I was standing.  And when I approached the stage, I suddenly realized that Lara was singing, too! Shit. I knew I was going to have a tough time. I was pissed and I sang as if I was pissed (imagine Soft Pillow Kisses on steroids).  It was crappy, but passable, I guess.  Allan described it later as me "declaiming", enunciating words, but mechanically doing so.  Allan and I hung out by the door outside and Moonstar88 finally finished their set.  These three heavyset men burst out of the bar and one of them had a sour look on his face as he said passionately, "Yung una---" He froze when he saw the two of us looking at him.  He and his friends walked away and he mumbled the rest of his comment. Allan and I burst out laughing.  "Ano kaya yung sasabihin niya dapat?"  "Ano pa? Eh di pangit!"  I laughed.  It was funny, and I don't begrudge that guy's feelings about the performance.  I really wasn't into it that night. I'm just bothered how I'm easily affected by extraneous variables during a gig while we're performing.  Like that time I got pissed at some Wuds fans because they were heckling us. I sang as if pissed that night, too. Why can't I just have grace under fire like Allan can?  I'm getting rusty. I wish we could practice. I'm not used to singing anymore. Last performance was a wake-up call for me. I'm probably taking myself too seriously, as well. Who am I proving myself to? All I need are my bandmates' approval. As long as Allan thinks the way I sing his songs are fine, then it's ok. Everything else (a good performance) follows after that. I think I'm losing touch with the original deal.  But, to be honest, I think this onstage irritability is a symptom of some deeper psychological trouble I have. I always feel indignant at whatever negative comes my way, hence, the quick reactions. I just gotta chill or something. I think that practicing would help. Just having fun playing and stuff like that, like when we did that cover for "Today".  We were supposed to practice for Superminty tonight but Charles can't make it, I think, and Allan isn't feeling well, either.  I don't know. It's weird, isn't it? It is possible to get rusty, even when all you're doing is singing.

      First, let me just say that I think you had a point there, Allan. Sometimes, we're just too puny against the established authority.  Or, we grow up.  **  Anyway, I was looking at our counter's stats and I discovered that the top languages viewing our site are the following, with corresponding hits:  English (United States) 472 Hits  English (Philippines) 44 Hits  English (United Kingdom) 4 Hits  Japanese 3 Hits  French (Belgium) 2 Hits  English (Canada) 2 Hits  Polish 2 Hits  Dutch (Belgium) 2 Hits  English (Caribbean) 2 Hits  Swedish 1 Hits  English (Australia) 1 Hits  Spanish (International Sort) 1 Hits  Italian (Italy) 1 Hits  Korean 1 Hits  I think this must mean something like these are the top languages of the OSes of visitors to the site.  Whatever the case may be, the fact that all these unexpected languages show up on the counter stats is amusing.  Here are the stats for my own blog:  English (United States) 309 Hits  English (Philippines) 89 Hits  Japanese 3 Hits  ie-ee 1 Hits  English (Caribbean) 1 Hits  English (Australia) 1 Hits  Again, how weird. And what's "ie-ee"?  Anyway, i'm sure i've misunderstood this all somehow. But it's just interesting to think, "what if?".  What if at least one Polish dude and one Caribbean guy  have  strayed here? That would be surreal. And feel free to set me straight on this, Ralph.

      "Never criticize anything in public and never build the foundation of your career by attacking a specific idea. Because if you live long enough you will inevitably come to embody the very idea that you once criticized. And everyone will know." (from ayn's last post)   there's nothing wrong with criticizing (even publicly) specially when you strongly believe that such deserves criticism. building a foundation based on a specific idea can't easily be avoided. it's the focus in that certain aspect which fuels your drive to go against what you don't agree with or annoys you in general...  now, when it comes to a point when you begin to come to terms with what you once stood against, the question that will come to mind is... "why?" there could be many reasons why oppossites come to term with one another. it could be something that merely constitute the meeting of terms which could be or could not be to one's favor, like the idea of catching up to ones standards therefore making acceptance an unavoidable circumstance.  another is a situation wherein the dictates of a certain era makes if difficult for one to avoid being sucked into a system. but it's still you who'll know if that's the situation or not...   times change and life is like a wheel so they say... yes there'll come a time that EVERYONE will know... but...  WILL THEY REALLY KNOW?   "I Know You Supported Me A Long Time... Somehow I'm Not Impressed"                           from the song "NYC" by the band INTERPOL

      This post is in connection with my last post on life outside the band. I noticed that the reasons we can't play these days are largely because our alter egos need to work overtime.  Ralph is busy earning money for his baby's birth.  Roel and Allan are busy with Backbeat gigs. Ayn is in law school and needs to put her nose to the grindstone. I have family problems, though I think that, of all of us, I'm the one who has the most will and capacity to sacrifice in order to have a candyaudioline gig.  Do things like playing in a band and meeting obligations not mix?  I suppose that this is a fundamental dilemma for any band and that ours has more obstacles than the usual.  But it's not like we can just up and leave our real lives for the pursuit of a really good live show. I'm just bothered at how everything always seems to have to taper off to few-and-far-betweens.  Maybe this is always the case when a band grows older.  Other obligations just have to be prioritized, especially because most of us still want to lead normal, healthy lives (in terms of having a family and financial security).  When I wasn't a member of candyaudioline yet, my impression of the band scene was that it was very limited, that there were only a few bands left from the early 90's Pinoy "band explosion".  Once I scratched the surface upon joining candyaudioline, I realized that this scantiness was due to matters of exposure, and that there were actually dozens of talented bands who weren't getting airplay or any other means of presenting their work.  This was very enlightening, and I felt privileged to watch productions like Buzz Night and other smaller ones that had rosters of amazing but unheard-of bands.  I realized how very small my perception of Filipino music used to be.  But after some time, I noticed that I kept seeing the same faces all the time, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, of course.  I just discovered how finite the band scene still was, although a little bigger than what I first perceived it to be.  And the more I got a sense of how finite it was, the more I noticed that it wasn't even stable, but that the number of bands was actually dwindling.  Great bands were stopping, breaking-up, reforming as something else and then breaking-up again, all because of shifting commitments and priorities.  It's all very sad.  Well, I guess that it's just another manifestation of "survival of the fittest".  It sounds trite, but I think clichés are just so because they apply universally. The band that plays together, stays together… and all such BS.  Of course, there's always the hope that new blood will arise, bringing with them the growth of a genre and opportunities for the meeting of more minds for the greater good of the music.  So maybe this hiatus was inevitable, especially since most of us in candyaudioline are normal, everyday people (verging on the "baduy but lovable" hehehe).  Every band goes through this phase.  We just have to have faith and stick it out.  Eventually, we'll find a rhythm where we can make time for each other and go on excellent sound trips again.  Relax.  Remember that conformity is not the evil… it's  complacency and stagnation .  :D

      Something that Erick posted at the Buzznite mailing list:    We Will One Day Become That Which We Despise  Date: Thursday, June 10 @ 16:24:16 Topic From the Magazine  By Chuck Klosterman  Illustration by Nathan Fox  " Never criticize anything in public ," a semi-wise man told me as we drank absinthe in a Colorado ski lodge, " and never build the foundation of your career by attacking a specific idea. Because if you live long enough you will inevitably come to embody the very idea that you once criticized. And everyone will know ."  This is a half-truth. I've never been in a ski lodge, I've never consumed absinthe, and I'm not sure if some semi-wise man gave me this advice or if I just now made it up. The truth lies in the message. Over time, every dogmatic individual evolves into his or her ideological opposite: Anti-authority figures slowly enter the ruling class, socialists become capitalists, Fonzie grows a beard and becomes a high school shop teacher. But what happens if someone can exist only by embodying their opposite?  Nothing, I suppose. Or everything, possibly. Maybe these people are like hammerhead sharks; maybe they don't need to evolve.  I bring this up because I've noticed a curious explosion of a certain kind of rock band: groups like Franz Ferdinand, the Stills, the Killers, the Rapture, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Interpol, and roughly 900 other well-dressed collectives who generally have floppy hair and at least one excellent song (Franz Ferdinand's "Take Me Out," for example, is arguably the best rock song I've heard in two years, and the YYYs' "Maps" has become my all-time favorite track about cartography). These are generally small bands who perform to small crowds in small venues (Urge Overkill being the patient zero of this epidemic), and few of them move very many records.   Logically, these bands should represent the hyper-authentic underclass of popular music; logically, they should be cultural underdogs. But this is not the case. What these bands do best the main purpose of their existence, and the main thing people seem to like about them is embrace and embody all the signifiers of massive rock stardom. And nobody seems to realize how weird this is.  It was not long ago less than 10 years, really?that "rock star" was a negative term; if you referred to somebody as a "total rock star, "you were generally calling him or her a self-absorbed prick. This is why people loved Kurt Cobain; they loved him because he didn't seem like a rock star. That attitude changed at the very end of the 20th century. Suddenly, it was universally assumed that being an archetypal, coke-addled egomaniac was the greatest thing any artist could aspire to, apparently because our society did not have enough of these people. Today, we've reached the bizarre cultural moment when bands are adopting the trappings of superstardom without the(seemingly essential) component of being successful.  And this is not a case of groups trying to "fake it until they make it ." These are not bands who think that if they act famous they'll eventually become famous. These are bands who appear comfortable being smallish, indie-ish club acts who will never sell a million records. I suppose there is no need to be tangibly successful if you've already imagined yourself a superstar.  Certainly, this movement is not exclusive to rock and/or roll. The only television I watch is reality television, a genre whose success is measured by how accurately it reflects real life (read: good TV is anything that does not seem like TV). Nonfiction publishing has become increasingly dominated by memoirs, which are really just autobiographies by people who haven't done anything; interesting writers are people who are not necessarily interesting. The culture industry is reversing the nature of famousness.  Let's say everything about America changed overnight, and Interpol suddenly became the biggest band in the world. None of their original fans could possibly turn against them if they became eccentric, narcissistic fashionistas; that was the whole idea to begin with! If you start your career as an unsuccessful superstar in other words, if you start your career by contradicting your very essence you cannot be changed by fame. The only way Interpol could evolve would be to become multiplatinum boring dudes. And that will happen; as stated in the first paragraph, everyone eventually embodies the ideas they once criticized. And what does that mean?   It means that in the year 2008, Interpol will be the Dave Matthews Band. Buy those skinny ties now, you future frat boys of America.

      i always have this weird feeling that something not to my liking will happen to me any moment. it bothers me a lot because it has yet to happen although there are times when things do come up to me in a way that i see them as bad, it would always turn out in the end as sort or a blessing in disguise... or maybe a form of consolation. oh well, life goes on anyway so they say but that means my paranoia goes on with it as well. which isn't really a good thing for me based on the fact that because of this, my ways are a bit affected to a point wherein i can't really be myself most of the time... i've tried ignoring such thoughts but the more i ignore them the more they manifest in ways that really scares the hell out of me... for istance, i'm the type of person who enjoys loads of good times with friends and loved ones. the presence of people around me somewhat distracts me and takes away these horrible ideas and fears off my mind. but when i'm all by myself, these fears of mine creep up to me like a freezing chill on a hot summer day. when that happens i become stiff in everything. resulting in nothingness which turns out to be a terrible waste of precious oportunities and time. i become cynical to a point of not wanting to confront a certain situation or task at hand. this leads me to think and think and think not realizing that there are far more better things to do that can be productive and at the same time serve as therapy for me...   so there you go... this is my humble explanation for the unfulfilled promises that i had made to some of you.  hehehe...

      Guys, do you remember that unforgettable night last Chinese New Year (aka Charles' boitday party)? Ha ha. Who could ever forget the Spin the Bottle/Dare or Dare game? What was that line that I wrote in one of my entries before?   " Since that night, we never looked at each other the same way again. .."       Firewerks        Drunk Indiekids        Ayn and JP        Ayn and Charles    (All photos courtesy of JP's phone)  I wasn't able to save all our pictures. The ones that I have here are the pics where I'm in. Hehe. Will try to find more pics where we're all present.  Anyway, I hope this is close enough to make you remember how unforgettable that night was :)  Selena's right when she said,  " This was the height of our closeness as a band, I think ." We all think that.

       Having to accompany some Backbeat bands to Lucena last Saturday, Allan gave the reins for Buzz Night to me and Charles. I told Charles that I might be late because I had made plans to visit Ayn right before Buzz Night.  He said he'd take care of it until I got there.  I took Edwina with me to Ayn's.  She and her law school friend Trina were just getting ready.  They had their matching iBooks open on picnic tables in Ayn's room.  They seemed to have been constantly working right up until they started dressing.  It was great to see Ayn again and meet Trina.  We were all excited about Buzz Night.  Ayn brought Tristania into the room and I was surprised at how much she's grown in the past few months.  She's so round and pink and healthy, like a pretty little ball, and I teased her that she was getting to be like her Ninong Allan.  At first, she was a little reserved, but with the help of some jumping on Ayn's black satin sheets, she became playful and hyperactive.  Then she would kiss each of us in turn and hug us tightly; she did that over and over again, much to our delight.  She wailed when it was time for us to go, so her lolo and lola decided to take her with them as they drove us to Mayric's.  I think Charles was ready to panic by the time we got there, though it was only 10 pm.  I guess he was nervous being alone and having to talk to all the bands, which I wasn't so keen to do, either.  Thankfully, most of them were there already and Charles had them settled into a good sequence that everyone agreed upon.  I was impressed that he had handled all of it without my help, and it seemed that there were a number of walk-ins, too.  Ralph was there and it was great to see him.  His hair was longer and he was wearing his red sweatshirt.  He said he was sorry but he had run out of invitations to Charmaine's baby shower.  He told us that this was one of the few times he was out of the house as he's been swamped with work-- he has at least four major projects he needs to work on simultaneously.  All he does to battle insanity is download stuff from Soulseek (he also told us a pretty funny story about someone's opinion on who to ask about indie if you're from the Philippines).  Suddenly, Charles said that someone wanted to talk to me.  It turned out to be one of the new bands, Switch.  They had called Allan the night before and he told them to talk to me or Charles when they arrived at Buzz Night.  But everything had been settled, so what did they want with me?  Anyway, I faced the two guys and they actually just wanted to know about Buzz Night… was it a regular event? Was it a club? Haha… I was really nervous because I didn't feel like I was the person to ask but I told them some basic stuff they needed to know and said they should ask Allan himself when they meet him.  I asked them what they played and they said, "Industrial," and I said, "Great."  They seemed intrigued by the whole thing.  Ok, no critiques here, just observations.  So Five Leaves Left started the night early minus their curly-haired bassist, plus their pretty boy floppy-haired bassist.  Now Allan can't form a band with them and call themselves The Don't-Mess-With-Us band.  They seem to be getting better and better and I noticed a lot of heads moving to their music.  Next followed the industrial pair Switch.  The more aggressive audience members liked them and they gave a heavy touch to the night.  It was then that my friends Dottie and JV arrived (they actually paid entrance!)… they wanted to see Charles perform, having met him during several nights out before, and they also wanted to catch a certain band (secret, hehe).  Edwina was sleepy, but Trina graciously entertained her with some parlor tricks so she could stay awake.  I suddenly had a bad asthma attack, having left my inhaler in Ayn's van, and so I had to step out with my friends and buy an emergency Ventolin at Mercury Drug ("damn, there goes my chicharon bulaklak money!").  When we returned to Mayric's, it was already Blue Stellar's last song, so I wasn't able to catch much of their performance.  Ralph disappeared around that time, but I hadn't noticed when exactly.  He might have still caught some of Sunset Drive, but I'm not sure.  Anyway, before he left, he told me that he had an interesting experience while waiting outside Mayric's at 8:30 pm (I don't know why, but he decided to go there really early--- probably to soak up enough Mayric's tugtugan vibes to last him a month of seclusion, hehe!).  He said that some people passed by and read the line-up for Buzz Night and one of them commented, "Ay sayang, hindi tutugtog yung Candyaudioline." Ralph just sat there chuckling to himself.  Next came Sunset Drive's strong performance, and then Children of Eden.  I remember watching the latter before on the night of my first Mayric's gig… Ayn had brought me with her to Klub Fluid to help her friend's band and they played that night. I was surprised that they were lined up for Buzz Night; I think someone recommended them.  Their music did sound right, but I wasn't sure about the vocals as it seemed a bit mainstream.  Still, they went with the flow, and people liked them.  By this time, since it was early, Charles had already asked them and the remaining bands to play 5 songs each.  Tether took the stage, minus one of their guitarists (the one with glasses).  Joel, their bassist, was forced to sub for him and they got someone else to do the bass; these would probably account for the guitars' super loudness later on.  I approached them, remembering they only used to have four songs before, so I could request them to play their Heavenly cover for the fifth, but they assured me they could play 5 songs.  Their guitars were really loud and there was no one to manipulate the sound system that night, which made it very, very difficult for their diminutive vocalist to keep up, but this did not mask the coolness of their 2 new originals.  I was impressed at how much they've grown since they first played Buzz Night.  My friend JV, who doesn't really listen to much music, later on commented that the bands he liked best that night were Tether and Popular Days, and that says a lot about those bands.  JV generally doesn't like anything that assails the ear, but in spite of Tether's absolute love for volume, he appreciated them.  That says a lot, believe me.  Next, Popular Days performed.  Once again, they proved to be the darlings of the night.  The crowd was charmed by them and I couldn't resist calling out a fond shout of "Manyak!!!" or two.  One funny thing happened, though.  Charles was nervous in between songs and so he suddenly said, "Pasensya na, wala si Allan ngayon.  Meron siyang… proyekto."  I was coming from the bathroom and heard one of the walk-in patrons say, "Anong sabi niya?"  The girlfriend said, "Si Allan daw…" to which he replied, "Si Allan? Sinong Allan? Maraming Allan eh!" Haha! I remembered that question by one of the Switch guys on whether Buzz Night was a club.  Bagetsafonik sealed the night with pleasing melodies interspersed with electronic beeping.  I think it was a fitting end to July's Buzz Night.  After the gig, we were sitting around waiting for people to leave when this old guy went up to Charles and said, "Galing!  Sa Tuesday ha!"  Charles said, "Salamat, sige."  When the man left, I asked Charles what he had meant by that and he said, "Hindi ko nga alam eh!"  Haha!  Whatever the case, I think the man had been impressed by Popular Days and probably had assumed that they would be playing at Back to The Edge, a New Wave production coming up at Mayric's.  I told Charles how much I appreciated him single-handedly manning Buzz Night. It was a pity Allan wasn't there, but I'm glad it was successful anyhow.
