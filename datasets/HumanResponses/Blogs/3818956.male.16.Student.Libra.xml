      ...pick it up, call me It's been a stressful weekend. So much has happened, and so much that I wanted to happen hasn't.&nbsp; "the best laid plans of mice and men." How exactly do mice make plans anyways? Probably not very easily. But yeah, there's a lot of people to pray for this weekend. Just pray for..people in general I guess, a lot of us could use it.  Well, I'm off to bed, it's time for another full week of work, wish me luck.

      I was thinking about the lyric in my title, and I'm curious as to what Brand New meant when they said that (Play Crack the Sky, off the album Deja Entendu). The thing I was wondering was, do they mean it in a good way or a bad way? Because the lungs are made up of partly water, but also water in your lungs can be really bad. Any ideas?   Well, at work today, I...worked? I don't know. I'm getting tired of telling you people (the whole 1 or 2 people who read this) that I got cut and bled and just listened to music all day. That's basically what's happened again. It was boring. But when I got home, I had this brilliant idea - Hang out with Aaron! So he came over for a while and we had a great time, but when he left for a bit of work at school, I fell asleep and nobody answered his calls, thus ruining my fun evening. Well, that's all I got. Peace Easy.

      I decided for the title of my blogs, I'd fill in random song quotes about how I feel or maybe just quotes from songs I like. This one's from Memory by Sugarcult. It's basically my way of saying "remember me" to all those people I don't see anymore or won't be seeing cause of things like college or work or something.  Okay so, today, although just as long as every other work day, seemed to go pretty quickly. The sunburn did put a small damper on my chipper mood (you know, from waking up at 5:40), but I got over that, because I had no choice.   (Holy Random Part Batman! I just turned on TV Land and guess what show is on? ALF! Yes, Gordon Schemway himself is on TV. Great stuff.)  Ok, back to my day. Basically all of it was work, work, work. However, I did go to Burger King and used my Spidey Sense to win me a free small hash browns. Whoopie.

      Very quickly I'm seeing why I don't do anything on the internet. Nobody looks at it, or if they do, they don't comment (other than Josh, good job). Well, over the weekend I successfully managed to gain a bad sunburn along with a touch of sun poisoning. All in all though, it went pretty well. Shot off a few (hundred) fireworks and had a great ole' time. I'm still waiting for a few people to actually call, I'll let you know if that happens. (If - key word)  Not much else to say. The new Taking Back Sunday CD comes out in about 22 days. Go rush out and get it when it does.

      I'd be pissed.   -The funniest thing I heard all day at work. It was in a conversation between two supervisors and just made me laugh. And at work, laughing is a necessity. Along with music. And it seems like blood. I got cut once again, and this one hurt and bled like crazy.  Lets see, my day. Well, 6:00 A.M. unfortunately came once again, and I do believe I despise it more every day. I woke up and checked to see how charged my iPod was - not very. That made me unhappy, but I finally came to the conclusion that the charge doesn't register on the screen for a little while (and I have no idea why). So I listened to music all day while I built that little art desks that would supposedly piss off little kindergarten students. After I came home, I left again to have my hair cut and I must say I like it a lot better. Then came the "fun part" of the day. The Whitecaps game for my dad's company. Whoo, whatta doozie. The game was pretty boring, so once again, I listened to my music. You'd think I love music or something, wouldn't you? Oh yeah, I drank a lot of free pop and ate a lot of free food too.   Sorry my life's so boring. Maybe something exciting will happen tomorrow...

      Can you believe it? I'm actually taking the time to fill all of you in on my life! As interesting as it may be talking about going to and from work, I'll try to include more than just what cuts appeared on my hands at work or how sick I'm getting of packed lunches. I'll let you into the real me. You know, the part you knew was there, but always was afraid to ask.  Well, why don't I tell you about my day? Starting things off at 6:00 A.M. always leaves me bright and chipper, and this morning especially, my alarm scared the life out of me. I guess I must've turned it up accidentally. Next came the tough part of the day, 9.5 hours of work. The music really helps pass the day, without it, I believe I'd be going crazy. After work, I came home and showered and got myself all pretty and went and hung out with Jaclyn. We ate at Applebees and good times ensued. Preceding, I was planning to come home and play my guitar, but my tiredness gained control of me and I took a two hour nap (Which was interrupted by Sarah calling. Oh well, I'm not really a nap person anyways). Finally I decided to start this blog, which brings you up to the present.  Michael
