      Just got the Blogger email & signed up. My "name" is arizonacolbys - in case you had any doubts. :)  I just tried to send you out a pic of the Piggy cake I made for Kara tonight. I think it came out pretty cute & Colby & Arizona seem to like it. Hopefully everyone enjoys it tomorrow, I know I will. Still not sure what we're doing tomorrow evening - we've got Kara's birthday to celebrate before she disappears for the evening, the Strawberry Festival is this weekend & Craig wanted to see the Reds vs the Indians tomorrow night at 7. Not sure we can get it all done & I'm sure the weather will play a role in our final decision. Well, I better go - some cupcakes are calling my name - have fun on the road again tomorrow - I'll talk to you soon!  Love, Em :)

      Arrived back in Willoughby to the new apartment late Saturday after a two day drive from Hutchinson. Since we only moved into the apartment 4 days before we headed out of town, it doesn't feel quite like home. But all our stuff is here, so it's at least familiar.  After unloading and cleaning up the mess, we gave the little dog, Dink, a bath. Had to get some of the road dirt off of him. Both the kids met us for a burger and a nice visit before going their separate ways.   Will be back at work on Monday, only 6 months now to finish out the year here. We plan a 3 week trip to Oregon in August, so there will be more adventures to post then. In the mean time, I'll try to post occasionally as we progress toward our goal.   What's the goal? Heading out on a permanent road trip in January 2005. Counting down will go fast from here on out.

      Feels like Friday here, which is nice. Supposed to be 80 degrees & stormy this afternoon. Not showing such great weather for tomorrow, now. High of 68 & chance of rain. Planning on going to the zoo to visit some furry creatures, we'll have to see if the weather holds up. Maybe we'll see a movie instead. Going to the Captains game tomorrow night with some friends - it's a fireworks night, so we can stick around & watch some great fireworks from our seats after the game. It should be fun. Looking forward to seeing everyone on Saturday (or whenever you all return.)Have a great day in Kansas!

      Hello- thanks for stopping by our Blog!  We arrived here in Hutchinson, Kansas on Monday morning. We had reserved space at the Great North American RV Rally, along with about 5,000 other RVers. Turns out almost 7 inches of rain in the last two weeks had eliminated a lot of planning parking areas in the fields surrounding the local airport. So after sitting in line on a two lane road for an hour, thinking we were about to be parked, we were informed it was time to turn around and go back home. The local sheriff came around telling everyone there were no more available parking spaces. A background note - this same rally was held here two years ago, and after parking everyone there was a deluge of rain. There were so many motorhomes stuck in mud up to the axle it took almost one month to get them all towed out of the fields. You can see why they reluctant to repeat this adventure.  We were about to turn around and head home, when our friends here found us a wonderful parking spot behind the local Microtel. So here we are, spending the week in Hutchinson, Kansas. Seems few people actually left, there are RVers stuck in every little nook of a parking space around town. The local mall looks like an RV convention of its own.  The weather has been great, the people are friendly, and the adventure continues.....  Thanks again for stopping by on our road trip.

      It's a little on the cool side this morning, but the sun is shining brightly. It's quiet so far this morning - had to drop my Jeepster off at the tire store - discovered last night that I had a nail in my back tire. It should be ready to pick up sometime this morning. Our neighbors put up a shed in the backyard the day before yesterday. The dogs really weren't too sure about that, and they were sure to let everyone know how they felt about it. It's been too chilly to swim here most days - it's probably been a week since we've been in the pool. It doesn't stop Arizona though, she goes for a dip almost daily, sometimes many times daily. We went for Mexican food last night & it was yummy. Well, better get back to work - hope you're enjoying your time in the wheat fields! :)

      Arrived in Breckenridge this afternoon. Breck is such a charming town surrounded by spectacular mountain ranges. Here it is the end of June and there is still snow on all the mountains. It was only 65 for a high today. Sure felt cooler after the heat of New Mexico. We're just enjoying the clear crisp mountain air. Tomorrow we plan to get out the bikes and see how far we can go!

      Back to the RV for the night. Spent the day walking the streets of Sante Fe and just soaking in the sunshine and culture. I browsed the shops for a few hours and managed to refrain from buying anything big (since I don't have any place to put anything big anyway, this was wise.) We had an early dinner at the Blue Corn Cafe. Wonderful choice, food was great and we had a little table at an open window looking over the street below. After dinner we took a short walk and watched the sunset over the far mountain range. The views here at the park are truly beautiful.  Tomorrow morning we head for Breckenridge. Will be an interesting contrast to be in the high mountains after being here in the dessert sun.

      The doggies had an exciting evening last night. They were both sound asleep with their feet in the air, around 10 pm, when I asked them if they'd like to go for a ride. They were rather confused, but of course excited to go for a road trip in the Jeepster. We had to drive out to Madison to drop Craig's Jeep off again for service (they didn't finish the job last time.) It gets pretty dark out there late at night. Colby was in the back of the Jeep, standing with his head between the front seats just staring out at the open road, waiting to see what would happen next. They went nuts when we drove all that way & picked up their buddy, Craig at the Jeep dealer in Madison. It's supposed to rain again today - never rained much yesterday - just real cloudy & gray. I'm hoping for some nice swimming weather this weekend.

      Drove up from Las Cruces today to Sante Fe. Beautiful drive. Stopped in Albuquerque for dinner at the Texas Land & Cattle Co. Dink was out of steak you know! We arrived in Sante Fe late in the evening. It's about 20 degrees cooler here than Las Cruces. Watched the sun set over the mountain range and the lights come on in the valley.

      Well, it's Wednesday. Not much is new here. It's looking like it might rain here today - it's a bit dreary out. Craig, Colby, Arizona & myself all went swimming together last night. It was quite an event as usual. It's supposed to cool down for the next couple of days - so it may not be swimming weather for a while - the water is still pretty chilly. We are going to try & go to the Captains game on Saturday night. It's going to be a double-header starting at 6 & both games will only be 7 innings. We invited Craig's parents to go with us for Father's Day since Craig will be closing on Sunday. They are giving away Captains scrubs pants to the first 2,000 people, so we want to get there early. We can't wait to get some tasty pizza at the game, too. Well, I better get back to work - talk to you later!

      DIESEL DOG here - reporting in from the road trip. It's been a little rough here and there, but overall, the old folks have been okay. They keep the food coming and the water bowl full. Can't complain too awful much. Life's pretty good here for a dog I suppose. &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      Well we weren't in Albuqerque even 24 hours aftr all. We headed south for Las Cruces. Seems we were still in the mode to travel. So here we are at the Hacienda RV Resort. It's very nice here, a little warmer than Albuquerque. It was 103 today, but you know - it's a dry heat. I compare it to a convection oven.   We ate at Si Senor - great little mexican place downtown and just drove around to see the sites. Lots of new construction here, beautiful homes everywhere you look.   Spunky little road runner crossed our path today, and the hills are covered with yucca plants and cactii. The organ mountains make a beautiful backdrop to the city.   We will take a couple days off here and then head back toward Sante Fe before the end of the week.

      We finally made it to Albuquerque about 6:30 last night. It's wonderful as always, clear blue skies and 97 degrees.  First stop had to be our favorite mexican meal at Garduno's. Then during a quick stop at Borders for newspapers, Jon talked to a security guard who used to live in Ashtabula. It always amazes me what a small world it is. He told us if we moved to Las Cruces, half the people there are from Cleveland.  We spent the night at the local Walmart Supercenter - another amazing tidbit: the inside of the Walmart in Elkhartm Indiana, is exactly the same as the Walmart in Albuquerque, New Mexico.   We will get settled in a local campground today and take a couple days off. We've been so busy and so stressed the last few weeks selling the house, we are looking forward to just doing nothing. And this is a great place to do that.  We plan to head down to Las Cruces on Wednesday. Wishing you all had sunny skies like we do.

      Well, we had a busy day today. After about 1 o'clock the sun finally poked thru the clouds & it really started to warm up. After trying to clean some of the leaves & cottony stuff out of the pool, I decided it was a good day for a swim. The dogs got buckled into their lifejackets and dove into the pool. The water was still a bit chilly, but it was really nice to finally enjoy the pool this year. The dogs & I swam for a couple of hours before everyone became exhausted. After our afternoon swim, it was a good time for everyone to get a bath. Colby & Arizona probably thought the pool cleaned them off enough & that I was crazy for getting them into the bathtub. They're both conked out now with their feet in the air. I may have to turn the air back on this evening - I think it's 81 in the house now & it's supposed to be in the 80's the next few days. I also got 2 scrapbook pages done today, did some cleaning & am working on my laundry. Craig will be late getting home tonight since they're preparing for a district visit on Tues. Well, time to go veg out some on the couch with some furry goofs - hope it's not too late when you make it into Albuquerque.   Em :)

      Left Elkhart this morning and made it to Joplin Missouri before we called it a day. Parked here in the scenic Walmart parking lot overlooking the Missouri hills. Took an hour to get our new Direcway dish to find the satellite. I sure hope it's not this painful everytime. We should be in Alburquerque tomorrow night. Looking forward to that! Gotta get me some Garduno's!  Cool dog pics - Jon says they look like dachsunds with their legs cut off in the pic! Hope everyone enjoyed the pig cake. Wish I was there for a bite!

      Here it is - our very own Blog! Please come here often to share your news and check up on ours. We are starting a new venture in our life at the end of this year, and thought a Blog might be a good place to track our journey, sometimes look back at the past, and occasionally ponder our future.

      Doggie Day at the Ballpark in Eastlake turned out quite a few doggies and their humans today. It was quite a site to see so many dogs in a place where dogs aren't usually allowed. Craig, Colby, Arizona & I even made the jumbo tron in between innings. They're such good looking dogs, the camera couldn't help but zoom in on their furry mugs. The 1st 500 dogs received a great doggie gift bag complete with: a collar, leash, Frisbee, Beggin' Strips, Canine Carry Outs, Milkbones, and various other assorted treats. As you can see - we got the family photo done pre-game with our favorite mascot, Skipper. Craig &amp; I had a slice of pizza in the picnic pavilion before the game (Colby & Arizona were happy to finish off my crust.) All in all - it was one great day at the Ballpark. Colby &amp; Arizona were very well-behaved & can't wait to go back next summer!
