       I'm a post-grad, middle aged professional, working and living in Washington, D.C.  ... and I love cars.    I change my own oil and rotate my tires.  I have upgraded my car's suspension, and I enjoy washing and waxing my car.  I take my car to track events and I read car magazines.  I think about cars a lot.  This makes me a bit of a freak.  As a professional in D.C., I'm supposed to view my car with great indifference, much like I view my dishwasher, or the roofing on my home.  I'm supposed to buy my car from a dealer, drive it 3 or 4 years, bring it to the dealer for scheduled maintenance, and trade it in on the next new model.    It is an unwritten code that professionals are not supposed to get passionate about their cars -- in fact they are supposed to know nothing more than make and model.  Being a car nut is for rednecks, grease monkeys and high school punks!  I do not need to explain my passion -- because as with any passion, it is not acquired with logical forethought, it just happens.  So, in truth, I do not know why I am passionate about cars.  I just am.  Cars are amazing technology, they are artwork, they are expensive, they are important, they are fast, fun and macho.    As I get older and less concerned with outward impressions, I have become more likely to confess my passion for cars. Sometimes I get a positive reaction (from another closet car nut), sometimes it's bewilderment.  But I still do all my car work with my garage door closed, and I feel a twinge of embarrassment while washing my car (which was cleaner than all of my neighbors' cars before I started to wash it).

       With any luck, this will be the last presidential battle where the candidate's service in Vietnam has any relevance.  Vietnam vets are getting older, and that means that the next generation (a vast majority of which were able to avoid military service quite legally) soon will be our candidates.  Finally, Vietnam will be behind us (at least as a campaign volleyball).  This Sunday the Washington Post ran an extraordinarily detailed chronology of the "incident" in Vietnam that has been the focal point of the Bush/Kerry campaign dispute.  It showed Kerry's swift boat graphically represented throughout it's mission up a river, up a canal, and back; including places where they came under fire and attack by mines.  It shows Kerry's positioning to the minute!  The crux of the debate is whether Kerry acted heroically (deserving of a medal) or not.  There is no doubt, however, that Kerry was on that boat, in Vietnam, taking enemy fire.  To me, an undecided voter, this is bizarre.  The guy who went to Vietnam is actually on his heels defending himself against the guy who got into the Texas National Guard!.  As a voter, what matters most to me in that timeline, is not whether the candidate's actions were heroic and medal-deserving, but what the  other  candidate was doing over that timeframe.  8:05AM:   Kerry advances up river.  .........  Bush having lunch in Texas. 8:15AM:    Kerry unit involved in ambush.    ....... Bush napping in Texas. 8:45AM:    Kerry boat hit by live fire.   .............   Bush watching TV.  I'm making up the Bush activities, but there is NOTHING he could have been doing that would be more hazardous than Kerry's actions during that time.  The bottom line is, regardless of his behavior after the war, during the Vietnam War, Kerry put himself in harm's way, voluntarily, and performed admirably.  It seems to me that the issue of his service is a nonissue, and that the focus should be on the war protest issues where Kerry acted, perhaps, less honorably.

       There are no facts, there are only statements.  There is no truth there are only positions.  With that background, let's cut through the nonsense and realize that there are nine political parties representing 99.9% of the population.  It starts with three groups (Republican, Democrat and Independents), and each of them has a definition of the other, totaling nine.  Here they are.  Republicans as seen by Republicans: >  True patriots. >  Believers in capitalism and free markets. >  The backbone of our economy and society.  Democrats as seen by Democrats: >  True patriots. >  Righting the wrongs wrought by human weakness. >  Open minded.  Independents as seen by Independents: >  True patriots. >  Open minded. >  Hesistant to become associated with Republicans or Democrats.  Republicans as seen by Democrats: >  Elitist (aka selfish since the party base is among the elite). >  Offering safe harbor to racism, sexism, nepotism and corporate interests.  Republicans as seen by Independents: >  Well intentioned at the core. >  Loopy and scary at the fringes.  Democrats as seen by Republicans: >  Socialists (robbing the successful to benefit the unsuccessful). >  Pie-in-the-sky dreamers. >  Jealous of true achievers.  Democrats as seen by Independents: >  Well intentioned at the core. >  Loopy and scary at the fringes.  Independents as seen by Republicans >  Lazy, uncommitted and/or apathetic.  Independents as seen by Democrats >  Lazy, uncommitted and/or apathetic.

       We used to dream of building mountains, and now we build chasms, and we're damn proud of it.  I've lived in and around Washington DC since 1979.  Despite this, I have remained very a-political.  I have never worked in any branch of any government, and other than voting, I have not participated in any political process.  I'm registered independent.  The upcoming (2004) election has been an awakening.  For the first time, I care deeply about the outcome.  So much is at stake -- the status of our nation in the world, our safety, the financial well being of Americans, including myself and my family.    As someone with no investment in either political party, I am shocked at how the current political structure has co-opted 90% of independent thought.  I guess it's like religion -- you can vastly simplify your life by "checking the box" and adopting a full life-coda as offered by your local franchise of a multinational religious organization.   We actually have people who are proud to proclaim themselves as "dittoheads."  Why force yourself to think, and measure and decide on difficult issues?  Just pick your preacher and proclaim, "Whatever he says, I'm with him!"  Pitiful.  It's like your personal view of the whole world has been categorized as peanut butter -- chunky  or smooth.  Nothing else.  It is much more complicated than that, and I intend to face that complexity and arrive at my own conclusions.  I wish more people would do so.  I work with some of the brightest people in the world, and to see them locked into the "chunky/smooth" dichotomy is depressing and disappointing.  The chunky camp will always be chunky because they don't entertain any other possibililities -- the same for the smooth camp.  Case in point.  I support our troops, and I wish them success in their efforts to turn Iraq into a viable democracy.  I think it's possible, and news of today suggests a ray of light in dealing with radical Muslim leaders.  I also think it was wrong to have entered Iraq when we did,  and how we did it.    WHAT?   That kind of thinking is not permitted in the chunky/smooth world!  You're a true believer, or a traitor!  You cannot disect issues and take reasoned positions!   NO.   What is most disturbing about this is that a moderated, complex view is dismissed and discredited by the chunkies and the smoothies.  It's too distracting, it's not simple enough.  It creates the possibility of common ground!  In requires someone to admit that they may have been wrong!!   And there's the nub of it.

       I'm about 115 pages into this massive book.  That 250 pages if it was in "normal" font with "normal" margins.  So far, the themes are speaking to me loud and clear.  It has tremendous relevance to me right now, and to the microcosm that I occupy.  The questions is whether I will be able to make it through the book.  Character A walks into a room and sizes up Character B,  15,000 words later (after an in-depth analysis of each character's appearance and mental processes), they say "Hi" to each other.    We'll see.
