       Once I gave a look to you but you never gave it back. So here I stand expressionless, but my memory's intact. I guess the past is good for a laugh, a comedy so dry and black. It makes my stomach hurt so bad that I cried. Two thumbs up we give this one, despite its predictable ending. The dialogue seemed rushed and wrong, but the actors did their best to place some worth on every word, like coffins dropped into the earth. The saddest sound we ever heard...we sang along... We sang it...take this weight away, take this weight away...    I'LL BE YOUR FRIEND    You said they laid out lots of coke, but you don't know how much you did. Now you don't want me to go home 'cause you're afraid you might get sick. Just like the bad news you accept, just like that boy you're gonna get. It's all those drunken promises. I'll be your friend but you just haven't made me yet. So you come chasing after me, but I'm just barely out the door. Down in the belly of the beast, we waited with the passengers. Just like that train I gotta catch, just like that song I can't finish. It's the mistake I won't regret. You'll be my friend but I just haven't made you yet. You talk when you're drunk like you're standing in front of a microphone. And each night it repeats and you fall into me like a domino. And you talk when you're drunk like you're writing it up for an article. And you think that I lie when I tell you goodbye and then I've got to go, 'cause I've got to go. But I guess it's a success, we're at our best when you're all upset. I'll be your friend but you just haven't made me yet.  Music:Bright Eyes-Black Comedy
