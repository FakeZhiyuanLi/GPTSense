      So these last 2 days have been like a huge depressing fest. Bens car that he has been working soo hard on for the past few months got a little boo boo. He was driving in the rain and it took in some water and so now he needs a whole new engine. I just feel so bad because that car is like his love (well one of them at least) He works soo hard on it and to see it all the sudden get damaged this way makes me feel soo bad and sad. I am having some of the worst simpathy pains!  Also he has been getting sicker and sicker by the day. His eyes are becoming all poofy and he is all itchy in select spots. (YOU DONT LOOK LIKE AN OLD MAN THOUGH BEN!!) I have been trying to go and visit him the most that I can because he means so much to me and I care so much for him. Ben is like one of the greatest friends a person could possibly ask for! He is there for you when you need him even if he is really busy he will make time for you. I dont think I could ever thank him enough for being such a great friend. I hate seeing him soo down and depressed and I cant wait to see him smile again! I really wish that I could do more than just sit at his bedside or write him a get well card. I really wish I could work miracles and make this bad dream go away or get him the money to get his new engine. (I AM giving him $500 though whether he likes it or not). But right now I guess all I can do is pray for the best for him and comfort him. I just wish I could do more!! :/ Ben- I love you and you mean soo much to me. I would hate to ever loose you and I just hope you feel better soon. I cant wait to see your smile again and to see you happy. I think that would be one of the most rewarding days of my life! I love you!! -heather

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday was cRaZy!! I had dance from 5-6 and the 7-8. Well I have hip hop from 5-6 and that class is a lot of fun!! We worked on our combo to Tipsy again and it is soo cute. I just need to work on it a lot so I might acctually look descent when I do it. Then from 6-7 we have like a break and we always just run over to Target and get a bite to eat and then head back for jazz class. Well me and Mariah really dont like jazz and it was also raining like cRaZy!! By the time we all got into Target (Kelly, Mariah and I) we were all drenched so we sat and ate and talked and kelly then called her mom to come and get her to take her to the dance place&nbsp;because she didnt feel like running in the rain again. So then&nbsp;Mariah and I&nbsp;made the decision to SKIP BABY!!&nbsp; We are such rebels! We had it all planned out even though it didnt work that good. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See the Lord does cruel things sometimes. Hes a great guy but sometimes I get the idea that he doesnt feel the same about me. Well it got time to run back to the dance place so we didnt get caught and of course it was raining the hardest it had the whole night. Like you couldnt even see the whole parking lot. It was terrible!!! So&nbsp;Mariah and I&nbsp;were like we are runny like heck to the closest cover and then we will take a break and do it again!! Well see when rain is coming at you its really hard to run. So yea we thought we were going all fast when we were like crawling. It was pathetic! We just decided it would probably just be easier to walk. So we walked over to the verizon store and stood under the little cover for like a second and then we started again and we hid over by where half price books is so our teacher wouldnt see us. lol Then&nbsp;THANK GOD&nbsp;Mariahs brother got there and we sat in the car until my mom got there and I guess she couldnt see me because it was so dark because she didnt ask me one question of why I was dripping wet. My feet were litterally swimming in my shoes because since I have clima cools and since they arent supposed to be taken in water because they have vents&nbsp;that will let water in like -that i was swimming. It was terrible. My pants were stuck to me my shirt was like soo wet it was stretching and I could just feel the cold water dripping down my back from my hair. You know how everyone says no good deed goes unpunnished well that should be changed to no good&nbsp;lie goes unpunnished. But despite all that and all the rain I am still sooooooo glad I skipped jazz!! NO ORBITZ OR DOUBLES FOR ME!!!! YAYA! Mariah and Me have successfully skipped twice now!! Once for Teams and now once for Jazz!!  Well I am going to go because me and my brother are jammin out to Awesome God....lol dont ask please! i love you miss rebel heather!!! jk

      Today was dedicated to the BFFL'S man!! First Ben picked me up and we went to Maegans to visit&nbsp;Mea Mea&nbsp;and Chelsme because Chelsme felt her worst...poor girl! So we went to Maegans for a while and just like hung out in her room and did a little "cleaning up" haha ::snip snip:: and then the shutter guy came in to hang her shutters so we left and went to Benjis so he could change into his basketball clothes...he was pimpin!! We picked out his clothes and everything and it all matched down to the shoes and socks and everything. Then afterards we headed to Chelsmes and hung out there and finished "cleaning up" there. So now if you are wondering everything is nice and clean. after that we went to bens basketball games which were just at the church and when he was done playing we all took one of his jerseys and since i had the like undershirt one we had to change shirts and man it looked hot on him.lol so then we headed to maegans and we all just layed in her bed until like 11:30 and thats when we all cleared out so he would meet curfew.  i am telling you this had to be the MOST&nbsp;FUN day ever!! I was soo sad when it ended. :'(  i love you guys!! heather

      Okay so today was kinda interesting, funny, and scary all in one. So I woke up around like 11 and right away just went outside and took a walk because it felt soo good outside!!! I did like my usual walk around my neighborhood where like I go behind it and then all the way to the front but some of the like scariest but funniest things happened. First I start walking in the back&nbsp; like bike trail or whatever they call it and back there everyone has to have those roughtiron fences so you can see through them and i guess it was potty time for all the dogs because EVERY house I walked by back there I heard like clinking of the chains and then like the dogs would bark like cRaZy!! Now im used to being barked at by the "construction workers" but by the dogs?!? jkjk it was pretty scary.  And then I walked a little bit farther like close to the railroad tracks and there are bigger trees back there and all the sudden this swarm of birds come swopping down and like look like they are about to bonbard me! It was like this is like the movie!! But it turns out they only wanted whatever was in that tree.....THANK GOD!  So i continued to walk the neighborhood and I finally got out of the back part so i didnt have to deal with anymore nonsense...at least i thought! So i walk to the very fornt neighborhood thingy thats like seperated from my neighborhood but connected? its weird but yea its like in this circle thingy so i walked around there and i thought it was just me and all the sudden i look up and there is this old lady knitting on a rocking chair and i jumped like 5 feet! i was TERRIFIED!! Then she was like "How are you doing today sweetie pie" and i wanted to say something like "just dandy you old scary scary women!" but instead i just said in my sweet voice (once i caught my breath of course) "really good thanks and yourself" but inside i was soo upset! man you think i am bad when you tickle me....no just try scarying me! aHhHhH! So yea then I figured it is definatly time to go back because this is getting out of control! So i start back tracking and head back the same way I came and the "barking construction workers" drove by in their truck and like waved and I was like "ok its not like this hasnt happened before im ok just keep walking, walking, walking" so i keep walking and then i hear  ::beep beep beep::  yes thats right THEY BACKED UP!!! i started picking it up a bit then. I dont mean like speed walking or walking a little faster I mean like in a jog! but then it turns out they were backing into a lot lol I felt kinda stupid but OMG!! it was soo scary.  So yea I HURRIED home!! I know I walk really fast sometimes but this topped all of those times by like 10! And when I got inside those doors I had NEVER been so happy to get home in my life!!

      Today I had the most boring day until like 4 or so! All day I just sat around on my butt and like didnt do anything but a few chores for my mom and mess around in my game room  trying  to improve my moves for jazz and stuff and it didnt really help any. I still suck!  Then&nbsp; later on I finally got into the shower and Ben picked me up and we went to Barnes and Nobles and got my summer reading books (like im going to read them anyways!) and then just went back to my casa and just talked in my media room. And we just found out some other freaky similarities and i mean freaky ones but yea thats another story! And then of course we had to ttalk to my mom because lord knows he cant come over without my mom talking to him for like 30 minutes about nothing at all! But she did promise that she would get us some aminal crackers for next time! YAY!! Moms do pay off sometimes!  Then around like 6:30 Debbie, the lady I babysit for came and so Ben had to go and I was off to watch the kiddos again. I hadnt seen these kids in like 1 1/2 months man so we had a fun time lemme tell you!! First I walked in the door and I was swarmed! I didnt think I made this much of an impact on these 3 little tots but i obviously did somehow.? We then watched Lion King 1 1/2 and danced to like every song and sang along and all that good stuff. We all had so much fun but then when it came to bed it got ugly!! Little 5 year old Carlton did not like calm down so I warned him I would tell his mom he was being a bad boy(even though i never evenn do) and then he calmed down....man i love those words..."ill tell mom!" And then the like 2 1/2 year old twins are now like big enough that they can get out of their cribs! So i had to watch them carefullly to make sure they didnt get out! It was crazy! But soo much fun. I missed babysitting so much so im happy to be back!!

      Friday was soo much fun!! I got up and showered and then headed over to Chelsmes and thats where Ben met us too and her mom took us and Ashley to Hawaiian Falls and it was only me and Bens first time there so it was so fun! We were there from like 12:30 to 4:30 or maybe later and then we had to go because Chelsy had to babysit. And on the way home Ben fell asleep...awwww we took a picture of it on his phone and it is soo cute but we know he will probably erase it. :'(  So when we got back to Chelsys we first did Bens hair which looked very interesting because we did like corn rows with butterfly clips lol he&nbsp;was pimpin! haha jk and then Chelsy and him played a little but of pool and then we had to leave so she could go and babysit.  Ben and me just went back to my house and sat around for like and hour or so because my mom decided to go to the gym and i couldnt like get a hold of her so we just like watched tv till she got home. Then when she finally did get home we had some dinner...PIZZA and brownies!! (and Ben i didnt burn it that bad ok!! I cant help that my oven is a little too hott!) and looked at my Hawaii pictures and stuff. And Mitchy my little bro bro wouldnt leave us alone. it was so funny because he was soo bored and had noting to do so my mom gave him chores haha.  Then we&nbsp;left and saw Harold and Kumar (Kum haha)&nbsp;go to Whitecastle with Bens friends Bryce and Anthony. (Maegan, me and Ben promise we will go with you again so you can use him to get into the movie lol) And it was a pretty good movie it had some really funny parts. We then left and Bryce wanted to race Ben and that was pretty funny lol Bens (racecar haha Chelsy) car against Bryces truck. and then he just took me home and it was another end of like a perfect night!  I now understand why I had to move to Texas!!   Ill talk to you guys later...   i love you  heather

      so yea on Wendsday I went to dance like usual until like 8 o'clock and it was fun I guess. We learned a dnace to Tipsy in hip hop and did the regular pransing around in jazz. Even though me and Mariah almost skipped but we didnt because Kelly kinda dragged us in there so we had to go. But then afterwards I pulled a big fib but let me tell you it was well worth it!! I dont know it i want to go into detail but Ill just say I had a great night and Im just going to leave it at that!! I love you guys!! heather

      These last two days have just been really awesome!! On monday i went in at 12 and took my driving test and my teacher said i did "awesome" but i still only got an 85%?? kinda confuses me there but whatever i passed!! but i was sure after i passed i pulled a few fast turns and man they felt sooo good!! lol Then after i finished my test i just hung out at the mall for a little while and checked out stores and cothes i want so i can drag my mom in there to buy them. hehe And OMG i saw the CUTEST shoes at finsih line (well acctually i saw like 3) and all 3 have pink in them and omg i want them soo bad!! Anywoo after i was there for a while Ben picked me up in his (awesome)&nbsp;car and we went to his house and looked at his baby pictures. lol they were all so adorable. Well then we left and went to his apartment thing and hung out there for a short while and then went to a car show where we spent most of our night (and ben i wasnt bored!!!!so you dont owe me anything) then right before he took me home we went for icecream to celebrate me passing my driving test! yay!! On Tuesday i went to driving lessons again and this one was my last!! all i had to do was parallel park and then i got to just drive around on the freeway and the country and just like everywhere. It was so much fun!! i then went home and was jamming out to tunes with Mitchy like all afternoon because we were both just like wired on nothing. it was strange but fun!! Then a little before 8 Ben came over! We looked at my baby pictures this time.lol i was not nearly as cute but what can i say. We then went swimming and played bball in the pool and he killed me at horse. Like the score was H-O-R-S-E to zero it was crazy but I knew he would beat me. After we got out of the pool it was FREEZING!! we like wore towels and then we turned off all the upstairs ac's to stop the cold air and everything. it was crazy cold!! Then Kyle and his gf Diana came over and we all watched euro-trip and Kyle brought him some clothes so he wasnt so cold and we both like wrapped up in blankets to keep in the heat. Around like 11:30 Kyle and his gf left and then like 30 min later Ben left. It was so much fun!

      Today was kinda boring... I woke up around 11:30 and then just laid around the house and did chores and then finally around 4:30 I went driving with my dad until about 5:15 or so because we had to get home for church....  but then when we were pulling out to go me and Mitchell noticed that one of the wheels was like almost totally flat so we had to stop at a gas station to like pump it up and check it and all that good stuff...Well just our luck...Someone was pumping up their tire too. By the time we FINALLY got our pumped and all even with all the other tires it was 6:10 and church starts at 6 and it takes about a good 10-15 minutes to get there. So my dad decided it was best to skip so we didn't like just come for communion like some people really do. So yea we didn't go to church and OMG!! That is like the first time we have EVER skipped. Besides like when we are on vacation and absolutely cant find a church. So yea Ill just say my mom was a little pissed at my dad but it wasn't like he had any control over it and we didn't want to have a blow out so I guess there is a good reason to skip but my mom told us to go and say our rosaries tonight. lol that's my mom for you..The married motherly nun!  Well I'm going to go because there is absolutely nothing exciting to tell you!  I love you  heather  &nbsp;  *mindy* hey my dearest llarrintt sister!! Good luck with moving today! I guarantee that KC wont be bad at all. You will make soo many more friends and stuff and I PROMISE I will fly up there and visit you, I don't care if its a longer flight I'm going to come no matter what because remember we WILL be friends until we are like 105!! Don't forget I'm always here for you if you need me. Good Luck and have fun!! I love you soo much!  **Your Llarrint sister

      This weekend I had soo much fun! It has to be one of my favorite summer times so far. On Friday night I went over to Maegans house around 4:30 and got completly lost lol it was great fun and finally got there around 5. After I got there we had Wendys and went and swang on the playground like little kids!! It was so much fun! Then like later that night..I guess around like 10 or so Ben came over and we talked for a while and just hung out in his car (he has the BEST car ever!!..im soo jealous). Then soon after Chelsy came over and hung out with us too and we just goofed around for a little while and then went to bed so we could wake up early the next morning for.... Well we woke up at 8 to get ready for Hurricane Harbor!! We all three got ready fast so we could be ready by the time the guys got to Maegans house....So yea&nbsp;Andy, Ben, Ryan, and Pham&nbsp;got there around 9:30 and we finally left around like 10:30 maybe?? i dont know and we just hung out at Hurricane Harbor.&nbsp; The first ride we did was like this straight down one and I was soo freaked out but it ended up being so much fun!!! And then we did a few other rides and like always hung out in the lazy river and the wave pool. And we also played volleyball a lot and we all fought over Bens "ball" It was&nbsp;soo much&nbsp;fun! We all like rolled in the sand and got covered since we were still wet&nbsp;and stuff and then Ben and Chelsy burried me in the sand. lol It took me forever to get the sand off me! And I still have a whole bunch of sand in my swimsuit..its cRaZy!&nbsp;But it was still so much fun.. Then later on during the day&nbsp;Chelsy, Ben, and me all lost the others in the lazy river so we just went on our own rides and stuff and it started to get really really cold because the sun was like going down so we went to my locker and got my towel which wasnt all that big and me and Ben like made it so we would both fit... it was pretty funny watching us try but whatever. After all that and finding everyone again we went to Wendys for some dinner and stuff and then we just went home and good thing because&nbsp; I was sooo tired and still am so i am going to go to bed! Good night, sleep tight! heather

      I am home and happy!! I had an awesome trip!! It was a total blast but there is nothing like being home!! I was bearly even gone but whatever! I was looking at the pictures on my dads digital and they look pretty good for the most part and Im going to get them on my computer asap!! Im kinda mad though because my dad took the best picture of me and Mitchell on the beach and we were both faking to be asleep because my mom was boring us like crazy to watch the sunset that was still and hour and a half away but she still wanted to just stand around and wait for it....it was CRAZY!!! But anyway someone ended up erasing it :'( Anyways now that I am home I get to drive again!!! My parents are thinking about making me now drive the concorde because Nick will be having our car a lot because of work and stuff so I have to drive the Concorde. I hate that car! Its like a boat its soo long. I am soo scared and on top of that I take my driving test on Monday! DUNDUNDUN! Im not sure I am going to pass. My dad told me though that tomorrow when Nick has to work that he will take him to work so I can practice drving in a smaller car since my test is in a civic which is like half the size of the Concorde. Im still trying to talk my dad into letting me drive the Saab but he keeps saying no. HUMF! Anyway on another note...today when we got back my dad went outside and checked the pool to make sure the craetaker did alright and when he was checking it he looked at the temp of the water and it was at 92!! PARTY! It is now at the temp that I will swim at (i am a total wimp!) I am just so happy to be home again (well my temp home again, we all know where my REAL home is&nbsp;with the red door&nbsp;hehe) if you wanna do anything then give me a buzz! Ill try to have some pictures next time!!

      ok this is really boring for you probably because its just everything i did on my vacation but whatever you can read it if you wanna.....   Thursday!  We all woke up around 7 to get ready and stuff and my daddy went and picked up my mommys car because the doors are all fixed from the accident and we loaded up the car and ended up being ready liuke an hour before we needed to be so we all went to subway and just took our precious time. NOthing much exciting really happened on this day at all. Like we got to our hotel at about 11 Hawaii time or 4 in the morning our time and considering none of us got any sleep on the plane we were sooo tired!   Friday!&nbsp; On Firday&nbsp;we all woke up at like 6am because we were all stuck on Texas time so it would be like 11 so none of us got like any sleep at all. But we went and had a light breakfast and then went out to the hotels pool to spend the day there. And let me tell you the hotel was amazing. There were like 4 seperate towers of hotels and in order to move around you rode either a boat thingy or a tram and it got you to were you wanted to be and also in this area since its a big resort there are all different types of shops and restaurants galour! Like anything you wanted they had. Then they had 4 acres worth of pools. There were some pools that were the regular water and cloreine and in those there were tons of water falls and slides and some slides that went through waterfalls. It was all so amazing. Like every corner you took was either like a slide or a waterfall or a groto or something really neat like that. Then there were also pools that had sand in them that they brought over from the beach and the water was also brought over from the ocean. Its kinda hard to explain what it was like but like you were swimming in the ocean but you werent. And in those areas you could swim with dolphins, go snorkling, paddle boating, kayaking, or just swim or lay on rafts. It was soo neat. I mostly just went down the slides with my brothers and we also went paddleboating and had competitions with my parents. And let me just say you dont put 3 soccer players in one boat and have them compete with the two parents because we kinda kicked there little tooshies! After we spent the whole day there we went back and just showered and went to go and eat dinner   Saturday!  This day was pretty boring for someone like me because I hate taking pictures. But anyway we drove around like all day and just went sight seeing kinda like off some really big mountains i guess and stuff and we saw the King Kamayamaya statue and stuff. And dont get me wrong it was all gorgeus but really kinda boring. One plus and fun part was that we went to this place that started with a P and had Ranch as the last word. i dont know the name (im so bad) Anyways we walked around there and did some shopping and goofed around a lot in the area.  Then later that night me and nick and mitchell all layed down in our hotel room (my parents had a seperate room) and mitchell fell asleep right away and nick was making fun of mitchells really really shaggy hair so he went and got his electric razor and ran his hands trough mitchells hair and turned the razor on and mitchell woke up soooo fast and jumped about 2 feet in the air (and i am NOT exaggerating at all) and like screamed NOOOOO!!!!! It was hilarious and then my parents called us and told us to shut up b/c we were being obnoxcious lol.   Sunday!!  Well early on sunday morning I woke up because Maegan called me phone at 6:30!!! and woke me up..haha jk maegan i was already awake I promise. And anyways we got up and went to breakfast just in the resort to make it fast and when we did we met this family who is also from Texas so we were talking and stuff and she asked my mom if she had lived in Texas all her life and she said no and that we were all pretty much born and raised in St.Louis and she told us that she could tell we were from somewhere else because of our accents. Excuse me...I am the BIGGEST midwest fan and stuff esspecially since my boys the cardinals are like kicking everyones butts right now and stuff but we do NOT have accents!! I say geaaagraphy normal! lol jk I seriously dont get it though! Will someone please explain it to me After breakfast we went straight to the beach and were there until like&nbsp;4or5 and i got the BEST IRISH TAN!! its nice and red and pink! Its soo attractive. My right forearm got it soo bad too where my cast was. Who would have guessed that 12 weeks in a cast would make your arm sensitive to the sun..hmmm. Well yea i got scorched! My forearm even stated blistering but then they all disappeared so its all good even though its kinda discusting looking still. But on the bright side of this day when we were walking back into the hotel there was this kid who looked around my age and he was soooo totally hott!!! i mean like gorgeus!! he and his family were just checking in and i felt like going up to him and saying no need i have my own bed andim very lonely!! but then the tram thingy came and my parents wanted to catch it so i had to go. :'(  Monday!!  This day was AMAZING!!! We woke up and got dressed and all got in the car right away and drove to the volcanoes and of course it was POURING DOWN RAIN! we got totally soaked but we still did some cool things. Like its about a 2 hour drive to the volcanoes and then we went through a lava tube and the devestation trail and all that neat stuff and then at night we went on this 3 mile trail to see the lava flow into the ocean and it is just amazing!! We have it on video now and if anyone wants to see it feel free to ask b/c it is a sight to see. I have never seen anything like it before. My shoes got kinda scuffed and are a little black in spots from all the lava rocks we had to climb on but it was well worth it. It was just exseptional!! You could see all the lava flowing down the volcano and then when it hit the water this big thing of steam would come up and you could see the glow of the red, yellow, and orange for miles! I though Pearl Harbor was really interesting when we saw that 4 years ago on Oahu but that has nothing on Mount Kilauea!  Tuesday!  We were completely dead and useless. Since the night before we had been on our feet all day and probably walked like 10 miles at the volcanoes our feet didnt want to move. We all slept in like a lot and had a really late lunch and just skipped breakfast and just hung out at the hotel and stuff. We like swam a little and kayaked at the hotel but other than that we just relaxed and man did that feel good!!  That night was a riot too. Me and my brothers all stayed up pretty late and my parents just crashed in their room. Mitchy kinda fell asleep a little early (of course) and me and Nick went channel surfing and found Bug Juice on the Disney Channel and we both just sat and laughed the WHOLE TIME!! And once Mitchy woke up from us laughing he joined in too. One of the girls said like the girls were "jumping out of their skin" and then they show the girls and they dont even look excited about it. And just the stupidest things set us off. It was one of the most&nbsp;fun and the&nbsp;most stupid&nbsp;nights!  Wendsday!  Our last day... We basically got up and packed up our stuff and the guys came and loaded our car and we had our whole day to shop because our plane wasnt until 10:30pm so we shopped ans shopped. Me and my mom had time to go into the Louis Vuiton Store and Coach and all those fun stores!! And my dad said I could get my coach purse that I want soo bad but they didnt have it there. i was soo pissed!!!! Then we went to dinner to this place right on the ocean which was just gorgeus!!! And so were the waiters let me tell you! The one we had was to die for and he was only like 18 (hehe only).  &nbsp; Leaving on a Jet Plane!! That night we finally boarded at 10:30 but it was well worth it let me tell you! The first flight from Hawaii to LA was kinda boring I mean I sat next to my mom and acctually slept for like the whole 5 hours!! I was soo happy and so after that we had an hour and a half and since my dad flies ALL THE TIME we got to go into the admirals club and hang out there for a while and get on computers and watch tv and stuff so that was nice but what was really nice was what was in store for me!! Me and Mitchy were grouped together b/c the other seats were by the exit and we werent old enough so we were sitting and waiting for the person who would be sitting next to me and then he comes...... DUN DUN DUN!!! but no it was far from that! He was FINE!! So it was a nice surprise!! And so we got to talking and stuff because we were both pretty bored and he asked if i was flying by myself because he was because he was and was&nbsp;visiting his cousin who lives in McKinney and stuff and he ended up being 16 and his name was David&nbsp;and lives in LA!! Rich Boy?? hmm He was just so sweet and Mitchell saw us talking and eventually we both got to sleep and are asleep for like an hour. After we are off the plane I ask Mitchell if I fell on him (Mitchell that is)&nbsp;when I was asleep because I tend to move my head a lot I guess when I sleep and he said "no but you fell on that kid" and I started freaking! I was like are you serious!! And I thought I was saved when I thought he was a sleep too and he said he was asleep until I fell on him!&nbsp;Right now I still dont know if he is lying or not but I think he is. I am kinda freaked though!! But its not like Ill see him again so I guess its ok but he was just sooooo fine!!!! grrrr!!! Why did I have to fall asleep?!? lol &nbsp; &nbsp; Well thats all for now i love you  heather

      Today I went driving again at 12 and I did the freeway!!! OMG I had so much fun even though I got called a crotch grabber AGAIN and a dripper! I feel verbally abbused by Kathy lol jk I love that lady. But anyway my next driving class I take my test and then I am like almost done. All I have to do is come in a do parallel parking and now I have observed it twice so I think ill be like a master at it. lol it is sooo boring! Anyhoo after I drove I went to dance and omg!! I guess I worked really hard or am just plain out of shape because I got soo tired by the end. We worked on our orbitz a lot again and did A LOT of just jumping up and down in jazz and did this new thing and I cant reallyu think of what it is called. and then in hip hop the combonation we did was like all legs and almost no arms. Which  I really really love but it can take a lot out of you if your not prepared for it. But I am happy because today in jazz I got my double pirouette!! Except I am having trouble spotting both turns. Like i get my first one spotted and then my 2nd is like lost. I dont know..whatever! But other than all that crap I had so much fun today! We did the cutest combo for hip hop and I think I acctually remember it...maybe! lol Anyways tomorrow I leave for Hawaii! At 2 o'clock and then we land in LA at 5 our time 3 their time and are there for 3 hours which sucks and then we take off again and finally arrive in Hawaii 5 1/2 hours later. Which is like 1:30 our time and only like 8:30 their time. I am going to be soo screwed up! But whatever!! Feel free to text me at any time. I will be back next Thursday if you want to do anything then just give me a buzz!! I love you heather

         OMG my mom and dad got our cell phone bills for the past 2 months and mine was 251.86!!! Mine is like never that high and i dont know what i did. I like never make phone calls during the day or anything. My dad has a feeling that since I was the last phone added that i get all the junk on mine and all the extra stuff on my bill and stuff and like when we went to St.Louis my dad forgot his charger so my phone was used as his, mine, my moms, and my little brothers (my older brother will not let anyone touch his) i dont know. i was just like shocked when I found out and stuff and so was my brother and my dad so he went to the store and they found out they made a mistake but we still owed like 300 dollars total. Its cRaZy!!! My dad really isnt that upset because he never told me that I couldnt do certain things and stuff and since it is during the summer and I was kinda bound to go over at sometime. But I am now supposed to use my house phone to make calls during the daytime (unless its past 9 or on weekeends). So ask me if you want my home number!  i love you guys!! heather

      I am stuck between this HUGE rock and a hard place!! I dont really know what to do. How come whenever you think you have something really really really good coming your way and is in your grasp there is always something that has to come in your way. Sometimes it is a really good thing and sometimes its a really bad thing and sometimes its just annoying like mine. Annoying because you dont know what to do. You dont want to do one thing because you afraid youll look like you want something and you dont want to do the other thing because your afraid you will hurt someone. i am soo clueless and have no idea what to do!

      OMG!!! I think i am done trying to get some color on my skin! I have always been really really pale and I really dont care because i have now gotten used to my skin color but sometimes the jokes inside the family can get to you. So i have decided that im going to  try  to get tan or at least some color. So today I went and laid out with tanning lotion on for about an hour and guess what color i am now.....pink! I always get red. im not sun burnt just red. ohh well whatever ill try again tomorrow and see if i have any change at all and maybe after Hawaii i will have some more because i will be in the sun a lot. Lets all just say a little prayer...(in the name of the father, the son, and the holy spirit, amen) Dear Lord, Please add  some  color to heather garretts skin because she is just pathetically pale, AMEN! ok well lets see if this works.

          This weekend was so much fun and was like filled with firworks in kinda different ways lol. On Friday i went to the Rough Riders games with Maegan, Mariah, and Erin and we just pretty much walked around the whole time and got on the tv TWICE!! hehe but when we finally did go and sit down in the grass we met this guy names Mike who is the fireworks guy! He was so cool too. We were like annoying him to all capacity but he didnt really care that much. He even gave his watcer bottle to Maegan!! haha she like made out with him! We were trying to get him to like shoot off a firwork for us and like spell our names but he said he couldnt so we had to wait until the end when they won.     Then after the game I went back to Maegans and spent the night and we were like soo out of it. We were trying to do these exercise thingys but they didnt work out that great because we just kept falling over ourselves. Then when we got up around 11:30 or 11:45 we tried to do the exercises again but we failed again so instead we made cookies!! The dough was really really good like the best stuff the two of us has ever tasted but when they were cooked they were like a soufle and then just fell into a pancake and tasted really bad!     After we made all the cookies and stuff we both showered and then went to a firework show in Addison. We went and were looking for hot guys and saw one but then he just kinda disapeared. Then we were going to go swimming and when we were walking out these 3 like 18 or 19 year olds asked us to come upstairs with them. And maegan was like....uhhhh NO! WE ALMOST GOT FREAKING RAPED!!! ahhh. and then one of them like went out to his car or whatever and walked by the pool while we were in it and i swear me and maegan were as freaked as we could get. Then when we didnt think it could get any worse when we were in the hot tub people kept looking out of their windows. Like we kept seeing these mysterious hands in like 3 windows. So we decided to dry off and leave the pool.     After all of this excitment came more excitment! We went into the car and changed back into our clothes and the car would not start! The battery went completly dead, not even jumping it did anything. So we were there just kinda hanging out in the lobby watching SNL and mad tv and then getting on the internet and talking to people from the hotel computer until like 12:30. When I finally did get home i just crashed my bed and went to sleep because i knew today I would have to get up and go to another 4th of  July party and see  MORE  fireworks!

         Today I went to the dermotologist for my hyperhidrosis and he basically said I am hopeless because I have now made an imunity to my medicine so I am going to get surgery to end my hand problem! And my parents are totally for it too!!!! It took a little talking into but they saw how happy I saw when I was reading the pamphlet and the results and so they are going to allow me to get it done!! The best neuro surgeon though that my dermotologist knows is in Arizona so my parents are thinking about going up there for vacation during thanksgiving or christmas and while we are up there I would get my surgery!!! I am soo excited!           I have been looking into it for a while now and know exactly what they do so I am totally ready. All they really do is like open this spot in your chest and clip the nerves for my hands and then also clip some nerves in my underarms. So I guess ill have a little scar on my chest but its supposed to be as small as orthroscopic and i already have some of those scars too so this will be no biggie! This has totally like made my summer the best one ever!! I am soo tired of having this problem and am looking foward to putting an end to it. No more ice cold hands and no more fears!!!          Also today i went driving with my dad just around my neighborhood and my brother got soo uptite. he was like dont change the lumbar, dont run into anything, if you mess up the windows you pay, if you run into anything and ruin my speakers you pay, or this one is my favorite...dont mess up MY car! ohh Im sorry but its MY car too you ass!!!! He is acting like i have never even been in a car before. So when i got outof the car I was sure not to move the seat back or move the mirror or the wheel because he seems to know so damn much that he can just do it on his own!! I know Im so mean but he is just acting like a total jerk. Im not an idiot I know how to treat a car.       Also to make matters like much worse my dad is tempted to cancel our trip to Hawaii! I am like going crazy. When we were in St.Louis they had the annual "blood bowl" badmitten game and my dad threw out his back somehow but it didnt start bothering him until he got home and then yesterday and my brother soccer game he rolled his ankle and is now on crutches so my dad is thinking about not going to Hawaii this summer and going to Austrailia or something during the winter. Im just like whatever! Im still packing though for it because I dont think he will cancel but you never know.      Well I got to go and drive again at SEARS. I am soo scared..I am such a bad driver!! I just can not seem to get it :'( Oh well I guess I will get it sometime soon...I hope.                                        i love you!                                   heather
