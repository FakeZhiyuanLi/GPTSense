						   Not all that far from my computer, to be honest.&nbsp; Well, except for all that time spent acquiring a kitten.&nbsp; Or did the kitten acquire me?&nbsp;   I'll save that tale for another blog.&nbsp;   Right now I'll briefly explain how computers can gobble up your time.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, I wrote and published a few comic books.&nbsp; I also did the lettering (i.e., put the words into the bubbles).&nbsp;&nbsp;The process was simple.&nbsp; I'd fire up Word and use its graphic capabilities to place the balloons around selected chunks of text.   And how did I&nbsp; know where the balloons would appear on the artwork?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the most precise, efficient method possible: I'd guess.   Yes, I'd have the artwork by the side, and use a ruler to give me a rough idea of where the balloon would fit on the page.&nbsp;   Once I'd created all the balloons, I'd print the pages out.   The final step was to cut out each of the balloons and paste them upon the art work.&nbsp; I'd use a special kind of glue stick so that the balloons could be removed without damaging the page.   Of course, I'd have to deal with the balloons which didn't&nbsp;quite fit - back to Word!&nbsp; I also had to deal with my hand cramping when I tried to use the scissor to cut around the less straight sections of these balloons.&nbsp; And for some reason (can you say, "age?" - but not so loud), I needed lots of light in order to cut around those edges, so no late night cut and paste sessions for yours truly.   All in all, not the most pleasant task.   So I decided that this would be the time to do it all digitally.&nbsp; I'd scan the artwork directly into the computer, and draw the balloons right on the page.&nbsp; What could be easier?   What indeed.   &nbsp;  Other than:   -&nbsp;buying a new scanner   - finding software to do the balloons (suddenly, Word wasn't up to the job.&nbsp; Neither was Publisher 2000.&nbsp; Of course, it took quite a while to discover each program was not up to the task).&nbsp; Luck smiled down on me when Serif offered a great deal on DrawPlus 7 - it's a low rent Illustrator, but seems to have enough tools to do the job.   - get proper scans made.&nbsp; Hint: if you want to letter comic book pages, 72 dpi JPEGs will not cut it.&nbsp; I needed to scan in the black and white artwork at 1200 dpi.&nbsp; Suddenly, I was getting gray patches on the scans.&nbsp; It took me two weeks to finally get this straightened out, as I tried all kinds of scanning software (no names, but I was very disappointed by one program that claimed to provide high quality scans, but only provided a week of grief).&nbsp; Once again, Lady Luck goosed me by offering up Canvas 7 on the coverdisk of a computer magazine.&nbsp; Canvas 7 allows me to scan in images and save them as PNGs, which saves a lot of disk space.&nbsp; Better still, Canvas somehow interacts with the HP drivers to give me scans that are crisp and clear with no gray patches.   So there are no complaints on my end.&nbsp; Sure, it takes time to master DrawPlus 7, but I consider that to be a productive use of my time.&nbsp;   In fact, I'll be getting back to that once I post this message!   I'll save the kitten tale for another time.   &nbsp;

						    Cry Me A River, Gorgeous!    Serena Williams lost in yesterday's Wimbleton finals. I found the following paragraphs worthy of comment:    In her post-match remarks, Williams raised eyebrows by saying, "I'm not a tennis superstar. I'm a superstar." Asked to elaborate, she unintentionally gave a hint of what Sharapova may have to deal with in the coming years.   "I can't go out anywhere in the world, especially in America," said Williams. "I'm in Italy and I can't go places. I'm in England I can't walk on the streets. ... I've tried lots of different looks and lots of different hair colours and everything. But it doesn't work. It's like a Britney Spears-type thing, I guess.    Time for a reality check, Ms. Williams. A young woman with your looks and build (woo, what a build!) would command attention even if she had never picked up a racquet and got her image plastered all over the media. Of course, if you weren't such a great tennis player, you probably wouldn't be out anywhere in the world.    Pistol-packing Priest?    Today's Toronto Star carried an article that caught my eye and lifted my eyebrows. It's about a Mexican Catholic priest who sounds like he came straight out of King Of The Hill. Actually, I found this story rather uplifting. It's good to read about people who make a difference, especially those who are over-the-top.   You don't have to be boring to be good!   urlLink Read it here       ME-OUCH?!   Has everyone seen the TV ads for the upcoming "Catwoman" movie?  I adore Halle Berry as much as the next red-blooded male (maybe more!), but I get the feeling something's just not right about this flick.  I guess it's the clip where Halle rubs catnip all over her face.  This scene veers between somewhat silly and somewhat erotic (hey, it's Halle Berry making happy faces!), and I think it's a bad place to be.  The scene where Halle hisses at a dog (is that Alex Borstein?  No, not playing the dog!  She's the dog's owner) and then suggests it's allergies is funny.  If it's meant to be a gentle parody of superheroics, then it might do well.  Otherwise ... well, Ms. Berry looks great in that outfit, so the DVD will find a market among lonely guys.  If there's a sequel, might I suggest Serena Williams play Catwoman's sidekick, Lil' Kitty?  Hard to believe no one pays me to come up with this stuff, isn't it?

						   And so it begins!  I have to start by giving a huge "fin's up" to blogger.com!  I spent a good chunk of my afternoon coding HTML and creating logos for a blog, then I thought, "Maybe I'm missing something here?"  Yes, I was missing a little thing we like to call "simplicity"!  I signed up with blogger.com a few minutes ago, and here I am, typing into my blog.  Did I mention this is FREE?    Oh, and a big tip of the fin to  urlLink Andreas  for de-mystifying blogs in the first place.  It would seem that my brain was clouded by an ebook which claimed to make blogging easy.  But the fog has lifted!

						   The other day I received two separate emails telling me I had been linked to other blogs.  "Excellent!" I thought.  "Someone, no, TWO someones, found my comments worthy of linkage."  So I clicked on the links to check out my cyberspace soulmates.  EGADS!  They were both porn sites!  At first I was confused.  What exactly did I write to make porn sites want to link up with me?  Then it hit me: I was picked up by web bots who were trolling for sites.  And what made my blogs so arresting?  Well, I have mentioned Serena Williams and Halle Berry in separate blogs, and I bet that's what did the trick.  It's kind of sad that porn sites are using the fine names of these two women to promote porn.  In the case of Serena Williams, I think she's a fantastic role model.  She embodies a very positve kind of sex appeal.  I think she's very sexy because she's both good-looking and physically powerful.   In an era where female beauty somehow has been defined by stick figures, Serena is a refreshing change of pace.   As for Halle Berry, it's hard to escape her beauty on newsstands, as it seems she's always gracing magazine covers.  In fact, this month she's on four different magazines (how do I know that?  You'll find out soon enough).  On the one hand, it would be easy to dismiss the lovely Ms. Berry as eye candy, but that would be wrong.  A few months ago, I was surfing for information on the upcoming Catwoman movie, and I stumbled across Hallewood!  It turns out that she has an official site.  It's much more than a fan site, because not only does it contain extensive news on Halle's career (such as magazine cover), it actually has a very strong presence from the lady herself.   Now this truly impresses me.  Halle Berry is beautiful, rich, and famous.  She's got an Oscar, for goodness sakes!  She certainly doesn't need a fan club for promotional purposes, and yet she actually makes time to be involved with the Groovers.  This says a lot about the quality of her character, so I think porn sites should leave her alone!  If you want to visit Hallehood, go here:   urlLink http://www.hallewood.com/
