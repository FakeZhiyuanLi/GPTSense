      I went to see Shrek 2 today.  Must get the soundtrack to both it and Shrek part 1.  The movie was really good.  Despite all the screaming kids that were in the theater.  I mean, I like kids, but shit.  I don't like to be in an enclosed theater with hundreds of them.  And the lady sitting next to me felt the need to repeat everything that was remotely funny.  I just tried to go to my happy place and tune everyone out but the movie.

      ...this weekend at Riverfest in Little Rock.  It was really awesome.  My friends and I were totally all up in the mosh pit.  There were peeps crowd surfing and everything.  And just about everybody around me was rockin' the Gonj.  I myself did not partake but probably got a little contact high.  We saw Hootie and the Blowfish on Friday night but the main event was Uncle Kracker and Collective Soul on Saturday night.  They rocked so HARD!!!  I definitely need to go to more concerts.  Nelly and I are gonna see Elton John and Blue Man Group in August when we go to Vegas.  Can't wait!  We also had a Buffy marathon at Nelly's this weekend.  I brought my shiny new season 6 boxset.  We watched multiple episodes and episodes with commentary.  And special features!  So, in other words: my weekend friggin' ROCKED.  And Mandy and Nelly have convinced me to go skydiving in the fall.  The main selling point for me was that they make a video of you skydiving AND YOU GET TO PICK THE MUSIC.  I am totally doing Eye of the Tiger.

      I just drank one of those new Orange Zimas, and guess what?  My ears don't hurt anymore.  I think I'll have another!  5.9% alcohol by volume, baby!

      Had a major false alarm today.  My uncle Robbie calls me at work today, frantic.  He was asking me if I could get over to my Meemaw's house because he was trying to call her.  He said someone kept picking up the phone and it sounded like they were struggling for breath.  My Meemaw has a history of repiratory problems, so I am immediately picturing her lying on the floor of her house, clutching the phone and trying to breathe.  So I jumped up and flew out of the parking lot and called my stepdad.  I was blubbering and hysterical.  Finally I was able to convey to him that I thought Meemaw was in trouble.  So, he called the police and then headed over there himself.  I beat the police over there and it turns out Meemaw wasn't even home.  The police pulled in after me and then Carey.  I'm telling the police officer what's going on and then Peepaw walks out of the house asking what the heck is going on.  He explains to me that they don't know how to work the answering machine properly.  So we went in and listened to the answering machine and it did resemble the sound of someone struggling for breath.  If it hadn't scared the shit out of me, it would be funny.  Maybe I'll laught later.    And to top it all off, my allergies are kicking the shit out of me.  My ears hurt, my eyes hurt, and my head hurts.  And I'm losing my voice.  So, fun, in other words.

      I saw Dodgeball and Fahrenheit 9/11 this weekend.  Both were really good movies for different reasons.  Dodgeball was hilarious.  I don't know why I find people getting hit with balls to be so hilarious.  It just is.  And even more fun, Mom and I popped our own popcorn and hid the bags in her huge purse.  We also snuck in our own sodas.  And my dad had won free movie passes and gave them to me, so we got to really stick it to the overpriced movie theater establishment.    Fahrenheit 9/11 was also excellent.  While I don't agree with everything that Michael Moore says, I really respect the fact that he has the balls to say it.  And it needs to be said.    I think he's a really good film-maker.  He knows how to strike the right nerve and really get all over people.  If you like Bush, I wouldn't recommend this movie.  I personally can't stand him and wouldn't vote for him even if he was running against Satan himself.  The same goes for Cheney, Ashcroft, and Rumsfeld. That's right.  I said it.  Come and get me Patriot Act enforcers.  This movie brought some things to the surface that I had been feeling about the direction our country has taken in the past few years.  And it reminded me that I was still bitter that Gore "lost" the 2000 election.  Moore makes a lot of great points in this documentary and I think he hit the nail on the head a lot better than in Bowling for Columbine.

      So, Mom and I have been doing Weight Watchers for the past week.  And I actually lost 5 1/2 pounds.  Go me!  Mom gained a pound.  And I really haven't been following the point system that strictly.  I've just been generally cutting back.  Eating more veggies and fruits and less fat and sugar.   So, hopefully by August I'll have shed 10 or 15 pounds.    See, WW is all about Portion Control.  Everytime I think about Portion Control I automatically think of Prince's song "Pussy Control".  And one of these days I'm going to be wanting to say portion and actually say pussy.  And that will be funny.

      Well, I got my rejection letter for the job I applied for today.  It was for a staff auditor at the bank I work for.  I'm a little bummed, but I just have to keep on keeping on.  I've got a nice little collection of them that I can add it to.  That kind of helps, that I've been through it before.  But it's never fun to be rejected.  I just have to repeate my mantra:  It wasn't meant to be. Something else will come along. I still have a job. It's not the end of the world.  But the thing is, I hate my job.  It's boring and it's stupid.  But, I'm gonna keep my trademark good attitude and do it to the best of my ability.  But I am keeping my eyes and ears open for new opportunities.  I posted my resume on Monster, but all the responses I've gotten back so far are for sales and shit.  Definitely don't want to go there.  I don't really know what I want to do.  If I could be anything in the world I would either be a writer, a rock star, or a web designer.  I think I'm gonna do something to make that happen.

      I hate summer television programming.  There isn't jack shit on the tube right now.  So I'm listening to NIN Downward Spiral.  I am so bored right now I want to die. And it's too early to sleep.  I finished reading The Dirt by Motley Crue Friday.  That was an awesome book. I am way too obsessed with Nikki Sixx right now.    I also did something I shouldn't have.  I went to Best Buy and spent 60 bucks on my charge card.  I got Guns N Roses Greatest Hits, GNR Welcome to the Videos DVD, Motley Crue's Greatest Video Hits DVD, and Best of Van Halen Vol 1.  I seriously get a high from spending money.  It's as bad as a drug addiction.  My name is Cherri, and I'm a shop-a-holic.    I compiled my list of top ten favorite songs at work this week:  01. Total Eclipse of the Heart -- Bonnie Tyler 02. November Rain -- Guns N Roses 03. Wish You Were Here -- Pink Floyd 04. Dedicated to the One I Love -- The Mamas and the Papas. 05. When You Say Nothing At All -- Alison Krauss 06. Lady Stardust -- David Bowie 07. Bohemian Rhapsody -- Queen 08. Origin of Love -- Hedwig and the Angry Inch 09. American Girl -- Tom Petty 10. At Last -- Etta James  Some are new additions like Lady Stardust and Origin of Love.  But Total Eclipse of the Heart, November Rain, and Bohemian Rhapsody have been on there for quite some time.  The list probably won't stay the same forever.  It's an ever-changing thing.  I should probably do movies too:  01. The Silence of the Lambs 02. LA Confidential 03. Chicago 04. O Brother, Where Art Thou? 05. Hedwig and the Angry Inch 06. Young Frankenstein 07. Pulp Fiction 08. Ferris Bueller's Day Off 09. The Abyss 10. 28 Days Later  It's really hard to do a list of movies because I have seen and loved so many.  My list doesn't include some the of the masterpieces like Braveheart and the Color Purple (both of which I liked).  But I was trying to be honest about the movies I really love and could watch over and over again.

      I've come to the conclusion after watching VH1's 100 Most Metal Moments that Motley Crue fucking rocks.  Er.... rocked.  Well, anyway, they are very cool.  And Nikki Sixx is hot.  I am disturbed by the fact that I am attracted to men who wear makeup.  I'm seriously going through a metal revival.  I'm on my like, seventh rejoining of the BMG music club.  This round I'm stocking up on Motley Crue, Skid Row, Kiss and similar.    And about the skydiving.... I don't think I can do it.  I have this fear that I will become un-strapped in mid air and have a long, slow plummet to my death.  Not cool.  I just can't shake it so I don't think I'm gonna do it.  I know, I'm a wuss.  I've come up with some things I would like to do in my lifetime:  1.  Learn to play the guitar. 2.  Write a novel. 3.  See a show on Broadway. 4.  Marry Ben Affleck. 5.  Take over the world.

Good news.&nbsp; I lost two more pounds.&nbsp; That makes a grand total of 14.&nbsp; Gnarly.

      Okay, so I'm hopelessly addicted to VH1.&nbsp; I watched I Love the 80's Strikes Back all freakin' day.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did take a break to watch Road Warrior which is like the coolest action movie EVER.&nbsp; Assless chaps.&nbsp; The single shoulder pad.&nbsp; The Ayatollah of Rock N Rollah.&nbsp; What is there to NOT like about the movie.&nbsp; The senseless slaughter of Max's dog was NOT cool, however.&nbsp;   Oh, and I lost another pound last week.&nbsp; That brings the total to 12.&nbsp; I'm worried cause I'm going to Vegas next week.&nbsp; And I plan on eating my bodyweight in shrimp.&nbsp;

      Wow.&nbsp; I haven't written in a while.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; I've been busy.&nbsp; Oh fuck it.&nbsp; I've actually been to lazy.&nbsp; Me?&nbsp; Busy?&nbsp; I think not.  Well, I have lost a total of 11 pounds on Weight Watchers as of last Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp; I go to weight tomorrow.&nbsp; Fingers crossed.&nbsp; I'm kind of wishing I hadn't just eaten that peanut butter and jelly sandwich.&nbsp; But how I love the PB & J.&nbsp; Foul temptress!  I had to go to Lowell today for training.&nbsp; It was a colossal waste of time.&nbsp; But that's the company's time.&nbsp; Not mine.&nbsp; It just meant I got to get out of the office for a few hours.&nbsp; AND I stopped at the mall in Fayetteville and did a power shop.&nbsp; So I actually ended up getting back to work about 30 to 45 minutes later than I should have.&nbsp; I chalked it up to "traffic".&nbsp; What my boss doesn't know....&nbsp; I'm such a fucking rebel.&nbsp; I ended up buying a pair of black basketball shorts just like my blue ones that I love so much.&nbsp; AND this store called FYE had the Brides of Destruction cd.&nbsp; I am listening to it right now.&nbsp; It's pretty awesome.&nbsp;   Only a week and a half till Vegas!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; The Sunday after I get back, the girls and I are going to see KISS in concert in Little Rock.&nbsp; Saliva will be there too!&nbsp; Yayness.&nbsp; It's gonna be so awesome.

      I've been reliving my guilty pleasure movies.  I watched Wayne's World one night last week because I couldn't sleep.  Tonight I am watching Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.  Which prompts me to make a guilty pleasure movie list:  Wayne's World Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure Deuce Bigelow: Male Gigolo Dumb and Dumber Weird Science Buffy the Vampire Slayer Hairspray Cry-Baby Spaceballs Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back   Oh, and check this shit out.  I am going to see KISS in Little Rock on August 8. With Nelly and Mandy.  I am so jazzed.  That's right after I get back from Vegas.  So I am seeing Blue Man Group, Elton John, O and doing the Star Trek Experience AND seeing KISS in the span of one week!  I am so excited I can't sleep!  I need a sedative!

      Okay, I watched VH1 entirely too much this weekend.  Seriously.  I watched I Love the 70s all day Saturday.  I wanted to watch I Love the 80s on Sunday but I had to go be with my family because it was the 4th.  Pfaw.  Nah, we had fun.  I did my traditional interpretive sparkler dance.  And Monday it was a metal fest.  When Metal Ruled the World, Guns N Roses Behind the Music, and 100 Most Metal Moments.    Friday night I went to see White Chicks with Rebecca from work.  It was pretty funny.    Oh, and I lost 2 1/2 more pounds on Weight Watchers.  That's a total of 8 in two weeks.  I celebrated by scarfing down a quarter pounder with cheese and fries.

      Well, as of tonight my vacation has officially ended. I had a great time. It all started Monday August 2nd at 3am. I caught a flight out of Fort Smith Regional Airport and made my way to Las Vegas by 8:20 west coast time.  That afternoon we checked into the lovely Bellagio Hotel and Casino. It was excellent. Very posh. We had dinner at The Buffet, which was also excellent. I ate way to much. Then we headed down to the Luxor to see the Blue Man Group. This was such a great show. I was really surprised at how good it was. It was just pure fun. And it was something you could bring kids too, but it wasn't too juvenile. After the show we walked around a bit then went back to the hotel as I had been up a full 24 hours at this point.  Tuesday we woke up bright and early and had the Buffet for breakfast. Even better than dinner. We then headed over to Bally's to catch the monorail. The monorail is a godsend by the way. We took it to the Hilton where the Star Trek Experience is located. I had already done the Klingon Encounter so I was really psyched to do the new Borg Invasion 4D. It was pretty good, but you really have to let yourself get into it. The people who acted in the "ride" were very good. There were borg "chasing" you through the underbelly of a space station. You even got "assimilated". Well, sort of. But then Janeway had to show up and save us. I wish it was Picard or even Sisko. But anyway. Then we did the Klingon Encounter. I have to say I enjoyed the Klingon Encounter ride more than Borg Invasion. But the actors on Borg Invasion were better. Then we sat at Quark's bar. I had some Romulan Ale and Klingon Bloodwine. I can't remember what Nelly had.  That evening was Elton John. Elton Fucking John. I was so star-struck. I couldn't believe I was actually in the same room. The show was amazing. He was amazing. I only wish we hadn't been sitting by a bunch of squares. No one in our row was singing along. I was all bopping my head and singing. I wanted to get up and dance. The people on the first 3 rows or so got to go up on stage during the last song. Bastards. But he did all the greats. Bennie and Jets. Rocket Man. Those two are my favorites. And there was a big screen behind him where they had these specially made videos playing. In the video for Philadelphia Freedom there was a little bit of nudity, i.e, breasts. Two people in front of us got up and left. Prudes. I don't care if he was eating babies on the stage. After paying 200 bucks, I would not leave. For any reason. I can't remember which song it was, but at one point I'm watching the stage and Nelly taps my shoulder. I look over and there is a giant pair of inflatable breasts hanging from the ceiling. I was like "where the hell did that come from?" There was just so much going on. Not a dull moment.  The next day was checkout at noon. We spent the morning at the pool, got dressed for dinner and then checked out. Nelly decided she wanted to ride the roller coaster at New York New York and I wanted to gamble. So we split up for a bit. Then we met back up and decided that we wanted to smoke, drink, and gamble all at the same time. So we got flavored cigars and sat at the bar and ordered cosmos. The bartender had to help us light the cigars cause we are tools. The cosmos were good and we both lost about 20 bucks at video poker. So we were done with that.  Next was our fancy dinner at Le Cirque. That's french. I had another cosmopolitan. And some very rich food. This will come into play later.  After dinner we headed to 'O' by Cirque du Soleil. Also French. It was just amazing. They were doing some crazy acrobatics. My favorite part was when they did the diving. It was very good, except for all the damn clowns. I know they have to have transitions, but damn. Too much clown stuff.  After that we had to catch a taxi to the airport. By this point (about 10:30 -- we've been up since about 7am) Nelly and I are both exhausted. We've had quite a bit of alcohol and quite a bit of food. We barely speak in the taxi. We part ways at our respective airlines. The lady at my airline calls me "sir." I make it to my gate. Then the Risotto and Cosmopolitans hit me. Trip to bathroom. I finally get on the plane about 12:45 am. Been up since 7, mind you. The stew tries to make small talk, I'm like, just give me my fucking coke and be gone. So I drink my coke and plug in my Mp3 player and listen to Elton John. I fall asleep and wake up about 2 hours later with a splitting headache. I felt like my head was going to explode. We finally land in Dallas and I somehow make it to my gate. It's about 5 am central time at this point. I wait will almost 9 and finally get on my plane back to Fort Smith. I finally get back to FS around 10:30, wait for baggage and then get home about 11. I was tired needless to say.  So I go to my Weight Watchers meeting on Saturday fully expecting to have gained like 90 pounds.  But I lost 4!  That makes a total of 18.  Yay me!  I guess it was all the walking.  Saturday afternoon I leave for Little Rock to meet Mandy and Nelly for the KISS w/ Saliva concert on Sunday night.  We had planned this for about 2 months, mind you.  I get to Little Rock and meet Nelly at her apartment.  I get out the Buffy DVD's for our night-o-fun, we talk about our trip and stuff and Nelly tells me that the plan is that Mandy is coming over to the apartment with her new boyfriend Zack and then we are going for dinner.  Zack is currently in drug rehab.  Seriously, I'm all for the drug rehab and give him kudos for going through it.  But I really don't think it's the right time for a relationship.  Nelly and I feel the same way about this.  We've told Mandy and she insists that they are taking it slow.  Okay.  So usually when Mandy, Nelly, and I get together we do a Buffy and other assorted DVD's marathon and pig out on junk food and talk and stuff.  So that's what I'm expecting.   We go out to dinner.  We meet Zack.  He seems like a nice enough guy.  I'm reserving judgement.  Then it turns out Mandy is NOT coming over for the sleepover party.  Keep in mind that I have driven over two hours to see her, we have planned this for 2 months, AND Nelly and I have spent the whole week together.  We don't need to catch up.  We're caught up.  I wanted to spend time with Mandy.   Okay.  I can deal with the non-junk food binge.  I'm trying to lose weight.  We still have the concert on Sunday and possibly hanging out time on Sunday.  Wrong.  We call Mandy at around 3 to tell her that we are meeting at the tram stop for the Arena at about 6:30.  She says yeah she'll be there.  She is currently watching a movie with Zack.  Fine.  Then she calls at 6:30 as we are about to leave.  Guess what?  She can't go to the concert because she has work stuff to do.  Bullshit.  She was soooo doing Zack.  I was so mad.   So here we are, an hour before the concert with an extra ticket.  Nelly hangs up the phone.  I say "fuck it" let's just go.  I was steaming mad the whole way there, but then I told Nelly I wasn't going to think about Mandy anymore, I was just going to enjoy the concert.  We agreed to to just that.  Man oh man.  That concert was just.... AWESOME.  That's the only word I can come up with.  Saliva played first.  They did all the songs I like: Raise Up, Always, Click Click Boom, Rest In Pieces plus some from their new album coming out August 17.  I sang my little heart out on Always and Rest In Pieces.  That was just a warm-up.  Kiss comes out.  The place explodes.  Everyone is on their feet.  Everyone's screaming.  I screamed my lungs out.  I am actually whoarse today.  They started with Love Gun.  They did all the greats.  Detroit Rock City.  Unholy.  Got to Choose.  I Love it Loud.   Then during "I Was Made For Loving You", Paul swung out on this rope thing and got really close to Nelly and I.  He swung right above us.  I was going nuts.  I seriously was about to die I was so happy.  I wanted so bad to be able to hit a pause button and stay in the moment forever.  They ended the show with God Gave Rock N Roll to You and Rock N Roll All Night.  I was screaming the lyrics.  It was just such a great experience.  They had all kinds of pyrotechnics, confetti, blood, you name it.  There were people of all ages.  Probably 3 or 4 generations of people.  Past, Present and Future Kiss fans.  These guys have been doing this for over 30 years and they are still tearing it up.  If you ever get the chance to go, definitely do it.
