      so i just got done trying to write an email to someone, and i think i hit my backspace key more than the rest combined (which is logically impossible, i know, but i'm one of those that hits it continually, a little extra just to make sure it's all cleared).  and in the end, after countless rewriting and trying to form complete thoughts, i didn't even send it!  how crazy is that??  i really did have some things to say/ask him, but i couldn't articulate it very well.  as now...

       someone once asked how a married couple of 52 years stayed so long together.  her answer was they just never fell out of love at the same time.  sometimes you sway in towards each other, sometimes you sway together, sometimes one or the other sways the other way (and typically sways back), but when you both sway apart at the same time, that's when it falls apart.  it makes sense to me in my mind, like 2 pendulums swinging side by side.  i totally agree with that, although for completely different reasons than just a few months ago.  there for awhile i was completely guided by emotions and feelings, up/down yo yo of a life.  and some days i would feel the extreme opposite toward a person than i had been, and pray that they didn't encounter the same thing at the same time, because we'd both (falsely) realize that we didn't want this thing anymore.  NOW, i know that it's a mess to be directed completely by emotions, that you make a decision and just do it, but you still encounter that type of pattern in life.  you just don't let it impact you as much as it could if you were directed by emotions only.  now i KNOW this whole paragraph makes no sense, but it does to me and that's about all that matters at this point :)  that said, me and e are having issues and i don't know what to do.  our pendulums have swung apart for a long time now.  and i also don't know why we're grasping so hard to continue what we both have issues with in the first place, especially now.  i'm working on getting the answers.  i am absolutely falling for nick... *sigh*

      ok we're finally on to part 5.  but first i'd just like to say i can do without all the tornados flying through our area.  really, just when i thought a whole day could go by without one, out of nowhere comes one last storm to shake up the night.  i was supposed to go out, but kind of had this gut feeling to not.  so i didn't, and then less than 15 minutes later the storm came rolling in, so i was glad because then my daughters would have been somewhere else and i prefer them to be with me at times like that. i talked to eric on the phone, which was a bit weird because two whole religious issues came up which we apparently disagree on, but he didn't delve into it, he just got really pissed off and shut up.  which really, i'm all for people doing that, that's one of my oldest tricks ever, but if it blocks you from the whole rest of the conversation then let the conversation be over!  every time i tried to get off the phone he was like 'no, no, let's talk' and came up with some bull.  so anyways i'm curious as to where he stands on the subjects, but like earlier he didn't want to tell me because it'd color my views on it, but i hate to tell you that's not the way things work with me.  ah well, enough of that. well wait, so THEN after the storms he ended up calling again, and this time he was playing video games and had his little headset on so he could be handsfree and play, and i told him i'd just talk to him later because i have a strong aversion to talking to people while they play video games, it drives me crazy!  he of course said he would stop playing, i was like 'uh huh' and he continued to babble on a few minutes but then all of a sudden he exclaimed something because the other team on his little game just scored.  gah!  he totally put me in the worst mood ever.   finally that whole convo was over after about 30 minutes, he got all pissy because i said i was tired, and i really was at the time, but now i'm wide awake :)  i've been busy uploading lots and lots of pics onto my other websites.  i'm hoping to get an actual site here soon, i have the whole site created and am working on it, but alas it's not ready to go public yet!  soon, and when it does i can't wait! so ok. in pt 4 i think it was, i was talking about random things popping into my head, one is this horrid little thing (and i mean that in the most amazingly good way possible) that nick used to do to wake me up on a couple of rare occasions and no matter what i may be doing in the present every now and again it comes back to me.  mind you this was at least 6 months ago, probably even longer and a lot has happened between now and then but for some reason i remember it like yesterday.  so hopefully if i get it all out then maybe my mind won't find reason to keep recalling it, which i have yet to figure out what the purpose is.  it's not even that big of a thing, really.  basically i would be sleeping, and nick would wake me up by knealing beside me, slooowly lingering his fingers all up and down my arms and across my chest and breasts in a tantalizing random motion, except as it intensified i could almost sense which way he would go, still random as ever... oh my god it about brought me to orgasm a million times.  just by his touch, how crazy is that?  to prevent this from getting too x-rated here, that little memory starts recalling a hell of a lot more that we did together, which is an even more amazing phenomenon that i can remember that stuff!  big bah.  i saw him like 2 or 3 days ago, for less than 2 minutes and he still managed to stir up crap just looking at him!  oh i need help, lol :)

      i'll really be surprised if i still have a job on july 2 :) here we go, part 4:  so as i was saying, if you've actually followed any train of thought there.. things rock in my life.  haven't got an ounce of focus though.  it's been like this for a few days, the ODDEST things have been popping into my head as of late!!  gotta get some focus sometime soon :(  but until then... :)  i really have a problem with women pastors, don't know why, i think i'm just traditional by nature and i prefer male pastors.  yet my whole life i've wanted to be a little speaker and go around to different places like schools and motivate people towards success, and lately that's been more directed to leading in a church.  how twisted is that?  and it's tied into the writing thing, and now when i wake up in the middle of the night with a million thoughts to write down, it's more in line with preachy speeches.  all centered around core sayings which i'm known for, like 'happiness comes from happenings, joy comes from the Spirit' and 'always be grateful for what you have, never be hateful for what you haven't', and my favorite as of late is 'the inner longing you're feeling can't be fulfilled by outside things'.  one day i'll attempt to get them all uploaded here, right now they're half in my head, half in my heart, and the other half (lol) on my laptop.  God help me if anything ever happens to it!! so i also found out something about speaking in tongues, apparently not everyone's up to that.  i encounter it HEAVILY on sunday nights, i'm still on my supernatural high on mondays and i was emailing my friend eric and it came out.  now he's a good God moving man, so i thought nothing of it.  then last night at our bible study the question came up about women who are heavily into speaking in tongues generally becoming partners with men who don't.  and in most modern day couples that wouldn't matter because most don't even pray together, kind of a 'do it in your own time' thing.  but in spiritual couples that could very much make a difference, i know I'D want to experience that both alone and with my future husband, ya know?  and i definitely don't want a husband who doesn't do it at all or even believe in it.  so i ask eric, and wouldn't you know he didn't want to answer or get into it.  it came out that he doesn't do it.  nice.  while i was at it, i asked nick, who does, that was refreshing to hear.  i didn't email lance at all today but knowing his lifestyle he's not even saved i don't think.  just interesting.  i don't like being a novice much because i didn't realize not everyone who's heavily into God is heavily into the tongues thing. well time for another break, pt 5 to come :)

      ok this one is going to be job related, so if you get bored go ahead and skip on, i don't blame ya :)  once again, if you didn't catch the title this is part 3, although once again, i don't know why as it's not a continuation of anything... ah well :)  so i just cleaned off my desk.. i can always tell if it's been a hectic day or not whenever i start to organize all the papers strewn around.  today i counted 6 pens (3 black, 2 blue, 1 red)and 16 paperclips, 1 sharpie, 2 binder clips and my white out thing which is the greatest invention bic ever came up with!  now i don't typically make mistakes to necessitate using the white out thing, but i love it!! here is what my job typically consists of... i get about 5 phone calls a day and coincidentally 5 emails a day (well that's work related, more on that to follow).  in a twisted way i have about 5 bosses.  the best part is, they all think their individual message/email is urgent and needs to be answered right away.  even better is the fact that all of them are always asking about the same issue, which isn't too bad normally, i can just copy and paste and repeat myself.  but when i mess up or am pushing a deadline a little too close for (their) comfort, i get called on it.  5 times.  actually 10, because they all call about it AND email about it.  lordy!  ok the rest of my job is filling out applications, and more applications, and even more applications, which are repetitive and dulling and you can't use the same one apparently so i have to do them over and over.  but at least there are 40 doctors i do this for, so i get a little variety.  except when they are all doing them at once, it gets a bit tricky.  so then i send them to the doctors for their signature, and when it comes back i mail it.  should be easy, right?  not so much.  people are whiny and it drives me crazy!!  so i usually get the applications out, but then they don't always sign them right away, then letters from the companies come asking where are the completed applications, then the docs get frustrated and freak out wondering why it's not done when they are the ones sitting on it.  try telling that to them politely.  so.  that's not all my job entails.  all these docs have about 5 licenses each, all expiring at different times of the year, so i have to coordinate those and make sure they are current and updated copies are sent out to all the companies we work with.  they get demanding too.  oh there's more.. we have 2 new docs and 1 np starting, i have to focus all my time and energy on them because they start july 1 and NOTHING is ready.  my bosses seem to think july 1 is the day after tomorrow.  i'd like to point out that i can't very well do all the work if i'm responding to all of their inquiries but that won't fly either.  my conscience won't allow that because in between doing all of these things i'm emailing all my friends (yay this DID relate to the entry below!!!!) or checking things out on the net, which in all truthfulness i do only when i'm on hold for something work-wise.  like printing.  don't even get me started on my printer.  i can print a 2 page document and get up to go get a coke on a different floor of the building, hit the bathroom, talk to about 7 people, and STILL make it back to my desk before my little sidekick printer is done.  and sometimes it won't print at all, can't handle the flood of data coming to it.  quite humorous :) BUT i AM extremely thankful for this job, because just a few months ago i was working 8 hours a day in a warehouse in 100 degree weather filing papers not knowing where my next check would come from, so at least now i have a permanent job.  just not the job i'd prefer to do permanently.  how's that for irony.  alrighty, back to work, pt 4 to come :)

      here is part 2, if you haven't read the first part scroll down.  although nothing in this post will directly relate to the post below, so i guess read it however the heck you want!  ok my friend eric is really stressing me out.  eric likes to make little comments to confirm his assumptions of me and another friend nick.  so all the time i have to put eric in his place when he makes smart ass remarks to dig in the fact that something is going on between me and nick, although sadly nothing is and i have to reiterate it to eric each time, which in turn puts me in a worse mood than what his remark initiated.  not only that, eric gets more mad and i know it's not me he's mad at, but more himself for 'going there' again, as we've discussed in length before.  i'm sure ya'll know what it's like to have behaviors you despise yet they still slip out.  i used to have that problem, not so much now.  not since... last thursday, lol :)  a whole week, but hey i'm getting better.  so.  that's eric.  nick, well nick's been discussed previously, but i'm coming to satisfaction at just being friends because, well.. ok yea, i must be lying cuz i can't think of anything to justify that comment :P  let's go on.  so hey there's also lance.  lance's been discussed previously as well, we've started emailing again but yea it's like an instant return to empty emails and conversation.  and all the while we were trying this email thing to start it up again, the word replacement kept coming to mind, i have to get over all that mess first before i can get anywhere else, isn't that strange?  used to be i could switch personalities and get around it.  not so much anymore.  wondering what kind of replacement?  well if it looks like n and smells like n and acts like n, doesn't mean it IS n.  and he sure as hell didn't kiss like n!  there was a huge study done one time about people and change, people would actually resort to whatever tactics they had to in order to recreate their life the same as when a big variable changed.  we'll use the dating sense since it's so applicable here, they would find someone sickeningly similar to whomever they were with previously.  i thought it was ridiculous till i realized i was in a pattern with lance where he would come over every tuesday and friday and watch a movie.  weird!  the rest came abundantly clear and that was that, then just as i was breaking away he told me he'd sorta kinda met someone and was starting to see them and wouldn't you know right at that time me and nick started talking again, which i never thought would happen. ok well that could go down lots of roads but it can't right now, my boss is coming.. look for pt 3 soon :)

      so here's what's up today.  it's finally sunny, which is cool, i've been up since like forever which epidemizes why this blog is called sleepyinstlouis, and i have a million things to say.  thus this could be the longest entry ever!  or not, seeing as how i've built all that up, maybe i'll hit writer's block (although i've never had that problem before).  ok well first fundamental: faith, i am LOVING God :)  last night's church experience was AWESOME, which is the same thing i say each and every time, but that's because it's true!  i'm telling you, it's great!  i don't know what i would do/be without that church :)  which brings us to self, and how i've sorta stalled out.  i don't like that.  there for awhile i was having huge issues, then i was kind of on the upswing until i had HUGE breakthroughs, now i'm a bit worried about slipping again but trying not to.  the cycles are completely gone, but not far, i still see the remnants every now and then.  kind of hollow and strange, can't really be explained.  my family life rocks, kay and kin's emotional problems have pretty much been resolved.  i'm still not getting child support, my ex 'mailed' whatever form back in april, then out of his 'good nature' he called to find out why it wasn't being taken out of his check, and they said they never received it.  so he 'faxed' it the other day.  we'll see.  i learned long ago, i don't count on it anymore, if it happens then it's a definite blessing that's for sure!  i'm believing God for it, i know when it does happen it will happen right so yea, just keepin the faith!  oh and the other thing i'm believing God for is the financial aid with Grace, that would rock if we get approved for it, anything would relieve the burden at this point so hopefully they take us into consideration.  have to get her enrollment confirmed first.  that could prove to be harder than imagined.  had some nice financial miracles, then i found out that i have to have my ex sign off to consent them to go there.  which brings us to custody.  right now we have joint which means we split the girls and everything that comes along with raising them basically, which we don't at all, so now i gotta worry about obtaining full custody, the only benefit of which is it's better to get it done and taken care of now, and also the possibility of the child support reviewed because as it's set now it is 200 bucks a month.  a typical case with 2 children gets at least 500 but because he was an ass (ok still is) he wouldn't sign the divorce papers without it being reduced to 200, which nowadays i don't see what the difference is if he doesn't even pay it.  i did find out that i have the potential to sue him for damages of his neglect of child support, because while i'm not able to pay off my credit cards my credit report is shot and i can't qualify for anything with delinquency in payments for the past couple of years.  which if he had been even an ounce consistent with his payments then i could have had a little bit less to pay out of my income for daycare and in turn had funds to pay the bills.  i think in the past year alone i accumulated more interest and $29 late fees and overlimit fees than my yearly salary!  BUT all in all, i'm not too bitter about it, i just focus on paying our regular old expenses and watch how God pulls us through each time!  kind of a challenge!  which reminds me, i went to pay my utilities yesterday, went to the little grocery store to do it vs mailing it in, because i don't have a checking account i would have to pay a buck for the money order and then the 37 cent stamp, etc.  so.  i go and usually they have to do it off the debit card and they charge 1.50 for that.  which is ok because for that card i would have to pay to withdraw the cash in order to buy the money order, still cheaper with the store's little fee.  the gosh darn card is bent, and it wouldn't read right.  so i had to go over to the atm, which is of a bank that i detest, and pay 2 bucks to withdraw the cash (the atm took the card just fine, of course).  i then go back to give her the cash, and they still charged a 50 cent fee.  i was trying my hardest not to laugh, because it was quite comical, and the lady was trying to justify the fee after i was like 'still a 50 cent fee?'  anyways then she made some remarks about how i owe oh $175 and only paid $45 on it and i was like well i obviously don't have money to throw around in fees then do i?  but i didn't say it of course, thanks self-control lol.  whew. onto internet.  here are my thoughts.  this whole dial-up/dsl/cable thing really confuses the heck out of me!  i don't know why it seems so complicated to me, but it is.  i feel so sorry for my friend because i couldn't grasp the concept and kept asking more and more questions about it.  then he said something about seeing it in person so now i'm hoping i can see his and maybe then i'll get it.   ok i'm hardly working here so this is going to have to be part 1 to be continued later :)

      i love tornados.  i was just talking to my friend about them today in fact.  and an hour later along comes a tornado.  first it went from graylight outside (graylight is daylight when the sun is behind the clouds all day, seeeee?) to completely green/black in about 30 minutes.  quite strange, looked like the Spirit was making his way down.  then, well... actually in the interest of saving time i'll just copy and paste some email passages... THIS WILL BE REVISED SOON SO CHECK BACK! We just had a tornado.  (to my pal in another city)  I am dead serious.  I am on the 2nd floor with floor to ceiling windows and for straight 15 minutes it was straight golf ball size hail and 90 mph winds and the trees are all stripped of leaves.  I am scared to go see my car.  The road is completely covered in hail, it looks like a sheet of ice.  And now it’s all hazy outside because it’s steaming up, can’t even see your hand in front of your face.  Oh AND the downstairs here is flooded, the ground level.  I feel sorry for the little geese.  (there are geese that live very close to our building's location.. and they just had babies too!)  Hey there was a tree out on the golf course across the street, well it’s nicely chopped in half now!  (the tree looks like someone haphazardly took a saw to it)  Yup I just talked to them, they still have power.  Which is good, because our building doesn’t.  which is actually REALLY good because there is half a foot of standing water downstairs and that’s just an electrocution waiting to happen! (he asked if i'd called to check on my girls)  Oh heck yea, there were really bad storms overnight too, and this isn’t even done yet, we should have another really large cell in about 30-40 minutes. (woo hoo!)

        so my therapist (who i've been released from by the way) before our final session last friday she had asked me to prepare an outline of ways that i've changed since we started this whole process way back when.  topping my list was that i've gained weight.  how is that improvement?  i don't likely know.  but i do know that it's made my breasts even bigger, for those of you who don't know me i thought that was rightly impossible, but nevertheless they are now a nice juicy fleshy pair spilling over a tiny pink bra.  and to make matters worse, my sister, who has always hated my body in the first place, is now convinced i'm pregnant.  which is impossible, because just last week i celebrated my 6 months of being sex-free, a huge deal for me.  now the good thing is my stomach hasn't been the house for the newly added weight, it's all pretty much gone to the appropriate places for curves, so i'm not big in that area whatsoever.  yet she still kept pushing me to admit that i was pregnant and hypothesising who the father was, as if all she thinks i do in st louis is have sex with various men.  anyways i'd seen my sister this past weekend, and then the next thing i know, my mom calls, starts asking if there is something i haven't told her yet, leading into that she'll still love me if i'm pregnant because she knows how i always get into these messes.  LORDY!  i can't weight (lol) for my sister to get over her bulemic crap so i can start making comments about her!

      well i finally did it, i bought myself a vcr.  it's a cute little lightweight sort, quite impressive the way these things have advanced, but it's a gray/silver color, and i really prefer black.  but it was pretty cheap, so what do you do?  i also bought the girls these little balls that are about 6 inches in diameter.  it was their reward for something quite silly, but i said i would buy them whatever they wanted, and i like to maintain my integrity and follow through so off to walmart we went.  it was supposed to be pretty simple, they wanted a soccer ball so that we could take it to the park and kick around, practice for kaylee's upcoming soccer league, but then kinadie said she wanted a basketball.  so i agreed, we get about 2 aisles away from the sports crap and their little eyes lit up at something totally different.  there, on clearance (yay), were about 25 little plastic balls of assorted shapes and sizes and themes.  Barbie, Bob the Builder, Clifford, Spongebob, you name it, they had it.  OH and they even had TMNT, which i really pressured the girls to get, but to no avail.  we spent about 15 minutes trying to figure out which ones to get, there were so many of them it was crazy.  it was a good lesson on how everything else seems better than what you have in your hands.  they'd yell 'that one!' and i'd give it to them, they'd glance down maybe for 2 seconds before scanning the basket again to pick out another.  we finally settled on 2 and took them home, and actually now the balls are at the school for show and tell. i really wish we had a house with a backyard that they could play in a lot.  i mean, the park is nice, and it's not very far from our apt, but still you have to drive there and it's a bit harder to just get up and go play outside for a few minutes whenever the mood strikes.  ah well, in due time i suppose :)

       things with lance always seem to come back right at the best times!  i haven't seen him since the whole texas chainsaw massacre ordeal and then last week he sent me an email.  i was like ah cool, not too sure what to make of it all, then last night he called wanting to come over.  which i gotta tell you was nice, the phone call part i mean, he didn't end up coming over because i had too much to get done, but we did talk for quite a bit.  so then we were emailing this morning that he wanted to get together this weekend, go out to dinner and what-not some night.  i told him i couldn't today, because of church, i couldn't really do anything saturday because of grace that night (unless he wanted to do something that afternoon, then i retracted that cuz i have a lot of errands to run), and sunday will be pretty much filled all day with church.  he was cool with it, after asking like 3 times if those were just excuses, and then that was that. anyways that whole episode there revealed some good points...

       happy is an emotion, up and down, yo yo of a life, who wants that?  what you are wanting is an underlying joy, a peace, a security.  more on that later.  and for the record, i sure as hell never believed all that i just stated, it's all due to a lovely inner shift i've had.  but hey i'm not complaining!   i ache to share it, but then the insecurity creeps in.  and i know he doesn't give me the spirit of fear, God opens the doors and it's up to me to push through it.. but... the devil stops in and says 'you're way too forceful!  you're a novice!  you don't know what you're talking about!  they will only laugh at you!  they don't care!  it sounds too good to be true!'   and the other thing that is getting me is the fact that they need to recognize that they are lost.  a lifeguard always has to restrain from saving someone who is flailing around, they have to seriously wait until that person is tired and worn out before they can go in and save them, or else they're likely to be pulled under too.  but you don't know if they've recognized how lost they are, until you speak to them and the spirit works his way in there and starts to convict them.  make them think, ya know... maybe there's something to this.  they have what i want.  what i'm doing sure as hell ain't working.  it could be worth a try.  when you are so done with this life that you just don't want this anymore, when you just wish him to take it all away, he will!

      i asked spirit for guidance on this whole nick situation, i've been feeling the little inklings but not paying much mind.. i guess trying to contradict them?  but recurrently feeling like he always has so much going on, it's not going to change anytime soon (it can, but it's not), need to look at where this is headed and get out now before a year passes and we're not any further and i whine that it's too late to try to recover loss time and start anew with someone else.  and i know that's all feelings, and some of that is fear-driven from my mind, and i need to KNOW with my spirit.  so i asked spirit last night for a little guidance here. and then this morning i asked nick about him coming to the door and me assuming it was an opening to a kiss and might have been wrong.  he said "I dunno, I guess both, didn't really give it much thought, been so preoccupied with everything else going on right now, I just don't know what to think about anything anymore, I'm just trying to stop from going insane at this moment." GAH.  that just about ripped me down to the core.   ask and you'll get the answer.  i asked nick, he told me straight up.  i asked the spirit, he told me straight up.  now it's a matter of acting on the knowledge i gained... that could prove to be harder.

      well i went over there after work, it was kind of nice because i am so used to fighting gridlocked traffic on my normal way home, and on the way to nick's i didn't encounter that.  so i get there, and i wasn't sure whether to come in or not, he didn't really invite me in and i didn't ask, i just kinda walked in the entry and he walked on to the couch and i motioned like a dork at the door whether to close it behind me or not.  he said some joke comment like 'don't be scared' so i sat down for a spell.  it was alright, kinda awkward, kinda not.  it was nice and light, just joking around with each other and all that.  i only stayed for about 30 minutes, then i had to leave to go get the girls and head to church.  so i got up to leave, and he kind of got up to walk me out, like close the door i guess, but i went back toward him and we gave each other a quick peck and then that was it.  he followed me to the door and pressed up behind me and i think in there there might have been another quick kiss and then i left.  but in hindsight i think those may have been a mistake because he was probably just coming to the door to see me out and close it behind me, and especially with him coming up behind me that was probably because i abruptly stopped at the door because i got fascinated by the handle.  which reminds me, i also managed to make a nice fool of myself a couple of times, my level of common sense is definitely not par with everyone else's it seems.  i really do like him, i like going over there and seeing him, and i'd love to do it more and see if there's a future to this, but i don't think it's reciprocated, especially not to the same level.

       i think the devil knows exactly which buttons to push in order to trip me up.  for a long time he ruled supreme, but i was healed of a lot of things recently, eliminating his effects, and now he is resorting to the worst.  ohh it sucks!  when it strikes, it's just.. debilitating.. i break out into a full on anxiety attack and have to switch myself out of it.  and it strikes at the oddest times, not even provoked by anything!  like on a wednesday afternoon or occasionally late at night, or while driving in my car.  that's the worst, because i start to freak out and lose control and can really get into a mess then.  the only time he can't touch me is when i'm at church, i learned that real quick, and that is probably my main motivation in going 24/7.  that and my unsatiable thirst for more of God.  and i know that God stays with me when i walk out of that church, but the devil still strikes and it shakes me up.  i don't like it.  i can't even think about the topic here without it starting to deeply affect me.  this sucks.

       oh i'm going by nick's house today to drop off that form..  i'm kind of excited yet kind of nervous as well, i don't know why.  i'm excited that i'm going to see him, that in of itself is exciting, but at the same time i don't know under what context, and don't know what to expect stay-wise, like if i should just knock on the door and give him the paper and that's it, or give him a quick kiss goodbye, or come in for a few minutes and stay a bit, or what?  ack!!!

      The other thing that’s being dealt to me is Nick.  God is changing his life 180 degrees, like his changes at work, new house, new car, etc.  God is changing Nick inside and out, and I am so excited for him!  It's like God is raising the bar in his life, if he's ready to step up to the next phase he'll find what he's been yearning for.  Nick is really headed somewhere exciting and purposeful in life... and I don’t want to hold him back by any means, and I don’t want to compete with him as I accelerate in my own, rather I wish for those two things to compliment each other, to strive to make each other better and lift each other up.  Ah I just want to stand in faith for him and support him and be a part of his life.  If only he were willing.   I really want to ask him if he believes this is something to pursue... and if so then I want to do it right, like foundation-wise, I don’t want this to be a sporadic once-a-month or whenever we can get a chance to hook up, because we both have so much going on in our lives that there wouldn’t be enough there to like… well, ya know how especially in the beginning it needs cultivating and a little cocoon in order to develop and stuff.  It’s like the night when the phone was ringing like crazy, can’t get into the groove and reach substance because just when you get to that point the phone rings and pulls it away or distracts and the moment is gone.  Whether that’s the devil halting because he is clamoring to knock this down and prevent what we could become, or it’s God halting us and trying to deter us and steer us in the right direction.  I know that Nick would want to think long and hard on that, or rather he’d probably say he doesn’t have time to think about that right now.  But I also am aware that the answers don’t come from the mind, in fact that opens the door up to doubt and over-analysis and fears from the devil, rather get into the spirit and the Spirit will take from Jesus and reveal to him.

      I am sooo tired, and not just physically, although 'sleepy in st louis' is definitely due to lack of actual sleep.  It's just... ever get to the point where you just have SO MUCH going on?  Like at work, I feel like I'm one of those little people performing at a variety show, spinning a bunch of plates atop some contraption, trying to keep an eye on them all and when they start slowing down, going back and forth to give them a little extra spin to keep on going.  Afraid one of them could come crashing down at any moment, causing a domino effect, yet at the same time secretly hoping they would just so that I could have a break and rebuild, hopefully better this time.

      Well seeing as how it's the first entry, here is the typical 'this is me' post:  First off, my name is [edit], I'm 26, and live in St Louis.  If you know me, no explanation is needed, and if you don't, no explanation is possible :)

      ...or so my sister is convinced.  her husband has been accessing it at work.  now here is where my double-standards come in, because i am amazingly not cool with him doing that, but i don't see anything wrong with porn.  i don't think it's bad per se, i mean like all things when it gets to the extreme nature of it and all that, there's a rather evil side to it.. but i kind of see it more as another medium of experiencing sexual pleasure :) but with him doing it there are all sorts of problems, like him lying about it, like him doing it at work, like him keeping it a secret, like the nature of how bad it is, like his attitude towards being a victim to it, like how he has chosen a strict work environment and lifestyle so he should not participate in it, etc.  my sister is convinced it is a sin because he was lusting after other women, it's the same thing as committing adultery.  to which i disagree, basically because when it comes to actually LUSTING after other women, he doesn't even know these people, that's like women going crazy for brad pitt or something, they're still true to their marriage and stuff, nice to look at but they know they have the best of what's real at home.  it's not like he knows the girls, but then that opens up a can of worms and leads to objectifying women because it's not THEM he's lusting after, just that the pics and stuff arouse him.

      i know i'm on the verge of something good when all hell breaks loose.  this is a quick rundown of my past week: i made a spiritual decision to let go of some things that were holding me back, actually causing me to regress, and thus open up the passage to be able to take some big steps in the right direction.  my grandma died, i encountered financial struggle, i had to miss work at the most inopportune time, i had a horrid return to work when i did go back, i had to pay a nice $250 for my kids to attend daycare just two days and a rigid businessman who wouldn't cut slack off the price, next i found out my best friend e was in a really bad car accident on the highway late one night and is not doing well at all, and then the next day i found out my brother in law is dealing into internet porn at his work, which just happens to be in the most rigid church environment, not to mention the impact this is having on my sister who's married to him..  so all this is happening, a lot of distractions popping up to rid me of focus and throw my mind into a whirlwind, just when i thought i had gained clarity.  and i have no doubt in mind that i'll even get a chance to see n this week and it will go so well that it will throw that 'well, maybe' hope back in there and.. gah this is just what i had determined to let go of so i can accelerate my advancement..

      i think today was one of the top five worst days at work yet!  it started off with me returning to work after missing a few days, and my boss came up to me and said we were going to have a nice big meeting about the two new docs starting july 1 and how nothing is ready.  so there's that.  and THEN maybe another hour into my day my other boss came up to me and chit chatted about my grandma's death and then dropped a bomb of a project i need to complete asap about one of the new docs starting july 1.  and then somewhere in there one of the main doctors called and cussed me out because a few doctors were going to be losing their privileges at a hospital because of a project i didn't get done.  which i couldn't have done since i missed work and i made a special note of it to my boss to get done while i was gone, but he only did one doctor instead of all of them.  so i had to deal with that mess, plus prepare everything for the big meeting.  it ended up being that i saved the hospital privileges, i had to drive a bunch of papers up to the hospital and prayed that it would be resolved.  in between all that i had to make about 20 phone calls to people to find out what's going on with the 2 doctors starting.  my boss asked for the update and said he would take it in for the meeting, so i thought i would get out of it, but then i got called in anyways... bah.  that whole thing sucked.  after all that it was almost 5 and time to go, but then one of the new docs called so i talked to him a bit.  i still had to do my regular duties so i got a few more things done to leave by 5:30 and wouldn't you know it, my boss came up to tell me the exciting news that we are hiring one more doctor!  by july 1!!  i was like, do you know that is sooo not possible?  it should be interesting to say the least, i think my hopes of going part-time in august are quickly going to change to hopes of ANY job in august..

      so yea let's catch up.  i didn't end up going out with that guy on friday.  and as previously stated i didn't end up getting to go to nick's to pick up that tape, but after work i did call to see if i could still get it but he didn't call me back.  so yea, oh well to all of that.  friday night i went to church instead, that rocked.  saturday morning i woke up at like 4 and prayed about whether to go back to my hometown to see my grandma, she's been sick and hospitalized as of late  and i wasn't sure if she was going to make it another week which was when i was planning to go see her.  so i drove down there saturday, saw her and stayed for awhile, then drove back home.  so then sunday i was supposed to go across the state a different direction and pick up my girls from staying with their dad, but my mom called that morning to say my grandma passed away.  so i had to go get my girls and then drive across the state even more to come back to my hometown.  it was a mess, a good 13 hours of driving in a little over 24 hours.  my car is tore up anyways, i was freakin out, but it is now at the shop being fixed before i have to trek back home in a few days.

      well i am still glad it's friday, although it was slammed down considerably when i found out i won't be seeing nick at all afterall, which a lot was of my own initiative but still sucks.  he taped this show for me which was very cool, but it's been like 4 days and if it's so much work to get together for me to get it/watch it then.. it's just indicative of everything else.  like he couldn't tues or wed and said he'd let me know like on thur or fri.  which at the time was cool, i had a ton to do tues and wed anyways.  but then on thur he's feeling bad, maybe fri.  fri is him still feeling bad but i can stop by and pick up the tape, but then as he's almost ready to leave he comments on how bad he's feeling again, getting worse.  which i don't want to come over if he's feeling bad, and well, you can see how the rest goes.  the weekends he's always busy and by the time next week comes i'll have my girls back 24/7 and the opp will be gone. i have this opportunity to go out on a date with this guy, he seems kind of cool, but i haven't been too willing to pursue anything so far.  but i'm getting the idea maybe i might as well. seems like a ridiculous motivation to go into it with, i'd rather go into it with the idea that something cool could come of it, not just a lackluster oh might as well.   i'll switch around that mindset there :) i'm thinking i may ask if his offer is open to tonight since that all opened up, because well i look really really cute (of course) and am in a flirty mood and, like i said, might as well :)  it'll be nice to go hang out with someone and have some decent conversation and what-not...

       here is something i found that i'd typed up quite a few months ago...  i wonder if he knows about the night i went to his place at 2 in the morning, more lost than i'd ever been, with tears streaming down my face, exhausted of running in the dark of the night with no where to go. i wonder if he was there waiting, unconsciously holding his breath and daring not make a sound, wishing i would go away and waiting to hear my footsteps leave his building. i wonder if he knows that night i wanted to die, i wanted to drive myself off the bridge and often wondered what it would be like if i just did it, just swerved my car to the right in the middle of rush hour traffic. i was in so much trouble that night i didn't know where to turn... the police had issued warrants out for my arrest, i had piles of letters from prosecuting attorneys and more, my phone and utilities had all been shut off, all i could do was sit in darkness... undoubtedly i wanted him, but at that point i wouldn't have cared or held caution to the fact that it wasn't reciprocated, i would've settled for anybody... all i wanted was to get somewhere to make a collect call for help.

      so i talked to eric last night on the phone, the first time in like 2 weeks.  we played phone tag the whole day before, then last night we played phone tag before i actually answered.  we only talked for like 10 minutes before we were both itching to get off the phone.  it's hard to believe this is the same guy that i would have six hour phone conversations with, never to go a day without calling each other.

       do you ever feel like you just want a break?  like stupid things just keep happening, one after another, like little attacks from the devil on your life, and you are just like 'hello God, where are you?  step in here anytime!!'  and you're tired and cranky and frustrated from it all.. and you just want a little break, ya know? there's more to this, a la 'why are you complaining to me?  go forth' but i gotta get back to work now.. stay tuned

      ugh i owe nick an apology.  and it's not even one that i need to verbalize (at least i hope not :)) cuz he doesn't much know that i have this to be sorry for (well  maybe  he does).  it's not like an action like i stepped on his toe and need to say i'm sorry, and it's not like a one-time behavior where i was a bitch and gotta say i'm sorry, but yea i owe him an apology for having expectations that he could never fulfill, even he's told me on more than one occasion in no uncertain terms that he could never be/give me what i want from him.   today was an INCREDIBLE day of learning, from the very best Teacher, and i started to learn some things i never considered.   'started to learn'  is the key phrase here, but good stuff indeed, i'll elaborate soon in another post.  right now i just want to say i'm sorry to nick for holding him to unrealistic standards although he probably doesn't know even how high they were (and nary does he care, probly)...

      so yea, here are my thoughts on the whole missing woman case in utah.&nbsp; i think she took off on her own initiative.&nbsp; seeing as how it was on a monday, and per her usual circumstances, i think she knew it would be the perfect time.&nbsp; any one living in the u.s. has known of the lacy peterson case and i think she used it to her advantage.&nbsp; i think she knew how psycho her husband was, finding out she was pregnant probably drove her into a despair that she needed to get out now.&nbsp; the police need to stop looking for where someone could have murdered her and left her body, they need to be looking where someone could have harmed themselves, if that's what she did, or look where someone could have taken off and gone into hiding/put on new affectations for themselves.

      ahhh now this is better, back to my usual sleeping habits :)&nbsp; i think i was in serious trouble a while ago, actually getting more than 8 hours of sleep in a row is definitely not a good indication of things in my life!&nbsp; my weekend was pretty good, friday i was horrid sick more mentally/emotionally than physically, so i took the day off from work.&nbsp; that was nice in a couple of ways, still emailed nick from home, then when he got off work we still talked online for like another 3 hours before i finally wrote that i was hungry and asked him to do something impromtu.&nbsp; i hate doing that because he usually says no, so i think it threw me off guard that he said yes.&nbsp; the topic of conversation the previous 3 hours should have guaranteed it tho ;)&nbsp; so i did end up seeing him, which rocked because i'd kind of accepted in my head that i wouldn't be seeing him for like another month it seemed.&nbsp; although i think the month would have been divine timing, sometimes i really think i need to stay away from him until i can get self control under my belt.&nbsp; especially with being under this depression, i started digging into some pretty deep stuff which left me raw as hell and in that i always resort to sex as my only way to relate and my God that friday i was incredibly sexually crazed!&nbsp; anyhoo, saturday was ick, i was horrid sick,&nbsp;and it was no good.&nbsp; i don't ever get sick physically, it's literally been since 11/2003 and yet here i was sicker than ever.&nbsp; and i was emotionally sicker than ever too, i was really scared of doing the bad stuff again.&nbsp; i wanted to call nick, i wanted to call eric, i needed to call on God i think.&nbsp; it was awful.&nbsp; i didn't call on anyone.&nbsp; i managed to muster up some desire to reclaim my life and fight back, which was nice because for awhile now i've given up that.&nbsp; sunday i knew i had to make it to church or i was screwed, and it took everything i had to get there.&nbsp; but i did, got a good word, it was good.

       well i think i have definitely sunk into a nice depression as of late :(&nbsp;don't worry i am already starting up therapy again.&nbsp; it's a new thing tonight, not sure how it's going to work out, but it's gotta be better than what i'm going through otherwise.&nbsp; work sucks, i feel like i'm dragging everybody down, so i almost didn't even want to talk to nick today because.. i guess i wanted to hide from him, i don't know,&nbsp;don't wanna delve into that :P&nbsp; but i did talk to him, and in the course of talking to him basically had it pressed in my heart all the encouraging&nbsp;things he's&nbsp;ever said.&nbsp; and lately that's been a lot, because lately i've been down a lot.&nbsp; so i compiled a little list and read through all those, and..&nbsp;*sigh* i like him so much :)

       this weekend was the&nbsp;most intense&nbsp;i've had in a looong time, oh my lord!&nbsp; ok first off i have good days and bad days, days where i'm convinced that&nbsp;i'm recovered and completely healed anew... and then there are days where i think who am i kidding, i've made no progress whatsoever, still the same.&nbsp; saturday was one of those days and it was evident to me that no changes&nbsp;have been made.&nbsp; and sunday, oh my god!, sunday sucked big time.&nbsp; i was&nbsp;convinced 'the others' were back and that this whole time i&nbsp;have been another personality and that's why things have only been temporal and not permanent.&nbsp; i mean sunday night i was&nbsp;stricken thinking&nbsp;i&nbsp;never even got saved.&nbsp; so.&nbsp; i'm trying to figure out how to work all that out.&nbsp; i either need to get on some meds and stop the bad days where i think i haven't changed, or if it's in fact true i haven't changed, then i need to.&nbsp; because i want to be at the place where i think i'm recovered and healed anew, but only if it's legitimate, right now it feels like it's all been a big sham and pretending :(&nbsp;&nbsp; i liked it a lot better when i was able to switch personalities, these days the ups and downs and everything that's wrong is painfully apparent.

       see, here's the thing...    i wrote nick an email oh about a month ago... *checks email*... 6/25 to be exact.&nbsp; it was a friday, and the thing was we had been edging into some stuff i didn't really want to get into, and i threw myself out there in a vulnerable (for me) way and told him i didn't want to&nbsp;continue and touched on some reasons why not.&nbsp; now to me, the things that i said would definitely either drive someone further or closer, but not indifferent..&nbsp; so i emailed him late one night, had butterflies even sending the darn thing, and then i went to sleep.&nbsp; i didn't think he'd write me back that night, but the next morning i checked it 'just in case'.&nbsp; and then i figured after lunch i'd check it again, thinking he'd have gotten it when he woke up.&nbsp; no answer.&nbsp; so i thought ok, maybe around dinner time i'll check it again.&nbsp; and so on and so on.&nbsp; i swear i checked that gosh darn thing about 15 times that weekend, each time anxiously waiting to see if i had new mail from him, and each time i think i went one inch more towards the&nbsp;crazy side.&nbsp; anywho, needless to say he never gave me the courtesy of a response, and when i talked to him monday i asked (as nonchalantly as i could) if he'd gotten it.&nbsp; yup but he didn't get a chance to reply yet.&nbsp; and apparently over the last month he still hasn't found time to reply yet.&nbsp; he says he's trying to form the words, say things right, that's the way he is, but SHIT!!!!!!!!
