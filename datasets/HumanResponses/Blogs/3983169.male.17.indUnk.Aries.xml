        I have come to the conclusion that computers are purely evil and are really just a plot to destroy us all.  I also came to the conclusion that meijers is evil so i quit today.  After 15 months of my teenage life gone for 5.75 an hour, i finally decided to leave today.

         i woke up early today and went over cortneys house for a few because she was feeling sick.&nbsp; we weren't &nbsp;suppost to see each other today but we did.&nbsp; Then i cooked her some breakfast which i dont think she liked too much because i burnt the toast, and then cleaned up the kitchen and whatnot for her.&nbsp; I really love cortney alot.&nbsp; yesterday we said we should go 1 day without seeing each other.&nbsp; then last night, just thinking about not seeing her for a whole day made me miss her.&nbsp; i wrote a bunch of songs too.&nbsp;

         yeah, my mom and i got into a fight last night. i was at cortneys and we were talking and then my mom calls and yells at me to come home right now. two minutes later she comes pulling up making a scene. i am 17, i think i can handle being out at 11:30 during the summer. so yeah, i came home and momma and i were arguing at the back door and mike comes in. at that moment i told her i was staying at his house and i left. i woke up this morning to find my car gone with a bunch of voicemails from my dad telling me he took my car and the lisence plate. so i ended up skating over to cortneys house in the morning, i only got 4 hours of sleep. i was really tired today and really grouchy..kind of. my brother set up a meeting with sharon(the manager at meijer) and me today. so i think im gonna end up working there again. which isnt that bad, cause i really need money. im always broke and have no money. and i feel bad cause i should take cortney out because she deserves to be taken out and have a good time. so thatll begin very shortly. im super tired and im not going to get sleep again, but thats why god made coffee right? and mountain dew.    today, i love cortney more than she'll ever know. tomaorw, it'll only be more. everyday will be like this.  i still hate meijers.

         today was super.  i went out to lunch with cortney and her momma.  we went to red robin and i have never been there before, iv only been to coney islands.  it was quite fun then we went shopping.  yay.  after that i took cortney to mjr to see if she still had a job.  while she was tehre i filled out another application to work there...being unemployed is fun and all, but money is needed.  so im starting to look harder for jobs now.  after that we hung out for a bit and then made a fire in her backyard and went swimming while it was getting dark out.

         today was a pretty interesting day. went to the mall with cortney and stole a 10 cent hair clip from the china place. then i took 2 'i am loved' pins. i am a total thief. someone cut off my hands....then after that we got to babysit. i went swimming in really cold water with white boxers on......ahhhhh. then i taught the kid, ricky, how to dance like a complete fool. and i was succesful. then i left to go get some 8 gauge plug things and bought a shrek toy thing for ricky.

      we're doing good at the "tell cortney that tom loves her" plan.  so far, there was 6 people...and i know who you are friends...so dont let me forget to get you your nickel.   BUT......   I think we can do better.  Tell everyone to do this.  even if they dont know cortney.  together...we can do it.

      if anybody sees cortney..tell her that I love her.   im me and get her screen name from me so you can tell her that.  i will give everyone a nickel if they do it.    heres what you say..   "Hello Cortney.  Tom wanted me to tell you that he loves you.  Bye."   you can even copy and paste it from here if its too hard to type.  heres me (abandonedpools3 or taft tastic)  im me and be a nickel richer.
