      It's Memorial Day and I wanted to thank the armed forces of the United States, particularly the members of my family who have or are serving in the armed forces.  My maternal Grandfather, Conley, served in World War II. He's no longer with us but I'm sure he would like the newly dedicated memorial in Washington.   My Father and two of his brothers, Steve and Carl, are Vietnam Veterans. Carl was a career Army man, spending nearly 25 years in the service. Last month Carl buried his wife, his faithful companion through all the years in the service and time in foreign countries.   My cousin Lee was in the Navy and another cousin, Jeremy, suffered an injury during Army training that left him ineligible for duty. Neither saw combat action but that doesn't diminish their commitment or their courage. They were willing to die for my freedom if necessary and I appreciate it.  My cousin Robert, who incidentally is Lee's brother, is currently in the Army. He's stationed in Colorado and facing a year in Iraq. He celebrated his 21st birthday last week and is the youngest of 26 grandchildren. Robert spent two years in college before joining the Army, a lifelong dream. He plans to return to college and become a history teacher when he leaves the Army.   Happy Memorial Day!

      I posted the big news yesterday. Novel 2's first draft is finished so I have shifted my attention to edits and rewrites for Novel 1.    Yesterday I read through most of Novel 1 and made notes about things I need to fix. The biggest surprise to me was how much I disliked my own work. The plot needs to be strengthened and the characters need more depth. Devon over at  urlLink Ink In My Coffee  posted earlier this week (May 23rd to be exact) that some of her older stories need to be "retired" but they were good exercises. I'm trying to think of Novel 1 in it's current state as an exercise. With a few changes this can be a good story but it's not at the moment. I'm glad I let it sit so long. I can be more objective now.   My goal is to finish the first rewrite by July 2nd.

      I know it's not Friday and this isn't a Writing Progress Report post but I'm excited. I finished the first draft of Novel 2 last night. The final count is 456 pages and 120,930 words. I'll probably cut some things when I edit of course but that's not a bad thing. Novel 2 is better work than Novel 1 (and no I haven't come up with titles yet). Before I went to bed last night I made a back up of all my writing projects and put it away. Now I'm turning my attention to edits and rewrites for Novel 1.

      This week is full of special days and big events. Sunday my husband and I celebrated our 6th anniversary. We had a wonderful afternoon together. Our car has been messed up for more than five weeks now so we weren't able to go out but we did arrange for the girls to visit with a family friend so we could have a private celebration.   Yesterday my sister and her husband celebrated their 2nd anniversary. Congratulations to them. A few months ago they were having serious marital problems and now things seem to be fine. My sister dragged me into the problems when she lied about spending the day with me. Things settled down between them when my sister found out she's pregnant. Unfortunately the issues were never discussed. I know they'll have problems again because they didn't work through them. I just hope they leave me out of it next time.  Today my five year old had Kindergarten Registration. She was excited to finally see her school and meet some other kids. Kindergarten classes stagger start the students so my daughter's first day of school will fall between August 3rd and August 5th with the full class present for the first time on August 6th. One third of the students will attend class each of the first three days. In July we'll get a letter telling us who our daughter's teacher is and what day she starts school. The letter will also have dates and times for Parent Orientation and Kindergarten Drop In.   Today is also my cousin's birthday. Happy Birthday to Pfc Robert H.! He finished basic training in March and is currently stationed in Colorado. The last letter I received from him says he expects to spend a year in Iraq.  Saturday my youngest daughter turns two! My parents and siblings will be joining us for hamburgers, hotdogs, home made ice cream and cake on Sunday evening. My husband's family never attends parties or holiday gatherings though I always extend the invitation. I'm sure if I didn't tell them about the party they would be offended so I make the obligatory phone call each time, "We're having (whatever, whenever, where ever) and we'd love for you to join us." My Mother in-law has told me I make too much of a fuss over birthdays. She believes a birthday is just another day and the MOST you should do to celebrate is give somebody a card and a cupcake. Obviously we disagree.  After this week things settle down again for the rest of the summer with only Father's Day and the second daughter's 3rd birthday left to celebrate.

      My daily writing sessions netted 17 additional pages on novel 2 but most importantly the heroine made some choices that are helping move the story along to the final chapter. I had the last few chapters planned out in my mind but those plans have been scrapped. My characters are clamoring for a different ending, insisting it's their story. I'm still optimistic about finishing the first draft by the end of the month.  Novel 1's edit and rewrite is nagging me. Every time I go to my desk I see the folder with the first draft printed out. It seems to scream, "I'm still waiting!"   I've been toying with the idea of writing a book about my life but I'm still uncertain. It's the type of work that would alienate my family and cause hurt feelings. That's a major issue and the reason the idea has been kept on a shelf. It's possible I'll make a few changes and write it as fiction.

      George Strait is one of my favorite country artist and today is his birthday. He's the most certified country artist of all time with 30 platinum albums. He's had over 50 #1 hits and is commonly referred to as "The King of Country Music". His website georgestrait.com says "George Strait first hit the charts when 'Unwound' took the #6 position in 1981. His first #1 was 'Fool Hearted Memory' in 1982 and between 1986 and 1989 each of the 11 singles he released hit the #1 spot." In December 2002 he scored his 50th #1 hit breaking Conway Twitty's long-standing record of 49.

       urlLink The New York Times > Science > Space & Cosmos > Venus Returns for Its Shining Hour   Excerpts from the article by Warren E. Leary (May 18, 2004)  On June 8, people in the right places on Earth will be able to see Venus move across the face of the Sun in a kind of minieclipse that is visible twice every century or so. The last such occurrence, called a transit of Venus, was in 1882.  Although transits of Venus have occurred for thousands of years, the first report of its subtle crossing of the Sun was in 1639. The transits occur when the orbits of Venus, Earth and the Sun put them into alignment along the same plane.  Since 1639, transits have occurred in 1761, 1769, 1874 and 1882. If someone misses the one next month, there will be another opportunity on June 6, 2012. After that, more than a century will pass before the next transits, in 2117 and 2125.  *******************  The article says people on the East Coast might get a glimpse at sunrise but by the time the sun is visible above the trees around my house the transit will be over. I guess that's one negative aspect of living in the woods the way I do.

      Recently I told one of my online friends I hope to find a literary agent by the time I turn 30. The next message I got through the instant message program said, "How old ARE you? I thought you were at least 34!" I told her I'm 27 and we discussed why she thought I was older. She told me my attitude makes me seem older, more mature. She and I have never met in real life and she has never seen my picture so she based the age on the conversations we have had. Thanks for the compliment friend!

      I pushed past 100,000 words on Novel 2's first draft this week. I should be able to wrap that first draft up by the end of the month. Novel 2 is the WIP I used for the writing life challenge I did in March but I started the writing at the end of February. 100k words in 3 months is nice progress.   Novel 1 is patiently waiting for edits and rewrites. I hope to have the edits and rewrites finished by October. I plan to participate in NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) in November and have already selected one of the ideas from my file and made notes about research I need to do before November 1st.   A few ideas came to me this week and like always I wrote them down and added them to my file. I don't try to decide if they are "good ideas" or not. I just write them down and file them.   My goal for next week is to continue as I have been, writing at least an hour each day.

      Today I asked my five year old daughter to name a hero. She named a boy we know and when I asked what makes him a hero she said, "He saved me from the ants." My daughter screams if she sees an ant. I'm not sure where the fear came from but it's a very real thing for her. I've seen her in "ant panic" before; arms flailing, feet kicking, and screaming "get it!" The boy she named stomped some ants one night over a year ago while the kids were all gathered at my sister's house. She hasn't forgotten and she hasn't let anybody else forget either. I asked if she knew any other heroes and she tapped her finger to her cheek, "Hmmm." Eventually she said, "Daddy 'cause he's really strong and he brings me skittles and you 'cause you're smart and you take care of me and my sisters." I've never really thought of myself as a hero before. Heroes are people who work to make the world a better place or who put themselves in danger for others. Soldiers, law enforcement personnel, fire fighters, teachers, coaches, doctors, and nurses are all heroes. I'm not a hero. I'm just a person; a mother, a wife, a daughter, a sister, a cousin, a neighbor, a granddaughter, a niece, an aunt and a friend. I'm just Angela.   Since my daughter proclaimed me a hero I've been thinking about other "ordinary people" who are really heroes. Single parents, women who leave abusive situations and make new lives for themselves, volunteers, blood and organ donors are all heroes. People who open their homes and hearts to foster children or who adopt children are heroes. People who work hard in school and stay out of trouble while they are young so they can have a better life, they're heroes. People who are pursuing a dream are heroes. Anybody who makes a difference in another person's life is a hero. When I stopped to really think about it I realized heroes are everywhere.

      Why is it when a person tries to make positive changes in their life they encounter resistance and criticism at every turn? I've been trying to put me first more often and I'm being called selfish or worse for my trouble. It's not like I don't do anything for other people. The opposite in fact. Until about six months ago I was doing too much for others and not taking care of myself. My hobbies, my needs, my desires were all pushed to the side to clear the way for the needs and wants of others. I never seemed to have time to myself. I was obviously such a push over it never occurred to my husband or in-laws I might have a problem with my Father in-law moving in for five months. I didn't have a problem when I was told "a few days" but unless I'm not as good at math as I originally thought five months is much longer than a few days. Those five months were difficult for me personally and caused many problems in my marriage. I held on to my patience and my temper with an iron grip and even restrained myself from shouting my joy to the world when my Father in-law finally went back home. When my Father in-law left I realized I needed to make some changes for myself. It wasn't uncommon for six months to pass without me spending any time alone. I'm not talking about being the only person awake in the house. That doesn't count because I had to be careful not to wake the others. I rarely got to eat a meal without interruption and even bathroom trips were not private. It seemed every time I decided to relax by soaking in a bubble bath the entire household ended up in the bathroom talking to me or retrieving things they needed. Locking the door worked to a point but then I was treated to a door pounding "Mommy, I need to potty" serenade and a puddle to clean up when I got out of the tub. Once or twice I lost my patience and my temper and ended up screaming that whoever walked through that door next would get a face full of water. When that happened I was always greeted with "What's your problem anyway?" No problem I just wanted some privacy.   I made a New Year's Resolution to take better care of myself - physically, mentally, etc. I gradually changed my diet, replacing junk with fruits and vegetables then I squeezed in some exercise three days a week. I even bought a book of baseball tickets. The idea was to go ahead and pay for them so I would actually go to the games when baseball season started. If I waited to pay at the gate I didn't think I would actually make it to a game. I like baseball though I don't follow it as closely as others. I hadn't been to a single game since I got married because there always seemed to be something more important to do. I'm happy to report I have been to one game so far this season. My husband doesn't like any sports so I talked my brother into going to games with me. I got rid of 11 boxes and 5 bags of clutter. In March I participated in a Writing Life Marathon Challenge. I wanted to get back to my writing and the challenge helped me focus on finding pockets of time in my day that I could use to write. The challenge goal was 50,000 words between March 1st and March 31st. I wrote 63,230 and learned how to make time for things I cared about. All through that challenge I was making little changes. I claimed a corner for myself and moved my desk and filing cabinet there. I picked a corner in a room that isn't frequently used in the hopes I could use it to escape occasionally. I unsubscribed from email newsletters I never read, cleaned up my favorites list and deleted/blocked some toxic people from my instant message buddy lists. I stopped answering the phone every time it rang too. All those small things have really made a big difference and although I'm not finished changing things I'm already happier.  Unfortunately those changes invited criticism and rebukes from people close to me and people who know nothing about me. When I bought the baseball tickets I was scolded for wasting money. I considered that $50 an investment in me and was pleased with the deal I got. Paying at the gate 16 times would cost at least $96. I was told that money would have been put to better use buying things for my children. My children have closets and drawers full of clothes and more toys than they need. They are fed three meals and two snacks a day. I know this because I feed them. I tried to brush the criticism aside but it made me wonder if I was overlooking a more immediate need. I hated second guessing myself like that. I had just recovered from that minor incident when my Granny felt the need to attack me verbally.   She brought up the 14 months my Mother was homeless and told me I should go straight to hell for not honoring my Mother. She wanted to know what kind of person I was to let my Mother live in a metal storage shed that long. Then she told me I have been selected as the caretaker for my oldest brother should anything ever happen to my Mother. He's lazy. He could do more  than he does but my Mother enables him. I was told I need lessons in compassion and humility and the best way for that to happen would be for me to allow someone I thought was beneath me to move in with me. I have two older brothers. The oldest one I can tolerate in very small doses. The other brother is one of my closest friends. He writes poetry and shares it with me and he's the one I talked in to going to baseball games with me. Granny told me the younger brother won't be responsible for the oldest one because they would fight too much. I have a younger sister too. She wasn't selected as the caretaker because "her life doesn't need to be disrupted." As a final insult my Granny told me it was common knowledge I will be taking care of my Father if he should ever need it. Common knowledge to everybody but me. I was angry with my Granny and my Mother for planning my future for me. I was furious with my Granny for knocking down a door I didn't want opened. My Mother's 14 months in that storage building were painful for me. I spent many nights crying as the wind howled outside my windows and every day I dealt with the knowledge that I could change her situation with four words "You can stay here". It would have been easy to say those four words to her but it would have disastrous. My oldest brother was living with her and any invitation extended to my Mother was assumed to include him. I couldn't let him stay here. I had children to protect. He's a convicted pedophile so I never told my Mother she could stay with me. My friends sympathized with me and understood why I chose to let my Mother stay in that situation. My Granny told me I shouldn't judge my brother and that there is such a thing as being convicted of crimes you didn't commit. I didn't bother to tell her I think my brother really did it. She wouldn't have appreciated that. I know the victims. I know the details of the case. All 4 victims gave the same story in separate interviews without specific prompts from investigators. On top of that he plead guilty. I know I could have ended the conversation with my Granny at any time by hanging up the phone but I wanted to get it over with. Hanging up on her wouldn't have stopped her, it would have only postponed the conversation. When she was finished chewing me up and spitting me out she told me she had been wondering what kind of person I was and she didn't like the answer. I called the brother I'm close to and talked to him for a long time after my Granny finally hung up the phone. Talking to my brother helped but I still felt raw and wounded for a week afterwards.   During the Writing Challenge I participated in I read some negative comments about me. In the last week or so it became obvious few people on the board were going to meet the 50,000 goal. In reality I was the only person who did but others hit personal goals and it wasn't a contest anyway. I was lurking on another board when I stumbled across a post saying only one person was going to make it and that was because everybody else was busy with "real jobs" or freelance work. I was furious at first. This woman had some nerve posting that. I may not get paid for taking care of my three kids 24/7 but it sure as hell is a job and I resent that opinion. I've had to deal with variations of the "you don't get paid, it's not a real job" thinking over the past three years. When I did the challenge I wrote two or three hours a day, usually after the girls were asleep or when they were happily playing. I was never out of sight or hearing and I certainly didn't neglect them. Reading that post took some of the joy out of my accomplishment for a little while until I decide to assume she was just jealous.   My sister has called me selfish for refusing to babysit when it's inconvenient for me and for agreeing to keep her kid if she'll keep mine for the same length of time later so I can have a break. She wouldn't drop everything to keep my kids for me but she expects me to drop everything to keep her kid for her. It's what she's used to and she's making it clear she doesn't like the new rules. Hopefully she'll learn to follow the new rules soon. In the meantime I'm hearing "selfish" or "bitch" in the same sentence with my name more often than any other time in my life. It's actually funny sometimes.

      Several people have told me through email and instant message conversations that they are jealous or don’t see how I have time to do something for myself, specifically write. I decided to address that here in my blog. First, I want to repeat what I always tell them. I don’t have time; I make time.  I developed a cleaning routine that keeps my house tidy without using all my time. I’ve been told my cleaning routine is similar to fly lady or something else. I don’t know much about that; I just know this works for me. I focus on one room each day Monday through Saturday. Monday I clean the kitchen, complete with wiping out the microwave, oven, refrigerator and mopping the floor. Tuesday I dust, straighten, and vacuum in the living room and Wednesday I clean a bathroom. Thursday I clean the room the girls use; sorting toys and putting them in the appropriate place, dusting, vacuuming. Friday I focus on my own room and bathroom together and Saturday I focus on the last room, specifically my desk area. The daily room takes approximately an hour. I wash one load of laundry each day, usually putting it in the washer the night before and turning it on first thing in the morning. By the time breakfast is over the laundry is ready to be hung out or tossed in the dryer. If I hang the laundry out to dry I fold it as I get it off the line in the evening while the girls play outside. If I use the dryer, I fold and put away the laundry while the girls play in the bathtub before bed. As soon as the girls are in bed I wash all the dishes from the day, by hand because we don’t have a dish washer. I let the dishes sit in the dish drainer while I spend five minutes in each room picking things up and putting them away then I put the dishes away. By this time my husband is home so I spend time talking to him about his day. When he sits down at his computer to play video games, I put on my headphones, turn on Gary Allan and write. During the day my computer is always on and my current WIP is open. I work on it every chance I get and that’s not often.  I have a “Mommy’s Time Out” every afternoon which is really just a time my children are expected to be quiet while I make phone calls, pay bills and eat lunch. I’ve tried eating with my children but that doesn’t work well. No matter how much I do before sitting them down for lunch, somebody always needs something and my food ends up getting cold, etc.  Ideally the girls would take a nap after lunch but they rarely do so I instituted “Mommy’s Time Out.” I write when there aren’t other things demanding my attention during that hour. Once a week I use part of my time out to make a menu for the week. It’s amazing how much time I used to spend each day just staring in to the cabinets and refrigerator trying to figure out what to cook.   Little things really do add up. For example, I never watch television and a friend who complains about not having time admits she watches three different shows every week. That’s an hour and a half she’s using for television and I’m using for writing. I used to get at least two hours of uninterrupted writing time each week but that hasn’t happened in several months now. My husband used to go bowling either Friday night or Saturday night with some friends. I chose to wait up for him and write while he was gone.  If I worked outside of the home rather than staying here with my children I would probably still have the same amount of time to write. I would take a notebook with me everywhere and write when I could. I would probably still have twenty minutes to spend writing during lunch and snatches of time throughout the day plus some time after the girls went to bed at night and time on the weekends. It all comes down to how you choose to spend your time. Me, I’d rather read, write and edit than watch television. I’d rather spend less than two hours a day cleaning and maintaining order in my house than give up all that time at once.

      I'm making progress with the edits but I don't think the first rewrite will be finished by next week. My productivity has suffered because I've been easily distracted the past two weeks. Months ago I moved my desk to a corner in a room we rarely used so I would have a place to call my own. The plan was for me to use that space when my husband was home but it's not working out that way. My desk area is cluttered so badly I haven't used it in over a month. There are four computer towers in the floor blocking access to the desk. Stacks of discs, screws, wires and other computer paraphernalia litter every surface. I'm afraid to touch anything. I use a laptop but "my space" is equipped with a keyboard, mouse and a monitor that has seen better days. In the words of my husband, "It's easier to use this old monitor than to keep unhooking mine when I need to work on somebody else's computer." I understand that and I know it's hard to work on anything when three little girls are trying to help but I'm not thrilled my space has been taken over, again.  This week I read  Silent Storm  by Amanda Stevens. It's a Harlequin Intrigue, romantic suspense about a psychokinetic killer, a cop and a super soldier. Interesting concept but not a book I would recommend.

      Yesterday was Father’s Day and I spent some time thinking about the things I learned from my Father and our relationship. When I was ten I was confident my Father loved me. When I was eleven I was confident he didn’t. Today I don’t know how he truly feels and I rarely give the matter a second thought. No doubt what happened with my Father changed my life but I like the way things turned out.  When my Father left I went through the normal phase of blaming myself and wondering if he would have stayed had I been a better daughter. My Mother kept saying it wasn’t our fault and I tried to believe her. I had just started thinking she might be right when my Father visited for the first time in six months. I don’t remember how the conversation got started but I don’t think I’ll ever forget my Father’s words, “You will never amount to anything. I don’t love you. I never have and I never will. You’re the biggest mistake of my life and I wish you had never been born.”  I cried myself to sleep for weeks after that, certain he would have stayed with my Mother if I had never been born. I thought about killing myself but every time I thought about it my Grandma would say or do something and I would start thinking about how sad she would be if I was gone.  My Father’s selfish actions hurt his wife and his children. I didn’t want to be like him. Eventually anger gave way to acceptance. It was no longer a shock when my Father didn’t have time to come by and look at the leaky roof or to show up at a school or church play. I started concentrating on what I had; my Grandma loved me completely and I had a wonderful relationship with God and a church full of support and love. I learned the power of small acts of love from people all around me after my Father left. I like to think I am a person of compassion and empathy.  One time my cousin told me, “I saw your Dad at the hardware store and he was talking to an old friend of his. I heard him say he has two sons and one daughter, a pretty red-haired blue-eyed girl.”  I’m not the red-haired blue-eyed beauty; that’s why my cousin told me about the conversation. I was heart-broken when I showed up for church that night and my feelings must have been obvious because people were showering me with love. During adult choir practice a friend and I were talking about the move to high school the next year. She asked if I was taking college prep classes and I told her no. If I had realized how much her next words would impact my life I would have thanked her right then and there. She told me, “You’re one of the smartest people I know. You shouldn’t believe your Father; you should prove him wrong.” We talked more and she told me what the college prep classes involved and encouraged me to sign up for advanced English rather than general English when I selected the courses I would take as a freshmen in high school. I followed her advice and soon I was fighting with my Mother about college. My Mother thought college was pointless and didn’t want me to go but I won that battle. I have my Father and my friend Tara to thank for the four wonderful years I spent at college. Tara was the first person to ever mention college to me, the first person to believe I could go and do well. Tara was the only person who ever dared say, “Prove him wrong.” She gave me a goal and my determination to prove my Father wrong kept me on track until I started doing well in school for myself. I can’t say for sure when things changed from “I want to prove him wrong” to “I’m doing this for me” but I know the change happened before I graduated high school. It’s hard to say what might have happened if my Father had never walked out on his family but I honestly don’t think college would have been part of my future. My Father didn’t set out to teach me the power of compassion and empathy or how important goals and dreams are but I learned those lessons because of him.  I started writing because of my Father too. I wrote down all the hurtful things he said to me and what I thought of him. Writing helped me heal because I could be completely honest about my feelings on paper. I eventually destroyed those written rants because they had served their purpose.

      I hoped to be finished with edits and rewrites for the first ten chapters by today but I'm still working on chapter 7. Concentrating on my work proved to be a challenge this week, especially on the four days my children decided to skip their nap. I could say it's their fault I didn't accomplish as much as I hoped but that would be unfair and untrue.  This week I'm reading  The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People  by Stephen R. Covey (nonfiction) and  Frederick's Fables  by Leo Lionni (children's fiction).

      I’m drifting away from some people who used to be important in my life. I cherish my memories of the time we spent together during our college years. Sometimes when I think of these people I smile and sometimes I sigh. I have never intentionally let a relationship slowly fizzle so I’m sorry it’s happening.   I’ve wondered if I could do anything different or anything more to keep these people as friends. I’ve asked myself have I given them my all and I know I have.  I’ve given them the benefit of the doubt every time they’ve failed to respond to an email in the past few years. I’ve told myself how busy they are and ignored that little voice in my head that shouted, “You’re busy too and you had time to say hello to them!”  It’s true. I don’t work outside of my home the way my friends do but I used to and I kept in touch then. I’m at home all the time now but I have less time than I did when I left for work every day. I’ve tried to tell myself they just aren’t good at keeping in touch but even as I said it I knew it was a lie. They kept in touch with childhood friends all through their college years; writing letters, sending emails, making phone calls. I guess it didn’t take them as long to realize we aren’t really friends any more. I’m sad we’ve grown so far apart but it’s freeing at the same time. I can concentrate on the friends I have left and not worry so much about the relationships that have grown distant. Relationships are too hard for one person to carry the burden alone. Unnourished love dies.   I sometimes get forwards about friendship from these people. The kind of emails that say, “I thought of you today,” or “You’re special to me.”  Maybe I’m a cynic but I keep thinking how easy it is to click forward to address book and when I see all those email addresses on the email I’m almost certain that’s what happened. I’m not saying the person should send that email to each person individually, just that I have a hard time believing they actually thought of me when they mass forwarded it. I rarely send forwards for that same reason. Forwards are impersonal. I am guilty of mass-mailing my friends so I don’t have to type the same stuff over and over again but those emails don’t go to everybody in my address book. I select the recipients consciously, leaving out people I’ve already talked to via phone or instant messages so they don’t get “old news” and most of the time all the recipients know each other. Since forwards don’t count as real communications, in my opinion, I haven’t really heard from these people but once or twice in two years. Obviously we’ve drifted. Maybe one day we’ll drift back in to each other’s lives; no matter what I wish them well.

      Novel 1's edits are going well. The three chapters I have rewritten and the new one I added are major improvements to the story. I try to devote an hour each day to my writing but this week that didn't happen. I worked on the story every day but at least two days were half hour sessions. Overall, I'm pleased with the way things are going.

      “Stick to the fight when you’re hardest hit, it’s when things seem worst that you mustn’t quit.”  That’s one of my favorite quotes, unfortunately I’m not sure who to credit. It’s been going through my mind the past few days, bringing up some memories. The first time I came across that quote was in December 1992. Hard to believe it’s been 11 years since that dreadful day but I’m grateful for the passing time. I was a junior in high school that year and life was moving along the same as always until the day the news crew was waiting in my driveway when I got off the bus. The rooster squawked a greeting, alerting the men hanging around outside the van to our presence.  My brothers and I got off the bus at our Grandma’s house and walked through our aunt’s yard to our house. Our driveway was in a blind curve so bus drivers didn’t feel comfortable stopping there. On this particular day my oldest brother decided to walk along the edge of the road and get the mail while my other brother and I took our usual route. When we crested the small hill between our Aunt’s house and our own the rooster squawked and the men starting asking for my oldest brother. I don’t remember what either of those men looked like but I’ll never forget having that camera shoved in my face. They filmed my oldest brother walking from the mailbox to the house and up the back steps. They shouted questions at him but he didn’t stop to talk to them.   That night I watched and listened in horror as they played the footage of my brother and talked about the charges of child molestation. The mom of two of his victims had called the station and told them all about my brother being an accused child molester. She called attention to the fact that he was attending public school, still at the age of 20. They showed a clip of the high school my brothers and I attended and questioned the safety of other students on campus. The next morning when I got up to start my day I flipped the page of my perpetual calendar and read the words “Stick to the fight when you’re hardest hit, it’s when things seem worst that you mustn’t quit.”  I repeated those words throughout my day at school as people asked me questions about my brother. Most of the students in my classes had not realized he was my brother until they arrived on campus that morning and heard the rumors. Kids can be cruel, unbelievably cruel. Some of the students I encountered that day were kind, “How are you holding up?” A few simply wrapped their arms around me and told me they were praying for me and everything would work out.  A few guys wanted to know if I was in to freaky things like my brother and there questions about whether my brothers and I engaged in sex acts together. I was proud of myself for making it through that day without bursting in to tears or giving in to the temptation to punch somebody.    The principal summoned me to his office to assure me anybody I reported for teasing me about my brother would be disciplined. One of the first things he said to me was, “Until your mother called this morning I had no idea he was your brother. I’m still trying to wrap my mind around that one.”  I assured him I would report any problems knowing all along I wouldn’t turn anybody in. Teachers were talking about the news story and within an hour of my Mother’s phone call a memo went out informing teachers the student in the news had two siblings in the school. My oldest brother was in special education classes so he spent most of his day in the units outside the main building. My other brother and I were part of the general population in the main building. I was in college preparatory classes and my brother was in the “just get me out of this place” classes. Although not twins we were both juniors and everybody knew we were related.  One of my classes was family life and we frequently discussed current events and news. When I walked in the room my teacher looked worried. I was expecting a discussion, people had been talking about it all day so I took a few deep breaths before I took my seat. As soon as attendance was taken the girl sitting at the two person table with me opened the discussion. After a few minutes she said, “I wouldn’t want to be anywhere near any of his family. I bet they’re all freaks like he is.” I was speechless. A boy in my family life class had always known about the connection between me and my oldest brother so he asked the girl who was sharing my table to trade seats with him. The girl refused the offer to trade seats saying, “I like Angela. She’s one of the sweetest people I’ve ever met.” The guy laughed, “Yeah but she might be a freak like her brother; you wouldn’t want to be near her.” My teacher hissed at the guy but I was actually glad to have the relationship out in the open after the class discussion. The girl ended up trading seats with that guy while I was out of the room on a dumb errand my teacher dreamed up to get me out of there. When I came back the class was completely silent and I felt awkward and uncomfortable as I returned to my seat. My new table mate broke the silence, calling me by my oldest brother’s name. Half the students laughed, half were appalled and he used the noise they were making as a cover to say, “I just couldn’t sit there and listen to that another minute, knowing he’s your brother.  You probably hate me right now but maybe you’ll laugh about this one day.” I’ve laughed about it several times over the years but at the time the only thing I could think was, “Stick to the fight when you’re hardest hit, it’s when things seem worst that you mustn’t quit.”

      I'm really struggling with the edits. I sat down to work this evening and my mind went totally blank. I pulled out my handwritten notes and read them while a voice in my head screamed, "That's not how it should be! Not right! Not right!" After several horrible sentences I left the computer and spent some time playing with my daughters. Hours later I sat down at the computer, opened my file again and read through the changes I have already made. The writing is good but still there's an overwhelming sense of wrongness I can't ignore. Maybe a few hours sleep will give me a better perspective. . .    12 HOURS LATER  I slept, not peacefully but I slept. When I sat down to work this morning things fell in to place. I mentioned the voice in my head to my husband and he asked if I was sick or if he should find a good therapist for me. He doesn't get it when I tell him the characters give me the story but he doesn't really think I'm crazy either.  As a rule I don't share specific details about my writing with people. I leave out one of the most important details of my life when I talk to many of my friends and family members. In fact the majority of my large extended family doesn't know I write at all. I do post on two writing boards and I have mentioned my writing on other boards I use but only in general terms. When I need to talk about specific details my husband is always there to listen and so are my friends Andy and Charlotte. Thank you for being there when I need you. I hope I don't let you down when you need me.

      Editing is slow work. I didn't like much about chapter one so I rewrote the entire chapter. I have a handwritten list of things I want to add to the story so I have a "map" for the work. I babbled about the story in a message to someone last night which helped get me back on track after my sister's insults earlier in the day.

      Today my sister called me to ask me to call our niece's mother. I didn't want to make yet another phone call for her and I had other things to do. Remind me not to mention my writing to the little darling in the future. Here's how our conversation went  Angela: "I'm busy but I'll give you her number and you can call her."  Sister: "What are you doing?"  Angela: "Keeping up with the kids mostly."  Sister: "Mostly? What else are you doing?"  Angela: "Editing, Surfing the Net"  Sister: "You have too much time on your hands, you know that."  Angela: "Not really. I don't have a social life. You know I haven't been to the movies in over two years now."  Sister: "You don't need to go to the movies. You're always living in your head writing stupid stories nobody will want to read."  Angela: "Thanks for the vote of confidence"   Sister: "I don't know why you think you'll get anything published."  Angela: "Me either. You want to read it and tell me what's wrong with it?" (She has never read any of my work and if I mention my writing she changes the subject so I stopped mentioning it to her except for the slip today)  Sister: "I don't have time for that nonsense."  Angela: "Well I don't have time to make phone calls for you. Here's that number you wanted."  She hung up in a huff and tonight when she picked her son up she barely said two words to me. She acted like she was the one who had been insulted. I'm not always available like I was a few months ago and she's having a hard time accepting the new rules.

      I'm sitting here trying to edit a steamy scene when I get an IM from some guy who introduces himself as Bill tells me where he's from and how old he is then asks for my age and location. I talked to him for a few minutes and he says he's married looking for a discreet relationship. Can we say TACKY?! Anyway, I told the guy "that wouldn't be me. I'm a very happily married mommy of three" and wished him well. When I went back to my word document I had typed part of my conversation with Bill in the middle of the steamy scene I was working on. It's not G-rated so I'm not posting it but needless to say it was hilarious to be reading a scene like that and come across "oh so did you go to Speed Street?". I've never done that before, never even typed in the lyrics of a song I'm listening to. To make matters worse I meant to post this here on my blog and ended up posting it on a message board I use frequently. Can I blame it on the four kids I've been chasing all day? I have my 14 month old nephew in addition to my three girls.

      Sunday at my daughter's birthday party my brother growled at me, "Why are you watching me? You always stare at me when I'm here." I shrugged and his girlfriend muttered an obscenity under her breath. My sister took over "brother watch" duties for a few minutes and my brother snarled at her, "You afraid I'm going to push your kid down?" My sister and I are very different people. I would have ignored him, she gave him the fight he was looking for. "Maybe," she snapped. My brother was furious. "You and Angela are always watching me when I'm around." Hey big brother here's a clue for you: You're a child molester at a kid's birthday party. You aren't leaving my sight.   Truth be told I'd rather not invite my oldest brother to my daughters' birthday parties but I do it to keep the peace. We'll be having another party for my second daughter the weekend of Independence Day and he'll show up for the free food. He'll pick each of my three daughters up and ask them for a kiss. He'll be annoyed when the oldest daughter refuses and the youngest screams "I want down." The second daughter is quiet and reluctant to make a scene so I'll make up an excuse to take her from him. Every time he visits I watch his every move and when he picks my children up I bite my lip to keep from yelling something rude. If he hasn't put my kid down in thirty seconds I take her out of his arms. His hands are always where I can see them and I'm not the only parent watching him. He's the oldest and only childless sibling. Thank the Lord he's never fathered a child. My sister has a son and is expecting her second child at the end of September. I have three daughters and my younger brother (he's still older than I am but he's the youngest of the boys) has a daughter. I tried to exclude my oldest brother from a birthday party once. It took weeks for my ears to stop ringing when my Mother finished with me. I never invite other kids to my daughters' parties without informing the parents, "My brother will probably be at the party. He's a child molester. We never let him out of our sight but I wanted you to know."  Understandably, the only children who show up at parties for my kids are their cousins.   My brother is listed on North Carolina's Sex Offenders Registry but he's finished with his prison sentence and probation so he's free to hang out at local playgrounds and strike up conversations with little kids he sees at the race track or grocery store. Scary stuff! I comfort myself with the knowledge that he looks creepy enough most parents automatically watch him more closely. If he wasn't my brother I'd cross the street to avoid passing him if he was walking toward me on the sidewalk. Too bad you can't pick your family.

      My five year old daughter tells wonderful stories. This morning she told me she and her Grandfather went to Hogwarts to see her good friend, Harry Potter. While they were at Hogwarts they went to a movie and her Grandfather turned into a vampire. All the kids ran out of the theater screaming except Harry and my daughter. She didn't have her wand and she was scared so Harry found a closet to hide her in then he summoned a bunch of ants. The ants ate the vampire teeth and her Grandfather returned to normal. Strawberry Shortcake and the Care Bears celebrated the defeat of "Grandfather Vampire" with Harry and my daughter.   A few months ago my daughter told me I found her in the woods and brought her home to live with me because the bad men attacked and kidnapped her Granny. She told me the bad men threw Granny on the hood of the car and the window broke. While the bad men were fighting with Granny my daughter ran and hid in the woods. She fell asleep and when she woke up I was there. One of the bad men was her Grandfather. Interestingly, "Granny" and "my Grandfather" are in almost all of my daughter's stories and Grandfather is usually violent. She has told me stories about her Grandfather locking her in a room with ants and spiders. Usually I rescue her and Grandfather escapes. In a few of the stories Grandfather kills my daughter so Granny hits him then Grandfather kills Granny too.  I ask her questions about her stories and encourage her to add details. My husband tells her, "That didn't really happen." My daughter rolls her eyes, "I made it up, Daddy." My daughter says she wants to tell stories when she grows up. I'll be her biggest fan. For now I'm writing down as many of her stories as I can.

      I love my Grandma. That's not news to most of the people reading my blog. She'll be 88 in a few weeks and she's been a widow since 1980. When my Father shredded my heart with his careless words, it was Grandma who soothed and comforted me. She never repeated anything I said to her and she never scolded me for saying what I felt. She's the main reason I never followed through on half-formed plans to commit suicide years and years ago. I grew up practically next door to Grandma and I spent more time at her house than at my own. My Mother used to ground me from Grandma's house and from church because those were the places I wanted to be. I loved school but she couldn't actually ground me from there. I got in all kinds of trouble for going to Grandma's anyway. Oh I'm grounded? See ya later, I promised Grandma I would help her water flowers this evening. My Mother would stand at the front door and yell at me and my Grandma would meet me outside. She tried to frown at me but she never could stop smiling. "You should listen to your Momma, Angela, but before you go back home help me with . .. "  Back then she didn't really need my help; now she does. She had a stroke 6 years ago and she can't get around as easily. Not long after the stroke, somebody tried to break in to her house one night and she's terrified to stay alone now. I'll post about the break in attempt sometime. My Grandma has 26 Grandkids, 34 great-grandchildren and 3 great-great-grandchildren. Except for my cousin in the Army, the family is all in two counties here in North Carolina. Most of my relatives won't or can't stay with Grandma. She won't let me stay more often than twice a month and there always has to be a reason for my stay. Tonight I'm staying because my Aunt Louise is going out of town. I'll make dinner and help Grandma get in bed. I'll get up all during the night to let Grandma's dog out and back in. Tomorrow morning I'll help Grandma get dressed and comb her hair. I'll make breakfast and lunch and hang out until my Aunt Louise gets home. I'll listen to all the family gossip and visit the neighbors. I'll read, write and edit. It's going to be great.

      Don't you just love online tests? Someone emailed me a link to a test called "What's Your Personal Style." I don't know why but I can rarely resist this type of thing. I never take them seriously and it's a good thing because sometimes the results are way off.  My Personal Style:     You've Got It All!    Decisions, decisions—so many invites to attend to, one job offer after another, so many friends so little time. No problem, you've got what it takes. You're charismatic and popular—the girl on everyone's radar. A mix of smarts, magnetism and sensitivity, you're the total package. Love at first sight can work for you, but so can a good second impression. You're as comfortable in sweats as you are in a suit or an evening gown.   Your personality lights up a room and keeps everyone coming back for more. And you can work out, volunteer, finish the big presentation, find the perfect gift for your pal, and still find time to do your nails and cuddle up with your guy.   Face it, you're an overachiever! Girl next door? True friend? Perfect love? Baby, you've got it all.   Your balanced personality is a great asset. Use your combination of emotion, intellect and natural charm to smooth out even the roughest situations.

      Sometimes I need to take a step back and look at the big picture. It eases the weight of my burdens when I remember it could always be worse.  I have to hide to write. It could be worse. Really, it could.  I could have grown up in a country where women aren't educated or I could live in a country where I’m not free to practice my religion openly. There are worse things than having to hide to write.  I have to share my house with my in-laws. At least I have a house. I’m sheltered from the wind and rain. I have air conditioning so I get relief from the heat.  I have clean water to drink and food to eat. There are people in the world who don’t have any of those things. I have more than one outfit to wear, others don’t.   I complain about not having space of my own when I should be thankful I can move about freely. Granted, I’m not allowed in one room of my house right now and I have books and magazines in there but I can go outside when I want and I can go shopping. I don’t have to stay in one room most of the time.  I complain that my children misbehave when their grandparents are here. I should be thankful my children are getting to spend time with their grandparents now. FIL’s lung disease will kill him and MIL has repeatedly said she won’t last long after he’s gone.  I should be grateful my children are healthy, safe and happy. They could be sick, scared and always in danger.  I still want my children to behave and my FIL to stop undermining my authority. I still want him to go outside if he’s going to smoke.  I still want MIL to use my 3 year old daughter’s name instead of calling her “that middle one.”  I still want FIL to be in his own place and this ordeal to end as soon as possible. I like my in-laws better when they aren't in my house calling me a selfish bitch. In the meantime I'll be referring to my list of ways this could be worse and praying for patience every day.

      My 3 year old daughter walked up to me and said, “I hate you Mommy.”   “Well I love you."  She looked at me for a long time then said, “I got bwue eyes.”  “That’s right. You have blue eyes.”  Next she identified all the body parts she knows and every color she could find and told me, “My name starts with a A.”  “Yes it does.”  “I love my Daddy.”  “Daddy loves you too.”  “I love my sissers.”  “Your sisters love you too.”  “I love my . …” she paused and I smiled, knowing she would say, “mommy” next.    “My Mahweo” she finished and grabbed the plush Mario she got for her birthday and hugged him to her.  So much for Mommy    I looked at her and saw her bottom lip quiver and her eyes cloud.  Here come the tears. What’s wrong this time?  “Mahweo don’t love me,” she wailed.   I wanted to laugh but I know better. She’s a serious little kid who will cry if you speak to her in the wrong tone of voice. I learned the hard way not to laugh about anything she says unless she includes the phrase, ‘that’s funny’ or ‘I so funny.’   I looked at the Mario she still clutched in her arms and said, “Yes he does. Look, he’s smiling at you.”  Please don't notice there's no mouth under that huge mustache.  She looked down at the plush doll, wiped her eyes and walked away happy. I watched her until my youngest daughter ran over to me. She looked at me for a few seconds, grinned then pushed me, “Go ‘way, Mommy.”  I stood up and looked back at her. She was watching to make sure I really went away. She pointed, "Go 'way. Don't like you."

      Yesterday my Father In-Law (FIL) moved in. Again.  I’m annoyed but trying to look on the bright side. The most positive thing I can say is, “It’s only temporary.”  FIL has Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD, a lung disease) so he really needs to be here right now. His stay will only last until the new house is set up and they can move in. Please, let it be soon. I want my life back.  I know that sounds dramatic and hysterical so I’ll elaborate. When FIL is here I’m not allowed to clean. Dusting or sweeping stirs up too much dust and the cleaners smell too strong and the vacuum cleaner makes too much noise. That brings us to the next requirement. During FIL’s stay I’m required to keep my children quiet so he can rest. Have you ever spent the day with a 5 year old, 3 year old and 2 year old? Quiet doesn’t happen. It’s frustrating for them and for me. They even have to be quiet when we go outside. The other frustrating element is the kids don’t listen to me much when FIL is here. If I discipline them and he hears he gives them a lollipop and says, “Mommy is just mean.” Nice.  While FIL is here our daily routines disappear. It’s not really FIL’s fault but MIL shows up at all hours of the day and night. Whenever she leaves it takes a while for the girls to settle down again. Last night is a prime example. I had the girls settled in bed. MIL was leaving so she gave each one a hug and kiss. That’s not a bad thing except my youngest daughter didn’t appreciate the gesture and I had to spend thirty minutes holding her then sitting beside of her and rubbing her back before she ever calmed down enough to go back to sleep.  It’s not that I minded doing that but my husband told his mother to be careful with the baby and when MIL spoke to her, my daughter slapped at her “Leave me ‘lone.”  She’s 2. When she slaps at you and says leave me alone it’s a good idea to take her advice unless you want to be hit or kicked. MIL hugged and kissed her anyway and the kid went in to meltdown mode.   My oldest daughter starts Kindergarten next week and I was hoping we could settle back in to our routines before that. Our routines were disrupted a few weeks ago when MIL & FIL stayed with us for two nights. I’ve been reluctant to re-establish the routines because I thought something like this might happen. I think they left last time because I broke one of their precious rules. My family isn’t supposed to visit while FIL is here and I neglected to mention that to my cousin. I was kind enough to warn MIL that my cousin was on his way over. I even told her he was brining his wife and their three kids, ages 4, 2 and 4 months. They drive an hour twice a month so their kids can play with my kids. Did I keep the rule to myself on purpose? You bet. This is my house and I’ll have visitors if I please. I figured I had given up more than enough.  When I first found out MIL & FIL needed to stay here until the new place was ready I moved my desk and all of my writing things out of the room FIL used last year during his “a few days” stay that turned in to a 5 month visit. My things are all shoved in my closet, and my desk is in the corner of my bedroom, cluttered with whatever wouldn’t fit in the closet.   MIL & FIL handed down rules I’m expected to follow during his stay but he doesn’t follow my rules. Earlier today I had a message for him so I tapped on the door to his room twice, waited a minute then opened it. He looked up at me with a cigarette in his hand. How safe is that? He has three oxygen canisters in the room along with his oxygen machine and he’s smoking. The last time he was here he went in our bathroom and turned on the exhaust fan when he smoked. Now he has a fan in the window of that room. What’s the point of the air conditioner if you’re going to open the window? FIL knows I want him to go outside if he’s going to smoke but he won’t do it. I have a few rules for my house but they’re easy to remember: no smoking inside, no alcohol or drugs and watch what you say in front of my kids. FIL is the only person who has a problem following the rules.   If you’ve read through all this whining you deserve a reward. Obviously, I’m in a bad mood today.

      Rachel gathered her Bible and purse and walked down the two flights of stairs to the main hallway of the church’s educational wing.  She stopped at the water fountain because the water in the new section was never cold.  She spoke to a few of the people mingling in the hall and hugged some others as she moved toward the sanctuary.  A group of boys took up most of the space in the narrow hall and Rachel stopped behind them to let others go first.  She didn’t mind waiting because Bradley was there, right in front of her.  So close she could smell his cologne.  One of the boys said her name and she held her breath.  Being small had some real advantages.  She stayed behind Bradley and listened.  Shouldn’t eavesdrop, she told herself but she did anyway.  “Rachel has to be the ugliest girl I’ve ever seen.  I can barely stand talking to her.”  She bit her lip and tears welled up in her eyes.  There was room to walk now so she moved and one of the boys saw her.  His eyes widened and he tried to get Bradley’s attention. Bradley kept talking, “She needs make-up if she wants to be average and cosmetic surgery if she wants to be pretty. And the clothes she wears-”  Rachel stopped listening.  She blinked but the tears fell anyway. She took two steps and collided with someone. “You okay, Rachel?” Tim's voice echoed in the hallway.  She nodded, jerked free of his hold, and walked away.

      My sister calls me to yell sometimes. I’m used to it. Today she called to yell about her husband and to let me know what happened after I talked to her Wednesday.  She called me Wednesday because she wanted to be calm when she talked to her husband that night. Wednesday, my sister drove to her sister in-law, J’s house to pick my nephew up. He wasn’t there yet. My sister wasn’t upset because that behavior is typical for her husband’s family. They leave my nephew with one of his aunts or uncles and he ends up with someone else by the end of the day. The only thing out of the ordinary was J kept saying, “They were right behind me at the light. They should have been here by now.”  My sister said she wondered what that was about until her brother in-law, B and his wife C drove up.  She said B and C were both drunk.  C nearly dropped my nephew after she finally managed to free him from the car seat. It’s bad enough my nephew was in the car with a drunk driver but it gets worse.  J hadn’t been drinking at all. She knew her brother was drunk and she still put my nephew in the car with him. J even let her 4 year old son ride with her drunk brother. My sister and I expected her husband to be upset. He wasn’t. He told her B is a good driver and J wouldn’t have let the kids ride with him if she thought he had too much to drink. He told my sister she was overreacting and dismissed her concern with two words, “pregnancy hormones.”  My sister is 7 months pregnant and miserable but you don’t have to be pregnant or have PMS to be upset by that kind of behavior. My nephew is 16 months old. He relies on the adults in his life to make the right decisions and keep him out of dangerous situations. My brother in-law said, “Nothing happened.” That’s not the point.

      I'm in the midst of making some changes to my blog as soon as I figure out what I did to make it look goofy in the first place.&nbsp;   Hmm, I thought I added a blogroll but I sure don't see it.&nbsp;Oh well I'll figure it out eventually.  This is one of my favorite times. The house is silent. My husband is hanging out with some of my relatives at the bowling alley and&nbsp;the girls are finally asleep. My middle daughter has always been a night owl and she just now went to sleep.&nbsp;If she goes to sleep before&nbsp;eleven I check her for a fever.&nbsp;Her normal bed time is somewhere between&nbsp;eleven forty-five and&nbsp;one o'clock so I rarely get in bed&nbsp;before two. By eight thirty all three of my girls are wide awake and naps&nbsp;are mostly extinct.&nbsp;My husband&nbsp;won't be home for another two hours so I get uninterrupted writing time.&nbsp;  The blog changes will wait.  &nbsp;

      Slow and steady wins the race, right? This week I spent some time reading the work over and over again with a different goal each time.&nbsp; Tedious work but necessary.&nbsp; I stopped reading to write down several ideas for future work. It would be so easy to focus on writing a new story right now and let the edits slide but I won't allow myself to do that. I want to finish this first.   I need to spend some time reading reviews at Amazon for books about police procedures. I've checked the local library but they don't have anything, a disadvantage of living&nbsp; in rural America. My husband asked what I want for my birthday, which isn't until September, so he just may end up with a list of reference books.   This week I read a Harlequin Intrigue Romantic Suspense by Debra Webb titled  Agent Cowboy .&nbsp; Today I'm starting  In The Presence of My Enemies  by Gracia Burnham with Dean Merrill. It's&nbsp;an account of the year Martin and Gracia Burnham spent&nbsp;in captivity when they were kidnapped by Abu Sayyaf, a terrorist group with ties to Osama bin Laden.   &nbsp;

      I&nbsp;don't like being&nbsp;stereotyped. Do you have any idea how much I hate hearing, “Oh, I see. No education, no job experience. That’s why you’re a stay at home mother.”&nbsp; I’m poor, white, Southern, and I live in a trailer. I was raised in a tiny town surrounded by my Father’s family. What are you thinking? If you’re like most people in society you’re thinking I deserve to be poor because I’m lazy, that I’m ignorant like all American Southerners and that I’m immoral. Do you have an image of a woman with nappy hair, dirty clothes, and bare feet standing in the middle of a filthy room screaming profanity at her equally ill-groomed children? &nbsp;Did you give me an accent, a cigarette, and a beer? Maybe you even gave me a black-eye because everybody knows poor women are abused by their spouses. &nbsp;Did you cover me with perspiration because it’s hot here in the South in the summer? Maybe there’s a fan in the window humming noisily and the vinyl floor is ripped in several places?  What if I tell you only one part of that image matches reality. I’m not wearing shoes. The truth is I rarely swear, have never smoked or drank. I don’t use drugs. In fact I rarely take Tylenol or Advil. I’m not sexually promiscuous. The only man I’ve ever had sex with is my husband and I was his first, too. I have a college degree and I purposely left the work force after my second daughter was born. I won’t go in to all the details behind the decision but my husband and I analyzed everything and agreed on this course of action. I will say I’ve been told if I can afford to stay home I must not really be poor. Daycare for three kids would cost $300 a week; I can’t afford to work. There are a few toys scattered around the living room but the girls are actually playing with them. I vacuumed in there just twenty minutes ago. Yes, my trailer has carpet everywhere but in the kitchen and laundry room. It also has mirrored cabinet doors in the kitchen, a garden tub in the master suite and central heat and air. Mobile homes have come a long way over the years and this home is comfortable and adequate. We have some debts to pay off then we’ll shop around for something bigger so each of our girls can have their own room and I can have my own space.   I have been labeled my entire life. My Mother still introduces me as, “Angela, the smart one.” &nbsp;In her mind beauty and intelligence do not mix and my sister is introduced as “the pretty one.” My two brothers are “the mechanic” and “the athlete”.&nbsp; Honestly, the oldest brother is a genius when it comes to small engines and old car motors and the younger brother is a sports fanatic but those labels are too limiting. The sports fanatic is also a handsome, single father who writes poetry, attends church and has never drank, smoked or used drugs. He’s actually very smart but never bothered with school much because our Mother made it clear I was the only smart kid. My Mother believed the only thing I had going for me was intelligence. Hazel eyes and brown hair are dull beside of blue eyes and long, strawberry blonde hair. I’m not much of an athlete when compared to my brother. I prefer a nice game of Frisbee or a hike while he enjoys basketball and baseball. My knowledge of mechanics is limited to “you turn the keys and it’s supposed to crank.” Okay, I’m not that bad but it’s close.   I’ve been disregarded because I was born poor and plain. I’ve been ridiculed because my Father left my Mother with four kids to raise, no job and no money and she had to do what she had to do for food and other necessities. She didn’t like having to use food stamps and other government assistance but it took her a while to find another job and she really didn’t have a choice. My Father didn’t show up again until after my Mother got a job and he only paid child support when arrangements were made to take the measly amount out of his check and mail it to my Mother each week. I grew up in poverty and there were few people who looked past my hand me down clothes and got to know the real me. Those people made an impact on me because they were different; they looked beyond the stereotypes. Now, I challenge you to look beyond the stereotypes and labels. Can you see the individual?

      For the past three years my husband has been working two jobs while I stay home and take care of our three daughters. Both of his jobs are physically demanding so I don’t ask him to do anything around the house. At least once a week he cooks dinner and supervises bath time because he wants to do it. He washes dishes, does laundry and mops the floor from time to time. Like any woman, I can be a real bitch sometimes. He usually just shakes his head, mutters something I probably don’t want to hear, and ignores me for the rest of the day. He doesn’t even gloat when I apologize. I know I’m a lucky woman.  &nbsp;  This past Sunday was his day off for the next two weeks. &nbsp;&nbsp;I told him I needed some quiet so I could concentrate on my edits. &nbsp;He took the girls and spent the evening visiting my family. I didn’t tell him to leave and I sure didn’t tell him to drive forty-five minutes to visit my family. He could have curled up on the couch and watched a movie with the girls while I worked in another room but he wanted me to have a real break. &nbsp;Most people don’t understand why I need a break but he does. I don’t have to tell him my days are longer than his. He knows. When our five year old wakes me up between three and four every morning with a whispered, “Mommy will you cover me up?” I climb out of bed, tuck her in again then spend an hour trying to get back to sleep while my husband sleeps undisturbed. I can’t remember the last time I&nbsp;got eight uninterrupted hours of sleep. &nbsp;  We don’t argue about who works harder because we both know he does. I couldn’t do either of his jobs, especially not the one where he lifts rolls of fabric on his shoulders. He told me the rolls weigh between twenty and two hundred pounds each but most of them are in the hundred pound range. Each roll must be lifted twice. &nbsp;I’d be lucky to get all but the twenty pound rolls off the floor. Sure, I can carry my twenty-one pound two year old in one arm and my twenty-eight pound three year old in the other arm but that’s not the same. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  My husband doesn’t expect the house to be spotless and dinner on the table when he gets home. The house is generally clean but it hasn’t been spotless in years. Kids and spotless don’t mix. I make his first hour at home as peaceful as possible because I love him and he deserves some time to relax after a long day at work. It doesn’t take more than a minute to set up his coffee pot and it’s not hard to time dinner close to his arrival. I don’t drink coffee but I’ve learned to make it to his taste. He doesn’t ask me to do that for him and he always says, “thank you” when he pours his first cup. He really is an awesome man. Not perfect but awesome nonetheless.

      I had a better writing week than expected. I searched for a writing group in my area and came up with nothing but the ad I posted on&nbsp;a critique partner&nbsp;board&nbsp;netted three inquiries. The first&nbsp;person critiqued three chapters and pointed out ways I could strengthen my characters.&nbsp; The second&nbsp;person thoroughly critiqued my first chapter and the third hasn't responded to my email. I have friends who read my work but they can't, or won't,&nbsp;point&nbsp;out passive voice or telling instead of showing. My friends are an invaluable source of support and encouragement. They&nbsp;let me know if a scene moves them when they say, "I hated the author for . . .&nbsp;then I remembered you're the author" or "I almost cried when. . ."&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I had an interesting conversation with my Mother today. She wants me to write a letter for my brother - to the Governor of North Carolina, asking for a pardon. Apparently my brother has discovered people won't hire him when they see he has a felony conviction. He believes he's being discriminated against. Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think it's illegal for a company to refuse to hire a convicted felon. I'm not Ms Popular with the family now because I pointed out the flaws in this plan.   First, his conviction was a sex crime against children. That's not going to be points in his favor. Even among criminals he's scum. Second, he may be finished with probation but I know he never satisfied all the terms of his probation. He did not seek counseling once he was released from prison and he never paid for his victims to have the counseling they were supposed to have. Third his employment record has never been good. I helped him get a job at a lumber yard one time and he worked there until he got fired for swearing and screaming at the owner, a man from my church. I think he was at the lumber yard less than four months. He stayed at his next job three weeks before getting fired because he lost his temper.  He has always had a problem with his temper and I have a few scars to prove it. He threw a dart at me once because I used the word "stupid." That word was banned in our home because he always assumed we were making fun of him. I don't remember what I was really talking about but I remember pulling the dart out and watching blood pour down my leg. Please don't try that at home, I can tell you it hurts. Most of the time I managed to move fast enough to avoid getting hit, at least by flying objects. His fists and feet are another story but I don't have any scars from those. I'm not exactly afraid of my brother's temper but I have enough respect for it to compose a letter for him even though it's an obvious waste of time. I told them to give me a few days to do some research.  They plan to approach one of the victims and ask him to write a letter to the Governor saying he was never molested by my brother. I need to call him and warn him so this doesn't leave him completely speechless. In the past when I've mentioned my Mother's belief that my brother is innocent the victim has said, "I told the truth. No matter what your Momma thinks, he's guilty." That's the extent of our conversations about the abuse. We're cousins so there's always something else to talk about when we see each other.

      I have now edited and rewritten half of novel 1. The next several weeks will be a challenge for me personally because my in-laws are moving in. They will be staying "as long as it takes" to get their new house ready. My in-laws are toxic, unfriendly people who don't know I write and I have no intention of telling them. I'll still be trying to work on my writing every day for at least an hour. When the in-laws move out I'll review my goals and plans.  This week I'm reading  The Lord of the Rings  by J.R.R. Tolkien. My husband read the books when he was a teenager but I've never read them until now. My Mother never took me to the library when I was little so I had to read what was available to me, romance novels and  The Holy  Bible .   Now I'll be reading things for the first time that most of my generation read years ago.

      With a little effort today I'll finish editing chapter 11. I could have finished last night before I went to bed but I misspelled every other word and it was already two in the morning. I made some notes then crawled in bed. I didn't meet my goal of having the first edit finished by today and I haven't set a new goal yet.  I read  Blind Side  by Catherine Coulter and  Saving Dr. Ryan  by Karen Templeton this week. The latest book in Coulter's FBI series was a disappointment. I have read all the other  urlLink books in the series  except  The Edge  and enjoyed them but this time was different. I kept getting lost while reading  Blind Side  and had to re-read sections.   Saving Dr. Ryan  is a Silhouette Intimate Moments novel about a country doctor and a young widow with three children who are unbelievably well-behaved. I liked the premise but there were things about the story that bothered me. For example, at one point in the story there's a comment about the woman being too young to have three children. The woman was married before having any of her children so I didn't understand why the age was so important. I remember rolling my eyes and thinking we now know how the author feels about young mothers. The mother in the story is 24, only a year younger than I was when I gave birth to my 3rd child. It's entirely possible that sentence bothered me on a personal level.

       urlLink Rachel Part 1    urlLink Rachel Part 2   Rachel adjusted her shirt and rubbed her hands over the denim skirt then rang the doorbell. Why had she decided to wear the olive tank-top anyway? When the door opened Shelby Morgan blinked.   “Oh wow. Rachel you look great. Did you bring your suit? Everybody is hanging out by the pool.”  “I’m not swimming.” Rachel wiped her hands on the skirt again.  Shelby grabbed Rachel’s arm and pulled her through the house.   “There are a few others who aren’t swimming either. Stan and I put some refreshments on the patio. If there’s anything you need, don’t hesitate to ask.”  As soon as Shelby and Rachel stepped on to the patio, Tim waved, “Over here, Rachel.”  When she finally stopped at the table Tim had claimed he grinned at her.  “You said you went shopping but I sure didn’t expect anything like that.”  “Does it look bad?” Her voice squeaked. Why hadn’t she just worn the usual t-shirt and sweatpants?   Tim shook his head. “You can be really dense sometimes, Rachel.”  He pushed a plate of cookies toward her. “I snatched some of the peanut butter ones for you.”  She frowned. What did he mean she could be dense? Why had he changed the subject? She dropped into the seat across from him and stretched her legs out under the glass table. The skirt rode up her thigh and she tugged it down. Now she remembered why she usually wore long skirts or pants.  Tim cleared his throat and got to his feet. “I’m going to get us something to drink.”  Rachel stared after him for a minute. He moved through the crowd like a man fleeing a burning house.  Alicia Poe, the pastor’s daughter, flopped in to a chair beside Rachel and flicked a glance toward the refreshment table. “What’s up with Tim tonight?”  “I’m not sure.” Rachel frowned. He was acting strange tonight. Whatever it was he would eventually tell her, they talked about everything. She shrugged and offered a cookie to her sister’s best friend.   “How have you been, Alicia?”  “I’m okay. I still can’t believe Abby’s been gone a year. I keep thinking it’s all a bad dream and any minute the phone will ring and she’ll be talking a mile a minute about a great sale or some guy she met.”  Rachel laid her hand on Alicia’s arm. “I still miss her every minute of every day too.”  They sat in silence for a minute then Alicia said, “I heard what Bradley said about you this morning. He’s a jerk.”  “I shouldn’t have been eavesdropping.” Rachel said softly.  Alicia snorted. “Doesn’t matter. It was still rude.” She looked past Rachel and frowned.   “Speak of the devil. Bradley’s here.” Rachel forced herself not to turn around and look at him. She sighed with relief when Tim returned with two paper cups of punch. He put one on the table in front of her then dropped in to the chair beside of her.  “Hey Alicia. It’s good to see you. I’ve been hearing a lot about this mission trip to Mexico this winter. You’re the coordinator, what do you have planned?”  While he listened to Alicia’s answer, he took a swallow of the punch and grimaced. When Alicia finished talking Tim leaned toward Rachel and whispered. “I wouldn’t drink that if I were you. Let me get something different.”  “It’s not that bad is it?” she lifted the cup to her lips and sipped then coughed.   “I’ll be right back,” he moved to stand up but Rachel waved him back to his seat.  “I’ll go. I want to see what else they have on the refreshment table, anyway.” Maybe if Alicia and Tim spent a little time alone together they would find out how much they had in common. They were both single, attractive and shared many interests. Amazing, neither had realized how perfect they were for each other. Rachel smiled and stopped at the edge of the pool to talk with the host, Stan Morgan. He and his wife, Shelby, were two of the nicest people she had ever met. She would always remember the way they had visited and cried with her on the anniversary of Abby’s death.   Stan waved away her thanks the way she knew he would then sipped the punch he was holding. He grimaced and shook his head. “This stuff is awful. Shelby forgot the sugar again.” He walked away laughing and Rachel forced a smile on her face and turned to face Bradley. She couldn’t ignore him any longer. He had stood silently beside her during the chat with Stan.   “How’s it going Bradley?”  He tilted his head to the side and studied her for a minute before he spoke.  “Not too bad Rachel. You know, I almost called you Abby then I remembered the twin who looked great in anything” he grinned wickedly and lifted his eyebrows “or nothing played chicken with a semi and lost.”  A red haze clouded Rachel’s vision and her mind. How dare he talk about Abby like that!   “Just shut up!” she shouted and shoved him. Water pelted her and she blinked. Bradley glared up at her from the pool.   “I’ll get you back for that.” His voice was low and mean and Rachel took an involuntary step backwards. What had she done? He swam toward the edge and Rachel turned on her heel and ran to her car. So what if it made her a coward? She wasn’t waiting around long enough to see what Bradley did for revenge. She climbed in the car and locked the doors behind her and glanced around. “Thank you, Lord.” Nobody had parked behind her so she didn’t have to get out of the car and risk running in to Bradley again. Her hand shook as she fit the key in the ignition but she finally got the car started. When she looked up Bradley’s long stride was eating up the distance between them. She slammed the car in reverse and sped away.  By the time she got home she was laughing so hard she had trouble unlocking the apartment door. Mr. Italian Shoes and Silk Shirts had finally been put in his place. He deserved more than a soaking for saying those things about Abby.   She hadn’t played chicken with a semi. She had been in the middle of an intersection when a tractor trailer plowed in to her. The brakes had gone out on the truck and he had slammed in to three cars that day. Abby hadn’t stood a chance in her Geo. She frowned when she recalled Bradley had implied he had seen Abby without her clothes. Was it possible? Rachel shook her head and frowned. It didn’t matter now; Abby was never coming back. Rachel released a shaky breath and plucked a picture frame from the entertainment center. It did matter. Abby’s memory didn’t need to be tarnished with that kind of talk. She had been a wonderful person and her death had left a void in many lives. If Abby had slept with Bradley Rachel didn’t want to know. Abby deserved better than a sister who questioned her innocence. Tears rushed to fill her eyes and she blinked them away. Damn Bradley for planting those thoughts in her head!  “Oh Abby. I wish you could have seen Bradley in that pool.” She sank to the sofa and alternated between tears and laughter while she talked to her sister’s picture. She jumped when somebody pounded on her door.  “You okay, Rachel?” Tim shouted through the thick wood.  Rachel wiped her eyes and shouted back. “I’m fine. I just need some time alone right now.”  Long minutes passed before Tim's apartment door creaked open then closed.

      My husband thinks it’s funny to teach our daughters to say things he knows will embarrass me. A few days ago he told me it’s almost time to start teaching the youngest something.  The first time was an accident but he figured out quickly it was one of the easiest ways to embarrass me and a little effort would get lots of results. When she was almost three, our oldest daughter saw my husband playing Diablo and they had this conversation:  “What’s that Daddy?”  “Hell. Do you want to go there?”  “Uh huh! I wanna go to hell.”  “Tell Mommy.”   She did. A few days later we were in the grocery store on a Sunday afternoon. I was waiting for the two sweet old ladies to move so I could get to the frozen pizzas. They were discussing the choir, the sermon and the new youth minister at their church when my daughter shouted from the other end of the aisle. “Mommy, I wanna go to hell!”  Those sweet old ladies gasped and told me they would pray for me. I heard shouts of laughter and chuckles from every direction and when I looked at my husband he was laughing so hard he had tears in his eyes. For the next six months our daughter greeted people like this, “I’m Ria. I want to go to hell. Will you take me?”   Our second daughter doesn’t smile much unless music is involved and she always sounds serious when she talks. About six months ago my husband started teaching her to say something to embarrass me. Just my luck the first time she actually did it we were in the library.  I was in the stacks and there was a man at the other end of the row when my daughter walked up. I said, “Hey sweetheart. Do you need something?”  “I want to watch porno, Mommy.”  The man at the other end of the row coughed. It was one of those coughs you know is trying to cover laughter. I said, “Oh you want to watch Elmo”  “NO, I want to watch PORNO, Mommy.” She said it louder this time and the man gave up any attempt to hide his laughter.    When I told my husband what had happened he high-fived our daughter. For days after that he would say “Elmo?” and start laughing.    I’m almost afraid to find out what he teaches the youngest daughter to say.

      Today is my brother's birthday. I love him even when he's driving me crazy. We were born just 13 months and a day apart and we're the middle two of four. He's the youngest son, I'm the oldest daughter. When we were in school he failed 2nd grade so I could catch up with him. He's just always been there. I've mentioned before that my oldest brother has a violent temper and I was his target a few times when we were younger. Dennis kept me out of harm's way when he could. I know I would have more scars if he hadn't been around. I'm not saying we never fought because we did but he never hit me the way our oldest brother did. He's one of the people I know I can count on when the chips are down. He's starting writing again and I'm excited because he sends his poetry to me for feedback. He exposes me to music I wouldn't normally hear and he keeps me updated on things back home. He moved back to our home town about a year ago so he's there with the rest of the family. He's a single dad, too. His 7 year old daughter lives with him full time and visits her mom and step dad three weekends a month and rotating holidays. Dennis and I have had some deep conversations about our parents and the things that have happened in our lives. There are only three people he shares his deepest feelings and worries with and I'm honored to be one of them. Dennis takes me to baseball games because my husband doesn't like sports. He's moody sometimes but I wouldn't trade him for anything.

      This week I wrote some of the Rachel story for the blog and edited four pages of novel 1. That's pitiful. I only read one book this week,   Ms. Simon Says   by Mary McBride. It was a fun read even though I figured out who the villain was really early.

      Every now and then I want to do something out of character. I get tired of the whole “Little Miss Goody Two Shoes” crap. Did you know if you’re a “good girl” people don’t invite you as many places or tell you as many jokes? Did you know if you’re a “good girl” people dismiss you as naïve and make excuses for you? Did you know if you’re a “good girl” some people will consider you arrogant, holier than thou and dislike you simply because you don’t drink or smoke or swear or whatever it is they enjoy? I think that’s why I sometimes have a burning desire to be “bad”.  When I was in college, I had several friends who liked to party. One day some friends and I were talking about our plans for the evening.  I had nothing planned; they were going to another friend’s to watch movies. I wasn’t invited because “Oh well we’re going to be drinking and stuff.” I don’t drink but that doesn’t mean I’m perched on a pedestal looking down my nose at those who do. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard some variation of “we’re drinking so you aren’t invited.” When did “I don’t drink” turn in to “I’m no fun?”  People tell my husband jokes that leave him gasping for air and holding his sides. When I tell them I want to hear the joke they give me a funny look and say, “Oh you wouldn’t like it.”  I am not easily offended but most people seem to think I am. It’s refreshing to talk to someone who doesn’t weigh every word. The other day I chatted with a guy who had some unpleasant things to say about my home state. Actually the basic theme was he hates North Carolina. He lived here for a while and was miserable. Nothing he said offended me. It was interesting to get another perspective on a place I call home from someone who has actually spent time here. I’ve had people apologize to me for the smallest sexual innuendo in a conversation. Why do people seem to walk a line with me? I’m not a saint or an angel and it bothers me to think I make people uncomfortable on some level.  It’s disconcerting when my husband’s friends stop talking or change the subject when I take my headphones off or walk in the room. Hey guys, I heard you through the headphones or from the other room and I wasn’t shocked by anything you said. I can leave a room of people speechless if I say “damn” or “hell” because I don’t usually swear but that doesn’t mean hearing other people use those words bothers me. What bothers me is hearing “she’s having a bad day” or some other explanation when I do swear.   The biggest problem with wanting to be “bad” is I never do it. I can’t even play a prank on somebody without worrying about how they’re going to feel. My husband plays pranks on me but I have never retaliated.  I could put powdered sugar in his creamer canister. No that’s too mean. What about . . ?  No. Maybe . . ?  No.   I have the same problem when I’m trying to figure out what to do to show people I’m not the saint they think I am. I don’t like the Little Miss Goody Two Shoes label but I can’t think of one thing I want to change that would make me seem more “normal” so I guess I’m stuck with it. Since when is being good something to be ashamed of? Why do I feel the need to defend my choices?

      Sunday afternoon I was visiting some of my Grandma's neighbors while she took a nap. My Aunt Teresa asked if I was having another baby. I wanted to shout an obscenity at her but I restrained myself - mostly. I told her, "Hell no. I guess I'm just fat but thanks for the lovely compliment." I admit I have a slight paunch but her comment was insulting. I think the last time I saw this particular aunt I was 98 pounds. I've had three kids since then so excuse me if I'm not pencil thin anymore. I'm 5ft 8 for cryin' out loud. 98 was probably too thin. Her comment hurt my feelings and fired my determination to get back in shape. I think 1/2 mile hike 5 days a week will be a nice start. First it's a 1/4 mile walk down the steep hills on the dirt road to wait for the bus then it's 1/4 mile up the steep hills to get back home. I should pull my five pound weights out and start using them again, too. Am I pregnant? Hmph!   The first day of school was a success. The first thing she said when she got home was, "I had a great day, Mommy." Next she said, "I have a boyfriend. His name is Michael." Eeek! I didn't expect that so soon.   My husband's twin asked if he could take the girls swimming this evening. I told him he can't take all three of them. He's not afraid of them anymore and that's probably because the "baby" is 2 and can communicate her needs/wants verbally for the most part. I just don't think he's ready to take a 5 year old, 3 year old and 2 year old swimming without lots of help. The 2 year old throws a fit at bath time at least three times a week so I immediately ruled her out. The 3 year old is questionable but the 5 year old is good to go. I have to admit if he was taking them anywhere besides swimming I would probably send all three with him.

      Today is my daughter's first day of Kindergarten. She hugged and kissed me and told me "bye" at least four times. She did the same thing to both of her sisters then grinned, "First day of school. This is going to be great." For the past three years I've been a stay at home mom. It's been wonderful to grow and learn with her but it seems too soon for her to be in school. She's so little! Really, she stands a whopping 38 inches tall and tips the scales at 35 pounds; that's small for a 5 1/2 year old. My 3 year old has been asking for her sister and crying, "I want to go to school too!" The 2 year old ran through the house calling out her sister's name. She checked every hiding place and then came back to me to say, "she gone." Tomorrow she doesn't go to school because of the stagger start program. One third of the class starts on the first day of school, another third on the second day and the final third on the third day. Friday the whole class will be together for the first time. Friday morning is another first for us because my daughter will ride the bus to school for the first time. She's riding the bus home today but that's totally different. Friday morning after I walk 1/4 mile through the woods with her I get to watch her climb on the big yellow bus then I'll walk the 1/4 mile up the hill back home, alone. Am I going to sniffle and wipe tears away every few steps? Probably. Will my husband laugh at me when I come back with big red eyes? Absolutely. He's so macho he didn't even tear up when he walked her to her class this morning. So he says. I wasn't there so he could have bawled like a baby and I wouldn't know. I think it bothered him more than he wants to admit because he said, "I just pretended I was leaving her with a babysitter for a while."

      Rachel swiped at the tears and knelt beside the grave. Organ music floated through the open church doors and she hummed ‘Amazing Grace’ while she traced the letters on the stone. A B I G A I L.  Sweet, out-going, beautiful Abby. She had loved that song.   “I can’t believe you’ve been gone a year already, Abby.  I haven’t pulled myself together yet and I just got reminded of that in a big way.  I would give anything to trade places with you now the way we did in elementary school. Remember that? Our teachers never realized we switched.”    She smiled at the memories and sat beside the grave for a long time. The sting of Bradley's words faded and she sighed. Coming here always brought her peace. She kissed her fingers and touched them to the sun warmed stone, “I miss you Abby.”   She straightened and looked at the church. She could slip in to a pew near the back. No, people would ask if she was okay and she’d probably have to face Bradley. She couldn't do that yet. She walked to her car and fitted the keys in the ignition and drove without thought until a horn blared and tires squealed. She jolted and slammed on the brakes. A truck skidded to a stop inches from her front bumper. The driver jumped out of the truck and yelled.   “Get your head out of the clouds and watch where you’re going, Lady!”   She swallowed hard and her voice trembled when she spoke. “I- I’m sorry.”  The other driver threw his hands in the air and stomped back to his truck, muttering under his breath.   Her hands trembled and her heart pounded in her chest as she pulled in to the next parking lot near the intersection. She turned the car off and rested her head on the steering wheel. That had been too close. The man in the truck was right. She needed to pay more attention when she was driving. She had been far away in her mind and somebody could have been hurt because of it. She knew how important it was to pay attention when driving. She had to get herself together. Long minutes passed before she lifted her head and looked around.   Her breath caught in her throat when she saw the boutique. Abby’s favorite place to shop for clothes. Funny, she hadn’t thought to come here even once during the past year. Abby had badgered her to come here and try on something different at least once a week. She had relented a few times but her taste was more conservative than Abby’s. Compromise had always been the order of the day when the twins did anything. Abby preferred midriff baring shirts and tight, low slung jeans. She was more comfortable in baggy t-shirts and sweat pants. Rachel snorted.  Look where baggy t-shirts and sweat pants got you.  She grabbed her purse, yanked the keys from the ignition and got out of the car.  Two hours later Rachel stopped the car in front of her apartment. The door to the other apartment in the duplex swung open and Tim Prestwood hurried to the car.  “There you are. I’ve been looking for you.” He opened the door.  She gathered the bags she had tossed in the seat earlier. “What’s up?”  “I was worried about you. It’s not like you to skip worship. What happened this morning anyway? You had tears in your eyes when I saw you.”  Tim took the bags from her and walked up the wooden steps to the apartment door.  “I eavesdropped and my feelings were hurt,” She muttered as she unlocked the door to her apartment and led the way inside.  “Tell me” he demanded.  Rachel sighed. Tim never gave up. She couldn’t figure out why he didn’t have a girlfriend or a wife. He was one of the nicest guys she knew. She tossed her purse and Bible on the couch and kicked off her shoes on the way to the kitchen. Tim dropped the bags from Amy's Attic on the couch and followed her. She made sandwiches while she told Tim about the conversation she had overheard.  “Bradley should be shot for that,” Tim growled.  “I shouldn’t have been eavesdropping,” Rachel reminded him.   Tim waved away her statement. “It doesn’t matter. He shouldn’t have said it in the first place.”  He accepted the sandwich she offered him and changed the subject. “Are you going to the social tonight after worship?”  “Yeah. Are you?”   “Wouldn’t miss it.”
