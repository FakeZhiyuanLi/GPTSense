      No, wait, come back...don't think by the title of today's blog that I'm on another rant!  I'm a big hypocrite.  After extolling the virtues of getting up early yesterday, I slept until 10:30 PST this morning.  I realize that by the time I had made my morning pot of coffee, most of my friends and family in the South and Midwest had probably already eaten two meals.  We were out pretty late last night - we went to a theater in Westwood (the neighborhood around UCLA) to see the late run of  urlLink  The Corporation  .  It made some pretty good points, but in addition to being a little long (2.5 hours...and it's not in the category of  Schindler's List  or even  Gone With The Wind ) I think it leaves viewers with an acute sense of despair.  Sure - corporations DO play a bigger role in our global economy than ever before, and a lot of what they do is harmful to their workers, to the environment, and to society.  But what's the alternative?  If you need a car, you have to buy it from a corporation.  If you're reading this blog, you're reading it on a computer monitor built and sold by, you guessed it, a corporation.  Further, at the end of the film I felt the tone had been reduced to a pep rally for all the good folks who strike me as anarchist-radicals who protest at GATT and WTO summits.  I guess we could go back to another economic system...but I can punch quite a few holes in the arguments for feudalism and/or colonialism; can't you?   (I  was  creeped out to see how big companies purposefully market and seduce small children, hoping to plant the seeds of consumerism that will flourish into a lifetime of overspending.  That was scary stuff.)  Today's a relaxed day of cleaning, putting up curtains, and unpacking moving boxes.  Oh, the joys of homeownership.

      Ok. I'm caving in.  When I started this blog, I really didn't want it to become political. I should have known myself better. I apologize to all of you for my rantings and ravings...I promise they won't be frequent. My polite Southern upbringing taught me to discuss politics and religion with caution...because inevitably you will offend. I hope what I'm about to write doesn't offend anyone. They're just my opinions, and since I can be pretty stupid about trivial issues, I hardly think I have a monopoly on cosmic Truth. But let me tell you about myself.  As early as 1990, as a middle schooler, I began listening and adoring Rush Limbaugh. If you're a conservative Republican, I've walked in your shoes. I've made your arguments. I've marched on state capitols for your causes, I've written letters to newspapers, and I've designed "principled" t-shirts touting your slogans. In 1997, I served as the Vice President of the College Republicans of Arkansas. I've sat in the living room of the governor's mansion in Arkansas with current GOP Gov. Mike Huckabee. I've told my share of Clinton jokes. I am (still, oddly) a huge fan of Ronald Reagan.  But over the past 4-5 years, I've been slowly rethinking (refining?) my views. See, if you're as hard-core and as young as I was, watching history and seeing facts (not blind ideology) can be quite a bummer.  It's easy to announce to your fellow high school classmates in 1993 that Clinton's tax hike will crush the economy and ruin the middle class...until you see that the balanced budget it created lowered interest rates and expanded the financial markets that provided the biggest economic expansion in history.  It's easy to trash welfare and say it's not the government's responsibility to help the poor, but when you hear Republican politicians tell you racist and sexist jokes over dinner and hear good Christian people say it's not the federal gov't's responsibility...or state gov't's...or local gov't's...or the Church's...and then don't do anything themselves...you gotta wonder if they really care that much at all.  It's easy to vote Republican because you believe in protecting the rights of the unborn...but then when the Republican party you help elect controls the White House, both houses of Congress, a majority on the Supreme Court, a majority of governorships...and doesn't ONCE attempt to rollback Roe V. Wade, can you take them seriously any longer? It's in their platform, and has been since 1984. Why aren't they doing anything? If you vote Republican because you want to end abortion, has it worked? Will you still vote for them because of this issue? Why? Why has the abortion rate in this country risen in the past 4 years while it declined during the Clinton presidency? Did your pro-life vote work? Will your future "pro-life" vote work?  It's easy to argue that insuring those without health insurance would be too expensive and disastrous for health care in our country, but then when you turn 21 and you're booted off your parents insurance plan, you realize there are some pretty significant holes in our country's health care system. I look back at my fully-insured, smug, carefree 15-year-old self arguing there was nothing flawed with our current system - and I laugh because I can't cry.  It's easy to argue against an assault-weapons ban because you're a staunch defender of the 2nd amendment, but then when a democrat president bans them and crime drops in this country...and the nation's liberty doesn't shrivel because of it...maybe those folks at the NRA and GOP look a little nutty.  It's easy to be a Republican and argue that democrats want to tax-and-spend, but when you see a Democrat balance the federal budget - a feat not accomplished by a Republican president since Eisenhower - it makes you rethink things. And when a president with a huge budget surplus and a robust economy leaves the country to a GOP president who creates a huge deficit and cripples the economy, it makes you feel betrayed for all those years you worked your heart out for a common-sense government.  It's easy to be a flag-waving, anthem-singing, patriotic Republican...until you realize that all the things you cherish so deeply in your country...free time with family (granted by those pesky unions who wanted a 40-hour work week), equality (voting rights for all), an expansive middle class, freedom to worship your God, a beautiful environment, civil rights, economic protection for the elderly, public education...ALL these things were advocated by liberals and opposed by conservatives. All of them. If you're a hard-core Republican and you love your country (which most of you do), have you ever thought about what your country would look like if your party had unbridled power for our 228 years of history? How can you be so myopic?  It's easy to argue that a president of the opposing party should be impeached for telling a lie to the American people regarding his sexual habits...but tell me...how hard is it to look the other way when the president of YOUR party lies to the American people and gets us in a war that kills over 900 soldiers and countless innocent Iraqi citizens?  Isn't a lie a lie?  That's what I learned in church.  Look, folks...I'm not a democrat. Far from it. I'm not telling you to go vote for Kerry (even if I do think he made a fairly compelling speech last night). I'm just saying this...as I get older, I find myself becoming less political. I read "Mere Discipleship" by Lee Camp over 6 months ago, and I can honestly say it really changed my way of thinking. I may not even vote in this election (I live in California...will my vote matter?) There are plenty...plenty...of things in the democratic party I don't like, either. I too thought Clinton was a creep for what he did. But he can't come back to elected office; further, John Kerry ain't Bill Clinton.  My conscience won't let me rest until I fully confront what I believe is the Republican party's desire to woo (manipulate?) Christian people with empty promises. Folks, I've walked in those shoes. I've seen the manipulation. I've held the coats while the metaphorical Stephens were stoned. I've even cast a few stones myself.  And I've moved on.    ps. What can I say? Click  urlLink here . Let them eat cake!

      I've been up since 4:30AM.&nbsp; Yawn.&nbsp; I have neighbors who needed a ride to LAX for an early-morning flight, and since my commute takes me past LAX twice a day, it made a lot of sense for me to drop them off.&nbsp; I've never been a morning person, but since moving out here I've found a lot more to like about the morning.   When it gets dark in Malibu, you can see clear across Santa Monica Bay to Catalina Island...and because of the way the coastline winds its way towards the southeast, you can also see the twinkling lights of Santa Monica and the rest of Los Angeles.&nbsp; This morning's drive was spectacular - the twinkling lights of LA, the sunrise, the fog rolling in off the ocean to enswirl the mountains.&nbsp; I guess I don't mind getting up so early because I know I'm always&nbsp;in for a good show.   Everywhere else I've lived, I've slept until the very last minute possible, fighting off the morning because my warm bed always seemed more appealing than another boring morning commute of strip malls, Starbucks, and Morning Edition.&nbsp; Here, indoors is about the last place I want to be.   It's a Beautiful Day.

      Random business factoid: 10% of America's jobs are in the automotive industry.&nbsp; 10%! No wonder anytime&nbsp;the news&nbsp;discusses manufacturing job loss or gain, they continually show stock photos of the same happy union workers melding a car's body panel to its' chassis.&nbsp; (Who ARE these people?&nbsp; What are their names?&nbsp; Do they earn royalties from their auto assembly superstar status?)  Tomorrow is my last day at Toyota, which means that in 32 hours, my professional career will&nbsp;fall in the other 90% of Americans who don't work in the automotive industry.&nbsp; My wife and I plan to celebrate in a pretty strange way (but then, we are pretty strange people).  There are many pros and cons to living in LA...or anywhere else, for that matter.&nbsp; One of the nice things about living here is that we will&nbsp;get to see movies as soon as they come out.&nbsp; Now, I'm usually about 2-3 months late seeing any film, so for the first time in my life perhaps I won't be a cultural neanderthal.&nbsp; There's a Canadian film showing here in LA called " urlLink The Corporation ," and it's a documentary that apparently discusses the monolithic nature of Big Business.&nbsp; Since I'm leaving my corporate-cubicle world for the ivory tower of Pepperdine (or rather, a stucco tower...everything at Pepperdine looks like a big La Quinta Inn on&nbsp;steroids...gorgeous but&nbsp;weird)&nbsp;, my wife and I thought it would be fun to go out to dinner at a big chain restaurant, see this film, and maybe pick up some cheap items from Wal Mart on the way home (especially if those cheap items were made in a developing country that has sub-standard labor conditions!)&nbsp;   I can hardly think of a better way to celebrate my&nbsp;departure from&nbsp;the corporate world.&nbsp; But, like I said, I'm weird.  Ok, I'll get off my marxist soapbox now and do something productive.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      It's a pretty well-accepted fact that since the early 90's, the Big 3 (Ford, GM, and DCX) have earned most of their profits from the sale of trucks and SUV's.&nbsp; GM certainly falls in this camp - I don't think the folks at GM&nbsp;relished the fact that the Hummer H2 was perhaps their most profitable vehicle - but they certainly didn't discourage the public's love for such a gas guzzler.&nbsp; GM is in a bind - they're losing market share fairly quickly in North America, so their long-term strategy seems to rest on their intended dominance of developing markets (China and India in particular).&nbsp;&nbsp; GM is fast on the heels of VW&nbsp;of dominating the Chinese market, where only a fraction - less than 10% - of the population currently&nbsp;owns a car.&nbsp; GM wants to change this.&nbsp; The Chinese gov't is helping them by building massive interstate highways reminiscent of 1950's America.&nbsp; What will happen to our global oil supply as more and more Chinese citizens begin using more and more gas?&nbsp; And then throw the burgeoning India economy into the equation, and YIKES.&nbsp;   But isn't there a train wreck for GM on the horizon?&nbsp; Many people may think that gas prices have risen in recent months because of political instability in the Middle East.&nbsp; While the war in Iraq certainly hasn't helped gas prices (ExxonMobil's world-leading profits notwithstanding), I doubt this recent spike is a spike - I think we need to get used to paying higher prices at the gas pump.&nbsp; After all, we Americans still pay far less for our gasoline than most other industrialized states.&nbsp; What's causing this price increase?&nbsp; Most economists attribute it to the explosion of the automotive industry in China and India (thankfully Indonesia is just a collection of islands).   So how can you, if you're GM, expect to make all your money on gas-guzzling trucks and SUV's ...and at the same time contribute to rising gas prices by aggressively increasing the world's demand for crude oil in developing states - creating the very gas price increases that will undercut demand for your only profitable vehicles?   I sure hope that fuel cell thing works out.

      Didn't I just quit a job?  When my wife accepted a job on the faculty of Pepperdine University this Spring, I knew I had to look for a new position in California, and I knew I had to quit working as a librarian for General Motors.&nbsp; It was tougher than I thought to leave GM - after spending a little over two years there, I had pretty well figured out the lay of the land.&nbsp; A similar position at Toyota Motor Sales, USA, in Torrance, California came up - and I jumped at it.  I've really enjoyed working at Toyota.&nbsp; The people here are incredibly competent and friendly.&nbsp; Futher, I truly believe that Toyota has a much brighter future than GM (or Ford or DCX) - their environmental progress is sincere and profound, and their lack of legacy costs allows them to reap a huge advantage in profits and market cap (10 billion dollars last year!&nbsp; That's nearly 10 times GM's profit!)&nbsp;&nbsp; The vibe here is different than at GM - anyone who's worked in a place whose brightest days are in the rearview mirror (a la GM) can attest that's it's a lot more fun to be with a group on the upswing.  But now I'm in my last week here.&nbsp; As much as I like it here, an academic position at Pepperdine became available.&nbsp; I've always wanted to work in academia (I like the pace of the place, and it's nice to be motivated by service and not profits), and it's a great opportunity: I'll be&nbsp;the librarian&nbsp;for&nbsp;the Drescher Campus library, a library that supports Pepperdine's graduate programs in Business, Public Policy, and Education/Psychology.&nbsp; Anyone who knows me can see why I'd love to work with that intellectual scope.&nbsp; It's a new library (in a library system with a new dean), so it (like Toyota) seems like a place with a very bright future.&nbsp; I'm excited to join them on the journey.  Plus - on a perfectly shallow level - the library overlooks the ocean and I'll have a 200 yard commute from our (recently built) home.  Who gets to live in Malibu and walk to work?&nbsp; I'm really lucky.&nbsp;

      Yet another example that I am behind the times...  Tonight I was walking around campus and saw a flier that got my attention - in big, bold letters it said "God is not a Republican. Or a democrat" and so I went to its' web site ( urlLink http://www.takebackourfaith.org ). It's put together by a group called Sojourners, a group whose mantra is "Christians for Justice and Peace." The web site for Sojourners is  urlLink http://www.sojo.net , and after looking it over, this seems like a group worth paying attention to.  Granted, probably everyone has seen/heard of this group before and I'm the big loser, but I'm fascinated. I'm especially intrigued with the fact that Jerry Falwell doesn't consider the director of this movement (Jim Walls) a true evangelical (If Falwell be against you, I'm inclined to be for you). While it's common to find mainline denominational support for social justice themes, it is uncommon to see evangelical support (I wonder if Tony Campolo is a part of this?), though Sojourner supporters are from across Christendom.  If any of you know more about this group, please let me know.

      I knew I'd face this problem sooner or later (looks like it's sooner!) Most of the good blogs I read are from really smart people who have a lot of good things to say. I'm afraid I'm not one of those people. While I certainly have my opinions, I very rarely feel the need to write Upton Sinclair-ish diatribes. Oh well.  I'm probably the last person to read this book (it's from the 80's), but I'm currently engrossed in Robert Webber's  urlLink Evangelicals on the Canterbury Trail . Ever since I spent a semester in London in 1997 (and had the opportunity to visit more than my share of Anglican churches), I've been intrigued with Anglicanism and more liturgically-based worship. I know I sound like a cantankerous fogey, but liturgy appeals to me because I find that I can focus better when random individuals are disallowed from ad libbing their random thoughts and opinions in worship.  Sure - contemporary worship has the allusion of being less stuffy, and I'm not in any way waxing nostalgic about some of the worship experiences of my childhood. However, I'm just disappointed with many churches these days that have "turned the corner" on some of the dull worship tastes of 25 years ago but have replaced them with hyper-cheesy worship services that have the theological depth of a Bruce Wilkinson  urlLink book  and resemble a flag-waving political rally. Liturgy doesn't allow my good sister to advertise her petition to ban same-sex marriages (more about that later) or my brother to rail on how our culture has never been more secular than it is today (don't show him that "nothing new under the sun" bit in Ecclesisates). Liturgy brings everyone together on the same page (literally), and because it can be vetted beforehand, allows worship to be solely and wholly spirtually based.  PS. About these same-sex marriage ban petitions...I'll be happy to sign one when they also ban heterosexual adultery. Call me crazy, but any amendment called the "Preserve Marriage Amendment" should consider the fact that heterosexual adultery probably destroys far more marriages than homosexuality. And adultery is also considered an abomination in scripture. So let's be consistent, folks.

      They're back.  Nickelodeon has been on campus nearly every day this Summer filming a new series entitled "Zoey 21" which apparently will debut this Winter.  The star of the new series is Jamie Lynn Spears, younger sister of Britney Spears (the director is Fred Savage of  Wonder Years  fame).  I think I've figured out the pattern: on Mondays and Tuesdays they film down at the central campus (Seaver College), and on Wed., Thur., and Fri. they film up here at the Drescher campus.  I know they're all nice people and I'm glad they're here, but it is a little distracting and annoying to have your campus overrun with film crew members.  Occasionally, Jamie Lynn's older sister comes to campus to hang out on the set (last week she hung out most of the day up here by the library).   On Monday my wife attempted to use the restroom outside her office but was told that Ms. Spears was inside and she'd need to wait.  Again - Pepperdine is a surreal, beautiful, amazing, and very strange place.  I saw a Bush campaign ad on CNN this morning.  He touted what he calls an "ownership" society and said that if you own your home and a business and your health care plan you have a "stake in America."  I hope the American dream is bigger than that.  I don't own my own business...probably never will...and can't see why/how the GOP's answer to every social problem is to A) cut taxes or B) figure out how we can own our own business.  See, entrepreneurial risk sounds great...but what happens if your business fails (as the majority eventually do)?  Is there any kind of safety net in place for all the failed business owners?  Ah - the thread of a safety net our society has in place should be credited to the democrats.  Just my theory - if you take away social services and safety nets, you provide a  dis incentive to entrepreneurship.  Cut taxes all you want, George, but if I want to elect a party that would encourage  me  to start a business - I'd call the democrats.  ps.  How does the ideal of an "ownership society" jive with Christ's teachings?  I'm sure since the GOP is the party of Christians and for Christians, we'll need to do some creative exegesis, won't we? :)

      Whenever I've moved to a new place, I've always been surprised by what surprises me in that city.  When I moved to Indiana, I never got over how idyllic of a town Bloomington is (I still haven't...in fact, if I could design a small town, I'd copy Bloomington and distribute it to all other 49 states so they could have one, too).   When I moved to suburban Detroit, I was fascinated by  just how much  stuff   one could put into one strip mall.  At the corner of Maple and Coolidge in Troy, for example, rests what I think is the largest and most intimidating strip mall EVER.  One should almost take a trip to Michigan just see this behemoth of a strip mall (reinforcing the reputation that yes, Michigan is the Texas of the Midwest: everything's bigger.  Two words - Somerset Collection?)  One of the weirdest experiences of living here (other than seeing Pamela Anderson and Sean Penn and Barry Manilow and...) is that I always feel like the world has already happened.  See, when I go to bed at night, I have two choices: I can either watch the late local news OR I can flip over to the BBC and watch the morning news for the next day from London.  And who wants to live in the here and now?  (No one else in LA seems to live in reality...why should I start?) I like to watch the morning news from London...and then go to bed.  Maybe that's why people here are so laid-back - by the time they (we) hear about news, it's already happened, and since there's really nothing you can do about it by then, why let reality interrupt your avocado omelette and organic granola?  Today is a good day - my favorite political scientist successfully defended her dissertation in Indiana yesterday, and since she's an elite member of Northwest Worldperks, she got bumped to first-class for her flight back to LA this afternoon (I think she deserves it).  We're eating dinner at a place in Marina Del Rey to celebrate.  It's sunny, clear, breezy, and the high will probably not top 74 degrees.

      I don't get it...since Toyota introduced its hybrid Prius in 1999-2000, Toyota and Honda (with the Insight) have stolen the headlines with their forward-thinking technologies. Toyota, especially with its 2004 redesigned Prius, seems to be leading the way on this front...forcing Ford to "license" the patents for Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive for its 2005 Hybrid Escape. Meanwhile, GM has tried to rain on the hybrid parade as often as possible, claiming that hybrids are only a "bridge" to the real gold mine of fuel efficiency: hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.  Big problems here. In order to make hydrogen vehicles viable, you not only have to have a whopper of a scientific breakthrough (nowhere on GM's horizon), but you also have to have a "hydrogen infrastructure" in place to keep these vehicles running all over the nation. Larry Burns, GM's VP for Research &amp; Development (and a really, really nice guy) insists that GM will have hydrogen vehicles on the road by 2010. Hmmm. I doubt it.  But wait...GM  has  decided to play the Hybrid game! They're busy touting their new hybrid  urlLink Silverado pickup . But how is this panning out? Well, for $30,000 (the Prius is around $20,000) you can get a vehicle that gets a whopping  20  miles per gallon (the Prius is an EPA rated 51 mph/60 mph). But wait..there's more. Instead of a nationwide rollout, they're offering it in only a few states: CA, OR, WA, AK, HA, and FL. So...GM is building a hybrid vehicle that:  A) is in a segment where few buyers are interested in buying hybrids...I can't WAIT to see how many Bubbas in Seattle decide to get themselves a Hybrid Pickup truck B) only gets 20 miles per gallon. The regular Silverado gets around 17 mph. Why bother? C) is almost 50% more expensive than other hybrids  You won't find me lifting weights in the weight rooms...I'm a big weenie and I've never had muscles. So to minimize embarassment, I usually avoid weight rooms at all cost, because when I hang around people who are clearly superior to me in that arena, I just look plain stupid.  Maybe GM should stay away from the hybrid market after all.

      Sorry for my temporary hiatus from blogging...I've been busy with my new job at Pepperdine. Already I'm finding it a breath of fresh air - the people are wonderful and I'm surprised (though I shouldn't be) at how much better my attitude is without having to spend two hours in a car each day (commutes in Detroit and LA were both pretty nasty).  Some people in the "corporate" world have the impression that academia is a strange, inefficient world of laziness. I can't say I buy that...Pepperdine has been more efficient with my setup and onboarding process than either GM or Toyota. I'm pretty impressed.  Oh, and did I mention how the ocean sparkles in the sunlight when I look at it out my office window? :)  That never happened in Warren, Michigan.  Last night I spent a good chunk of time on the phone and online with a "mystery friend."  This mystery friend and I are planning surprises for our wives this November.  All four of us are good friends, but neither wife in our relationships will know A) where we're going or B) who the other couple will be until we meet in that city's airport.  We're planning a long weekend in a location within a 2-3 flight from LAX...a place none of the four of us have been before.  I'm looking forward to it.  And no, I'm not telling you where it is.  My wife is as good of a "Google Monkey" as I am (thanks to ABC's  The Note  for that phrase).

      More politics.  But tonight I'm hopefully not partisan...maybe just quasi-analytical.   Nuanced between all the terror warnings of late, you may have noticed lots and lots of media discussion on how this Fall's election will be decided by perhaps 10% of the electorate in only a handful of states (Thanks, Jason, for sparking this post).  I think they're missing a story.   When you do the electoral college math, Bush is in big trouble.  Notice all the "battleground" states they mention: Ohio (the new Florida?), Florida, Missouri, West Virginia, New Hampshire, Michigan, Tennessee, Arkansas, Nevada, Colorado, Arizona.  What do all but one (Michigan) of these states have in common?   That's right - they all went for Bush in 2000.  So let's do the math - if Bush won all but ONE of these states in 2000, and still won the presidency by only one electoral vote....then...he'd better sweep them all this year, right?  Does anyone think the odds are in his favor?  It's my theory that Bush did about as well as he could do in 2000.  I'd like for Karl Rove to tell me which new states he thinks Bush can win this time around.  Can you think of any states that voted for Gore in 2000 that are convinced Bush is their candidate in 2004?  Bush won West Virginia (NO Republican wins WV...what a fluke!  They took their 5 electoral votes and punished Gore for his environmental record...the mining community in WV was never behind Gore.  But they are behind Kerry this time.)  He won Florida, he won Ohio, he won Missouri, he won New Hampshire, he won Tennessee, he won Arkansas, he won Arizona, he won Nevada, and he won Colorado.  All of these states are toss-ups right now (even though I think Bush has Arkansas and Tennessee in the bag).  For Bush to have some level of confidence heading into November, I would think he'd better be competing strongly in a few states he  lost  in 2000 to hedge his bets...but get this...according to current polling data, with the exception of Michigan,  Bush has no hope of winning any more states in 2004 than his "squeaker" win in 2000 .  And even if Bush can pull off a victory in Michigan (highly unlikely), if he loses Ohio or Florida or Missouri or Arizona or Nevada or Colorado he's still probably toast.  My humble prediction: Bush will actually win the popular vote this year, but he'll lose the election to Kerry in the electoral college (turnabout is fair play!)  All Kerry has to do is protect Democratic territory from the 2000 election (that's more or less guaranteed by current polls) and win  one  other state.  So forget about Florida and Ohio.  I think it's all riding on West Virginia.  And now I'm off to be vigilant.

      Thanks for the kinds words surrounding Friday's post.   To prove that I'm not disgusted by all politicians, let me tell you about someone I've recently come to admire.   urlLink Sir Garfield Todd  was a former prime minister of Southern Rhodesia who endured all manner of persecution while serving the people of his country and working to effect social justice in his adopted land (he was a native of New Zealand).  What's most fascinating to me is his religious hertiage - he was a member of the churches of Christ - and how his belief in Christ's mission motivated him throughout his public and private life.   urlLink Michael Casey , a professor here at Pepperdine, is in the process of publishing a more detailed work that covers Todd's life.  (Shameless Pepperdine plug ahead!)  Mike recently spent a few weeks in the UK doing research for this project.   I look forward to reading more about Garfield Todd; I'd encourage others to do this as well.  (I figure I've neglected my Librarian calling with all the recent political rants...back to the everyday, obnoxious business of forcing books...both present and future...on my friends)
