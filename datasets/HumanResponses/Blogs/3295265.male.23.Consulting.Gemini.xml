      It started off as a fine day. Got up early, came to work. As usual, my PC would give me some slight problems, but after a while, it would be okay.  New colleague really giving me lots of headache. Taught him thousand and one things and all he can remember is only 0.01% of everything. This is a real saddening case. Wish that I can just fire him and save my hair from turning all white.  Half hour to lunch. Wonder what's there to eat? Let's hope no more LG1 food. Getting sick and tired of the food there. Making me shirt and etc stink like crazy.  Toothache seriously aching like crazy now. Must see doc. Most probably, whole tooth will have to come out. Damn.  Phones also giving problem. LCD problem. aiii. Why do these LCDs always give humongous problems? Really cannot stand it already. Everytime an LCD fails, it stays in the workshop for dunno how long.  KTMB also another one. Giving problems like nobody's business. Wanna give them busines, they dun wan. Real tired of them already. Called them dunno how long, they dun answer. :( Hope they reply my sms.  After work, had a great time. Jessy called. We just talked about everything and anything. She was at the pasar malam. Then I told her that I'll call her right after she gets back. I did.   We talked and talked and talked for 2 hours and 30 minutes. We are just normal friends. We talked bout unique names for her kids (Zanique, Danielle, Cyclice / Celynn) and she commented a few for me (I Lai, He Lai, She Lai, They Lai, We Lai, It Lai). Both of us were just plain talking. It's hard to find someone that you can click to in just a short while. Plus, we did more than just click. We were close, quite close friends already.  Her boyfriend's coming back tomorrow. She must be really happy. Can tell from the tone on her voice.   Well, that's all for today. See ya.

      It seems to be a very long day today. Feeling sleepy and stuff. :(   Knight Online's gonna start charging really soon. Don't know whether to pay or not to pay. Why do these online games have to charge? Can't they remain free throughout ur entire life? I would seriously love free P2P games.  Samsung phones are really getting the best of me. I seem to be bored of Samsung phones already. I do not know why. They are basically something like Nokia also. Same phone functions, different name only.
