      while in college i interned for a year or two writing film reviews for an online publication called American Dreamer. i was ecstatic to find myself and my reviews in amongst the rabble and rabble-rousers at Rotten Tomatoes. i was even more thrilled to find that i could Google myself and come up with pages listing my reviews or references to my reviews.  in the years since American Dreamer has essentially been dismantled, i haven't written any official film reviews, even though i've continued to see dozens of films each month, mostly via free advanced screenings.  enter the wonderful world of blog.  rather than insert film reviews into my personal blog ( urlLink Shades of Gray ), i chose instead to create a blog dedicated solely to my cinematic opinions. feel free to leave comments, but know that this site isn't really about what you think.  it's about what i think.

      some people believe that there are angels that watch over us. Alim's angel isn't really an angel, but he did play one in the movies.  Alim (played by Jimi "THE GURU" Mistri) is living the gay life in London. well, literally. he lives with boyfriend Giles (Kristen Holden-Reid) and things really couldn't get any better. except for the fact that his devout Muslim family living in Toronto has no idea that Alim lives outside the closet. (they never knew he was in there to begin with.) and did i mention that he has an imaginary friend? actually, his friend is (or  was)  a very real person. after his mother left him to be raised by his aunt and uncle, Alim found friendship with the spirit of Cary Grant (played by Kyle "SHOWGIRLS" MacLachlan); a friendship that continues to flourish.  the upcoming nuptiuals of his cousin have Alim's mother Nuru (Sue Mathew) thinking it's high time that her son gets married. Alim has declined to attend the wedding, so on impulse Alim's mother hops a plane to London and drops in unexpectedly on Alim and Giles. with the help of Cary's spirit, the boys put on the farce of first pretending to be roommates and then that Alim is engaged to Giles' sister, but the truth will out eventually, and then it's just a matter of picking up the pieces.  though not quite the oldest story in the book, it has its familiarities; someone wishing for all the trappings of a film romance without actually realizing they're in one. the dialogue, though not strictly in keeping with the bedroom farce repertoire, is fresh and witty. (for example, Alim: "Can you believe it? She still keeps plastic on the furniture." Cary Grant: "Yes. It keeps the evil fresh.") MacLachlan's turn as Grant is a delightful imitation of the screen legend and Holden-Reid is charming, but Mistri's performance is stiff and somewhat strained (and not in a good way).

      it's spring, and couples are becoming as numerous as those cicadas Jen tells me are continuously dropping from the sky in DC. walking home from a cafe today, i followed a couple for about three blocks that had to stop every twenty paces or so to lock lips. if i see one more pair of lovebirds walking hand-in-hand, cheek-to-cheek and lip-to-lip, i'm going to run head first into the nearest brick wall.

      i feel special. tonight i attended the world premiere of Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut. yes, folks. after three years, it's back and weirder than ever. i still have no idea what the movie is about, but that doesn't mean i can't enjoy it. (besides, it has jake gyllenhaal in it. yum.)  when i purchased a ticket, all they had left were the $25 tix that included the gala reception after the film. the director richard kelly and three stars of the film (jenna malone, mary mcdonnell, and drew barrymore) were on hand for a Q&A after the screening; however, as far as i could tell, only mary and richard attended the gala. oh, and drew actually wasn't on hand for the Q&A. she was there to help introduce the film, but was apparently too tired to come back after the show.  i hate these reception things, because although i recognize a handful of people in attendance, they're never anyone i feel comfortable imposing myself on just to have someone to talk to. instead, i end up endlessly circling the party with my open bar drink in my hand, trying to look like i'm looking for someone i'm about to find any moment.  tonight, though, i gave myself a goal. my goal was to speak to richard (the director) and tell him about TheWarrenReport and our Distinguishing Features and Shooting Scripts series. oh, and also to force upon him a business card.  it took five minutes to locate the bar and procure a drink. another ten minutes of wandering about the place to locate richard. after half of my vodka tonic and another five minutes of ascertaining that it really was him (it was so difficult to tell what he looked like during the Q&A from my vantage point), i stood up and stopped him in his path with, "are you richard?" (not terribly smooth, i know, considering he was the man of the evening; but better to be safe than sorry.) i gave him my spiel, he told me to contact his agent, and i forced the business card on him anyway. mission accomplished, i fled the scene.  no one should ever doubt my commitment to sparkle motion.

      it's on days like today that i'd like to lodge a formal complaint against the universe.  my summer job isn't a bad one. it's not what i want to be doing, but it's closer than... say... working at Old Gravy. and i am not a stupid person. i can be a bit daft sometimes, but for the most part i'd consider myself fairly intelligent and possessing a degree of common sense. the point is, i could do the job... if i knew what the hell my job actually was. i was in the office for four months before this job officially began and suggested they use that time to give me a little bit of training, so i'd be that much ahead of the game when game time actually came. did they? no. now i'm only getting training thrown at me when the thought crosses someone's mind that it might be useful for me to know how to use this or to have that bit of information. and when i finally do learn this new set of skills, there's little doubt in my mind that it actually  will  be useful at some point. but then i have to spend time catching up the way i  have  been doing things with this new way i  should  be doing things. and that leaves very little time to actually be moving forward with tasks.  this is an entry level position, i've been told, and so i'm not expected to know right off the bat how to do everything. but i don't even know what it is i'm not supposed to have to know how to do. tasks keep getting tossed to me in big and small piecemealy chunks, so much so that i have no concept of the bigger picture of what it is i'm actually going to have to be in charge of at the event. now, one month away, we're finally focusing on that fact. but even now, this downloading of information isn't going so smoothly. we spent an entire meeting that was supposed to be devoted to one thing talking about something entirely different. it will still prove to be useful, but it's just frustrating because it wasn't the meeting i'd been trying to prepare myself for.  bottom line is, i work harder to ensure that next year i'm getting paid to do the things i  really  want to be doing. (not to mention the things i already now how to do.)  other than that, my day has just been filled with idiot after asshole after moron. and i couldn't get out of the parking garage at Pacific Place. the machine took my ticket and then... nothing. the little arm thingy didn't go up, i didn't get my ticket back. i had to use the stupid intercom thing to talk to one of the guys. then he was like, "take your ticket and i'll raise the arm for you. you can give your ticket to the attendant as you leave. what color and kind of car are you driving?"  "it's a black Honda CR-V."  "what color?"  "black."  "what color?"  " black ."  "what color?"  "BLACK!"  on top of everything else today, no one noticed that i'd dyed my hair. sigh.

      just got back from what may well prove to be my favorite new musical. it's not a happy story, but it's a hella funny show.  every second is delectably campy, and i made myself hoarse giving a shout out to the fabulous cast after every show-stopping number.  my only question is... when is it gonna be a movie?  and remember, "don't be the bunny."

      it is now official. i am the most socially inept person on the face of this planet. outside of, perhaps, charlie kaufman. (and, yes, i have seen the man in action... or is that inaction?) in a room full of 20 people or more, none of whom or perhaps one of whom i know, i completely clam up. alcohol doesn't help, either. booze only makes me wackier if i'm in a group of people i'd act wacky amongst if i was stone cold sober. if i'm a little reserved in a group of strangers to begin with, alcohol makes me mute. and mute + party = wallflower.  last night's social suicide wasn't actually all that bad in the grand scheme of things. i've died worse deaths. and the party of people i had infiltrated were all really, really kind. (Steven, you have very nice friends!) but i was still an outsider. and i'm not talking the Matt Dillon/Rob Lowe type of outsider either. i'm talking full-on C. Thomas Howell. just call me Ponygirl. i'll be fading into oblivion in a few short years at this rate. if Rutger Hauer doesn't get to me first. (Jen, you may want to reconsider having me as your companion on that road trip.)

      while most globally-politically-whateverally conscious folks are watching Bush's address, i'm watching The Princess Bride on AMC. except television just ruined my favoritest line in the entire movie. and they didn't even flub a bad dub and make it sound stoopid with two O's. they cut the ENTIRE line out of the movie. bastards!  oh, and in case you were wondering, it's: "Jesus, Grandpa! What'd you read me this story for?!"  classic.

       urlLink    ...something wicked this way comes...&nbsp; urlLink     though most of the world will have to wait until june 4 for the official Harry Potter day, i was lucky enough to celebrate it yesterday at a sneak preview of the third film installment.  Jen A. and Meg and I had made plans to congregate at Gordon Biersch at 11, grab a bite to eat and then join the rabid, robed fans. by the time i met Jen, she had already placed herself in line. no doubt some of the early birds in front of her had been camped out since 8 or 9 that morning. with the promise of a juicy hamburger and a beer left by the wayside once we were directly settled in line, we settled for Tacone (so yummy, but not a burger and beer) and ate while alternately standing and sitting. the security nazis at Pacific Place have some policy about you sitting while waiting in a line for three hours to watch a movie. we'd stand when they told us to, wait until they'd gotten to the other side of the food court, and then sit back down again. it's a fun little game, and we needed a way to pass the time. aside from that, we did crosswords.  once we got inside, it was every man, woman, and five-year-old for themselves. we got a Lego packet on our way in. it was the Knight Bus. out of Legos. how freaking cool is that?! we sat behind a couple of moms and their little girls and tortured the poor little kids who were forbidden to open their Lego packets inside the dimly lit theatre as we did whatever the hell we pleased and put our Knight Buses together right under their runny little noses.  i won't give anything away, for those of you reading who may actually head out to the theatres to see it for yourselves, but it was worth it. the subject matter is a little darker and the film is a little more vibrant. new actors like Gary Oldman, David Thewlis and Emma Thompson are fabulously suited for their roles. and even though the film moves at a breakneck speed through much of the material, it still comes to a considerable 2 1/2 hour running time and stands well as a story on its own.  i'll leave you with this thought (come back and laugh at it once you've seen the film):  tweet-tweet. tweet-tweet. SMACK!

      hello, weekend. friday was work, work, working lunch, work, dinner, try not to throw up from combo of restaurant-rich lunch and dinner, club, club, club, drink, drink, drunk. i said it once and i'll say it again: hello, weekend.  how does a restaurant -- in a chain that doesn't seem to be having any trouble doing business -- just disappear? Hannah and Meg and I had plans to meet at the TGIFriday's on... er... it's Eastlake or something... but the freaking restaurant isn't even there any more! it was Hooters or travel. after a brief debate, we decided on travel and ended up at Rock Bottom. it's where you end up when you've nowhere else to go, eh? we made asses of ourselves at the table quoting The Breakfast Club ("vvvp, ba-dum-bum. was that the noise you heard?"), ate until we were all ready to barf, took a walk to the market (which was closed, even the restrooms... bastards), and then scared families with small children on the way back to the car (Meg making monkey sounds, Hannah caw-ing and me barking). we're just some crazy mixed up kids. don't judge.  Hannah and i met up with Tracie, Cassie and Stewie (okay, i don't really call him Stewie, but i had to make his name fit the "ie" theme) at Stewie's place and proceeded to club, club, and club the rest of the night away.  mirrors near the dance floor in a club --  especially  a gay club -- are such a dangerous and yet interesting thing. why do people dance with their own mirror images? what the hell is the point of that? what's even more amusing is people dancing over from halfway across the room to check their moves out in the mirror and then move on to wherever the hell they're going. i suppose it takes all types.  sleep is now my only goal. sweet dreams to you.

      i'm taking fifteen to twenty minutes out of (finally) doing my dishes. i have to wait for the dawn power dissolver to do its magic. i actually burnt my spaghetti sauce last night.  have you ever seen Ghost Dad? the oldest daughter is all angry with Bill Cosby (aka Ghost Dad) because he criticized her cooking. she apparently screwed up spaghetti-Os. "how could you burn spaghetti-Os?" he asks. it hurts her feelings. i thought about that last night when i couldn't get my spaghetti sauce out of the pan. and then it was the only clean pan i had and it was either clean a pan to make more spaghetti sauce in or figure out another way to warm the remaining sauce. i scrounged around in my kitchen for something microwave-safe and warmed some sauce that way.  today i have to clean the pan. i can't stand to have it on the stove taunting me.  "how could you burn spaghetti sauce?" it asks.  it's easier than you'd think.   JOKE OF THE DAY: Two muffins are baking in an oven. One muffin turns to the other and says, "Is it hot in here, or what?" The other muffin turns and exclaims, "Holy shit! A talking muffin!"

      the time has come when i fear i've sold my soul for the coinage used to placate my pathetic needs for food, clothing and shelter. what enjoyment and happiness i've managed to glean from my existence for the past couple of months is slowly beginning to dissipate. this dementor is swooping down on me, anxious to lock its lips with mine and finish off the job.  and what's worse, that would be the most action i've seen in... never mind.  why am i made to feel as though i suck as a human being because i'm not willing to dedicate 100% of my life to something i feel no passion for? why is my ambition to fill my life with work i'm passionate about not as valid as someone's ambition to just earn as much money as they can, stick it in their ears, and go  pffbt ? (it's the American dream, dontcha know.)  i want my life back.  i want my soul back.  and i want never to be made to feel less than adequate again.

      while waiting at the top of the steps at the century ballroom in capitol hill, em and i spotted jamie cullum as he entered. i don't know if the dozen other people around us saw him or cared, but since he was walking right past me i said, "hi, jamie." to which he simply replied, "'ello."  that was all it took.  a couple hours after we sat down (we ate dinner first), jamie cullum took to the stage. in jeans and a black t-shirt with his hair mussed in that stylish 'i just woke from a doze' 'do, there was no knowing at first glance the uncontainable kinetic frenzy that lived in that tiny five-and-a-half feet frame.  there were so many spectacular and amusing moments in the show, it's hard to narrow it down to just a few highlights. but i'll try...  1) amid thunderous applause, after just a few songs, he hopped off the stage. cupping his hands around his mouth, he wandered through the tables, singing the opening lines of 'i get a kick out of you'. he wandered through tables and right up to the bar, taking a pause in the music to order himself a beer. he kept singing as he brought his beer back to the stage.  2) the story behind 'next year, baby' went a little something like this... he'd known this girl for about three years and he really fancied her, but he'd never had the guts to ask her out on a date. so he added that goal to his new year's resolutions. he thought there was a song in that, so he wrote it. he invited the girl to a concert and after singing that song, he told her it was about her. she was flattered and, of course, agreed to go out on a date with him. they went to an italian place in soho that served wine until 4am. it took about a bottle of wine and an hour for him to realize... how very boring the girl was. he got pissed and they never went out again, but the song remains as a lasting tribute.  3) the boy doesn't just play the piano... he  plays  the piano. he played with his feet (after taking his shoes off, of course). he used it as a drum. he plucked the strings. he climbed on top of it, he danced around it, and he even crawled under it to achieve every possible sound.  jamie, sebastian (drums) and geoff (bass) put on truly one of the best shows i've seen in a long, long time. and this dark-haired, sleepy-eyed, piano-playing, guitar-playing, jazz-crooning, British, Elijah-Wood-resembling ball of lightning is now high on my list of must-haves.  xo

      i so look forward to making the drive from seattle to the 'couve. not only is it three hours (or so) all to myself with the windows down and the music blaring, but once i get within seventy miles or so of the 'couve, i can tune into 105.1 the buzz (as opposed to star 101.5) and listen to what a radio station  should  sound like. not only is the music better, but the dj was nicer when i made a request and he actually  played  my request in a reasonable amount of time. when i've requested a song on star, i can listen for the next two hours and never hear my song, not to mention being called "danielle" and a "really swell kid". i've never felt so indignant. and i now harbor a secret loathing for that particular seattle dj. however, i adore the portland dj i spoke with today:  me: "i need to hear jason mraz." dj: "i'll bet you do." me: "i don't care what song you play." dj: "all right. what's your name?" me: "ranielle." dj: "ranielle?" me: "yup." dj: "okay. cute name, by the way. we'll get your song on."  not only did he repeat my name correctly (and tell me it was cute), he played my song within the span of twenty minutes. (oh, and yeah, that got played over the air. i love when they do that!) i wish i had an antenna large enough to get the station while in seattle. then i wouldn't have to listen to jerks who call me "swell" ever again.  i saw harry potter for the second time this evening. "tweet-tweet. tweet-tweet. smack!" -- it's still funny. i don't think the humor in that will ever die.

      jude, man, i really enjoy you and your music and all, but tonight's concert was like the set that wouldn't end. (visions of a lambchop puppet running around stage singing the most annoying rhyme in the world danced through my head during the last twenty minutes. at least, the last twenty minutes i was present for.) are you still there playing? are you stuck talking to the drunk ditzy trio of arseholes in the front row who wouldn't shut the fuck up? (and who you shut down --  twice  -- in the most inglorious and unforgettable manner. i loved you then more than i've ever loved you before.) if you are, you brought it on yourself, you know. you  told  them you'd talk to them over in the back by the CD table after the show.  but when will the show end? 45 minutes is good for an opening band. braden... was that his name? he never introduced himself to the audience... and you kept talking about some guy named paul, rasing a toast to him, having the audience applaud him... when i saw the sign that said the guy who opened for you was braden blake, i was so freaking confused. anyway, braden was fantastic, and i'm really sad that he disappeared before the end of your set, because i really wanted to buy his CD. and meet the man, he had  gorgeous  hair. and he looked a little like steve zahn with a shaggy mop and a guitar. but i can understand why he left. i wanted to hang around, but your set lasted 2  hours ...  then  you came out for your encore and said you were going to play a few more songs? how many songs are a few more? you went into singing your "last" song, couldn't decide which of two songs to sing, decided on both, and then your second song segued into a third song.  meg had a theory that you thought maybe if you played until the bar had to close, you wouldn't have to deal with all the jackasses that wanted to touch you and have their photos taken with you.  you had an uncanny ability to hear bits and snippets of things people were saying (and not always something particularly addressed to you), but did you noticed the woman who was standing by the bar one minute and the next second was sprawled flat on her face? jesus! the floor shook.  anyway, jude, in closing, i hope that you escape the freaks unscathed and that you find it in your heart to one day come back through seattle and croon a few songs (emphasis on the  few ) so that i can actually hang around after the show and get a damn autograph. (work comes early in the morning. far too early for me, that is.)  xo

      a six-year-old dream is finally coming true.  no, not a six-year-old's dream. not unless it's a really twisted six-year-old. with fabulous taste in music.  some time in 1998, this guy named jude had two songs on the radio. portland radio, that is. i don't know what seattle radio was playing at the time, but i do notice it tends to be on some parallel plane of existence that only infrequently bridges to the world of music it  should  be playing. or at least the music that i like that it should be playing. the seattle station i listen to regularly (because i enjoy about 75% of its playlist) seems so far behind in "new" music, especially when i visit my fam in the 'couve and hear all this great "new" stuff (a lot of times bands or singers i've been raging about for months prior) on the portland radio stations.  anyway, back to jude...  i bought this guy's cd ("no one is really beautiful") and listened to it practically every day of the first quarter of my freshman year at the u. i was homesick and a little depressed, and jude's cd became my anthem. even now when i listen to it, i get flashes of walking to hutchinson or across the quad. he has the rapid-fire word delivery of someone like jason mraz. though perhaps that should be vice versa, since jude was around long before jason; and actually i've always gone back to danny kaye in my head whenever i hear that rapid-fire of words in song. but whereas jason is oftentimes upbeat, sarcastic and a little bit silly, jude has a bittersweet melancholy tone, not to mention the ability to take his range from the basement to the rafters so quick it'll make your head spin.  he rarely performs outside of los angeles, where he's based, and whenever word would finally reach my ear that he was coming through portland or seattle, it would always be too late or i would always be too poor. but after six years of waiting, i finally get my chance. after six years of harboring a love for his music in a secret place in my heart and having his bittersweet tunes embody all the turbulent emotions of a four month period of my life, i will finally get to see the man in concert tomorrow night.  thank god. then, maybe, i can move on.  but, actually, the purpose of this post when i began writing it was to mention how  gorgeous  some of the guys who work at sonic boom in fremont are. clear-blue-eyed, shaggy-haired twenty-somethings with a little bohemian rock coffee-house air. they were, as my friend meg and i say, so very  rooney . (that's my new, hip word. spread it around like wildfire.)   i wish you wished i wished you love  [jude]

      today was my first day off in eleven -- yes, 11 -- days. this is a four-day weekend reserved originally for a trip home to the fam to celebrate papa's 81st birthday, now with the added emotionally draining bonus of putting Spice -- the cat who has been mine for as long as i can remember -- to sleep. (the party's still on, but it's on sunday, and i'll have plenty of time to cry my eyes out tonight at the veterinary clinic.) but seeing as i'd pulled 10 to 20 hour days for the 4th of july production, i thought i'd give myself the added treat of sleeping in a bit. even if it was just until ten o'clock.  armageddon woke me at 8:00am.  see, they're doing this weird ass -- but completely necessary for your safety -- construction on the concrete walkways all around my apartment building. and it should be said that unlike  every other floor  my floor has concrete walkways on both sides. both out the front door and out the back door to the lovely little balcony area. for better or worse, i was pulling those long ass days while they were working on the balcony area, so it didn't really bother me much. unless you count having to bring everything i've stored out on my balcony in to my living room. and it's not a large living room. all of that stuff is out on the balcony because it doesn't fit in my apartment and i can't afford to pay for storage. but, no, it had to live in my living room for two weeks. oh, and then there was being asked by some burly construction dude to be sure and close my windows in the 80 degree weather so they didn't get any dust in my apartment. which i obliged to do on the day he asked me. two days later, when my windows were open all day, i come home to a thin layer of gritty brown dust over every surface in my apartment, not to mention a curtain of it hovering in the air. and the stench of that sealant they're putting on the walkways... migraine-inducing.  i had noticed yesterday that they had begun working on the walkway running in an L-shape past the front doors of the apartments on the 4th floor (my floor). yeah, it's a little inconvenient to not come up or go down the stairwell i'd normally use (because you can't walk through their little area when they're working, only on either side of it), but there are three stairwells all in all, and i can use any of them. but having a drill going above my head at eight in the fucking morning on the one day i've had off in two weeks when i want to sleep in really was the icing on the cake of my week.  i can, sort of, still get in and out my front door. and since i wasn't able to sleep, i decided to do a little summer cleaning on my apartment. considering i don't think i've taken out my recycling since before i left for London. (hey, at least i recycle. gimme a break.) but there's a lot of it, and it takes a lot of trips to get it all out of my apartment. i'm getting a sick sort of pleasure in going in and out of my apartment a half dozen times, because the guy out there with the drill is conscientious enough to  stop  drilling every time i walk out. (he really is about three feet away from my door with that drill. and i have no fucking clue why, but he's drilling  up .) so, i walk out, he stops drilling. i walk back to let myself in, he stops drilling. it's a fun little game.  but, seriously, what am i supposed to do? i mean, there's only one way in and out of my apartment, and they're practically blockading it.  oh! oh! oh! and  then , i go to put all that stuff from my living room back out on the balcony area, because they're totally done with it and everything. so i move stuff around to get the back door open, since i've got it blocking the door (i couldn't go out of it for two weeks, anyway), and i open the door... and there is a strip of yellow caution tape spanning the door way at about chest height. wtf?! i duck under the caution tape and drag my stuff out to the balcony anyway.  somehow, "we're sorry for the inconvenience" just doesn't cut it.

       urlLink    fresh tex.  urlLink     after an exhilarating (and, at times, exhausting) road trip that covered... not all... not most... but quite a bit more of the country than  i'd  ever seen, this has got to be my favorite photo. apparently, somone's chicken mcnuggets were a little  too  fresh that day i actually spotted a  dead bird  in the garbage can at a gas station in Alanreed, Texas. (which, if the story my pictures tell is accurate in its order of places we visited, is in the eastern part of the panhandle.)
