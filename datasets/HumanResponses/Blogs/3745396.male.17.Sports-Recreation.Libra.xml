      When someone uses the broad term "a couple", just how many of this certain item of discussion is being used? Some speculate that a couple is 2. This theory makes sense to me because when two people are wed, they are usually referred to as a couple. Others object that a couple could be as much as three or four...  I work at Decatur Pizza Hut. One of the jobs I have is to stock the freezer with some of the many varieties of meats for pizzas in order to keep them at their freshest for the costumers. While stocking the freezer on one particular morning, I was approached by my boss. He asked me very politely to pull "a couple" bags of extra Italian sausage for the coming rush we were expecting to have. As luck would have it, the rush became greater than expected and we ran out of Italian sausage anyway. My boss then approached me again, this time not as politely...  "I thought I asked you to pull some extra sausage out of the freezer!! Did I not make myself clear?"   Well, as you might imagine, I was very confused. I had indeed pulled two bags of sausage out of the freezer. But, perhaps the freezer is infested with gremlins and they stole the frozen sausage!! No. Too far-fetched. But, maybe there were some extra bags in the corner that were over-looked!! No. I checked there. So I decided to ask my boss what he thought...  "I pulled two bags of sausage out, sir," I told him.  "TWO!! I told you to pull a couple!! No wonder we're in such a bind!!"   Well. You can imagine the way my world was flipped upside-down. All of a sudden I was living in a world where a couple meant a number unspecified, but otherwise greater than 2. Speechless, I went back to work making more pizzas (without sausage).   For those of you out there who may be more intelligent that I, please fill me in on how many a couple is.

         So here I am, blogging. I never thought I would say the word and not be throwing up at the same time, but wonders never cease. My good friend Sammi showed me her blog and it interested me so much that I decided to give it a try myself. It's really not as hard as it looks to just simply pour out your soul on paper. If you put your mind to it, you could write a book about your life in a weeks time. I personally enjoy writing about myself as well as others for the entertainment of others, as well as myself. If that sentence did not confuse you then you really need to read it again.     When does blogging become a bad thing? Blogging is a bad thing to vent on I think. If you blog just to yell at something or curse in writing, you are not a friend of mine. Should any of you bloggers out there, or first-time readers decide that you want to vent your anger in public, please do so in a responsible manner. I truly believe you will attract more readers with a civil tongue anyway.     The essence of writing/blogging is what makes it so deliciously enjoyable. I could write anything about any topic (as long as I have a civil tongue) and get away with it. If I want to say that our government is going down the tubes, I will say it; in all caps if I so choose. "THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING DOWN THE TUBES." That made me feel so much better about my life. My fingers are getting tired so I'm going to call it quits. I will write some more when I get the chance. Good night to all.

      For years I've sat back and watched the Cubs blow it. Whether it be bad off-season trades, plaguing injuries, or just really awful post-season luck, the Cubs can't catch a break and I'm getting sick of it. Experts blame the infamous Billygoat Curse for the Cubs losing history. Supposedly in the 1920s the Cubs made it to the World Series and were on the brink of winning it all. At the beginning of the sixth game, a die-hard Cubs fan shows up to Wrigley Field with his Billygoat. When the toll-keeper refused the man with his furry friend entry, he cursed the Cubs shouting that he hoped they never win the World Series again. Since then...they haven't.  They finally have the squad to take them over the hump and Mark Prior sustains the first serious injury of his career. Then, Kerry Wood lands on the DL. BAM, aces one and two are gone, leaving Carlos Zambrano to pick up the slack for the pitching staff. Also on the down side is Sammy Sosa. He has had 50+ homeruns in his last 7 seasons and he now has 20 at the halfway point of this season which doesn't help offensively for the Cubs. The fans of Chicago do have something to cheer about however. They are in second place in the Central division 10 games behind the St. Louis Cardinals with plenty of baseball left. Both Prior and Wood are healthy and the Cubs have won 5 out of their last 8 including 3 wins against the team nipping at their heals in third, the Cincinnati Reds. The Cardinals have been on an unbelievable tear winning 10 straight and 15 out of their last 17. This won't last for long and I cannot wait until the Cubs creep back into the picture when the Cardinals play the beasts of the east like the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox (who by the way are also cursed).  Come October my predictions for the playoff tree are as follows: National League: Chicago Cubs/Atlanta Braves LA Dodgers/Philadelphia Phillies American League: NY Yankees/Anaheim Angels Boston Red Sox/Chicago White Sox  The Cubs will take out my other favorite team, the Braves, while the Dodgers easily take out the Wild Card team Phillies. The Yankees wont be stopped in the playoffs as they will beat the Angels and then take out the Red Sox to make it to the Series. On the other end the Cubs and Dodgers will play to see who will take on the Yankees in the Series and I have to have faith in my Cubbies to make it past the Dodgers. Frankly, even I can't see them nipping the Yankees in the World Series, so I call Joe Steinbrenner taking home another W. S. ring and the Cubs going home cursing the Goat that will curse them for another year.

      What makes the world so hard to live in? Is it the devil at work on every person to work against you? Or is it the Lord's way of getting your attention when things go wrong? If I knew the answers to these questions, I would probably have my own magazine column or something. But, since I don't, I suppose all I can do is ponder.   Human nature allows us to sense when things are amiss in life and when it's best not to get up in the morning. The most extreme example of this can be seen in the movie "Final Destination." The boy realizes in a vision that he and his friends are doomed to die in a horrible plane accident. His vision scares him to the point of actually not allowing his friends to get on the plane. It ends up not being such a good idea as death cannot be stopped and is inevitable. I loved it.   It makes me wonder. Is our life already played out in front of us? Are we just pawns in a giant chess game between Jesus Christ and Lucifer? If so, I hope I'm one of those pawns that makes it all the way across the board and becomes a knight or a queen. I don't want to be the first pawn to be taken. Does God know I'm writing this right now? I think he does. Did he know I was going to type it before I typed it? That's what I was taught to believe; the all-knowing God the Father. But did I really choose to write this? Was it my hands typing this essay? Or is it the Will of God that types the masterpiece before you? Who can say really, but it just sort of claws at me sometimes. Like a bad itch you can't reach. I just want to know if it is me who controls my life or if it is already pre-ordained. If it is the latter, then what the hell am I doing on this Earth? What is my purpose?   If this topic gets too deep for you, you may want to stop reading. If you are like me at all however, you are just as curious to know what you are doing here. If I were to die at this computer right now...ugh.   &nbsp;   Just kidding. But seriously, if I were to die right now, where would I go? Heaven? Hell? Did I really have a chance to choose my immortal destination? Or was I simply born to go one place or the other? I know what you're thinking. "I've never seen so many question marks in a paragraph." Well get over it. I've got some thought put into this. If I have lived a mediocre life, is there some place I go for mediocre dead people? Is there a place with harps and a furnace? Deep fried chicken and whipped cream? Is there a middle of the road in Heaven? Maybe I make it into Heaven, but lived a rotten enough life that I am forced to live in the hotel room next to the noisy ice machine that keeps me awake all night. Well, in case you don't read the time of these entries, the time is 2:20 and I do sleep occasionally. We'll debate again on life changing topics another night. For now it's TTFN.

       What is a woman to a guy? Anymore, a woman is just a&nbsp;possession to brag about. I can't stand to be around womanizers. They talk of "getting some" and "choice A meat" while I comment on the way they smile or the way they are nice to everyone. I just think it's very disrespectful to talk about a woman in such a way. I see a woman as being more than just a luscious piece of ass. Woman have personalities, feelings and needs. I think the world we live in is becoming a big three-ring circus and the porn business is the ringleader...

      "...And what about airline food? What is up with that?" I've heard at least three comedians and a cartoon make that joke, but it really does interest me. Let's break it down a little...  1.) Where do they make it? The cock-pit? The storage area? It baffles me when a stewardess comes out with my meal and sets it on my fold-out tray. I am so tempted to ask her where it came from. Maybe that's why all of them are smiling. You know. That, "I know something you don't know" smile. And how does the pilot know when the food is being served? From the front of the plane he announces that food is now being served, but the stewardesses come from the back of the plane with a cart full of food. Is that a requirement for all pilots to have? ESP? Maybe that is why the crash rate of planes is so low. The pilots can sense when there are other planes in the area and...don't crash I guess. I don't really know where I was going with that...  2.) Where is the variety? What if I don't want chicken? What happens then? I don't eat. That's what happens. Why do they yell at you for bringing your own food? If you don't like chicken, you just grab a pack of pop-tarts and wait for the plane to land, but no... They make you eat their food. If you call the airport in advance, they offer you a vegetarian meal as well, but honestly, who orders a vegetarian meal? Vegetarians, naturally, but that is not the point. How many of them are there out there? 20? What are the odds that one of these 20 people will be going to fly on an airplane and then call the airport before they go to make sure they get their vegetarian meals. What an occupation that must be!! Taking orders for vegetarian meals all day long. I can see it now... "Hello, Southwest Airlines." "Yes, I was just wondering if I might be able to have a vegetarian meal on my 3 p.m. flight to Denver." "Yes, ma'am, let me just put that in the computer here...there. Ok you're set to go! Have a nice flight!"  3.) How do they make the meals? Is there a hidden stove somewhere in the stewardess station? Is there another part of the plane that is unoccupied by passengers where a big, smelly, sweaty man cooks all these people's food? Another occupation I would love to have. He's probably the joke of the day in the pilots lounge back at the airport. I can't imagine anyone who works as an airplane cook is married. For one thing, they are constantly traveling and for another, you'd have to be pretty grungy to work in the back of a plane.   The next time you hear a comedian crack a joke about airline food, ask him any of these questions and you will either get a funny answer, or ruin his act (depending upon how good of a comedian he is).

      Isn't this place great? This place we call America, where we are free. I realize I am a couple of days late, but I was caught up in the Dells Saga and forgot to write anything about it. I walked outside this morning and realized that I can do whatever I want (within reason). If I want to walk around town in a clown suit and parade on the sidewalk for some pocket money I will do so. Also, if the time is right for me to open up a book and read it, I will. Nothing stops me from doing what I want to do (except for my mother).   The soldiers fighting in Iraq have my full support, but let me add a little bit of knowledge to the people. We aren't fighting anyone. The only thing happening right now is an endless search for nuclear weaponry. How much of this have we found since the war with Iraq began? None. Ziltch. Zero. Bush has us running in circles like chickens with their heads chopped off. Who are the soldiers fighting? No one. The terrorists have fled. The only killing going on right now is the ambushes our troops are receiving from random Iraqi protest groups. We're not building a new government for Iraq. We're trying to keep government from happening in Iraq. We don't want anymore attacks against us, so we are preventing another Hussein from entering office. How long will this last though? How many more soldiers have to die before Bush realizes that it is human nature to obtain a certain order in life. For example...  A wild epidemic spreads across the world. 99.7% of all humanity dies. There are still about 20,000 people left in the world. The odds of having 2 people live in the same town are 1/100,000. The odds of having 2 people in the same family live are 1/100,000,000,000. That's one hundred billion for all you mathematicians out there.   So, back to the example. You are the only one who survives in your town. What do you do? Live life in solitude, or find others who survived? The choice is simple. You find others and try to regain order to life. The same is true in Iraq. They are simply trying to find order in a country of chaos. How do they deal with this disorder? Violence of course. This is what the troops are up against. This is what Bush is promoting.   No matter what happens, I will always be an American. No matter what happens, I will always support my country. But let's face facts, America is not what it was 30 years ago. It's going down the tubes.   America, the beautiful...How long will you last?

      Back by popular demand is the third and final installment of Wisconsin Dells saga. It seems that one of my readers was not satisfied with the way I trailed off about the girls I met in the Dells. While I had more important things to do then meet with girls, I did spend a hefty amount of time with them.   The three girl's phone numbers I had previously announced I had are still in safe-keeping. I plan on calling 0 out of 3 of these girls and I will have nothing to do with any of them. The perfect girl in the pool, however, is a different story. There were two different pools in area that the guys and I swam in. Hence, there were two perfect girls; one in each pool. I apologize to the reader who had expected the number of pools to be at least ten so that there could be ten perfect girls in the world.   Anyways, while I'm on the subject, I did get to spend some time with one of the more attractive of the girls I met. She was a stunning dirty blonde with eyes that could make your legs weaken, lips that could make a grown man cry, and a smile that would melt the heart of any male. She had a cool demeanor and a strong aura of a rebel when I was near her. As much as I tried to get close to her, her independent aura made me back down like a kitten from a pit bull, afraid that she would reject me and leave. Luckily she did neither and we talked for what seemed like five minutes but in all actuality was more like two hours. I actually had the courage to ask her if she wanted to kiss...  "No." she said. My heart sank. I was rejected. Well, it was worth a shot I had told myself. But then she added something that made my heart shoot back into my rib-cage. "I can't. My mom is right behind the big dolphin." Oh, thank God for the big dolphin. I had been saved by a six foot long plastic dolphin. I wanted nothing more than to hold her in my arms at the very least before I had to go, but it was cut short because I had to return to my hotel room for curfew.   Who knew that on one fateful night during a Wisconsin trip, I would meet the perfect girl. Someone to talk to, laugh with, and just have a good time with, without worrying about what anyone would say or do about it. I wish I could say I plan on meeting this girl again, but I don't. I do not see how that could be possible at all being in the great state of Indiana while my angel is in the equally as great, but very far away state of Minnesota.  The great thing is, I think Mariah felt the same about me. That's right, Mariah. Mariah Robinson. I leave you to ponder your own love story, reader. As I stroll off to bed wiping a single tear from my eye wondering myself, what could have been...

      The trip was such an experience, I have decided to break it down into two sections, this being the second. After touring the Big Chief Theme Park, we went to the Monaco Hotel which featured an indoor and outdoor pool (both with hot tubs). Apparently both pools feature a really hot girl in them because everytime the guys and I would swim, there she was; the perfect girl. Granted it was a different girl each time, but each one was just as good as the last (for the male readers I did get three phone numbers).   We visited Noah's Ark Water Park and got wet for a little while and went back to the hotel. That's basically all there is to say about this place. It is advertised to be the biggest water park in the world. That it may be, but that doesn't change the fact that the rides are made for 5 year olds. I rode two slides and called it quits. The convenience was that our hotel was right next door and my friends and I could just walk back when we were bored. Perhaps what made it not-so-interesting was the fact that there were no foreign people running the rides. Foreign people...that reminds me. Let's backtrack a tad...  Big Chief had a population of about 15 people in the park, not counting employees. The 15 was my ball team. The reason for the lack of interest in the park was that it was raining very hard outside and most of the go-kart tracks were shut down. The roller coasters were still up and running though and we were all about riding them in the rain. When we finished riding one of the roller coasters I looked at the line that was getting on when we would get off...not a soul. We wanted to take advantage of the vacancy and ride again so we stayed in our seats. The coaster leader signaled us to get off the ride. My coach did the right thing by asking to stay on, because we just assumed it would be ok. The coastermaster shook his head and told us in his best English that we had to go around and get back in line.   I could hardly believe my eyes. The foreigners were making us go around the whole exit even though there was no one in the park!!! We tolerated it for the first three times, but when we wanted to get back on for a fourth time, my coach became irate.   "What kind of park are you running here?" my coach demanded."There is no one here!! Why can't we just ride again?" All of us agreed with our coach whole-heartedly and then I remembered the little girl who was thrown out of the park for bumping the go-karts. She was doing less than my coach was to get thrown out of the park and I thought for sure my coach was going to be next. I find that humorous because if my coach was thrown out we would have had to go too, and then how many visitors would they have to ride more than once on each coaster?   Foreign people...aargghh.  Write me a comment if you dislike foreigners as much as I do.

      I just returned from an exciting trip to the Dells of Wisconsin. I was part of a 24 team basketball tourney and it happened to be at the Dells. We placed like ninth for any of you readers that are interested in AC ball.   There was an unbelievable amount of foreign people working in the amusement parks and hotels at the Dells. I am not prejudice towards these fine people, but I am very annoyed by them...  I'm sitting on "Cyclops", a roller coaster at the Big Chief: Mt. Olympus Theme Park. There are three employees running the ride; one pushing the buttons, and two checking the seatbelts on each side. Only one speaks English. The seatbelt checkers get to me and one of them looks at me in the most peculiar way. He looks at his foreign counterpart on the other side of the coaster and says something in what sounds to be rampant French. He nods slowly and says to his English amigo on the buttons something else in ridiculously loose French. Mr. English Button Pusher says nothing, but nods.   They continue to look at me up and down as well as give me that ridiculous confused look that so many foreign people fashion. After about (no lie) five minutes of staring contests between rider/employee and employee/employee, the English button operator says simply to me in his broken, but understandable English, "Please take hat down."   My mind rushes to a thousand different places. 1.)Why did he not say that before? 2.)What was with staring at the rest of my body for five minutes? Did they want me to take off the rest of my clothing as well? 3.)Why are there foreign people in Wisconsin? 4.)Will I ever understand French? 5.)Do they really waste five minutes for each person with a hat?  The ride turned out to be not worth the wait in the first place. It wasn't my fault anyway because I did not know I would wait five minutes IN MY SEAT!! Anyway, I think the foreigners added a spice to my trip anyway. I now know what the song "The Great American Melting Pot" meant when it played on the world famous "School House Rock".   The other part of the theme park was 16 different go-kart tracks. Every ride had at least three employees to make sure we weren't bumping their foreign cars. A little girl of age 7 was riding in front of me on a certain track called the "Trojan Horse." Around the third lap I was tired of trailing behind her slow rear. I made a bold pass on the right and caught her back tire. She spun out and was facing the other way. Naturally, she stayed put, getting looks from everyone who passed her, usually a smile and a chuckle. Finally, a foreign worker noticed that there was someone not moving on the track. He puts his newspaper down (presumably the "Daily Denmark" or the "Polish Post") and goes to turn her the right way.   When the ride finishes I watch in amazement as the little girl is being escorted, with her confused father, to the front of the part. I continue to watch as their wristbands are cut and they are thrown from the park. I continue to watch all the way until they are in their beat-up hatchback and driving away.   It was only then that a shade of guilt hit me. "That was my fault," I realized. I pondered a little while longer what I would have done had I actually said something to the foreigners about the real trouble-maker. Then I thought, "Why on Earth would you throw a little girl out of your park for being turned around!"   It must just be foreign policy. I'd hate to see what happens when someone steals something in Poland...                         (to be continued...)

      I love Homestar Runner. His is the only site that is constantly on my computer (besides this one). He is a character that looks like an elongated marshmallow wearing a red shirt with a white star on it. He has no arms, and he has a beeny with a propeller cap on his head. He has a slight underbite which actually gives him his cartoonish look. He talks with a lisp and is very ignorant about everything. That's the breakdown on him as a character. I can do no more than explain to you what he looks like. I'm not your mom or anything; go and check it out yourself.  Strongbad is kind of like the enemy of the site except that they are all friends. It's very complex for a cartoon. He is really cartoonish because his hands and his head are not proportional to the rest of his body. He has hands by the way, except they are boxing gloves. His head is a masked marauder face mask and he doesn't wear a shirt. He has this type of French accent and you cant always understand what he's saying but that just makes it so great.  What makes the site so great is that it's so random all the time. Stuff that no one would laugh at unless you were expecting the unexpected. The geniuses behind this site are my new found hope in the long-lost world of comics. I love these guys and I hope nothing happens to them like a horrible plane accident or an atom bomb explosion. This is a profession I'm really hoping to get into some day. No, not atom bomb experimenting, but webpage managing.  I'm glad I got to share a little about Homestar with you today. I've pulled many people into the site and they have thanked me so many times. One person, who shall remain anonymous, told me that the site changed his outlook on life. I proceeded to smack this individual until he cried and told me he was just kidding. The site is not deep enough to change the course of a young man's life, but sometimes I wonder...  For those of you who learn very slowly, the site is  urlLink www.homestarrunner.com . For a picture of homestar, just look about 4 or 5 entries down.

      Friday, August 20, 2004 starts my reign of terror. The freshman will not know what hit them on this day. I have enough followers to pull off my freshman hallway sweep. They are just as hungry and desperate for freshman blood as I am...  But really, that's not what it's all about for me, don't get me wrong. I can't wait for tennis matches, basketball games and baseball games. I have some new teachers this year and I got rid of a couple I didn't like from last year. I also plan on fulfilling my academic honors diploma. Enough about what I will do for the rest of my high school career, I have more important matters to attend to.  Ciao

      No longer will you see me macking on the ladies. They are not only impossible to please, but also impossible to understand, to track down, and to sit next to during a movie. It gets better. It would appear that I am wearing some sort of anti-lady spray. Every time I get the courage to ask a girl anywhere, it seems to backfire in my face and I'm once again left alone on a Saturday night. Don't get me wrong. I am not desperate or anything. Is wanting someone to be there for me too much to ask though? Someone who will hold my hand when I'm feeling depressed.  I'm sick of being everyone's brother. "Hey Dylan, will you ask Billy Joe if he likes me?" "Dylan, do you know if Bobby Ray is doing anything tomorrow?" Why not ask him yourself and stop getting my hopes up. One of these days a girl is going to ask me to go somewhere with her and I will probably blow it because I'll think she is just kidding or something. Like at the end of the movie "Dumb and Dumber." Lloyd and Harry have the opportunity to be oil boys for some swimsuit models and Harry smiles at one of the models when she says she's looking for a couple of guys to help them. "You're in luck!" Harry says. "There's a town about three miles that way, I'm sure you'll find someone there." It is here that the bus pulls away and you think the duo have blown it again. But wait! Lloyd gets the color back on his face and looks at Harry in disbelief, "Do you realize what you've done!!" he shouts at Harry. They chase the bus down before it gets too far away and knock on the side to get the driver to stop. They open the door and Lloyd says to the lady, out of breath and all, "You'll have to excuse my friend (pant, pant, out of breath sigh), he's a little slow." (This is the part of the scene we think Lloyd is the Dumb one and Harry is the Dumber. We think they have finally caught a break. "The town is back that way." The girls on the bus, in disbelief, thank Lloyd and Harry for saving them some gas money and drive off.  That's my life in a nutshell. You think I'm gonna catch a break and win a date (that kinda rhymes) but I end up blowing it somehow. I won't linger on it too long. Feeling sorry for myself is not one of my specialties. Maybe I'll have some happier news in my next post.  Ciao
