       [Blogger's note: This is my first blog posting ever, so I’m a little nervous about jumping in here. The subject of my first post is not a particularly controversial or “hot-button” issue - it concerns some of the the procedural arcana involved in conducting Presidential elections. But it’s a topic I feel strongly about, given its effect on the 2000 election... Consider this my way of testing the waters before attempting to tackle more contentious subject matter.]   Lots of people bemoan the entrenchment of the two-party system in national politics in the United States. The refrain is familiar: Democrats and Republicans, they’re all the same. [This writer does not happen to share this sentiment, but it’s out there.] The Democrat-Republican duopoly arguably has turned off millions of would-be voters from having any continuing interest in the political process. These are folks who would be engaged in public debate and participants in this democracy, if only they could rally behind a candidate who both inspired them to action,  and  actually stood some kind of chance of being elected.  Meanwhile, every emergence of any third-party candidate is met by either the Democrats or the Republicans (depending on the place occupied by the new candidate on the hopelessly one-dimensional left-right continuum) with charges of being a “spoiler.” The main effect of this extra player in the race, the argument goes, is merely to siphon votes from one of the candidates, splitting the voting bloc, and throwing the election to the other side. The outcome of the photo-finish 2000 election, in which several key states were decided by a margin much smaller than the Green Party’s share of the vote, lends credibility to this theory.  Sadly, the inherent design of our current electoral system seems destined to perpetuate the third-party dilemma. It’s a classic chicken-and-egg problem: voters are afraid to “throw away” their votes on a third-party candidate with whom they strongly identify, but who doesn’t have a hope of actually being elected. That fear leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy: in fact, the candidate does end up tanking. And, in a very close election – as the vivid example of 2000 illustrates – they end up tipping the balance of the election toward the opposing candidate who, while lacking a majority of the popular vote, at least has undivided support.  So, how can we give the “little guy” a real chance? And do it while preserving the true will of the majority of voters? It is actually possible, but it will require a change in the way elections are conducted. [It would certainly be an uphill battle to ever get these reforms implemented, but at least consider the proposals, and then decide for yourself.] The problem can be fixed without requiring any amendments to the U.S. Constitution – this is not a call to abolish the Electoral College or any other federally enshrined institutions, antiquated though they may be. It will, however, require changes at the state level, where the election is (actually, 50 separate elections are) conducted.  At the root of the problem is the simple limitation that a presidential ballot requires you to choose one, and only one, candidate. Your preferred candidate might reside in the same neighborhood of your political thinking as another candidate in the race, but the ballot does not recognize that fact, and it gives you no means of expressing that preference, in the event that your first-choice candidate doesn’t win. It’s a cold, hard truth: If no candidate gets a majority, and you vote for the person who finishes third (or worse), your vote doesn’t really count.  One possible way out of this dilemma is breathtakingly simple in its elegance: the preferential ballot. Here’s how it works. Instead of simply marking an “X” (or pulling a lever, or punching a chad) for one (and only one) candidate, you have the opportunity rank  several  of the candidates (or all of them) in your order of preference. Mark a “1” next to your first choice, “2” next to your second choice, and so on, until you run out of candidates, or until the only candidates remaining are the ones you truly despise.  When a preferential ballot is used, the votes are tallied in multiple passes. On the first pass, only the #1 choice on each ballot is considered. If any candidate garners 50% + 1 of the first-choice votes, the election is over: that candidate has won. But if nobody polls a majority of the first-place votes, then the ballots of the last-place finisher are redistributed to the other candidates, on the basis of their #2 choice. This process repeats until somebody manages to accumulate a majority of the ballots.  Consider how a preferential ballot might have changed the outcome of the 2000 election. It probably would have changed the way a lot of progressive and liberal voters thought about the Nader candidacy. Many of them probably reasoned, “I like the Green message, but I can’t throw my vote away, because that will cause Bush to win.” In the end, enough people  did  like the Green message that it  did  cause Bush to win, but that support wasn’t nearly strong enough to make Nader a viable candidate. With a preferential ballot, those voters would have been free to take Nader as their first choice, but they could also have marked Gore as their backup choice,  just in case  Nader didn’t win.  Now, at this point, you’re probably thinking, if Florida voters in 2000 couldn’t make sense of the “butterfly ballot,” how in the heck will they deal with the added complications of choosing  more than one  candidate, and  putting them in order ? Indeed, that might be asking too much of a lazy electorate. Not only that, what kind of overhaul would be needed in all the disparate varieties of vote-tabulating equipment to process the preferential ballot?  Fair questions. Well, there’s an alternative to the preferential ballot: the multi-stage election. This can be implemented in one of two ways. A run-off election can be held if the general election doesn’t produce a majority winner, or a primary election can narrow the field to two (and  no more than two ) candidates before the general election takes place. In the case of the U.S. presidential election, allowing individual states to hold run-off elections if necessary after Election Day in November would likely lead to chaos. The primary approach is far more feasible. It’s also unlikely to introduce substantial additional costs, since many states already conduct primary elections for state and local offices in September anyway. Just add the names of all the qualified presidential candidates to the September ballot, and then place only the top two vote-getters on the November ballot.  These proposals do run into some potential complications if a third-party candidate has regional appeal, but can’t muster broad support across the entire country. In fact, it brings up the very real possibility of a deadlocked Electoral College, where no one candidate takes enough states to put together a majority at the national level. This risk could be reduced if the states could be convinced to abandon – as a few states already have – the winner-take-all approach to allocating Electors. If Electors were assigned by every state in proportion to the votes received by the top two candidates (in either a preferential or a primary-style system), the results would be more in line with the intentions of the electorate as a whole, which is what democracy is all about, isn’t it?  The proposals outlined here certainly aren’t flawless, but they should be able to form the basis of a system that is less flawed than what we’re currently stuck with. It would undoubtedly take many years before such an overhaul could be accomplished. But if it holds the promise of turning the apathetic non-voter into a participant,  and  it increases the likelihood that the outcome of an election will express the true will of the voters, then it should at least be given serious consideration and discussion.

       [Blogger's note: This entry follows a much shorter format than my first post. When I started this blog, I thought I would primarily be posting longer essays. But I'm finding that the events of the day compel me to speak up, and I haven't had enough time to pull together something longer and more fully fleshed out. I'll probably end up interspersing shorter topical items (like this one) with occasional longer, more developed essays in between. We'll see how it goes, I guess.]   Is it just me, or did George W. Bush tip his hand regarding his true priority in the war in Iraq? In the final question at his news conference today, Bush was asked about "the lack of proper planning" the administration had done for securing Iraq following the invasion. He indicated that, yes, "we had a plan in place." (Well, I certainly hope so!)  And what was the very first example Bush cited as an example of that plan's "success?" That the flow of oil was not disrupted. The top thing on Bush's mind, it seems, had nothing to do with securing the WMDs, the containment or eradication of terrorist elements, or any sort of humanitarian relief. No, as many have suspected all along, it really was all about the oil.  Sure, he went on to mention other aspects of his so-called plan (such as keeping the Iraqi people from going hungry), as he continued with his answer. But the fact that oil was foremost in his mind as he first formulated his response to the question speaks volumes about this administration's true objectives and motivations.
