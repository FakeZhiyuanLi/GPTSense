       "going under"  The rise of exams stress certainly is drowning me day by day. After a week of darkness and fallen, i realised that i had always been sleeping awake for the last whole life of this year just as usual. This year, is just another year of lousiness, failure and loss - the hopes and ambitions of glory and victorious i had in the beginning of this year immediately collapsed after the losses and failings that i had been suffering till even the very present second, I screamed, moaned, cried (not that bad), bleeded, even thought of suicidal - I want to come out from this consumption of darkness, now only God above is able to heal me.  Am I losing my faith? Am I giving up? There is no faith and things to give up in the first place, life still goes on as boring as it is. I have the things I wanted-PS2, friends, internet- but don't get to use them effectively. Mental breakdown am I facing now? Can someone great enough out there just be bothered to give a pat on my shoulder telling me "dun worry, i'm with you" truly from their heart but not what they react to?  Maybe I am not making any sense here, that must be why I kept getting miserable score for my English so far. Nevertheless, this may be the very first blog that I spent some time to type, and the ever last thing that I am able to use to express my thoughts. I know that I am born to this earth with a, in fact multiple purposes. How many people out there would like to testify that I indeed have served a purpose in their lives? Maybe my absence will at least reduce the burdens and serve purposes in their lives...  Sorry for wasting your precious time sometimes to even think or care about me once.

        "Get Purposeful"    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A year had passed since I last blogged, within this one year is yet another journey to discover more in myself. Self discovering is unlike science, the more you know about science, the more you will question about it; But for self discovery is that the more you know about yourself, the more you are confident in yourself, and the more you want to make out of this short life you have on earth.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read my first post just now titled "going under", the title speaks for its content alot. I was in the state of despair then and I am sure this happens to everyone in different times. Just don't dwell in this kind of thinking too much, suicidal won't solve any of your problems, it just adds on to your parent's ever-growing burden, and it is not glamorous to die from a suicide. I don't know whether should I remove the negative post, perhaps it can serve as an example of how some pple feel.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving on, my O Levels Examination is creeping closing around the corner, it sneaks in and infiltrate my base without any warning. If&nbsp;I&nbsp;don't strengthen my defense and raise my alertness during this very dark hour, death is upon my way.  An advice to many of us here: we gotta have a purpose in our lives, know our aims well and steer towards the right direction, with priorities set in mind. Study hard not just merely for a brighter future, work hard not just to secure our rice bowl, think ahead of survival, think about winning and prospering.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think about those who will be proud of us when we strive our best and achieve in different ways, be it mentionable or not. Work hard for somebody we love, make them proud, be it your God, parents, grandparents, lovers. These are the people who want to see you soar, and you yourself are accountable to them. Speaking from experience, it's more motivating to strive for someone than yourself in everything you do.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, get a purposeful life, dare to move and ignore what people feel abou what you do. Remember that ultimately the choice is your- whehter you like it or not, you have a choice to make someday, may as well make it clear now
