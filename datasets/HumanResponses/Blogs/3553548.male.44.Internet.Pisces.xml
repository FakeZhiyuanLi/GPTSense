      I would like to say that I'm sorry about the delay in posting another blog! My last blog was posted 8 days ago. I guessed that I have been busy getting ready for my sister's vacation.  Of course, she told me that she would like to feel like that she's on vacation longer than 10 days (from the 18th to the 28th of June). I think that I did a good job so far. What did we do in the last four days?  Let me see, we went grocery shopping, ate at the Golden Griddles, took care of some other chores, hit some golf balls, and voted in an advance federal election last Friday. We drove out from Toronto to Kitchener to visit my godfather (it was his 60th birthday) last Saturday afternoon. We took it easy at home last Sunday (Because we are exhausted!). Today, we donated our mother's wheelchair to a rehabiliation hospital, enjoyed lunch at East Side Mario, and hit some more golf balls.  And we are making plans to visit the Art Gallery of Ontario, visit the new local library, catch a Blue Jays baseball game, and hit some more golf balls this week! Otherwise, we'll try to clean-sweep part of our house or the garage. Whew! I didn't say that it would be a relaxing vacation!  I'll try to post a little more often! Cheers!

      I noticed that I haven't published a post since last Tuesday. I supposed there wasn't anything interesting to say something about myself in the past 5 days. Or I might not have enough time to sit still, collect my thoughts, and write them down onto this blog. Since I have been writing down chores and stuff on my "things to do" list, I'm afraid that my list is definitely getting longer! Or am I too lazy?  Anyway, my sister and I went over to the IKEA store last late Friday afternoon. Because we heard that the store were having a clearance sale. I suppose that the IKEA store will be getting ready to release their latest catalogue for the rest of 2004. Before we even walked through the front doors, we noticed that the MIKAEL computer table went on sale for $29 instead of the usual $59.   We thought that it would be great to have that computer table in the front room in our house. And I would bring my sister's PC up from the basement. So we bought it with a few extra things (ice cube tray, plastic bowls, extension cord, etc.) for the kitchen. It took me less than a hour to put the computer table together and set up my sister's that old Pentium PC (with Windows 98).  I wondered if my best friend in Montreal has ever visited that IKEA store in Montreal. Maybe I should mention it to her. But I have a feeling that I shouldn't tell her. Because she might take one look at all the ideas and products at IKEA. And she'll probably re-design everything at her place? I don't know.  Other than that, I has a quiet weekend. But, since my sister's vacation will start next Friday, I will definitely be very busy for more than a week. Because we have another "things to do" list, too! I'll keep you readers posted as much as I can.

      Well, I'm glad that I did all the outdoor chores yesterday. But I'm afraid that today was almost a "do nothing" day for me. I was trying to work on an assignment from the music studio today. But my mind was a little bit distracted for a while. And I can't put my finger on the distraction yet. Maybe I was trying too hard to think about doing something else. But the weather was too hot, too hazy and too humid for me to take a walk around the block to clear my head. Hopefully, it will rain tomorrow morning. With an umbrella, I might go out singing "Singing in the Rain" as well as finding a big puddle to jump into. Anybody else want to join me, too?

      What a busy day today! With the hot weather coming up today and tomorrow, I had to uncover the A/C unit outside my house. And, after cleaning up the A/C unit, I turned it on. Hey! Now the house is nice and cool now!   Of course, I woke up this morning with a sore jaw (It must be due to the sudden high pressure that came in with the hot and humid weather)! While I was outside this morning, I took the opportunity to get the lawn mower out. And I was lucky enough to mow the front yard and the backyard before I heard about the smog alert in Toronto this afternoon. I really do not like to use the lawn mower during the smog alert. But the grass were too tall!  Of course, I went for a walk around the block to work out the kinks in my legs. After I noticed that rather large lottery jackpot of $17,000,000 CDN, I bought a bottle of Pepsi, a newspaper and a lottery ticket. Who can't resist an opportunity to win big money jackpot? And I'll try to keep my fingers crossed until Wednesday night.  Girls, please note that the best thing for me is a cold bottle or can of Pepsi on a hot and humid day!

      I decided to create an account here at www.blogger.com! Because I felt that it would be easier for me just to type a message and let the blogger program take care of the fine details!   Therefore, I'm in a testing or a learning stage. But I'm quite sure that I'll enjoy resuming blogging on the Internet quickly enough! Good night, everyone!  David
