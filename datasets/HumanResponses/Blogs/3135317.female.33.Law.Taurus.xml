      Managed to leave work relatively early tonight - I call 18.15hr early these days - and I met my lovely pal, Sarah for a quick drink, catch up(need to keep up to speed with all the old office politics - not much doing since I left by all accounts) - and then to the salon for a demonstration of The Most Recent Cosmetic Technology!  My mobile went off just as we were walking to the venue - normally I wouldn't have answered it but it was one of my cuter, younger, more handsome clients who was calling me after 7 from home - had to be a date! Apparently not, I forgot to add he's also a friend - who sees me very much in the same role - he needed legal advice! Should have turned the bloody thing off the minute I left work!!Anyway we walked into this normally buzzing salon to find Hull's re-enactment of the Michael Jackson's Thriller video! God! These women were hideous to look at - and after I'd turned my phone off they were even worse to listen to! At least 2 of them had to have wigs on first inspection, closer scrutiny (it wasn't that interesting) would make you question whether someone would go to the trouble of adding obvious grey roots to a bouffant extravagant affair! Either she has a very long-term prognosis and needs wigs for every week of the month or she sees her hairdresser more often than her husband sees her - if you know what I mean!! Shudder!  Sarah and I deftly swerved out of being the model/guineau pig for the evening - that went to Evelyn - a very Game Bird about 70 who had skin to die for (well she almost had). It was interminable but we dutifully boked appointments for the next week and left with almost the entire contents of the Sample box in our handbags - let's see if it works!!

      Life has returned pretty much back to normal after my Easter Cyber-Fest! Thank goodness! I was in very serious danger of turning into a geek.  I was so pleased to pick CM up the following day - he'd not had the best exchange, he'd much preferred Japan the previous year, but he'd already decided he'd be going back next year - just not to the same family. He'd tried to buy me some Chanel perfume, my favourite - bless! - but it was too expensive so I got a Sausage and a bottle of wine. I was quite touched with that - he knows my tastes. Grandma got a bottle of wine too and Grandad got a packet of Fisherman's Friends!  The house was back to normal in minutes - trainers littered everywhere, clouds of Lynx hovering in the air, cupboards raided - and more importantly, no room for me at the computer, which was merrily pinging away as he quickly got in touch with his friends, no doubt swapping stories of holiday exploits that wouldn't get passed a parental rating - accompanied by a soundtrack of Gangster Rap!  Peace, tranquility shattered - bliss!  It was good to get back to work after the long bank holiday weekend too. I used to love bank holidays when I was in a relationship but they're not so great when you are single, no-one to play with! In fact, I think I probably only really want a boyfriend for bank holidays - the rest of the time I'm quite happy to get to choose what I watch, what I wear, what I eat, which side of the bed to sleep on! I wonder whether anyone would respond if I put that on my dating site - WLTM tall, dark handsome, intelligent rugby player for Whit and May Day initially - could lead to Christmas!  Talking of high days and holidays - today is my Birthday! I've not really enjoyed my birthday over the last few years - the rot started on my 30th! I always thought I'd be solvent and stable by then but I was not even close! I felt like that was it! Life over! No chance of finding love now, not now everything has started heading south - just my pension to look forward to and the hope that there might be a nice-looking orderly in my Nursing Home to change my incontinence pads! Last year was even worse - my Mum had booked a table for me and CM at my friend's new restaurant. How sad was that! Going for a candle-lit meal with your 12 year old! It actually turned out to be ok - typical type of date really - he insisted I choose the cheapest thing on the Menu, suggested we just had the one course, had 2 drinks (of Coke) for every one of mine, and wanted to go home to watch the football as soon as we'd eaten!  I feel a bit more positive this year - don't know if it's cos it's a beautiful sunny day and I don't have to go to work - or if it's an indication that my mood is improving generally. I'm even going out tonight - in public with grown-ups and everything!! I normally get loads of cards but I wasn't expecting many this year - new job, no-one knows me properly yet and my former colleagues won't be bothered now that I won't be buying them cakes for the staffroom anymore. I didn't get as many but I've been really touched by those that have remembered! My proper friends! One of my old secretaries even called round an hour ago with a bottle of wine and a card! I'm surprised she's still talking to me after I didn't take her with me to my new job - then again I'm surprised that the one I did take is still talking to me after sharing a room with me for the first 6 weeks! You always take it out on the people closest to you!!  And I got some fab presents - a DVD player!! How big is that?!! I wasn't expecting to be that spoilt. My video broke ages ago and I've been thinking of getting CM one for Christmas for a couple of years. It came with "Captain Corelli's Mandolin" (loved the book - saw the film set when I was holidaying in Cephalonia a few years ago) and "Love actually! - I think I must be the only person who hasn't seen it! I'll look forward to that tomorrow night! Accompanied by the wine and the last of my solitary Easter Egg! And I got some CDs - Bay City Rollers Greatest Hits and Jamie Cullum! CM's going to hate car journeys to rugby training over the next few months!  And I've been getting lovely text messages from a chap I've been talking to on here - he even rang me earlier to say a brief hello - he's staying with family in the next town for the weekend - which is ironic cos I'm about to set off to stay with a friend who lives just round the corner from him in West Yorkshire. He wants to meet me - he's been wanting to for a few weeks but I still haven't plucked up the courage. It's not that I'm that afraid anymore - I was! I convinced myself he was a stalker and I was kicking myself for having revealed so many personal details - I didn't dare leave the office at lunchtime in case he was watching me from a bar or shop, following me, clocking me buying my Shapers lunch! Fortunately my imagination, and ego, turned out to be rather larger than his desire to boil my bunny!  I quite enjoy the attention and excitement, if we meet that might disappear! He'll realise my hour-glass figure is more an hour-and-half  and that I inherited Grandma's chin! And he might have awful slip-on shoes, and wear white socks! I'd hate him to see any disappointment register momentarily across my face. What could be even worse than that, would be if we actually got on - that might lead to something else - ultimately sex! Think I'd prefer to clock up a few more visits to the Cheese Nazi's scales before I run the risk of letting another man near my jiggly bits!  Any way, it's too late now - got to head for Leeds! Want to arrive early enough to have a glass of bubbly while I open the fabulous small beautifully packaged gift that Eva is bound to have bought me! She has impeccable taste and the luxury of being able to shop in the Victoria Quarter - the frozen food shops, poundstores and Gregg's on my local high street don't quite have the same appeal! Not sure exactly what we are going to be doing tonight! I've fought bitterly to stay in for the last couple of years every time I've gone over to Leeds but tonight I fancy painting the town red! We will eat somewhere - we tried to book a table at Anthony's, the newest hippest eatery to open - chef from El Bulli, the Spanish El Dorado which we both read about and aspire to - but it was full. Eva always persuades me to be a bit more extravagant than I might otherwise be - and I must confess that it doesn't take much doing! I can't help it - I'm a Taurean! I'm supposed to have a large appetite for all things fabulous, decadent, rich and exotic!  Might end up at a hip happening club later - fancy throwing a few shapes about the dance floor, may even meet a handsome, younger foreign  Adonis who I can snog to my heart's content, inhibitions anaesthetised by the champers, safe in the knowledge that I'll never have to see him again! Leeds is very good for that sort of thing - or at least it was the last time I allowed myself to be dragged out, kicking and screaming!  We've had some cracking evenings, and very early mornings being flung about a club or later Eva's lounge, by nimble nifty Italian waiters - they can all dance so well and enjoy the petting but understand "no", being good Catholic boys who wouldn't want anyone to disrespect their sisters.  Whatever, I'm quite liking being 33 so far!

      What a strange weekend it's been! I really shouldn't be left unsupervised! My teenage son, fondly referred to as the Cashmonster (CM), has been away on a school exchange for the last 2 weeks and I've taken full advantage of the opportunity to get clicking on the Internet! My eyes have been opened, I can tell you!  I discovered Internet Dating recently! I'm addicted! I haven't really bothered with the opposite sex for the last few years!There is a story behind it but it is far too painful to reveal on our first meeting! Anyway, I've become somewhat of an overnight success!I'd never even stepped foot in a Chat room before - thought msn was just a place where kids get groomed by bogus sinister characters  - certainly not a place for an intelligent, moderately successful, independent working single mum from a back-water in Lincolnshire to spend her leisure time! Gosh! Am I a quick learner though!  It all started about 3 or 4 weeks ago! The CM was out doing what he does best - wasting my hard-earned money down the local High Street with his baseball-becapped spotty mates! I had a sinkful of pots and a kitchen floor that had more flora on it than a small tropical rainforest along the amazon! It was so awful in that kitchen that even the ants were starting to complain!I'm very good at multi-tasking so I decided to have a click about on the computer whilst sipping coffee and procrastinating!  I'd bought the new computer at Christmas for the CM! I'd had a bit of a play about on it when it was first installed - checked out the BBC - booked tickets to see Mastermind being filmed (? don't ask!) - subscribed to the National Trust newsletter - entered a few competitions - tried to find Martin Johnson's home number! You know, the usual! Well, a friend had told me about a dating site which was supposed to be very good with a high success rate of marriages to handsome, intelligent, wealthy doctors! Needless to say, I'd checked it out - even posted an anonymous profile but I wasn't prepared to go as far as subscribing to it! I wasn't going to pay good money to be ignored by men in my spare room as well as in the supermarket, bar, workplace! So I'd forgotten all about it!  This particular day I was merrily deleting spam from my Inbox when I came across a free introduction to a new dating site! On impulse I clicked on it and decided to have a nosy about! I was a little bit circumspect when I saw it was obviously very adult-orientated but I'm a broad-minded girl! (well, actually that's not quite true - I pretend to be but when it comes down to the nitty gritty Sunday school had a very strong early influence in my life!) Anyway, I ticked all the boxes so as to ensure I could see all the site had to offer! Who can blame me - everyone pretends to be what they're not on here apparently! What harm's one more 32 year old bored mum masquerading as a bisexual, dominatrix, swinger going to do? Anyway, within minutes people are trying to talk to me! I was terrified! There was a 22 year old couple in Burnley who obviously believed in share and share alike! A 39 year old guy from a South coast seaside retirement town who was clearly very proud of his satin bedspread! And then a guy of a similar age to me from an East coast resort not too far away from me! I decided to try and talk to him!   Me: "Hello! How's the weather in Ethelthorpe-by-Sea today?"  King Kong: "So you here to talk dirty then? How big are your tits?!"  Me: Gulp!   KK: Do you take it up the dark way?  Me: (delay where I wasn't sure if he'd be offended if I just left the room at a rapid pace, I'm new to these things remember! What if he could see me on the webcam I'd bought CM) I'm really sorry, Mr Kong! I seem to have stumbled in here by mistake - terribly sorry to waste your time! have a good day!  KK: (suddenly and strangely softer tone to his text) Hey, that's ok, Cherrypie69! (ok! OK!-I was just trying to fit in remember!) It's not really my type of thing either if truth be told! Much prefer a pint with my mates and a game of snooker! Why don't you try www.singlesaferand freetowomen.co.uk!  And it was as simple as that! I've not been back to www.hotrampantscarypeople.co.uk, not even to remove my profile! I bet I'm the biggest prick-tease on their! Some poor guy with a fetish about being ignored is having a rare old party, I'll wager!  But I have joined the tipped site! My ability to attract the opposite sex has mulitplied ten-fold at least! I got carried away after the second night - helped along by a few glasses of wine! Well, here's a woman who never had a shortage of admirers in her youth but had spent the last 2 years sitting on her sofa with her wine bottle and the remote control for company every night about as attractive as Waynetta Slob when she's not making the effort!! I'd suddenly got half a dozen men from all over the place wanting to talk to me! I even got crushed on by a very handsome, young Italian guy, so you can understand a girl's head can be turned! They all wanted to know what I looked like!  So you can perhaps see how easy it might be to have a momentary lapse of sanity! I posted my picture there! My gorgeous new friends shouldn't be deprived of being able to see the vision of loveliness that is this witty, edgy, feisty sex-kitten they're beginning to fall in love with! It seemed like such a good idea at the time! I really must start a campaign to fit breathalysers to computers ( and mobile phones but that's a topic for another day)!   You may or may not know that it usually takes a site-provider a few days to approve the profiles and pictures that people post onto it! Make sure it's not indecent, illegal, libellous etc. (not something www.hotrampantscarypeople.co.uk spent much time on!) So it was quite a surprise 2 days later when I check my e-mails during my lunchhour and see a message from the dating site proudly informing me my smiling mug was now being published to the world at large! AAaaaaaarggghh! Panic! It didn't seem quite such a good idea in the sober light of day! Particularly given that I'd used the only digital shot I had access to, my work's publicity shot - which was due to be published in the local daily paperwith a readership of about 250,000! That afternoon was one of the longest of my life! I was supposed to be going straight to my weekly Fat Club after work but instead I dashed home and sped into the backroom to quickly remove it before too much damage was done! I figured most people would still be on their way home from work before 6 so I might be able to remove it before too much damage was done!  Nnnnnnnnoooooooooooooooooooooo! " Your picture can not be edited for 72 hours!"   I was stuck up there, approachably grinning at hundreds of strangers and, even worse thought, people that might know me! Despair! Horror! I was tempted to collapse sobbing in a corner but I'd already paid my subsription to be routinely and publicly humiliated on the scales at the local Church Hall! And on the bright side - I'd not had a problem with constipation or water-retention that day! I'd worry about it later after I'd bounced about the community centre with my fellow salad-dodgers!  In my defense, I was probably already in a mild state of euphoria, brought on by the irritatingly pert Cheese Nazi declaring (in a far too amazed tone for my liking!) that I'd lost 2 whole pounds in a week! So when I eventually logged back on, the realisation that in the space of less than 6 hours 56 men had all been interested enough by my mugshot to click on my profile and learn more about me actually gave me a bit of a buzz! And as I watched they kept coming, from all over the place, Barnsley, Bristol, Ghana, Guadeloupe! These men were either all blind or I didn't look completely like Hattie Jacques and Bernard Mannings love child!   Anyway, I've not really looked back since! I did remove my picture after the obligatory 3 days by which time I'd had almost 200 hits and loads of men wanting to chat - some more successfully than others! I was lapping it up! I was a Cyber-Goddess! I've made new friends all over the place, I've started to brush up on my rusty school-girl French (with varying degrees of appreciation) and I have about 4 or 5 apparently intelligent and not-too-unattractive (if they are using their own image that is) eligible-sounding suitors vying for the chance to have the pleasure of accompanying me on a date!I've had a couple who are only there for the cyber-sex too! I was very good at dodging it at first, but then I came over all Mrs Robinson with a 20 year old postman from a town not too far away from me! It was actually quite good fun!   I've come to a bit of a halt though! It's getting increasingly difficult to justify chatting to these lovely male companions every night and not take that next step of actually meeting them, in a safe public place you understand! I've made a number of different excuses - all of which translate into "I'm too scared! Let's just stay here where it's safe and you can go on thinking I'm the witty, sexy, glamorous, successful Woman-of -your-Dreams!" I've also spoken to a couple on the phone! That can be a bit odd! How do you tell someone you've been flirting with for the last 3 weeks, who you had imagined with the voice of Barry White, that they sound more like Kenneth Williams!? Very disappointing for a girl!   Anyway - I'll let you know if there any developments! I'm gonna just log back on for a few minutes - just in case Colin Firth got connected!  ;-) x C

      I took the hire car for a spin this afternoon - to meet a man. I was a bit nervous, Jack was also worried for my sanity and decided to come along with his friend as an unseen body guard. They were all set to cut holes in my Sunday Times and Boo picked a spot at the top of a very tall tower from which they could maintain discreet surveillance. I gave them a fistful of notes though, so they had soon forgotten all about me and were headed for the nearest record shop.  In the event, I was in very safe hands. He was charming and I think even more nervous than I! I'd changed the venue at the last minute - I didn't fancy waddling around a nature reserve in Shantung silk mules, plus I didn't relish the thought of 2 giggling teenagers peering at me from behind binoculars - so Lincoln seemed the better option - something for everyone to do. I recalled my earlier foray into this field and was careful not to repeat the mistake of aimlessly wandering and steered us quickly in the direction of a smart bar where we proceeded to sup coffee and while away the afternoon getting to know more about each other. Much better to have eye contact and the chance to use body language - and it seems to have worked - he's online now and still very keen to chat - even talking about meeting again. Phew! So maybe I'm not entirely repulsive to all except the care-in-the-community community.  So all in all a pretty good afternoon. Thanks, Peter - I promise I'll leave the Killer Teenagers at home next time.

      Another bank holiday. This one was meant to be different. I actually had plans. I was going to North Wales to see Jack's grandma and auntie (I do a very good avoidance of his Dad without appearing obvious) but Lisa called the other night and cancelled - uncle's very poorly and they are spending all their time at the hospital in Liverpool. I fully understood and we'll just go over in a few weeks time. I'm left feeling a little disappointed though.  I used to see my annual visit as a duty call- just so Jack would know who his father's family were - and neither of them could blame me for keeping them apart when he grew up. I didn't think we had much in common. I really enjoy going over now. Lisa, Jack's auntie, is lovely. She's a couple of years older than me, and much prettier. She's not well but you'd never know it from looking at her - she just keeps going. Kevin, her partner, is an all-action hero with a fab TVR and June and Arthur, Grandma and Grandad, are salt-of-the-earth types who'd give you their last ha'penny. Stephen's not all bad either, I just don't have call to see him anymore - Jack's big enough to go on his own now - thankfully.  We never do much apart from shop at Cheshire Oaks or wander around Chester. I had intended to spend a fortune this weekend, new clothes, new shoes, all for me for a change. Oh well! I can't seem to be able to get rid of it at the moment - a sure sign my mood has lifted.  Now what should I do? I have a brand new Astra to play with, on hire courtesy of the chap who ran into the back of me, or at least his insurance, whilst my rear end is fixed. I'm dead chuffed not to have a flipping awful Corsa. I've explored various options; Kathryn is busy so I can't go to London to see my sis; Eva is free tonight and will probably come over after she's been to wish her Grandma happy birthday but I can't leave Jack on his own so Leeds is out, Rachel is probably sick of the sight of me,and even Marko, my old faithful fall-back, is working and obviously doesn't want to accommmodate an ex from 6 or 7 years ago and his godson.  That leaves me with internet options. If I was brave enough, I'd go over to Belfast to meet a cheeky rogue who's caught my eye. My hunky rugby player is away on holiday so there won't be any scrummaging there for a few weeks. There are 2 or 3 cute guys in deepest Lincolnshire who I might meet. I'm certain there will be no romance but it's likely to be a lot more fun than cleaning out my kitchen cupboards, or mopping my floor, activities that I do not want to be repeating on yet another bank holiday, when everyone else I know is having a loved-up long weekend.  That's it decided! RSPB Nature Reserve it is! I always want to Hide on dates so it's the perfect choice. He'll recognize me soon enough. I'll be the rare visitor in summer plumage and totally impractical heels.

      It's almost 8pm and I've just finished preparing my completions for tomorrow. I don't like to cut it that fine, there are enough things that can go wrong and cause enough stress for me as it is, without the prospect of having forgotten to request mortgage funds and not a hope in hell of getting them in time for the clients to move. I've never actually done that in over 16 years but there's always a first time, and I seem to be chasing my tail so much just lately that it could strike at any time!  Fingers crossed, they all look reasonably ok -  a couple of estate agents haven't got their bills through to me yet so they may have to wait a few days to get paid - so there are some benefits to being overworked! Cup half full, girl. me!!  My lovely boss and I have interviewed a potential new Personal Assistant for me tonight. I'm not sure whether she'll take the job - she is likely to see it as a step backwards given that she is currently running the show at another firm, albeit by default when the solicitor left and wasn't replaced immediately. She's probably not quite ready to be in the deep end with us big fish yet and is floundering about a bit, a few years under my expert fin and she'd have the makings of a good career - but anyway, we'll see what happens. She's very tall, slim and blonde - and did I mention 21? -but she's got massive feet - canoes for shoes -I like to know I'm better shod than my junior team players. Listen at me - Eva's coaching is beginning to play off - my first instinct was to say "underlings".  I'm off home now, still another 45 minutes drive but the scenery is really pretty and if I'm lucky I may just see the sun setting over the Humber Bridge. I've done really well the last few nights and more or less gone straight to bed when I've got in rather than sitting chatting to interesting cyber-hologram men. I've had a really stressful long day today and know I've got an even worse one coming up tomorrow - normally a trigger to reach for the Shiraz to help me forget about it - but I've got to be up early to take my car to the garage. I'm getting a hire car while it's in the plastic surgery unit. Not sure what but the lovely lad from the hire company promised me something of a higher grade than a bloody awful Corsa or Fiesta! I'll probably get an Astra! Oh well, I can just pretend I'm a Sales rep as I drive across the Pennines tomorrow night! It's got to be better than being a Conveyancer on the last Friday of month before a bank holiday and half-term!!

      One could be forgiven for assuming that my sallies into dating land are starting to pay off, given that I have spent the afternoon in the company of a very lovely member of the opposite sex with a swollen apendage. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth - I have been visiting my scrummy godson who recently underwent a little boy's operation and is now enjoying running around in the sun with the perfect excuse to go commando. He is such a brave little soldier!  It was a really pleasant afternoon, sitting in the garden, soaking up the sun, chatting idly, and then enjoying a delicious salad. Steve was a little anxious that Jack, being 13 and having a masters in computer games, would beat him to the next level of his latest excuse not to finish the 101 DIY jobs that Rachel finds for him the minute he gets home from his busy manual job, but he needn't have worried (Jack confessed in the car on the way home that he'd actually finished that game well over 6 months ago, so he had no need to compete).  I considered stopping off at the cinema on the way home. Jack was unusually willing to venture in with me, I suspect because he knows none of his friends go there on a Sunday evening so he was safe from being spotted unfashionably with his mum. In the event, my excesses of chatting on here over the past 2 nights caught up with me and I opted for the quickest route to the sofa and my paper. I've abandoned that safe haven now, after enduring 5 minutes of Hells Kitchen! I thought TV was supposed to be entertaining! Awful presenter! Awful chefs! Awful vehicle for washed-up sad old has -beens! (Amanda Barrie, you were great as Cleopatra and I really liked Alma - but pleeeeaase!)  I am absolutley not going to be on here for long! Busy weeks starts again in less than 9 hours and I want to be able to hit the phones running! But I might just hop onto my friendly website, just to see who's there and how my newly-posted photo is doing - I'm big on the Continent by all accounts.

      I've done very well this week - only 1 really late night at work!  I haven't exactly been shirking my duties, at least I've been trying to devote some long-overdue time to some of my charitable activities - oh! and having a facial! Wow! Did I need it!?!  I was buffed and rubbed by Anna - delightful, wee thing with mad Bjorkish bunches - I decided against the hi-tech lifting doobrey! My looks may be fading but I'm not ready for that yet! I opted for the deep cleanse instead. It was heaven! I nearly jumped off the table when she started the shoulder massage! But after a minute or so, it was bliss - I particularly enjoyed the ear-rubbing thing she did - it only lasted a few seconds but my ears haven't been touched by human hands (I still controversially use cotton buds) for almost 5 years - you just don't realise what you are missing sometimes!  I've decided that I deserve a bit more pampering - that's rather a radical turn-of-thoughts for one who hasn't really felt worthy of self-attention, let alone that of others, for some considerable time - so I've booked another for next month - and I have absolutely no guilty feelings whatsoever, which again is refreshing.  The calming effect of the massage had beneficial side-effects in addition to that of my complexion - I went to work in a much better mood than I'd left it the night before! Snapping at my secretary over 25p really isn't how I like to run my ship! Well! Honestly! She could see I was up to my neck in it, trying to get everything ready for my 30-odd (some more odd than others) families that I had moving today, and all she could do was hover for 5 minutes to talk to me about a minor (25p) discrepancy on a Completion Statement! Can no-one else ever see the Bigger Picture? I was more concerned that my 3.8million pounds worth of property would move.  Eva has played a minor, potentially disastrous role in my week. I foolishly sent her 2 photos of diametrically opposed men who I've chatting to - both very charming in their own way - to see what she thought.I wrongly assumed, given that she works for a large corporate venture, that she would be reasonably computer literate and that my emails would remain private - and in a way they did - save that her replt that she "preferred the lanky one!" was sent not to me - but to the hunky rugby player! Fortunately, he has a fine sense of humour and a well-developed competitive streak - so she may have done me a favour in the long run - least I now have a potential new salsa partner - our lessons start in 3 weeks. Wonder how many pounds I'll lose by then?

      4 lbs! 4 whole flipping pounds! That's more than twice the size of Tutty's premature young son! In 2 weeks! Olympic dieter, or what? and that's without any effort (throwing myself around Eva's front room in my pyjamas to the strains of Shang-a-Lang doesn't count - although I either pulled a muscle or my sciatic nerve is offended!)  Didn't work out tonight, on account of the offended Gluteus Maximus - but I skipped home - did I say skipped? I meant drove, very slowly 'cos I was so tired from having allowed myself to be chatted at for hours last night on msn - via the car wash - she looks so much better, and now I can see through the windscreen facing the sun, much more reassuring for me and other road-users - does that make me eligible for a discount on my insurance do you think?  At this rate I'll be raiding Eva's wardrobe again by September! Or I might just treat myself to a whole new one! and it will not be from George!

      I decided at 3.30pm today that I would resign from my Charity position - I had not even started to look at Friday's post, let alone today's and my in-tray was higher than my washing pile at home! Something had to give and my charitable indulgences seemed the obvious choice! I rang the new Chair-in-Waiting and told her I would be taking a few months sabbatical - I meant it! I came off the phone all proud of myself at having finally said "no!" - not an expression I've used often as a 30-something single mum!  I went to rescue my carat 6.30pm from the multi-storey with every intention of going back to the office but the further away I got from it the more I decided the work would still be there tomorrow - so I started to drive home and before I knew it I was in the car park of the Baptist Church - venue for the AGM! Well, I had invited the speaker, would be rude not to show my face!  I'm pleased I did - the proceedings started perfunctorily - I found myself agreeing to remain as Publicity Officer! (joke! - I write the odd editorial for the paper and run a Ball or 2!) I could have kicked myself after all my brave words on the phone about being too busy but then I never could say no!!  But my speaker! What a delight!! A localish-ish Funeral Director! Not your normal choice of bon vivant, but an absolute pearl!  Funny, compelling, witty, discreet, compassionate,and extremely respectful to the objects of his dialogue (and dialogue it was with audience participation encouraged)! He has a book out in a couple of weeks - " Yours,Eventually", 120 stories randomly collected over 30 years as a funeral director - if his delivery of half a dozen of those anecdotes tonight are anything to go by, he will have you in raptures and tears for the small price of £6.99!! Mark Tyack!! He'll be big - you saw it here first!

      Well that was a pleasnt weekend. Eva & I tried out the new Bibi's venue in Leeds last night - 30's decor - allegedly £3million - well spent but not that convincing - we would have both preferred to see Eurovision on the widescreens than Robbie Williams, but the clientele more than made up for the lack of tack on the silver screen - no Emmerdale stars easily spotted, but lots of wanna-bes and hairdressers!  Talking of which, my hairdresser horribilis was sitting right next to us! He was hired by my former coiffeuer d'amour in Harrogate when the deliectable Adam had to take a break from cutting. The new guy had good credentials, ex-West Row, but dire client-flattery skills! He earnt himself a listing on my people-not-to-wish-well-to list when his answer to my recently-dumped needs for ego-boosting hair-do's was that he was a hairdresser, not a miracle worker! I'd driven 80 miles (ok, so Scunthorpe to Harrogate is probably further than you'd normally go to a hairdresser - but Adam was worth it!), was prepared to spend a weeks salary on my crowning glory - and he made me feel like a bit part in a low-budget soap!  We watched him negotiate his ostentacious Lobster Thermidor(he didn't have a clue how to eat it) whilst his pretty Date picked at her prawns - then we left hoping they had been too consumed with themselves to hear our commentary on their body language.  Eva was reasonably well-behaved, given that she'd wielded a carving knife at me earlier, purportedly in jest, but I know how bad her hand-eye co-ordination is- I was genuinely disturbed! and all because I couldn't get the cork out of the Champagne bottle! She fell getting out of the taxi - she does live on a very steep incline which is not high-heel friendly - but then she wasn't wearing killer heels and had drunk the lion's share of the wine! I laughed - she tried to karate kick me - but the wounds( deep, very bloody) meant she only managed to hit my shin, which is now sporting a lovely puce bruise. Her knee looks much more impressive and will surely earn her lots of sympathy from her celebrity boyfriend when he flies back from the Emirates tonight.  Today was spent in sleepy Snaith at Alistair's 3rd birthday party. The sun was shining on him and all the grown-up guests his parents had invited - family mainly. Eva amazed everyone with her ability to remain in the same room as a toddler for more than 5 minutes without tears(both of them appeared remarkably relaxed and comfortable with one another - anyone who knows her will know that is worthy of comment)and I cruised his big brother's housemate from behind my dark glasses - very tasty but a tad too young.  They're into Civil War re-enactment. Debbie could easily talk me into a serviing-wench's outfit - and apparently I get my pick of the Officers! I've booked a weekend at Oakwell Hall in my diary for July and I'm practising my Cornish accent - seems so much more appropriate than Lincolnshire High Speech!

      I wasn't exactly skiving off early tonight - I mean, ok, so I went to the hairdressers at 5 o'clock but he is a client so it was just like I was still working reeaaallyy! Albeit whilst having my roots done and a few blonde highlights dotted here and there (and he did it for free on account of that fact that I was still working!!!)   He's lovely, my hairdresser - Danny - handsome, funny and unstereotypically straight - what's more he's newly single and gets changed into his football strip to blow-dry my hair! And I don't even have to pay him to do it, he's just getting ready to go straight to his 6-a-side game as soon as he's finished de-HattieJacquesing me - when one of his mates or his equally dishy (and also remarkably unhomosexual) brother are there too, passing the masking papers or holding the ceramic straighteners, I can think of nowhere better than to relax from the rigours of a stressful week. Bliss in a bottle!  There'll be more about Danny over the next few months - very hush! hush! But I'm quite excited about it - professionally of course.  Tonight is the first time in almost a month that I've left the office before 8. I'm on nodding terms with the homeless guy who sleeps in next door's entrance - good job he hasn't got a lap-top or I'd probably be considering accepting a date from him! I've been spending so long at my desk, I'm due a company catheter by June! I'm really not complaining - I love the job and I am very aware that it is not expected, or wished of me, but being a new job, I'm all eager and anxious to make a name for myself. The downside is that where I am usually prolific enough during normal hours to keep 2 full-time secretaries and an assistant busy, doing all this extra means that I ideally need a small army to get through the work I am producing - so it's self-perpetuating, the more I do, the more there is to do, the more I fell I must do!   It's working wonders for my weight-loss! I finally managed to find 2 minutes to heat up a tub of soup at 4.15 tonight - I literally had chance to take 4 mouthfuls inbetween answering the phone and signing letters before I had to dash out ( 15 minutes late, but then when am I ever on time) for my Danny Date. So really it's a win-win situation - the clients are happy to be moving, I'm loving the feedback from the agents, and I'm rebabeing all at the same time! Must confess the first 2 are coming quicker than the last but Rome wasn't built in a day - and nor were my fat reserves!  I rang Eva from the office last night, apparently she's being trying to contact me for a couple of weeks but didn't want to leave a message on my musical answerphone. We are seriously considering hitting Leeds this weekend - her new, pleasingly unusual boyfriend is away working (in Dubai, comedy, can't imagine what his stand-up routine will go like - no I don't even want to try!) so we are toying with the idea of getting the girls together and spending some long overdue quality time with one another. Mind you, if it's anything like the other week, we'll get too pissed on champagne to bother to get ready and end up dancing around her living room to Bay City Rollers, with a bit of Dolly, Madonna and Kylie thrown in, culminating in me emoting wildly to Neil(God)Diamond. My kind of night!  But tonight I will be mostly wearing my dressing-gown in the vicinity of the sofa, watching TV (until my brain goes numb) and wishing that fantastically rejuvenating head massage had been more global.

      I'm really pleased I did as I was told for once and stayed away from the office all weekend. The piles of files were still here when I walked in this morning but they didn't look half so threatening and imposing as they had at the end of a very tiring week. I've whipped through them today, well that was once I'd seen 9 sets of clients, responded to about 50 emails and answered a constantly ringing phone. I had only managed to dictate 3.8 minutes-worth of work by 4.30pm, then I had to rapidly sign my post before getting my last clients of the day in to sign their contracts. They were a really young couple buying their first house - they were so excited - wonder whether I'll be acting for them in 2 or 3 years time when they are moving onto their next house, perhaps one with a bigger garden and nursery for the children? or going their seperate ways as more often seems to happen.  The rest from work has definitely done me good, but it nearly got me into deeper water than I had intended. After the experience with Hann the Mann last week I had firmly decided not to even think about meeting anyone else until I was feeling more confident, slimmer and had my roots done. Easy for most people, easy for me too I thought! But since when did I do anything easy! I forgot to factor in the effects of marinading myself in a few bottles of wine over the weekend, culminating in me suggesting to a witty young man from Derbyshire that we go on a mini-cruise to Holland for our first date! It seemed like such a great idea at the time! I've never been on the Hull ferry even though I see it everday on my way to work and he seemed such a nice young man.  Fortunately, he appears to be quite a sensible, mature gentleman, despite being a mere 30 years old (Gosh! Eva would be so proud), and recognized that perhaps I had allowed the wine to cloud my judgement so he didn't go straight to the P&O website and book a 2 for 1 as I had insisted he do! I think  perhaps it would be wiser to meet for a drink and chat first, before co-ordinating our holiday plans, just not sure when given the state of my diary over the next few weeks and my inability ot leave the office much before 8pm (it's 19.47 now technically I've finished work, not doing any more tonight - just taking advantage of the peace and quiet and lack of friendly msn interruptions!) At least this time he's seen what I look like, a further side-effect of the alcohol-consumption being my lack of inhibition in using my webcam (I stayed clothed, Eva! Even wine can't stop me being hopelessly shy about my body), and he's still wanting to talk to me which is a positive sign.  I'll have to go and see the Cheese Nazi tomorrow and let her scales decide the verdict - loss of 4lb or more I'll agree a date, anything less than that and he'll have to wait! (If you are reading this I have never lost more than 3 lbs in a week so far, so don't warm the car up!)

      Blissful day! Slept 'til about 11 having spent far too long talking to a would-be accountant from the North West and a very unusual Irish giant - it was mad - my son would have been shocked - I certainly was! Anyway, I lay in bed for the entire Jonathan Ross programme reading - not my new novel but a foodie magazine, got all inspired and headed for my temple, St Tesco, as soon as I'd deloused myself in the bathroom. I see everyone in there(Tesco - not my bathroom, it's big but not that accommodating) so it took some time to get around - then I had to head for the rugby club to drop off the Player of The Year shield which CM has to pass on to this year's Superstar of the Park! His old, sadly-missed coach was there propping up the bar - I think he had a soft spot for me as he used to play against, and compete in the after-game bar with my dad. I recieved a very warm reception and some mighty fine compliments. I would have quite happily drawn up a stool and passed a pleasant afternoon with him but I had to pick CM up from some roadside close to where he and his mates had been climbing trees - every time I worry about how fast he is growing up he goes and does something charmingly juvenile and lulls me into a false sense of security about my ability to get through my thirties grandchild-free!  I picked up a DVD on the way home and have just spent the last few hours with Helen, Julie and the rest of the Calendar Girls - loved it! But why does someone else always beat me to these fabulous ideas! First Helen Flipping Fielding and now a bunch of ageing, greying women from a sleepy North Yorkshire backwater with better figures and more spirit than me! Unfair! But then again, all the ideas I have would probably land me in a Libel trial, so maybe fate is kind!  I've decided I am going to try and write - but my printer has different ideas and won't let me see the start of the BBC's books - will have to hope the office manager is too busy to notice me downloading partly-formed manuscripts from a non-legal website next week! Aaaarggghhh! Now I'm thinking about work! Somebody inject me with Gin - quick!!

      I did it! I pulled the rabbit out of the hat - again! God! I'm proud of myself sometimes. I managed to complete the nasty old down-in-the-mouth dentist's sale so he could move into his new hutch with his buck-toothed wife - I did it for my own client and the other lawyers in the chain - part of me was really quite annoyed that such a horrid bully boy got his way but then I'm a better, more charitable person than him, and the gratitude it afforded me from my colleagues and the agents was worth it. My lovely new boss even gave me a bottle of champagne as a reward for my stupendous efforts and forbade me from going anywhere near the office this weekend - much different to my old boss who would have taken the credit for it himself somehow - and then promptly asked me to spend my leisure time writing some banal report for one of his many pointless meetings.   I'll give you an example of what he was like - there was one night last winter when I was staying late trying to get some urgent things on tape. It had been snowing all day and there was no sign of it letting up. My old Scroogey boss popped back into the office, probably to ring a girlfriend or pull himself off in the boardroom and was most concerned to see me still slaving away at 8pm with the prospect of a 30 mile journey home along country roads. He was clearly worried I might not make it in the car (or indeed back again the next morning) so he kindly informed me that he had no problem with me......booking into a hotel? staying the night in the guest room given that he has a huge 5 bedroom house and there's only him and his adorable long-suffering wife left at home? go home straight away before the weather worsened? No!!! It was quite acceptable for me to put some of the chairs together and sleep in one of the backrooms! I could hardly believe what I was hearing!! And to think I stuck it out for 7 years!   So now the weekend is upon me again - I cleaned the house last week so I can't do that again for a good few months! CM is staying at his mate's so I'll pray they stay up in his room surfing for porn or something rather than getting themselves arrested! Saw most of my friends last week and I haven't done anything since deserving of an anecdote to amuse and entertain them. Can't think of anything I want to buy - (Christ! My depression must be lifting! never thought I'd hear myself saying that!)My ex, my safety blanket when I'm terminally bored, is working away so won't be around to play with me. So I'll just have to sleep late, lay in bed even later reading the new novel recommended to me or finishing the last one, and generally slob out - no phones, no demanding clients, no pushy pseudo-lovers! Singledom has its advantages!

      Horrible day! Yuk! Yuk! Started badly - didn't get out of the wrong side of bed, just got out too late! Thank goodness my secretary is trained to give me a wake up call when I don't appear within half an hour of my ETA!  I finally did battle with the dreaded Sasser worm last night and had a bit of a cyber fest into the bargain - well it was his birthday! and he is very cute! Anyway, the birds were up before I was even tucked up - must remember not to do that on a school night again! But it was fun.  Culminated in some awful bully of a client - someone else's, not my own - calling me to tell me how dreadful I am and that if he can't move tomorrow he is blaming me personally and expects me to pick up his hotel bill if he can't move into his new des res at the exact time of his choosing! I was incredibly calm, polite and expect a nomination for Customer Service of the Year award! I apologised that I had been unable to see my client ( his buyer) at the precise time that he had been available to come and see me, and tried to explain that my diary had been solidly booked - being a Dentist he might have understood! - I had seen him at the first available opportunity this week - 10.30 Tuesday - and promptly dispatched my final searches and cheque requests - the fact that a leading High Street lender cannot guarantee my client's mortgage money will be with me tomorrow is a result of the crazy state of the market - not my fault, nor is the fact that the undoubtedly-clever-and-talented bully of a Dentist has booked his van despite advice to the contrary from his own solicitor! He nearly got to me, just 'cos I was so tired - my instinct was to scream, rant, rave and cry - all at the same time - but I took a leaf out of Eva's book and she would have been so proud of me! My secretary hugged me afterwards, and the Law Grad who I'm training at the moment has started looking at me in awe - my boss promptly cancelled his registration with this guy's practice and supported me 100% ( he is so lush, my new boss!)   I'm over it now - and infinitely proud of my power to not cry when all I wanted to do was curl up in a ball under my desk and sob for England!  Tonight, Matthew (Peter, David, and Dean), I'm going to be Ali McBeal - but without the fab clothes, protruding neck bones, phantom babies and boyfriends!  Thank fuck tomorrow is Friday!

      Work is crazy this week. I thought it was manic last week but all the people I couldn't speak to then now need me urgently - it can be nice to feel wanted but this is just daft. I'm taking advantage for a few minutes to write some drivel though, 'cos I can't get online at home - a chap from btopenworld thinks I might have been struck by this awful worm that is doing the rounds! The cyber version of genital warts! Yukk!! I'll try his gynaecyberlogical cure when I eventually get home tonight - hope it's earlier than my 10.30pm finish last night!  The ups and downs of the weekend are but a distant memory - my head is full of deadlines, restrictive covenants and the sound of phones ringing - someone even called my directline at 9pm last night! And were not surprised when I answered it! I really must pencil in time to get a life in my diary!  I've just seen Ian, the car park guy. He was relieved to see I'd survived the blind date. He made some very flattering comments, I think he's always had a soft spot for me, but then I was 25 and a size 10 when he first met me, and he does spend his working day in the basement of a multi-storey car park - think the lack of sunlight might have affected his eyesight - look what it did to Gollum!  Being offline seems to be having a surprisingly beneficial effect too - some of the chaps I might normally have chatted to are sending me very sweet e-mails, mind you they haven't met me yet! I do have a great face and figure for remote communication.  Anyway, I can't put off this pile of files which is threatening to collapse onto me any longer - nose back to the grindstone....

      I finally did it! Got off the sofa, threw on some clothes (not my first choice but they were in the wash) and went to meet a man! A proper, real, living, breathing man!   I was really nervous - much more so than before an exam - I sail through those and the examiner never cares how huge your arse is! I spent ages faffing about and running backwards and forwards to the loo - CM was getting really frustrated 'cos he wanted dropping off at his mates, and I couldn't tell him where I was going! After I'd looked in the mirror for the 20th time he finally screamed "For Goodness sake, you look beautiful and you're only going to the flipping office!"    We'd arranged to meet at a tourist attraction close to my office.  I parked the car in my usual spot and had a quick chat with Ian, the car park attendant, just in case the police needed to piece together a re-enactment for Crimewatch if the softly spoken Scot I'd chatted to on the phone turned out to be Hannibal Lect(ur)er.    I walked over the newly opened footbridge, audibly convincing myself to calm down, take a breath and get a grip.  What was the worst that could happen?  Well, I suppose he could enjoy the Chianti without sharing it!  I spotted him fairly quickly, his back was turned to me, but I recognised the purple shirt - not too many of those around in Hull - and the salt with a sprinkling of pepper hair.  I think he spotted me pretty quickly too.  I could feel myself blushing from my toes.  How I managed to walk down those steps without my legs, which had turned to blancmange, giving way, I do not know.    Anyway, a very ambulatory afternoon ensued - there were no thunderbolts and I was quite relieved that he didn't dive straight into the Humber!  I couldn't think of a single witty thing to say, so I didn't - I was more concerned with the fact that my new Spring collection cotton skirt was rapidly riding up my thighs on my tights.  The actuality of meeting a man was not as daunting as I had imagined but that probably had more to do with him being polite and not fancying me in the slightest.  Meant that my jiggly bits were in no imminent threat of discovery.    Went home feeling quite calm and relieved but my PC wasn't playing, all my friends were, but with other people, so I naturally had a glass of  wine, and another, and before I knew it I was breaking the rules and texting - not my proudest hour - and that is why, my friends, I promise to you that when elected I will introduce compulsory breathalysers on all technological equipment!

      You would think, given that I only live next door, my mother would have been able to give me a little advance notice that my new patio door was being fitted today - it's not a lot to ask, surely. But no - the first I heard of it was when Jack came in my bedroom at 7.15 this morning demanding the key.  I had to fly around the house with the Dyson, picking up half a rainforest of Sunday paper, empty wine bottles, clothing etc. I haven't done anything all weekend and the place was a tip. I've just shut the kitchen door and hoped the glaziers don't get thirsty or need the loo - they would have to battle through half-emptied weekend bags, shopping bags ( I found a fantastic underwear sale yesterday, it was a bit extravagant of me, especially as I don't get paid until tomorrow, but a girl can never have enough foundation garments, and corsets are definitely a fashion direction that suits my Jessica Rabbit-prone figure) and shoes to get to my en-suite, and then I dread to think what they might find.  I had hoped to be going home to new French doors, but the miserable Loss Adjuster would only cough up for one replacement panel - still it will be nice to have the scent of the garden wafting in of an evening - shame it also allows Darius to bring in ever larger mammals - many a night has been spent chasing him and a mole/baby rabbit/albatross around the lounge - which reminds me - I must pick up cat food on the way home.

      My week started well. Up on time, good tunes from Wogan, sunshine, a dividend cheque and a smile on my face from my chat with The Throb last night. Could it possibly get any better?  F*** me, yes! I had a huge pile of post in my pigeon-hole - always makes me feel good, sign that my insecurity still lingers. It took me nearly an hour to get it all asigned to the right files, what with all the calls and the need to use the new toaster. But the day went off well - all mail  answered, and even a few files from the pending pile dealt with - and then at a very punctual 4pm, I got an email from that sexy solicitor - I just know he waits til his post is signed and then sends me a note.  I had thought about not replying, but I've never been cool and a few short emails later, and we are chatting, and chatting, and chatting - 2 unanswered calls to Jack and an hour and a half later, I leave work, move my car and meet the girls I should have seen at 5.30, who have by then eaten, for a coke and a fulldown on life chez Chez!  It wasn't all Me! Me! - but it could have been - I am so brimming with enthusiasm right now - and I suspect from where they were sitting it was.  I will make it up to them in Knicker Exchange!

      I was reeeeaaaallllly dancing last night. I do love a good boogie, especially with a handsome man to swoop and twirl me about - and there was no shortage of them lining up to mark my card. The best was Jim The Gardener, mainly because it was the first time I'd met him (and his lovely wife) and I get a thrill out of being able to follow a new lead. But I can't forget Tomlinson, take a pinch of music, a large dash of wine and it's not long before we are cooking up a party of our own.  He is such a cheeky rogue and it's always a bit dangerous - I'm currently sporting the bruises to prove it!  Vickie must have been right when she told me over coffee yesterday afternoon that I had "F*** me" tattooed all over my forehead. I'll spare you the gory details, but let's just say I've definitely found my form and can count myself a hardened hedonist once again.  So today has been spent very lazily. Fortunately, no hangover appeared - largely soothed by the lyrical sound of Irish burr down the phone at lunchtime. Now there's someone I could do the horizontal tango with! and a bit of Throbbing never did anyone any harm.

      It's my First Knickers Day!!!! The anticipation has been immense - what would they be like? who would they be from? was I wrong in ruling out dental-floss-esque styles?(anyone that knows me will be siding with my better instinct on that!)  So - white, lacy, hipster midi, French styley! Very nice actually - and as I haven't done any washing this week - arrived just in the Knick(!) of time! from Julie in Gloucestershire - I have a sneaking suspicion she might be a friend of my cousin Jennie - the lazy buggers in Hull haven't done it yet!  Gosh! I bet you are wondering what on earth I'm going on about! I know discussing my underwear is a bit extreme even for me. I've taken part in a Knicker Exchange. I was a little taken aback when I got the letter - very much like a chain letter - in fact, it IS a chain letter - but as it was from Lisa, who in turn had received it from Ali, I could hardly refuse - and it's hardly onerous.  All you had to do was send a pair of brand-new-label-still-attached-no-trying-them-on-or-letting-your-boyfriend pants to the persons name at the bottom of the letter. I sent Ali a sexy black and pink thong thingy - I think John would have liked it too. Then just send on the letter to 6 friends, with the instruction to do likewise.  Eva refused - think she was a bit embarrassed that she might not have so many friends - either that or she doesn't wear knickers when Roger is around and doesn't want to run the risk of him finding out that she does wear them normally - and will always be in large, tummy-hugging stretchy nylon numbers as soon as ever they are married. Better just not to open the topic!  I think everyone else is game! Kathryn was so keen, she sent out at least a dozen letters - I can't wait to get the knickers from her friends - they are bound to be posh!   I'm going to go and try on Julie's gift now. I'll keep you updated on how many and what type I get.

      I've missed my secretary -she's been poorly sick for 3 days now - I've just had Ling to do my bidding - and she did great for the first 2 days - but today! I gave her my completions to do - only 10 today and all purchases (bar one which was a very straightforward sale) - they were all t'd up and couldn't have been an easier day to start - she did well - but she thought she did outstandingly well - she was smugger than ever this afternoon, and kept bustling into my office every 5 flipping minutes - I shut my door for a reason, being "I'm busy - I vant to be alone" - Jacquie knows that instinctively - Ling obviously sees it as a challenge - or an invitation to irritate me as much as possible - she was outstanding at that!  So, tonight I was home just after 8pm - had a good long chat with Eva - God! she gave me some great material for my book - then Jack came home and went online - I fell asleep - only just woken up (3.45am) - and I've missed the Throb - means I've got to wait til Sunday at the earliest now - and I'll need an early, pre-school night then! Bugger!  But I did have some fun with that cute solicitor before I left work - dinner is now just a few emails away - I can feel it!  Oh! and I went shopping in an extended lunch hour - get me! having a break on a Friday!! I could get used to Ling after all! - tried on loads of tops in the sales - and the only ones that fitted were 14s!!! and then some were a bit baggy! Didn't find the perfect corset-style top I was after, but got a very acceptable scoop neck chiffon number which will look great with my new leather skirt tomorrow night.  And given that the Throb is clearly sleeping, Imight even manage to be eye-bag-free for this party - so all in all, I'm reeeeeeeaaaallllllly looking forward to this party tomorrow!

      My uber-efforts at work are paying off - down to my last large pile of files to work on - but it has more to do with the fact that the strain has finally taken it's toll on my secretary, who is currently nursing a nasty rash, enlarged glands, and a puffy face - I've told her to stay at home as long as it takes - I already have a propensity to all those traits and don't need any added assistance from my assistant.  It made me feel much better about skiving off at 6.30 to pick Jack up for the pre-season training pre-training meeting at the rugby club. I was dreading it, if truth be told - new coaches, likely to be much the same as the previous bunch, taken one too many punches in the scrum, unable to wear the trousers at home, and not clever enough to know what to do with a little bit of power -parents, some of them very vociferous and inarticulate, others just subversively grumbling between themselves, a couple just anxious to get as much cheap ale down their necks as possible, and me just sitting smilimg, staying schtum (apart from the odd bitchy comment which I knew few would understand, only the ones who are on my wavelength) and taking it all in.  I wasn't that disappointed - the Chief Coach could at least string a sentence together, but it was quite self-indulgent - I took notice of the bit about being fined 50p for being late - that'll put an end to my all-night chat sessions next weekend - Jack took absolutely no notice whatsoever of the bit about turning up in clean boots, suspect that'll be down to me still - and yes - the parents were already finding things to moan about. Their points might be valid - certainly in the case of the self-appointed fundraiser - don't know what it is about her but she rubs me up the wrong way - not that I'd want her to know,I can imagine she takes no prisoners in a fight - but give it a chance I say - season doesn't start 'til September (and if I keep losing weight at this rate, I'll be in a 12, and the only mum on the touchline in a mini skirt and crop-top, ditch those baggy jumpers, Cherrypie!) and the boys need to get fit, together and focussed on an enjoyable, competitive season of tough rugger. The boys are looking great - some of them a bit spotty, but they are growing so much - can't believe they were only 9 when I first met most of them - seems like last week - and now shaving!!!  I'll miss the first training session on sunday morning - party saturday - don't expect to have stopped partying by that time - but I am looking forward to meeting up with the parents again - they are mostly lovely people, sport-politics aside, and we do have a laugh on a day when I would otherwise be mouldering in bed.  Oh! and the other interesting thing that happened today? That cute solicitor - he dropped me an email on what I think was a very lame pretext of wanting to copy one of my drafts - we plagiarise all the time in our game, so he needn't have asked - and what's more, I'd only cribbed from his contract, but with the odd Cherrypie device, but it did earn me an offer of alcohol - just hope it comes with dinner!

      I picked one of the best ever matches to miss by all accounts. I'm sure it didn't compare to the exciting time I had checking through a particularly cheeky Lease, complete with a stunning Flying Freehold, a remarkable Chancel Repair problem, and a bit of adverse possession! Now you occasionally see a couple of these at once - but 4 altogether! Fantastic!!   It just kept getting better when I got home too. There were quite a few of my regular e-chatterers online - the beer and high-spirits must have got them in a friendly mood 'cos they all wanted to chat. I had to take it in turns to chat to them, trying to juggle each so as not to spend an unfairly long time with one, to the exclusion of the others.  The Strawberry Date Dish was on his new webcam as well - very brave of him - I of course, was very very sober (it being a school night, and having to be  aprofessional interviewer this morning) and therefore probably disappointed him by just sitting smiling, occasionally flicking my hair about and generally looking a bit daft and self-conscious.  The Dynamo was back from his holiday and had managed to edit all his holiday snaps so I was then treated to a slide show of various parts of European coast.  Just as I was about to go to bed, the Throb came online - he does it every flipping night - impeccable timing - always as I'm about to log off and get some kip - and yes, I know I could still do that, but there's just something about him - maybe it's that I know my mother wouldn't approve - I know I shouldn't approve! - maybe it's 'cos he's a bit different - exotic even - if you can call Northern Ireland that! I'm going to have to meet him sooner or later 'cos I'm starting to do what I've seen others do with me - and that's start to imagine it's real almost - I need to be brought right back down to reality! and I will be, I'm sure of it. Anyway, too busy for the next couple of months so it's not an option.  PS. I was asked what a scent library was - see my answer to the comment below - honestly! I would have expected a more discerning readership! but I'm flattered I have any beyond Eva and Rachel - and that's only cos they can never get through on my phoneline anymore - just like to check I'm still ok - not lying unconscious somewhere, being feasted on by my hungry cat - while the rest of the world fails to notice I'm missing.

      I must be the only person not watching the England-Croatia match judging by the groans and cheers I can hear from the pubs outside the office - and they are all quite a way off so I dread to think what is happening out there. I was keeping up with it on Yahoo Sport! but it froze at 43 minutes - I think we've just gone into the second half having equalized. It sounds like I'm missing an exciting match -typical!  But then how many people will turn up for work tomorrow having polished off 4 client reports with 6 full tapes for their secretaries to get cracking on. I'm interviewing tomorrow so I need to make sure I'm on the ball (no pun intended, see above). I hope England take the lead, my lovely new boss might show his darker side if not, and I wouldn't wish that on the poor interviewee.  Right! It's 9pm - I want to get out of the office and back to the car before the ugly Northern yobs pour out of the pubs, braying for blood. and more importantly bafore my friendly little off-licence man shuts!

      Why do the weekends go so quickly? and why do I never seem to achieve any of the things I plan to do? I just about manage to do the washing, give the place a very very quick once over, and then it's Sunday night again and I have to think about getting up early.  I love long lay-ins at a weekend - would be better if I had the Sunday paper delivered, and a handsome man to bring it to me along with a cup of coffee - he could read the Sport pages, and help me with the Crossword (but only if I asked him - I wouldn't want him starting it before me), and then insist I had another cosy slumber while he got on with the lunch preparations! Aaaahhh! To dream.  I did at least get over to see Dad this afternoon. He seemed thoroughly underwhelmed with his posh Penhaligons scent library, but little Emily was thrilled with her Beauty Box that I'd bought her as a special treat from her big sis. I was dying to get her to open it and try on the glitter gel and hair mascara but her mum had other ideas and told her to keep it for when she next had a party to go to - spoil sport.  I never did the usual girlie stuff as a kid - I always had my head in books - or wanted to play on the rope swing with the boys in the wood opposite, until the local farmer recognized me as one of the kids playing Chicken - swinging out just as he came down the hill, he told my Dad and that was an end to that for the summer - we had to decamp to the local river and swim off the slipway - until the local eel-farmer recognized me as one of the kids riding a bike off the jetty just as he was coming down stream...............  Kathryn was always the girlie one - she had a huge Sindy house - ex-display from the local toy shop - every single item of furniture and accessory then available - she used to get really cross when I snuck in and put Action man in very compromising poses with her dolls - funny - she never picked up any of my books, and she always hated playing Scrabble with me.  Emily's a bit of a girlie girl too - so I bought her some stilts for her birthday this year - boys toys were always much more fun - somethings we never grow out of!

      I should have the mother of all hangovers today, as I was still chatting on the phone 'til a ridiculous hour. I was probably talking jibberish too. I smashed one of my favourite glasses - only 1 left now- I shall treat it carefully.Wonder I got up in time for this athletics thingy today. Jack told me it was 12.30 so I rushed about like a mad woman - got half way to York and realised it was still only 10.30 - the little sod had tricked me - so we pulled into Safeways at Willerby and had a big breakfast - nothing like it to set you on your way for the day./  Jack came 5th out of 8 - not bad given that he was a good 2 years younger than most of the other combatants. He enjoyed it too - much less nervous than last week. But he has a really swollen chin from his fight last night - looks like a lop-sided hamster. He's really embarrassed about it. It's just so typical of him - his form teacher had taken my mum on one side yesterday to have a quiet word about Jack - not a grumble this time - apparently he's a dream to teach at the moment and long may it continue - then he goes and does something stupid like fall out with the lad down the road. Kids!!! and me so young!! No wonder I have grey hair!!  Talking of which, Super Danny is putting some more blonde in on Thursday - move over Debbie Harry - Cheryl has entered the arena!

      Martin rescued me from another late Friday in the office with a very well-timed call inviting me to the pub! I was happy to accept - I've not seen much of Martin since I started my fab new job and he makes me feel a little guilty about it - but then I did introduce him to Sophie, and I hope they both remember that in a few years time when they are choosing Godparents for their first born.  I had to let him buy my Diet Coke 'cos I'd left my purse strewn across my lounge floor along with most of the contents of my handbag, having left hastily this morning - v late for work and cussing a handsome tall Irish cutey who manages to get me into trouble despite being hundreds of miles away and my firm resolve to go to bed no matter how funny or appealing his messages might be! I really must learn to get some more will-power!  I collapsed on the sofa when I got in just after 7 - I managed to grab a few winks before the phone rang and disturbed my slumber - it was Jack- he'd fallen out with his friend and needed picking up. Normally by that time on a Friday I'd have poured the best part of a bottle of wine down my neck and would have had to send him home in a taxi - but having slept, the wine was slowly reaching room temperature and I was still alcohol-free - apart, of course from the remains of last night's excess still seeping out my pores. So I obliged, thinking he would be waiting meekly on his own near Kwik-Fit. How wrong was I!!  There was a mob - not kidding - with Jack in front - I drove around the roundabout and pulled up on the brow of the hill, expecting him just to get in and maybe give Torven a lift home too. I wasn't expecting a brawl to erupt over my bonnet and Torven to start thumping ten bells out of Jack - and then kick my car!!! He's so blonde and quiet - and Jack was not retaliating in any way - not that I imagine he was entirely blameless - but he's twice the size of Torven Cosmo! and is very aware of the damage he can do - he was ever so upset on the way home - crying, apologising - it all started over a daft bobble hat - see they are just still kids even if they are starting to feel a bit more grown up and don't know what to do with their testosterone.  Anyway, he's gone to bed after a bath and a cuddle with his mum - he's got a big athletics meeting tomorrow - and then he's hoping I'll take him to the Designer Outlet near York on the way home but I'm hoping it gets too late - I like having money left at the end of the month instead of the other way around. But I also like having a very lovely son, who really is maturing incredibly well - and just the best company ever - shame his friends are not all quite at the same state of development yet - glad I'm not a teenager anymore - just behaving like one!!

      La la la! La la la! La la la! la la la! la la! England!! Wow! What a performance!  I watched it via my Yahoo! Sport online commentary and then listened to it in the car on the way home. I didn't dare watch it live, having turned on the match in the 98th minute on Sunday and given it the kiss of death! And my reticence was rewarded - perhaps tomorrow is a day to braoch the company car issue, given the good mood my Lovely New Boss will be in!  I've had invites to 2 posh parties today as well - one after the other - result! Just got the details for Jack's County Athletics meeting too - if he does well at this, he goes through to the All England Schools' Tournament - he's more interested in going to the Designer Outlet on the way home to buy some new rugby boots and deprive me of more cash - but I've agreed, what price future fame! Move over Jackie Stallone - Cheryl's entered the zone!  I can't get this horny feeling out of my head either - not eased by the fact that my favourite rugby player is back from holiday and emailing me again - and my Mister Sunday is being very attentive - Come on England!!

      My pleas have finally been heard by our super-efficient Office Manager - I now have a large oscillating fan keeping me cool. My request for a sun-bronzed bare-chested handsome mute with an ostrich feather fan standing behind me drip feeding me grapes was ignored but you can't have everything.  It's not arrived a minute too soon either, having spent most of the afternoon playing ever cheekier and flirtier email tennis with a cute, and I suspect newly-single, solicitor who I used to deal with a lot when I worked in my home town. Our paths have crossed for the first time in over 8 years on a friend's house purchase - it's so much more fun when you can inject some humour into what could otherwise become a dull legal process.   There are some boring old farts in this game - too stuffy and far too serious to be taken seriously - thankfully, they are a bit of a dying breed - even solicitors have to recognise that they are performing a public, client-centred service - not doing the public a favour by allowing themselves to be instructed and paid handsomely for it. The only ones that tend to get paid anything like a decent return now are estate agents!  Mind you, most of the agents I deal with regularly are really helpful, like Sarah, bless her, who spent all afternoon phoning removal companies to find a van for one of her sellers for tomorrow, just so my clients, who were further down the chain could move the day before they go away after a very stressful 3 month delay. It worked - contracts were exchanged by 3.30pm - client is delighted  - so much so he offered to take me on holiday with him at the weekend - if only I'd managed to find an assistant who I can rely on to cover for me, I might just have taken him up on it - I've got to know he and his wife quite well from our daily chats and emails.It won't see the same next week!  Oh well! What I can be sure of, is that there will soon be another to take his place!

      It looks like I'm going to have to go over to Leeds mid-week if I have any hope of seeing The Ring this side of autumn. Eva's following Roger around the country every weekend. She promises she won't be the type of girl who never makes time for her friends once they get a boyfriend - and I do think she means it - just not yet.  No doubt she'll be moving to Sheffield soon - that's ok - I don't mind going out there - although I do prefer Leeds - but as Roger quite rightly pointed out, we do invariably sit in Eva's lounge and get pissed so we could do that in any city. Guess we'll have to play Trivial Pursuit more too 'cos we will only need to go through half the "why haven't I got a boyfriend" conversation.  Right! I'm off to the Scales of Terror - wish me luck!

      I am The Last Single Person in Cheryl's World. Eva is officially engaged - ring, the works!  It's all been a bit quick,but I'm not surprised and I'm utterly thrilled for her - except she's talking about having the kind of wedding where no guests are invited! I always expected that of her - and I do respect it  - but I assumed there'd be an exception for me - I've picked evil black spines out of her feet on the first day of our holiday,for goodness sake! You would have thought that would count for something!  Anyway, I am quite looking forward to being the only one dating - now that I sort-of-ish am - well at least getting out of the house and off this toneless telex offspring. I'll have much more interesting stories to tell at dinner parties than how Rupert changed a fuse in just one sock - he was so brave! and what the interest rate hikes mean to their holiday destinations!  Now! I'm not bitter - just practising!

      Debbie Harry is a Goddess! Ok - so she was backlit and had fans blowing her platinum retro hair, but there is no denying that she has It! and she can sing and move, one of the sexiest things I've witnessed - last year's Rugby World Cup aside.  In fact, I had the toppest of top nights - not only was the entertainment phenomenal, I had good company, good food and a new leather skirt which I picked up for pennies just when I thought I was going to have to go to the concert in my old jeans. Can a day get any better? I even came home to sexy text messages from an even sexier handsome tall guy. I had to have an early night - the excitement was too much - I was in bed by 2.30 am - alone and smiling.  This weekend has to have been one of the best I've had in years - Jack took part in his first ever athletics meeting yesterday - it was also my first encounter with athletics - could have done it at school if I'd bothered to ever take part in PE and drag myself out of the music practice rooms - but I didn't and I wouldn't have changed it for the world. But I'm so proud of Jack - he was the smallest of the competitors in his shotput event (and that's at 5'8"), representing his District - he came 3rd - and now represents the County at York next weekend - I am so proud!    I can't think this week will be half as eventful as the last has been, already Mr Monday has postponed - so I'm now preparing myself for the work schedule of a Junior Doctor - on the pay of a junior nurse ( by comparison) but I'm happy, a bit freckly from sitting in the sun ( I had to decamp to Rachel's garden 'cos my step father was too evident with his greenhouse to enjoy a proper sunbathe at home) and feeeeeeelllllllllin' pretty God Damn funky! Bring on Week Commencing Mon 14 June!

      I've made it to the end of the week and I still have some energy left. Quite remarkable given the number of late nights I've had - that Pro Plus stuff must be seriously good - either that or my body approves of the tee-total evenings I've had this week.  It's been quite eventful, well, for me at least. I'm beginning to see the benefits of knocking all the extra-curricular committee-ments on the head leaving me time to either really crack on at work, or else start to have a social life again. I've packed as much into this week as I would probably have done in 3 months this time last year. That's not to say it's masses, but by my standards it is - I've had 2 social encounters with men, spent a few hours with 2 seperate lots of old friends , catching up on each others lives and tomorrow I'm going to a gig with yet more friends. I'll have to watch I don't burn myself out!!  And all this in a week when I should have been sitting a Public Law exam which I managed to wriggle out of on the pretext that I was still getting used to my new job. I don't feel guilty either - I couldn't have performed as well at work if my mind had been on that, nor would I have had time to revise, so each area would have suffered - and I'd have been mostly wanting to lie on the sofa under a blanket in a semi-inebriated state.  Instead I have had a cracking 3 months and will have payed for my annual salary in bills delivered by a week on Thursday - anything after that until February is sheer profit - so I feel I have rewarded my lovely new bosses faith in me - justified my miraculously cured bank account (if anyone had told me this time last year that it was anything but terminal I'd have scoffed at them - but this - it's almost biblical in its transformation, there are still a few old wounds but they are healing quite nicely and not giving me any pain whatsoever and the experience has humbled me into being much more careful with my spending habits - just a bit concerned that Jack is showing signs of the illness) - and have interviewed quite a few potential candidates for my Conveyancing Assistant's role with a few more in the offing - so there is light at the end of the tunnel.  The best of it is that people have started noticing the weight I've lost,(now that can't be good grammar - surely they notice the weight when it's there in the first place, and miss it when it's gone) and I'm beginning to lose some of my inhibitions as things like my waist reappear.  And all these great things happening to me right now cannot be more aptly-timed for I fear I am about to become THE ONLY SINGLE ONE in our small but happy circle. Yes! Eva has been popped the question - she hasn't answered it yet - well at least she hadn't as we were texting one another as I drove home from failed-salsa attempt in Derby (the Evil Forces had simply conspired to get me there too late to make the class, no other reason)but she must be taking it seriously because she's already thought about her hen night or at least Roger the Fiance's suggestion that I could go over, we could sit in her lounge all evening and she could wear an L-plate on her back! I could not think of a more fitting way to celebrate! Nothing too far removed from one of our ordinary social nights but with a passing compliment to the traditions the occasion warrants - and if we stayed in instead of going to Barcelona, Dublin or Blackpool - we'd be able to afford Cristal, so we'd feel that we were particularly stylish and happening girls about town - had we bothered to get ready and go out.  He clearly doesn't know what will happen as my confidence continues to increase and the true me starts to reemerge from my winter shell - he'd better tell his best man to watch out!!

      I was up and at'em this morning and would have been an hour early for work,(think it might have had something to do with the endorphins released by chatting to Mr. Sunday, Mr Thursday-Night, Mr Next-Monday and Mr Weekend-Later-in-the-Month simultaneously last night - good job I'd stayed on the bottled water, wouldn't have wanted to get those messages mixed up) but I decided to use the extra time to make an 8-mile, half hour detour to the car hire place to pick up the gym bag and other stuff that I'd left in the Astra boot. I didn't think I'd have time tonight and didn't want to leave myself with an excuse not to go see the Cheese Nazi and her Scales of Fortune.  My conspiracy theory proved to be valid again! They'd only just gone to pick the car up, from the garage which I pass every morning on my way to work. They promised they wouldn't be long and suggested I wait - so I did - and I did - and I did - I rang my secretary to let her know where I was (20 minutes before she would have expected to see me, and made sure I stood where she could hear the traffic so she would believe me and not think I was just making up ever more elaborate excuses for having over-indulged on the internet the night before and overslept), I waited so long that another 5 minutes didn't seem to matter. I was so pleased to see the shiny car drive in, and dashed straight across to the driver as he got out. Sure enough, he knew I'd left some things in the boot, but he'd helpfully left them at the garage!!!   So I'd waited best part of 45 minutes for nothing! I'd been had again by the vicious Evil Force that prevents me from getting anywhere early ever, despite my best efforts - and it's not like I hadn't phoned them first thing Saturday when I realised what I'd done - I'd been so careful to ensure that I safely removed Jack's Gangsta Rap rubbish (which I've found myself singing along to a few times now - worrying) that I'd forgotten all about the stuff I'd put in the back.  Oh well! I got my £50 fuel deposit back and filled a Customer Satisfaction Questionnaire telling them about the dodgy fuel gauge. I don't think I'll be Customer of the Month somehow.  I made sure the payment slip fell out of my handbag when I got to work so my secretary could see that I hadn't been making it up. I feel guilty even when I know I've done nothing wrong.   And now I have no exercise clothes or trainers and time to make up at work so there's absolutely no way I'm going to Fat Club - guess I'll just stay here and drone into the dictaphone for a while longer - I don't want to go online tonight 'cos I'm interviewing with my lovely new boss at 9.30 in the morning for my assistant's position and I want to be all bright eyed and bushy-tailed. I've got away with it so far this week but I can't run the risk of getting lured in by one of the deceptively-charming, but probable servants of the Evil Force that delays me everywhere I go.

      It has been glorious sunshine outside today apparently. I've had to take everyone's word for it 'cos the only window in my office looks onto a grotty inner courtyard full of pigeon guano and rats, probably. I can't wait to move upstairs into my new office. It has 3 large windows, a huge old fireplace and a large walk-in cupbord, currently housing half a dozen filing cabinets - they are having it decorated for me! I get to pick the colour scheme! How exciting! I have wondered about suggesting they turn the glorified filing cupboard into a plush ensuite shower room so I have somewhere to get changed when I turn my attention towards running in my lunch hour- stop spluttering Eva! I used to go after work along the river bank so why not during the day?  We had a shower room at my old office. It was a double shower - always made my mind boggle why but then the boss was a very strange man! There was only really me that ever used it - well at least openly - living so far from work makes it difficult if you have anywhere to go in the evening. The first time I used it was just before a Works' Christmas party. I had a head full of conditioner when I noticed the water wsn't draining away. I panicked, I really didn't fancy a huge inquest into how I had managed to block a brand new shower and flood the new offices. I had to turn it off, splash myself with all the soapy water in the shower tray, and then turn it back on very quickly to rinse my  hair! I was not impressed! It did give me something to provocatively tell the boss about after a few glasses of wine and alerted them to the fact that the plumbers had filled the waste pipe up with mastic, or whatever that squirty sealant stuff is called. It took them a week to come and unblock it - my scummy hair-filled water stagnating there the entire week - yuk! Not my proudest moment.  I've just talked myself out off having them plumb this cupbaord for me - I'll just use it to lock my secretary in when she threatens to revolt!

      Ladies! There are handsome, sexy, well-mannered young men on this thing! I know! I just met one.  The Newton Bombshell!He was a little bit late,(only a few minutes but they seemed to go on forever) not his fault-accident-I managed not to run away but it did take a fag to keep me there and then I wished I hadn't. I was really nervous and wishing I'd chosen one of my fab new summer tops rather than my safe cashmere jumper- not a great choice for a hot early summer Sunday. I was really tempted to head back home and change - but the longer I dithered, the less of an option it became.  My trained teenage assassins were on alert and texting me for money for ice-creams - bless, this internet-dating is becoming as much a part of Jack and Boo's weekend as mine. I promised them a fiver to stay discreetly in the background. I spotted him driving in - and then didn't know what to do - should I stay by my car and watch him search? no - being a Taurean I took the bull by the horns and walked up, legs of jelly, hoped he wouldn't notice them, being all pale and not my greatest feature.  We lounged in the sun sipping champagne and munching on strawberries - very civilised. He was cool as a cucumber ( pointless apparently), not even phased when he poured half his fizz down his leg. I was really wishing I could suck it out for him but I'm sure I didn't give myself away. I can flirt like mad with someone I know is safe, but put a stud in front of me and I dry!  I would quite like to see this dark-haired Bomb again but doubt I will. I get the impression, without him actually having given much away, that he tends to go for tall leggy blondes with few brain cells - or maybe tall leggy blonde doctor types - either way, not short, chubby red-heads with teenage bodyguards in the background. The fact that he didn't give much away spoke volumes and I didn't want to keep asking questions in case it felt more like an interview than an afternoon in the sun. It was really a pleasant few hours and I can't wait for the day that I don't feel quite so inhibited by my weight and can actually flirt to my utmost ability - I'm really good at it and quite enjoy it but I am finding it hard to get back into the swing- and shy doesn't suit me!  I didn't go straight home but popped to see an old school mate and his wife for 20 minutes which turned into 3 hours and a pretty fab barbecue with his mum dad and 5 month old baby (he was 11 weeks premature so still very tiny). I noticed an ugly black bruise on my knee which I hadn't spotted earlier - maybe it was from when I kicked myself all the way back from the park.  Any way, all said, I'm feeling pretty optimistic about myself - sun and good company at the weekend has helped- a dancing date on Thursday, dinner the week after and a potential trip to Belfast in the offing all combine to keep me smiling and away from the cheese board.  Right - work!

      It's 5.30 am - just woken up on the sofa where I fell asleep about midnight - probably earlier as the telly was crap - I was determined not to be up all night chatting inanely to strangers so I've had a result - drinking water now and thinking about bed.  I've got a date today. I've bought so many new clothes lately I don't know what to wear.  Bed! Sleep! Worry about it later

      I thought yesterday was bad! It was! But not a patch on today.  I broke myself imposed curfew of midnight on a school night and stayed chatting on the internet til a stupid hour this morning, having opened a bottle of wine, washed down with a glass of Port!  So, of course I was late dragging my sorry ass out of bed which put everything behind for the rest of the day. I've just spent the entire day chasing my own tail! Completions all went well - thankfully only sales so not too demanding - but all my exchanges have just collapsed in a heap! The most unlikely people have pulled out nothing more than a whim! Leaving one of my oldest friends and his wife in a right old mess! I'll go and see them at the weekend and take them a bottle of wine - little consolation for having potentially lost their dream home, but a sympathy token nonetheless.  I've just taken the traitorous hire car back and picked up my own - she looks so nice after a valet - but that's left me over £120 light of pocket after having had a couple of measly bulbs fixed to get her through her MOT.  Now I'm back in the office - it's bliss not to hear the phone ringing - and about to start on this morning's post mountain. By the time I'm done, I'll be ready for a shower and another bottle of wine - but then it is the weekend! Think I have another date on Sunday! This one is really handsome and just the right age - 37 - Geordie too so likely to sound nice. Best have an early night tomorrow - face pack, foot scrub, the works, maybe I could just get a body double! Yawn!!!   Right - to work!!

      I don't know why I bothered getting up today. Yesterday was bad enough - £75 at the vets before even 9am! - but at least Darius has still got his eye! Jack had a sleepless night thinking he'd lost it to a big nasty street cat! He was so traumatised he even asked to come to work with me! Spent the day helping with the photo-copying, filing and post and enjoying being asked if he was on work experience from college and watching everyone's reaction when they heard he was my 13 year old son - I got a bit fed up with the comments about our comparative heights, specially as he leans nonchalantly on my shoulder at any possible opportunity! He particularly liked the jokey m-pegs my boss kept sending him until I pointed out to them both that I had work to do and neither of them were there for fun!  Yesterday did end slightly better when we headed into the UCI on the way home. I managed to stay awake through 2.5 hours of Harry Potter - a recommendation for a film if ever there was one, given my extreme fatigue by that point.  This morning I took Jack and Luke rock-climbing, or at the least, that was the plan. I hadn't actually booked it so I was stuck with 2 boys, kitted out for extreme sports, in the centre of a rainy Hull with everything shut except the shopping centre. The did do a bit of ice-skating, but soon got fed up when they fell over too much and realised there were no pretty girls to impress so they went back to the cinema and Jack sat through HP again - poor Luke, hope he didn't have a running commentary throughout. They still managed to munch through money like there was no tomorrow -but if it left me in peace at work I figured it was worth it!  It came as only a mild surprise to me when the brand spanking new hire car made a small cough on the way home, just as I was approaching a very busy roundabout, at the height of the rushhour. I had heard how economical diesel engines are but even I was beginning to think there might be something wrong with the fuel gauge after it had apparently only used 1/8th of a tank after 432 miles! So we then waited patiently for half an hour, accompanied by teenage stereo farting, for the AA man to come and rescue us. I was just glad no-one passing would recognize my car - not a hint of mud, peeling Iron stickers or bent bumpers in sight.  I managed to get Jack home in time to go out for a birthday tea with his grandma while I headed off to a bereavement client, only 15 minutes late. That went better and my woes have now pailed into insignificance.   Jack's back now and screaming for the keyboard - so I'm going to have a very small glass of wine and then maintain my early to bed routine for yet another night! It's nearly the weekend!

      I was horny as heck yesterday! Haven't known myself to be like it in years - it quite surprised me! I'd forgotten what a sexual animal I can be! One whiff of male hormone, even over cyber-space - and I'm keening! I did the only thing a self-respecting bitch on heat with no outlet can do, went to the Designer Outlet!  Armed to the elbows with posh bags that we could barely carry, even given the lightness of my purse, Jack and I drove home happy, accompanied by The Streets - apparently acceptable to teenagers given the level of obligatory swearing - and equally welcomed by Mum - it has poetry and humour and angst -like it!  I enjoyed driving the hire car too - great to get to 110 without your foot to the floor completely and know you won't have to suffer for it at a later date - it took me 40 mins to get to York! Whoosh! Baby, I'm flying! Took a while longer to get home 'cos I took the scenic(?) route through Selby - Jack complained that I was driving too slow, at 85! Guess who won't be allowed to drive alone til he's 29!!  I had a great time when I got home with all my smelly posh candles and body lotion - even enjoyed trying on my new SIZE  14  tops!!! I'm singing! I'm dancing! I'm hot to trot!

      I had a life changing telephone conversation today - with a cleaner! No more coming home on&nbsp;a Friday night to a grubby, untidy unwelcoming home - hello, shiny kitchen floor, clean windows, sparkling mirrors, dust-free skirting boards, carpet! She even irons!!!!  My life will be transformed - no more guilt, no more shame, no more piles of clothes threatening to swamp me like a mini Aberfan in my sleep. I had to keep my curtains closed tonight - we had 20 odd people down the garden - party for the Japanese. Mum had prepared a great spread - which was good 'cos i was starving - haven't had time for lunch this week - in fact&nbsp;I don't recall many breakfasts or dinners either, I did have a tin of cold macaroni cheese on Tuesday I think.  It's always the same people at these things - don't see much of them from one year to the next and then see them 3 times in a week- you start to run out of things to say - I almost told them about my online dating - good job I wasn't drinking - I might have started to show them some of my collected pictures!  I remembered at about 8.30 that&nbsp;I was supposed to be at a Singles Night in Leeds with Lorraine - I'm seeing her on Saturday - Eva's hen night - I'll make suitable apologies.   Talking of Eva - she's sold her flat in less than a day! Full asking price! First viewer bought! Look out Sheffield - here she comes! I'll miss the nights in Rodley - never did make it into the Barge - oh well! I'm sure the Lead Mill will more than compensate.  &nbsp;

      Everyone should have a Japanese exchange student - but only if they also have a Mum like mine. Not only did she pick him up for me yesterday, take him out for dinner and then drop him and Jack off for their trip to lincoln this morning, she also took them both out for dinner this evening - Giovanni's this time. It was supposed to be a night for the adults only, but there were 2 spare places and they both seem to have had a really good time.  Tomorrow they are going to Whitby for the day and then there is a party at ours in the evening - I did offer to help out but Mum has it all under control, she says. Even so, I think I might come home early, well earlier, and make sure she has chilled the wine and defrosted the sausages - menopause can have devastating effects on a hostess' ability.  Friday they are going to York. I might have to entertain them in the evening - pizza and a video me thinks - and then golf and rock-climbing on Saturday. My lovely clients, Mark & Becky, have said they can go free but only if I promise to go in trousers and have a go myself. The idea of a freebie certainly appeals but I'm not sure my confidence has grown sufficiently to relish having my arse strapped into a harness and raised 12 feet above one of my favourite client's head!   I will be saying Sayonara to my guest that evening as I have a pressing engagement in Leeds - Eva's hen night - she says she wants it low-key but I think she protesteth too much - I toyed with the idea of borrowing the communal blow-up doll ensemble from Vickie, but as Eva's not in that particular circle of friends and is unlikely to respect our unwritten rules, I might have to purchase new accoutrements - either that or get in touch with Hannibal Lecturer and see if he's available for a cabaret spot!  Cute Suit has been in touch again today, third time this week - and it's only Wednesday! I'm hoping he's holding back on the suggestion of dinner at San Pietro knowing how busy (!) I am with my foreign visitor (I have no idea how to spell or properly pronounce his name). He knows Jack is going to be away for most of August and that I'll be home alone - fingers crossed for a sizzling month!

      This week is going to be a doddle! The Japanese boy arrived and was picked up by my mum. I called on Sally & Lee on the way home, ex-colleague and friend (&amp; cheeky husband) who are&nbsp; moving(by the grace of god and my superior conveyancing abilities) on Friday. They are coming over to the civilised, albeit 1950s civilisation, side of the river. Had a cup of tea, signed a few boring forms and&nbsp;caught up on the chinwag.  I got home just in time to limply shake hands with my new temporary Far-Eastern adoptee&nbsp;and wave him off for a meal with Jack & my mum. Hope she'll be this attentive all week.  So I have enjoyed a very leisurely night on the sofa - 2 hour telephone conversation with my Cruse Chair - she's lovely - and a brief snooze. The house is reasonably acceptable, the kids are sorted (thanks, Mum), my able assistant has everything under control at work, and work has started on decorating my new office, and Cute Suit is as prolific with his emails as ever. All is well with the world.

      I feel like Julie Andrews. Last year Jack stayed with Soh, the year before that we hosted Koh - tomorrow Toh arrives. If my blog disappears,&nbsp;I may well have run off to Austria to be a nun!&nbsp;  I'm beginning to wonder about all this hosting lark - I stopped cleaning at 11.30 tonight- missed a double run of Coronation Street - and had no tea ( fantastic! diet slipped a bit while yon Brow was plagueing us). I might have to ring Cute Suit's cleaner and book her from tomorrow.  I&nbsp;also bought a dress for Eva's wedding - silk, lavender, corset style :-/ it looked good in the shop and was in the sale - which meant a larger budget for the shoes, handbag and pashmina - decided against a hat - I think it might be too flamboyant amongst 6 other guests.  I've made the bed, put out clean towels, cleaned the house, but forgotten the flowers - last weeks' lilies are looking very tired - I hope Toh thinks they are an avant garde Ikibana display. Roll on August - Jack in Spain - me out of pain!  &nbsp;

      Well the eye mask worked. For the first time in a week my puffy, cold-affected eyes looked acceptable, my hair fell perfectly about my shoulders and I took 2 changes of top and a spare pair of tights to work. Jack thought I should wear the stripey blouse - he's obviously acquired a sense of the slimming effect of vertical stripes osmotically, and has an inate knowledge that fabric stretched tautly across the female chest is good. Jacquie preferred the baby pink scoop neck - I went with her recommendation.  I was on tenterhooks from about 12.45 - I knew his hearing was at 12.30 and being a simple Directions, wouldn't take long. It didn't - my mobile rang at 12.55 - he was on his way into Reception. And there he was, looking just as&nbsp;I remembered him, smiling eyes, lovely broad shoulders and a well-fitted Cute Suit!  I wasn't sure how to greet him. I normally sweep confidently through the door and extend my hand to my waiting clients whilst introducing myself - but he wasn't a client - and I wasn't brave enough to peck him onthe cheek - something which I would normally do on a regular date - so I just popped my head round the door and said " Hi - are you ready?" Doh! I hope he couldn't see I was shaking mildly.  He asked if he could leave his briefcase somewhere, I took him though to my office, wishing I'd tidied it up a bit more. My large fan was on, and I stood right in front of it, well it worked for Debbie Harry!   We went to Venn - the newest and best restaurant in town - just got mentioned in the Michelin Red Guide - and had a drink whilst pondering over the menu - we both chose sausages and mash washed down with fizzy water. Paul, the owner, wasn't there which was a bit disappointing - I had wanted to look popular and well-known - but the waitress did a sterling job.  Lunch was yummy, the conversation flowed perfectly, the body language was very encouraging, and the leather seats clearly impressed him.&nbsp; It was delightful - we had coffees and chatted and chatted and then realized it was 3pm - we reluctantly sauntered back to my office and he lingered about, I think a little uncertain whether to kiss me. I hung back a bit, not certain whether Jacquie was skillfully aiming her handbag mirror round the filing cabinets ( I discovered later that she had cleared her desk in one leap as we'd left and positioned herself under the blinds to cop a glimpse).  I got a text just after 5pm - very good sign - I think I will be hearing more from him very soon.  So today I spent the afternoon watching Jack & Byron try their hands at rock-climbing. They loved it - 3 hours of extreme exhilaration - and that was just sitting watching - both of them showed a flair for it - and it didn't go unnoticed that the regular guys had rippling muscles and six-packs. They were exhausted when we left - could barely grip a bottle of water. They want to go again next week.  Tonight was a party at Jack's Headmaster's. He was the only pupil amongst a number of teachers, fortunately all the ones he likes and gets on well with, it rained, but there were enough gazebos and a large well lit garage so spirits were not dampened. I was driving so there was never any danger of embarrassing him in the hot tub with his DT teacher. It was a very pleasant evening, good company, lots of well-prepared food and a beautiful garden overlooking the river. I haven't felt this relaxed and happy in ages.

      He's gone! Ca c'est formidable!!! It was well worth getting up at 4am and standing around the council car park. I started to get a bit nervous when they still hadn't driven off after 50 minutes, one person was late (and for once it wasn't me - we were almost first there).&nbsp; Victor had swapped seats so couldn't see us, so I saw our opportunity and Jack & I legged it back to the car and drove off at speed, just in case there was a serious delay and they tried to make us take him back again.  I went straight to work. The car park attendant was a bit surprised to see me pull up behind him as he was unlocking the gates, specially as my make-up was still in its bag and not yet on my face.   I always really like early mornings, I must try and see more of them at the start of a day instead of on my way to bed.  I had a pretty cracking day all round in fact. My new assistant started working for me, the decorator was booked and came and started measuring up my new office - I'm getting new carpet, paint, furniture and have been given the green light to go to IKEA and buy whatever I want to make it a bit more homely, and something else happened at the very end of the day that I don't want to say too much about just yet, in case I jinx it, but I am really really looking forward to tomorrow lunchtime.  Talking of which, I must get my beauty sleep - more important than ever. I have new shoes, eye mask chilling in the fridge for the morning, and I'm about to paint my nails. Zippadee do-dah, zippidee day, my oh my...............

      I am despairing of my French ward. He has expressed interest in only 2 things - rugby and Lord of The Rings. Yesterday I took him into a Dungeons &amp; Dragons type shop where they sold all sorts of models and battle gear - he just looked around, shrugged and walked out.  &nbsp;  This morning he was invited to the rugby club for the training but he chose to stay in his room - all day! The boy is clearly bored at best, thoroughly miserable more likely. Ben came over with his motorbike this afternoon and he didn't even raise his brow! I was blagged into going and getting them some petrol and Jack &amp; Ben disappeared off to churn up some field somewhere down the bottom end of the village.  &nbsp;  Conscious that he hadn't come out of his room even for food or drink, I rustled up some Tuna Melt and a glass of apple juice and then invited him to Tesco with me - I know it's hardly the most tempting offer for a teenager, but I did explain he could choose what he wanted to eat in his pack-up tomorrow and that there were lots of things he might want to buy, cds, dvds, magazines,clothes, sweets etc. Personally I love nothing more than wandering around foreign supermarkets, I&nbsp;always come away with lots&nbsp;of exotic goodies and a few comics or magazines to look through.&nbsp;He swiftly rejected the idea and continued to make notes on Napoleon! I think he's still seething from Agincourt! Honestly! I cannot understand why on earth he got involved with this exchange when he obviously hates the English (I'm not so paranoid that I think it's just us - it really is a national thing). It's bothering me, but I do have to realise that you can't win 'em all.  &nbsp;  He ate all the Lasagne I cooked this evening, left most of the salad (that was Italian, perhaps he just dislikes all things pas Francais) and did venture out long enough to watch some TV with Jack, although I'm not sure he ever spoke.  &nbsp;  I watched a bit of the golf, just in case I bump into the Cute Suit anytime soon, helps to do a bit of homework sometimes, and I found myself strangely enjoying it - I didn't know you had play-offs in such an ambulatory sport - bet the ball would have ended up on the beach if Beckham had been taking a swing.

      I love London. I love the shops, the sights, the diversity, the vibrancy. I never imagined there would ever be a day when I was ready for going home within less than an hour of getting there.  &nbsp;  The journey there passed rather enjoyably thanks to a number of text messages from Cute Suit. I'd managed to blag the front seat behind the driver - I'm not good as a passenger - too used to being in control - but it went downhill the minute we got there. We took the Tube fromMarble Arch to Westminster and walked along the Embankment, navigating hoards of tourists, across the Golden Jubilee Bridge to the Eye. There was a huge queue, but it seemed to be moving fairly quickly to my mind, not so to my 2 teenage companions so we decided to give that a miss and I rang Kathryn to meet us.  &nbsp;  We walked along Whitehall, all the while cursing my decision to wear Shantung silk mules in British Summer, I stopped off at a small drugstore for industrial strength pain-killers (my left sinus was loudly heralding its arrival in the Smoke and my right ear was aching), whilst Kathryn and her 5th limb, her camera, tried to persuade Jack and Le Frown to pose for photos on the lions at Trafalgar Square. There was an anti-landmine demonstration going on - piles of assorted footwear all over the place - I was tempted to swap the rather fine numbers I was sporting for some comfy old trainers.  &nbsp;  We quickly headed for Lillywhites - both boys like sport so we figured they'd be happy - Jack's usual enthusiasm for shopping was very evident and he came away with a few bags of assorted kit for the coming season - Le Frown did at least show a passing interest for some of the rugby wear but it was very shortlived. I had originally suggested throwing some money at them and abandoning them in the Trocadero which had been met with disdain by my sis but it didn't take her long to agree with my sentiments so we headed there - even that wasn't good enough. Jack had a couple of goes on various things - he was the fastest Bull Thrower today apparently - but Le Frown just well, frowned.  &nbsp;  To cut the story of an interminably long day short, we just wandered about a lot - you will probably be appalled at my lack of imagination and poor host skills - I would be too were it not for the knowledge that I suggested loads of things, none of which raised more than a Gallic shrug. We strolled through China Town, Covent Garden, Soho - (by this point I was getting so frustrated at the lack of responsiveness from my temporary adoptee, that&nbsp;I was tempted to give him £20 and push him in a private club - see if that would make him animate!!)  &nbsp;  Jack was happy because he bought himself some Nike Air Force Ones (cool, apparently) Kathryn was happy because I bought her a&nbsp;very fine&nbsp;evening beaded poncho as an early birthday present, I was happy because we had a tasty lunch in a bustling teppenyaki bar - Le Frown? No idea!! He expressed his usual level of emotion - nil.  &nbsp;  I was so pleased to get back on that coach - which turned out to be the highlight of the day - the teacher in charge asserted her authority and sat next to me on the journey back up the A1. I'd never met her before this exchange. We had a terrific conversation which made the 5 hours pass like 5 minutes - I know her partner - an Italian Jew from Darlington who happens to be one of my co-bereavement counsellors - what are the chances of that happening?  &nbsp;  In fact I enjoyed the chat with her so much I almost didn't mind the fact that not only had I missed the off-licence last night but I'd also got back after Tesco had shut so I've had&nbsp;the driest weekend in (my) recent history.  &nbsp;  4 more nights, 3 more full days and a ridiculously early start and we can wave Au Revoir to our Bete Noire!!!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      To add insult to injury I got stopped by&nbsp; a random police check on the way home from work tonight. Had I been drinking? No!! I had not! It was 9.50pm on a Friday night so he can be forgiven for thinking I should have been! I'm sure he had a look of pity on his face as he waved me on. &nbsp; That small delay meant my regular offie was shut so I've had to come home after a gruelling 13 and half hour day to half a bottle of poxy cheap mid-week Chilean Chardonnay. It's the weekend! I know it! You know it! Will somebody please tell my life that! &nbsp; I'm still sneezing, coughing and spluttering. I was very tempted to curl up in a ball under my desk and weep like a baby at one point today but I'm nothing if not determined so I fought my way through it. I've actually had a very productive day - Ling has gone! I haven't taken a lunch break all week (who am I kidding - all year!) so I hadn't bought her anything - not even a card - but as more and more people started asking me how to spell her name - is it "ra" or "orah"? I was finally shamed enough to pop out to M&amp;S and get her a really stylish plant and card. I even splashed out on Vanilla Slices for the entire floor! &nbsp; I was really nice to her as well - with hindsight I realise the whole experience would have been so much better if I'd tried that at the start of May instead of 2 hours before she left! Not that I was nasty - forfain!! I never am! but I can be&nbsp;a bit of a salty cow sometimes. &nbsp; Anyway, my good deed paid off! I had an email from Cute Suit whilst I was away from my desk, followed by a phone chat ( I made sure the girls had gone home and shut my doors) and further text messages. It has lifted my spirits enough to decide to brave London myself with Jack and Le Brow tomorrow (I rang my Mum at lunchtime when I was feeling particularly poorly and sorry for myself and tried to bribe her into taking my place with the promise of lunch with my sister paid for by me, but she saw through the ruse and realised it would also mean traipsing around with 2 moody teenagers in the rain).  &nbsp; I figure I can sleep all the way there and back (I'll take my book just in case) and if all else fails I'll shove some cash in their hands, point them in the general direction of the Trocadero (hope they don't miss it and end up in SoHo) and Kathryn and I can head for a swanky wine bar. &nbsp; Got to go! Up at 6!!!!! ( Lord! It is the weekend! Give a girl a break!!)

      Rush! Rush! Rush! That's all I seem to do at the moment - even my nose is streaming at a rate of knots. If I'm not dropping off kids, I'm picking them up, or making them pack-ups, or washing their clothes.&nbsp; &nbsp;  I treated my car to a rinse through the wash, she's sounding almost as poorly as me so I'm being uncharacteristically nice, before having a quick nap in the car wiating for the kids to stop snogging. Net result - I left work at 5.30 but never actually saw the inside of my lounge until after 10.30. Great for weight-loss! I always try to see the positive.  &nbsp;  I can't even look forward to the weekend particularly - having booked us all on a day-trip to London. We have to catch the coach at 7am, which means a 6 o'clock start (!!) and won't get back home til 11ish. I hope St Swithin's on&nbsp;a career break!  &nbsp;  On the plus side I've done 4 swears today, bought the girls on reception a big box of posh chocolate biccies in the hope that they'll keep passing them my way - it all helps toward the Send Jack To Spain For The Entire Month Of August campaign! And I've had some more emails and texts from Cute Suit - all unsolicited (no pun etc) - and my new office is now vacant and just waiting to be decorated and recarpeted for me.  &nbsp;  There's a bit of a power struggle going on between my long-standing secretary and my new assistant as to who gets the seat closest to the Lord's right hand - or my side door as the case may be - I may have to interevene and decree that Jacquie gets it - from a practical point of view it would be convenient to have Lisa within hollering distance - but then Jacquie knows when my face says Do Not Disturb - Important Cute Suit on Line 1!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I'be dot a dold! I thought I was just in a crabby mood when I woke up yesterday but the sneezing started by about 10am and it was rapidly downhill, mainly down my nose in fact, and by last night I was shivering, coughing and could barely breathe - I just about managed to stay up to watch Grif and his ruins and then turned in for the night - wish I'd realized that the non-drowsy Sudafed meant stimulant! I endured one of those nights where you toss and turn and seem to look at the clock every hour and only 5 minutes has passed - I then fell asleep at about 6, just before the alarm went off.  So I felt rubbish all day, perked up a bit when I got some emails from Cute Suit ( I got one at the weekend from his home address too :-)) and then had to sit through almost 3 hours of boring meeting before waiting in the car for 45 mins for Jack and Le Brow to leave their disco - I utilised the time by reclining the seat and having a snooze - God! when did I start to turn into my Dad!  I hope I feel better tomorrow - I want to start looking for an outfit for Eva's wedding and nothing looks flattering when you have a big red shiny nose and puffy eyes. But then again, it's nice to have an excuse to look awful rather than the fact that you just do!

      The French boy's Unibrow has more personality than he himself has! I have rarely come across someone so uncommunicative. It's going to be an incredibly long 2 weeks. He's polite and all that, but he just doesn't do or say anything - and it's not the language barrier, I'm sure - I can babble on about rubbish just as well in French as I can English.  He came with me to Presentation Evening tonight. Granted, it's dull, even I was beginning to lose the will to live, especially when the orchestra started up with Mambo No.5 and we were expected to clap along - I think that was just because they didn't have a conductor and needed help with the timing. To think what I must have put my mum through for all those years - and at least this was quite modern and upbeat - not Gaslight Gaieties and The Dambusters! We did The Winner Takes It All once - I had to do the Intro on the sax - took me weeks to get it right and once I had that's all I played (and The Muppet Song)for months, nay years after.  Jack got the Sports Prize - bless! He's supposed to be taking part in the District Athletics tomorrow but has suddenly developed a surprising desire to ensure that Le Brow doesn't feel excluded and has rather opted to go on the day trip with the exchange students - I suspect the fact that they are calling in at Meadowhall for a few hours has more to do with it - all his birthday money burning a hole in his pocket.  Just got off the phone from Eva - she's set a date - the Glorious Twelfth! And I'm invited!! She's already worried about what I'm going to wear - especially when I mentioned this PVC fetish site that someone had told me about. Well she said I wasn't to choose anything too pale to ensure she shines on her big day - what can be more different than a boned quarter-cup corset and matching spanking skirt! The PVC trench coat would prevent any embarrassing photographs! She's such a control freak! - lol

      The party went reasonably well. The 28 or so teenagers were well behaved and polite in the most part and my hot dogs and Nigella Onion Mush was well received. There was only one casualty - Laura was a bit pooorly, bless her. I put her to bed and kept a close eye on her - couple of hours later and she had made a remarkable recovery. Boo was bouncing off the walls a bit too but she managed to keep her dignity.  I was a bit concerned when I discovered one of the girls was still in Year 6 - I think she was someone's younger sister - but she tended to hover around the kitchen near me so I think she was pretty safe. One of the boys was a bit older too - 16 - just left school - he didn't look it - but he was fine - think he was after one of the girls.  They were all nice kids, very chatty, I can't be doing with shifty quiet ones, and they all slept down the garden in the tents eventually - apart from Victor, who had mixed really well but had the common sense to grab a comfy bed.  It was all cleared up and back to normal by the time I surfaced this morning. The kids had all gone home, camp had been broken, all the cans and bottle tops had been picked up and even the brazier had been swept out. Jack had even hoovered. I think they had such a good time, they were keen to keep on my good side so they can do it again the next time Mum and John go away. I don't mind as long as they stay down the bottom of the garden and don't disturb the neighbours - that's my job when I have a party every couple of years.  I'm cooking traditional Cottage Pie for Victor now. I had thought about doing a proper roast but the fridge is so full there would be nowhere to keep any leftovers. Jack will pretend not to like it but will clear his plate soon enough. Then strawberries and ice-cream. I like all this entertaining lark!

      This could be a very long 2 weeks. When I said Victor was quiet, I hadn't bargained for just how uncommunicative he is - all he does is lay on his bed reading comics. Jack is really making an effort and trying to get him involved with things, suggesting games to play, films to watch, music to listen to, but Victor is having none of it.   Byron came over this morning - he's back from Spain for a few weeks - and has come to stay for the night - he and Jack optimistically set up the tent at the bottom of the garden and carried armfuls of blankets, duvets, pillows etc down there - Victor just lay on his bed - didn't show the slightest bit of interest. They've all walked over to the next village this afternoon to meet up with some of the others and attend the Summer Fayre. Victor has gone too, I hope he's not dreadfully unhappy or homesick.  I've had an even lazier day than normal. The housework is all done, all I had to do was push the Dyson around and put in the odd load of washing. I was so bored I found myself cleaning the cooker! I even took the heavily-baked-on rings off and scrubbed them til they were gleaming. I've toyed with the idea of cleaning the windows or doing the ironing, but I need to leave myself something exciting to do tomorrow after rugby-training.  I think I might go and bake some Nigella Snickerdoodles and Granny Boyd Biscuits now - the girls will be dead impressed with Jack's mum then - beautiful, clever, immaculate house and wholesome ability to bake and not worry about her enviable figure!! I need to get out the house - I'm becoming delusional! Quick! Tesco! Help me!!

      Victor est arrivee! (if anyone knows how to type accents, please let me know - I can do it in Word but not sure on this site). He is very polite, if a little quiet. Jack and he seem to share a common love of eating and generally lounging about making my newly-decluttered house look positively hovel-like. Fortunately, they can spend their time in my Mum's lounge while she is away.  I managed to get them to school on time, I was a bit late picking them up again and then again for the meeting tonight but 1 out of 3 isn't bad for me. The meeting was over and done with very quickly so I needn't have worried aobut getting to the cricket. In fact, I really needn't as it was cancelled due to a water-logged pitch. I was looking forward to that too!  I dropped a card and some B&Q vouchers through Vickie's letter-box, she saw me and beckoned me in so I had a coffee, saw her fab dress and heard all about her day. Jack and Victor had originally not really wanted to go in, but after 7-year old Tom showed them his hamster, gerbil and the mini-fridge in his bedroom, they were quite happy. I swear I even saw Jack help Olivia dress one of her Barbies.  I've just dropped them in the next village so Victor can meet some of Jack's friends. Apparently a dozen or so of them are coming over for a party tomorrow night. They were meant to be camping but given the typical British weather we are having I imagine I will have a houseful of excited teenagers lolling all over the furniture instead. I can't argue, well, I could, but as Jack knows about the party I had when I was 15, which still gets mentioned to this day by total strangers and has featured on Friends Reunited, I have a very poor defence.  Oh, and the completion with the Cute Suit went very smoothly, all done by 11am - we had a very brief conversation to confirm it before he dashed off to court. That would normally have been sufficient, there was absolutely no reason for him to call me back just after lunch for a general chat. I felt a bit sad that the matter had come to an end and reminded him that we would have no cause to speak again but he reassured me that there would be some "snagging" issue that was bound to come up next week. I hope he thinks of one quick!

      I very nearly drove to Lisa'a last night for Vickie's hen night. In fact I did drive there, after waiting 20 minutes outside, my shiny smooth hair getting blown all over the place, for Vickie not to pick me up. We'd spoken earlier and I had thought I'd arranged a lift, but apparently not. I passed Vickie just as I got to Lisa's, having arrived without me and being immediately sent out to fetch me. After a bit of toing and froing, I was persuaded to take my car back, with Vickie following behind  - bless she'd done that short stretch of road 4 times already.  Lisa had recycled some of the gifts she'd been given on her hen night in Newcastle 4 years ago, including Blow-Up Brian who we'd handcuffed her to for a while wearing a flashing sash and Neil's leopard skin silk boxers(!)a whip and vibrator the size of a small child. Vickie is the new custodian of these items, to be passed on to the next one of our group to get married. I'm not losing any sleep over where I would have to store them!  We had a really good laugh and I took full advantage of not having to drive - particularly as I had today off work. I wasn't up too early though - managed to start cleaning by about lunchtime - and I have worked like a demon. I can now confidently welcome the French Exchange Student into my home later this evening without worrying about the state of the place. I needn't live in fear of anyone dropping round unexpectedly either. I am going to make a concerted effort to find a cleaner before it deteriorates into squalor again.  I am worrying about how on earth I am going to juggle work, school runs and all the other social activities that are planned over the next couple of weeks. Mum and John are going to Silverstone tonight to see the Grand Prix at the weekend, so I can't rely on them for transportation.  Tomorrow, I have to get both boys to school for 8.15am, then get myself to work across the Bridge, hoping my completion with the Cute Suit goes well, then head back for 3.30pm to pick them up, feed them , get them back into town for a Welcome Reception for 5.30pm and then over to the KC Stadium for a cricket match at 7pm, picking Sophie up on the way. And that's just the first day! There are 13 more to go like that! I can feel some more weight-loss coming on!

      I am doing cartwheels! Metaphorically - not literally  - though for the first time since I was about 12 I am actually tempted!  I HAVE AN ASSISTANT! AND SHE'S EXPERIENCED, GOOD, FAST, AND QUIETER THAN ME!!!!! Quite simply, she's perfect.  Can't talk now - got to write to the disappointed candidates - but you can bet I'll be back later tonight.  Happy Days are here again! :-)

      Yesterday was Jack's birthday. He didn't get the motorbike he wanted - had to make do with new aggressive in-line skates. He seemed pretty chuffed with them - and so was I - they were half price! And he knew it - so I ended up taking him and Boo out for a Chinese - starters, duck, main courses, skipped the puddings - Banana fritters don't really do it for us, coffees, I drew the line at brandy and cigars - he is still only 14, even if the tarty young waitress thought he was about 17! Flirt!!  We were the last to leave the restaurant - maybe I've created another hedonist in the family - we can even have a good time on Coca-Cola.  I was in sensible parent mode all night and even went to bed when I got in - sans wine, sans chatting, sorry, Throbbie! It did mean I was bright-eyed and bushy-tailed this morning - had a stupendously productive day today - both Ling and Lang were back at work, and one of my colleagues lent me a spare secretary so I'm almost up-to-date - think I may even have found a suitable assistant at long last - but I've got 2 more to interview tomorrow so we'll see what happens by the end of the week. I once considered HR as a career - don't think I would have been cut out for it though.  I also managed to exchange contracts on that case with the Cute Suit from North Lincolnshire yesterday - I was tempted to drag it out a bit longer so as to prolong the need to continue the flirty banter but then I'm secretly hoping he is being professional and waiting for it to finish before he invites me out - then again, he's probably just being professional and that'll be the last I have to do with him for another 10 years or so!  I had intended to rush home from work at 8pm tonight to start delousing the house before the french exchange student turns up on Thursday night - a fortnight - not sure my shoolgirl French will last much beyond Friday morning - but Sophie called and asked me round to her posh new pad for supper - (this must be how a midwife feels being invited to a christening of one of her deliveries). We had a lovely evening - the time flew by - it was 11.30 before we knew it and I had to say my good-byes - not before having a good old yarn about Martin - another of my potential successes bringing those two together - that was pure inspiration!  I've got Vickie's unexpected hen-night tomorrow - nothing ostentatious, but that's Vickie for you: self-deprecating, shuns any form of attention, patience of a saint, incredibly kind, thoughtful, and sensitive, wickedly funny,- I'm sure it will be hilarious - we all go back over 20 years and have been recent partici"pants" in Knicker Exchange thanks to our host, Lisa (I'll save her description for another blog - and an update on my most recent underwear parcel).  And thus ends another perfect day when I have yet again managed to avoid any form of housework or domestic activity whatsoever.

      I wasn't sure whether Ian was joking when he promised to wear his thong to bring breakfast this morning. I was so relieved when Lynn, his recently-installed girlfriend knocked on the spare bedroom door and handed me a coffee and a plate of warm buttery crumpets.   I used to work with Ian. He's a real sweetheart, 56, ex-CID, came home one day to find a note from his wife of 35 years to say she'd left him for a younger man who she'd been seeing for the past year or so whilst he underwent surgery and chemotherapy for throat cancer. It gutted him as you would imagine, but he's turned the corner now and seems genuinely happy with his new lady.  We were all going to a party at Ian's cousin's. I now work with Neil and was looking forward to meeting some of my colleagues and their partners out of the office. It was a fun night - not as riotous as the one last week - and thank goodness for patio heaters. I think I was the only single one there but it didn't stop the women from talking to me - which was nice!   Thankfully, I had very little to drink, by my standards, so I had no trouble getting up early and home in time to pick Jack up from rugby training. We then had to hot foot it over to the Showground where Jack was taking part in the Athletics at the local agricultural show. He came third in his race - his school second overall and it stayed warm and sunny -result!  We've just popped home for him to have a shower and then we're going over to Rachel's. Wonder what room she'll have decorated this time? There's a different colour every time you go round - wonder if she'll hire Steve out? I might feel more inclination to tidy up if it didn't still look so grubby after I'd finished.

      I've got another quasi-celebrity claim to fame - but I can't really tell you about it - and it isn't really that great!  But do you remember Survivor - that reality show where they put a load of dreadful people in an even worse place to see who started to eat each other first? Well it turns out, a chap I've been emailing on a particular matter was part of the show! Gosh! I might have been even nicer to him if I'd known - you know how Starstruck I get!  Anyway, that brightened up an otherwise boring afternoon - I've had a pretty uneventful sort of day really, trough after the peak maybe - not that it was low in any way, nor that the last few days have been high! Mind you, I did like getting texts late from that cute solicitor - and I blush now when I remember suggesting we bunk off work for the afternoon and go to the park - I didn't think for a minute he would bite - and he didn't - good job, too, as I had appointments booked this afternoon - now I just pray something proper happens on this case so I have a serious rather than tenuous reason to make contact.  Got to shop for birthday gifts for Jack this weekend - he wants a motorbike - I was thinking more book tokens! Maybe we'll meet in the middle somewhere - like a biking DVD - or I could take him to Cadwell - now that's a thought - men in leather.

      I was in bliss for an hour and a half tonight! I cannot remember the last time I felt so relaxed.  I had a facial complete with head and shoulder massage. I think I dozed off a bit - cos Gianna re-entered the room just as Mum was about to tell me that all my Received Files had been sent to her PC too! That would have been a total nightmare - no expert needed to analyse that dream!  It's funny - you encounter all types on here - and some you accept, some you reject, some you are indifferent to - much like reality really, only easier - you can press a "Block" button and instantly all is well with the world- but I wonder how many of the people that you actually choose to correspond with would be chosen in everyday life! How many people do I dismiss as not clever enough, not witty enough, not interesting enough, not attractive enough? Would I gravitate away or towards them in an ordinary situation? Surely, we'd never meet otherwise.  I quite liked getting text messages from that sexy blonde (not my usual type) solicitor at 1.am this morning - I didn't reply - he needs to think I am wholesome and in bed at that time(as of course I alomst was) - it put a smile on my face and I didn't even mind being at work when he and Jack (seperately) had the day off to go and watch the Test Match at Headingley.  Now I'm just wondering what he will think of tomorrow as an excuse to email me! and also wondering if this is all just in my head and he really is just thinking about the particular case in hand. Time will tell.

      It's the weekend - official! Nadia has won - I wept - fuck knows why - but I did! I thought my days of weeping at Andrex adverts was over but I guess I'm still soft. I have made a conscious effort to stay away from BB this year - I really am not in the slightest bit interested - but Jack kept coming through with titbits and I eventually succumbed.  Do not think for one minute that the new TV has anything to do with being able to watch the Final Eviction! Fuck! No! The Olympics and Restoration Final only!  I counted up what work I had left on my desk tonight when I sneaked off at 6.20 -  7 contracts to check (3 of them are big 'orrible ones) and 2 files from hell. That is the lightest my desk has been in the last 10 years at least - wish my scales would match it. I used to get anxious at this sort of time - that nobody wanted me and that I would be sad and redundant within the month - but I have learnt from experience that this time of year is always a bit slow and that it soon starts to flood back in when the hols draw to a close -it seems to have started, I've opened 9 new files in 5 days  - that's far less than I was doing a few months ago - but much more manageable - especially with my super-duper Lisa.  So what do I have planned for the weekend? - absolutlely sweet FA - Result or what? I can sleep in without conscience - my wedding outfit is sorted and if worst comes to shove - I can always give Eva&Roger an IOU - I know exactly what I want to buy them - but having spent a few hours surfing the net and only finding the type of thing in the £150-800 price bracket, they might have to wait whilst I save up or think of an alternative. It will be fab whatever it is!

      What is going on here? I made a fab posting last night but it doesn't appear to have saved at all. Oh well - I can't remember what it said so it can't have been that great.  I had a day off today. Quick smell these salts!! I know - it came as a surprise to me too - but I thrive on spontaneity in small doses and as I was in very real danger of over-sleeping, I decided to spend some quality time=money with my son. We went shopping!  5 hours and a dozen or so bags later and we headed home with my 6 months supply of scented candles, new nail polish, a silver poncho - just in case I had to resort to the silver dancing shoes to go with my lilac corset dress for the wedding - and 2 purportedly expensive coats for Jack that we had snapped up for £75!  I wasn't content with that - I just had to call into all the shops that I knew would still be open when we got back home - and what do you know?! I got the perfect silk mules for my outfit - for just £6!!!! Ecstatic or what! and I even picked up a shawl in just the right shade of lilac so now I will be able to attend the wedding comfy in the knowledge that my hideously unattractive gnat bites are covered.  I didn't stop there - I bought a telly too - just 15 minutes before the store shut - Craig, the incredibly cool manager, who clearly had far more important things to do and was way too important to bother with eye-contact - casually slipped my card through the thingy - and dismissively told me it was rejected - then patronisingly suggested that I might have given him an old one - Tosser!  I, for once, calmly accepted it was a mistake - I really didn't like the way he called me "Miss" - not something I ever have a problem with -but from a 24 year old bum-fluffed shop assistant who then proceeded to call me "Love" - ffs - I sped round to the Morrisons cash point - checked my balance - phew! still healthy - and happily parted with £150 in return for my new 21" Nicam TV - teletext and everything - haven't had that before - I even bought a new hairdryer.  I would potentially have bought a Tumble Dryer and Fridge Freezer if Craig hadn't been a Wanker of The First Order. Mum has offered me her old F/F - bless her. What will I do to while away my nights if I don't have to chip ice off the inside door anymore? And I figure my new cleaner might be able to hang my clothes out so the T/D isn't a priority.  Lorraine left a message on the answerphone - looks like we might be going to see Madonna after all - just need to check out how expensive these flight tickets are going to be - and I am really starting to worry about the groaning sounds emitting from under my bonnet every time I turn the steering wheel - I can't turn the steroe any louder until my sinusitis has thoroughly cleared up.

      The week has started off well - my gnat bites are fading and don't make me look quite so much like a domestic violence victim, my bank balance has been refuelled, and all my friends are happy well and either expecting babies, recently married or about to be, even Marko has had a few days off work and has more lined up soon.  It's at times like this that I used to feel redundant - no-one wanting to pour out their souls or release vitriol, left me with time to ponder on my own shortcomings which would either cause me to take up knitting or spend even longer hours at work. I am now doing neither, although I do fancy I could knock up a rather stylish poncho if I set my mind to it.  I am actually enjoying the time to spend just reading, or dozing and even the opportunity to get away from work by 6.30! I left tonight with just 6, yes half a dozen, files to work on - it is almost unknown - ok - so I do have about 12 tapes waiting, all of which have about 20 files on them which will eventually find their way back onto my desk - but even so, it's pretty remarkable - hence I mention it.  I did almost have a confrontation with my Mum tonight - Jack had told her that I wouldn't go to Japan next year if her and John (aka Stepmonster) go - not quite what I had said - more that I had only expressed a desire to go when I thought they weren't - she wanted a chat about why - I was tired and can't get into deep mother-daughter heart to hearts at the best of times - I just denied it and smiled that of course I would love for us all to go as one big happy family - Lovely!  She didn't hang around so I think she was satisfied - I wish I could tell her that she isn't the problem - but where would I start? and how could I stop once started? Anyway - who will look after the cat and the fish and the dogs and the chickens and the ducks? Good job I persuaded her that I don't have to make a decision for at least another 9 months.

      Was it really only Thursday that I made my last posting? So much seems to have happened.  Friday started very strangely - first time in over 15 years that I haven't been in control of my own completions - and I had loads - but my Able Assistant seemed to have everything in hand, so i started on my post about 8 hours earlier than usual - a good omen for getting away early that night for the Head's party.  I made the foolish mistake of mentioning to the boss, just after lunch, that I was in danger of actually getting caught up to date and that he might want to think about sending some more work my way. Classic error!  By 2pm I was frantically trying to trace money from Bristol bound for South Africa, had the possibility of 2 families sleeping in a van with all their belongings (one of whom was an old friend and colleague), and a very handsome but slightly deranged control-freak of a first-time buyer threatening to carry out Ozzy Osbourne style abominations on my favourite(!) estate agent. All was well by 4.30! I have the organised regimentary skills of Montgomery when I sat my mind to it!  I left just in time to get home to change and head out to the Head's party - picturesque riverside setting, flowing wine and a hot-tub in the garden - where else would a stressed girl want to be on an evening? A few people did sample the relaxing wonders of the tub - albeit in small groups - I joined Jack. It was fab! The result being that we are getting one - a family decision was made - my mum and step-monster are paying!  Saturday was supposed to be rock-climbing day - I made a token effort by putting on trousers, tailored smart ones, but that's all I have, and high-heeled mules - I dropped Jack and his Japanese chum off and then made off to the shops before my client had chance to haul my ass in a harness 12feet above him - not a facet of myself that I relish him seeing.  It was a frantic race back home to get changed into a bustier and new beaded poncho and then off to Leeds for Eva's hen-night - a very sophisticated affair made all the more traditional with the addition of a flashing "Bride To Be Sash", some handcuffs, a few sorry foam sexy(?) images and a pop-up willy disguised as a bottle of Instant Erection pills! Classy, tasteful, discreet enough to have at the table in Leeds swankiest eaterie - but still in keeping with the hen-party theme. I hope she was pleased with the result, and appreciated that I could quite easily have opted for the full-on mega-vibrator and blow-up doll experience!  Today was our final good-bye to Leeds shopping, or at least the experience we have enjoyed for the last 4 years -  get up late, take an age to have breakfast, hit the shops by about 2.30, get hot and tired with different agendas, find the Sunday papers and crash in a restaurant somewhere to sate our appetites and ease our feet - le Bistro de Jour being La Tasca, by the window in the afternoon sun.  I finally caught up with Jack by about 7 o'clock tonight - he's heading out to Spain in a couple of weeks  - later than I had expected and probably means I won't develop the sudden urge to book a last-minute holiday to relieve my boredom, by the time I've noticed he's gone, Eva will be back from her honeymoon and will be on the phone to tell me off for choosing to wear a corset at her wedding!
