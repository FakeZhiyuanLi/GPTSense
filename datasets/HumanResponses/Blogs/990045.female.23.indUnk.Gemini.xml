      (Read of the mo: The End of the Affair - Graham Greene)  Today just seems to be whizzing past. Haven't been exceptionally productive with so many things happening around here. Got out with Cheryl during lunch to get El's birthday present. Never an easy task, i finally found a handsome looking belt from Raoul which is really quite simple so that he has no reason not to like it. And since i've gotten the prezzie i've just called Arfah to cancel meeting up later for shopping as Shirley's needing some TLC from having finally paid her school fees today.... and ironically we're going out tonight to grab a few drinks (since its ladies night) to celebrate her lost of financial freedom.

      (Read of the mo: Save Me the Waltz - Zelda Fitzgerald)  The weekend has been a really busy one with Ivy's dinner party and Bird's hen night - which had to be put together all on 2 days' notice. It all started with Bird ringing late friday night freaking out about the whole getting married thingy with the wedding barely a week away. So i happily suggested having a hen nite to calm her nerves and she jumped at the idea. Problem was that with the wedding date so close, there wasn't really a good time to have the hen nite other than the immediate sunday. And so began the mad-race calling to hotels and escort agencies because Bird specifically requested for a stripper who looks like a cross between Brad Pitt and Aregon, with tight buns to boot. Though it wasn't like we really care about the sex she'll be missing out on after her marriage, it seemed like a fun idea to see how Bird would cringe and freak out when we present her with a half-baked stripper. Went to bed close to 3 that night after talking to them Bird and Arfah on Bird's 3-way phone.  Sat was hectic, meeting El for lunch at the s'goon food centre followed by a long drive down to the Expo. But the carpark was so crowded with people going there for the dumb car show (which should really be called the dumb cars and dumbass showgirls exhibition) and all we wanted was to go to some electrical appliances sale. We're so goddamn happening yeah? Anyways the queue for the lots were so long we ditched the idea and headed for Eastpoint instead, where El dropped me off to meet up with Bird. Proceeded to meet Yonghan shortly after to go to Ivy's place for her dinner party. Dinner was ok and we played mahjong for a bit. Scooted near midnight and got home early enough to yak on the phone for a bit with Bird, did research for the hotel rates and eventually ended up going to bed at close to 4.  Earlier part of sunday was filled with phone calls and smses with Bird and Dawn, debating about which hotel to go for. Finally decided on Le Meridien but it was close to 4 when we finally got our lazy asses to town. The presidential suite we got was so-so, but the bathroom was sure grand with a tv hanging above the throne. Watched SATC and Maid in Manhattan, fooled around for a bit trying to strip Bird without much success. Sham, Dawn and Shikin joined us in the evening and we pigged out and watched Serendipity, read and destroyed old love letters from that loser ex-boyfriend of Bird's, before erupting into a massive pillow fight with everybody going for Bird's pants. Ani and Sham left us at 1 and rest of us talked some more about Bird's new place before they decided to go look for food downstairs while i retired close to 4.30, mindful of the half day of work that i have to face today.  Alrighty, not quite up to writing or thinking anymore after an energy-depleting weekend like that. Am heading home to chill and catch Friends and then its straight to bed.  Check back.

      Second post today - this is a first!  Read and re-read this morning's post and feel incredibly dumb. I have started writing about things i precisely didn't want to write about, and the main reason i had deleted the previous blogs - too much negativity. I wish i hadn't.  Therefore, i am resolving to keep my blog free of negativity to my best ability. Negativity is bad, for me, for anyone who stumbles upon the blog, and the karma it generates is just way too much for me to handle.  Omm.....

      (Read of the mo: nil)  I should have been in hell of a cheery mood becos a) its a freaking friday b) i dun have to come in to work tomorrow c) my weekend's all planned out with people to meet and things to do and buy. But i am not, and i am pissed, becos a) its been too many fridays since i was allowed to feel this way b) i'm wasting my time getting pissed off and c) the damn giggles are just irritating the shit outta me. Yes, the fucking giggles coming from some inappropriately happy person, even for a friday. Except she doesn't limit her 'i'm so cute dun everyone just love the way i giggle oh wait maybe i'm not loud enough' fucking giggle to fridays, it happens almost on a daily basis!! I always wonder who's hanging on the other end of the line waiting for her to finish her giggling routine cos if someone i'm talking to on the phone starts breaking out into such a friggin giggle i'm gonna think i rang one of those ghost line and tell her to shut the fuck up and cut the line!!  Hell and its not just that, there's the weird accent that comes on whenever she speaks to anyone she can remotely fool into thinking she's a fucking american/australian/english whatever!! Like, duh! You are not IT, you dun look IT, so you dun try to be IT!! Especially not with your shifty eyes that make you look like a rat!!  Gosh i'm in such a fucked-up bitching mood today, and she has to go set me off like that, on a friday afternoon, no less! I am sure for all that evil and unkind thoughts that passed through my mind or even just those i've written is enough to get me karma-ded beyond redemption, but i cannot help myself. Maybe its PMS, and maybe its something else, i dunno. Maybe its because i've resorted to listening to Nirvana to block out the damn giggles, for which i'm not sorry for, cos if they irritate, they irrtate, there's simply no other way to look at it. Either way, i get irritated, i vent. And when i vent, i blog. I do not try to hit back by guffawing louder than she is trying to giggle and irritate the innocents. See at least i'm considerate, so Karma-mama, take that into consideration before you banish me to eternal hell will ya??  And as for you, you shifty one, i tried to be a friend, but it didn't work out. You just made it so much easier to loathe you simply by being what you are. And i've succumbed.

      (Read of the mo: yesterday's Straits Times)  Hmmmm.... bought meself and Cheryl some fish briyani for lunch, waiting for her to get out from her workshop so that we can tuck in. Meanwhile the smell wafting out from the bag is just making me salivate all over the keyboard yum!  Pretty bored morning doing nothing significant at all, and at the back of my mind there's that friggin board papers bugging me cos today's the deadline and if i dun do get it done something really bad's gonna come down on me. Arghhh this is such a nightmare every year.  I went shoe-shopping with Bird after work yesterday and it was pretty fun. So i guess i was wrong to assume everything i assumed earlier. Maybe she's not given up on the friendship like i thought. But we've still not spoken about what happen. Not like i'm that eager to talk about it. Actually i'm happy to forget about how she blew me off for nothing, well maybe something, but i dun mind not knowing what. I'm just glad things are somewhat back to normal.  Bali trip is off. Made plans to meet up with Gary and Yonghan at Ivy's place this sat, maybe for mahjong or something, we'll see what turns up. And then to town with Shirley for some shopping on sunday. Hee guess its not gonna be one of those chill-out-with-a-book kinda weekend.  Has got The Reason playing in my head so much, it keeps reminding of somebody.... not that the song means anything, cos there's nothing, and its precisely that which pretty much upsets me.

      (Read of the mo: nil - too freaking tired to read)  Had good lunch with Anita and Serene at pastamania. This is too indulgent i think i should be cutting down on the carbs. Still not sure if i'm going ahead with bali plans this week.  Got out of the office at close to 7.30 last evening and headed to far east plaza with Shirley to check out some shoes. Ended up in this lovely little dress shop that carried the prettiest 1950s dresses. The guy who mans the shop, who's really nice, even managed to convince my lazy self to try out one of the dresses, and i liked it so much i decided i want it before i even changed out of it. But that was of course after the guy incessantly telling me what a perfect body i hv to fit a dress like that.... i know, i know what a shameless ego trip huh its as if i was fishing for compliments twirling and turning in front of the mirror asking him what he thought but hey i needed that after having such a rough start to the week! Anyways the dress is high-waisted, white with pink satin trimmings and big pink flower prints and a really cute pink satin bow. Now now isn't that the perfect dress to wear to a day wedding? A wedding in a garden with lots of flowers and white flowy decorations.... hmmmm guess i will wear that to Serene's church wedding next month :)

      (Read of the mo: Pride & Prejudice, Jane Austen)  Wasted the whole of last evening at calfit talking to some hard-up consultants with Shirley. One of them happened to be her friend, whose manager is such an asshole he pissed me off within three seconds of shaking hands. You know the kind of people you decide doesn't deserve a chance before they even open their mouths? Yep he's one of them. He went on about an exclusive 'manager's promotion' that's only valid yesterday, which was nothing short of bullshit! Like, did he think we looked 4 or what?? But i was a good girl i gave him like 7 and a half minutes before telling him that he's crap. So of course Mr-I'm-a-manager got insulted and left, tail between his legs. Calfit sucks big time my love! And you would have to run me over twice with a bus before i'd pay you freaking money to join your freaking loser club again you bunch of hard-up assholes.  There, that was for delaying my dinner and making me miss Friends.

      Today is the day my heart breaks. Sappy love songs on the radio are not helping - they cannot mask the clattering of my heart breaking.  I wanna weep and ask why.  I know its only realistic for me to come to terms with it, and this is when every part of me aches knowing that it will never be.  So this is what it feels like. I should have known. Just what was i thinking?

      (Read of the mo: nil)  Its official. I am a big fat glut. No two ways about that. Spent like 3 hours at the buffet last night and ate our eyes out. And it wasn't like the food was that yum. I was just stuffing my face becos i was so pissed off at the way the whole week's turned out. And that was after trying so hard to control my appetite the past few days so that i can look ok in my bikini next week. Yeah there're like plans to go to bali over the weekend next week but now that the tickets are out i'm not so sure.  Anyways.  Dinner with Arfah and Bird on thursday night turned out ok. Things were not quite the same, but am not gonna dwell on it. I mean, its alright to move on, get married and have your own life. Who really wants to go back to the familiarity of a friendship that used to mean so much?? If friendships are meant to die out without a reason then so be it, i do not give a flying fuck. So yeah, feel happy for the impending marriage and only have best wishes for them. On the other hand, Arfah is so much the same, we can still talk the same way we used to babble at 13.... We are still evil plotters of really mean schemes.... we still regard men the same way they've been regarded since 10 years ago.... and we still don't give a shit about the 'cannot-make-its'!! Gosh did i tell you i love my girlfriends?? Arfah also brought news of Kok, a boy i used to go out with but have not seen for ages. And then there's Fauzi too - whom i spoke with on Arfah's phone. Hmmmm.... i cannot remember how dating feels anymore!  Over dinner yesterday, Shirley mentioned a treatment of a course of injections. The jabs work by killing the fat cells or something like that, and apparently its working for her friend, who tried 2 on her thighs. Isn't that like the bestest news this century? There's hope for us gluts yet!! Am gonna do some research over the net on the procedure, even think i've seen an article on it somewhere and the results are suppose to be quite permanent. And if all's well i'm gonna like jab like i've never jab before!! Bless them doctors who found this miraculous alternative to liposuction!!  Dinner plans tonight with the family and grams and aunts to celebrate father's day - for my dear ol' Pa-py! And then its my return to slumber-land for the rest of the weekend to make up for all that lost sleep over this bloody week. Catch up on some reading too and treat my hair to some tender loving dove!! Geeez i love the luxury of having time on my hands to do as i like!!  Taitai-dom taitai-dom oh where art thou??

      (Read of the Mo: nil)  One of the worst friday in history. Started the day by running into the last person i wanna see in the morning these days. Got rid of her by hopping into the really crowded train which she absolute hates, phew.... only to arrive at work to have to face some horrendous filing job and a reluctant co-worker who whinces and whines at every task. Already wasted about 1.5 working days this week assigning work and then repeatedly explaining simple tasks like filing in chrono order. And then feeling sorry and unsure if i should have assign such menial work. Then tried telling myself that he's young and hardly out of his teenhood but at same time also cannot help reminding myself that i was holding a full-time clerical job when i was at the same age. Judging by the number of wrinkles i've gotten this week i'm hoping that karma truly exists.  Know what's worse? Its a fucking saturday tomorrow and i have to work. Not only that, there's like a sodding workshop at 9 in the morning too! Which effectively means i have to get my ass into the office at 8! How about that? Having to smile and register the old fuddies like its my favourite thing to do on a freaking saturday!!  Life's a bitch.  Had planned dinner with Shirley tonight but she had to cancel bcos of work. But now we're going out again to stuff our face at the merchant court hotel buffet cos i'm so pissed off and she's decided to take pity on my sorry self. And having to bring her work home as a result....  I love my girlfriends!!  And may karma get all the stupid eejits in the world!!

      (Read of the Mo: Nil - finally finished the crap book call Man & Boy; which incidentally should be simply titled Dickhead instead, cos that's what its about)  Got a pep talk from the boss today for taking an extra long lunch. Was really out with Cheryl sorting out stuff for her new home. But its ok, not the first time caught slacking.  Am gonna head out for dinner tonight with Arfah and Bird. Yes, the pre-wedding meet-up kinda dinner. Having some mixed anticipation right now cos i haven't seen them in ages and i just dunno if things will be awkward u know?  Been trying to decide if i wanna get a Frank Sinatra compilation album....  Ok gotta fly now else i'll be late. Will check back later with details.

      (Read of the Mo: the fucking Man & Boy - real crap, only reading to see how much worse it can get)  Brought celery sticks to work for breakfast today and feeling like the healthiest person around, very pleased with myself =)  Real pain trying to get out of bed this morning cos i slept real late the night before talking to mom. Haven't had proper sleep the past week, and no matter how badly i resolve to get home early and be in bed by 10 its just not happening. Crap how i wish i dun have a job so that i can sleep for a living.  Yahoo's giving me like a 100mb email account and i'm excited cos i absolutely hates deleting emails and sms - laziness more than anything. But i wonder just how yahoo can afford to give such huge account space to all it users....  Better go, have got shitloads of work to face today.

      (Read of the Mo: still on bloody Man & Boy! Man this shit is boring me!)  Spent sunday doing absolutely nothing at home. Spent the usual 2 hours reading the sunday papers, did laundry, then took a long bath before settling down to watch The Hours on vcd. Show was not too bad, lots of suicides and depression. Not about to pick up the book again though.  Had a bad case of gastric attack today - which resulted in me taking a one-hour nap after lunch right here at work... hee it sure feels good to be slacking legitimately when everybody else are working their asses off!  Anyways Cynthia got in touch yesterday to tell me that she needs my help next june... yes you guessed it, andother wedding!! What is it with these people? Like is this the season to get married? And can they do it any other time? No! They have to do it just when my life is filled with shit and doubts and everything in that particular aspect....  Gosh where did all that bitterness come from?

      (Read of the Mo: Man & Boy - Tony Parsons)  Yes its hardly 11 but i've eaten 3 slices of yakun toasts AND a huge springroll. One of those days.... but for the sake of my ever-growing tum-tum i hope it passes soon! Am heading for kino after work with Anita and maybe even the EC for a bbq later. Don't quite feel like i'm up to it but i'd rather get out and do stuff... keep meself occupied.  Had one of those pointless arguments with El last night, and again came out of it knowing nothing stuck with him. Sometimes i wonder if i'm the incoherent one always ranting without a cause. Until i get eaten up from the inside knowing that i haven't tried communicating and that i'm pushing him away becos of all these things that i want him to know. And possibly change? I dunno. Not so sure if he will, not sure if he should. Actually not very sure of quite alot of things between the two of us. If i am braver than me i would have taken some time out to think about it and decide if its stay or go. But i am not. I need to keep meself occupied.  Also had a long chat with Renee late last night about some work thingy she's having with Jason. Her work, he cares too much, he gets offended, she gets offended. Sigh... sometimes the world would be easier if only people didn't care so much about each other yeah? Anyways she also mentioned some things that would have kept me up thinking all night. But i didn't. Guess it was just too emotional a night for me. Sometimes you just wanna shut off and feel nothing watching the world revolve around you, you know what i mean?  I'm not trying to be unnecessarily bitchy or selfish but i think i have a major problem with people who subject me to their kinda music. Especially when their kinda music is Its My Life at one-tenth its original speed.... bloody crime i call it.  Ok ok i had better stop myself. Don't wanna get, in the words of wise ol' serene, Karma-ded.  So there.

And you know how if you don't get em right in the morning you'll know that your whole day would just be shitty? I've been having shitty brows for like a week now so you can imagine what sorta week i've had =(  Just heard the loser song again. Its so loser its sad. What kinda guy wouldn't wanna know if you're 'playin' him?? Some masochist you have out there these days huh? But then I find meself playing the song in my head over and over.... its actually nice! Ok so i dunno who's the bigger loser now.  Later.

      (Read of the Moment: None - left half-read Man and Boy in El's car accidentally last evening)  Was in a particularly homely mood last night and so decided to hem the length of a new pair of pants. Bad idea. The last time I tried to hem Cheryl ended up asking me where i get my alterations done - just so that she could avoid the tailor. Some very encouraging company I keep yeah. But then i never learn and ended up having to surrender the piece of clothing to my mom for her to take it ot her tailor instead.  Made my way to work on the train with Daniel today. Daniel is a friend I made on one of the long trainrides i have to make to work every morning. It really kills time better than trying to read all the advertisements in Streats to make it lasts the whole journey.

      (Read of the Moment: Men and Boy, Tony Parsons)  Got rid of all my old posts today. Decided that if there's any good day to start a proper journal, today would be it. And the infrequent shit i posted in the past just isn't good enough. Too much negativity, you know what I mean?  Found out today that Carol has a blog too. But she's not telling me where, just like i'm not telling her where mine is. Interesting don't you think? We keep tabs of our life online by posting blogs, divulging our innermost thoughts and secrets, but freak out at the thought of having friends read them. Freak out at what friends may think of me if they had known how I truly feel about issues. Freak out at them forming their perceptions of me without me knowing. Is that what its all about??  Rained really hard today. Still trying to come to terms with news of Birdie getting hitched. Once upon a time we were giggly little girls who agreed that 28 was an ideal age for marriage. And then squirmed and exploded into laughter because we just couldn't imagine what getting married would be like. Like, marriage? Bah! And then plans change, i suupose. Still, i'm really happy about the way things are working out for her, cannot wait to meet Rizal.  But cannot help but wonder if its normal to get all emotional like that when you know a good friend has found someone to spend the rest of her life with. If its normal to freak out because you've not met anyone you vaguely want to wake up next to. If its normal to feel so repulse when I imagine marrying El.

      Read of the mo: nothing!  Am in a terrible state today. Throat's the worst it has been all week and it didn't help that i didn't sleep early last night. Was up talking to Fauzi on the phone and there were just so much to catch up on. He has been mia for a good 4-5 years maybe? Kinda glad to be getting in touch with so many people i've lost touch with.  Can't really think straight now, think i will head to the doc soon and then go home for rest. Check back prolly after the weekend.

      Read of the mo: zilch   I am still trying to fight off the flu. Am pretty amazed so far for not having succumbed to the virus. Left work early with renee yesterday and we ended up at&nbsp;new asia bar for drinks and chat. The paranomic view from up there was breath-taking and it was fun catching up after so long.&nbsp;She left close to 9&nbsp;while i hopped over to the jazz bar downstairs&nbsp;to catch Dawn sing and we had a short chat after she finished her set before i left for home. For someone who's trying not&nbsp;to fall sick&nbsp;i was feeling exceptionally fine :)   Still cannot quite figure out which dress to wear to Serene's wedding this weekend. Am just glad that i am finally getting this saturday off from work after having worked the past 2 sats. Made appointment to do my nails&nbsp;this sat morning at this new nails place at taka with shirley followed by brunch and then to kino to browse at new books. Hopefully have got enough time to get home early enough for a short nap before the wedding dinner else may just not be up to the party after&nbsp;dinner at anita's. Gosh sat looks really packed and i so cannot wait for the weekend to begin!

      Read of the mo: The Awakening   I still feel like crap. I didn't get better, but i didn't get worse either - which i should be glad for&nbsp;honestly. Afterall there are like 2 freaking workshops this week and i donch know what would happen if i have to take even a single day of sick leave. So in the meantime i'm just overdosing on all kinds of medicine i can find at home to make my sore, swelling throat feel better. Mom made me&nbsp;fresh oj last night and i went to bed&nbsp;a little after 10.   Went&nbsp;and visited renee at her store at the Mandarin after work yesterday. I know i know i was a sick person i was supposed to go home and rest, but i had to grab stuff from tangs and it was only in the area right? Anyways the Missy B shop was really nicely done up in lovely hues of pink and purple and the bags were gorgeous, all imported and hand-made but they cost about an arm and a leg and maybe an eye too - at a whooping 389 bucks for a little clutch! 'But this is a boo-taque!' renee exclaims. Oh well, taitai-dom taitai-dom you'd better find me soon!

      Read of the mo: zilch  Am feeling what must be the onset of a vicious stomach flu. Throat's really uncomfortable and am feeling so tired even though i went to bed at 8.30pm last night. Yes, 8.30, i couldn't even stay up to catch Friends, so have got my brother to record that and Extreme Makeover for me.&nbsp;My bones are aching all over and this morning i was retching so badly in the bathroom but had nothing to throw up cos i'd skipped dinner. God i hate falling sick, the last time i was sick like that i took more than a week to get better, and that was only a little more than a month ago. Gotta load up on them vitamin c.  Can't write anymore, will go rest for a bit&nbsp;and then its back to work, plenty of stuff to work on today.

      Read of the mo: The Awakening   Spent saturday evening watching season 2 of satc and had an early night, but not before i went and stop the police patrol car and told them about the re-appearance of little pervert guy since i couldn't reach the inspector earlier. Mom&nbsp;wants&nbsp;me to&nbsp;stop harrassing the police but hey, you can never be too careful right?&nbsp;Sunday was laundry day and went with Shirley&nbsp;to her favourite gadget hangout&nbsp;for a bit but had to get home early to face a mountain load of ironing cos i was seriously running out of things to wear to work.&nbsp;Ironing is such a tedious chore i've&nbsp;comtemplated hiring someone to come over and get them done but mom said no and told me i'm a lazyass. She said she'd rather i pay her to do it and even my aunt's offered but hell, the whole point of getting someone to do it is so that you can make a fuss if they don't do a good job right? And i can't possibly rail at my mom or my aunt in any circumstances so what sorta satisfaction do i get?? Arghhhh why can't the washing machine come with an internal ironing function? I mean it already has the spin-dry and some the dryer so it effectively cuts out one step of having to hang the clothes out to dry, so why not the ironing as well? So you inventors out there listen up, cos if ever there's such a machine i will be the first to grab one.   Gosh i think i am coming down with something maybe its the office flu, really don't feel too good.&nbsp;Bet its from all that ironing last night arghhhh.

      Read of the mo: Awakening   Last night was a horrid, horrid night. And it was a friday night. Bad things always happen to me on fridays, so&nbsp;my weekends are ruined before&nbsp;they even start.   Saw ivy on icq and she's just found out that she's 4 weeks pregnant :) She asked for company to catch&nbsp;a magic&nbsp;performance&nbsp; at night and thinking that i was up to it i actually agreed. I regretted right after that but was trying to be brave and supportive and so talked myself out of cancelling on her even after i got them tidal waves. By late afternoon i was feeling pretty upset already and&nbsp;Bird had to add to all that misery by telling&nbsp;me that The Importance of Being Earnest was showing on channel i at 10pm and by then i wanted to kick myself so bad.   Finally drag myself outta here at 730 and sulked all the way there in the cab. But was feeling this mini tinge of hope when i got there when i bumped into Anthony who was watching the same performance and thought this can't be that bad afterall. Turned out performance wasn't too bad other than that preaching bit at the end. Now the evening started going down the hill from there. First ivy left me with her weird colleague to walk out to get a cab when there isn't a single one out there cos everybody was trying to go home. So i had to call for one while trying to look entertained by weirdo who was going on about what a strange surname HE has. By the time i spotted my on-call cabbie half a mile away i was ecstatically flagging at it, eager to get away from motormouth and his surname. And then&nbsp;dumb cabbie took wrong side road and we got stuck in the most horrendous jam within the kallang carpark for a good half hour. I got kinda edgy with the driver and was feeling the cramps creeping back and I couldn't believe what my shot at being nice has brought upon&nbsp;myself.&nbsp;Was feeling so miserable&nbsp;sitting there holding my&nbsp;tummy&nbsp;and playing back the day's events i couldn't hold the tears in when they came.   But the worst was yet to be over. By the time i got to my block all i'd wanted was a hot shower, mom's soup and then deep deep slumber but i spotted HIM. Now he and i, we have a history. The history may have been longer than i&nbsp;know, but the first time i laid eyes on him he was standing outside my flat on tip toes trying to peer into the flat. I was trying to figure out what he was up to before i adressed him but he bolted before i got a reply. Maybe its to do with that fact that i had adressed him as "You fucking pervert what the hell are you lookin at". Or maybe he's just shy, i dunno. Anyways he was sighted a couple more times after i alerted my family to lookout for a short skinny and fair assohole with&nbsp;the most hideous&nbsp;one-lenth hair-cut. Until one fateful weekday night some months ago when i was out with el,&nbsp;and my brother and 3 of his friends were heading over to my place at 11.30pm and the crazy pervert guy was found loitering my corridoor. They cornered him, called me and i called the police, and by the time everybody got there it was looking like the set of some police drama! Turned out little pervert guy doesn't even live in the area, and he admitted to hanging round the neighbourhood for god knows what reason. Pity the police officers wouldn't let me have his name or address, maybe they thought i'd try to stalk him back or something, else i would have publicly shamed him somehow. Anyways back to last night, little pervert guy was circling the void deck in the most suspicious fashion u'd think he'd have learnt from having gotten busted the last time. I got kinda pissed off while waiting for the lift and was comtemplating telling him to fuck off but the lift came and i got home in one piece. Told mom and she freaked out and i ducked into the shower just in time.   Am gonna have to call up the inspector later today to tell him all about little pervert guy, but for now i'm just gonna make my way home for some snooze and hopefully a restfull weekend.

      Felt that familiar stab of pain in my tummy when i was out buying lunch today and it only got worse after i ate. Then came the dreadful crimson tide and by then the pain was eating me up from inside. Asked around for some painkillers and whoa! offers of panadols, ponstan and synflex poured in and i'm ever grateful, and am slightly surprised at the number of&nbsp;women who are on&nbsp;prescription painkillers. And to think i felt like i was abusing drugs when i was popping neurofen and sleeping pills like mad! Ha i'm so not alone in my battle against pain and insomnia ;)

      "I am looking for love, real love, ridiculous, inconvenient, consuming, can't-live-without-each-other love."  - Carrie, in the finale of SATC.   Just sat through what must be 6 episodes of the final season of satc and what can i say.... it is a great series and i will never get enough of it. Its heart-breakingly real, and makes me feel like i've lived it, am living it, and will live some more of it. Now if only all those dresses and shoes&nbsp;came along with the living.

      Read of the mo: The Awakening   Been thinking long and&nbsp;hard about my grand plan since yesterday and secretly feeling thrilled at having something to look forward to in life, despite tha fact that it may not even happen. I guess the biggest problem would be the money.... money for the tuition fees.... money to upkeep my lifestyle.... and then there's money for the mango stores. And so i've come with with a briliant plan to raise&nbsp;them moneh by getting my friends to perform crazy stunts on&nbsp;tv! They can either fly off a building, thread on clothing lines, eat cockroaches or something, and knowing the number of suckers out there just waiting to donate their lives away, i think there may just be enough to not only see me through my education but also&nbsp;leave excess for my original charity cause "Save Mango Fund". As for the performers, i've kinda tested the idea on&nbsp;Terence this morning and he's happily agreed to do something on the show like eating live rats as he doesn't like roaches much. I am feeling so blessed and i cannot wait for this to take off!

      Read of the mo: The Awakening - Kate Chopin &nbsp; Am in quite a sombre mood right now thinking about&nbsp;the conversation with Carol just now about&nbsp;my peers&nbsp;graduating from the U the past 2 weeks.&nbsp;I just had this sudden urge to quit my job and do my degree full-time. Maybe get a part-time job to pay the bills and all. It won't be easy, going back to the books after such a long time but i've always known i'd go back to school someday, if not now then perhaps in the future after marrying or something. Hmmm..... i wonder if i have the guts to make such a spontaneous decision like that.

      Read of the mo: The Awakening - Kate Chopin (real lit classic i'm trying to savour as slowly as i can) &nbsp; What a&nbsp;hauntingly sad&nbsp;song this is. Kinda makes me wish there is someone i like enough to miss! Hahahaha, as usual, what a silly thought. &nbsp; I Miss You - Blink 182 &nbsp; Hello there the angel from my nightmare the shadow in the background of the morgue The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley we can live like Jack and Sally if we want where you can always find me We'll have Halloween on Christmas And in the night we'll wish this never ends we'll wish this never ends... (miss you miss you) (miss you miss you) &nbsp; Where are you and i'm so sorry I cannot sleep i cannot dream tonight I need somebody and always This sick strange darkness comes creeping on so haunting everytime And as i stared i counted the webs from all the spiders catching things and eating their in sides Like indecision to call you and hear your voice of treason Will you come home and stop this pain tonight Stop this pain tonight &nbsp; Dont waste your time on me you're already the voice in side my head (miss you miss you) &nbsp; Dont waste your time on me you're already the voice in side my head!  (miss you miss you) &nbsp; Dont waste your time on me you're already the voice in side my head! (miss you miss you) &nbsp; Dont waste your time on me you're already the voice in side my head!

      (Read of the mo: nil)  &nbsp;  Have got this tune playing repeatedly in my head since i downloaded the audrey hepburn screensaver last week.  &nbsp;  Moon River  &nbsp;  Moon River, wider than a mile  I'm crossing you in style some day  Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker  wherever you're going I'm going your way  Two drifters off to see the world  There's such a lot of world to see  We're after the same rainbow's end--  waiting 'round the bend  my huckleberry friend  Moon River and me  &nbsp;  Saturday was a crazy day. Went shopping with mom and bought 2 pairs of shoes, got home in the evening and met up with Shirley after dinner. She had somehow managed to get her hands on her friend's car so we were driving around and&nbsp;got all excited when we found a pasar malam at sing ming rd, where i had my favourite taiwanese sausage before we went on to PS to catch Super Size Me at midnight, which is really a documentary on what 30 days of Mcdonald's food can do to you, your liver and your libido.&nbsp;Apparently Mcdees, which is what mcdonald's was called throughout the film, is highly addictive and if you don't give in to your cravings for that big mac or cheeseburger or fillet or whatever, you'll likely suffer from headaches and even depression! And the food also kills your livers (too much sodium?) and your sex drive, as testified by the vegan chef girlfriend of Morgan, the crazy dude on the 30-day mcdees diet, which just isn't something i'd readily buy, cos it came out all brief and unsubstantiated by any medical research, much like a passing comment. Like, if you're serious about making a point there, you would have done more to convince the audience you know. I mean, she is a fucking vegan! Oh well maybe i'm&nbsp;being mean, but ask a vegan how he/she likes&nbsp;chicken soup and he/she will cringe, much less processed meat like mcnuggets, so how impartial will they be when they have an opportunity to play a role in getting the world to boycott mcdees, a fast food chain selling not just many many burgers everyday, but also burgers that are made with meat and not some organic vegetables shit? Like, i'm totally not discriminating, but you just don't see people running around preaching about the harmful effects of consuming all that insecticide that comes from greens simply because they are carnivorous do you? Anyways, back to the film, i think&nbsp;it was done in a rather stilted view and i wish it hadn't been so cos it is really not that tough to prove how unhealthy mcdees food are, but they just went a step further and completely threw it off balance. Like, whats up with that scene of&nbsp;the double quater-pounder in vomit form?  &nbsp;  Right after the show, we did what i supposed must be unimaginable for many: we went to the drive-thru at east coast and ordered ourselves big fat nuggets at 2am in the morning :) and after a couple of hours driving around the supposed haunted roads in singapore, we ended up at the famous prata place in NUS and ate some more before we finally&nbsp;made our way&nbsp;home at 6am. Showered and read for a bit before i hit the bed at 7, only to wake up at 3 in the afternoon. Not my ideal way to spend a weekend, but it did make me cherish whatever was left of my sunday.

      Read of the mo: US People June 04  Went to bed early last night but got woken up when El rang from bali at 12.30am. Apparently he's lost his mobile phone at some cafe right after we last spoke a couple of hours earlier (during which he also mentioned that he's calling it a night and is on his way back back to the villa for bed??). The way it came out, he was obviously insinuating that he wouldn't have lost the phone if we had not had that conversation. Which happens to be a rather fond habit of his - that is, to blame me for every single misfortune that descends on him, no matter how absurd it seems. I was too fucking sleepy to do the whole "there you go happily blaming me again - why don't you go screw yourself" routine, so had just snorted and tried to sympathise. Then hung up and called starhub to suspend his line as he's asked, got back into bed and fell asleep immediately.  This sucks i know but i am giving up trying to make him stop because we've been through this enough times for me to acknowledge that he will never change. I suppose there are two kinds of people: the reasonable sort who realises that they have to take responsibility for their carelessness and stupidity and repent, and then there's the sort who sees everybody else as wrong and dumb, and therefore is to be blamed for everything bad that happens, because hell, how can anything ever be their fault? And El's the latter, if you're still wondering. And everytime i try to make him see sense he flips and tells me i'm the ridiculous one who's exaggerating, and i always, always end up thinking how stupid of me to have even attempted to work things out. That is how difficult it is to get through to the person i am seeing, have been seeing for close to 6 fucking years, and have absolutely no intention of ever marrying, not that it should be a concern at this point of time, but still. I dunno where that leaves us, honestly. Pains me to even think.  So that's it, am not gonna think anymore, at least for the rest of the weekend while he's away on another island and i can pretend that he doesn't exist in my life. In fact i've made plans to meet mom later to go to her medical check-up and then we're going shoe-shopping and then to the library for a bit of reading. And then its sleep-in tomorrow, doing the laundry and taking my own sweet time devouring the sunday papers. Perfect little chill-out weekend!

      (Read of the mo: nil)  Today is my brother's birthday and mom's cooking her famous fried rice for dinner, so cannot wait! Can't really put my finger on whats so special about the dish but i always end up eating 3-4 times more than what i usually have for dinner, which is really quite a lot. Speaking of dinner, Shirley and i had our favourite italian food last night and man it was sinful! The only way we could justify all that calories was to keep reminding ourselves of the hour-long intense shopping trip at MNG earlier. Anyways after dinner we ended up at Paulaners and beer did me good, and sleep came easy when i got home close to midnight.  Now it has been almost a week since my nasty accident with the damn bike in bali but my mangled little toe is showing no signs of recovery. Tried re-dressing the wound this morning but blood was still oozing and causing me so much distress trying to squeeze my big fat right foot into my pointy work shoes. I mean, i already tried coming to work in sandals but it's just not working out with my clothes.... and at one point i was seriously contemplating amputating my little toe cos its not like it has any functions being there anyway, and i'd probably fit better into the pointy shoes which i love. But then considered the pain and blood and thought it was a no go. Which technically means i'm still left with a mangled bloody little toe which i have to squeeze into a pointy shoe. So not happening lah.

      Today's one of those crazy days leading up to yet another workshop.... spent good part of the afternoon preparing the materials and totally forgot about the meeting with the designer of our corp brochure. The corp brochure is some stupid project thats been going on since forever due to many many dumb reasons of which pain me too much to list. Anyways, moving on, the past few weeks have seen us through what i thought was almost the ending of the project, but today the boss decided to call for opinions and what do you know, apparently its too small, too stark, too white, too maroony and too whatever :( i mean like, the designer's hardly the most exciting one around, but the amount of time and effort spent has just been way too much and i so cannot wait to see the damn thing go to print! Gosh the amount of re-working required.... i dunno who wanted to faint more after the meeting just now, me or the designer, but all i'm saying is i've laboured way too much on a single brochure and what a mediocre one at that :(  Okay enough griping about work. I'm heading out now for some food with Shirley and possibly dropping by the Art House to catch Ivy's performance before its back home to slumberland and then up bright and early for the darn workshop followed by another day of meaningless work okay okay i said i'd stop!

Arghhhhhhh.  Heard this song today and its almost like somebody wrote this for the tumultuous relationship with El:  Don't Wanna Think About You - Simple Plan  Can you leave me here alone now I don't wanna hear you say That you know me That I should be Always doin what you say  Cuz I'm tryin to get through today And there's one thing I know  I don't wanna think about you Think about me Don't wanna figure this out I Don't wanna think about you Or think about nothin Don't wanna talk this one out I won't let you bring me down Cuz I know I don't wanna think about you  Don't wanna think about you  When I wake up here tomorrow Things will never be the same Cuz I won't wait Cuz you won't change And you'll always be this way  Now I'm gonna get through today And there's one thing I know  I don't wanna think about you Think about me Don't wanna figure this out I don't wanna think about you Or think about nothin Don't wanna talk this one out This time I won't let you bring me down Won't let you shut me out This time I know I don't wanna think about you  Run away Run away Running as fast as I can Run away Run away I'll never come back again Run away Run away  Don't wanna think about you Think about me Don't wanna figure this out Don't wanna think about you Think about me Don't wanna talk this one out  I don't wanna think about you Think about me Don't wanna figure this out (figure this out) I don't wanna think about you Or think about nothin Don't wanna talk this one out This time I won't let you bring me down (bring me down) Won't let you shut me out (shut me out) This time I know I don't wanna think about you  Run away Run away I don't wanna think about you Run away Run away I don't wanna think about you Run away Run away I don't wanna think about you

      Okay, another second post in a day. Except i've actually been mighty productive today, even finished tomorrow's work :> Largely due to the fact that i haven't spoken more than 10 sentences since this morning.... hmmm it feels kinda liberating not to have to talk, make small chats, to communicate in general. I dunno if i'm really saying this but i kinda wish i'm deaf, dumb and blind. Eliminates all modes of communication, and all i'd be left with is peace, and i need only occupy my mind with me, me and more me, and none of that depressing negative stuff about people around. Hell looks like i'm on the path to becoming a full-on social recluse....

      Read of the mo: UK Glamour July 04  Past 24 hours has been hell for me. Left work past 9 last night trying to rush out the training materials for some workshop next week. If only someone had listened and started work on the programme earlier.... i mean like, i hardly ever start work on anything until i have to, but because of how complicated this workshop is, i've been reminding cheryl repeatedly since 3 weeks ago and no one even pretended to notice, cos they don't have to bear whatever consequences for churning out the programme late.  I am absolutely disgusted.  I couldn't stop thinking about how i have to get in here early today so that i can have everything ready by the time the printer guy comes. And what do you know, i got pissed off again and ended up with one of my foulest mood ever. As if its not enough i have been doing what wasn't my work, i was refused when i tried asking for help with what isn't even my work to start with. It can never cease to amaze me how fucking selfish people can be. And the saddest thing is when you regard these people as friends but all they care about is getting away with doing as little as they can.  I know i had previously said how i am gonna avoid negativity here, but if i try to avoid it anymore by not writing about it and as a result forget about it by tomorrow, it would have been like the ostrich sticking its head into the sand while a freaking truck runs over its ass above the ground.  As what an old acquaintance once said to me: be it work or play, always remember to put  Self Before Others .

      Read of the mo: Slave to Fashion - Rebecca Campbell (typical chick-lit that kept me entertained at the poolside over the weekend)  Bali was good. Had the loveliest time at the hotel poolside all on my own. And the mass of twinkly stars littering the midnight sky just blew me away.... right there in the middle of the open field with no street lamps or civilisation. And the wonderful little restaurant we went to on the last night had a live band playing really awesome salsa music.... everything was so beautiful and perfect i almost didn't deserve to be there.  Downside to the hoiliday was i got my little toe all bloody and bruised trying to ride the damn bike, and having it fell on its side as a result. Bikes suck ok, you'd never think they're that heavy! And i had to miss breakfast at El's client's villa on sunday because of my mangled little toe, which is still bleeding and purple btw.  Fortunes and misfortunes aside, the jarring fact of how we are so ill-made for each other kept popping up in my head - on an average of 6.5 times a day to be precise. His childishness, unbearable vanity and crudeness bugged me so much, much like someone giving you incessant jabs to the eyes. And you let him do that because you want to convince yourself that your eyes are made for jabbing.  I'm stuck in an emotional rut that i cannot get out of. I love jabs in the eyes i'm a self-destructive ejeet!!

      (Read of the mo: The End of the Affair - Graham Greene)  Another weekend flew by me again.... Bird's wedding took up most of sat and early sunday, spent last evening catching up with Sham and Shikin at dome in bishan after that. Briefly knew Shikin back in sec sch, but never really spoken till yesterday. She's married and a really underrated intelligent person. Fresh perspective of marriage and life in general. Love meeting people like her.  I was being difficult with El again on the phone last night. I got extremely mad at him when i told him how i'd wanted to meet up but he went ahead with his last-min dinner plans at some client's place anyway. Which really does sound quite infuriating. Except that (1) i wasn't really planning to meet him after the wedding (2) i dun really care who he has dinner with. Which really means that i was kicking up an unnecessary fuss, with or without him knowing. I hardly make sense to myself anymore. Not like i've been making sense all my life until now, but.... you get the drift don't you.

Boy's so pretty with fair skin and highlights in his hair, and he's so obviously gay. But hell, gay men are amazing they pay such immaculate attention to their looks.... hee its real pity hetro men are too full of testosterone to be bothered else us females would just have a wider variety of eye candy to feed our eyes on.

      (Read of the mo: The End of the Affair - Graham Greene)  Today's El's birthday, and we're going out tonight for a steamboat dinner. Bought him a nice rugged belt from Raoul yesterday and hoping that he will like it.  I like today. Nothing major really happened, and not even having to do lunch with some unlikeable figure could ruin my day. Mainly because i possess the ability to completely block out what i dun wish to hear or see. I honestly think it is an amazing talent that not everyone is blessed with. Like when Diana was being such a total pain in the ass at work, or when Ja-i-can't-even-bear-to-type-her-awful-name pretended she was a pesky 12-yr-old in new york. Oh wait, the pesky bit wasn't just pretending. Anyways, the point is, this is not about one of my many talents, but simply about what a nice, peaceful day this has been.  I've been thinking and i have a good mind to give up this blog for good. After the conversation with Bird the other day about the real motive of people keeping one.... its rather exhibitionistic don't u think? she say. Hell ya, even for me, who will readily admit to being the ultimate exhibitionist any day. More and more people are keeping blogs and all but a slight handful of them are down-right losers who are just keeping records of their pathetic lives online so that other losers could check them out and agree with each other that everybody knows that they have the most interesting lives. I hate being one of the crowd. And the more blogs there are out there, the more i see myself looking like one of them losers.  Anyways, until i get really bored of you, i'm still gonna be here.  Just wanna share a quick thought that's popped into my head 10 seconds ago: somedays when i get a blast from the past, and memories of how words played such an important part of my life, whether they came written, spoken, typed or even dreamed fill me with such comfort and happiness, feelings of having been understood.... i always wonder if i'd ever have another such experience with my extremely beloved chums from the past. These memories i cherish, and these friends i love.  And then i have to spend the night talking to El, who's on an entirely different frequency, who doesn't do the whole wordy connection.  Dang!  And the bestest news yet is Shirley half-thinks i should end up with him. Because you dun always meet someone who'd still be around after all these years. Yeah right! Like i should feel so lucky that he's not scooted yet huh?  My friend makes me feel oh damn so desirable y'know?

      Its 11am, and i am feeling an overwhelming sense of hopelessness.... everything i cared about at this time yesterday seems as significant as horse shit, its as if i had dreamed up a life. My life. I don’t wish to talk nor make any eye contact, and i feel an incredible urge to hide and stay really still. Human contact is just so revolting, i have no idea how I’d been able to put up with it for so long. Their meaningless chatter irks me so, their plain existence annoying the shit outta me. Wish i live in a vacuum devoid of this life form and their malevolent ways.

      Am listening to Jesus to a Child on the George Michael's Older album and it's so good it always gets me in a mellow and dewy mood everytime i hear it.... ol' georgie boy is simply orgasmic!  Last night saw shirley, terence and myself at calfit, rp branch. I hate to admit, but yes i've fallen into the clutches of them assholes at calfit again! I know what i once said about never ever stepping into that damn place again but hell, i just don't keep my word ok?? Anyhows, we were having dinner at bishan after that but i had to rush home cos SATC was gonna start playing at 10, all 8 glorious episodes of season 5. But guest what? The freaking ejeets at starhub decided not to activate the damn channel! After all the trouble i've gone to to get hbo on cable just so i can catch satc! The anger and disappointment was way too much to handle and i went to bed sulking.   Jesus To A Child George Michael  Kindness In your eyes I guess You heard me cry You smiled at me Like Jesus to a child  I'm blessed I know Heaven sent And Heaven stole You smiled at me Like Jesus to a child  And what have I learned From all this pain I thought I'd never feel the same About anyone Or anything again  But now I know When you find love When you know that it exists Then the lover that you miss Will come to you on those cold, cold nights  When you've been loved When you know it holds such bliss Then the lover that you kissed Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight  Sadness In my eyes No one guessed Or no one tried You smiled at me Like Jesus to a child  Loveless and cold With your last breath You saved my soul You smiled at me Like Jesus to a child  And what have I learned From all these tears I've waited for you all those years And just when it began He took your love away  But I still say When you find love When you know that it exists Then the lover that you miss Will come to you on those cold, cold nights  When you've been loved When you know it holds such bliss Then the lover that you kissed Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight  So the words you could not say I'll sing them for you And the love we would have made I'll make it for two  For every single memory Has become a part of me You will always be My love  Well I've been loved So I know just what love is And the lover that I kissed Is always by my side  Oh the lover I still miss Was Jesus to a child

      Some inquisitive noses in the office kept picking up wifts of the yummy-licious durian all afternoon. Some said its coming from the other offices within the building via the air-con vents and some even speculated that its durian-flavoured varnish coming from the office next door which is renovating. So when someone finally confessed to harbouring 2 boxes of them king of fruits we asked to share the loot or risk being exposed as by then the pungent stench has even got the director running out of her office and threatening to ban the fruit. The guilty one had no choice and so the 5 of us in the privileged loop held a durian feast on the rooftop whilst enjoying the awesome view of the swissotel across the road =)  Was sms-ing with daniel, my train-buddy all afternoon and discovered that we share the same birthday! How weird is that? As if there aren't enough split personalities geminis around, we even have to share the same birthday!

      Last weekend had been a productive one cos i made myself get out and do stuff. Ditched facial and shopping on sat and instead headed to the gym with terence for the first time after like two and a half months. Also managed to visit my brother and sis-in-law, saw I, Robot and Fahrenheit 911, and miraculously caught up on some sleep as well. Met up with shammy at the Max Brenner Chocolate Bar on sunday followed by her farewell dinner at newton's and boy, was it an emotional evening. Shammy's one of my closest bud since 15 and one of those friends i wanna keep for life and its just unfortunate how some things can screw up your life so much. Her final hearing's today and right after she will be serving out her sentence for at least a good 6 months and all i can do is write her letters to keep her head up. I honestly hope the 6 mths will fly by for her.  Sg idol last nite was a riot. It is beyond me how that many people on this island actually think they have talent, or, in the judges' words, the 'x-factor'. There was this nutcase who couldn't stop crying and then the psycho-looking dude doing his whispery rendition of careless whisper! But what got me laughing so bad i fell off the couch was the ricky martin wannabe who was prancing suspiciously close to the judges while stripping down to his obscene yellow trunks! Talent: -5 / Entertainment value: 101!

      Insomnia found me again last night for the first time in a long, long while. I think it knew what was troubling me, and it couldn't have came at a more appropriate time. I was kept awake until almost 3, and the sheer agony of trying to push this big, exasperating issue outta my head and letting nothingness take over my mental state of mind was killing me. Maybe its just a case of meeting the right person at the wrong chapter of my life? I dunno, its really too early to tell and besides there are endless impossibilities. But what if the wrong chapter doesn't ever close? What happens to all the possibilities that may be? Errr ok i think i am being incoherent already i'd better move on.  Was catching up on the goss with arfah over coffee last evening and its apparent how we've all gotten on with our lives separately but its uncanny how we're dealing with the same few issues. And so many things have not changed between us we still like to people-watch and discreetly check out the hotties while pretending to be engaged in some political discussion =) now that was the kind of fun we had since we were 13.  Cannot wait for 1230 when i can leave this damn place and head to wisma with carol to shop for lovely clutch bags. Then will be off to meet shirley for facial appt at 2. Am gonna take it easy for the rest of the day and hopefully the weekend while the nation celebrates national day.

      Read of the mo: The Awakening  My weekend couldn't have started better. Took an almost empty train to work today and had a pleasant walk from the station. For some reason the air was fresher, the sky's brighter and the trees greener! Days like that make me wanna go lie down right in the middle of padang and just feel the proximity of the earth and the sky.  Met ed at the space city bar for a drink yesterday. He's going through some low-risk investment plans for me and was telling me how the shares market works and it was really quite interesting. Imagine the fund managers' responsibilities when entrusted with millions of dollars by their clients and every decision they make to sell or buy will either make or break somebody's investment. As unlikely as it may sound, isn't that quite like a doctor who performs lives-saving surgeries on patients? Except the ultimate stake in question maybe be a life, in place of well, money. But how different are they really? You lose your life, and you won't need money. You lose too much money, you might as well not be alive.  Oh well it is a friday and i am bent on making the most out of the long weekend ahead. Have no idea what i am going to do really but guess i will take each day as it comes. Been feeling rather unsettled of late about something, but i don't really know what it is. Not really trying to find out actually. But its when i see everybody else trying to make something out of their lives, i feel like i oughta do something too. The first thing on the list is that english degree but there are just so much hurdles and difficulties i've been skirting the whole issue for ages. I really oughta push myself a little harder 'else before i know it i'd be a 40-year-old still thinking about doing it. Maybe i just need the weekend to sort things out with meself.

      Woke up to the damn alarm this morning but couldn't make myself get out of bed, so was staring at the ceiling for a good 30 mins before i dragged meself to the bathroom. Was horrendously late by the time i got out but sat self down in front of the tv and made a yummy fish fillet sandwich. By the time i got my face and my hair and the clothes and the shoes done it was 8.30 - official time i'm suppose to start work! Still couldn't make myself walked any faster in my new heels and strolled in to work at 9.15. But it was all good it feels much like a friday here and since the boss is out i'd been desk-hopping just catching up ;-) and thinking i'd take things easy for a bit today. And then i got an email from shirley who circulates this daily horoscope thingy to our friends on the gemini-network:  GEMINI (May 21–Jun 20): You are, as usual, tempted to take things light and easy today, but it's not going to work as well as you would like. You are more emotionally charged now, but you can get totally confused by your feelings. It's difficult to separate the logical and rational thoughts from their emotional origins. Let yourself merge with the irrational without fearing what may happen.  So what now?? I know i have been more emotionally charged the past couple of days about so many things.... there's work, there's people and then of course there's the whole issue with el. And i so totally cannot decide if i should listen to the head or the heart on everything, and now the stars are telling me to throw all cautions to the wind??? Weird!! Was just on the line with bird all of last night yakking about stuff and she again bugged me about the tempting fling offer from her husband's friend.... now could that be what the whole 'merging with the irrational' bit meant? That dude's supposed to be perfect fling material.... too perfect in fact cos he's married.... but i dunno, isn't that like morally incorrect? The whole el issue, and then there's like the karma to worry about. I dunno man, i guess i'm just over-analysing everything, as usual.

      Had real trouble getting out of bed this morning and got to work even later than usual. Didn't manage to catch no show yesterday and got home early, but had gone and met up with shirley and terence for coffee at 10. Got home and fell asleep immediately.  Find myself still dwelling on what the boss said two days ago. I think its affected me more than I thought possible. Afterall I didn’t think I would ever be disappointed if I don’t harbour any expectations. Now I know how wrong I was. I never expected to be stood up for, precisely because of what I’ve seen and learnt the past 4 years, but never did I think I’d be asked to be more pro-active about doing something that is so blatantly somebody else’s job. Pro-active my ass. How can I ever be good enough if the ceiling for maximum performance gets lifted all the time? And I think he’s seriously crossed the line this time. There are two things I can do: pretend that nothing happened and be rudely shocked the next time he blames me for not reading their minds or something, or change my working attitude and start doing only the bare minimum thats required of my position. If I don’t try to reach beyond what’s my responsibility, I will never be blamed for what’s not my job, right?  That’s it – my job scope has never been clearer. To hell with commitment and shit. I am starting to feel the true worth of every dollar I am paid.

      Second post today! You must know what's going on ;-) Been sms-ing with daniel all morning discussing what makes a politically correct movie to catch on the second day in a working week but we didn't get no conclusion. May just meet shirley for a movie or even gym after work today.  Been playing this over and over.... think its on the spiderman2 ost:  Vindicated Dashboard Confessional  Hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine of it has caught my eye And roped me in So mesmerizing, and so hypnotizing I am captivated, I am...  [Chorus] Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right Swear I knew it all along And I am flawed But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself  So clear Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intention Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye And rendered me so isolated, so motivated I am certain now that I am...  [Chorus]  So turnUp the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away [3x] So let me slip against the current So let me slip away [4x]  [Chorus]  Like hope Dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption...

      I. Hate. My. Job. I seriously do. At this point i really don't know what i came back here for. The boss's partiality is so in-your-face i almost burst into laughter when he started on all that shit about proactivity. Like, whoa, maybe i do get paid many times better than everyone else which explains why i have to take over all that "proactive" responsibility, even when we're talking about taking the initiative to remind everyone else to do their work?? The way he said it got me feeling so surreal, and i was looking at him thinking to myself, surely he didn't just say that?? I was so gobsmacked, i wasn't even able to react. But on my way home yesterday i couldn't stop thinking about it and all i'm saying now is this corporate culture shit is pissing me off bad and i am seriously gonna sit down and have a re-think about why i bother at all.  And as a result i find myself taking my own sweet time to get to work this morning when i bumped into daniel. He appears to be yet another jaded worker much like myself and he said something about going to work each day without a soul, and god knows how true that rang for me. Hell but at least the day didn't start off with another monotonous train trip, for which i am glad. And have been frantically making plans with shirley this morning to do a facial and hit the beach this coming long weekend. This is what happens when you no longer care what goes on during the day on weekdays because the fucking company dosen't deserve it anymore.

      "It's just another manic monday, I wish it was sunday, 'Cause that's my fun day, My I don't have to run day, It's just another manic monday" -- 'Manic Monday', The Bangles  Yes that pretty much sums up my morning. And boy am i glad its finally lunchtime and as i type away i am tucking into lunch that i packed from home - last night's dinner actually - but it sure is yummeh! Mom's even packed my favourite cod fish... think i oughta bring lunch to work more often.  Sat was a hectic rush like i expected. Got up real early for the manicure appt and it was raining so hard i had half the mind to go back to bed and live with ugly nails for the weekend. We miraculously got there on time and by 12 noon i had such pretty nails i was glad i came. Some serious shopping followed after a quick lunch and we finally ended up at far east where shirley bought a bag from a nice funky shop that sold mostly gay-ish apparel. Weird thing was how the guy tending the store and i found each other so familiar but we had no idea where and how have we met before! We were scratching our heads so bad but finally gave up after like 10 mins, but not before i managed to wrangle a 15% discount from Paul - thats his name - and he sent me an mms later that day telling me how he think we might have met at a club about 5 years ago! Hell that made me feel so much older than i really am....  Serene's wedding dinner on sat was nice, the usual chinese wedding banquet that starts a good half hour after it was supposed to have started, but then again i was late so no harm done. Was stuck at a table with erm... older people, so was really bored outta my head and trying to keep meself entertained with nicole's adorable little girl. But boredom got to a point where anita, cliff and i, who were all scattered at different tables, started messaging each other plotting on the perfect timing to make our getaway to some party anita's friend's having later in the evening. We finally took off at 1030 before the banquet ended and headed for the party at some fancy bungalow in the bt timah area. The party was great and aptly named Viva la vida Vodka cos vodka everything was just flowing! And there must had been like 40 people in the house and most of them i met were really friendly people, but of course by then i was suitable intoxicated to assume that everyone was being friendly :) Was chatting with this aussie bloke who works for P&G and freaked out for a bit but he turned out ok and we talked a bit about the place. He was even nice enough to give me a ride home later on and i crashed after a quick shower.  Saw The House of Flying Daggers yesterday with el and quite enjoyed it, even though it was said to be a flop with zhang yimou's attempt at a commercial flick. The cinematography was great, lots of nice autumn scenes and the story made me wept like shit. I know i know, such a sucker for tear-jerkers!
