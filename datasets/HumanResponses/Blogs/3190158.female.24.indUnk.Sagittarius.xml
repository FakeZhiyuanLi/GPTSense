         Ah  urlLink Drambuie .  You can make many fantastic drinks with this mysterious liquor.  My dad drinks Rusty Nails (Drambuie and Scotch).  I just love the name.  Drrrraaaaammmmbbbuuuiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeee.  It kind of reminds me of being on the  urlLink Orient Express , though I have no idea why.  Give it a whirl when you have a chance.

         It's been brought to my attention that i haven't given any pearls in the past few days.  Here are some: a) Don't be surprised if someone gets pissed off if you tell him/her that you're "worried" about him/her.  This is like saying "By the way, I think you're crazy, would you like the number of the shrink my cousin goes to?" b) Going as Siamese Twins for Halloween is not the best idea because of various bathroom issues and what if one of you wants to hook up... c) If you're getting cramps in your toes, you probably need more calcium.  Have some yogurt.

         Tomorrow begins the  urlLink Coachella Adventure .  It's going to be ridiculous.  There will be much dancing and merry making.  I'm going to count the number of people wearing  urlLink Von Dutch  hats.  Here's some  urlLink line up buzz .  Clearly, this is not the last word, but it gives us an idea.   So, I only packed the essentials, tank tops t-shirts, shorts, pants, fleece, bathing suit (my mother always told me to pack one cause you never know) a flashlight, sun block, a hat, 6 mini bottles of rum and a cigar.  Only the essentials.  Am I missing anything?  Since I'm often an ass, I booked myself on a flight that gets me into LAX 7 hours before my friends.  It looked like I was headed for a screw driver marathon (airport drink of choice unless I'm at the Chilis in Termainal A in Atlanta, then it's a margurita) in the  urlLink Delta Crown Room . This worried me slightly because not only was it highly likely that I'd pass out and miss my friends, but what if my game was off and I made a fool of myself on the putting green?  This is why I love  Delta .  They know how important it is for me to stay on top of my game, even when I'm traveling.  Instead my buddy Larry is picking me up and I'm going on location with him while he shoots footage for a TV pilot.  Obvioulsy, this translates into my dream coming to fruision: Claire Catherine --Super Star, you know, cause I'm going to be discovered. Cheers Larry!  Today, I love  urlLink Dizzee Rascal .  You should too. So who is everyone psyched to see this weekend?

      I was hanging out outside the Subway yesterday. Here are some highlights:  1) If you stand too long in one place, you'll be accosted by unthinkably annoying post-grads trying to sell hair-cuts and soalon treatments. I always thing they're asking for directions. They say things like "yippee" and have no concept of personal space and when you decline their offer they'll try to entice you by saying you can get a foot massage by a really hot guy named Emanuel.  Thank you, no.  2) I saw three monks (and not at the same time) and a Russain Orthodox priest.   3) There are an insane amount of French people on the UES. 4) Don't ever stand near a garbage can.  People miss. 5) Full on domestic arguments are mint. If you sitck around long enough, you're sure to catch one. 6) A really hot guy with a deconstructed jacket (what are you doing above 14th st?) who was also cooling--I feel like we shared a moment.  Did we have a meaningful conversation and I was too drunk to remember?  Are you famous?  Call me.

         Aren't these lyrics great?  A little band called RANCID penned them.  I heard this song yesterday and I was reminded of how much I love it--and that in 1995, I listened to ska.  You should go and buy the  urlLink album ... I mean look at this guy's face it's like he's screaming " I know the what's up," without saying a word.  Not a word.

         For those of you who don't know,  urlLink Jessica Simpson  is super-ultra-mega.  Not because she makes a mint selling stupidity and not because she has huge breasts; I love Jessica Simpson because she peddles something called  urlLink Belly Button Love Potion .  How fabulous is that?  Check out her new line of  urlLink edible beauty products , you know you need Chocolicious Body Gloss .  I'm going to Sephora right now to pick some up becuase  I'm full of sweetness and desire and I don't mind getting my hair a little messed up in the name of seduction .

         On this day in 1521,  urlLink Ferdinand Magellan , the first person to circumnavigate the Globe, was killed in a tribal dispute on the Island of Mactan in the Philippines.  Magellan was a contributor.  We can thank him for naming the Pacific Ocean (meaning calm and soothing) and for discovering the Straits of Magellan (funny how they have the same name).  We miss you brie.

      We were intrigued by the mini burgers offered by  urlLink Sassy's  on 3rd and 86th.  It seemed like a good idea to try them cause in the event that they were good, it would have been a life changing experience; kind of like what happened when  urlLink Coldstone Creamery  moved in up the block...  Well Sassy's Sliders (apparently, Sliders is a synonym burger) weren't very good. They were mealy and sweet. The fries were ok (but only the plain ones, the garlic were strange). All of this made me really sad as I was looking forward cute little mini burgers made from fresh-ground serloin and homade, handcut fries. Thank God  urlLink Everwood  came like a bright, shining star to light up my telelvision or I would have had to cry, I just can't take that kind of disapointment.  There is no reason to go to Sassy's.

      Lately I've been realizing how fabulous the Subway truly is.  There's so much to do there. You can get your haircut, your shoes shined, if you space out and forget a birthday gift, you can buy one at the bobble place in the Lexington station.  Also, there's the hot guy factor.  There are always hot guys on the  green line .  Always.  And sometimes, they speak different languages which is always fun (look for the Germans at around 7 b/t 59th and 86th). Hot guys are also to be found on the  red line  below 50th but NEVER above 50th.  You'd think with all the Columbia students there'd be some nice viewing material, but you'd be wrong. If you're like me, and always wear sunglasses you can stare virtually undetected--it's a great way to start a morning.

          So Lauren and I have just spent the last 53 minutes and 45 sec on the phone as she's coached me through the finer points of html coding.  I still have no idea what I'm doing but at least I can put in pictures and there's now a comment section.  Big ups to Stelz, for being a super,-ultra-mega geniac, big hearts and backslashes to you.

         This weekend was fairly ridiculous. We bid adieu to Felix on Friday and for those of you who weren't there, I did in fact cry.  What was so funny about that though is that everyone thought I was faking and they were like shit, Claire Catherine, you don't have to be such an asshole. And I was like right, like I would ever be an asshole.  So we danced, Felix drank Bushmills, I sang Jam on It, the police didn't come, we weren't mobbed by a thousand srceaming fans (one of our friends is an international television super-star, so these things tend to happen)--it was pretty succesful. Saturday was just amazingly gorgeous.  It would have been the perfect day for the opening of  urlLink Tom Collins Season , but the weather man lied and since my preciance doesn't extend to meteorology-I had no way of knowing.  So the Season will have to start sometime in May. Since it was such a nice day, we went to Pastis. There was some discusion in the group about whether or not we'd get a table since we (and by we I mean I) couldn't be bothered to make reservations, but our brunch karma was point on and they had a table waiting just for us right when we arrived.  We had French 75's (with congac, not gin) and a variation on a gin fizz which tasted exactly like an egg cream--but with gin.  I highly recomend ordering one of these tasty beverages next time you're there.  Oh and I saw this guy wearing fatigues with a pin striped sport coat--it was amusing.  We walked off our brunch in the West Villiage and went back to Lauren's to have cocktails on her roof deck, but we didn't make it passed the couch so instead we watched a very important episode of Nova and fell asleep. Then it was time to feed again.  We decided to meet Nav and Dr. Michael at Blue Ribbon Sushi.  Obviously, the wait was two hours so we decided to go around the corner for cocktails at a French cafe.  Then we went over to Blue Ribbon for drinks and oysters--then back to Blue Ribbon Sushi where we ordered an insane amount of food and many bottles of sake.  Then we went to bar and this crazy guy started freaking out and screaming at his girlfriend saying how could she accuse him of hitting on me and she was like what are you talking about and then he threw a pool cue into the middle of Thompson street.  So we left.  Not of course before running into the Aussie who was all like "let me buy you a drink, sweetheart, blah blah blah..."  Thank you, no. Then we went to sing. Nav and I sang Sweet Homa Alabama.  Danny was being ultra cool on Saturday--he let me sing that song even though someone else sang it earlier in the evening, and I didn't even have to threaten him.  Then it was time to go home....or was it?  I realized at around 60th and 1st that I was without keys.  My desperation got the best of me and I had a nice lay-down on the sidewalk in front of my appartment--I was fully prepared to sleep right there but Nav suggested we just get a hotel (he went to Brown so he's full of good ideas).  So we decided to head over to the Hilton.  Apparently we weren't looking so good cause when we asked for a room, they called security.  Then we were going to go to the Four Seasons-but I think we forgot becuase suddenly we were headed for New Jersey.  I had never actually been to Jersey City except to drive through it on occasion so I was pysched to be able to cross that off my list of things I want to do before I die.  The Path station there is really cool too.  Lots of neon.  I feel like this weekend was alot funnier when it was happening than it is now and I don't know whether it's because I was too drunk to remember or becuase any of the really funny stuff I can't post because it would get people (namely me) into trouble. I'll have to work on that.  Maybe next time, I'll just make stuff up. Everyone should watch Daddy Day Care.  You wouldn't think so, but trust me you'll be glad you did.  Also, Ernest Goes to School is a quality film.  I've seen several Ernest movies over the past few months and they never disapoint. And clearly, I've done nothing to inhance this blog cosmetically, but it's on the tippy top of my list, right below finding out what movies are new at blockbuster and finding out whether the mini burger place that opened on 3rd Ave is any good.

      ok so until i get one of my poindexter friends (aka nav) to help me with "script" and "templates," my blog is going to be a little ass.  but i'll figure it out.  see i already figured out how to create a "title." i'm on my way.... be fabulous this weekend

      so clayton is already asking me what my blog "does." honestly i wasn't aware that a blog had to "do" anything.  i suppose some (or all) are dedicated to hipster indie rock or the LES or there's even one about this  urlLink real, live girl who has gall stones and lives in arizona .  really, how can i compete with that? and anyway, i think the title is pretty self explanatory, it's the what's up.  i've already gotten some e-mails about my new blog and it's only been like 45 seconds.  ok so granted they've mostly been to the tune of "you're a loser cc" or "How to be the Biggest Loser in the World" by Claire Catherine Brown.  but whatevs, you know you're going to read it anyway. as for a comments section, i'm still trying to figure that out. as well as how to post pictures etc. so my page (life)doesn't look like a vapid wasteland (oh wait isn't that why i started a blog?).  in other news: felix is leaving for sf on saturday.  so come down to junnos and toast him with a glass of bushmills, you'll be glad you did. (as an extra bonus, you can watch me cry.)  pearls of wisdom for today include: don't take an iq test on the internet, it'll only make you feel bad about yourself.  if you like a guy/girl, it's a good idea to know how to spell his/her name. and as always, never let the fat hoes get you down.

       This post is mad messed up.  Just deal.    I know everyone has been eagerly awaiting the stories from the Skynyrd show last weekend but I wanted to wait till I could post some pictures...more to follow.  FYI to see the framed pictures, right click on them and chose "Show Picture" why it's doing this, I have no idea.   It doesn't take a red-neck hopped up on Wild Turkey and speed to know that Skynyrd rules.  Their fans are some of the liveliest of any band anywhere. We met a family that had three generations with them.  It was moving. We totally represented the South too.  I wore and Alabama t-shirt (Roll Tide!). The J Bizzie had on a Tennesee shirt and Elaine was representing the Lone Star State. As is tradition with any trip to A-town, we stopped at   urlLink Yocco's  where, for the first time in 20 years I changed my order and found  love  for the  LOVE  BURGER.  Very fabulous.  When we arrived in Hershey, we immediately started setting up camp.  We brought a cooler filled with beers and Jack; chips and salsa. And of course "the box" with a full arsenal of Skynyrd tunes to jam out to during our tail-gate fiesta. Half way through .38 Special, we finshed our drinks and headed into the show.  But we were stopped by security because Elaine had a camera.  But it was cool cause we were just like, looks like we can have another beer on our way back. Here's the part where we ran into "the crazies" (we never have an adventure without them) These guys approched us (one was wearing a t-shirt that said "Girls Lie") and started some drunk small talk.  "Girls Lie" guy is blathering on about something and every other word out of his mouth is "tits." Then he procedes to introduce us to his "brother" who isn't really his brother but you know...  Apparently, they're still "brothers" even though the one guy SHOT the "Girls Lie" guy in the leg.  Oh yeah. They were drunk and playing with guns.  These things will happen.  So the "Girls Lie" guy turns to the other and says, "ya know, I coulda sued you..." and the other guy says, "You did sue me...." "Yeah, well I coulda sued ya for more....and that bitch wife of yours..."  And about now we're just staring at eachother trying not to laugh and these people. Finally, they went away and we laughed and decided going back the car had been more than worth it.    The show was awsome I screamed and  sang throught the whole thing.  J-man and I danced to "I know a Little." I flashed the peace sign a bunch and when my lighter broke during "Simple Man" (and of course I was crying cause that song always makes me cry) this nice guy gave me his so I wouldn't be without one for Free Bird. It was a real coming together. The crown chanted USA-USA as large shirtless men wrapped in American Flags ran around the audiance.  They wre selling cotton candy in the stands (only in PA).  It was the greatest.  They played most of the songs I wanted to here.  They played "MCA" and "Travelin'Man" which was just ridiculous. Skynyrd Rules.  Everyone should go to a Skynyrd show.  I'll be damned if it doesn't make ye a better person.

       Bachelor # 1. "Well Rounded aka the Straight Shooter"   I'm a young professional living in NYC who enjoys going out. I like trying new restaurants and checking out new hot spots in the city. I try to be fairly active on the weekends. I like to get up early and not waste the day. I love to work out and have recently become a bit of a health nut. Althuogh I still do love to indulge at times too. I like hanging out in big crowds (with either my friends or other people's friends) but also enjoy spending time with a girl over a bottle of wine and a movie or with my good friends just kicking back a few beers. I'm a pretty easy going guy and a straight shooter ...at least I'd like to think.     Always looking for more people to go out with and have a good time. On the lady front, I'm just interested in meeting some cool girls. Especially interested to see if there is a girl out there with the same likes as me and is just cool to hang out with. Not sure if I'm ready to settle down but if its right, its right.    Bachelor #2: "I Look Good on Paper, Here's My AIM Address, Oh and P.S. I'm a Total Asshole"   I'm about graduate from Columbia with a BS in EE and from Williams with a BA in History and Physics... not bad for 5 years of work. At the beginning of August, I'll be moving down to DC, where I'll be attending George Mason Law School for the next 3 years.  I'm an INTJ, with all that entails...   I think my friends do a much better job describing me than I do.   Feel free to hit me on on AIM - if you'd like to engage me in conversation.      Bachelor #3 "I'm In-Touch with an Italian Artist which Makes Me Cultured and Desirable, Now Let's Screw"    "If he wants to give the situation narrative form, he will have to organize all the elements at his disposal in a narrative progression borrowed from the literary tradition. Having thus seized the language of a situation in which human relationships are distorted, betrayed, and, generally speaking, in a state of continuous crisis, he is led to organize it according to a narrative convention that automatically masks its true fragmentary, dissociated nature with an appearance of continuity and order" (Umberto Eco, The Open Work).

          p> I used to go out with this guy who was friends with Michael Bolton's daughter and consequently, spent some time at the Bolton home. Apparently, Michael, not only is a social activist, but also has quite a collection of busts...of himself. What a Jackass. Just a minute ago, I was staring at his face thinking, "hmmmm except for the hair, he's really not that bad looking...chisled features..." then, I realized that I was just really hungry and therefore not in my right mind. Still though, I think that makes me a Jackass.  Kenny G (aka Kenny Gorelick) has sold like 50 million albums.  I assume these albums were bought by foreingers. He plays like 20 different instuments, but then again, so does Prince who's beyond cool.  Could it be that Kenny G is trying to steal Prince's persona?  Check it out, he even grew some stubble.  FYI Kenny, not shaving for a week doesn't give you street cred, and don't even attempt pulling off no assed jeans, it's not going to work.  Jackass. These two Jackasses are playing two shows at Jones beach...TOGETHER. I think they're calling it EASY LISTENING AID.

         When  this season of Everwood ended, I didn't think I could go on. Could there be life after Ephram?  I thought not, but amazingly, I was wrong.  The WB came through in a clutch and gave us  urlLink "The WB's Superstar USA" .  It's pretty much the best reality show since The Surreal Life. And, ToneLoc is in it so, I mean, if that doesn't scream BEST SHOW EVA, I don't know what does.  There's another episode on tonight.  I, of course will be glued to the tube.  Will Randy realize his dream of becoming Britney Spears?  Will Rosa say something coherent? Will somebody ask about the Anglo Assassin? I'm going to find out.

          urlLink Jack Daniels , JD, Gentleman Jack, John. This beverage has more monikers than Ol' Blue Eyes. Jack Daniels is Today's Featured Liquor for obvious reasons (Skynyrd mentioning whiskey in at least 80% of their songs being the obvious reason). You can do so many things with this liquor.  You can cook with it ( urlLink Jack's Holiday Whiskey Balls )you can sterilize medical intruments with it, you can trade it for land, hell, you can even drink it.  Here are  urlLink 124 drink recipies  calling for Mr Daniels.  My favorites are the  urlLink Pass Out  and the  urlLink Deer Killer. .  But really it's best swilled straight from the bottle in the back of a pick-up with good friends...and of course, Skynyrd.

          urlLink Lynyrd Skynyrd  is the greatest Southern Rock band ever, and they're one of my all time favorite bands. We're heading out to see them in Hershey, Pa. this weekend.  We thought there would be a party bus taking all the Hill-Billies out there (and J tried his best to find it)but alas, there was none to be found. So we're just going to drive and have to put a cap on our "poison whiskey" comsumption.      It's going to be awsome. I will be listening to nothing but Skynyrd till the concert tomorrow which will annoy my co-workers but whatevs. Jarratt and I will be rooting through our closets trying to find our old Skynyrd T-shirts.  But in case we can't, I have a back up.  Last year I made a "Re-Birth of the South" inspired 4th of July T-shirt.  It says ALABAMA on the front and I wrote Roll Tide on the back of it in red sparkles. I also put ribbons on it.  It pretty much rules.    This is the bar in Jacksonville that inspited "Gimme Three Steps" The drummer of this band is named Artimus Pyle.  Clearly, that will be the name of my first born son since it's the greatest name ever.  There are alot of people who don't inderstand my  love  for Skynyrd. The first weekend of my college career, I went to this frat party at the most WASPY rich fraternity in the universe.  I was in the basment gettnig a beer when "Sweet Home Alabama" came on the stereo.  I was so delighted that I sreamed out SKYNYRD FOREVER! and at that very moment the record screached to a hault and I was cast out of the fancy party.  If you want to be cast out of fancy parties and/or get mad respect the next time you're at a honky-tonk bar, I suggest you by the album Gold and Platinum immidiatado.  It's the best mix of Skynyrd ever put together.     Skynyrd goes really well with beer.  I plan on drinking alot of beer tomorrow night.  Here's a list of songs I want them to play: Gimmie Back my Bullets I Know a Little Don't ask Me No Questions Down South Jukin' Simple Man Whiskey Rockin' Roller Poison Whiskey Wino Double Trouble You Got That A-Right T for Texas and clearly Sweet Home and Free Bird.

         It was a good show.  They did a Guided By Voices cover which ruled and it was nice to see a band that was just playing their music and having fun. I'm pretty sure a good time was had by all. I really love  urlLink Summer Stage , it's a really great venue.  Other great things about last night include the change in the weather and my feet not getting wet.  Afterwords, I met up with The One and Only Panda for some champers which, as always, was lovely.

          As a child of the '80s, I was a huge fan when you were on Growing Pains, so I was very happy to see you return in Left Behind--especially in that setting and context. As a believer myself (and a lover of the books), I was wondering how religion has made an impact in your life.    Religion hasn't, God has! Religion makes me ralph...God makes me rejoice!.   Right.  For many other pumpkin positive !exclamations! by Kirk  urlLink check this out .  God wants you to. Special thanks to  urlLink Jessica Lee Jernigan   To check out Kirk's website which, I shit you not, is called  The Way of the Master , complete with "What Would Jesus Do" insignia, go  urlLink here . God wants you to do that too.

         Happy Birthday Pete Townshend. Don't worry, no one beleives that child porn thing. You're super-ultra-mega!  The Who is such a right on band.  When I was little, I made my parents buy "tickets" to watch me dance around the living room to "The Seeker" and other classics (but never "Squeeze Box," that seemed kind of obscene)Thems were the days.

         A few people have been asking me about my boyfriend who's coming in from Utah, like he's real or something.  Duh, ya'll.  It's Ephram.  Clearly.  I mean everyone knows I live just shy of reality so why would this be any different?  Loves  to everyone who beleived me, maybe someday.

      This fabulous band  urlLink Lexiblu  is playing tonight at The Lizard Lounge on West 54th Street at 8pm.     You should go and see them cause they're fabulous and they're family.  I'd be there bopping my head and listening to their amazing lyrics but I'm seeing the Strokes in Central Park, that is if Zeus stops throwing lightning bolts.

         I have such great  love  for Ms. Moore. She's super-ultra-mega. She's not trying to run around like she's older than she is which is a nice change of pace from all those untalented annoyances who seem to think that because they've been on one crappy television show or another they should suddenly be treated as spiritual leaders.  She's so much more, "Whateva, I do what I want." which is fabulous.  I own all of her movies, obvioulsy. Here's another reason why she's fab: "I have no expectations, and people out there really have no expectations because I haven't had great musical success. So that allows me the freedom and creativity to do whatever I want."  How cool is that? So she dumped Epic and  urlLink signed with Sire . e.g. she's gone smindie (semi-indie).  Brava!

         Hurray!  urlLink The NYC made it to the final round  in the race to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. The City is going head to head with London, Madrid, Moscow and Paris.  It's all very exciting....now all we need is 3.6 billion dollars to make it happen. I went to the  urlLink official Olympic website . The site encourages us to celebrate humanity. Cool. Guess who they want us to celebrate humanity with: Nelson Mandela, Andrea Bocelli, Christopher Reeve and  Avril Lavigne  (?). Ok, cause Avril Lavigne celebrates humanity in what way? Well I guess by using all that charcoal eyeliner, she's contributing to the GNP of some third world nation.  Right on Avril!

      The What's up for the weekend was def the party for Stelz at SWAY.  We danced (some of us on top of banquets), the champers flowed. Blackout Dan tried to pick up girls with boyfriends.  I tried to fend off not so cute guys while simutaniously begging very-cute-attached-guy to set me up with some of his very-cute-unattached-guy friends. Pictures were taken. Outkast was played entirely too much.  Stellastarr* and the Killers were not played because according the dude spinning the discs, people wouldn't know it.  Really, cause you just played Jet and that seemed to go over well.  That song was in an ipod commercial.  Oh. Can I buy you a drink? We smoked inside (yay). We danced some more. And some more.  We closed down the place. Blackout Dan and I went to another bar where he told stories he shouldn't have been telling to people he shouldn't have been telling them to. I made out with boys. It was the hottness.    I also took the bus on Sunday TWICE!  I'd only taken the bus once before.  It was great. I  love  the bus. It's my new best friend. We took alot of pictures of our feet and everyone eeeewwwed and cheered as I did my Moose Trick. Then we stood on the corner and spontaniously broke out into song.  Loves  to warm nights and to Amy who thought that  urlLink Prince  was singing Real Men Call Back instead of Little Red Corvette up until like 3 years ago.

      Around these parts, it's very rare that one gets slapped with a new nickname and it sticks--I think we have a winner here.  Introducing Blackout Dan. We'll be following his exploits, as they're often funny.   On friday, we were standing in front of a bar when three Abercrombie hopefulls past by. As they did, he shouted, "this girl needs to take a duke."  They told him he needed a muzzel.  Blackout Dan has no recolection of this.  A few minutes later, this guy walks up to us to ask for a light.  The guy had a thick Mexican accent.  Blackout Dan, imitating this accent said, "This bitch is giving me a hassel, man, a real hassel. Are you listening to me, man." They guy ran away.  Blackout Dan doesn't remember this at all.  Thanks Blackout Dan.  We look forward to hearing from you again.

      It's no secret, celebrities can often be characterized as stupid. They say and do stupid things all the time, just like the rest of us (like last week when I was like the Civil War took place in 1776, that was even funnier because I was a History major)but unlike most of us, their mishaps get plastered all over the tv, papers and internet. You're an idiot here's a million dollars.    These people are just ridiculous. Read what they have to say about the  urlLink countdown to their birthday  and what it was like  urlLink running around the NYC in a towel .  FYI ladies, a 45 year old man counting the days to your 18th birthday isn't nice, or part of being a girl- it's creeped out. Admitedly, there's a small part of me that wants to name a future child Tanqueray, (because I like the word not the gin, I'm a Saphire girl)but this is insane.     urlLink Hey guys, you just named your child Apple .  APPPLE!  What the fuck? The Jarratt thinks I should make up a quiz called "Are You a Slut? hmmmm.  I'll try to work on that.  In the mean time,  urlLink these  are mint and you can learn alot about yourself, for example, if I were an afflection, I'd be ricketts.

         My brother plays the rhythm guitar and I play the clarinet on the intro for Law and Order. Ok not really, but J did do a voice over for a Silly Putty commercial.  Bounce it like a ball. Boom. In other Silly Putty related news, check  urlLink this  out. I had 3 Martinis, 100oz of beer and a gin and tonic last night.  Clearly today things are shaky which is why I insist on posting about nothing (and by nothing I mean even more useless than normal, if that's possible).

         It's amazing, really.  This  urlLink dude has a website  devoted entirely to Murray Head. He's got a chat room going on and everything (fear not, he has also translated the page into English for those of you who aren't francophones).  Don't get me wrong, I think Murray Head kicks ass.  No doubt. But the amount of energy this guy put into this website is mind boggling (note that at this juncture, it doesn't take a whole lot to boggle my mind).

         I have alot of theories. Here's one of them: Until about 1972, New Jersey didn't really exist. Aliens came down  from space with a giant peice of land, put chips in everyone's noses (these chips contain the histostorical information which is now regarded as "truth") and are now trying to populate Earth. I've had a hard time proving this. Another one that I subscribe to is that my friends and I are one step from being famous. We've proven this one many times.  Here's another example: A friend of mine played basketball with Billy Crudup yesterday. Nothing eles needs to said.

            Tonight is the big  urlLink YES  concert at MSG. Jarratt and I are very excited about the whole thing.  YES is such a fantastic band.  Each and every member in musically gifted in a way that is unparalled by most of today's rock and rollers (nobody rocks the double-necked guitar like Christopher Squire).  All of their songs are positive and full of an energy that is both uplifting and meaningful. YES is a prog-rock band so I can say things, like "uplifing" and "meaningful." We last saw them in 2002 at Jones Beach.  There was a point during Heart of the Sunrise where I actually thought I could fly.   Other thoughts on YES include my firm belief that if we sent Classic YES to all the worlds leaders, we'd find peace and understanding. I gotta get on that. Later we're going to pound Martini's and jam out.  Tears will fall, I'm sure of it.

         Here's the part of the show where I talk about my nextdoor neighbors, aka "those crazy freaks." I'm not really sure how many people live there. At least two girls and the weird dude that loves them. They also have a dog.  The dog is extrememly annoying.  The dog yaps, and barks and wimpers ALL THE TIME.  I feel sorry for it.  Mostly because it lives with crazy people. I don't know how these people earn their livelyhoods but it's possible they're track stars.  They're always running back and forth across their appartment-why?  My favorite part about living next to these people is the blood curtling sreams.  Uhuh, yeah.  At LEAST 5 times a day (and i'm never home so you can only imagine) one of them will let out a shreek so loud I debate going over there to make sure everything's ok.  But I never do cause I know it's just because they're crazy.  Sometimes, before the screams, there's a loud crash and we laugh.  I've never actually met these people so it provides me with alot of entertainment--trying to figure out what's going on over there.

         Apparently, not anymore. A 19 year old intern claimed that an NY Assemblyman got her drunk and raped her (though later she recanted saying that her boyfriend was angry that she slept with someone else and told her to claim rape...obvioulsy).  So now they might actually bring forth "legislation" that bans sexual relations between interns and Legislators.  Where's the fun in that?

         Lauren is a year older today.  Her favorite vegetable is bok choy. She likes sauces of all kinds.  Today we had mauguritas, also a favorite but the real one is a French Martini. This is her horoscope for today (and for you if it's your birthday):   Your friends are trying to teach you something that you'd be wise to learn. You may think that you already know it, but practicing with a team helps. If you really apply yourself this year, you can advance to a whole new level. The exam comes when you realize the lessons are costing too much.   Lot's of loves to Stelz.

         This week we've launched head on into Summer, and with that, of course, brings a change in music. I am a firm beleiver in different music for different seasons.  This is not to say that, for example,  The Sunday's "Reading, Writing, Arithmetic" which is Winter music, can't be fully enjoyed during the Autumn months; it just takes on a different role, reminding us of the snow that will soon be falling. The sultry and dewy days of Summer bring with them the passion of Salsa, the breezy relaxation of  urlLink Gilberto , the deisre, evoked by the  urlLink Samples , to hug a tree and of course the freedom and bouyancy that comes with the mother of all Summer bands,  The Grateful Dead . Break out your tapes and head on over to Shakedown Street, it's gonna be a long, long crazy, crazy Summer.

         Yesterday, I had to go to Brooklyn on "business." When I got off the train, the surrounding immediately felt familiar: sort of foggy, warm but with a very sharp nip in the air, many young people milling about or maxin' at cafes even though it was 2:30pm on a Monday--was I in Brooklyn or had I somehow taken the super ultra bullet train out to SF?  It was crazy, it was totally like a Saturday afternoon--or like everyday I lived in San Francisco. There was this one summer when we didn't have jobs and instead tooled around the streets of SF or went out to Marin County and drank marguritas at Guaymas.  So fabulous.  But anyway, I went out to B-lyn to pick up some extra concert tickets for Franz Ferdinand (they have many left at Earwax on Bedford and 5th).  At first I was apprehendive,would they deny me tickets because I live north of 14th street? Did FF suddenly become "5 minutes ago" and nobody told me? Did it sell out already and would I have to run from the laughter of a thousand hipsters (I mean really how could you possibly think there would still be tickets available...).  None of these things happened.  I got my tickets.  I came back to the NYC.  I had moules frites.  Oh wait THIS is best part of my trip over the bridge...I was walking down the street and I heard someone playing Dino.  Then I was crossing the street and I notice this guy hanging out of his car sarenading me.  Blush. Thanks guy, you made my day.

          This guy comes up as the first hit if you type "peculiar" into google.   The other day, I was walking down the street and this gentleman, who was far from homeless,  turned to me and said, "The way you're walking, it sounds like there's a serial killer behind me." What do you say to that? So I just said, "Sorry."    Yesterday, I was walking  down the street  and this guy sidles up to me and says, "How was your day," like he knows me.  So I'm, flipping through the giant Rolodex in my head trying to place him and I must have had a very confused look on my face because then he says, "Yeah, we were just on the Subway togther..." and I realized that I didn't know him at all.  To which I responded, "That's so funny...ha ha."  Why?    I hope everyone has been taking advantage of the Tribeca Film Fest.  Tonight we're going to see  urlLink Satan's Little He lper.   urlLink My new virtual best friend:  I love this guy.  I've read his entire blog. He's like an old friend, an old friend who manages a strip joint. [I am about to use the phrase "wrting style"] His "writing style" has a calming affect on me.  It's almost like he's a character in a movie and not a real person.  Read it and perhaps you'll understand.      Everyone should own the  urlLink Guess Who's  Greatest Hits.  "Hand Me Down World" is probably one of the gretest songs ever, as is "New Mother Nature" and if nothing eles, you can listen to "American Woman" on repeat in an attmpted to banish  urlLink Lenny's  horrid rendition from the corners of your mind.  Canada's never been so cool.

         Brother Jarratt just sent me  urlLink this  -basically because he's always tormented me, saying I have a big nose while molding my smeller into a "vacum clearner"--and this is an extention of that tomenting. I do, however, happen to have a great deal in common with the moose, which is now my new favorite animal.  Apparently, moose can close their nostrils while searching for plants under water.  I too, have the ability to close my nostrils.  It's true.  I'm not kidding.

      This is so awsome.  So I'm reading this blog written by this ultra-conservative Catholic (you can link to it below "ramblings of a crazy freak") and I decided to go to one of her links---now I'm not one to comment on other people's blogs but the spirit moved me and so I did. She was waxing poetic about how as Catholics banning abortions is the most important moral issue of our time, etc. I wrote to her and said that i'm a Catholic and pro-choice,  This is what I got back.  It's priceless:  What a completely uneducated and blasphemous wretch you are . . . not to mention a disgrace to the names you bare.  Woe unto you who call evil good and good evil! You need to repent before God of the vile venom that you have in your heart towards people who simply want to see the Abortion Holocaust end.  Right.   She wrote some more stuff back to me about how we should all slit our throats...I quoted some Axl Rose in response.  I highly recomend seeking out a radical blog and fighting with people over the comment section---so much fun!

      There is lots of  love  happening around me right now, lots.  So first of all, I am in  love  with Modest Mouse's song "Float On." I've been listening to it non-stop; be-bopping all over the place.  When not listening to "Float On," it's been the Killer's "Somebody Told Me" non-stop. So good.  Go buy their albums, imediatado. Also, I'm pleased to announce that the  love  of my life has just been accepted to Juliard.  I am so psyched. As a few of you may know, I was contemplating moving to Utah to be with him, but now, I don't have to.  He's coming here to the NYC on Monday--and will become the concert pianist he was meant to be.  I couldn't be happier.  I'm throwing him a party next friday so mark your calanders.

         So Coachella was super-ultra-mega, obviously. Some things happened:     Before we decended upon Indio, I made a stop in LA and met up with lifetime friend, Larry.  Because Larry is THE COOLEST PERSON EVER, he took me directly to  urlLink In-N-Out Burger .  Clearly the greatest place on earth. (oh and Larry, here's the  urlLink secret menu -use it wisely).  Ok so since Larry is a producer extrodinare I got to accompany him on a shoot, thereby getting to experience all the wonders of LA (including the traffic, it was awsome) in 6 and 1/2 hours. I even got to drive the car down Hollywood Blvd, while Larry shot footage out the back.  AND one of his friends called me "babe."  But sadly, I had to bid Larry, Snake, Fizz and Panther adieu and continue into the desert and the  the literal hottness . The shows ruled. It was  urlLink mad hot . We  urlLink put liquor in sun-tan lotion bottles . I did  urlLink tricks .  The Stills were as amazing as the  urlLink back drop . I died when they played "Still in Love Song" (I  urlLink died  a bunch on this trip, I also did some crying).  Death also occured during none other than  urlLink Death Cab. . Stellastarr*  kicked so much ass it was retarded.  That set was all about realizing that being in an a positively igneous tent smelling of rotting milk just means you have to dance harder and faster, which of course I did, followed by crying.  urlLink Pixies . I can't even talk about the  urlLink Pixies  without having a grand mal seizure.  They were beyond fabulous. I died like 10 times.  They played U-Mass, Veloria, Heaven, Here Comes Your Man, Bone Machine, Gigantic, Carribou, Monkey Gone to Heaven, Debaser...and a bunch more (I'm going to try to put up some set lists as they become available). Radiohead, obvioulsy was fantastic.  They're an interesting band.  Their music teeters between hopefull and depressing; at least for me. urlLink  . Day Two was retarded. Did you know that if you dance wildly to  urlLink !!!  in 110 degree weather, you actually feel better.  It's true, try it. Amazing. Broken Scocial Scene ruled.  There was even a marriage proposal involved. The Killers, well, killed.  There were so many bands I can't go into them all by any means so i'm gonig to skip to the coupe de gras which was clearly  urlLink AIR .  The sun was setting over the Rockies, and AIR was out of controll.  So amazing I spazzed during "Kelly Watch the Stars" and there was some definite death happening during the most ammazing rendition of Femme D'Argent--- EVER !  urlLink The Flaming Lips  put on a ridiculous show. I huge highlight for me came next. Basment Jaxx.  Say what you want about them selling out I don't give a shit. They played  Red Alert .  I danced about like  urlLink whirling dervish .  Then Dizzee Rascal came on to play with them. Death occured. The Cure.  What a sophisticated band. As I was standing amongst the masses of entranced hipsters and goths, the warm desert wind grazing my shoulders, I realized that this band has the power to evoke feelings. Whether it's happiness, bitterness, lonelyness or longing each song saturates you with sentiment until you feel like you're going to succumb. Then we went home.

         Even   I   can't come up with   PEARLS   like that.  No, they come from the throaty Southerner I like to call Tom Petty. I'm going to add Tom Petty to the list of things I'm bringing back for  THE BIG BRING BACK  not so much because he hasn't been along the whole time, but I feel that others have left him behind.  Tom Petty rules, and he's dead sexy, but I mean that just goes without saying.

Yes, he just graduated from high school and is most definitly realted to one of the partners, and yea, he does provide me with entertainment. Most recently, his flirting with another high school graduate who is also related to a partner, has left me in stiches.  Just now, they're talking about if the trains they take to work have bathrooms.

      Ok.  I love terrorism as much as anyone eles, but when the bus bombs start interfering with my homie's vacation agendas, well that's just  busted .  The One and Only Panda was supposed to leave tomorrow for Istambul to meet Spence (aka my best friend eva) and now, she can't go because people are blowing eachother up.  Enough already. Some people want to hang out and get a tan for Christ sake.  Bitches.  Fucking amatures.

          Eminem 'ull make ya'...  This is how  busted  Eminem is: In London, Eminem gave a $450,000 necklace to a fan in the front row of a concert. He had announced while from the stage that "I'm going to give this to the sexiest woman I see." (ok so this was two years ago today but I still think it's a great testiment to what a total wanker he is). I mean he just blew $450,000 on some girl when there are starving people in Detroit! P.S. Slim Dumb-Ass you suck.

          Tomorrow , the uncomparable Felix is blowing in from SF.  This means drinking and singing at  urlLink Junno's .  It will be madness as Junno has promised me not one, but TWO bottles of the wolrd's best burbon whiskey: Pappy Van Winkle.  They'll both be gone by the end of the night.  I highly reccomend joining.  Yesterday, The Yorge and I saw the winner from American Idol at  THE MEGA STORE  (really it was more like Yorge pointing out to me that there was someone who might be the "winner" and me being like, "what? huh? what are you talking about?" and looking around, confused). yeah, it was exciting.

         Last night was mass amounts of fun. Cousin Elaine called me out of the blue and invited me to an exhibit.  It was fabulous.  A provocative instalation/performance piece that incorperated both phtogaraphy, spoken word and neon (obviously).  At this exhibition between Park and Mad. there also happened to be the most ridiculously hot guy eva.  I couldn't help but stare, and then to wonder "is he gay?" because everone else there was.  Unfortunately, I wasn't given the chance to work my magic on this mec as we were shuffled out so the artists to disrobe and put on street clothes,  super ultra never emerged.  Hmmmmm.  Anyway, he didn't really look like the guy in the photo above but sort of; and whatevs, he's hot too. Later, I rationalized that he probably wasn't for me anyway as he may have been too artsy.  I've done artsy.  They're even more on the outskirts of reality than I am so it just doesn't work. Did I emntion that the exhibit was really interesting? Then I had to meet some old chums from school. Elaine came with.  Too much alcohol was comsumed.  There was drama. There was a dancing Rhodes Scholar who looked like a silly owl (description via Elaine). There were attempted smooches.  Thre was an incident I can't recall in Duane Reade involving a janitor.  Basically, it was Thursday.    Tonight I'm going to a fabulous restaurant opening with The One and Only Panda.  They're sending a stretch Hummer for us (and by that I mean we're taking the subway).  At the moment, I'm burning with anticpation.  Dinners with Pands (or anything with pands really) are always top notch--never a dull moment.  It will most def be fab.    Then it's off. To the Franz Ferdinand show in B-lyn.  Which has been  moved BACK TO VOLUME .  The Yorge will be there and fabulous Rob will be in from DC. There will be dancing. And I'm sure there will be drama but hopefully only the good kind.   P.S. Franz Ferdinand the band comes up on Google BEFORE the real Franz Ferdinand.  This world is nuts.

      This morning I was reading the "news" on MSN.  One of the top features was entitled  urlLink "5 Questions Every Man Dreads."   Here's what I learned.  Don't ask questions.  Not ever.   For more advice.  Go to these people.  urlLink The Rules .  I've read this book. It's super-ultra-mega.    The only rule one should really follow is this. Wear a horses head at Thanksgiving and eat out of a feedbag (this is something the J-Razzle and I came up with to describe how Quakers celebrate Thanksgiving---but it's sort of morphed into meaning  drunk )and if he/she calls back, he's/she's a keeper.

But they're hot.  And they're from across the pond. So i guess I'll put my high heels on--and the something I'll do about it is DANCE.

         Did anyone else know that Alanis was 30?  I thought she was alot older than that. Well, the girl with one hand in her pocket ( and I presume it was the left hand since I've been told that if you're over 28 and haven't marched down the aisle of false expectations you're doomed since guys will know "something's wrong with you")can take it out and show the world her ring cause  urlLink she's marrying Van Wilder.  Brava Alanis! You've given stringy haired girls with bad teeth over 28 hope for a life of marital bliss. AND you met him over the Internet.  AAAAAWWWWWW.

      Today I saw this girl almost get hit by an ambulance. Tomorrow there will be fun stuff complete with pictures. But not of the girl almost getting hit by the ambulance.  I mean fun stuff like stupid crap in the media and hot guys I spot on the subway (which, by the way, there have been an over abundance of lately---can you say summer internships....).  And clearly there can be no pictures of the girl almost getting hit by the ambulance cause I don't have a camera phone, or a digital camera or the ability to predict girls almost getting hit by ambulances, so no, there will be none of that.

Clearly, I know the answer since I'm the Sphynx...but I challenge you to take a stab at it.  Hipsters are sallow, their limbs thin like Tiggy's. So how can they gorge on cheese-steaks like piggies?

       urlLink Maybe it's because you live in a place called Peculiar.  Duh.    urlLink We're getting married next week.  We're registered at Astor Place Liquors.   Today's "Oh My God, Shut the Fuck Up Award" goes to:      "It takes too much energy to be a bad girl. There's definitely a part of me that would love to be not completely sensible, responsible, ethical, moral and driven. Just for one day I'd like to go out and do stupid, crazy things and not care whether it were safe or not. But I couldn't. It's just not me."  --Actress JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT in the New York Daily News.    This morning I was talking to Stelz about the death of President Nixon, as we often do.  She asked me when he died and I speculated that it was a few years ago.  It has just come to my attention that he died in 1994.  Which brings me to this:  What in God's name have I been doing for the last ten years?    I'm convinced tonight's the night I'm going to meet a famous rock star and begin a tored love affair.  At least that's what I'm thinking.

         I'm seeing  urlLink !!!  play on a boat tomorrow. This means funny things will happen since drinking and boating will be involved.  Already The Yorge and I have come up with some funnies just in case I happen to get drunk (cause, you know, it's hard to bolt from the middle of the East River) like-- "Can somebody call the Coast Guard?  I gotta get outta here..." "Is there a dingy I can borrow?" "I'm a really good swimmer, I know I can make it..."  In other news, Aran had a fabulous party on Saturday.  And by fabulous, I mean many kinds of baked goods AND mango juice. Also by fabulous I mean by the end of the night, I was saying things like "Holy shit! They're playing Tom Petty!  I was just listening to Tom Petty earlier...I mean for real I haven't listed to him in years...I swear...how fucked up is that...I can't believe it...what are the odds...oh my God they're playing Tom Petty...."  Right. I attribute this not only the the champers had before dinner and the mass quantity of drinks consumed chez Aran but to the various "people" (and by "people" I mean lads I've smootched lately) I randomly saw along my jouneys that evening.  One of whom was, unbenounced to me, witness to this conversation outside a bodega:  ME: Oh my God Jules, do you remember this place?  We were so drunk here...remember? THE JULES: Oh yeah...wasn't that the night we came to get ice and you smashed it all over the ground and yelled at people? ME: Noooooo?  Me????  (Turning and seeing guy)  Me: Heeeeeyyyyy.  (High-Five hand clasp!!!!!! what????? Hive Five hand clasp???).

         Yesterday, I spent the whole day walking around with my shoes on the wrong feet.  I did something eles that was really stupid too but I can't remember.  So today, this blog will be dedicated to stupid things...not unlike myself.   Stupid Signs:   There is a road sign near Cape Cod, Massachusetts that declares: "CAUTION - WATER ON ROAD DURING RAIN    "WHAM for kids, a child abuse foundation."    Stupid vs. The Computer   Co-Worker #1: "A boolean variable has two possible values: true or false."  Co-Worker #2: "Umm...true?"     Customer: "I want to get the new Netscape from you people."  Tech Support: "I'll need to charge your account $30."  Customer: "What do you mean? I pay for this service."  Tech Support: "We're providing the registered version of Netscape. Netscape charges us, so we have to charge you."  Customer: "Well, my son is a socialist and I spent a year in Spain. What do you have to say to that?"  Uh....  Customer: "I thought so." [click]     Stupid Laws:  This one comes from Anniston, AL.  I should have been arrested...  You may not wear blue jeans down Noble Street.      It is illegal to take more than three sips of beer at a time while standing.   --Texas  Clearly, this law is not enforced  Persons classified as "ugly" may not walk down any street .--San Francisco   Even My Car is Stupid  (bumper stickers)   It's been lovely, but I have to scream now.   (actually, I kind of like this one)    Shut up brain or I'll poke you with a Q-tip!!     Please don't tell my Mama that I work on an oil rig... She thinks I'm a piano player in a whorehouse.

      I went to see David Bowie on Friday.  David Bowie is a Rock God.  I can barely begin to explain the energy that surrounded this show.  But I'm going to give it a  whirl (and in doing so, I'm going to sound remarkably like a whacked out crystal clenching non showering date eating doesn't believe in Western medicine passivist, but you know, whatevs). Here's the set-list as best as I can remember (there may be flaws as I was preoccupied with my aura and the girl in the pink bunny costume)  Rebel Rebel  New Killer Star  Reality  Cactus  All The Young Dudes  China Girl  I've Been Waiting For You  Slip Away  Days  Modern Love  The Loneliest Guy  The Man Who Sold The World  Hallo Spaceboy  Sunday  Under Pressure  Life On Mars?  Ashes To Ashes  White Light, White Heat  I'm Afraid Of Americans  "Heroes"   Encore:   Hang On To Yourself  Five Years  Suffragette City  Ziggy Stardust  His performance was flawless.  He was beautiful. Seeing a truly amazing artist like Bowie gives me hope that there is still some humanity on this earth; that there is still some culture, art and creativity that stems less from from imitation and more from a truly living soul. While he was playing, the mood at Jones Beach was one of awe, inspiration, adoration and community.  And I thought if we could all do away with the bitterness, greed, self doubt, anger, selfishness and blame that seems to plague our lives and this world, just for a moment, we'd see how unimportant and insignificant we are as individuals and how great we could become if we just listened to eachother and took responsibility for ourselves, our neighbors our firends and our loved ones.

        . No, I'm serious, I really did.   So I've been slacking in a major way on this blog thing.  I could say it's because I was in St. Tropez Christening my new yaght (ask sombody about it. what.) But that wouldn't be entirely true.  The reality of it all is that I've been glued to the nytimes and craigslist trying to find The Luxury Sky Pad East. It's a serious bitch but it'll be worth it.  Ok, so last night I got drunk and sang "I Will Survive" very poorly.  But that's pretty much par for the course.  Some of you have brought it to my attention that I haven't been making out with strangers as much as I used to.  You're  so wrong about that. I have been.  Oh yes, I have. And I have the random business cards to prove it.    I had a wonderful time last night with Schmoops.  We went to Sweet and Vicious and I learned alot of very useful information--but that's always the case.  Like for example did you know that Guiness is actually a pretty light beer?  Here, I always thought that it was like a roast turkey dinner.  But check it out the next time you order a black and tan---the Guiness floats to the top.  Groovy.  PEARLS  Don't get caught fucking a hen, you could wind up hanging from a tree. Don't move to Russia if you're a lady--you'll have to give up short skirts and Tammy Fay make-up so the mens don't start howling at the moon.  I'm seeing  urlLink Bowie  tonight at Jones Beach.  It should be most excellent. And clearly my face will be a mess.  Buy the  urlLink WONDERSTUFF .  You'll love it most def.    The Jansens is from Appleton.   urlLink His town ruined the mystery behind Houdini  and in doing so, has rocked the worl of prestidigitation.  We're going to stone him when he comes back from the Cote D'Azure.  Just kidding love.  BRING BACK SMARTIES!!!

         The Jizzie turned to me on Sunday evening as we stood on Bare Rocks on the  urlLink Appalachion Trail  and asked this question. I ahven't a clue.  Do you? (p.s. this bird is called the Least Bittern, which I think is cool)    Ok.  So thursday I got drunk with some sailors and sang "Tempted." Jansens was thenonly one who clapped. Thanks doll. Blackout Dan was there(obviously) and tried to instigate a fight with the sailors by threatening to punch me and then fart in my face. But instead of fighting, we did some tequela shots instead. Then I went home and drunk packed.  It's become a favorite past-time of mine, though I don't recomend trying it--it's a disapointing game. Then it was off to  urlLink A-town.  here we relaxed, did some hiking and went to an arts festival.  Oh yeah, and then we got insanely wasted.  Duh. Blair, the coolest guy ever, came to celebrate Memorial day at the homestead. Blair is from England.  Blair is sophisticated and drinks tea so my mom was very excited to show off her tea collection.  More later.  I have to go look a t appartments---bummer.

      Clearly, I'm in SF.  And Drunk.  And at a party. So it seems like the perfect time to update.  But no, perhaps later.  This is boring me and I'd rather go flirt with married people. Bovs  The following is a contrabution by "a friend".  So,   I'm the friend... don't really feel like blogging but you know I'm just saying what I hear from the people that are actually throwing the party.  CCB is having a great time and she may actually meet her match her in SF.  But we'll have to wait and see.   Lots of great, minds in this space...but you know what happens when too many great minds get together...not a whole lot...especially when there's illicit consumption going on.  Anyway, life is rather amusing on the left coast and we could actually have a life here but only if the drug delivery service was better.  Time to sign off...must go and ruin other peoples' lives.

         .   So I'm leaving tomorrow for SF for the weekend. All the Right Coasters are heading back out to the Left Coast for the anual Summer Party. This year brings the addition of Nav's best ev Ingo. We're going boating and fishing and will be doing some general yahooing. It's going to be stupid (and of course that means ridiculously fabulous. I'm going to try and post during the weekend do I don't forget any fun stuff in my drunken haze. Oh yeah, there's going to be a haze. You know I'm going to get drunk and call the boy I met a Place Pigale last time I was out there. That'll be fun. I'm very much looking forward the ridiculousness that's sure to ensue. Last year the party got so big that we broke Ziggy's balcony. Luckily, his lease was up. So this year, we're taking the party to Lake Berryessa---though having a large body of water around might not be the best idea either. Oh well, we'll see how it goes. Sadnesses though is the demise of the LSP. That's going to be difficult to handle after all these years. Squish.   In other news. I start my imporv class with the Upright Citizen's Brigade which should be interesting considering I'm really sick and about 8 people have come up to me today asking me what's wrong as if I'm crying but really I just have a masive head cold. I should have known this would happen, I get sick everytime I go away.

Last weekend,  J  went to AC for Cousin David's wedding.&nbsp; It was pretty much the greatest ever.&nbsp; I went a day early to hang out in NJ with Elaine.&nbsp; I took the train there.&nbsp; I still find trains really novel since I rarely take them.&nbsp; Trains are really convenient in Erope and other parts of the world but here, I feel like I'm riding an over priced cow.&nbsp; For example, my first train ride in the states (aside from various "antique" tains rides in places like  Jim Thorpe ) was from Philly to Boston.&nbsp; It took me almost 11 hours (8 of which I had to sit on the floor) and cost $120.&nbsp;  Busted.  Trains to Jersey, however, are very efficiant and for me, apparently they're also&nbsp; free .     We picked  Cousin Matthew, Kiki, Beth and Jason  up from Newark. ...fuck it, I'm jsut skipping to the part where we got drunk.&nbsp; It's alot more intersting... Fast-forwarding to Thursday...    The church was in Brigantine which is right next to AC.&nbsp; Since the road signs in Jersey blow, we almost missed the exit but since Elaine is a race car driver (revealed) she pulled an  Andretti,  taking us over a median going 75 in a mini van.&nbsp; Better tha n Space Mountain.We showed up at the rehersal about an hour late.&nbsp; The priest yelled at us.&nbsp; There were a bunch of people missing from the wedding party.&nbsp; The preiest yelled at us.&nbsp; I sat in the wrong pew.&nbsp; The priest yelled at me.&nbsp; Then it was over. The priest rememinded us not to come to the wedding drunk.     We had a celebration at  Bobbi Jean's  Grandmother's house.&nbsp; I drank a shitload of boxed white wine and had a  Sweet Lou.&nbsp;  After all the Bud was gone we decided&nbsp;to go gambling, but not before having a few cocktails at the bar at out hotel-- The Tun. &nbsp; They were having a Hawaiian Tropic Bikini Contest there so it was packed.&nbsp; A few gimlets later I convince  J  that a once and a lifetime opportunity has befallen us.&nbsp; Here were are in AC with our relatives, our partents, friends and a whole mess of strangers  AND  kareoke.&nbsp; So we sang  Sweet Home Alabama  in front of everyone, finishing off with  the bump. &nbsp; There was thunderous applause, obviously.&nbsp; And we added AC to the long list of places we've done the bump in.&nbsp;     We lost  Iggy  and decided taht he must have gone to one of the casinos so we set out on foot.&nbsp; I don't remember a whole lot of this but I believe there was a sprinkler involved. When we got to someplace called the Wild Wild West something or other, we decdied to go in.&nbsp; It was very dpressing.&nbsp; I tried to hoc my Jimmy Choo's for no reson what so ever.  J  told everyone in the bathroom that he rather kill a lot of people then cut down a tree.&nbsp; I inquired whether or not the casino had been modeled after the &nbsp; Red Garter Saloon  (fka Burger Barn ) at Dorney Park. I lost $20 in Roulette (after looking for Red 6 for a really long time before I was informed there is no Red 6).&nbsp; I had a margurita to celebrate my loss.     This dude in a big leather hat came up to me and asked for a$1.25.&nbsp; When I turned him down, he began to freak out saying that he didn't need my money, he had his own money, he was simply asking on behalf of one of my friends.&nbsp; Obvioulsy this man was just a fountain of lies but&nbsp;I became worried that a fight might break out so I complimented him on his  chapeau  and explained that, "usaually, when someone asks for my money, that means he/she wants my money."&nbsp; Dude followed us around for a while and tried to come back to our hotel with us.&nbsp; We gave him the slip.&nbsp; Our next destination was clearly  McDonalds  I haven't eaten there in years so you can imagine my surprise when I found out the the #2 (two cheesebuger meal) was no longer available.&nbsp;I was outraged, confused, saddend and ofcourse, angry.&nbsp; I let everybody know it.&nbsp; I think it was a good decision.&nbsp;    We went back to our hotel and ate.&nbsp; I knocked a bunch of food on the floor.&nbsp; This amused us so then we started throwing food on the floor.&nbsp; Then we past out.&nbsp; When we woke up, it smelled.  The next day, we planned to to go the beach.&nbsp; We made it as far as the lobby and decided it would be better to watch movies and order room service instead.&nbsp;  Suddenly, we had to be at the wedding.&nbsp; It was gorgeous.&nbsp; Bobbi Jean looked beautiful.  At the reception, I drank alot of wine and smoked 800 packs of cigarettes.&nbsp; NJ rules because you can smoke  EVERYWHERE &nbsp;and every establishment has a cigarette machine.&nbsp; Fabulous.&nbsp;  J  and I cut a serious rug and were complimented out our very professional dancing abilites.&nbsp; We didn't steal any boats as predicted which was a good thing since I didn't really want to get arrested at my cousin's wedding.   BTW it took me so long to figure out how to work the effing picture upload on this goddamn thing that the caffine wore off and this whole post lacks humor and wit.&nbsp; sigh.  Oh, and one of the groomsmen called me a skanky whore, but you know, whatever.

         Oui, un autre Jour de Bastille est sur nous. Je celbratinai avec une baguette et quelque vin. Espérons que vous ferez pareil. Je vais essayer de parler le français toute la journée, mais jusqu'ici, il ne va pas bien puisque personne je sais parle cette belle langue. Un de mes mémoires les plus amatrices de Jour de Bastille était en 1996. Pendant qu'à Paris, j'avais l'occasion de boire et danser avec beaucoup de marins dans un vieux fort. C'était meilleur. Donc obtenir hors vos bérets et vos attitudes et donne un pain grillé aux grenouilles, ils nous ont donné Gerard Depardu après tout.

         Last night was The Samples show.  It was on a boat. Boats are the coolest thing ever.  They played Did You Ever Look So Nice and Little Silver Ring. The Samples are such a great band. Their sound quality is always exactly the same (perfect).  I'm thinking of wuitting my job and going on tour with them. There's all kinds of happiness and love coming from them.  The crwod was the same; all kinds of happy-go-lucky people who weren't all bitter and angry (or at least checked it at the dock) it was refreshing to cruise around the harbor and not have people scream anti-American sentiments while we past the Statue of Liberty.  Before the show, I met Tim for a drink.  I've been having a really hard time normal as of late, so I'm quite certain I freaked him out. Then we met Jamie, walked to the pier and talked about the Penthouse Club.  Then I had four Vodkas.  We took pictures of eachother on the boat and thanked one another over and over for being cool enough to apreciate all the great things the nyc has to offer in the way of boats. Then I cried cause I didn't win the lottery. I feel like there was dancing involved.  We met the lead singer and I said something really silly like "Hey, I saw you in Nashville last summer.  It was great." I was hoping that by throwing in the Nashville part he would see that I was a devoted fan and be like "Wow I can't believe you were there...that's awsome..."  But not so. Whatevs.  After, we went for beers and I'm quite sure I was talking nonsense the whole time.  I did however put on the best three songs ever put together for a juke-box selection.  One of them was Mother Popcorn.  I can't remember the other two but the bartender and the general public were really impressed.  Tonight's The Stills play a free show in Battery Park.  Clearly, I'll be there.

         These are fireworks from Iceland.    So the 4th turned out ok.  Helena came with Gabe.  It was a treat. I love them.  They're pretty much the best.  Though I'm pretty sure they think I'm crazy.  Helena and I cooed and giggled over the fact that we have the same haircut---and more so because I finally got a "grown-up" haircut.  I'm finally a woman.  Lani and Gabe were going to try to set me up with a boy. But I'm not really sure about that now.  After my incredibly fabulous rendition of Joe Walsh's I Like Big Tits (complete with an encore performance) they may have changed their minds. Not to mention the fact that I supposedly dissed him at New Years, but I have no recollection of that so I'm discounting it. The three of us did some drunk swimming, stayed up till four and I whined cause people kept turning off my favorite Duran Duran song. Stellar.  Cousin Elaine was there too.  We spent alot of time making pina coladas and cursing in the kitchen. We wre both wearing festive Uncle Sam top hats.  It must of have funny for the other guests to see us in our festive Uncle Sam hats saying things like "Well, that's just a crock of shit" especially since I was in full on Southern drawl mode.   The guest of honor, however, was the Undertaker.  You may remember him from such nightmares as "My Parent's Friends Try to Set Me Up With Their Son and He Tells Me That if I Die He Wants to Embalm Me so He Can See Me Naked."  Yeah. So obvioulsy I never went out with this kid.  When he showed up in A-town (his mom assured mine that he would be in the nyc) it was beyound funny.  I could barley look at him. I think the feeling was mutual (except of course when my dress flew up in the wind and you could see my underwear).  Didn't I leave the city for the weekend to get away from the crazy freaks.  Oh well.   Tonight I'm going on yet another boat ride around the harbor.  This time the Samples are going to play.  I have to go hug a tree and put on some birkenstocks now.  Peace.

         Today at lunch, The Yorge had the best  BRING BACK  of the day.  I was telling the story of a particularly awful date when Jorge pulled out, "you should have declared a  PERSONAL FIRE DRILL ". It was the greatest. You may remember  personal fire drill  from the slangtionary days, it's like when you have to get out of somewhere fast, just call a  personal fire drill .  You'll be glad you did.

         Last night, I had absolutely zero intention of going out.  But as they say no rest for the weary.  So I took a fifty block walk, saw a cockroach coming out of a Starbucks (in the 40's on Lex fyi), watched in horror as a man fell in the middle of the street; a car missing him by mere inches, and laughed as I ran into the same transvestite for the eight hundreth time.  Then I met up with Jamie, "numbers guy" extrodinare.  Jamie is fabulous and my cousin.  We had some beers with his number running friends all of whom are lovely.  As we chatted about their recent arrival to the big city, I couldn't help but notice that one of the gentlemen was doing a spot on impression of Andrew Dice Clay/Vince Vaughn.  It was pure insanity.  We stoppped at Luna Park (go now, this is it's last summer before it becomes a playground for all the kids who don't live in Union Square) and I swear this guy actually said "Look at all the beautiful babies." This was no impression.  No, this was reality.  It was magnificiant. It was game like I haven't seen in a long time. Big ups.  Most def.

          Mrs. Marks (fka LA Wolf) is blessed. Somebody  GAVE  her a boat. I just spoke with her and she said and I quoth, "It's like I'm on vacation all the time." I'm really psyched for her and all of her happiness but I've totally figured out her scam. She and her husband run a Christian camp and therefore are ONE with the G-O-D. So I'm thinking, maybe if I start gonig to church and really asking myself, What Would Jesus Do? instead of looking for answers in the bottom of the gin bottle (which I'm still convinced works), I'd get a boat too. We'll see how this plan goes. Oh, it's gone.

          This is the best day EVA. No, really. I'm putting in my vote...this is the nicest day this whole year. I walked outside today and I was like wow. Then, I was like why am I going to work? The answer to that is I had this really "important" project to do for a guy named Tad. So last night's "glass of wine" with Panda turned into an all out drunk fest. Complete with me talking nonsense to strangers and doing a bunch of shots. I had to take a cab to work because I was so effing late it was ridiculous. I drunk packed for my cocktail party across the River tonight. We'll see just how bad it is later. Basically, I'm still drunk. I smell like a liquor cabinet and I've already had to have several meetings with "important" people where I've had to smile and be really wnthusiastic about such things as chroning files. But I think being drunk kind of helped because otherwise I probably would have cried considering the the state of my affiars. So I'm calming my nerves by listening to the DEAD. Always good. I tried to call a  SKIP DAY  at work. Everyone laughed like "oh Claire, you're such a funny trickster" (as opposed to a no good trickster). But I was serious.   Oh and clearly I was making out with boys.

        I  Last night, I was watching a very provocative television program on PBS on "at home" burials (which, incidentally, does not necessarily mean being buried in the back yard, it simply means at home preparation of the body for burial). I've totally decided that this is the way for me. When I die, especially if it's in the near future, I don't want to be taken away in a body bag by strangers and then poked and prodded and filled with pickle juice. The program gave very graphic accounts of just how gruesome embalming is. For the most part, this practice is completely unnecessary as the body does not show any advanced signs of decomposition during the first few days after death; during a traditional morning period. America has completely sterilized both the birth and death processes over the past hundred years turning what was once important familial rituals and practices into a non-participatory and morbid industry. I'd rather my friends and family gather around me in my own home where memories, tears and laughter have been shared as opposed to a cold funeral home parlor set up to look like someone's living room. Further more, studies show that participation in the death process can ease the grieving period and provides a better sense of closure. Unfortunately, "at home" burials are illegal in five states including New York, but work is being done to change that. I'm going to start looking for hand made caskets. You're all invited. There will be liquor, clearly.
