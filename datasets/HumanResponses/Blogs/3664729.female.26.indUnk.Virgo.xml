      I am so blessed to have two really great lady friends.  I am going out with one of them on Friday. I can't wait. It's going to be so much fun!  I met Elizabeth a few weeks after we first moved here.  She and I immediately hit it off.  It seemed that we clicked so well, like we had known each other forever.  I met Karyn a few days after she moved here, and it also seemed like we just clicked immediately.  How often do you find an instant friend?  They help keep me sane. Although they are both at least 5 years older than me, I never feel like a third wheel.

      just what a great man I married.  He rewards me everyday.  Right now, he is sitting on the couch holding Rivvyn, while reading a story to Jadzia & Xienna.  He is a great "girl" daddy.   I love how detailed oriented he is. He is an excellent cook.  Tonight he made a chicken dish with McCormicks Zesty Herb. Delicious! He is just so amazing. Now if I can just get him to clean up after himself, he'd be perfect. =)

      I don't know we are going to make it.  We are just so stressed financially.  Even with Paul's good job, we are just barely making it.  I need a job by next week.  If I don't get a job soon, I don't know what we'll do.  This is just so stressful.   I am praying that Paul's interview, Wednesday, goes well. It will really help us out financially. I am worried that we may have to declare bankruptcy just on the credit cards. I am so scared. I feel so irresponsible.

      I am so very blessed.  Today I was given a crib, two crib mattresses, crib sheets, and some Little People toys, all for free.  I said a prayer of thanks on the way home, because I was so overwhelmed with thanksgiving.

       Big Trouble in Little China  is only one of my favorite movies of all time. It's one of those movies you can watch over and over, and never really get tired of it.  It's great to watch during bad weather, when you can't go outside anyways.  It's fun to find it on TV, since I have yet to find it on DVD.  Paul's hobby is his DVD's.  After we finally sold all of our VHS movies, he started to collect only his favorite movies on DVD. We just recently got  Cheaper by the Dozen  on DVD, now that could be an all time classic too.   We took the girls to visit thier Lola Cafe today.  And I got to thinking, What am I going to be, when I become a grandmother. Will I be a Grandma or a Lola?  I think I will be a Grandma, and wear a wild purple hat with a big feather, and strut around town, just because I can.  I will make people turn heads just by entering the room, and I shall do as I please. =)  As I watch my husband on the floor playing with our four girls, I can honestly say that I am not looking forward to being a Grandmother, because I am so enjoying being a mother.  Watching my Love play with such abandon with our children, I am so glad to live in a time where digital cameras are affordable enough to capture all the cute fun.

      So being a mommy to four girls is alot of work. Don't believe that being a parent is easy.  If you do it right, it isn't easy. If you let the day care, preschool, TV, and their friends parent them, then it's your own fault.  I don't have perfect kids, but I have perfectly ingenius kids.  If I could just harness that creativity, I mean where do they come up with some of this stuff?  They keep me constantly praying for an extra set of limbs, and eyes in the back of my head.  Jadzia and Xienna, just today, managed to turn the house upside down before 8am.  I have a headache right now just thinking that when Paul comes home, I mean, has he ever seen our home in anything other than disarray? LOL  It's such a challenge to get everyone fed. I mean, yeah, I only have 4, how hard can that be? Well, for me, pretty difficult. 4am Qaizyn eats, 5am Rivvyn eats, 6am I turn cartoons on so I can make breakfast without two sets of hands trying to help me break eggs and coat for floor with slime. 630am everyone's fed, time to attempt to get dressed. Sometimes I wonder why I even bother.  Just as Jadzia gets herself dressed, she's getting herself undressed, trying to get Xienna dressed is an Olympic sport. Qaizyn and Rivvyn sometimes just stay in PJs. Now that I have threatened Jadzia with putting her nose on the wall if she doesn't keep her clothes on, Xienna has managed to get naked again. UGH! Thank GOD the twins can't get naked without help yet. LOL  8am feed Qaizyn, 9am feed Rivvyn. I am already ready for a nap myself, and my head is starting to ache, from what I can only assume is a chronic headache.   Today, Jadzia and Xienna managed to pull the mattresses off thier beds, into the living room, and propped them on the couches. When asked why? Jadzia said, "You told us we couldn't jump on the couches, so we are jumping off the couches." Uh huh! OK. Well, Duh, Mom! LOL

      Today is my first entry. I was thinking about what I wanted to write, and feeling rather quiet, I decided to just jump right in, to my life's quirks.  I finally have all four girls quiet. Notice I did not say asleep, just quiet. I find that being the mother to four little girls under the age of four, there is RARELY any quiet.   Let me introduce you, briefly, to my family.  My husband and I didn't exactly meet conventionally, but then again, who does.  We have a modern, yet classical romance going. We met one October day in 1996 on AOL.  Yep, we are truely an internet couple. =)  Just the first of our life's quirks.  After conversing for exactly one year via the internet and phone, we met in Ohio.  I won't go into the details, since they ARE private to him and I, suffice it to say that we knew we really did want to spend the rest of our lives together.  In February of 1998, much to the fear of my parents, I flew myself to California to start what would become the greatest adventure of my life.  In December, Paul proposed to me. =) So after having had nearly 2 years to get away from me, he didn't want to. *smile*  We married in October 1999, three years to the month of having first met.  February 2000 brought our daughter, Jadzia Reyn.  March 2002 brought our daughter, Xienna Skye.  January 2004 brought our twin daughters, Qaizyn Wynn & Rivvyn Layn.  In April, I got my tubes tied. *smile* One of the best things about becoming a parent? Naming Rights. =)  Jadzia, (Jahd zee ah) my "I'm too young to have kids at 22" baby.  Although she surprised us, she is amazing.  Such a thoughtful girl, I really did good with her. She has such sweet manners, reads already at age 4, and can write too. She is so interesting to listen to. She can tell some really creative stories. I enjoy teaching her "big" words to throw around.  When she was first born, I didn't share her with anyone but Paul.  Noone could hold her, change her, play with her. She was mine!  As more children came, I loosened my grip on her, much to her relief, I'm sure.  Xienna, (Zee in ah) my "Two is perfect" baby. I was sure we were done, with Xienna.  She is such a happy-go-lucky kid. She is a joy, and so frustrating sometimes.  She does this funny little "happy dance" whenever she does something good or new.  Right now she is nearly potty trained, and does a happy dance every time she goes to the potty. LOL  She happy dances when Daddy juggles, when the music is playing, when we put a movie on, just about all the time.  I love the little happy dances.  Qaizyn & Rivvyn, (Cay zen, Rivv en) my "You have got to be kidding" babies.  We went to have my tubes tied, only to find out we were expecting. Just before Halloween, we found out we were expecting twins. Me: "What do you mean, twins! Look again, you can't be serious. Twins? as in 2? Don't faint love (poor Paul), just breathe. Is this some sort of sick Halloween joke? I can't have more, I'm getting my tubes tied." Alas, two were coming, and very soon.  Now I can't imagine them not with us. So we're not the "Family 4-pack" I had begun to envision. Now we are 6.  You know the movie, Cheaper by the Dozen?  We are a half-dozen. LOL  They are only 5 months old, but already have little quirks about them. Qaizyn is my thinker. You can just tell she's absorbing every little detail. While Rivvyn is my chatterbox. I have never seen a little baby so sociable. They were born at 31 weeks, due to a twin/twin transfusion. To find out more, I'll add a link.  So Qaizyn is a pound bigger than Rivvyn.  But they sure are miracle babies. Did you know that they cost our insurance company $1 million dollars each?! LOL You'd think the insurance companies would provide free contraception and tubal ligations, after hearing that. LOL
