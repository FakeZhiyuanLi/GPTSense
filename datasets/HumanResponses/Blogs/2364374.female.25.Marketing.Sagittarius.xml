      Among the most important things in life,i think the friends we go with remain of prime importance as its always rewarding to have accompanying compliant partner with whom to share the journey of life.   I believe great things starts little and i know that God created me female,to be the loving support and helpmate of a man and I pray the Lord prepares the heart of any man who may enter my life with interests of no more than a friendship commitment,no string attached..if a man is to be mine, I need to know that he chose me for himself because we hold admiration for,laugh with and share the same goals/values/beliefs.

      sometimes i find wot i wanted isn't really wot i need and the dream in all its promise was never meant to be.All my hope and desperation wont make it like it was and i believe the pain will never pass.Believe me in time it does... You've gotta know when love is over,you've gotta learn to carry on and with the world upon your shoulders,you walk away when hope is gone.When your golden read has reached the end...i find a way to start again.i know there's a time for letting go.When i'm standing tall tomorrow looking back at yesterday,thru the memory of my sorrow.How the dawn was so far away.I'll be far beyond the shadows.Where hearts can learn to shine and i'll realize the endless nite was only a moment in time.The nite os long,the nite is cold with nothin' to believes in.Just hold on,cuz life goes on.My new day is waiting,let go and let it begin..........

      Have you ever asked a question and not wanted to hear the answer? I do this all the time.I often ask , "What did I do to deserve this?" I can't tell how many time I've whisper that question. or how many times I've seen that question in the haunted eyes of others.But what really tears at my heart is that in most cases..we dont want to hear the answer. Deep inside,i am..we're sure already know..and it's killing... I believe the abuse i've suffered,the neglect,the abondment by family..the pain of life alone in the cold and brutal world...who's fault is this??? And i think that God must not care. That's why I often ask another question that i dont want to hear the answer to: " Are you out there,GOD? I know the answer to this one.I know God loves me. And perhaps loves others the most of all,because we need Him the most.Yes! God is out there - and He's also inside each one of us,waiting to be revealed.

      Something I discern about myself day in and day out after attempting at discourse with people at work, home, Internet, and other - I really need to stop letting people dictate what my mood should be. I have been pondering this for quite some time - perhaps for a few years. Some people seem to be self-sufficient with this; they face hostile people at home, friends having a bad mood swing, and angry co-workers and they act like nothing has happened.  Then there is me. Commonly I endure nothing but rancid attitudes by people around me and it really brings me down. Do not get me wrong, I have yet to meet someone who has the most perfect home life and friends. However, can't I be surrounded by happiness for a change? I often wonder why I cannot have one full day where people are calm and nice. By no means confuse this with me being disgruntled about people talking to me about problems. That in itself makes me happy as I enjoy being useful and helpful to people. It is the occasion in which the individual directs their anger toward me that drives me toward the feeling of general hopelessness.  Also, how come I have to be afraid of setting people off? How come I have to act cautious and apologetic around people just so they won't become upset? How come people do not act that way around me? The cause of my general resentment is not one person or one single event; yet, it is the aggregate of what I have felt throughout many years as a person and was never able to fully understand why.  Nevertheless, for those of you who know me well enough, ostensibly this may be one of the causes of my general desire to vanish. I try to keep track of my own personality and often times wonder, am I generally a pessimistic person? I have learned in life that how one may dictate the individuals around them is often a reflection of them. Buddhist teachings go about this motif through the use of a fable or parable. Here is one example:    SuShi and the Buddhist Monk    [This story is from Nomis Fung]  The famous Chinese poet SuShi* (1037-1101 A.D.) was visiting his friend, who was a Buddhist monk. SuShi asks the monk what SuShi is like in the monk's eyes.  The monk replies, "In my eyes, you are a Buddha."   SuShi is very happy with this response.   The monk then asks SuShi the same question, and SuShi answers, "In my eyes, you are dung!"   The monk smiles and SuShi is delighted, because he thinks he is better than the monk.   Then some days later, SuShi tells the story to a friend, and the friend tells him the truth, "The monk sees you as a Buddha, because he sees everything as Buddha, because he has a Buddha's heart and eyes. You see the monk as dung, because you see everything as dung, because you have dung’s heart and eyes  In essence, SuShi saw everything around him as excrement not because he was better than them, but because excrement was what filled his heart and mind. And so I wonder, do I feel that people around me are pessimistic because I myself am one? For those that care to respond, let me know what I am like as a person.

      What a difference 24 hours makes. Why can't I control my moods and why does every little thing bother me? And if anyone could read my mind and understood the reason, they would laugh at how stupid of a reason it is. Nevertheless, this is not fun.  I'm currently filled with hatred and rage. I. Must.

      The Ethereal - Beyond All Dreams I sit here attempting to cultivate an elucidation for my sorrow. It is now 4:32 AM and while I should have been in bed long ago - I cannot sleep. My mind drifts as slowly as clouds toward a listless afternoon sky. The precise feeling within me is that of having your heart torn out impetuously using a dull object. I wish to come to terms with why I feel this bereavement, especially after starting the week in such a positive, upbeat mood.  I am not able to discern why I feel unloved, unwanted, and antipathy between everything I like and me. In simple words, it is the same feeling as having someone you love reveal to you that their love for you amounts to the warmth of an icy tundra in Antarctica.  Nevertheless, I should be feeling better by this weekend. If I do not, then I will attempt to go somewhere where I can be alone with my thoughts. I apologize for these two days of rambunctious postings - it is superfluous even for me.

      Today was MUCH better than the past two days. I am hopeful that this mood perseveres for the weekend. I need to grow a thicker skin and not allow the smallest difficulties make me feel so crestfallen and dejected. Nevertheless, I still have much thinking to do, but I think I will be fine now for a while. I feel quite ashamed though at myself. I hope I was not too disappointing as a person sounding all depressed like!.

       Until Death Overtakes Me - In the Mist  So November is ending and the month is off to a very crappy, terrible start. Normally I would enjoy my free-time, but the more I sit around the more lonesome I become. I actually look forward to work now and I am glad that I'm working and spending most of my day out of the house and away from people. Both of my jobs are easy and once I get used to the whole waking up early thing, I'll be fine. I'm actually already waking up before my alarm clock is set to ring. Of course sometimes I go right back to sleep, but I'm working on that. ;)  The past few nights I have been battling chest pains and an elevated heart-rate. Today my skin is burning for some unknown reason. I can hardly put my right arm down without it brushing against my shirt and causing it to burn badly. I do plan on going to the pool tonight for I have not gone in a while. Because of my recent heart and chest troubles, I will not go to the pool with the intentions of spending two hours swimming out as hard as I can like I normally do. I think I will just do light sets of everything and hope that my pains have all been a fluke

        No one knows what it's like To be the bad man To be the sad man Behind blue eyes And no one knows What it's like to be hated To be faded to telling only lies But my dreams they aren't as empty As my conscious seems to be I have hours, only lonely My love is vengeance That's never free No one knows what its like To feel these feelings Like i do, and i blame you! No one bites back as hard On their anger None of my pain woe Can show through No one knows what its like To be mistreated, to be defeated Behind blue eyes No one know how to say That they're sorry and don't worry I'm not telling lies No one knows what its like To be the bad man, to be the sad man Behind blue eyes.

      I'm so tired of being here Suppressed by all my childish fears And if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave 'Cause your presence still lingers here And it won't leave me alone  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time cannot erase  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years But you still have All of me  You used to captivate me By your resonating life Now I'm bound by the life you left behind Your face it haunts My once pleasant dreams Your voice it chased away All the sanity in me  I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone But though you're still with me I've been alone all along

        KAMIKAZE ROAD ACTION Drivers cutting on emergency lanes,motorcyclists zooming off like Trinity in the crazy chase no The Matrix Reloaded and the car crash aftermaths on federal Hi way.These people are obviously part of Neo's gag out to save the world by outracing cleverly disguised agents.     RENDERED CROWDS Why do so many people in K.L look alike? You'll have noticed this especially when you're walking around in places like Sg Wang Plaza or when you're on LRT.Glad you asked.It's because these people are FAKE! The Matrix has generated that to simulate you being in a large crowd.None of that is real.It saves the Matrix time trying to construct actual bew people to fill K.L.Ingenious machines.    HAUNTED SPOTS IN K.L KL is hotbed of supernatural activity,with its multitude of haunted houses and pontianak(vamp..) sighting.And in the tale Beyond from The Animatrix, a girl almost discovers the truth about reality when she explores a supposed haunted house where physics is skewed.Meanwhile,in The Matrix Revolutions,the Merovingan explains that werewolves and vampires are really renegade programs that have refused to be terminated and have thus mutated.So that's where all your KL supernatural activity comes from-glithes in the Matrix    FOOD THAT TASTES THE SAME How would machines know how food should taste?They don't,so they guess.This was explained by the ill-fated Mouse in the first matrix when he was cintemplating why a lot of meats taste like chicken.Similarly, why do you think food in cafeterias,post-clubbing lok lok and mamak food everywhere are al standard?    CONTINUOUS AND UNNECESSARY ROAD CONSTRUCTION Whenever the roads appear to have been fixed,construction starts all over again.Deja Vu? Exactly what Neo said in the first Matrix that occurs when something has been changed, in order to perfect the illusion of the Matrix.Except that in KL,it's just a perfectly constant illusion.

       LORD OF THE RING - RETURN OF THE KING  5WAYS TO LOSE YOUR RING IN KUALA LUMPUR  1. USE THE POSTAL SERVICE its a lil bit cliched,perhaps, but it still remain one of the most reliable ways to lose things.Just place the ring in a translucent white envelope,mail it and let our postal service take care of it.  2.SEND IT BY AIR Not necessarily needing to do it by mail,Frodo could easily just place the ring in a tightly wrapped suitcare ot box,paste the words "Fragile" and "Handle with care" on it, and check it in before it disappears without a trace.  3.WALK DOWN A DARK ALLEY IN A BAD AREA OF TOWN Go on and walk down the length of the street looking like you have one extra piece of jewellery on you.  4.FLUSH IT DOWN THE BOWL OF A PUBLIC TOILET A common idea,but very practical,especially since no one's willing to pay the plumber bills to unclog the toilet.  5.GIVE IT TO A CIVIL SERVANT IN THE TAX DEPARTMENT And wait while you are sent income tax form so that you may in turn receive other form under which the item will be filed,it would be have been forgotten in some stateof oblivion called "tax return".

Darkness falls..moon set itself high up,decorating the black sky.Clowd gathered and stars appears and simple tiny dots fullfilling the darkness itself ..everything was so calm and quiet... and the smell of rain..rises with the smell of earth.. the sound of emptiness..just ..emptiness...cold.. Black~!the summons of creatures all over..simple gestures out of no where .. sudden euphorias..the feeling of being watched..those urges come and go..scared but yet feel safe..the smell of earth..arouses..surounds..and u couldnt feel yurself in yurself..not outside .. but just..lost.. Life is beautiful but yet..the decoration of it could turn out to be fade...black n white...couldnt really know how to tell yurself.. Emptiness crawls ..and had had been inside the soul.Darkness falls .. and crawls the minutes ..and mysteries is all over it till the sun ..bring back life ... and shines..beautifully up on the empty sky .. A new day comes but yet ... darkness always waits .. and will bring it own mysteries .. ever...~!But suddenly .. it was just..the hope that crawls for it..u are still ..yet..be...searching..within the dark..black..empty space kindda awkward telling without knowing .. and maybe these words aint gonna tell u anything ..maybe it will just be some blatant lies.. maybe some words could be in fact telling u what i am all about .. but .. just aint got no words to fullfill this space..just need u to know and explore it for yurself .. what lies beneath all that is still remains.. The Light within the darkness gloomy soul..light that could shine bright within these darkness...empty space... These empty dark .. soul of mine ... will u be the one ?..

      here i am again..well today i got a bit energy to go online..i wus sooooooo sick for the past few days since i got here..i wus not able to do anything..i just wanna go back to K.L.. So many unexpected things happened in my life lately.Till i got no mood to write..but i promise i will be back with many happening thing..i got so sick with my life..y can't i be like the rest?..i think my whole life is a mistake..i wonder if god exist..but somehow, someone came out of no where and give me strenght to go on..i'm living with his spirit now..and i always remember all the things he said.And he will always be my angel..even i'm so far away n didnt communicate with him like before..and i really feel now that i am losing my best friend.But i just want to let him know that,no matter what,no matter how he hated me,how for i wanna run away from him,i could never ever lie to myself,that he will always be the one.   Until the day I die   until the day i die I'll spill my heart for you  As years go by I race the clock with you But if you died right now You know that I'd die too  You remind me of the times When I knew who I was  But still the second hand will catch us Like it always does  We'll make the same mistakes I'll take the fall for you I hope you need this now Cause I know I still do  Should I bite my tongue? Until blood soaks my shirt We'll never fall apart Tell me why this hurts so much My hands are at your throat And I think I hate you But still i'll say, "remember when" Just like we always do  We made the same mistakes Mistakes like friends do

      I will be walking one day Down a street far away And see a face in a crowd And smile Knowing how you made me laugh Hearing sweet echoes of you from the past I will remember you  Look in my eyes while you're near Tell me what's happening here See that I don't want to say Goodbye My love is frozen in time I'll be your champion, and you will be mine  Later on When this fire is an ember When the night's not so tender Given time Though it's hard to remember I'll still be holding to you I will remember you  So many years come and gone And yet the mem'ry is strong One word I never could learn Goodbye True love is frozen in time  So please remember........

      In the beginning we were such good friends, But why did I let my feelings make it complicated and tense  But then I got caught in the trap that love set for me And I was no longer free Cause you were the only person that I could see!  You said that we were not meant to be And you were not free! You said that everything has got it's place and time And that you would never be mine  Friends is what we decided on But who am I trying to con? Sometimes I am hurting like hell But no one in this whole world can tell!

      When I lay and think, in my bed at night,  the day you'll arrive, seems nowhere in sight.  I toss and I turn, dreaming of you,  opening my eye's... checking if my dream came true.  It didn't, again, and a tear starts to roll,  weeping quietly... my pillow I hold.   Many sleepless nights I've prayed for you if God ever exist He touched my soul from heaven above  He's answered my prayers  I've never felt this lucky, God did this for me.  That's a question I asked each and every night.   He must think your special, and I know he's right.  No other has made me feel so complete,  my whole life was lived, just so we could meet.  All these thoughts and more going through my head.  I fall asleep not worrying, but dreaming of you... instead   but then...it's only in my dream... i live in my dream........

      Fumbling his confidence  And wondering why the world has passed him by  Hoping that he's bid for more than arguments  And failed attempts to fly  We were meant to live for so much more  Have we lost ourselves?  Somewhere we live inside   Dreaming about Providence And whether mice or men have second tries  Maybe we've been livin with our eyes half open  Maybe we're bent and broken  We want more than this world's got to offer  We want more than the wars of our fathers  And everything inside screams for second life

      I pick up the phone  I'm dialing your number  while I pray you're at home,  at home and alone  'cause I can't function on my own  And I'll never stop believing   The repent is done  You are the one  The radio is on but the sound is off gone  And I wanna walk out in the sun  But lately that's been very hard to do   I've got a thing about you  And I don't really know what to do  'cause I've got a thing about you   I pick up the phone  I'm dialling that number and  my heart like a stone  waits for the tone  I can't make it on my own  And I'll never stop believing   I know what is right and this is so wrong  Alone in my bed, better off on my own  The TV is on but the colours are gone  And lately you've been painting my world blue   And I don't really care what you do  And I don't really know what to do  Hoping this story cuts through

      In the midst of my heartache I found myself a recollection That you were here, two figures stand Joined hand in hand And in the midst of my love You understand that I must leave this house In the morning, our lone candle no more While tonight, I kiss the boulders Signaling me beneath your shoulders.  In the morning Love climbs steps to the Sun Where the lightower Makes it easier To find others like us In ruin Looking to find a ripe cherry mind A Soul to confide the spirits of the world In this carousel Called momentary delight.  And all this, entirely,  if you take love to the moon tonight A round trip ticket to the sun Lighted by the desperate gates  of your shipwrecked soul Where this traveler can sleep And sleep - Over your sea of honey lips, Soak in the wineglass of your eyes Making music from the violins in your hair The following night. I promise I'll even have the rain fall And the rain falls Proudly.  As you breathe, As you dream, and I dream With the peace of guitar I know "you can't step in the same river twice" If you'll take my love to the moon on this wounded, blazing night.

      You walked into the room  The sun hit my eyes  The force you struck me down caught me by surprise  You sprung the mojo and it worked like a charm  I felt invincible with you in my arms   I must confess it can feel good to feel pain  Like breaking waves or getting caught in the rain  Playing those games cause we had nothing to do  I was oblivious I was losing to you   The more I gave to you the more you grew bored  And making love became the waging of war  No peace  No tenderness  No fun anymore   I dreamt that I called out your name  You turned your face to me and started to say  Something so beautiful it hurt deep inside  So I will love you till the day that I die   Farewell  I'm sure gonna leave you

         Sometimes life can seem bleak    And we find it hard to cope,    But comfort can be found    If we call for an Angel of Hope.    God sends these special angels    To protect us from all harm,    And gives them healing powers    To keep our spirits calm.    So if your heart is troubled,    Your world no longer bright,    Just call upon an angel    To surround you with her light.

      Loneliness is your only friend. A broken heart that just won't mend Is the price you pay.  It's hard to take when love grows old. The days are long and the nights turn cold When it fades away.  You hope that he will change his mind But the days drift on and on. You'll never know the reason why he's gone.  You see his face in every crowd. You hear his voice, but you're still proud So you turn away.  You tell yourself that you'll be strong. But your heart tells you This time you're wrong.  Where we learn to live without love. he's gone and you're at the end.

      Iâ€™d like to see you in the morning light I like to feel you when it comes to night Now Iâ€™m here and Iâ€™m all alone Still I know how it feels, Iâ€™m alone again  Tried so hard to make you see But I couldnâ€™t find the words Now the tears, they fall like rain Iâ€™m alone again without you  I said stay, but you turned away Tried to say that it was me Now Iâ€™m here and Iâ€™ve lost my way Still I know how it feels, Iâ€™m alone again

      Countries at war,  The sound of shooting from afar, Little children cry out,  Women scream and shout, Rivers of blood that run,  They know it is not much fun, But, the fighting goes on.  Young men tired of the fight  That goes through day and night, Mothers who have lost a son,  Young girls who mourn a loved one, Life had only just begun,  They know the war is not fun, But, the fighting goes on.  In the fields, where he once ran,  Lies the body of a man, They say he died for a cause,  And was given great applause, Yet, the one who sold the gun  Knows that dying is not fun, But, the fighting goes on.  I sit and watch, in shocked silence,  Man's madness and violence, 'Thou shalt not kill', it's been said,  Why they shoot each other dead? Playing out in the sun,  Wouldn't it be much more fun? Don't let the fighting go on,  Don't let the fighting go on.

      I run from you I run from me I run from the person I no longer want to be I run from the past I run and feel free I run on the hard pavement For miles, it carries me  And I run so hard 'Til my cheeks are red with blood I run over pebbles And puddles of mud The cool, crisp night Fills my lungs with sweet air I run to not think To not have a care  I run to escape The ghosts that still haunt I run toward all The things that I want I run past the trees And the people walking dogs I run until all my worries Dissipate in the fog  And I ran away from you And I ran away from me And I ran away from the woman You insist that I must be I ran so far along That I'm back where I began Tomorrow I'll return To run away again

      If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you But make allowance for their doubting too, If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, Or being hated, don't give way to hating, And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise: If you can dream--and not make dreams your master, If you can think--and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build 'em up with worn- out tools: If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breath a word.........

      Dark angels fly up high Dark angels fly down low  Black wings on starless nights with golden eyes that glow  he whispered from lips of crimson rose as all around me his black wings closed Drink of this wine my sweet gentle lover as I hide you in the night  under shadows gentle cover  Let me show you this world in a different light and if you give me your heart  then I will give you the night  and as I lifted my head sweet like rain on my face these words sprang from my mouth as my last saving grace  you haunt me in dreams you haunt me at night full of bansee screams full of venums spite  you haunt me in the moon as you haunt me in the day and my heart is but an instrument upon which your fingers play

      Would you know an angel, If one appeared to you? Do they all have wings, And eyes the deepest blue? Would you know an angel, By the glow around their head? And is it true we sometimes go, Where even they're afraid to tread? Would you know an angel, If it was right in front of you? For I have seen an angel, In my heart I know its true. I have seen an angel, And it didn't have two wings. It didn't have eyes of blue, Or those other things. I have seen an angel, It stood right in front of me. I touched his face and kissed his lips, But knew, it was not meant to be. I have known an angel, And had heaven here on earth. And if I died tomorrow, I would not regret my birth. So search for your angel, But don't be fooled by what you see. An angel may have deep blue eyes, Or look a lot like you.

      Empiricism is a theory which holds that the origin of all knowledge is sense experience. The term also refers to the method of observation and experiment used in the natural sciences. Often, empiricism is contrasted with rationalism, a theory which holds that the mind may apprehend some truths directly, without requiring the medium of the senses.

      The Return of the King Oh my gosh...I have NO words for how compelling this final movie in the saga was. I know not everyone is as sappy and gungho about things as I am, and though I cried, I know hardly anyone else will. ;) I can accept that; BUT, even so, I am fully confident in the ability of this film to really move you so, you MUST GO SEE IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! I think even people who DIDN'T really care for Lord of the Rings will not be able to help getting into this final one. If you've seen ANY of the previous films, you MUST see this one. It was so much tighter, cohesive, and dramatic...the action just pushes forward, and it's amazing, I found myself thinking, that they managed to cram all that drama into 3 hours and 30 minutes. LOL I know. The irony. But I'm totally serious. I hope I can sleep tonight...*shaky sigh/sob* LOL

      These trying times  Make us reach for the sky, While forgetting the forsaken ground These trying times Bring deafness to our ears, While we're all listening for the sound Of  Ominous pools of Witnesses slain, who will Cast off their silences Sworn in your name, but Your inebriated state Evades your crucifixion Well, so long And good riddance  But what of the augurs You've heard in your dreams? Are you hearing them now? Do you know what this means? All the stones that you've thrown  Come back at you in threes And three's all That they'll need  And these trying times Make us reach for the sky, While forgetting the forsaken ground These trying times Bring deafness to our ears, While we're all listening for the sound Because  Under steeples you hear People praying in pews: "I'm sorry for the things That I can't ever lose, I'm sorry that my razors Came before your noose, Forgive me, You should choose  And not I -  What was I thinking? I'll just turn around, Say goodbye, Walk right out of your life, Ignore these thoughts I feel sinking.  I can't help but feel guilty  When you're pointing your finger, I'll apologize now and It won't be 'till later That I'm able to realize  Who is really the saviour And who is The betrayer.  Beacause as these trying times Make us reach for the sky, We're forgetting the forsaken ground And as these trying times Bring deafness to our ears, we're all  Still listening for the sound."

      "Lost, Unspoken Love"  The iris' unwillingness to move Is the thing that has always forsaken Our words, our thoughts, our actions - all That's left to do is retrace them.  Words that could not escape the chords, Trapped in the throats and the dying lungs, And they certes were not strong or able enough To abandon our lips or our atrophied tongues.  Thoughts that were barred by reality, Although that was what they never would touch; For as they soared high on innocent wings, It was the doing of things that remained the true crutch.  Actions that never transmitted through bodies To discover potential, left in deserts to die You and I, in the end, were to cause their undoing, While the absence of doing was our only goodbye.  We knew each other then, As we still do now, Even as our distances will still seperate - Why would we need To tell what we know? It's not the nature in which we communicate.  The iris' unwillingness to move Is the thing that has always forsaken Our words, our thoughts, our actions - all That's left to do is retrace them.  But our eyes Can always Make excuses For our minds To forget Lost, Unspoken Love.  Now that I've poured out my heart to you like an emo kid....

      Today is a day I do NOT look forward to, but am sure I'll live through, as I always do. I have MANY MANY	 massages today, which I'm praying I'll get through without disgusting anybody. I've also had a lot of paperwork mumbo jumbo to get taken care of today...bleck. I still feel confused about everything, and when I say everything, I mean everything. What I want to do after this year, where I want to be, my sense of abnormality, what the hell I'm doing, what I want out of a relationship, what I want out of a career, what I think 'career' means, right down to what pair of underwear do I want to wear tomorrow. All confusing. I don't expect them to clear up any time soon, but I think that a sit down with myself and an exercise in absolute honesty are well past due. Otherwise I will end up compromising on things that I shouldn't and turn out a bitter and miserable old woman.

      Nothing ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them Sometimes I wonder why this is happenin' It's like nothing I can do would distract me when I think of how I shot myself in the back again Cuz from the infinite words I can say I ut all pain you gave to me on display But didn't realize instead of setting it free I Took what I hated and made it a part of me  Never goes away  And now You've become a part of me You'll always be right here You'll always be my fear I can't separate Myself from what I've done Giving up a part of me I've let myself become you  Hearing your name the memories come back again I remember when it started happening I see you n’ every thought I had and then The thoughts slowly found words attached to them And I knew as they escaped away I was committing myself to em n’ everyday I regret saying those things cuz now I see that I Took what I hated and made it a part of me

      So I suppose that it gets to a point where feelings gotta get hurt And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt it goes  Tried to give you warning but everyone ignores me Told you everything loud and clear But nobody’s listening Called to you so clearly but you don’t want to hear me Told you everything loud and clear But nobody’s listening  I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress Head full of anger, held in my chest And everything left’s a waste of time I hate my rhymes, but hate everyone else’s more I’m riding on the back of this pressure Guessing that it’s better I can’t keep myself together Because all of this stress gave me something to write on The pain gave me something I could set my sights on Never forget the blood sweat and tears The uphill struggle over years the fear and Trash talking and the people it was to And the people that started it just like you

      I don’t know who to trust your surprise Everyone feels so far away from me Happy thoughts sift through dust and the lies Trying not to break but I’m so tired of this deceit  Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet All I ever think about is this All the tiring time between And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me  Take everything from the inside and throw it all away Cuz I swear for the last time I won’t trust myself with you  Tension is building inside steadily Everyone feels so far away from me Happy thoughts forcing their way out of me

      It's easier to run Replacing this pain with something numb It's so much easier to go Than face all this pain here all alone  Something has been taken from deep inside of me The secret I've kept locked away no one can ever see Wounds so deep they never show they never go away Like moving pictures in my head for years and years they've played  If I could change I would take back the pain I would Retrace every wrong move that I made I would If I could stand up and take the blame I would If I could take all the shame to the grave I would If I could change I would take back the pain I would Retrace every wrong move that I made I would If I could stand up and take the blame I would I would take all my shame to the grave Just washing it aside All of the helplessness inside Pretending I don't feel misplaced It's so much simpler than change

       My heart was swimming in words gathered by the wind My voice bounded into a cloud-carried tomorrow  My heart trembled in the moon-swayed mirror Soft tears spilled with a stream of stars  Isn't it beautiful? If we could walk, hand in hand, I'd want to go to your town, your home, in your arms I dream of being against your chest my body in your keeping disappearing into the evening  Words halted by wind are a gentle illusion A tomorrow torn by clouds is the voice of a distant place My heart that had been in a moon-blurred mirror that flowed Those stars that trembled and spilled cannot hide my tears  My dream of your face that I softly touch melts in the morning

      What up with self? what up with self? can’t give up no love unless I deal with my own hell-dig, it’s all about Wrecking the age of self-defeat, dignity worth of all human personality, we must belive on our trust potential, our life Has the true meaning and value of now, our only hope today lies in our ability to lift ourselves from this ever-rising Hell! take your life back! give me life to live!

      I don't know exactly what to say. But I'll begin here…  A week ago, my one and only brother passed away. He was riding a motorbike with a friend home after school and got in a hit and run accident.A car grazed their motobike n they fall off the machine.My brother was then run over by a four wheel drives.He suffered a serious injuries.He died on his way to the hospital.  Our entire families and friends were in shocked. Not a single one of us didn't cry at his wake and funeral.  I keep asking the same question: Why did God pick him? Why did he have to die? We'll never know. All I know is God needed an angel to watch over us, and he was the chosen one. He was always smiling, always happy. A very special guyl. I'm having trouble sleeping now, because I keep thinking about him and how it could have been me. Out of everyone, why was it him?Why not me???He just got engaged with his girl friend 4 days b4 the incident..n now each time i look at his fiancee,Ayu..i saw him..smiling at me softly..  My beloved brother,Amee..i shall miss you forever..n no one would ever take your place..but thank you for leaving us your best treasure..Ayu..at least we can ease our pain just by looking at her...as sweet as you  Well, I had to tell someone about this. Thank you for listening.  And please pray for him....

         He sits with me and he shares my life From sun's first smile To night's last gasp. No matter the course of each day's ride Quiet, determined On my shoulder he nests. His face is unseen His name is unknown But his breath and his voice Like the wind Bring me home. Messages from heaven are born on his wings Emboldened with hope Love Rebirth And measureless joy. Enabling me to smile today in the dusk And be ever at peace in tomorrow's sunrise.

      If I knew it would be the last time  that I see you walk out the door,  I would give you a hug and kiss  and call you back for one more.                                                                                                           If I knew it would be the last time  I'd hear your voice lifted up in praise,  I would video tape each action and word,  so I could play them back day after day.                                                                                                            If I knew it would be the last time,  I could spare an extra minute  to stop and say "I love you,"  instead of assuming you would KNOW I do.                                                                                                            If I knew it would be the last time  I would be there to share your day,  Well I'm sure you'll have so many more,  so I can let just this one slip away.                                                                                                            For surely there's always tomorrow  to make up for an oversight,  and we always get a second chance  to make everything just right.                                                                                                             There will always be another day  to say "I love you,"  And certainly there's another chance  to say our "Anything I can do?"                                                                                                              But just in case I might be wrong,  and today is all I get,  I'd like to say how much I love you  and I hope we never forget.                                                                                                              Tomorrow is not promised to anyone,  young or old alike,  And today may be the last chance  you get to hold your loved one tight.                                                                                                              So if you're waiting for tomorrow,  why not do it today?  For if tomorrow never comes,  you'll surely regret the day,                                                                                                              That you didn't take that extra time  for a smile, a hug, or a kiss  and you were too busy to grant someone,  what turned out to be their one last wish.                                                                                                              So hold your loved ones close today,  and whisper in their ear,  Tell them how much you love them  and that you'll always hold them dear                                                                                                              Take time to say "I'm sorry,"  "Please forgive me," "Thank you," or "It's okay."  And if tomorrow never comes,  you'll have no regrets about today.

      Why can't I speak when I have so much to tell? Why can't I write when I have so much in mind? Why can't I sing when there's music in my heart? Why can't I dance when there's rythm in the air?  Too many words left unspoken Too many things left undone Why can't it be and why can't I?  For all I know this pain deep inside Took the gladness from my heart.  Is this the pain of missing you? Is this the reason behind it all?  Hear the agony of my heart Longing for you   Feeling your presences Missing your smiles   When will the waiting ever be over? For as long as we're apart  I can never be whole My Dearest brother Wish I could let you know  That my heart is aching because "I'M MISSING YOU!"

      Here, ever since you gone, If there be change no change I see: I only walk our wonted road, The road is only walk'd by me. Yes; I forgot; a change there is— Was it of that you bade me tell? I catch at times, at times I miss The sight, the tone, I know so well.  Only a month since you stood here? One shortest month? Then tell me why Voices are harsher than they were, And tears are longer ere they dry.

      "Our Fallen Brother"   As I touched him close, I began to cry Wondering and hoping our brother would never die I could feel the whites of his heart,  The wind whisked through as we saw the light     He cried no more as we fell to the ground His one single tear, would never be found Cry not my baby brother, God will take you home The Angels in Heaven will not be alone     You're safe and well as a child to his mother  You will always be remembered as OUR FALLEN BROTHER

      This poem was written in dedication to my brother who was tragically killed in an accident with his friend in Malacca.I was proud that I'm his sister. Sadly he was only 23 years old and will be deeply missed by many.   My brother Amee an awesome guy, I don't know why you had to die. You were so cute as a little boy, You smiled at us and brought us joy.  Even though we had our little fights, Over silly things like phone lines and wiring lights, I never wanted to be a pest, I needed your skills, cause you're the best.  I'm glad those times, were only a few, It was hard for me to argue with you, But that's just me, as you are you, And in the end you always came through.  This is Perlis where you are from, We all are here with Dad and Mom, Our hearts are broken, as you know, We really can't bear to let you go.  Sometimes you were so crazy and loony, Especially with the friends who call you bossy, I know that everyone here will agree with me, That you were the best  Anyone could ever have  We wish so much that you were here, The thought of losing you we couldnt bear It's happy thoughts that will get us through, Like all the fun we shared with you.  And now my poem will come to an end, Until the day we meet again, I pray that you are now at peace. Goodbye Adik With Love From us

      The shock..it numbs my entire body...coats my stomach in nausea, it renders me helpless.  No one ever tells me grief  feels so much like fear...i can  smell it..i can taste it ..and it takes over  my senses...   My Beloved Baby Brother...death cannot separate us..i wish i could turn back time ....so that i can be the perfect Sister to you....i am so sorry for not being there..i keep seeing flashes of snap shots..of you when you were little...you brought us so much joy and happiness...we share our past..but we will not be sharing our future....i have lost my baby brother..i lost my past..present and future....   memories of you will remain  with me..i shall treasure till the end of my life...i hope we will be reunited once again. in the next life....and live happily ever after...   i loved you  so very much that i would trade my life for you...only God knows...God must have a better plan and place for you...   i am overwhelmed with sorrow...it rises out of nowhere..like a wave from the sea..crashes on my shoreline.....sorrow and i are one..until, trailing frothy whitecaps..sweeps away    it has been over a month since his passing, i am still missing him terribly and the feeling will never leave...

      Today is apprently one of the not-so-good-day.....i miss my baby brother so much it hurts ..as i look back over my life, i find that it is very much like a book, sometimes history, sometimes comedy, sometimes tragedy and drama...that's on the good days. other times..it resembles a cheap novel, lots of pages with nothing interesting at all!!  when i examine each individual chapters, i have many mixed feelings..sometimes i found myself wishing i could revisit those times and rewrite my actions or thoughts...but it's the past..it's out of my reach ..how i wish i could conduct my relationship with my loved ones...especially that of my baby brother...the memories of him..i can lift each memory of him tenderly and with affection..i can enfold the volumes, one by one, hold them close, reliving the days i shared with him..  let's face it..we do not live in a vacuum or alone on a desert island, although our pain makes us think we do.  We live as a strand in a web of life that stretches widely and touches many.  what affects us affects others as well. for a time..we aren't sure who has died..the degree of numbness that encompass us makes us feel like there is no life possible without our baby brother...let's not let our grief descends us into the hell of loneliness and depression.  thank you for reading ..this is the only way i can express my sadness as result of the death of my beloved baby brother..there is no way that time will heal this pain....but i take comfort by remembering him..thinking of him and "writing" to him...  TQ .....................when you are tired and discouraged from fruitless efforts..God knows how hard you tried  .........when you've cried so long and your heart is in anguish..God has counted your tears  .......when you're lonely and your friends are too busy even for a phone call....God is by your side  ...when you've tried everything and dont know where to turn..God is the solution..  ...when nothing makes sense and you're confused and frustrated..God has the answer  ..if suddenly your outlook is brighter..and you find traces of hope..God has whispered to you
