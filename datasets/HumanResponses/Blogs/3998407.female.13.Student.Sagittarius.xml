       I think when I'm older I might want to be something like an actress or a model! Probably an actress over a model because I love watching movies and I think playing in them would be even better! I dont think I am too good at acting though but there are schools for that! But being a model would be fun too because I love clothes and shopping! and my sister likes designing clothes! but i think she wants to be an interior designer or an architect though! but if i have no chance at being an actress or model i would like to be a dental hygeineist! that would be cool also! I also think it would be fun to do people's makeup! Just anyone of those four things! but people do say you can do whatever you set your mind to! and I would most likely want to be an actress or a model! ok welll im about to go! c ya l8er!   ~amanda~    &nbsp;

        Hey I am really bored! I'm waiting for the CD I am making to get done. It's for me and Jenny and Rachel&nbsp; to listen to on our way down to portland. It's going to be fun! Rachel is leaving soon though and that's sad! I&nbsp; love the song "Hook line and Sinker" by Billy Talent! My favorite movie is  A Cinderella Story.  Jenny is talking to a guy named Shayne that we met at the warped tour. His band is called  Victory Within.  They are really cool.      bye.      ~amanda~

        I'm really bored right now. Rachel is talking on the phone to nate. Jenny is also but she is online too! I am just testing this out! its kinda cool though! But yes I am bored. Rachel likes Nate and is never&nbsp;going to see him again probably because she lives in Hawaii and says she will move back when she is 18! But, who knows! I have to poop! Today Rachel had her first kiss! I am really happy for her! Jenny, Rachel and I all met Nate Davis at Pierce Collage. Rachel met him for almost the first time. Except she has seen him before, a year before. Then she ended up tounge kissing him on the couch! I'm happy for her! I also saw Stephanie for the first time in a while today. Then my mom, Steph, Rach, Jenn and I, all walked to the park close to my house in&nbsp; Lakewood. We took Pepito with us. Then afterward we walked to Cameron Jergensons house to say hi. Except he wasn't there. He is in Canada right now. Ok I am done for today. Bye.     ~amanda~

       today i woke up at 10:40! then i watched tv for a while and ate breakfast. after that i got beautimus for the day and then watched tv again! then i went on the computer to blog. but i already wrote this all once then the thing messed up soo this is my second time writing this. how fun. well tomorrow sami is goin to cali with her mama. im happy for her! she hasn't quite decided what school she's planning on going to this year but i bet it will be northwood. today she wrote me an email and said that her friend said alot of guys there like her and are planning on asking her out. and she also said that sum girls are jealous of sami and sami doesnt even know who they r. i was like hmm. is that gonna actually convince her to go to northwood. it is sami's mom's turn to have her here for the year and she has been at her dad's for three years in a row. but still she doesnt know. i wonder if she is gonna choose the school where sum guys like her. or the school where her best friend is and i know sum guys will like her here too. and i really wanted to take a dance class after school and have sami going with me. but if she would rather be at a school where girls are jealous of her and boys like her then whatever it is her choice. i am going to write an email to her saying exactly that too. then we will see what she has to say. k good bye...   ~amanda~

        ToDaY i have been really bored! i went to bed last night at 3:00 and then woke up at 11:30! soo i got about the right amount of sleep except my neck really hurts because yesterday I got about 6 feet of air and hurt my neck! I really wish someone would give me a back and neck massage! I could really use one! I so badly want the CD coheed and cambria! Because after Raychal told me last night that she liked this one song by them I decided to download it and see if I like it! and I not only like it but i have heard it before and I love it soo freakin much! For some reason my mom doesnt think I have been honest with her and she doesnt believe me that I didnt read her things under her bed! and I really didnt for sure! My mom says she is giving me 200$ to go school shopping and I'm fine with that as long as my dad gives me like way more! HaHa! I hope soo because I think I want to spend somewhere around 500$ or more! Because you can't buy much with 200$ at the stores i like and can fit into the jeans at! I'm planning on shopping at Abercrombie and Fitch, American Eagle, Pac Sun, Zumiez, Alloy, Wet Seal and who knows where else those are the places I know that I want to shop at though!      **~!~**AmAnDa**~!~**
