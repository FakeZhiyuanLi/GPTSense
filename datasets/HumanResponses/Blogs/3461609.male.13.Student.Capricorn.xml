      Hulk Hogan's Famed Heel Speech from "Bash at the Beach" 1996:   (It's the conclusion of the "Bash at the Beach 1996" Pay-Per-View and Hogan has just shocked the wrestling world by attacking Randy "Macho Man" Savage, thus revealing himself to be the third member of The Outsiders. "Mean" Gene Okerlund Okerlund enters the ring for an interview. Hogan stands beside his new allies, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, as the fans pelt the ring with debris. Tony Schiavone, Bobby "The Brain" Heenan and Dusty Rhodes sit by stunned at the announcer's desk).   Gene Okerlund: Hulk Hogan, what in the world are you thinking?   Hulk Hogan: Mean Gene Okerlund, the first thing that you need to do is to tell these people to shut if you wanna hear what I gotta say.   Gene Okerlund: I have beeen with you for so many years... for you to join up with the likes of these two men absolutely makes me sick to my stomache and I think that these people here and a lot of other people around the world, have had just about enough of this man, this man, (pointing to Nash and Hall) and you want to put yourself in this group? You've got to be ... kidding me!   Hulk Hogan: Well, the first thing you've got to realize, brother, is this right here is the future of wrestling (points to Nash and Hall). You can call this the New World Order of Wrestling, brother.   Gene Okerlund: "You have made the wrong decision, in my opinion!"   Hulk Hogan: Let me tell you something! when it all came to pass, the name Hulk Hogan, the man Hulk Hogan, got bigger than the whole sport! And then Billionaire Ted, Amigo, ... he wanted to "talk turkey" with Hulk Hogan. Billionaire Ted promised me movies, brother, ... Billionaire Ted promised me millions of dollars, brother, ... and Billionaire Ted promised me world calibre matches. As far as Billionaire Ted, Eric Bischoff, and the whole WCW goes, I'm bored brother! That's why these two guys here, the so-called Outsiders, ... these are the men I want as my friends. They're the new blood of professional wrestling, brother, and not only are we going to take over the whole wrestling business, with Hulk Hogan and the new blood, the monster with me, we will destroy everything in our path, Mean Gene Okerlund!   Gene Okerlund: Look at all this crap in the ring! This is what's in the future for you if you want to hang around with the likes of this man, Hall, and this man, Nash.   Hulk Hogan: As far as I'm concerned, all this crap in the ring represents the fans out here. For two years, brother, for two years, I held my head high ... I did everything for the kids ... the reception I got when I came out here ... you fans can stick it, brother, because if it wasn't for Hulk Hogan, you people wouldn't be here. If it wasn't for Hulk Hogan, Eric Bischoff would still be selling meat from a truck in Minneapolis and if it wasn't for Hulk Hogan, all these Johnny-Come-Lately's that you see out here wrestling, wouldn't be here. I was selling out the world, brother, while you were stealing gas to put in the car to get to high school, so the way that it is now, brother, with Hulk Hogan and the New World Organization of Wrestling, brother, me and the new blood by my side ... whatcha gonna do when the New World Organization runs wild on you? Whatcha gonna do????? (He grabs Gene Okerlund)   Gene Okerlund: Hey ... don't touch me!!!! I'm gonna call my lawyer ... Tony, Bobby, Dusty, ... dammit ... let's get back to you!   TONY: All right ... we have seen the end of Hulkamania!!!!! For Bobby "The Brain" Heenan, Dusty Rhodes, Gene Okerlund Okerlund, ... I don't know ... I'm Tony Schiavone, and, Hulk Hogan, ... YOU CAN GO TO HELL!!!!!!! STRAIGHT TO HELL!!!!!!!!!

      Story:   History of the nWo: Scott Hall appears on Nitro promising a "takeover". The next week, Kevin Nash appears and promises the same thing. They attack people for the next month or so (most notably powerbombing Eric Bischoff through a table) until challenged by Sting, Lex Luger, and Randy Savage to a six-man tag at Bash at the Beach. Nash and Hall - at this point only "The Outsiders" - accept, and say their third man will be revealed later.   Hall and Nash are victorious when their third man is revealed to be Hulk Hogan, who over time adopts the new persona of "Hollywood" Hogan. The newly-christened New World Order begins attacking WCW wrestlers viciously. The first new members to arrive are Ted DiBiase (acting as a manager and "money man") and Vincent (acting as "head of security"). At Road Wild, Hollywood Hogan defeats the Giant by cheating outrageously to win the WCW World title. Strangely, the Giant joins the nWo two weeks later, citing the money as his primary reason. Also at Road Wild, the Booty Man tries to join, but is beaten up.   The next member of the nWo appears when they debut a "Fake Sting" at Wargames, who wrestles ittermitently over the next few months until the original Fake Sting, now called "nWo Sting", goes to compete in Japan as part of their version of the nWo. The Nasty Boys try to join the nWo as well, but are beaten up for their trouble. Although he is in fact the seventh member, Sean Waltman joins in November as Syxx.   The nWo announces a "membership drive", giving "all WCW wrestlers" the chance to join the nWo. In order, the wrestlers accepting this offer are Marcus Bagwell (soon redubbed "Buff"), Michael Wallstreet, Big Bubba, and Scott Norton. Also, Eric Bischoff is revealed as being an nWo member around this time, and Masa Chono and the Great Muta, visiting from New Japan Pro Wrestling, join the North American nWo (although they have little effect). At the same time, Giant is kicked out for demanding a title shot from Hulk Hogan.   Randy Savage joins the nWo at SuperBrawl. Newly appointed WCW Commissioner J.J. Dillon says that according to their contracts, Big Bubba and Michael Wallstreet cannot be members of the nWo. Amidst great hype, Dennis Rodman "joins" the nWo, despite wrestling only one match that year as a celebrity guest at Bash at the Beach. Konnan joins the nWo in August. Ted DiBiase quits the nWo and becomes a manager for the Steiner brothers.   Curt Hennig joins the nWo after turning on the Four Horsemen at WarGames. Rick Rude joins in December. Bret Hart is invited to join the nWo, but declines. The Disciple joins sometime in January, although he is not named until March. Dusty Rhodes joins at Souled Out after turning on Larry Zybysko. Bryan Adams joins in January after turning on Bret Hart. Scott Steiner joins in February after turning on his brother Rick. During most of January, Louie Spicolli acts as a flunky to Scott Hall and wears an nWo t-shirt, although he is never "officially" inducted into the nWo before his death. Syxx disappears when Sean Waltman is fired by WCW.   Randy Savage and Kevin Nash, having issues with Hollywood Hogan, form the nWo "splinter faction": nWo Wolfpac. Curt Hennig and Konnan immediately join, as do longtime nWo foes Lex Luger and Sting; they immediately distinguish themselves from the "traditional" nWo (now known as nWo Hollywood or nWo Black-And-White) by wearing black-and-red T-shirts rather than black-and-white. Scott Hall is invited to join the Wolfpac, but refuses. Giant rejoins nWo Hollywood.   Curt Hennig quits the nWo Wolfpac to rejoin nWo Hollywood. Randy Savage is injured and disappears from the Wolfpac. Dennis Rodman once again is trumpeted as a member of the nWo for a celebrity match at Bash At The Beach. Stevie Ray joins nWo Hollywood in September. The Disciple quits nWo Hollywood in October to join the "One Warrior Nation". Horace Hogan joins nWo Hollywood at Halloween Havoc. Bret Hart seemingly joins, quits, and rejoins nWo Hollywood several times during this period, and never wears an nWo shirt or explicitly states his membership in the nWo.   Hollywood Hogan announces his "retirement", and Scott Steiner becomes the leader of nWo Hollywood. Scott Hall is kicked out of nWo Hollywood in November, but despite his efforts is not allowed to join nWo Wolfpac. Disco Inferno starts claiming he is a member of the Wolfpac.   Hollywood Hogan comes out of "retirement" to "beat" Kevin Nash in a thrown match for the WCW World title and reform the nWo as one single entity. The Wolfpac is now an "elite rank" of the nWo: its members are Hollywood Hogan, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Lex Luger, Buff Bagwell, and Scott Steiner. The remainder of the nWo (Giant, Curt Hennig, Vincent, Stevie Ray, Bryan Adams, Scott Norton, and Horace Hogan) continues wearing the black-and-white, while the Wolfpac wears black, white, and red. The Wolfpac also seems to be conducting a gradual elimination of the black-and-white (also referred to as "the nWo B-Team"); at this writing, both the Giant and Curt Hennig have received turfing-out beatdowns, with more likely to come. Konnan has been explicitly kicked out of the nWo entire. Sting's status is unknown. Bret Hart's nWo membership is entirely forgotten.   With Scott Hall in retirement, Hulk Hogan back in semi-retirement, and Bagwell turfed from the group, the only members left are Lex Luger, Kevin Nash and Scott Steiner, and possibly Disco Inferno. Steiner and Nash rarely do anything nWo-related (besides use the Wolfpac music). The nWo black-and-white is whittled down to Vincent, Horace Hogan, Stevie Ray and Bryan Adams, with Scott Norton doing his own thing without the nWo name. Soon after, Horace Hogan is fired, Bryan Adams is repackaged, Stevie Ray leaves to reform Harlem Heat, and Vincent joins the West Texas Rednecks, thus finally ending the group’s legacy once and for all.   The concept was originally started by Scott Hall, who "invaded" WCW on the first two-hour Nitro in May of 1996 (see "Monday Night Wars") and declared that they were taking over, although he didn't note who "they" were. The implication was that is was a WWF takeover, which led to a later lawsuit and was publicly denied by Hall at the "Great American Bash" PPV in 1996. Kevin Nash joined him two weeks after he debuted, and the two of them promised a third man at the "Bash at the Beach" PPV in July. The third man was Hulk Hogan, who coined the phrase "New World Order" during his heel turn interview, although in a nebulous and roundabout way. Commentators Bobby Heenan and Larry Zbyzsko later officially named them the nWo, building on Hogan's speech, and the rest is history

      The company now known as WCW existed for years before as both Georgia Championship Wrestling and Mid-Atantic Championship Wrestling. The two companies were both under Jim Crockett Promotions and so amounted to being the same thing, despite the different names.   In November, 1988, Jim Crockett sold Jim Crockett Promotions to WTBS. Crockett promotions had been the promotion most widely associated with the NWA. In order to distance itself from the NWA, which still existed as a paper organization at the time, WTBS began to change the name of its titles and television programs from NWA to WCW. The change took place in late 1990. By January, 1991, the WCW name was fully in place and the NWA name was all but dropped by the organization.   WCW was formerally owned by Time-Warner and WTBS. Ted Turner, although a majority stock holder in Time-Warner, is NOT the sole owner of WCW following the merger last year between Turner and Time-Warner. The position in WTBS most widely considered as being in control of the wrestling promotion is the Executive Vice President in charge of Wrestling Operations. This title is currently held by Eric Bischoff, and has been reportedly changed to "The President of WCW," which means the same thing but pays better. In recent years Jim Herd, K. Allen Frey and Bill Watts have been in that position. Ric Flair's position as "President" is merely part of the storyline. He has no real power within the company.   Isn't WCW just another name for the NWA? No. Absolutely not. The confusion comes from several sources: 1) The seamless transition on WCW TV, 2) The propaganda spread by WCW, 3) WCW and the NWA had the same champions for a six month period, 4) By 1991, WCW had almost completely taken over the NWA.   WCW was formerly the Mid-Atlantic region, as well as the Georgia region, both of which were under the NWA banner. As they grew, they became the only major portion of the NWA to have TV coverage, and thus the NWA became Mid-Atlantic in the minds of the fans. This was patently wrong from the start, as the NWA was in fact many organizations under one banner.   The rapid loss of World Class, the UWF, Florida and Portland left Mid-Atlantic (WCW) as the sole major player in the NWA by 1988, which is the point at which Ted Turner purchased Crockett Promotions and the NWA unofficially died.   On 01/01/1991, WCW officially dropped the NWA name entirely and operated without a World champion or World tag team champions for a period of 10 days. They continued to recognize the Mid-Atlantic version of the NWA US title, which was held by Lex Luger at that point, as well as the Mid-Atlantic version of the NWA World TV title, which was held by Tom Zenk. These two titles were renamed the WCW US title and WCW TV title, respectively, and have direct lineage to the original NWA versions of the titles.   On 01/11/1991, Ric Flair defeated Sting to win the NWA World title, and immediately after WCW named him as the first WCW World champion. It cannot be pointed out strongly enough at this point that these were TWO DIFFERENT TITLES. Ric Flair was simultaneously NWA and WCW World champion, and one title did not follow from the other. The WCW World title was created completely separate from the NWA World title and has NO direct lineage to the NWA World title, aside from the fact that the NWA champion happened to be the first WCW champion.   The same situation existed with the tag team titles, as WCW created the WCW World tag team title at the same time, awarding them to Butch Reed and Ron Simmons, the current NWA World tag team champions. Again, this was a separate championship. However, because no distinct break ever occurred to distinguish the two belts, it was assumed that one simply became the other, when in fact this is PATENTLY untrue. However, the NWA was reinstated in 1992 and WCW World tag team champions Steve Williams and Terry Gordy captured the NWA World tag team titles in a tournament final, thus unifying the two championships and giving the WCW World tag team titles a direct lineage to the NWA World tag team titles once again. The lineage exists only from 1992 on, however. For simplicity's sake, one is assumed all the way back to the NWA World tag team title's creation, although this is factually incorrect, despite being easier to deal with.   The NWA World title is a different story, however. In 1992, after the re-creation of the NWA, Masa Chono was established as NWA World champion. His reign, and those of the Great Muta and Barry Windham are regarded as legitimate World titles. WCW pulled out of the NWA for good in 1993, however, which rendered the "NWA World championship" being defended in WCW totally meaningless. When Ric Flair, as WCW World champion defeated Sting, the WCW "International World champion", to "unify" the titles, it actually unified nothing, as the NWA had died many months prior to this match.   In short, WCW is not the NWA and never was. WCW's World titles were created in 1991, and there is simply no lineage to the NWA from before that. No matter how much believers of the opposing viewpoint may scream their opinion on the matter, the FACTS are as presented above. The constant claims of lineage back to 1904/1905 by WCW are simply lies used to solidify a heritage that does not exist.   "The Powers That Be" are the collective name for Vince Russo, Ed Ferrera and Bill Banks, the creative team signed away from the WWF to replace the departing Eric Bischoff. In storyline terms, it mainly refers to ringleader and meglomaniacal head booker Vince Russo, who is only seen from the side as a menacing arm and a New York accent.   Essentially, Vince Russo was given the reins of the WWF in May of 1997 after being the editor of the WWF magazine for a few years previous. He had been sitting in on booking meetings and progressively adding ideas, until finally the job was his entirely. Ed Ferrera was added in 1998 as a writing partner, and Bill Banks went with them as an associate when they left, although he had no significant input in the WWF during that period. Russo & Ferrera functioned as a team from 1997-1999.   On March 26, 2001, WWF/E Chairman, Vince McMahon, appeared on NITRO for the very first time and announced that the WWF/E has purchased WCW from Time-Warner/AOL.
