      "Will has this poster on his bedroom wall. It was there the first time I ever went into Will’s room and it’s there now. It’s a grainy picture of what appears to be a UFO flying over some generic wooded area that is almost certainly in the American midwest. Beneath the UFO, in stark, white capitals, is the legend:  I BELIEVE . I have been staring at this for perhaps twenty minutes now, vaguely aware that Will and Daisy are playing videogames without me. Will is trying to teach her the fundamentals of  Resident Evil , which is really not that tough a proposition. See zombie, kill zombie. See puzzle, solve puzzle. But there’s a world of difference between growing up on videogames and coming to a Playstation 2 for the first time in your early twenties to play a complex and reasonably plotted game on a controller which, on first glance, has an awful lot of buttons. I suspect this is what’s causing Will to roll around in my peripheral vision, laughing so hard he can barely breathe.  I keep seeing that stone in my mind’s eye, bouncing away across the sea. I keep thinking of that Christmas holiday when Neil and I did nothing but play  Super Mario Kart  and talk about the things we were starting to feel. So many words and emotions passed between us that it’s impossible not to believe that some part of him will always be in me. It was with Neil that I first watched  Dawn Of The Dead  and the  Evil Dead  films, with Neil that I played my first videogames, with Neil that I first discussed girls in any kind of sexual context. We went through those times together, he and I against a world we were only just beginning to hate. We were bonded, you understand, for all time.  But it’s the stone I can’t shake from my mind. That stone and all the stones before it. The sea, of course. I don’t know what power it had over us, but we always went there in times of crisis. I think maybe we just went to watch the awesome power of something larger than any problems we could ever have, something inexorable and permanent. Perhaps there was something soothing in that, the same way there is something soothing in the image of Venus for me now.    Neil and I stood beneath the same grey sky and watched the same grey sea time and time again. In Clacton and in Eastbourne. We never spoke until someone, usually me, thought it was time to go. It wasn’t something we talked about or analysed, it was more primitive than that. It was something we just did.    I can’t help but climb inside Neil’s mind. It kills me, but I can’t help it.  I BELIEVE . Neil never did. Rather than fight some losing battle, he took himself out of the world and into the place inside his head. But the world, like the sea, is inexorable. You can’t escape forever. Sooner or later, the world gets us all. I see Neil realising this simple fact in a flash of insight that’s so typical of him and typical of me. We were forever missing the huge and obvious. He realises and he takes a decision of similar proportions. He switches off his computers, his TV, his hi-fi, his PC. He gets dressed. He walks out of the house and through the town, brushing past the tourists and the lemmings. They never really existed for Neil. He walks down to the beach and he stands on the uneven surface of the stones, staring out at that place where the sea meets the sky and fucks up your perception of everything. Maybe he remembers like I remember. Maybe he thinks of me skimming stones while he stood beside me with no ambition but to stare at the invisible horizon and wonder just what it meant. I think he knows that I’ll know. It’s possible he even hopes I know. No-one else will. In Neil’s world, there is nothing but Neil and Sean.    He walks down to the edge of the ocean as I did just a few days later. To an observer, he’s just another lost soul, I suppose. Just another guy looking for that perfect stone. But Neil doesn’t look for a stone and Neil doesn’t watch the waves as they slowly climb the beach.    Neil just keeps on walking."

        Another late night in front of the computer. Early morning, I should say. I guess I should enjoy this solitude while it lasts. I'll be back into some crummy job and back out in the world within a week or so, and that'll be the end of these long nights spent in the company only of Mr. Jack and my ever-growing web of internet friends.  The internet's a funny thing, eh? I've been coming online, on and off, for about six years now, and in that time I've made several lasting friendships and encountered all manner of weirdness. It certainly isn't like the world outside The Darkened Room, that's for sure. In fact, I like to think of it as a  part  of The Darkened Room, crammed into this tiny space like cotton wool into a bottle.    And that's all I can be arsed to type at the moment. I'll post some fiction to make up for it shortly.

      Baritone screaming, Necessary gear change, Uphill labours don’t bother that suit too much, Down now, An endless path, Opaque borders, An occasional glimpse to the sea, Depth concealed in sunshine   jewellery box infinity, Life presented in a box complete with promotional material, Silence crowned king of our awkward parade until eulogy forces comparison for ego to usurp, Like always I could scream.

        Meh. Just gone 6pm and I'm feeling like an oxymoron.  Yeah...exhausted  and  angry make for strange bedfellows. I'm pissed off, but I can't actually summon up the necessary energy to work myself into a proper rage. So I'm having a drink instead. Presenting Mr. Jack, the solution to all of life's problems.  Back to the saga of my grandfather, if I may. He's still alive, though the old bastard appears to be running on little more than rage at this point. That isn't as inspiring as it may sound...  I'll explain: On Monday night, we were told that grandad was going to die, that it was just a matter of time. At the hospital, they asked my mother if she'd prefer that this happen at the hospital or the nursing home. She chose the hospital, believing that they'd offer the best in palliative care.  This was before the sick realities of the NHS were brought home to us.  My grandad's problems are numerous and make for pretty uncomfortable reading. Aside from the three strokes that have destroyed his physical and mental capability, he has bedsores that have been so neglected by the staff of the nursing home that they have become huge and infected. He also has a urinary infection. He cannot eat or drink. He isn't at all coherent. I have a sneaking suspicion that he may not be able to see either. When you talk to him, his eyes don't focus on you. He always seems to be looking in your general direction rather than straight at you.  All of these things, combined with his age and his various ailments, should have killed him by now. They should have killed him on Monday. Yet, for some reason, the hospital took it upon themselves to keep him alive via a drip and a course of antibiotics. I am not totally against this, as I appreciate the fact that they're legally obliged to try and keep him alive if the means are there.  What bothers me is this: The treatment he has received has marginally improved his condition. He is no longer critical. Still in pain, still close to death, yet no longer critical. When the course of antibiotics ends early next week, they intend to send him back to the nursing home. Drips are not allowed in a nursing home and he will no longer be on any medication. They will neglect him again and he will not eat or drink. It'll be a matter of time before he collapses again, becomes critical, and they send him back to the hospital...and so on, and so on...  And there you have the reality of the NHS. An eighty-nine year old man on the verge of death and clearly suffering is being treated like a collection of symptoms instead of a person. The NHS has no human reality. It's all about freeing up beds and treating illnesses rather than people.  What a genuinely fucked-up and tragic state of affairs.

      Odd day today. I got up late and lay around vegetating, listening to Maroon 5 and Something Corporate whilst making a few phonecalls and just generally making no effort to do anything constructive whatsoever.  Then I decided to stay in and watch the football rather than hit the pub. More in-depth stuff on football in another blog whenever. It was a good game. England won 4-2, which means we qualify from our group and go on to face Portugal in the quarter finals, a game I think we might lose. It was weird, though. I tend to get caught up in football, but I was vaguely aware of several phonecalls going on downstairs and of my parents going out. Later, my stepdad came back alone, which is pretty unusual. They go everywhere together when they're not working.  So England's fourth goal has just gone in, and I'm cheering because it was Frank Lampard and he plays for my team (Chelsea). My Stepdad calls his appreciation for the goal up the stairs and then there's this long silence. I sort of know that he's still there, that he's going to say something else.  And he does. My mum's rushed off because my grandad's just had another stroke...and it looks like this one will be his third and last. The guy's ninety and he's totally done in. Death would, at this point, be a mercy. My mother would rather I stay here than go to the hospital, and that's fine with me. I don't want to see him suffering and I hope it doesn't go on much longer. He's never going to recover and live a normal life, even if he gets through this one. It seems pointless to drag it out for him now.  I spoke to my mum on the phone a little while ago, which wasn't pleasant. She was pretty choked up, and my mum isn't one for tears. This can only mean the worst I think. But in a way, I hope the next phonecall is the one that says he's gone. No-one should ever have to suffer so much for so long.  More later, I suppose, when I know what's going on and feel like dredging all this awful death stuff up from the depths of my psyche...

      Nearly 6am and time's passing in slow motion. This computer screen is burning itself into my retinas. I dream of it sometimes. Write and surf the 'net all night and then have nightmares about doing it when I actually get to sleep.  And I sleep rarely these days. My insomnia's getting worse. Sometimes I just sit up all night and then don't go to bed at all. I hide under my blankets as the sun comes up and lie there thinking about the stuff I would do today if I didn't sleep through it. This bugs me. I like my dark existence, but not many services cater for the casual insomniac. Sometimes I need to get my hair cut or pay some money into the bank or buy CDs or whatever. Can't do this stuff at night. I get to thinking about how my hair is developing a life of its own. I get to thinking about just how much I want to buy some old Fiona Apple CD. Finally, I get out of bed and go out.  Any insomniacs out there ever do that? It's a fucked up thing. The daylight world takes on a whole new look when painted in shades of insomnia. It's too bright. Everything seems to move too slowly. You stare at things like you're stoned. You have to concentrate to understand, and just when you think you've grasped it, you realise that your brain's run on ahead of you and you've actually unconsciously analysed and processed the thing already. A simple thing like a McDonald's logo suddenly becomes something to be feared, a focus for some hate you lack the coherence to define.  My sleeping troubles make me drink. It balances me out, chemically speaking. Jack Daniel is my best friend when I'm all fucked up and spun out. He shows me the way back to synchronicity, gets my head to where my body is so that I can feel whole again.  Tired now. Really tired. No rest last night and a long day on top of it. I think I might even sleep. Hooray. More twisted sunshine dreams of darkness and monitor-light.  Or maybe not. The hair monster is raging out of control and may devour me while I sleep. This would be bad, I think. Maybe I should take a zombie shuffle over to the hairdressers before the sun steals the last of my sense.  Then again, maybe I should just get some fucking sleep.  Right.

      It seems fitting to begin with a day spent  outside  The Darkened Room, on a weird expedition with my parents and my stepsister to the wilds of East London, where we 'did lunch' with my proper sister, walked about in the rain a lot, and generally spent more time on the tube than we did actually doing anything.  All this was, apparently, to celebrate my 25th birthday. Which was appropriate, I think. Nothing like seeing in your quarter century with a belated celebration that mainly involved stumbling around the drab, rainswept streets of East London. Especially when the day as a whole was basically an exercise in gritting my teeth and trying not to say what I was thinking. After all, everyone else seemed to be enjoying themselves. Or at least trying to. Who am I to begrudge my kin these moments of togetherness?  Woah...hold on there just a second. This isn't going to be one of those 'alienated loner' blogs. Fuck all that. I  like  my family sometimes. Occasionally, I even love them. They just make me want to chew my thumbs off.  All of which is neither here nor there as far as my debut blog entry is concerned. No, this was going to be a little introduction to my world and to the mind that's actually sitting here typing this stuff. Only now that I think about it, that'd be pretty bland, too. Better to let the thing evolve, let the stories come as seems appropriate. This is my space. No-one else is going to be editing it or checking I'm following the correct structure, so I guess I can just cut loose, and consequences be damned.  It's all about the birthday, friends. It's all about reaching the grand age of twenty-five and realising with a clear and perfect horror that - amongst my circle of friends and acquaintances - I'm the only one that can't check a single box in the "Things You're Supposed To Be Achieving As An Adult In The Year Of Our Lord 2004" column of the Big Questionnaire.   I'm single, and have been for nearly a year at the time of writing. As of last Thursday, I am unemployed. I have no desire to either own or rent property of any kind, unless we count The Darkened Room, which is not so much a place to live as a nest to retreat to, like some kind of injured mongoose hissing at the predators outside...  Shit, do mongooses nest? Do they hiss? Is it mongooses or mongeese? And why did I choose such a stupid fucking metaphor?  Whatever. Back to my quarter-life crisis and back to the strange and horrible visions I've been having, visions where my friends shake their heads sadly and say things like "When are you going to get a job, Mike?" and "My wife has this cousin. Maybe you two should go out or something. You might hit it off".   Terrifying. People starting to believe that you are incapable of planning your own life...then starting to plan it for you, to offer what they think is helpful advice, little realising that all their example is doing is feeding the flames.   I'd best add a disclaimer to that section, too, seeing as I'm not planning on gunning down my happy friends, nor setting fire to them, their loved ones, and their possessions. I think about it sometimes, but only when I'm in a really  good  mood.  I want to be a writer. No, really. The comedy stopped just a second ago. That's how I came to be here. I keep quitting jobs and have a total inability to hold down a steady relationship because these things aren't, right now, my number one priority. I've written a bunch of screenplays and short stories and even poetry. I finished a novel last summer and I'm currently working on a second. None of these things have been published, as far as I know, but I'm getting to the point where I may just be able to write something saleable  and  cool.   Which is what I most want from my life and what I've been planning with a surety and structure that would terrify my parents and my happy friends if they could see and understand it. I mean, if I applied the same determination and passion to, say, becoming an ice cream man, you'd be looking at Mr. Whippy by now. But they don't see that because the process of honing an artistic talent into something worthwhile takes an awful lot of the kind of practice that produces no concrete result. Hence, many people around me believe that I'm actually doing nothing at all except wasting away in a series of bar jobs and dumping every promising ladyfriend I ever meet for no good reason.  Which is true, in a way. But fuck them. They are wrong and I am right. It is necessary that things be this way.

      Good evening, readers. Allow me to light another cigarette and position a bottle of Jack within arm's reach so that we can get down to business. Because I've got that feeling, friends, that familiar feeling that tells me something rank is going down out there. I can almost see it, almost  taste  it. It's everywhere; vomited out of televisions and radios; from the mouths of our politicians and our entertainers and our social commentators; wriggling down the wires that link this globalised, multimedia generation like some tired and apathetic chain-gang.  But look a little closer. Look beneath the surface of these apparently stagnant waters and  see . We're all together now. Our generation has an opportunity like no other. Any one of us can reach out from behind our screens and throw our words down those same wires. We can seize that great, dark space of unfulfilled potential as a sound seizes silence. We can fill that void with a million dissenting voices, a collection of whispers that could surely become a scream.    plu·ral·ism: n. - The condition of being multiple or plural.   Some have said that this best describes the world we live in today, with its drive towards globalisation and its leaders so obviously in the grip of multiple special interest groups and wealthy friends. But it defines the world in another way, too. It defines  us . Yes,   us  . The Great Unwashed. The Many-Headed Apathy Beast that skulks in the shadows of organised society and might strike fear into the hearts of those very same leaders were it ever able to realise the power it wields.   "No one knows who will live in this cage in the future, or whether at the end of this tremendous development entirely new prophets will arise, or there will be a great rebirth of old ideas and ideals or, if neither, mechanized petrification embellished with a sort of convulsive self-importance. For of the last stage of this cultural development, it might well be truly said: 'Specialists without spirit, sensualists without heart; this nullity imagines that it has obtained a level of civilization never before achieved."   Max Weber wrote those words in 1904. Now, as that quote celebrates its centenary, Mr. Weber is perilously close to being proved right. Every word you don't say, every opinion you don't express, every vote you don't cast...all of these things contribute to the state we've found ourselves in. As I've said time and time again, we're trapped in the cycle of the postmodern age, an era defined by its very repetitiveness. The snake eats its own tail and - the way things are now - it always will. Forever and ever, amen.  It's in your hands. It's in my hands. This is our world and this is our time. There are no saviours and there are no new revelations. There is only now. To borrow a cliched sentiment, we have to  seize the day .  I don't know what it is that compels me to write these things, just as I don't know what it is that makes people read them. All I know is that I'm driven to communicate, and communication is a two-way street.  I've thrown my feelings at you, so throw yours at me. Write to me. Give me your thoughts and feelings. Give me  you . Let's get something going here, whether it be lively debate or tearful lament, lunatic comedy or frightening truth.   Carpe  fucking  diem .

      I watched  28 Days Later  tonight. Got me thinking...  I've been big on movies for many years. I've spent a lot of my adult life working in and around film. I've been a cinema manager, a projectionist, and even a film journalist. I love the movies. I love escapism. I love that feeling you get when a film just takes you away, makes you forget the trivial details of your own life. Most of all, I have a bittersweet romance with that feeling you get after you've been to the cinema and seen a film that really got to you, and then afterwards, as you walk out into the street and back into reality, it almost seems as if it is this that is the fantasy.   28 Days Later  touched a nerve with me. I've got a thing about post-apocalyptic stories. If you're up with this blog, then you've probably picked up the impression that I am not, generally speaking, in love with the world around me. And if you did, well, congratulations. I'm not the alienated loner I've so casually derided in other posts, but I do struggle to be a social creature sometimes. I guess it's a constant battle. Half of me adores company, the other half basically hates the human race as a whole and believes the world would be a far better place without us.  This could be a long post. I could go into my politics and my feelings and all kinds of other things. From the starting point of that one movie, I could pretty much touch base with everything that bothers me and everything I value. I'm not going to. Not right here and not right now. But it's an interesting point to make. It's also an interesting lead into what's on my mind.  If I could, briefly, be political and philosophical... I think my post-apocalyptic fantasies stem from a feeling that it's all over, that the era we live in represents the end of history. The postmodern age is a cycle I'm not sure we can escape from. As a global culture, we've become shallow and tired. At this point in time, the general  zeitgeist  is a feeling that it's all been done, that all the great political theories have been used up. It's a drift towards the centre, towards that place where most of the people get at least part of what they want and most of the great fights have been settled by compromise. It's a place where we find our entertainment in satire and homage, where everything harks back to something else. It's a nod and a wink and a knowing smile that exists only to mask the desperation that lurks behind it.  It's the eternal wait for some punchline that isn't coming.  Given all that, an apocalypse might be kind of fun, no? You wake up one morning, and something terrible has happened. Everything's gone. All the things you took for granted have been taken away from you. It's a world that's more or less empty, a world of quiet anarchy. No more governments, no more laws, no more Democracy. Suddenly it's all about survival and - if you live that long - finding some way to start again.  I guess that appeals to me because I wouldn't feel as helpless and impotent as I am in this society. First comes anarchy, a chance to be out in a world where all is crisis. A chance to meet those that survive on entirely new terms. Suddenly you're outside of the cage. Suddenly the rules have changed. In a scenario like that, everybody goes back to basics, to the things that make them who they are, to the feelings and thoughts and traits and insecurites that define them. You have a chance to see these people as they truly are, rather than as mannequins whose emotions are dressed up by a culture that thrives on victims and competition.  Initially, apocalypse would destroy that urge to compete. In terms of survival, luxuries like gas and electricity would be gone, while food and water would be plentiful. Traditional institutions like school, family, the media, and the church would have been wiped out. Their doctrines would last, of course, but it wouldn't take a genius to figure out that these were the very things that had brought us to this point...and that these things could no longer do anything for us.  No more careers. No more work. An end to that philosophy that has us all performing like monkeys, struggling desperately to find a place for ourselves in a world where the reward is financial, where success is based on material possession.  I'll be honest. I would love a world like that. And if 99% of the population had been wiped out to make it happen? Well...what could you do? It would be the past, a thing you were powerless to prevent. Better to move on, to finally  evolve .  Evolution. Where would we go? What would we do? It would take time to re-organise, to get to a point where some kind of structure could be built. That part of me that still believes in people likes to think that we would come up with something different...but what that might be is another post for another time.  Of course,  28 Days Later  had zombies. So did another of my post-apocalyptic fantasies, George Romero's  Dawn Of The Dead . Even Stephen King's  The Stand  had a dark demon that gathered only the 'evil' people of the world to be his army.  Heh. That's the other part of my movie-fantasy. Just give me a pump-action shotgun and point me in the right direction, will ya?

      I woke up much earlier than usual this morning. The sun was shining directly into my window and through the curtains I'd neglected to close, almost blinding me as I clutched my churning stomach and tried to ignore the pain in my head.   My leaving party was last night. Too much to drink. Vague memories of being driven home by Vanessa and making her stop on the motorway because I needed to piss.  My first words, spoken in the old man croak of the chain-smoker: "What the fuck?"  Directly beneath the window, resting ominously on my computer chair, was a large papier mache sculpture of The Mekon's head. I vaguely remembered being presented with this as one of my gifts, along with a scythe (an honest-to-God SCYTHE, ladies and gentlemen) and a T-shirt that read "We are the pod people from Gaddesden Row" that I wore with pride.  I suppose I should explain these bizarre presents. The job I just quit was as assistant manager in a country pub called The Old Chequers. Working there was a strange and evil time in my life, and my days were filled with all manner of weird country folk who looked with disapproval and horror on my city-boy ways.  I hated a lot of the customers. Hated them with a passion. In fact, I was often heard voicing the opinion that I was trapped in the village from  Invasion Of The Body Snatchers , and that I had to get out before they finally got to me and I was turned into a Pod Person (That'd be the T-shirt explained).  I dealt with these fears by requesting weapons to keep behind the bar. Every time my boss went to cash and carry on a Saturday morning, he would ask me if I wanted anything.  "A machine gun to mount on the counter," I would cheerfully reply. "A broadsword." "A baseball bat." "A taser." And, "A scythe."  For some reason, the scythe thing bashed a gong in my mind and I began to ask for one repeatedly, adding that I would also like a hooded cape so that I could serve the customers dressed as Death. I never believed they would actually comply with these lunatic requests, but last night, I was presented with the bar-weapon of my dreams. Which ruled.  As for The Mekon, well, if you're not familiar with the chap, here's a visual aid...     In May of this year, I hadn't taken a sick day for over four years. I rarely get ill, and when I do it's usually minor and passes quickly. But when I came down with the flu last month, I got hit hard, so hard that I could barely get out of bed. I was living in at the pub, so all I had to do was stagger downstairs and let one of the managers know I wasn't feeling up to working.  When the pub closed that night, I went downstairs to talk to Chris and Vanessa (the couple that run The Chequers). Vanessa casually remarked that, when I'd come down and told her I wasn't feeling well, my head had actually looked swollen. Chris, being a big fan of comics, immediately seized on this and began calling me The Mekon. For some odd reason, this caught on, and I toyed with the idea of writing online under that name. Clearly overjoyed at this prospect, Chris began leaving pictures of the saucer-riding alien in various locations around the bar. This artistic stalking obviously reached its nadir last night, when he presented me with the giant papier mache head.  Genius.  Back to the main thrust of this post, which is the fact that - when I woke up this morning - The Darkened Room stank so strongly of paint that it was making me feel ill. This same paint, I quickly realised, was on my hands and even my face, and had stained both my clothes and my blankets. I had clearly been attacked by The Mekon while I slept, and there was only one thing left to do...  Which, in a nutshell, is how I came to slay that big-headed xenophobe fuck with a scythe.

      Christ. Suddenly it's 6:30 in the morning and another day has slipped past without any sleep. I'll be listing clinical insomnia on my CV soon, as a practiced talent and qualification.  The hair monster was supposed to be slain today, only I lacked the necessary energy to stagger down to the hairdressers, so I cancelled my appointment. I did, however, find the stamina to nip over to the off-license and grab a bottle of Jack and a couple of packets of cigarettes. These are gone already, and the thought worries me.  Hi, my name's Michael, and my future is cancer-ridden alcoholism.  This is the problem with the early mornings. They're just an all-around fucking downer for me. My body's aching but my brain is just coming back up to speed after the dead time between midnight and five or so. If I'd forced myself into bed then, I might have had a chance of crashing, of finding oblivion and hanging out there for a day or so. That's what tends to happen to me if I can get myself in a position to sleep when my system finally gets itself into a state of synchronised exhaustion. I just crash out for something like fifteen hours.  Still, at least I got a lot of work done today, most of it on a surreal piece of science fiction lunacy entitled  Deliria . When not working on that and drinking heavily, I was surfing vaguely around and chatting to friends. I also took the time to tidy up and streamline my profile at Everyone's Connected, one of many sites I'm a member of. You can find my funky words and pictures  urlLink here .  That'll do for today, I think. I'm off to read for a bit and see if I can trick my brain into thinking I'm staying up while secretly plotting to go to bed.  Shhhhh.

       Time to introduce a new idea to The Darkened Room, I think. We appear to be short on rage, satire, and black comedy. Here are all three, in the shape of my first Hate Fable. A rather twisted little piece of writing, this blog is probably the only place it's ever going to fit.   Vicky's desk was a monument to everything that was wrong with early twenty-first century society. Several things made this obvious. First, there were the permanent decorations: A picture of Vicky and her best friend Nikki, smiling and poking their tongues out at the camera. This image had been placed inside a garish yellow frame patterned with orange flowers. Just below the photos were the words 'nutty tart'. Next to this work of evil, just in front of Vicky's computer, was a small plaque. "You don't have to be mad to work here," it smirked, "but it helps"  Temporarily sharing desk-space with these monstrosities were a mug and a pile of magazines. The mug contained a tea of the variety that claims to be fruit-based but actually tastes the way your saliva might if you'd just spent the morning chewing on a piece of cardboard. The magazines all had names that ended in exclamation marks.  Wow! Yes! Me! Her! You! Us!  They all had celebrities on their covers. They all featured stories about a new miracle diet.  Vicky had just recieved a text message from Nikki. "OMG!!!" it had shrieked. "tht blke i met last nite is str8!!!" Now she was sitting bolt upright in her seat, staring straight ahead as mental calculations beyond the ken of the sane were carried out behind her blank, empty eyes.  Suddenly, Vicky leapt up from behind her desk and ran out of her office. Moments later, she ran back in and grabbed a compact mirror from her handbag. Satisfied that her make-up was intact, she ran from the room again.  Ricky, an advertising executive for the  Rowr!  range of men's beauty products, was on the phone to Mickey, the editor of the popular men's magazine  Pumped , when Vicky burst into his office waving her mobile phone, words tumbling out of her mouth so quickly that he could make no sense of what she was saying.  "Hang on a sec, Mickey. Vicky?" he said, pressing the phone to one chiselled, tanned, and fashionably stubbled cheek.  "I've got it, Ricky!" screamed Vicky. "Is that Mickey? Tell him we've got a new angle he's going to love!"  Ricky looked nonplussed. "Are you listening to this, Mickey? Go ahead, Vicky."  "The Metrosexual," said Vicky, and giggled.  "What?" said Ricky.  "What?" said Mickey.  "The Metrosexual," repeated Vicky. "See, it sounds just like heterosexual. It's a way of applying the success of the gay man to the homophobe market."  "Go on," said Ricky. He was beginning to smile.  "Well, the image of the gay man is becoming more and more prominent in the media," Vicky said. "Increasingly, women's magazines, along with shows like  Sex And The City  and  Will And Grace  are making the understanding and amusing gay man the must-have accessory of the early noughties for any right-thinking independent woman. This image has proved so successful that it's now expanding into new markets. Look at  Queer Eye For The Straight Guy , for example. Gay men making straight men into objects of desire by virtue of the fact that they have better taste and are more in tune with what women want!"  "So the Metrosexual is...what?" Mickey asked Ricky.  "I was just about to ask the same question," Ricky said. "Vicky? What  is  the Metrosexual?"  "The Metrosexual is a male, gay or straight or whatever, that cares about the way he looks and keeps up with the latest fashions and beauty products in the same way as a woman or a gay man! It's like The New Man all over again, but with a catchier label and a wave of  zeitgeist  to surf in on!"  Ricky was impressed. He hadn't known that Vicky had mastered the use of simile and knew words like  zeitgeist .  "Mickey?" he said.  "I like it," said Mickey. "In fact, I'll get someone on it for the next issue."  "Fantastic," said Ricky, smiling at Vicky. "This could be the perfect hook to hang our new range of  Rowr!  products on."  Vicky left  Rowr!  Towers that day feeling elated. She checked herself in the compact mirror as she stepped up to the kerb to hail a cab, realising with a civilised degree of panic that the blowjob she'd just given Ricky to seal her promotion had done more damage to her lipstick than she'd thought.  The bus driver didn't see the woman standing on the kerb. He was too busy staring at a billboard advertising the latest SuperBra by demonstrating just how ineffectual it was at keeping the model's ample breasts from falling out of it.  The bus, which carried an advertisement for a  Sex And The City  DVD on its side, did not hit Vicky. However, it passed close enough so that, just as she reached up to retouch her lipstick, its wing mirror clipped her elbow, shoving her hand against her face and the tube of lipstick into her mouth. It became lodged in her throat and she choked to death.  On the day that Vicky's funeral attracted a crowd of mourners that looked  incredibly  chic in black,  Pumped  magazine introduced the concept of the Metrosexual, and a million stupid, alienated men went out and brought into a 'whole new lifestyle'.  Mickey and Ricky both acquired vast wealth. The former also acquired a debilitating crack habit, while the latter achieved a brief period of tabloid notoriety later that year, when he was found dead in a hotel room. Ricky had apparently choked to death whilst masturbating over a picture of Justin Timberlake and attempting auto-asphyxiation using a tie decorated with pictures of Looney Tunes characters.   The moral of the story?  There is justice in the world, but it has a lousy sense of timing .

      Early mornings and the smell of burning coal. Winter's cold hand  dancing just a few feet in front of my face, occasionally darting forward to touch the tip of my nose or slap life into my cheeks. Every forgotten word is a glorious pattern of warm breath into freezing air, rising into a sky coloured the perfect blue of memory.  You took me walking almost every day. But it's the winter mornings I remember. They were ours and ours alone. We'd wrap ourselves in coats and scarves and set out to challenge the cold once again; your slow, easy stride making a mockery of my tripping, stumbling run. In a world that forced me to grow up so fast, you were always able to make me feel like the child I ached to be. Even now, I smile to think of your ponderous grace.  You were a mapmaker to me. God's own cartographer. You seemed to know a thousand different routes to a thousand different places. You exist in a soft-focus, storybook part of my mind, where every journey was a new adventure and we never visited the same place twice.  The words are gone now. I can't bring back those stories you'd tell me. They're lost in that soundless place between the cadence of your accent and the ceaseless rhythm of your feet.  The words, but not the meaning. The meaning is in every frozen morning that takes me out of this darkened room and onto the streets of my past, in the shock of a body resuscitated by the cleansing gasps of winter, in the scent of every chimney breathing warmth into that forever blue above.  I can always find peace in these places, and as long as you live in my memory, I hope that you can too. I love you. Thank you. Goodbye.

        "Do not listen to a word I say. Just listen to what I can keep silent."    I keep going to write something really personal here, and I keep not being able to do it. Funny, isn't it? I can rant at length about politics and imaginary sporting conspiracies. I can tell you what I did today. I can show my poetry and my fictionalised feelings. But can I really say anything about myself that doesn't involve the reader having to read between the lines or make some kind of interpretation? I'm not sure I can. Nothing I'd want to read, anyway.  Still, it's bothering me. For the last three nights there's been a thought gnawing on my brain, and the longer I don't express it in some form, the more it swells, growing fat and pregnant with smaller ideas and thoughts, inspiring followers and enemies until I feel as though there's some kind of shouting match going on behind my eyes. And then, finally, I have to scream. If only to drown them out.  I've always thought of my writing as a scream. Sometimes it's a scream of grief, sometimes of frustration, sometimes of laughter. But it's always a scream. It's always a release of something I no longer wish to hold onto.  I wonder if I spend too much time hiding. I wonder if I haven't rationalised that part of myself to such an extent that I'm beginning to believe that I really am alone. That's not a pleasant thought, but I can't find much of an argument against it anymore. Days like today just feel abstract to me, like I'm not here at all. I measure my time in words and cigarettes and whiskey. I'm listless hieroglyphics floating in a room lit only by the fluorescence of this screen.  Turning twenty-five has filled my mind with speculation and adventure. But at the same time, I've found myself taken with an eerie nostalgia for the way I felt when I was younger. Ten years ago, I could care. Ten years ago, I could make a statement like "I really am alone" and not feel stupid and vain. Simpler emotions, simpler times. I didn't have to analyse then. What I felt was my truth. I could cry like no-one was looking.  It's good to be back in civilisation. Out in Gaddesden Row, I'd look out the window on a cloudy night and see an inky blackness that was frightening in its totality. No sounds out there, no people. Here, I keep my computer by the window and draw back the nets when I'm writing. I can look out and marvel at the way the clouds reflect the clusters of artificial light below, how we make gods of these simple, plastic things.  Perspective. Less than an hour ago I was cycling beneath those very same clouds, trying to ride some of this frustration out of my system. I was pushing hard, winding my body out as far as it would go, letting the muscles stretch and protest while my tar-sick lungs suddenly found themselves overdosing on oxygen. I love that kick, when everything's suddenly super-heated and I'm way out on the edge, challenging and then passing previous limits until stars dance before my eyes and I feel like I might just collapse; flesh and metal entangled on asphalt; the bleeding, sweating epiphany of adrenaline.  I never let it get to that stage, though. As with everything else, I know my absolute limits as well as I know the theoretical. And it was there, cresting a hill and relaxing as I let momentum take me over it, that I found the real epiphany. Silence on this normally busy road. My breathing, my heartbeat, the baritone hum of the wheels completing revolution after revolution. But silence, really. Darkness, really. Sudden and massive sadness found in the tarmac beneath me, solid and endless and given life only by those same lights I like to watch touch the clouds. Debris, the things we cast away without ever really thinking about it. It's everywhere, forgotten and neglected except for those precious moments where a glancing blow from the light exposes a twisted can, the silvery insides of a wrapper, glass scattered in random configurations like memories of the impact that left them there.  Desolate beauty in these things, yes. But also sadness. Too many metaphors. I feel overwhelmed and yet still no tears. I've forgotten how to cry. What are you if you can't cry?   And this, I think, is for Daisy. Because I'd never have written these words if I hadn't read hers.

      It's way past time The Darkened Room exposed its paranoid secrets to its ARMY of readers. And if you're not interested in paranoid secrets, then  urlLink fuck you .  If the summer of 2004 leaves me with one lasting impression, it'll be that all professional sports are rigged. Yes, rigged. Fixed. Set-up. A con.  A small percentage of you gasped just then. And to be honest, I quite enjoyed it.  But back to the subject in hand, rather than the object. Take a look at this sporting weekend. Yesterday, we had Maria Sharapova winning the ladies singles title at the Wimbledon tennis championships. Nothing wrong with that, I hear you cry.  But there is. Ohhh yes.  You see, for some strange reason that has nothing to do with her being pretty, blonde, and seventeen, British tabloid  The Sun  had adopted young Maria and taken her under its  urlLink slightly sweaty wing  during Wimbledon fortnight, and this makes me slightly suspicious of her victory.  Why? Well, there are two reasons. The first involves the parallels you can draw between Sharapova and Anna Kournikova, another tennis starlet  The Sun  loved to photograph shoving balls up her skirt. You see, for the last couple of years before Kournikova's retirement,  The Sun  ran a feature called Kourna Corner. No,  urlLink really . For the duration of Anna's stay in the tournament, those heavy-breathing journos would publish a picture of her, preferably one of those where her knickers were showing.  Of course, seeing as Kournikova was crap and never actually got very far at Wimbledon, this feature didn't have the longevity that the editors clearly would have liked. So, my theory is that they replaced Kournikova with a younger, prettier model, and then set it up so that she would stay in the tournament as long as possible. And as long as possible, friends, means winning.  You know it's true. Sharapova's a stick insect and Serena Williams is clearly AN EVIL TENNIS ROBOT of some kind. Look at the two of them, for Christ's sake. It's a fix. If Serena REALLY served a tennis ball and Sharapova attempted to return it, the laws of physics dictate that she would, at the very least, lose an arm.  A pox on you, Rupert Murdoch.  Oh, and there's more. Yup. Three more sporting events of some note are going down tomorrow. There's the French grand prix, which I GUARANTEE you Schumacher will win. And there's the Euro 2004 final, which Portugal will win. There's also the small matter of the men's singles final at Wimbledon, which Roger Federer will win.  That Euro 2004 final. Greece versus Portugal. It's awfully STORYBOOK, wouldn't you say? Do you remember what the first game of the entire tournament was? Greece Vs Portugal. Do you remember who won? That's right, the plucky underdogs overcame the might of the host nation. Then, by some miracle, the plucky underdogs made it all the way to the final where they'll face...the host nation.  Oh, spare me. This is making utter bollocks into an art form. Portugal win tomorrow night, thereby both avenging their defeat at the hands of Greece (who are crap at football) and giving maximum publicity to the HOME side and especially their mincing winger, Cristiano Ronaldo, who is clearly going to be the new big thing in football. You couldn't make it up. Or *cue dramatic music* could you?  As for Federer and Schumacher. CONSPIRACY. Why? I don't know. But it is. Trust me. I have an understanding of these things. The truth isn't out there. It's in here.

      So I get an e-mail tonight from a guy at  urlLink this website  saying that they want to publish one of my stories. Online, I mean, but they actually put out print anthologies every year.  Unexpected, I have to say. I'm not exactly in the business of writing erotic fiction.  But I do, now and again, mostly to amuse myself and a small but select group of friends. What happened on this particular occasion was that the story,  Fitz And Me , had quite an impact on my little readership. So much so that I was urged to try and get it published.  Which I did, by sending it to  urlLink The Erotic Review , a fairly high quality magazine published here in the UK. About two months later, they wrote back to let me know that, although my submission was appreciated, they hadn't read it and didn't have time to read it. People to see and places to go, don't you know?  I have no problem with rejection. If you've ever attempted to write for publication, then you'll know that your early years are going to be spent staring at a fat pile of rejection slips and letters. What pissed me off about this one was its tone. That and the fact that they'd rejected me for no apparent reason. They hadn't even looked at the piece.  So I touted it around a little, more out of pique than anything else, and ended up submitting it to the site linked above. They got back to me first to say that it had passed the first stage of their screening procedure, and then to let me know that they wanted it. Yes, I have in my hotmail inbox that rare beast, a letter that says I'm talented and that someone actually wants to do something with my work.  I feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Especially seeing as I am now, officially, a porn peddler.

      I'm losing my motivation. I should get back into some kind of work next week. I know I should. I just don't seem to be able to pull myself together. All I've done for the past two weeks is sit around in The Darkened Room, thinking about my future while steadily working my way through packets of Marlboro and bottles of Jack that now litter the floor. This place is beginning to look like a slow and deeply satisfying suicide.  Plans. I plan to travel either late this year or early next. My original idea was to do the States and then see how I felt about further travel. Obviously, I don't have a great deal of money to my name, so I'd intended to support myself by working as I went. I now realise that this can't happen due to the ridiculous and inflexible US laws regarding the granting of visas.  I could still travel the States, but I'd have to do it illegally.  I'm not sure how I feel about that. On the one hand, it seems pretty commonplace. But on the other, I don't want to find myself in a situation where I can no longer travel because I'm out of money and can't find anybody who'll pay me under the counter for some crummy bar job.  Australia is much easier. As is Canada. I think I'll end up taking whichever is the simplest option in terms of a place to begin. I'm not an experienced traveller and - until I am - trying to work illegally in a foreign country when I have virtually no knowledge to draw on in the event of mishaps strikes me as both stupid and counter-productive. I want to get away from this country and this life, not put myself in a situation where I could potentially be deported straight back into it.  No. I think it's more prudent to ignore the pleas of my American friends. They want to see me and I want to see them. But I don't want to jeopardise my long-term goals by going about it in a stupid way. There's making large-scale changes to your life and then there's just being reckless. The difference between the two is massive.  Then again, I still have much to learn on the subject, so I'll have to keep my mind open. Right now, though, I'm not sure I'll be going where I originally intended.  What  is  this grand plan, anyway? I don't think I've fully articulated it to myself, never mind anybody else. All I know is what I've learned through my life experiences. I've learned I can't work a regular job. I've learned that I have no career aspirations whatsoever beyond my hopes of being a published writer someday. I've learned that I don't fit here, that I don't live in a country I could ever call home.  So, in its basic form, the plan is to save enough money to get out of the country. From there, I'd travel around as much as possible, supporting myself by working as I go. This would hopefully give my creative side the fresh input it so desperately craves, adding new dimensions to my writing and giving me different perspectives with which to write about entirely new things.  All sounds good in theory, doesn't it?

      I've slept for almost sixteen hours in the last two days. This should be a good thing, but I feel like death. I've got the mother and father of all headaches and I don't feel like doing much except...well...sleeping.  &nbsp;  I am unwell.  &nbsp;  But never mind, eh? I think I'll dash off a quick blog entry and then return to my bed. Thanks for all the feedback on my political screed, by the way. I'll try and respond to it either later on or tomorrow.  &nbsp;  As for today, it's more stuff you didn't know about me, plus a book review.  &nbsp;  I'm not sure when I first saw Bruce Campbell act. Once I was a fan, I realised that I'd seen a hell of a lot of movies that featured the man without actually recognising him. The film that caught my attention, though, was  Army Of Darkness . If you're unfamiliar with the third of the  Evil Dead  films, then I'll lay it out for you as simply as possible.  AOD  is a hammy and exceedingly stupid film with a ludicrous plot. It is largely populated by cardboard characters and unconvincing special effects. However, director Sam Raimi (who would go on to become one of the most famous helmers in the world) is quite clearly aware of this, as are the cast, and the resulting movie is a ninety minute riot of slapstick comedy, cheap horror, and brutally funny one-liners.  &nbsp;  Undisputed star of the show is Bruce Campbell as anti-hero Ash, who completes his journey from the wide-eyed innocent of  The Evil Dead  to a chauvinistic, arrogant, wise-cracking bastard who tucks the entire movie into his back pocket with such ease that it's actually titled on the credits as  Bruce Campbell Vs. Army Of Darkness .  &nbsp;  If you haven't seen any of the  Evil Dead  films, then you're missing out on one of the&nbsp;quirkiest franchises the horror genre has ever seen. None of the films are especially frightening, but they are very well made (on very small budgets) and freguently hilarious.  &nbsp;  Anyway, now you know about my penchant for low budget comedy horror, let's get onto the book.  &nbsp;  Unlike other books of this type,  If Chins Could Kill  makes for an engrossing read. Campbell's writing voice is easy, engaging, and full of wry self-deprecation. Even when he's not discussing the films you bought the book to read about, Bruce brings his world to life in a convincing and warm fashion that draws smiles and occasionally laughs.    &nbsp;  Obviously, Campbell's readership was always going to consist mainly of the fans he describes as 'deadites', as well as a healthy smattering of folk who got into shows like  Hercules  and  Xena: Warrior Princess , both of which featured Campbell as Autolycus, the king of thieves. But it does have an appeal that extends beyond those limited demographics. Indeed, Campbell offers a perspective on Hollywood and the life of an actor that is somewhere between your average lovefest of a biography and the more violent attacks on Hollywood from&nbsp;the likes of&nbsp;Julia Phillips and Robert Evans. He does rant, but his infrequent attacks are neither venomous nor full of jealous bile. Rather, you imagine Campbell telling these tales with a smile and perhaps the occasional shake of his head at the ridiculousness of it all.  &nbsp;  Of course,  ICCK  is also full of the kind of details that fans are going to love to read, charting not only his own decidedly unmeteoric rise to fame, but also those of his friends, including Raimi, producer Robert Tapert, and The Coen brothers. From the original  Evil Dead  to the success of  Spiderman , much of the&nbsp;ground is covered, and Campbell always finds the time to praise or smirk at the work of others, peppering his experiences with amusing tales of practical jokes and lasting friendships.  &nbsp;  Ultimately,  If Chins Could Kill  is a funny and warm-hearted book that makes for an easy and fascinating&nbsp;read, especially if you're familiar with Bruce Campbell and his strange body of work. In the 'all-new' section at the end, a description of the 'Chins Across America' tour Campbell embarked on to promote to book, he hints at a sequel.&nbsp;If it's as enjoyable as this, I hope he gets around to writing it.

Why fuck around? If we're going to write an essay, let's do it right, eh?  Yes, I have already written this post. Yes, I did lose it when Blogger closed down for maintenance the other night and I hadn't read the front page. No, this one couldn't possibly be as good as that one. I'm dead sober, for one thing. But I'll give it the old college try, and we'll see what we end up with.  &nbsp;  This rant has come about for a&nbsp;couple of reasons. First, because people keep asking me about my politics. Second, because reading Jenn's blog left me&nbsp;feeling slightly guilty that I'd made no attempt to cover politics here.      &nbsp;  With good reason, I might add. I don't cover straight politics because I don't see the point. From the feedback I've had so far, people prefer it when I just write about whatever's in my head, preferably fictionalising it in some form. The demand seems&nbsp;to be for bittersweet tales about my life or whatever else. The people&nbsp;want to be entertained. And politics is  not  entertaining.  &nbsp;  But I'll do it now, if only so it means I'll never have to do it again.  &nbsp;  My educational&nbsp;background is in politics and sociology, by the way, so I do occasionally have some idea what I'm talking about. If I'm slipping, I'll throw in some oral sex gags. I'll be sure to highlight them in bold for you scrollers.  &nbsp;  Oral sex  gags . Hahahahahahaaaa! See what I did there? Damn, I'm funny. And serious, too. Watch this...  &nbsp;  I'll begin with Blair and Bush, but I'm not going to say&nbsp;very much&nbsp;about them because that would be to miss the same point I'm tired of watching everybody else miss. Right now, it doesn't actually matter who the incumbent is in terms of public office. A choice between Blair and Michael Howard is no choice at all. Ultimately, they represent pretty much the same thing. Same with Bush and Kerry, when you get right down to it. The only reason you'd vote the opposition into power right now is because they're the lesser of two evils. It's not so much a matter of voting  for  as  against . That's why I believe Western Democracy is a sham.  &nbsp;  Yes, a sham. A waste of time. An oxymoron. Who am I going to vote for in the next general election. Blair? I think not. He's a liar and a thief and a breaker of promises. Howard? He's a Tory. I grew up in a single parent family during the eighties. I would sooner die than vote Conservative. Kennedy? Ahahaha...ahahaha...haha...heh.  &nbsp;  Ever notice how Charles Kennedy looks like that kid at school who would hide under the stairs and look up skirts?  &nbsp;  The Lib-Dems just can't seem to grasp the concepts of post-millenium politics, and that's why they will never be a viable third party in this country. We're locked into a two-party trip now, just like our friends on the other side of the Atlantic, and with the same problems. The chief of which is apathy.  &nbsp;  More people voted during the 2001 edition of  Big Brother  than in the general election that same year. In fact, 2001 saw the lowest turnout in a general election since before World War I. The reasons for this are as obvious as they are worrying. When Blair's New Labour kicked the Conservatives out of office in 1997, they did so in landslide style. By 2001, the Conservatives were only just beginning to get themselves back together. The election was seen as a&nbsp;foregone conclusion, and nobody bothered to go out and vote. The prophecy was fulfilled with another landslide.  &nbsp;  In the next election, I believe the same thing will happen. One reason is the belief that the Conservatives can't win. But is that all there is to it? I think not.  &nbsp;  You'd have to be either ignorant or blind not to see that politics has undergone a drastic change in the last twenty to thirty years. The modern age was all about polarisation and experimentation. It was about Left and Right. It was, in a way, several generations of people trying to find Something That Worked.  &nbsp;  Nothing did. The extreme left was destroyed by the disastrous failure of Marxist theory when put into practice. The extreme right gave us the holocaust. As the last century staggered to a conclusion, England saw more moderate versions of both extremes, in the Labour government of the late seventies and the reign of Thatcherism through the eighties. Both left the electorate discontented, and when the time came for change, polarisation became a thing of the past.  &nbsp;  Politics, however, did not.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Hunter S. Thompson calls politics the 'art of controlling your environment'. I believe this is key to an understanding of Post-Millenium Democracy. Tony Blair&nbsp;and New Labour are in charge of this country now because&nbsp;they were&nbsp;in the right place at the right time. But&nbsp;they're also there because they had the right image and the right policies. Consider this: If politics is the art of controlling your environment, then  understanding  your environment is everything. New Labour did this spectacularly in the years 1996 and 1997, and that's why they destroyed the Conservatives so comprehensively in the election that followed.  &nbsp;  English culture is undergoing something of an Americanisation, and has been for a good few decades. In fact, if we're going to call this thing Post-Millenium Democracy, then we may as well use millenial terminology. I think it's fair to say that globalisation = Americanisation. Both culturally and politically, the USA is the most powerful and influential nation on earth. If it comes to pass that someday we are one world with an international language and culture, we will all be Americans. I don't see that as a radical piece of thinking. In fact, I think it's pretty obvious.  &nbsp;  Jerry, Sally, Oprah, Montell, Ricki. There are five names from a larger list that I believe are responsible for the rise of The Celebrity Victim. Don't get me wrong, I'm not holding the hosts personally responsible for the content of the shows, but they're still getting rich off the backs of a bunch of stupid, ignorant people who'll do anything to get their fifteen minutes of fame. These shows are also responsible for the rise of the  Big Brother s and the  Pop Idol s and the  Fame Academy s and the hundreds of derivative reality TV shows that now flood our screens and fill our newspapers with stories about minor celebrities and talentless, pointless nobodies copping off with other talentless, pointless nobodies.  &nbsp;  And the general public  wants to see it . The ratings don't lie, folks. If you're seeing more and more of these shows popping up on your screens, chances are it's because they're working.  Big Brother , as I pointed out way back at the beginning of this essay, encourages more interaction than a general election.  &nbsp;  But these are symptoms of the problem and cultural phenomena that help to perpetuate it. They're not the problem itself. Let me run a theory by you...  &nbsp;  Ever watch Jerry or Oprah or any of those programmes? I'm sure you have. Everyone's seen at least one episode of one victim show at least once in their lives. Have you ever noticed how the audience at these shows is almost always composed of about 99% minority groups?  &nbsp;  Why is that?  &nbsp;  Let's take that curious (and highly generalised) statistic in the context of the current political climate, shall we? Polarisation is out. Left and Right are out. The political ground to be&nbsp;contested is the Centre. It's all about pleasing most of the people, most of the time. Principles can go hang. So, for your 'great unwashed', for your mass of politically uneducated and uninterested voters, what is there? Why would they vote? Nothing's going to change for them, for  us ,&nbsp;regardless of how the next election turns out. It simply doesn't matter.  &nbsp;  Over a century ago, sociologist Max Weber took issue with the theories of Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim. Where they had believed that all action was necessarily dictated by structure, Weber hypothesised that this was not so, and that there were other influences. In order to make my point, I'm going to call on Weber's theories to a certain extent. I'm not going to explain them in grand detail. If you're interested, you're on the internet, for Christ's sake. Look it up.  &nbsp;  Whereas Marx and Durkheim essentially saw all action as structure-related, Weber thought there were different types of actions. Two of these were  rational action  and  affective action . The definitions are fairly obvious. Rational action&nbsp;is defined by structural and societal norms. People acting within these norms are acting - as far as the rest of us are concerned - rationally. People acting affectively, on the other hand, are very much into an emotional trip. They're reacting with the heart rather than the head, if you like.  &nbsp;  Two of the&nbsp;key norms of postmodern Capitalism are individualism and competitiveness. Traditionally, these are defined in monetary terms. But what happens in a society where the people no longer believe that they're suddenly going to get rich? Or that hard work&nbsp;won't&nbsp;necessarily lead to success? Or that their gender or their race or their status dooms them to a life predestined?  &nbsp;  Maybe...maybe they'd be brought up with different kinds of competitiveness. If their culture was based on individuality, on victims, and on the fairytales of TV soap operas and talk shows, what forms might that competitiveness take?  &nbsp;  We're all victims now. We're all subordinate to our childhoods, to our insecurities and the various forms of depression that have become so widespread. We're our own soap opera characters, and each of us wants to be the star of the show we call life. Our rational action is to follow the norms of the day, the structures of Capitalism that are (and always will be) dominant. Our affective action is to live in a fantasy world because of the frustration we feel at not being able to control our environment. It's a retreat into a world where we can have some kind of status, that of the Victim. It's a chance to be the centre of attention.  &nbsp;  To return to Blair, his timing was a thing of beauty.&nbsp;To a society losing its faith in politics and theory whilst embracing full-on globalisation and our new multimedia society, he was almost the ultimate politician. His policies were easy to understand. They were moderate. They were not the old working class rhetoric of the Labour party, and they were certainly not the domain of the Tories. They were safe, and they were delivered by a young, good-looking (for a politician) man with a toothpaste-ad smile and awesome public speaking ability. Between that and the disenchantment of the electorate, Blair couldn't and can't lose. Now that the second party is finally understanding and attempting to play catch-up, everyone's a moderate. Again, no choice. Party dealignment is the order of the day. There's nothing to identify with anymore, no theories to relate to. It becomes a matter of which middle-aged guy we prefer. It's  Big Brother: Midlife Crisis Edition .  &nbsp;  Of course, there are still causes out there. Problem is, there are  too many  of them. Moderate politics, as I've said, pleases as many people as it can, as often as it can. None of these causes is going to lead to a revolution, because none of them - from the&nbsp;viewpoint of Western society in 2004 - is important enough. Those fights that have always had social importance; gender, race, and sexuality, have largely been settled by compromise. They've been given just enough to wipe out the radical elements.  &nbsp;  If you're Tony Blair, you could conceivably be Prime Minister until the public gets sick of the sight of you. Your place in the Bumper Book Of Political History is assured. If Politics is the art of controlling your environment, then you da man.  &nbsp;  In an odd&nbsp;way, I respect that.  &nbsp;  But my voice is one amongst many. These are speculative theories that may mean nothing at all. I grew up ignorant, came to politics via Karl Marx, and then slowly worked my way through books and essays and my own experiences to come to the conclusions I'm drawing here. And you know, even if they're wrong, I'm left with the same feeling. I'm a non-believer. I'm an outsider. I don't really have a lot of time for any of this, and I'd rather construct my own elaborate theories than listen to anybody else's.  &nbsp;  No choice. No future. No faith. These are the reasons I'm so full of hate. The only conclusion I can draw is this...  &nbsp;  ...It's a world of blindess and blandness, friends. And it's not going to change anytime soon. It's a self-perpetuating nightmare. It's a snake that eats its own tail.  &nbsp;  Welcome to forever.  &nbsp;  ( Insert oral sex gag here )

        "Life does not cease to be funny when people die any more than it ceases to be serious when people laugh."    &nbsp; I tried to go to bed early last night, but when you're someone who struggles to sleep in the first place, it's never going to be easy. This was how I came to be sitting on my windowsill at half past three this morning, throwing coins at a couple of cats that were yowling in the back garden. &nbsp; Mum knocked on my door just before eight, yelling at me to get up. &nbsp; "We're not going to be late!" she&nbsp;screeched, and stomped off downstairs. &nbsp; I thought about telling her that I'm never late for anything, that I've been doing full-time work for more than six years and have&nbsp;never been pulled up on my punctuality. But&nbsp;it seemed pointless. She was still  hysterically normal , and liable to&nbsp;make some casual and incredibly sick comment about death by way of reply. &nbsp; So I dragged myself out of bed&nbsp;and got ready without comment, a process that was&nbsp;somewhat slowed by the fact that a) I went out and got drunk with my cousins last night, and b) I could no longer get into my suit. &nbsp; "I'm twenty-five!" I muttered to myself,&nbsp;unable to comprehend the evidence of my own eyes. "How the fuck can I still be growing?" &nbsp; But I am, and the suit that fit me perfectly two years ago looked like some kind of comedy outfit, with sleeves that ended just below the&nbsp;elbow&nbsp;and trousers that wouldn't fasten. &nbsp; Remember kids: Unemployment makes you fat. &nbsp; I quickly came up with a substitute pair of trousers and swapped my suit jacket for a long leather coat. I wasn't sure grandad would  entirely  approve of my turning up to his funeral looking like a gangster, but there was no time for fucking around. We were already late. &nbsp; Though not as late as my older sister. Cath's tardiness is&nbsp;near-legendary, and today was no exception. Mum, Steve&nbsp;(my stepdad) and I were supposed to follow the funeral cars to the church, but because of Cath's bizarre reliance on the Thameslink Thunderbolt from King's Cross to Borehamwood, we ended up having to drop mum off early while Steve and I went to pick&nbsp;her up.&nbsp;This resulted in us screaming through Borehamwood at something like&nbsp;two-hundred miles an hour in order to get to the service before it started. &nbsp; Which we did, and with time to spare. So much time, in fact, that we even managed to get ourselves involved in the Pre-Funeral Mingle, which is that strange time when you stand outside the church and play Spot The Family Member You Haven't Seen In Ten Years.&nbsp;I got much nodding and smiling done, and even managed to keep my laughter in check when one distant aunt remarked, "My, haven't you  grown!"   I'm not going to describe the mechanics of a&nbsp;Catholic funeral. You're either familiar with them or you're not, and I haven't the inclination to go through the motions of a ceremony I have little time for. I'm not a Catholic. I was never baptised. I don't believe in God, and I think that organised religion is one of the world's great evils. I may talk about my relationship with God another time, but let's leave it out of this story, eh?  The church service passed without incident, though I was somewhat disturbed to look over at my little cousin, Robert, and see him bawling his eyes out. He's roughly the age I was when my father died. The relationship isn't as close as that one, I know, but he's already a really introverted kid. When you're just hitting puberty, events like these can make or break you.  Sheena (my aunt and Robert's mother) was rather curt with me as we filed out of the church. I don't think she approved of the fact that I didn't take the Holy Communion or&nbsp;kneel when requested to. It may have been the fact that I was the only one who didn't&nbsp;go down on my knees&nbsp;at the first time of asking. At the second, quite a few people joined me in remaining seated. Whoops. I guess I could have explained that my intent was not so much to undermine the Catholic Church as to see off my grandfather in my own fashion, but I'm not sure she'd have got it. This, after all, is a woman that sent her kids to a Catholic school. I consider that a crime. Then&nbsp;we were off to the crematorium, and the part of the day I was dreading the most. I think Cath may have sensed&nbsp;my discomfort, because she raised the subject in the car and then immediately dropped it, going off on a wild tangent about what songs Steve and I would want played at our funeral. Steve plumped for Hendrix's  Little Wing ,&nbsp;showing&nbsp;far more taste than stepfathers are allowed. I went for  After Hours , by the Velvet Underground, one of my&nbsp;favourite insomnia songs and a sure-fire hit at any funeral. &nbsp; And then, finally, I was back in the place where my innocence began to die.  &nbsp; The South&nbsp;Chapel at Garston crematorium is neither large nor spectacular. It's a small room that&nbsp;would seat about thirty people on uncomfortable&nbsp;benches. Decoration is sparse,&nbsp;and the colour scheme is basic.&nbsp;White, brown, and gold, in&nbsp;order of prominence. &nbsp; The coffin was brought in and laid just behind a set of parted&nbsp;curtains, and I knew then when the moment of tears would be.&nbsp;When those curtains,&nbsp;slow and automated and so fucking  final , draw closed, that's when you truly realise that someone is gone, that you're never going to see them or speak to them or hear them laugh again. &nbsp; God, memories. I was only fourteen. Sitting in that same chapel&nbsp;beside my sister and trying not to cry. &nbsp; It&nbsp;wasn't  his &nbsp;day, though. I was reminded of that by the sound of my mother crying, and I glanced up to the ceiling, blinking water out of my eyes and trying to concentrate on what the priest was saying. &nbsp; The service was short and sad. The curtains were closed and my grandad departed to wherever it is you believe people go when they&nbsp;pass&nbsp;on. He'd have approved of the send-off, I think, and that's all that really matters. &nbsp; We&nbsp;stumbled, all of us, out of the crematorium. A little grief-stricken, a little choked. I caught up with mum and put an arm around her. She cried into my shoulder and it was enough, I think. Enough to release the hysteria for her, enough&nbsp;for me to show that I care, even though I'm so&nbsp;fucking awful&nbsp;at showing it sometimes. Something of a catharsis, that moment, and it&nbsp;made the next part just that little bit easier to bear. &nbsp; The three of us walked away from the others and over to the memorial plaques. Just me, my mother, and my sister. My real family. The ones I've grown up with. The ones I understand. We found my father's name and stood there awhile. Small talk gave way to silence. A few more ghosts were laid to rest. We walked back. &nbsp; That was the end, really. We all went back to Sheena's house and had a few drinks. I caught up with my relatives and endured all the jokes about my unemployment and my drinking and smoking. I wasn't really listening, to be perfectly honest. I felt a weariness I haven't felt in a while. I felt drained, empty. I stayed a few hours and then slipped away and home, where I fell&nbsp;into a deep&nbsp;and untroubled sleep&nbsp;as soon as my head found&nbsp;a pillow.

        "The wise man can pick up a grain of sand and envision a whole universe. But the stupid man will just lie down on some seaweed and roll around until he's completely draped in it. Then he'll stand up and go, 'Hey, I'm Vine Man.'"    Before I get onto the main business of the evening, I'd like to thank the people who have linked to my little page and/or told their friends that I 'rock like a mofo'. Or words to that effect. They are the reason (other than my shameless trolling) that my hits appear to have doubled in the last couple of days.  So, like in the movie  Pay It Foward  (only without the annoying kid and the stupid, senseless ending), I thought I'd take a little time out of my day to pimp the folk I enjoy reading.   urlLink Life, In A Nutshell  is Jessica's blog. I don't know Jessica personally, but she's got a pretty good grasp of the words for one so young. Also, she's got an endless library of quotes and culture references that have a tendency to make me giggle.   urlLink Crippled Henry  is Jason's alter-ego and also the title of his blog. Jason's speciality appears to be short, strange, and often amusing screenplays, though he does occasionally veer off into poetry and some startlingly good prose. You should go read him.  Once upon a time, in what feels like another life,  urlLink Daisy  was one of my employees. Reading her blog for the first time made me sniff a little and pretend my hayfever was getting bad. That's a recommendation, by the way.  Chris shares his thoughts with the world in  urlLink From A Whisper To A Scream . I ended up reading his blog one evening because the title reminded me of the Manic Street Preachers song  La Tristesse Durera . Chris puts the words together in a way that makes me keep reading. His blog covers a random assortment of subjects, and occasionally renews my belief in the human race.  Jenn's blog,  urlLink Scars Of Tomorrow Show The Lies Of Today , is a recent discovery. Flitting from politics to term papers via an eclectic selection of influences, this one's well worth your time. It's also the most frequently updated blog I've ever read.   urlLink The Saturday Boy  is the homepage/blog of author Ray Banks and his fictional private investigator, Cal Innes. Not only is Ray a shit-hot writer with a bright future, but he also once dragged a semi-conscious Michael from the toilets of a Newcastle pub when I'd had one too many shandies.   urlLink Softcore Sewing: Season 1  is a group blog that dips into pretty much every aspect of blogging, from looking at current events to pointing and laughing at stupid celebrities. And I'm sure they'd want me to tell you that they also make quilts...naked.  Each of these pages is worth a little of your time and you can always find them (and more, hopefully) in The Honour Roll just below my outbound links. So read them, engage in lively debate with them, send them e-mails about your personal problems, leave dead animals on their doorsteps...the possibilities are endless. Endless, I tell you.

        "It was the Law of the Sea, they said. Civilization ends at the waterline. Beyond that, we all enter the food chain, and not always right at the top."    I wonder what makes the Blogger people think that I actually  read  their front page. Then again, maybe they knew. Maybe it was a warning.  "Don't fuck with us, newbie," they were probably saying. "You'll read our front page, or you'll get some more of  this ."   This  being the sheer horror of going to post a very lengthy essay I wrote last night and finding that the server was closed for maintenance.   The essay was called  The Politics Of Weakness , and it combined the best of my socio-political thought with the worst of my drunken rambling. It was, I thought, an excellent little piece of work. And now I don't seem to able to retrieve it. 4,000 words. 4,000  good  words. Gone. Bastards.  If I get bored enough later, I may make an attempt to replicate that essay. But don't hold your breath.  Onward, my friends, onward...  Something strange is happening to my sinuses. No, really. I've had sinus problems for many years, but nothing like what I'm currently going through. For example, I woke up this afternoon to what sounded like some kind of CREAKING going on inside my head. This noise was accompanied by a sensation I would imagine is quite similar to what you'd feel if you were at the dentist's and the assistant tripped up and that sucky tube they use to dry out your mouth went straight up your nose and stabbed you in the brain...and it was still switched on.  This went on for a couple of minutes, and then there was a loud pop. Again, this was only inside my head. It didn't hurt, but I did feel very disoriented and strange. After all, I'd suddenly developed SUPER-HEARING. That's right, from what appear to be regulation ears, I now have the ability to hear a fly rubbing its legs together from several miles away.  Clearly, my sinuses must have been blocked before. Blocked for so long, in fact, that not being able to hear had become normal. Weird.  Other news? Why not?  My grandfather's funeral is tomorrow, and my entire family has officially gone insane, particularly my mum. She seems almost  hysterically normal , if that makes any sense. She's Soap Opera Normal, and it's beginning to freak me out.   Mum : "I suggested Garston. I remember it from when your dad died. It was such a nice place?"  Me : " Nice ? It's a fucking crematorium."  That was a couple of days ago. This next's one's from just now.   Mum : "I'm going to the chapel of rest with Sheena [My aunt and, obviously, the queen of the jungle]. Do you want to come?"  Me : (Low-level horror) No.  Mum : "Okay. We went yesterday, you know. He doesn't look too bad. Some of them don't look very good."  Me : "If you went yesterday, why are you going...again...wait a minute... THEM ? Spend a lot of time around corpses, do you?"  Mum : (Absently) I was a nurse, Michael. They said his mouth was open when he died and it stayed that way. Sheena says it's closed now. I wonder if they broke his jaw."  Me : (Look of pure fear...mouth partially open and emitting a low, keening wail.)  Yeah, my mum's gone fruitloop alright. I'm sort of hoping she'll return to normal after tomorrow. I'm sort of hoping everything will. It's going to be an EVIL time. I hate church, I hate funerals, I don't get on with most of my extended family, I have absolutely no desire to return to the place where I watched my father cremated, and my aunts are planning to end the service with the Mariah Carey song,  Hero . If they do this, I WILL start laughing. I won't be able to help myself.  Oh, and I actually got my hair cut today. Joy and rapture.  Possibility of political screeds in this location later on. Probability of amusing funeral stories and stoic recollections tomorrow.  You know you want it, you filthy bitches.

      Bit of a nothing day today. I finally crashed at around 8 o'clock this morning and then slept through until nearly 4pm, neatly killing my plans to go job hunting.  Having written off the productive part of my day, I figured I could at least get down to some serious internet time-wasting. To that end I've added a guestbook and a counter to the page using  urlLink Bravenet . It's all looking a bit cheap and cheesy, but it's the best I can do at the moment, especially given that I don't have ANY skills in the HTML department. I am picking things up, but it's a slow process.  So, yeah. Do me a favour and  urlLink SIGN  the damn guestbook. And go look at the counter. It's at the bottom of the page. Exciting, eh?  Indeed.  I received my copy of Bruce Campbell's autobiography from  urlLink Amazon  today. Of course, I immediately abandoned all other reading projects and dived in. Great so far. Campbell makes for a fanastic guide through his own life and career, and the various anecdotes and insider stuff will definitely give you plenty to chew on if you're a fan. Recommended so far, and I'll try to post a full review when I'm done.  The book was the second suspicious-looking package to arrive on my doorstep in as many days, although it wasn't quite as alarming as the huge box that the postman left outside yesterday, which definitely puzzled my parents, especially seeing as it was addressed to Word Boy.  This could only have been the work of the nefarious Juanita, who is one of only two people I know who would go to the trouble of posting cultural oddities halfway across the world. In this case, the item in question was an  ALF  doll, which I'll treasure forever. Cheers, Juan.  That'll do for now. I'll be back later, with...um...something. Until then, look for more strange and crap-looking gimcracks to appear on the site.  Yay!

        "In a sense," he said, "you're alone here. So if you jump, you'd best jump far."    A friend told me in an e-mail the other day that I "made insomnia sound like fun". Not quite my intention. It's interesting, and it  can  be fun. But mostly it's a nightmare. Especially if you have commitments.  So let me try and write insomnia for you again. This time, I'm going to go for the metaphorical approach.  Given how I've titled this blog, let's use The Darkened Room itself to represent my mind. It's just a little room, but it does a pretty good job of containing my life. All my wordly possessions are here, all the stuff I write is on the computer. My influences, heroes, and heroines can be found in the posters on the walls and in the CDs, DVDs, and books that line the shelves and litter the floor.  All good so far? Grand.   So, let's say that The Darkened Room is, in fact, my mind as I would like  others to see it . In Freudian terms, it's my ego.  Above The Darkened Room is an attic. A good few years ago a water pipe burst in this attic and, as a result, my ceiling is stained and misshapen. We've never gotten around to fixing it.  It isn't true, but let's pretend that I keep all my secret stuff in the attic. All my pornography and letters never sent. All the writing I've done that's come out so twisted and violent and wrong that I would never dare show it to anyone. All the stuff that's in the  really  dark part of my brain. The thoughts I regret having. The thoughts I never voice.  Ever had a bird trapped in your attic? Well, the bird in my attic is insomnia. It somehow found its way in there and it can't get out. It flies around in a panic, beating its body against the walls, tipping over all those nice neat piles of stuff in its frantic attempts to escape. And the battered ceiling of The Darkened Room is neither soundproof nor strong enough to resist such impacts.  At first, I'm aware of the bird thrashing around up there. I can hear it. I can't get up there and help it, the attic isn't safe. But I know it's there, like an itch I can't scratch. I can't relax with this knowledge. I can't sleep.  After a day or two, the bird is just going insane. The attic is chaos now. Below this maelstrom, I can look up and see the cracks starting to form in the ceiling. Maybe there's a little dust coming through, maybe a little liquid. Slowly but inevitably, like honey through a sieve.  I know I'll break down if it keeps up. The ceiling will give way and all those things I try to keep hidden away will crash down around me. The bird will be loose in the room I've tried so hard to keep neat and tidy and safe, and I'll be hunched beneath the covers, trembling with exhaustion and just praying for a sleep that never seems to come.  Yeah, insomnia can "sound like fun". In a funny way, having access to the sleep-deprived regions of thought can be an interesting and even mind-expanding experience. But like any drug, it's a thing best experienced in moderation. Of course, there's no choice with insomnia. You'll sleep when the bird finally decides to be still, and not a moment before.  I have chosen to live with my insomnia rather than treat it, for a couple of reasons. The first is that there is no reliable medical treatment for the condition. I refuse to take pills for my head. Despite its faults, I like it the way it is and have no wish to alter my condition chemically. The second is that I've already tried every available 'trick' to help me sleep, and none of them work for me.  My insomnia has become a part of who I am. I've suffered for eight or nine years now, and I've adjusted to it. I have my own methods of coping when it becomes a problem, and as I've said, there are some occasions when being a sufferer can actually help, especially when it comes to my creativity. Reaching a semi-dream state where the subconscious mind becomes much more obvious is an experience I'd recommend everybody try at least once.  Just don't make a habit of it, eh? Leave that to us professionals.

        "What have I become, my sweetest friend? Everyone I know goes away in the end."     This is a slightly bizarre little story. On some levels it works, on others it fails miserably. It's far too short, though. If I re-write it, it'll be a lot longer and I'll change the rather sudden ending. If you've come to this after reading the other one, the parallels I've drawn between the two should be obvious. In that sense, they belong together.   Fast-forward through the morning. Make a montage of it at the very least. The people don’t want to see the little details. Give them a trendy soundtrack and a rough idea of what I do before work. Yeah. Give them Nine Inch Nails.  Head Like A Hole . There’s a good, up-tempo rock song with lyrics that reflect the mood of yours truly as I prepare for the day ahead.  So it goes like this: Fade into me waking up. A room bathed in dawn’s half-light. An alarm going off.  Head Like A Hole  going through its opening sequences in the background. Just as the song hits the first of those staccato kick-drum impacts, I roll over and punch the clock. Kill the alarm, bring the song to the fore. Cut to…  I stare at myself in the mirror, my tired face bathed in harsh fluorescent light. I look pained. Cut to me splashing my face, brushing my teeth, getting dressed. Hurry this sequence, but don’t rush it. We’re introducing a main character here. Let it build with the music, maybe accelerating the speed of the cuts as Trent tiptoes up to the chorus.    No you can’t take it, no you can’t take it, no you can’t take that away from me…   Cut to…  A well-dressed young man striding purposefully down the high street, moving more quickly than those around him.   Head like a hole .  The camera moves like a stalker, ducking behind cars and weaving around the zombies as they stumble to work.   Black as your soul .  The young man crosses the road, unmindful of the traffic. Beneath the soundtrack, we hear the sound of horns, a screech of rubber on tarmac.   I’d rather die .  Now the camera actively follows the young man, like the opposite of that video The Verve did where Richard Ashcroft walked towards the screen. We can see his destination just ahead of us. It would be silhouetted if you could superimpose grey on grey. Instead it’s a monument to the ever-repeating monotony of suburban nowhere.   Than give you control .  The train station. The music fades out as we cut first to the young man standing at the ticket window, then to the platform, where he joins the massed ranks of commuters. All are in smart suits. All are carrying briefcases. All are looking to their right, where the camera picks out the train as perspective makes it swell until it almost fills the screen.  I’m a veteran of public transport. I’ve been riding this train for three years now. Twice a day, five days a week. I know most of the commuters, most of the tricks. When the train draws to a halt, I’m standing just to the left of the doors closest to the driver’s cabin. Two reasons for this. One, the front carriage is always quietest. Two, the station exit is to the right. When other passengers disembark, they invariably get involved in minor scuffles with those waiting on that side of the doors. While this is going on, I hop onto the train and claim the treasure of an aisle seat.  The window seat, traditionally, has greater value. This is a leftover from childhood. For some reason, people will always go for the window seats, even though most of them know this view like they know their own faces. The other pattern is that nobody sits next to anyone else unless they really have to. Some people would actually rather stand than sit next to another person. I think that’s really sad.  But I digress. The reason I like the aisle seat is because I’m tall. Once everybody’s on and we’re moving, I can put my long legs out into the aisle and not have to worry about sitting with my knees against my chest. I get cramp. Also, Scarlet always stands, and I might miss her if I sat in a window seat.  I slip my headphones over my ears and listen to the song I always listen to when I’m on the train. It’s called  Furryvision  and it’s by a Welsh band called the Super Furry Animals. It’s a funny little song, and I think it fits the scene perfectly. In the film of my life, I would make it the soundtrack to this scene, and I’d make the train completely silent. All you’d see would be what I see; people swaying back and forth, reading their papers or books, drinking their coffee. Hardly anybody talks, so it’s not like we’d be losing anything worth having.  I don’t know where Scarlet works, but I wouldn’t mind finding out. She always gets on my carriage. She’s beautiful in that older woman/secretary kind of way. In the film, there would have to be a tongue-in-cheek scene where she takes off her glasses and lets down her hair. Of course, if I wrote it, there would also have to be a scene where she takes off her clothes. Scarlet looks a bit like Angelina Jolie, I think. Only smaller. I’m not sure if she has any tattoos. I would ask, but I’m shy. In the film, she would be the one to approach me. I’d be really surprised and embarrassed and she would think I was sweet. Scarlet’s smart little skirts make the train journey bearable.  The reason I call her Scarlet is because she wears really red lipstick. It isn’t scarlet as such, but I thought that was a sexy name for her. Once, when my sister stayed over and rode the train with me, I pointed out Scarlet and said I fancied her. My sister laughed and said that Scarlet’s lipstick was the shade you’d expect to see smeared around the base of a cock. I spat my coffee out in my lap and everyone laughed. Scarlet looked at me and smiled. She didn’t hear what my sister said, but I blushed anyway.  The song that soundtracks me stalking Scarlet through King’s Cross would have to be  This Love  by Maroon 5. It would be sort of funny, because stalking someone is a bit unhealthy and nothing like love at all. Also, having a big hit song on the soundtrack would mean more publicity for the film. They could do a video for it and everything.  I’m not really a stalker. I just like watching her. When she goes left to the Victoria Line, I go right to the Northern Line to catch my next train. I’d leave me following her in the film, though. It makes me look a bit dark. I’m quirky and funny, but I want to be dark as well. Girls like that.  We’ve already done a train sequence, so we’ll just grab a quick shot of me looking bored on the Northern Line. Cut to…  The well-dressed young man breaks away from the West End crowds and turns into a side road. The difference is striking. Compared to the claustrophobic bustle of Oxford Street, this place is defined by an almost reverential silence. There are a lot of places like this in London, but they’re easy to miss. No music here. It would spoil the quiet. All we should hear is the city fading away and the young man’s footsteps echoing up between the buildings.  He approaches a door set back from the pavement. He punches a code into the panel beside it with practiced ease and slips inside. Cut to…  Work. This would probably be another montage, maybe with a pause now and again for some snappy dialogue between me and my boss. He’s got that archetypal boss thing about him; fat and loud and condescending, yet ultimately the mental inferior of the people that work for him.  Marcy Playground’s  Ancient Walls Of Flowers  plays over a montage of your hero typing away at his keyboard, talking on the phone, exchanging the occasional jibe with his workmates. We could occasionally cut away from this to show the fat, loud, condescending boss sitting in his office doing nothing. Maybe he’s smoking a cigar, drumming his fat fingers on the desk, clearly frustrated. Cut to…  Fat boss exits his office and hears me talking on the phone.  “…okay, mate. I’ll see you then. Yeah, no doubt. I’m looking forward to it. Bye.”  Fat boss frowns. “Was that a personal call?” he asks.  I’m very relaxed and casual. “No. It was a business call. Mark Riley. He’s a friend of mine,” I say.  “Oh, really,” Fat boss says, raising his voice so that the conversation now includes the whole office. Heads turn. “And what’s the rule we have about personal calls?”  “I thought I just explained quite clearly that it was a business call from an acquaintance. Mark’s handling one of our larger accounts, sir. Would you rather I be cold and impersonal with him?”  “No personal calls,” Fat boss says, but his voice is getting quieter now.  “No, sir. Next time I deal with Mark, I’ll let him know that you asked me not to be nice to him on the phone."  A long silence with the camera focussed squarely on Fat boss. In the background, my colleagues can be seen smirking.  “Have you compiled those reports I asked you for this morning?” He finally asks.  I smile and shove a fat sheaf of papers into his chubby, sweating fist. He stares at me a moment, then turns and storms back into his office. I take a moment to grin at my workmates. Cut to…  Early evening and the now-slightly-dishevelled young man leaves the office and heads back out onto Oxford Street. The atmosphere is heavier now. Clearly, this is a Friday night. After work drinking is just getting up to speed, and the younger crowd are just beginning to filter out from the tube stations in a steady stream. The young man smiles as he crosses the road, turning his head to watch a couple of teenaged girls in miniskirts and tight tops.  I love London at night. And this is an important one. I feel nervous but good. I’m going to do it tonight. I’m going to talk to her. I’m going to tell her how…  We hear the sound of rubber on tarmac again, only this time much louder. The car strikes the young man at speed, lifting him off his feet and throwing him up onto the bonnet. The camera follows the still-moving car as he rolls bonelessly up the windshield and across the roof, where he bounces once before being thrown clear to land in an untidy heap in the road. We hear the car finally screech to a halt off-camera. The girls the young man was watching are standing motionless on the pavement, frozen with shock. Already, a crowd of onlookers is beginning to form.  I’m numb all over. I had plans for music and camera shots and characters. I had plans for which actors were going to play which people. I found out where Scarlet goes after work. I wanted to sit and watch her from a darkened corner while  Sex And Candy  by Marcy Playground made the other customers nod their heads to the beat. Wait. Didn’t I already use Marcy Playground? Isn’t there a rule about that? Why are all these people staring at me? Sirens in the distance. An ambulance weaving through the traffic. Siren-cam, like in Police Squad. My spine’s on fire and my legs are full of lead. Could use that Super Furries song again here. Ridiculous to be lying in the middle of Oxford Street while people oh-my-god and look-at-him. I feel weightless. Can’t keep my eyes open. Can’t think of a new song for Scarlet. Can’t think of a new song. Can’t think of a song. Don’t look at me. Cut to…

        "Through every forest, above the trees, within my stomach, scraped off my knees, I drink the honey inside your hive. You are the reason I stay alive"     I've had a busier day than expected, but I did manage to find the time to hammer out these two stories. This is the 'erotic' short, but I'm not sure you could really classify it as such. It does have an erotic element, but it's predominantly a straight story of a brief encounter. This is my favourite of the two, if only because the characters have more depth to them and I haven't tried to go anywhere clever with it. That's usually my undoing. Keep in mind that both of these stories are first drafts. I've edited for spelling and sense, but that's all.   I happened to be looking at the dark-haired girl when she got hit, and I knew it had to have hurt. She was beside me in the crowd waiting to pick up coats and bags from the cloakroom, the pair of us shuffling slowly forward, sweating in the oppressive atmosphere. Large numbers of people in enclosed spaces have never been my thing, and I was distracting myself from claustrophobia by watching the girl. She was about a head shorter than me, slim and pale and fragile in a tight-fitting black T-shirt with an Atari Teenage Riot logo on the front, skate pants hanging loosely on her hips. It was just as I was leaning forward to get a better look at her face that the can came flying out of the shadows behind us.  I don’t think anybody else saw it, though it was quickly obvious that something had happened. A male voice shouted “Fucking hurry up,” and then a crushed beer can coloured Heineken green connected with the girl’s skull. She made no sound, but immediately bent forward, her hand coming up to clutch at a place somewhere just behind her ear. I put a hand on her shoulder, to reassure or comfort or something, and turned to see the wanker who’d thrown it glaring at me. He was about my height, clad all in denim, sporting a haircut and shades that were pure Liam Gallagher circa 1997.  “Watch what you’re fucking doing,” I said. I didn’t shout. I didn’t need to. The area around the cloakroom was suddenly very quiet.  He smiled and then threw something else, a coin maybe. I heard it hit the wall behind me.  “Make me, cunt,” he said.  And I was going to, I really was. I’m not usually one for fighting, but sometimes you meet people who really do deserve to get their heads kicked in. For the good of us all, I mean.  “Don’t. It’s not worth it.” The girl standing upright, showing she was okay.  “Sorry, love. Wasn’t aiming at you. Your boyfriend’s a wanker, though,” Liam said, and actually earned a few laughs.  “You’re the one on your own, mate,” she fired back, and gave him a wonderfully slow and elaborate hand gesture to indicate what she believed he did on his own. The crowd reacted with yet more laughter, this time trailing away into the murmur of conversation.  The girl and I realised simultaneously that we were at the front of the queue, and we turned with tickets in hand to reclaim our coats.  “Thanks,” she said, and offered a shy smile that was somewhat at odds with her previous hand movement.  “Anytime. Didn’t look like you needed my help, though.”  The smile broadened. “Thanks all the same,” she said.  “Yeah,” I said, offering a grin of my own. “For thirty seconds or so, I was your boyfriend.”  On which throwaway remark we were ushered towards the stairs by bouncers that had been conveniently absent for the can-throwing festivities. I glanced back and saw that Liam was close behind. It was hard to tell if he was looking at me, but his body language was threatening and the smile was gone.  “Shit,” I murmured, but there was no-one to hear. The girl had gone on ahead.  I hit the pavement and started walking quickly, hoping to distance myself from what was surely going to be a confrontation. No such luck. I heard his footsteps running up behind me and braced myself just before he shoved me in the back. It was enough to keep me from falling, but when I turned, he shoved his chest hard against mine, lager-breath washing over my face.  “Think you’re fucking funny, do ya? Think you’re a comedian? Where’s your bird now? Left you, did she? It’s ‘cause you’re a fucking wanker, mate.”  I got my hands between us and shoved him away, dimly aware of my temper rising. My heart was beating fast and my stomach felt shrunken and empty. I was shaking.  “Leave it,” I said. “I’m not interested.”  Liam stepped forward and shoved me again. This time I stepped back off the kerb and almost fell again, half-turning and placing one hand awkwardly on the tarmac to halt my stumble. I immediately threw myself at him harder, sending him into a passing group of lads who pinballed him right back at me. We collided, and he bounced awkwardly off me and fell to the ground. I took a couple of steps backward to compensate for the impact, then…  Then something hit me so hard that I lost all sense of reality. Suddenly I was in uncontrollable motion, lights kaleidoscoping around me as my body made repeated contact with some unforgiving surface. My back, my ribs, my arms, my legs. Then a moment of pure silence before I crashed to the ground, the back of my head bouncing so violently off the road that the world turned briefly grey. Nauseating colours danced across my vision.  “Oh my God!”  “You fucking idiot!”  “Is he okay?”  Stunned, winded, numb. Strange faces looking down at me. This odd perspective making the nausea worse, making me want to throw up.  “I didn’t see him. What was he doing in the road, anyway? Fucking idiot.”  “Shut up. Can’t you see he’s hurt? Somebody call a fucking ambulance.”  “I’m alright,” I managed. Then a little louder, “I’m okay.”  “Are you sure?” A girl’s voice. The girl’s voice.  “No.”  I pushed myself up into a sitting position. Hands grabbed me beneath the armpits and by the collar of my coat, helping me to my feet. The world span crazily and then focussed on the face of a middle-aged man.  “Fucking idiot,” he said, with the air of a man who knows one when he sees one.  I punched him as hard as I could, my fist making a perfect contact with the centre of that smug face, splitting skin and crunching against bone. He dropped immediately, and in the silence that followed, I could hear him moaning.  “Top banana,” someone said, in an awe-struck stage-whisper.  More laughter.  “Come on.” The girl’s voice again.  I let my arm be taken, let myself be led back to the pavement and away up the street. I could hear sirens in the distance.  “Nice work, slugger,” she said.  “What happened? Where are we going?”  “You got into a fight. Then you got hit by a car. Then you decked a cab driver.”  “Shit.”  “You’re doing pretty well so far.”  “I couldn’t even tell you my name right now.”  “Are you sure you don’t want to go to hospital?”  “No. I’m okay. I just need a few minutes.”  “I live just around the corner. You can get a glass of water or whatever.”  And somehow, despite all that had just had just happened, something in me smiled.  I’ve no idea where she took me. I was too busy trying to will the numbness in my body to hold on just a little bit longer. I could feel it fading, giving way before the crowd of individual agonies my body had become. By the time she was helping me up a flight of stairs in a block of flats somewhere, I was breathless and sweating. Every sudden movement brought a stab of pain from somewhere, and every time I gasped she would pause and I could feel her looking at me. Finally, she pushed me back against a wall and I heard the jangle of keys.  “You’re a mess. I’m gonna call an ambulance,” she said. “Come on.”  She led me into her flat. Hunched over as I was, all I saw of it was a stained and rather threadbare carpet. Through another doorway, and she let me fall into the cool softness of a bed.  “I’ll be back,” she said.  “Don’t call an ambulance.”  “Look at yourself.”  “Nothing’s broken,” I said, though I wasn’t entirely sure.  “Yeah, and where would you be now if I hadn’t come along?”  “I wouldn’t have been in this situation if you hadn’t come along.”  I managed to wriggle onto my back just as she sighed and sat down on the edge of the bed. Her face was nothing like I’d expected. The first thing that hit you were the eyes. They were blue and almost comically large, like a character from one of those Japanese cartoons, and they flanked a slightly too-long nose that was forgiven by a wide and full-lipped mouth. She was pretty, but not remarkably so.  “And what the fuck are you staring at?” she said, smiling.  “I was trying to get a look at your face when that prick threw the can,” I said. “It took me this long.”  “Two fights and a car accident. I didn’t think I was that nice looking.”  “You’re not,” I said, and she laughed.  “You’re no oil painting yourself. Especially not now. Where does it hurt?”  “Everywhere.”  “The most.”  “My ribs. And my fist. Where I hit that guy. He was the one who hit me?”  “Yeah.”  “That’s a relief. What happened to Liam?”  “Liam?”  “The wanker.”  “I didn’t see. I think he legged it. Show me.”  She scooted up the bed and pointed to my T-shirt, which was damp with sweat and maybe blood. Too tired and weak to take it off, I pulled it up as far as I could.  “No bruising yet. You look okay.”  “You have first aid training?”  “No. I just don’t get many guys up in my room. What’s your name, by the way?”  “Trent.”  “As in Reznor?”  “As in Stoke-On. I was conceived on a boat.”  “Oh, the romance.”  “How about you?”  “I don’t know where I was conceived, and I don’t want to know.”  “Your name, I meant.”  “Scarlet.”  “That’s…unusual.”  “Nickname. I used to dye my hair red. The name stuck. I like it.”  “I like it.”  “Then all is well. Tell you what, I’ll go and get you a couple of Nurofen and then maybe you should try and get some sleep or something. If you still can’t move in the morning, I’ll drive you to a hospital.”  “I’m okay.”  “So you keep saying.”  Scarlet left the room and came back a couple of minutes later with a glass of water and a pack of Nurofen. Aware that the level of feeling in my body still hadn’t fully returned and that further pain was a possibility, I took four.  “An overdose? You’re really going for it, Trent.”  “Yeah…”  Scarlet held my eyes for a few moments, then took the glass from my hand.  “Get some sleep,” she said.  “Yes, ma’am.”  I managed to wriggle out of my coat and my T-shirt, but further undressing seemed too difficult a proposition. I was as comfortable as I was going to get on my back, so I stayed where I was and closed my eyes.  I don’t know how long I slept for. Maybe an hour, maybe two. I woke up in darkness, and it had already been early morning when I’d left the club. The painkillers were still working, though. I could tell that much. Apart from the stiffness, swinging my legs off the bed and sitting up was a relatively easy task. Still, I was careful. I kept my hands on the bed and let my legs take my weight a little at a time. I was still trembling, but the pain had receded.  I wasn’t creeping. It was dark and quiet and I was in a stranger’s home. It seemed only natural to walk slowly and carefully to the door, then to pull it gently open. If Scarlet was sleeping in the next room, I didn’t want to wake her.  The next room was the living room, and Scarlet wasn’t sleeping. She was lying on the couch, her naked skin painted in shades of light. The curtains were as threadbare as the carpet, and both the moon and the streetlights shone easily through the frayed material. Her breathing was steep and ragged, loud in the stillness and silence of the room. I could see the way her body was tensed, the way her arm was resting on her belly. All else was speculation, but it was clear what she was doing.  The feeling was not dissimilar to the way I felt when I was sure Liam and I were going to fight. The same empty fear, the same sudden and stark choice. Stay or leave.  Scarlet whispered a moan, light and airy and beautiful. She shifted position slightly and that queer mixture of light briefly touched the hand that moved between her thighs.  I swallowed and concentrated on silencing my own breathing. I could see her eyes were closed. I took a few steps towards her, mindful of the light and positioning myself outside of its influence. Even if she had opened her eyes, she probably wouldn’t have seen me.  What I thought before, about Scarlet being unremarkable, seemed ludicrous now. Caught in intimacy like this, breathing and sweating and taking pleasure in her own body, unclothed without shame or insecurity in this patchwork of light and shadow, she was beautiful.  My own arousal seemed to increase in concert with hers. As her hushed sighs became more frequent and desperate, as her body tensed and relaxed ever more rapidly, as the pale skin at her hairline and between her breasts began to glisten with sweat, I felt myself slip into a state I’d never reached without physical contact. In the back of my mind, I recalled a magazine article I’d once read about a man who could will himself to climax. At that moment, it didn’t seem like such a far-fetched idea.  All at once Scarlet’s body seemed to seize up. She caught her breath and held it. Her free hand clutched at the sofa beneath her while one foot pushed repeatedly forward, as though seeking purchase. Then her head went back and she sighed, all of her strength seemingly exhaled with that one breath so that she lay boneless and spent, her chest heaving as her lungs struggled to catch that lost oxygen.  Then she said, “Feeling better?”  I froze.  “Are you feeling better?” she repeated, enunciating each syllable as though she was speaking to a five year old.  “Y-yes. Better. Yes.”  “Anything you wanted?”  I swallowed. “No. I was just…I woke up. I was confused. Wondered where you were. I’m gonna…get back to bed now.”  “Want to go to hospital in the morning?”  “No. No, I don’t. Really, I’m okay.”  “Want to take me out for breakfast?”  “What? Yeah. Why not?”  “Okay then. I’ll see you in the morning.”  “Absolutely.”  I turned and shuffled back towards the bedroom, my mind reeling.  “Scarlet?” I said, pausing in the doorway.  “Uh-huh?”  “It was… It was worth it.”  She laughed, soft and delicate like her sighs. “Tomorrow,” she said. “When everything’s not going at a million miles an hour.”  “Tomorrow,” I said, and closed the door.

        "I swear I just found everything I need. The sweat in your eyes, the blood in your veins are listening to me. Well, I want to wrap it up and swim in it until I drown. My moral standing is lying down. Nothing quite like the feel of something new."    So  urlLink Clean Sheets  have just accepted another of my erotic shorts. I'm both pleased and a little cautious. On the positive side, they get something like 2000 hits a day over there, and that's plenty of exposure for my work. On the negative...well...I don't mind writing erotica, but I've always seen it as a fun distraction and an excellent chance to stretch my prose legs. I don't want people to see it as my field.   I don't know. Sometimes I look at the erotic works that are out there and worry that it's basically glorified porn with very little merit. But on the other hand,  Fitz And Me , the story they're featuring next month, is a decent little piece of work. Or at least it was in its original form. I do have a little concern about the 900 words they killed before agreeing to display it. That's a hell of a chunk from a 4500 word short. But then, when they feature  Rain  in September, they're going to put it up uncut. It's a good deal shorter, and driven by prose rather than character. So I can't complain about them fucking with that one, so to speak.  The bottom line? They're just using me for sex. So shallow. What about my feelings, eh? I WANT A BABY, DAMN YOU!  Wait...that wasn't what I wanted to say at all. Where was I? Oh...yeah.  I want to set myself a challenge and also get some more fictional content up on here, so I'm going to tempt you all with the promise of not one, but TWO BLOG EXCLUSIVES tomorrow. That's TWO BLOG EXCLUSIVES! I'll write an erotic short to warm up, and then try to nail a decent short story, a goal I haven't been able to achieve in months. Then I'll post them both.  If I'm not too ashamed of the results, that is.

        "I watched with glee while your kings and queens fought for ten decades for the gods they made."    I couldn't face the world today. This lack of rest is making a coward of me. My dreams are so fragmented and so brief, haunting my brief forays into unconsciousness like so many unfinished tales. These broken days are a sensory overload for me sometimes. Like watching the first half of a film, then the last half of three others, then the next quarter of the first. And so on. Over and over.  I dreamed a girl I do not know last night. I dreamed her in fragments, starred and then shattered like glass. When consciousness defeated me again, I knew her name. Still, I shivered, outraged. Who is my dream-self to put faces to names like that? Such predictions can only ever be precursors to disappointment. Yet my sleep-phantom, in all his capering glory, smiles and dances at this knowledge, taunting me from places forever beyond my reach.  I dreamed her mouth on mine, her taste and her scent. I clothed her in fantasy and undressed her in same. She smiled, she spoke, she laughed. She came to me theatrically, as though she'd planned it forever.  In a room filled with smoke and music and conversation. Everything is background, nothing clarity. Rhythmic bass and cliched chatter. She's telling me something, and I take her meaning from the expression on her face and the way her hands draw pictures in the air. In a moment of respite, I glance around and notice that I've slept with everyone in the room, and that they're all smoking. She reclaims my attention and her clothes and hair have changed. I touch her face and she grins and then kisses my hand, her eyes telling my fortune in a promise.  I woke, briefly, warm and uncomfortable. My head was swollen and pulsing. The walls looked nicotine yellow in the almost-light of a grey afternoon expressing its frustration through curtains untidily drawn. I closed my eyes, hid behind maroon walls. Fade from grey. Fade to black.  Earlier, or later, or another time, we walk through the cold, dark streets of Soho. She looks paler, slimmer. There are dark circles beneath her eyes that might be make-up or a reflection of my own sleeplessness. She's unhappy, and she clutches my arm tightly with one hand while pointing out people she knows with the other. They are all film stars.  For a moment, I'm sitting in front of the computer typing. She walks into the room clad only in black stockings. She speaks the words of an old song without moving her lips. She straddles me. Her voice in my ear says, "Just as every cop is a criminal, and all the sinners saints. As heads is tails, just call me lucifer, ’cause I’m in need of some restraint."  I woke up with her name on my tongue, with a tumour in my head and needles in my spine and a smile on my face. I woke up, but I'll sleep again.

        "I’ve given everything I need. I’d give you everything I own. I’d give in if it could at least be ours alone. I’ve given everything I could, to blow it to hell and gone, burrow down in and blow up the outside world."    I'm trying to wrap a tired mind around thoughts and theories relating to culture and the internet and the idea of evolution, and I'm not sure I've reached a place where I can make sense of it. So if this turns out to be an incoherent ramble, then I apologise in advance.  In the course of a little research I was doing for  urlLink The Politics Of Weakness , I stumbled across an article damning the internet as one of many causes for our current evolutionary (in terms of culture) slump. A multitude of voices, this article stated (and I've lost the link, so you'll have to take my word for it), meant that each of those voices had less value. The article piqued my interest, but I forgot all about it because it wasn't relevant to the essay I was writing at the time.  Check out  urlLink Dan's post  on the subject of blogging. It's plunging the same vein in many respects, and I've been forced into thinking about it by both agreeing and disagreeing with the points he makes.  I'm not going to talk about blogging, though. I'd like to broaden the scope a little.  When I first came across the term  globalisation , it was in the context of multi-national corporations and their attempts to break down the cultural barriers between vastly different societies. This was largely about achieving a kind of global marketing synergy, and it's fair to say that as far as tangible examples of globalisation go, you can't find too many images more recognisable than, say, the golden arches. In fact, I doubt you can find a civilised culture in the world that doesn't have a universal understanding of what that means.  But what about interpretation? After all, one person's Happy Meal is another person's food of Satan, right? That conflicting opinion is another global phenomena that's almost as familiar nowadays as the arches themselves. Would that be the case if it wasn't for the internet?  Globalisation is seen as an evil by many, from those with patriotic beliefs to those who see it merely as a tool for corporations and monied interests to exploit ever-larger audiences. It's a sort of all-purpose evil, the ultimate folk-devil for our times. No matter your views or beliefs or politics, you can probably find at least one reason why globalisation is wrong. At least part of this is a matter of definition. Globalisation as the breaking down of cultural and political barriers so that human beings, as a race, can come to new understandings and rid ourselves of the petty squabbles and misunderstandings that characterise a divided world? Cool. As a way for multi-nationals to break down cultural barriers by presenting us with a series of symbols (the arches, the swoosh, the shell) that mean the same thing in any language? Not today, thank you kindly.  Corporate globalisation is a reality that we're not going to escape from. But the protests against it have become a symptom of the cause, an irony that seems to have been lost somewhere amidst the fighting. The internet is the current nadir of global communication. Without it, the anti-capitalist movement would have little save for the fading star of Michael Moore. Global communication is a necessity in a global fight...for both sides. Ultimately, what we've done is to give globalisation several new definitions and a new battle ground.   The internet is far more democratic than the real world. You can find, in this medium, examples of every conceivable faith, belief, opinion, and taste. And the internet is  still  something of a free-for-all. It's still something like anarchy when compared to the structured and bureaucratic norms of our society. Yes, voices have been censored by hands both corporate and governmental. But hasn't there always been a backlash? And isn't it fair to say that for every website that supports the status quo, there is one that demands it be torn down? Isn't it true that for every product that has some kind of controlling or privacy-invading element, there is a hacker or a coder out there who has taken it apart and created either a 'safe' version or an alternative?  Yes, the internet is oversaturated. Yes, there is so much information that it's difficult for individual voices to stand out. But those voices are  there . Maybe you haven't checked the real world recently, but out there, it seems like you're either a George Bush person, or a Michael Moore person. Those are our cultural behemoths, doing battle, in one way or another, for  everybody .  The real world has evolved to a point where a global society can essentially be divided into two distinct camps, both of which are extremely self-centered and have little time for dissenters or stragglers. The internet has evolved into the anarchy of a million voices spouting a million opinions you can choose to either hear or dismiss.  I know where I'd rather be.

        "I know I believe in nothing, but it is my nothing."    Another week of hypocrisy and soft-target 'scandals' in the British media has left me believing in little save for the validity of my own cynicism.  It all started last Thursday, the day that the BBC were due to screen Jason Gwynne's documentary,  The Secret Agent .  The Sun  newspaper, having already been shown the documentary, ran a front page story featuring the headline 'Bloody Nasty People'. Or BNP. See what they did there? Highbrow. The newspaper then went on to dedicate several pages to condemning the BNP as racist thugs.  Right. Because  The Sun  (Britain's biggest selling daily newspaper) is clearly a haven of open-mindedness and joy. The hypocrisy is astounding. Over the years,  The Sun  has damaged race relations in Britain beyond the wildest dreams of the BNP. Sensationalist headlines screaming about evil asylum seekers taking OUR jobs and OUR benefits appear almost daily, and the rantings of columnists like Richard Littlejohn - whose recent novel  To Hell In A Handcart  was described as a "400 page recruiting pamphlet for the BNP" - don't help the matter any.  Incidentally, you can find a highly amusing exchange between Littlejohn and Will Self  urlLink here .   The Sun  makes its money through demonising foreigners and perpetuating the kind of stereotypes that drive people into the waiting arms of parties like the BNP and make pathetic, narrow-minded notions of 'Little England' such a staple of our culture. It's the equivalent of Angler's Monthly telling us that fishermen are the servants of Satan.  As for the BBC and Jason Gwynne, well, just what exactly is controversial about proving to us that the BNP is full of racists, bigots, and morons? As Tom Utley pointed out in  The Daily Telegraph  the following day, Gwynne's next documentary may as well expose strong evidence of Roman Catholicism in the Vatican.  All that the BBC have done, in this instance, is help to publicise the BNP and make them once again the centre of attention. People  do  vote for these parties, but never in large enough numbers to win them seats. If left alone or confronted in reasoned debate rather than sensationalised, the BNP would be exposed for the shambling anachronism it clearly is.  Maybe, just maybe, the BBC should screen a documentary about the insidious racial propaganda of the tabloids and the effect it has on our culture as a whole. Maybe it should take a slightly bolder approach to journalism and expose us to a few home truths, rather than creating new folk devils while Britain's real problems go unchecked. Maybe - and this is a  really  controversial one - someone should point out that nobody would be able to take advantage of our asylum policy if it wasn't so fucking stupid and outdated in the first place.   The problem is related to neither race nor nationality. It's related to policy. And last time I checked, the people that made those policies were British. Most of them were also white. Just like the 'journalists' that peddle this crap.  As Richard Littlejohn likes to say, you couldn't make it up.  Related articles:  urlLink Blowing Up The BNP ,  urlLink Going Undercover In The BNP ,  urlLink Tom Utley in  The Daily Telegraph  . Also, you can find differing viewpoints on the websites of both  The Sun  and the BNP. As twisted as my little black heart is, I refuse to link them from this page.

      " It's World War I and then the Bolshevik Revolution as the surgeon Zhivago is torn between fidelity and passion. Shaken by the war he struggles to retain his life, his individualism and his freedom. Boris Pasternak was a beloved Russian poet when he wrote Doctor Zhivago in 1955. Based partly on his own experiences, the novel was rejected by Soviet authorities. Defying the government, he allowed the book to be published abroad, where it became an international bestseller. In 1958 Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. The romance, the passion, and the inspiration for this rich, satisfying tea.  The citrus character of the tea is enhanced with the spicy notes of cinnamon, resulting in a fragrant, rich brew. Refreshingly different. Perfect for your morning cup.  Dr. Zhivago is best when brewed with spring water at a temperature of 212° for 4 to 5 minutes. Use one rounded teaspoon for every 8 ounces. Enjoy this tea through 2 infusions ."  I've just spent the last fifteen minutes or so struggling to stay in my seat as I surfed the (completely unintentional) goldmine of comedy that is  urlLink this site , where tea - according to the introduction - is 'a beverage, a philosophy, an experience, and an art form'. Those words, incidentally, were penned by somebody named Maureen.  Bless.

        "It's getting hard to tell where what I am ends and what they're making me begins."    So I abandoned Internet Explorer forever in the early hours of this morning. On the advice of various friends more technically-minded than I, I took a monumental step into the unknown and turned my back on Microsoft FOREVER.  Okay, maybe not FOREVER. There is still the small question of my hotmail account and memberships of various MSN communities. But it's a start, right?  Of course,  urlLink Firefox  isn't a finished product as yet, and the recommendations came from friends who invariably knew how to deal with any problems a product still very much in its infancy could throw at them. I do not, and today has been something of a learning experience.  Most of this month has been the same way. I've been attempting to navigate my way through the basics of HTML while simultaneously learning all about spyware and adware and pop-ups and all the other nasty little surprises the internet can throw up, surprises I've been largely ignorant of until recently. For someone that struggles with logic problems and will always think around something before trying the direct route, this isn't proving to be an easy or particularly enjoyable education. But I'm getting there. Tonight, for example, I was able to write a reasonbly fluent e-mail on the subject of the  urlLink W3C  coding standards to one of the webmasters at  urlLink EC , explaining that  urlLink Firefox  struggles to read certain sections of their site because they've been coded with Internet Explorer in mind and pointing out that - while IE is the most popular browser in the world right now, it might not be a couple of years down the road, especially if Mozilla's community-based approach to web browsing keeps gaining followers at the current rate.  Anyway, having dowloaded  urlLink Firefox  and seen its awesomeness for myself, I intend to help spread the word. Ditch IE, it sucks.   urlLink Firefox  blocks any and all pop-ups you ask it to. For those still stuck with a computer infested with spyware, I highly recommended downloading  urlLink Spybot  and  urlLink AdAware . Do NOT pay for any spyware removal tools. These two have everything you need, and they are the ONLY tools that are not suspect.  If you have any further questions or problems regarding spyware, try asking  urlLink these dudes . They're very helpful, and know their stuff.  As far as I'm aware, if you browse with  urlLink Firefox  and protect with  urlLink Spybot  and  urlLink AdAware , you (the casual browser) should be relatively safe from evil.   If anybody more knowledgable than I wants to add to this post, the comments box is where it always is.

        "I guess I should be one to talk, there's nights that I can't even walk. There's days I couldn't give a fuck, and in between is where I'm stuck"           My first experience of 'online romance' came at the hands of a girl who jumped all over me before I'd even noticed her. I'm not going to mention any real names, but she adopted the username of PoetryLady, sort of a tribute to my HappyHarry moniker. I was really flattered by the attention, and I found her easy to talk to. In fact, we got along famously. I never saw any future in it, though, and I certainly never saw it in the same light as I saw real life flirting. It was a game to me. It was fun.     PoetryLady didn't see things the same way. We'd swapped pictures and - in keeping with my honesty policy as regards the blog - I didn't find her at all physically appealing. Realising that there was at least a possibility that she was taking the whole thing a lot more seriously than I was, I began to distance myself, an action that only served to fuel her pursuit of me. Finally, after weeks of stilted chatting and an atmosphere that was affecting the entire room, I told PoetryLady the whole truth about how I saw our 'relationship'. She told me that I was making her cry. I felt like a manipulative bastard, despite the fact I was also sure I'd been nothing but honest.     And there, I think, is everything that's stupid and pointless and wrong with people that take internet relationships seriously. Yes, it's a great way to meet new people, but until you know them in real life, it's just a fantasy.     Steffi and Alun, two friends I did make over the internet, came to stay with me not long after that. The little clique that dominated the Rainbow Room had fallen apart, but Steffi had come over from Germany and I was still in touch with Alun via Messenger. The three of us went bowling and then spent an evening at my house, where we shot the breeze for a while and found that our real-life conversations were nowhere near as much fun as those we'd shared over the internet. I still exchange e-mails with Alun about once a year, just to see how he's doing. I have no idea where Steffi is.     After the weirdness with PoetryLady, I stayed away from the internet for a while, worried that my experience would repeat itself. Boredom drew me back in after a couple of months, though, this time to the brave new world of MSN chat.     I was a newbie again, but I was a little more prepared this time. I knew what all the little acronyms meant, and my constant writing practice was improving my typing all the time. Under my new username, NeonExile, I found I was able to stand out from the crowd again. In a matter of days, I'd relapsed.     After surfing various rooms for a period of several weeks, I settled into a chat called Movies. I was working in a cinema, and I loved film, so it seemed like a logical place to go. I made new online friends, and pretty soon I was a fixture.     It was through that initial foray into MSN chat that I met Ray, Ana, and Jammie. Ray is  urlLink linked  from this very page, Ana makes up one quarter of J.A.R.T., the evil masterminds behind  urlLink Softcore Sewing Circle: Season One , and Jammie can be found commenting on these very pages. These relationships, as you can see, have been far more enduring. In fact, the first time I chatted to Ray was over three years ago. We've only met twice, but on the first of those occasions, I had to be dragged semi-conscious from a pub. On the second, I had to half-carry Ray to a waiting cab. We've stayed apart for our own continuing health.     Ray met Ana at the same time and in the same place I did. Now she lives over here and they're married. On particularly dark nights, I  still  get jealous of that jammy bastard.     Jammie came over from Oklahoma to England in the summer of last year. I helped in her planning and even went on a brief tour of London hostelries to find her a place to stay. When she finally got here, it was me that met her off the plane. The following two weeks ruled, and plans are already being formed for many more kinds of Anglo-American cultural interplay.     But before all that, and as a counter-argument against the PoetryLady experience, I fell in love.     You see, me and Beckie never  meant  to get into any kind of relationship. It just happened. She was in Liverpool and I was in London. A mutual (online) friend had enlisted the pair of us to help him with a short film he was making. In the weeks preceding her visit, we started chatting a lot more than we had before (we were both regular visitors to the Movies room) and suddenly discovered that we had chemistry to spare. Of course, neither of us mentioned this, but it was obvious enough.     When we finally met in a dingy Ealing pub, we were sat together for maybe half an hour before we were all over each other, much to the consternation of our drinking companions. We shot the film, I took Beckie out the next night, and we agreed to meet up for further adventures.     Those further adventures turned into a two-year relationship. And while I'm no longer with Beckie, that's the longest and most satisfying relationship I've ever had.     And those, I think, are examples of why the internet is so fantastic. So long as you don't get hung up on people you haven't actually met, so long as you understand that the internet is all about masks and barriers and secrets, you really can meet new people. You really can develop fascinating and enduring friendships.     Yes, I have had further bad experiences with the internet over the years. In fact, the bad probably outweigh the good. But that's the drawback of the medium. It's easy for people to lie, even if they're not lying maliciously. You can't see facial expressions and you can't read body language. And somehow, when people you're starting to trust or at least like online start going behind your back or lying to you, it's worse then real-life. I think in real-life, some part of us at least has an idea when somebody isn't telling the truth, especially if we know that person.     The other thing is that there are a lot of desperate and unhappy people out there. You don't meet them down the pub because they don't  go  down the pub. But on the internet, you can be anybody you choose and go pretty much wherever you like. That's why the internet has the reputation it has and why you come across so many freaks and dickheads and people that are so obviously deeply lonely and miserable that it makes me want to cry.     It's a world, this internet thing, but it's not  the  world. For that, you need to look outside your window instead of logging on to Windows. But if you take it as it comes, with all the freaks, weirdos, arseholes, fakers, and arrogant pricks...not to mention the viruses, spyware, pop-ups, redirects, and javascripts...well, you'll probably meet at least a couple of people you'll be proud to call your friends.     I don't worry about it anymore. I've been here a while, and I know what I'm doing. I communicate with all the people I possibly can and then see what happens. If it all goes wrong, well, the block button was invented for a reason, right?     Happy surfing, kids, and if you happen to bump into a NeonExile at some point in your travels, say hi. I'm not a weirdo.     Honest.

        "I never meant to cause you pain. I never thought I'd be the one who took the fall. I got lost in the moment."           I have an addictive personality. As a child, I was hooked on milk for years. Yes, milk. I'd drink four-pint bottles at a time. Which is probably why I've never broken any significant bones and have such beautiful teeth. I grew up on a diet that was 90% calcium.     I took up smoking at the age of fourteen. I was a three-a-day man for about four years, but when I got to university, that suddenly shot up to twenty-a-day. It's stayed there ever since, apart from the occasional, half-arsed attempt to quit.     I had my first alcoholic drink at around about the same time I had my first cigarette. I didn't really enjoy drinking, though. As a teenager, I'd hang around on street corners with my friends and drink Diamond White or cheap Belgian lager from Tesco, but I never did it when I was by myself. To be honest, it was always a peer pressure thing.     My first real experience of drinking was at university. I described it briefly in the post that precedes this one. I went off the rails in quite spectacular fashion for several months. It wasn't that big a deal, though. I recovered from the wobble, and life went on.     Two things happened to change this. First, I became friendly with a guy called Chris. We worked together at Borehamwood cinema, and quickly discovered a shared love of the  Evil Dead  films and loud guitars. We started hanging out, going to see films and hitting the pub...all the usual things friends do. Then, one night when we'd only just begun to enjoy our drinking, it was suddenly eleven o'clock. We found ourselves back out on the streets with nothing to do and nowhere to go. It  was  pay-day, though, and we both had money in our wallets. Enough for a jaunt into London? Indeed.     Chris and I had such a good time that we vowed to have a proper night out every Friday, whether others came with us or not. After a while, this became every Friday  and  Saturday. Then every weekend and occasionally on weeknights.     At the start, we weren't drinking all that much. But the more often we went out, the harder it became to get drunk. The amount we spent on booze increased dramatically, and our nights out became the stuff of myth and legend amongst our friends and co-workers. They accompanied us less and less often as our trips into the city slipped further into the realm of the insane. I would wake up aching and ill, unable to clearly recall what I'd done the night before. I lost count of the times I regained consciousness to find myself in some unexpected location. Park benches, bus stops, benches, strange beds. Over a period of eighteen months or so, I did them all regularly.     The second thing that happened was that I took a management position at The Coronet cinema in Notting Hill Gate. My monthly pay doubled and I found myself out on the town almost every night, rarely taking the time to think about what I was doing or why.     I worked at The Coronet for almost two years. During that time I was hospitalised on three separate occasions, once for splitting my head open whilst attempting to jump off a table at the LA2, and twice for drinking myself into unconsciousness. My third and final visit to the casualty department of University College Hospital came about when I drank so much absinthe I nearly died.     I took care after that. I knew my limits, and I stayed well within them. Nonetheless, I was still drinking heavily on a regular basis until I left the cinema and had to cut back for financial reasons. It helped that I was in a long-term relationship at that point. While my girlfriend was no stranger to the depravities of excessive drinking, she didn't have the problems staying away that I did. Her influence was good for me and - with a couple of exceptions - I stayed relatively straight for a couple of years.     I took the eventual break-up well, I think, and there was certainly no repeat of my previous behaviour. I still drank, but always in moderation.     Such a relative term, that one. Moderation. Without the financial burden of a full-time relationship over a considerable distance, I began to retreat into myself as I always do when there is nothing of note going on in my life. Chris had found his own long-term relationship, and it took him out of my life and away up north, where he and his partner bought a house together. I continued to struggle with my first novel and took a part-time bar job. I'd work three or four nights a week and wrestle with words the rest of the time, usually accompanied by a bottle of supermarket-brand bourbon. Looking back, I'd guess I was getting through maybe four of these in a week.     That trend continued when I moved away from home. I was living above a pub, and it was all too easy to get hold of alcohol. This wasn't helped by the fact that one of my managers was clearly afflicted by the same disease.     It's now almost a year since the end of that last relationship. I moved back home just over three weeks ago and immediately settled into the familiar routine. I wrote, I worked on the blog and surfed the internet, and I drank.     In a way, it was writing this little journal that made me take a long, hard look at my life. It got me analysing myself in a way I'd long since forsaken. The image in my head, of the alcoholic, chain-smoking writer, sitting in front of his computer trying to write the poison out of his soul, no longer seemed so attractive. I was putting on weight. I wasn't sleeping. I felt spaced out and mildly ill most of the time.     I realised it was the limits. Always the limits. For Chris and I, the drinking and the partying started out as fun and then mutated into what it truly was: An escape. The more we realised this truth, the more we tried to outrun it. The faster we ran, the more likely it became that we'd hit the wall. And part of us, part of whatever that strange symbiosis was, desired the impact. The night this became clear to me was the night of the absinthe binge. And I know, with the benefit of hindsight, that what I did that night I did deliberately. I didn't run for the wall, I threw myself at it. I saw my limit, and I decided to go through it. Into The White, as the song goes.     It isn't the taste of alcohol, though I enjoy it. It isn't the feeling of being drunk, though I thrive on it. It's the limits that attract me. Something in me has to know them and flirt with them. I feel dead sometimes. I feel empty. And when you feel that way, knowing that there's a place where you can creep right up to the edge, where your body screams and burns and your mind has to process more than it can handle and you feel so fucking  alive ...well, it's an attractive proposition.     I quit drinking last week. Not forever, because it's a crutch I know I'm going to be needing again. But for now. I've taken up cycling. I've started looking for a new kind of limit. It's out there, I know it is. Tonight, riding hard up a steep hill with my lungs on fire and my thigh muscles spasming in protest, I felt it.     Adrenaline and alcohol are both about heat, and in a lot of ways they're alike. I know this because I lay on my bed a couple of hours ago, sweating and shaking and struggling for breath, my body protesting at the harsh regime I'd imposed on it. And you know what?     I wanted to go out and try a little harder.

        "Please&nbsp;take these words and do with them what you would like. It's a dream&nbsp;I had, drove me mad. It's&nbsp;just your time, it's just my fucking life."       &nbsp; It was loneliness and curiosity that first drove me to the internet. This was back in the heady days of '97, not long after my studies took me away from home for the first time. Seven years of experience makes it hard for me to recall exactly how I felt back then,&nbsp;but I know I was having a bad time. I was struggling to extricate myself from a long-term relationship with a girl I believed I loved, and my odyssey into the world of further education was not going well. A clerical error by&nbsp;UCAS (the body responsible for processing university applications) had sent me to a college in the hateful little town of King's Lynn, Norfolk. It had taken me three months of phonecalls to discover the reason why I was the only person on my course who was a) from out of town, and b) under 40. By the time I actually got to Cambridge, my fellow first years had already&nbsp;gone through the orientation and accompanying pub crawls. They'd found their cliques and chosen&nbsp;the people they were going to sit next to for the rest of the semester. Having just spent three months&nbsp;alone in King's Lynn, I quickly realised that my arrival in Cambridge wasn't going to change much. &nbsp; Which, in a nutshell, was how I came to spend my time wandering around campus like a lost soul, filling the&nbsp;gaps between lectures by exploring the area and people-watching, forever scribbling my observations in a small notebook that was never far from my hands. &nbsp; That notebook was what took me into the IT building, now that I come to think about it. I'm ambidextrous, but whichever hand I use, my writing is awful. Being PC-literate and a reasonably quick typist, I decided it would be easier if I spent a couple of hours at the end of each day bringing my scribblings together in a more legible form. &nbsp; And so it was that I came to have a password, a pocketful of floppy disks, and an appointment with a bizarre new social life. &nbsp; That first phase didn't last too long. I started exchanging e-mails with my friends back home and discovered an online community called The Globe (which no longer exists). The university computers didn't allow access to chat servers, but I got myself quite heavily involved in the forums there, masquerading under the username of HappyHarry (a reference to Happy Harry Hard-On, the DJ played by Christian Slater in the movie  urlLink  Pump Up The Volume  ). After a few months of this, my romance with the internet was rudely interrupted by real life. I'd been steadily making friends and getting into the university scene, and things between my girlfriend and I had improved. &nbsp; Then she cheated on me. &nbsp; Well, what could I do but reciprocate?&nbsp;I slept&nbsp;with her best friend, introduced myself to Mr. Jack, and then&nbsp;went on a&nbsp;insane drinking binge&nbsp;that drained what was left of my funds and left me in such a state that I had to borrow money from one of my new friends in order to be able to pay my train fare home once our exams were over. &nbsp; It was about five months after this that I finally said goodbye to university forever. A friend of mine was killed in a car accident and, having returned home for the funeral, I decided it was pointless going back. &nbsp; I got a job in a cinema,&nbsp;and my&nbsp;writing&nbsp;became the focal point of my life. I was working on screenplays back then, writing everything in my&nbsp;cramped and painful longhand. Looking back now, it seems incredible to me that I was able to churn out pages and pages of this stuff, spending my breaks and my nights off scribbling frantically&nbsp;in yet another of my many notebooks. &nbsp; It probably seemed incredible to my mother, too. I believe to this day that the main reason she brought a PC was so that she wouldn't have to watch me hunched over the table, obviously in pain, working feverishly on whatever my masterpiece was that week. &nbsp; That was my first and only PC. The computer that delivered me from the pain of my writing difficulties is the very same one I'm now using to tell you this story. The only things that are different are the keyboard and the mouse. That's one of the reasons I'm so reluctant to buy a new one. Me and this old thing have sort of a sentimental relationship. &nbsp; For this story, though, the most important thing about having my own PC was that I finally had access to chat. I made a triumphant return to the&nbsp;forums at The Globe, and quickly became addicted to the accompanying chat rooms where - as the months went by - I began spending more and more time. My main hang-out was The Rainbow Room. It was meant to be a gay room, but the vast majority of the people who frequented it were either straight or bi. As a chat newbie, I liked it because it was the friendliest place I'd encountered. &nbsp; I soon realised that the internet gave me freedoms&nbsp;I didn't have in real life. I was a quick and fluent typist with a better grasp of language and grammar than most. In a chat room, that conferred a kind of&nbsp;authority over the people that spoke in shorthand or couldn't write in the same way they could speak. I became a fixture in The Rainbow Room, one of&nbsp;a few&nbsp;that&nbsp;were expected to be there for several hours every night. I was always greeted warmly and people listened to what I had to say. They laughed at my jokes and offered advice about my problems. As HappyHarry, I felt like a different person. Like my namesake, when hiding behind the relevant media, I found I could  talk . &nbsp; More later, or tomorrow.

      Until I think up something interesting to say, you're just going to have to deal with me making stupid and pointless additions to the site, the latest of which is the Shoutbox, which you can find just below my profile in the sidebar. &nbsp; Leave random abuse! &nbsp; Chat to total strangers! &nbsp; Write poetry! &nbsp; Laugh wildly at how crap it all looks! &nbsp; Goddamn, I'm good to you people.

      I've killed the Guestbook and the FAQ due to the adverts. They were more for novelty value than anything else and the excitement of being able to fuck around with my own page has worn off. Questions and comments are more than welcome both below the posts and  urlLink via e-mail .  The tagboard is staying. I put it up more as an experiment than anything else. However, I like it, the regulars like it, and - despite it's many idiosyncrasies - it seems to have become a part of the page.  I'm done messing around for the time being. Inserting even the most basic of HTML commands into the template has been enough to cross my eyes on several occasions over the last few weeks. I think the basic layout with a few colour tweaks and some minimal graphics is more than enough. It's clean and attractive and I like it.  What do you think?

        "I can't see the end of me. My whole expanse I cannot see. I formulate infinity, stored deep inside of me."    My lighter ran out this afternoon. I've never been too hot at keeping hold of the things, so I tend to either buy disposables or just steal them from friends or even total strangers. Lighters are transient like that. Hell, the lighter phenomena could be a post in itself.  Which is neither here nor there. The most important thing about the transience of lighters is that a regular smoker will have at least seven of them in his or her living environment at any one time. I didn't panic when my lighter died. I knew its brethren were close at hand.  But could I find them? Could I fuck. I checked my writing desk, the accumulated debris beneath it, the top shelf of my wardrobe, even underneath my bed. No lighters. Not one.  Shit.  Because there's only one other place in The Darkened Room where one can be sure of finding a lighter. I didn't want to have to go in there, but addiction is often more powerful than fear. Indeed, it is fear that largely leads to addiction, and I  must  have my cigarettes.  If you have any appropriately sinister music, please feel free to slip it into your CD player now, because we're about to take a trip into the murky depths of...The Drawer Of Death.  Okay, everybody has a junk room or a junk closet or cupboard or whatever. Everybody has a place where they store those uncategorisable relics and memories and gimcracks that just don't fit anywhere else. But nobody has a Drawer Of Death. Nobody, that is, except me.  I didn't intend it to be a small shrine to all that is evil and forsaken in this world, it just turned out that way. At some point in the murky depths of the past, I reorganised The Darkened Room. Books, CDs, DVDs, clothes, writing stuff, alcohol, essentials, non-essentials...all found their place. I threw away all the junk I didn't want, and what was left was a bizarre tribute to the power of memory. I wanted this stuff, for a wide variety of reasons, but I didn't want it in plain sight and I didn't want it anywhere where I'd keep accidentally stumbling across it. Because once you're in the Drawer Of Death, you're in there for days, man. Maybe weeks. Maybe  forever .  I was fast, like a cougar or a shark. I yanked the Drawer open and scanned until my eyes alighted on the object of my desire, taking every care not to let my gaze linger on any other item.  There . I snatched the lighter and slammed the Drawer closed. Mission accomplished.  Only it wasn't, because one of the things I saw was a photograph. It was half-hidden beneath a pile of old letters, and all I saw was a leg. But it was  her  leg, and the photo was taken the night she wore  that  dress. These are notes from some other darkened room, notes that taste of tequila and smell like weed. They speak of kisses and whispered promises, of laughter and shouting in another part of the house, of sweat and friction and breathless memories I'd rather forget. Not because they're bad, but because comparing them to now is so painful.  I want another chance. I want to go back there and make it right, change it somehow, do or say something that means I don't have to end up here, feeling so stale and alone and tired.  I can't. I know that. So here I am. Here are the words. Here is the one thing I believe I do better than anybody else. I can't make it right, but I can make it beautiful. And wouldn't that be an epitaph for the ages?  Michael - He didn't make it right, but he did make it beautiful.  And there, friends, is a demonstration of the hideous powers lurking within The Drawer Of Death. It lures you with the promise of nostalgic comedy joy, then smacks you in the head with the baseball bat of remorse and sorrow. It is evil, and someday I will burn it.  But not today.

        "All I ever wanted, all I ever needed is here in my arms. Words are very unnecessary, they can only do harm. Enjoy the silence."     When Denise told me she loved me, I was sitting in the passenger seat of her car. We'd pulled over on the way home because neither of us particularly wanted to go there and we had nowhere else to be. So we'd decided to prolong the journey, to remain inbetween for as long as possible.    Hard to express how I felt in the moments after she'd said those three little words. I'm sure, if I think about it, that somebody must have said them to me at some point in my life. I just don't remember it. The first time I can clearly recall being told I was loved was that night in her car. It was a big deal to me. It was more than a big deal. It was everything.    I didn't say it back right away. I didn't want to react. I wanted to say it because I meant it, not because it was expected of me. I needed to think about it, to be sure of how I felt and what I thought I was involved in. I'm a great believer in following your instincts, but there are times when it's all too easy to confuse instinct and stupidity    Our relationship stepped up a few gears. We were still playing the same games, but there was a more serious edge to them, a sense that something really was at stake. Every orgasm was another step towards a place I don't think either of us understood. It stopped being about exploring for me almost immediately. It started being about doing these things with her because I loved her, and because there was no-one else in the world I wanted to do them with.    I told her I loved her, and as soon as I did, that love was tested.    "Would you ever...would you be interested in a threesome?" Denise asked me. We were sitting in the pub, late winter, talking over the top of empty pop music.    "In what sense?"    "In the sense that I'd like to try having sex with more than one partner."    "With another man, you mean."    "Ideally, but I'm not against the idea of a girl." She looked around for a few moments, took a drink, took a drag on her cigarette, shrugged. "Why not both?"    "Why am I suddenly sure you have this halfway planned already?"    She smiled and kissed me lightly on the mouth. "I'm sure I don't know what you mean," she said.    About three weeks later, I was sitting on the couch at her house with a friend of hers I didn't know. His name was David, and he was much, MUCH better looking than me. Denise had left us alone for random reasons of her own, and we were actually getting along quite well. I wasn't at all sure that this situation was what I wanted, but I intended to let things happen and then see how I felt rather than leaping to condemn her for wanting to try it.    "So...uh...you two do this a lot?" David asked me.    I laughed a little, more out of nerves than anything else. "First time. How'd you get here?"    "Into the weirdest conversation I've ever had, or the whole scenario?"    "Both."    "I went to college with Dee."    I had to ask. "Ever fuck her?"    "No."    "So...what...she just asked you to?"    "More or less."    "This is insane."    David nodded. "You're right. This  is  insane."    It was a couple of minutes later that Denise wandered back in again. She immediately sat herself down in my lap and we started kissing. And...I felt comfortable with that. He was the outsider, the one who didn't really know why we were doing this or what his role was. For all I knew of David, a girl he fancied had asked him if he wanted to get into a threesome with her and her boyfriend, and he'd accepted purely on the basis of a girl offering him no-strings sex.    We did it. I'm not writing this for the fine details. We did it and I enjoyed doing it, and in the process, I managed to ditch a fair amount of the discomfort I had regarding my own gender. I already believed that sexuality was a matter of socialisation, and that encounter represented my first steps on the road to practicing what I preached. All in all, I was happy. Not to mention that, shortly afterwards, we reversed the situation, and I got to have sex with two women at the same time. That wasn't such a groundbreaker in terms of my sexuality, but it  was  fucking awesome.    On we went. That was the last new barrier we really broke. After that, Denise seemed sated in a lot of ways. We went back to having sex of the non-kinky variety much more regularly. The part of our relationship that was all about love (and yes, I do separate love and sex in the context of Denise and me, though I didn't then) blossomed. For a while, I was very happy.    The reasons our relationship went downhill have no particular bearing on this story. Suffice to say, by the time it got to both of us heading away to university, we'd essentially broken up. I say essentially because I found it extremely hard to let go. She was studying in Nottingham, while I was in Cambridge. After a silent first couple of months away, we began communicating again. She wrote me a letter, I called her, we got away from the harsh words we'd exchanged and started building something new. I went to Nottingham to see her a couple of times.    Everything had changed, but I was blind. I was still seeing her with the same eyes. We got back to intimacy, but it wasn't long before I began to suspect that I wasn't the only one she was sleeping with. Denise would neither confirm nor deny this. She would only ever say that she was still 'finding herself'.    Words cannot describe how sick I got of that little phrase.    Denise never came to Cambridge during the five month postscript to our relationship. I was always the one that travelled. I think that applies emotionally as well as physically. She was who she was, comfortable with her evolution and with the things she wanted. She wasn't a whore. She never relinquished control and - to my knowledge - she never did anything she didn't want to do. I was the one beginning to feel pushed and bullied. I was the one whose eyes were beginning to open.    One night in Nottingham we went out with a gang of her friends and proceeded to get very drunk. From the Student Union bar, we returned to her halls of residence, where everyone piled into some girl's room and continued to drink, smoke, and talk. I was pretty well in the bag, but not so far gone that I didn't notice how many people were pairing off right there in the room and how far those couples were going without seeming overly worried about who was watching. I remember glancing across at Denise and catching her watching me, reading me, gauging my reaction. I mouthed the word 'no' at her and stood up.    "Wait, wait, wait." She caught me at the door, drunk and obviously excited. "Let's do this. I want you to do this with me."    "I don't think so."    "Why?"    "We were...we were stable before. Stuff like this was okay because I loved you and I knew you loved me, too. I'm not sure of that now."    "I love you," she said.    "Then let's go."    "We're into emotional blackmail now?"    "Works both ways."    "I'm staying," she said. She looked genuinely upset.    "I'm going."    "If that's the way you want it."    "I don't want it any way. If I could have it the way I wanted, we wouldn't be in this situation in the first place. Just so you know, I've got a pretty good idea of how you view this relationship or whatever it is now. I've never seen it as open, though, so if you're sleeping around, you're cheating. That includes tonight."    "I'm staying."    "Then goodnight," I said, and stomped off up the corridor.    I had nowhere to go. I was lonely and unhappy and I had only a return ticket that wasn't valid until the next day to my name. I went to the only place I could conceivably go. I went to Helen's room.    Helen was Denise's closest friend at university, or at least she was then. Denise had a crowd she partied with, and then she had Helen, the one she confided in. Helen was sensible by comparison, but then so was pretty much everyone else I knew. She seemed surprised to find a tearful Michael at her door at 2am on a Sunday morning, but she took it in her stride and showed me a kindness that's stayed with me ever since. She was a friend of a friend and she owed me nothing, yet she invited me in and listened to all I had to say without judging either me or her friend. As for what happened next...I'm at a loss.    Somehow she ended up hugging me. I was upset, she was torn between sympathy and friendship, I suppose, though I've never had the oppotunity to ask. Hugging became kissing, kissing became undressing, and so on and so forth. I didn't intend it, and I don't believe she did either. It was a mutual catharsis, and it lasted as long as it lasted. Once it was over, there was nothing between us.    The thing that always strikes me as really twisted is that my night with Helen is still the best sex I've ever had. Make of that what you will.    It was over between Denise and I, at any rate. We saw each other one more time, but that was only because I believed there were things left unsaid that I didn't want to carry around with me for years afterward. Once that was done, we went our separate ways.    I never hated her. I never even disliked her. I just think that it's inappropriate to drag a relationship along for the ride when you want to 'find yourself'. Denise is still the strongest woman I have ever met. She was open, she was fearless, and she was incredibly smart. She taught me a lot about sex and a lot about myself. I don't know where she is now, but I hope she's happy and I hope she found whatever it was she was looking for. I wish her well.    As for lessons learned and later experiences and all the webs of theory I intend to weave around these tales...well, those will have to wait for part 3.

       "And a thousand thousand slimy things lived on; and so did I."     Up early this morning, awakened from a short and uncomfortable sleep by the sound of female laughter, the doorbell ringing, someone rapping on the glass. I struggled out of bed and staggered onto the landing. More laughter, retreating footsteps.. By the time I got to the foot of the stairs, silence.    My visitor had stuffed a twenty pound note through the letterbox. When I opened the door, I found a carrier bag filled with bread and milk and a note that said "Buy yourself something nice."    I puzzled over this, but not for long. Twenty pounds is twenty pounds, and it was already approaching eleven o'clock. If I was going to shop, I had to be fast. I wasn't being caught in the midday sun again.    Four hours sleep had other ideas, though, and I lacked the energy for a shower. Instead I settled into a long, hot bath, resigning myself to starving until the evening. I've been in worse situations, and I had cigarettes.     When I emerged it was a little after twelve. I thought vaguely about returning to bed, but it was too hot. I was already sweating and it was as tough to breathe inside as it probably was out there. My eyes fell briefly on the banknote, sitting crisp and new beside my computer, and I remembered going out to the garage to fetch my bike last night, remembered glancing over at the tarpaulin in the corner and the machine it hid.  I could, I really could , I'd thought to myself. But I hadn't. We cover things with tarpaulins for a reason, and that reason is not always vanity.    I dressed quickly and snatched my stepfather's keys from the table as I left the house, making sure no-one was watching before sprinting down the garden and into the cool darkness of the garage. There it was, that ominous green tarpaulin, just shapeless and grimy enough to suggest some old wreck, perhaps a lawnmower or some kind of ancient bicycle, something embarrassing. But I knew the truth.     ***

       "It hurts to set you free, but you'll never follow me. The end of laughter and soft lies, the end of nights we tried to die. This is the end."     I've been meaning to do this post for a while, given that so much of this blog has already touched on sex and sexuality. I wanted to get it out from behind everything and do an essay/story on it, just so people stop mentioning a) how frustrated I've appeared lately, and b) the fact that I haven't posted anywhere near as filthily as promised. I don't think I'm going to get too dirty here, but there's a definite possibility of a controversial view or two. As usual.    So I was talking to my older sister tonight. It's actually fairly rare for us to meet up online, mostly because every time we do it becomes a debate about something. In this case, we kicked off with my lack of gainful employment, found our way along the well-trodden paths of my disdain for convention, then wound up arguing about what is or isn't natural in relationships and family. That, ultimately, is the point I want to get to in this series of posts. But the road to that argument is long and winding, and there's some fairly funky scenery. So let's do it.    Firstly, my views are obviously based on my own experiences and those of the people around me. I come from a broken home, and the very reason that home was broken was my father's drinking and infidelity. In the aftermath of the break, my mother saw a lot of different men. It was obvious why, even to a child. She settled in the end, but I don't think my father ever would have. The only thing that stopped that guy was death.    I was around a lot of relationships that shifted and changed and broke up and came together again. I can think of three stable, traditional partnerships within my extended family. The rest are all over the place. It seemed normal to me as a child and it seems normal to me now. To stay with one person forever is not, in my experience, the done thing.    I lost my virginity at either fourteen or fifteen. I've forgotten the exact date, telling you just how memorable the experience was. The girl who took it seemed to want to do so simply to get it out of the way. She was pretty popular, and I harbour no illusions that I was her first. I did have a huge crush on her, though, which was why saying no was almost unthinkable. That experience, in my memory, is a two-minute loss of self-esteem. That orgasm is not one that has stayed with me. That girl...I saw her a few weeks back. She didn't recognise me. I made no effort to be recognised. I noticed her and then kept my eyes resolutely forward. What would we say to each other?    I slept with a few other girls during my time at school and college, but there was nothing dramatic or exciting about those encounters. I don't recall actively caring about those people. If that sounds cold it's because I was a cold person then. Puberty was a nightmare for me. My father died, my mother remarried, we moved to a new town. I was cold because I didn't know how to express the sadness I felt in some way that would make it different to everybody else's sadness. The things I did were just things I did. I didn't attach significance to anything. I drifted through life like a ghost. And yes, there's no doubt that my behaviour during those times hurt some people. It was who I was. In some respects, I still am that person.    Sex came alive for me when I met Denise. I thought about not naming her in this story, but there's no point in anonymity. Anyone that knew me through that period of time knows who she is, and it's only a name to those that didn't. The chances of her reading this are somewhere between slim and none. But if she ever does, I'd like to think I'm going to give an honest account of her.    Denise bowled me over. She killed me. We'd known each other by sight as children, but never on a personal level. One bright summer day in 1996, I was walking out of a record shop in Edgware when I heard a girl calling my name. I turned around and there she was. Denise. Maybe five-feet-two standing on tiptoes, slim and pale and fragile like all the girls in my fiction since, owner of the blue eyes I got hooked on, of the wide and wonderful mouth that was usually either kissing or talking or trying to do both at the same time. If talking was an olympic event, Denise would be a multiple champion. I loved that about her. I loved talking to her, arguing with her, listening to her. In bed, I was always surprised at the way that beautiful mouth could frame itself around such dirty words. It seemed wrong somehow, wonderfully deviant, like graffiti scrawled on a priceless painting.    We were opposites in many ways. At seventeen, I was confused and emotionally uptight. I didn't know what I wanted from life, and I spent much of my time buried in books. I was studying politics and sociology, and the theories of Karl Marx were just beginning to set bells ringing in my mind. Denise was closing on her nineteenth birthday, taking a year out between college and university in order to make some money and - as she put it - 'find herself'. For my new girlfriend, this exploration became almost exclusively sexual. With the benefit of hindsight, she always had the zeal of a fresh convert to some cause. She could talk politics. She could talk about pretty much anything. But she preferred to talk about sex. She liked to voice new ideas and she preached the gospel of limits, a theory that's stayed with me ever since.    You're probably thinking, but Michael, that sounds like  fun . That sounds like a big ol' box of joy and sexual ecstasy. And you'd be right. It  was  fun. At first.    We fucked on the first date. And the second, and the third. We fucked anytime we could get away with it. I started staying over at her house. Just the night at first, then weeks at a time. I couldn't get enough of her. I'd turn up to her house from college and we'd go straight to bed if her dad was home. If he wasn't, we might just go for it in the hallway, or the lounge, or the kitchen. Then we'd take a shower and wander down to the pub, where we'd sit and toss theory around for a few hours before heading back home for more sex and then the kind of late-night, wrapped-in-each-other conversations that will always be my favourite part of any intimate relationship. That's a typical night in the early stages of our relationship. It wasn't every night, but that was mostly what we did.    In a way, she was training me. Training's the wrong word, but it fits. Maybe waiting for me to get acclimatised. The first few times we were intimate, she did everything. Over time, she encouraged me to come out of myself. I was falling for her, and she found it easy to get me to do things. Again, with hindsight, maybe I could have stopped the spiral that followed. But I didn't see and I didn't know.    "Don't you see?" she said. "This may be the only chance we get to do these things, to live like this. We should try it all, open ourselves up and see what happens."    I did see. But as it turned out, I didn't see in quite the same way. We started out with a little light bondage, nothing serious. We tied each other up, we played sensory deprivation games, we played with lit candles and ice cubes. We laughed while we did it, sometimes nervously, sometimes because it was genuinely ridiculous. It was always Denise who encouraged the next step. She'd ask me about my fantasies, ask me if I wanted her to dress up, if I liked the idea of taking her roughly or even hurting her. I wasn't comfortable enough with myself to answer those questions. I'd shrug or change the subject.    But we got there in the end. I  did  want to explore those things, but I didn't know how to say it. She seemed so bold to me, so fearless. She introduced a roleplaying element to our time together. She'd play the whore or the unwilling innocent, loving every minute of it. I'd be the embarrassed client or the lover that wouldn't be denied. Denise got so into her roles that she introduced a codeword in the event that things got out of hand.    "If I say 'red'" she told me, "it means I'm telling you to stop. Immediately."    That was how we got into the pain games.    Hell, I'm sure you've all had your own experiences. I'm sure you've read the books and seen the movies. Some of you, no doubt, have even got the T-shirt. So let's just say that, while things were escalating, it never got serious. There was no blood and no major bruising. My arms ached sometimes, and I had some pretty awesome scratchmarks about my person, but that was about the extent of it. We were having a lot of fun. Both of us.    Then she told me she loved me, and everything changed.

       "I could walk into this room, and the waves of conversation are enough to knock you down in the undertow."      Just gone midnight and it looks as though there's a storm on the way. That would be a pretty spectacular way to end an unspectacular day. I got to sleep at a sensible hour last night and was up and out by noon today.  Noon ! I can't remember the last time I was out in the sunshine in the middle of the day. I didn't explode into a screaming ball of flames or anything, but it wasn't pleasant. I've never gotten along too well with summer, but I'm a little worried I'm developing what amounts to an irrational fear. I won't go out in the daytime now unless I absolutely have to. Not in summer. Winter's fine, night time is fine. But not a summer's day.    Weird, eh? It's actually having an impact on me, mentally speaking. When I got home this afternoon, I felt incredibly weary. So much so that I immediately retired to my bed and dozed for a few hours. When I finally emerged, I stumbled downstairs and watched  Orange County , which was midly diverting and helped me clamber up the side of the small pit of depression I'd just been getting comfortable in. I then decided that I wanted, no,  needed  cigarettes.    I am now completely skint, by the way. No money whatsoever. I finished my last pack of cigarettes last night and resigned myself to the fact that I was going to be forced to quit. Tonight, though, in a sudden state of manic chirpiness, I bashed the head off the giant red jelly baby I keep all my change in, counted out the necessary money, and biked to the petrol station to fulfill my nicotine craving.    It's only temporary, though. I'm going to have to quit. Or become...a criminal.    Tempting.    Anyway, I am up for lengthy blog posts tonight, so I'm going to go get into it. The next topics are sex, sexuality, love, family...and whatever else falls in and around those categories. I doubt I'll be able to cover it all in one post, so I'll probably break it up a bit. Stop by, it'll be FUN.

      I've messed with the layout of the page a little more and also added a couple of new blogs to The Honour Roll. These came up during my random blog-surfing last night.     urlLink Gimcracker  describes herself as 'a neophyte screenwriter with a photography obsession who suffers from wanderlust screaming through her veins and an insatiable thirst for books, TV and fine wines'. Her blog's an interesting read and there are links to some of her fine photography.     urlLink Witt And Wisdom  is just...well, it's just plain awesome. I could read this page forever, I think. Well-written, interactive, occasionally thought-provoking, and frequently hilarious, this has just become the standard by which I'll judge all other blogs. Don't take my word for it. This one's a must-read.

       "I got more sick with every sour second rate kiss, everything I never would miss again."    Somehow I'm still conscious. Actually coming out the other side of this dead-tired thing now. Figures. I wanted to get to sleep by maybe four or five. Of course, the way insomnia works, I'll be wide awake as soon as my head hits the pillow.   I was writing an e-mail earlier, and I got to thinking that maybe I'd lost sight of the reasons I started this blog in the first place. Yes, it was about my writing and my politics and various crazy theories. But it was really about how I felt when I turned twenty-five. That was the theme of my very first post here, and I seem to have avoided it ever since. I think that's because my current malaise strikes me as extremely childish. My mid-twenties seem to have signalled something of a second puberty. Suddenly I'm questioning authority for very base and obvious reasons. Suddenly I'm analysing the way I feel in ways I've largely ignored for the past seven years or so. Suddenly I'm as horny as a ten-peckered owl.   No sudden growth spurts or embarrassing incidents of my voice cracking yet. I'll keep you posted.   I appear to be going through the things that many my age go through, while at the same time experiencing something I missed out on when I was twenty-one. I dropped out of university after the first year, and threw myself straight into a job. It was only then I began to feel that I'd left behind all the emotional baggage that plagued my teens. It was only then that I found myself and started having a good time. I didn't think or analyse at all. Work, drink, write, repeat. I was enjoying it, but it was all happening on a very visceral level. I was just existing. Which is no bad thing.   I climbed the promotional ladder with surprising swiftness, going from popcorn seller in a quiet suburban picture house to manager of a highly-regarded West London cinema in a little under two years. When I was twenty-one, I was making decent money, far more than any of my graduate friends.   I wasn't switched on. I was on auto-pilot. I allowed the routine of my work and my social life to take over. I never sat down and thought about what I was doing and why, what I expected to gain from it. The absinthe binge was what changed me. I haven't gone into great detail about it here because I've written it up so many times now that it bores me. For those still curious, there was a night a few years back when I got into a drinking contest that resulted in me downing eleven shots of absinthe (75% by vol., fact fans) in just under an hour. This on top of a night that had already been dedicated to the great God alcohol. I wound up in a very bad place, physically speaking, and I'm sure - with the benefit of hindsight - that I almost died that night.   After a hangover that lasted three days, I remember waking up and realising I felt okay again. The first thought that followed that revelation was  what the fuck were you doing out there ? I couldn't answer that question, and it troubled me enough to act as something of a wake-up call. I realised I'd drifted away from my writing and the things I wanted to achieve. Instead of fighting against the things I didn't believe in, I was removing myself from the world. I was giving in. Something had to change.   Two-and-a-half years later, I'm unemployed and living at home. Not exactly life as I intended to live it, but better than what I was doing. Better than being lost. I'm sure of myself now, and I'm sure of what I want. That makes all the difference in the world.   My point, I guess, is that twenty-five is one of those landmark ages. The closer I got to my last birthday, the more horrified I became. Suddenly I was an adult. It's not like being eighteen or being twenty-one. They call you an adult then, but it's accepted that you're not. You can still afford not to have a proper job or a steady partner or a mortgage. You've still got time to decide. You can still hang on to the last fragile threads that connect you to your childhood. Once you're in your mid-twenties, that's no longer normal. You look around and find that your friends are suddenly married and have careers and maybe children. Even those that don't are on that road. Things have changed. Suddenly you can no longer relate. Suddenly you start to feel very immature and very alone.   I refuse to feel that way. I think things like marriage and mortgages and careers are merely a process of acceptance. I think most people are frustrated and desperately unhappy and infected with a kind of insanity. I think we're pushed into these things with little or no choice. It's the way the world works. It's what everybody else does. It's traditional. It's...well...it's conservative. It's the ultimate behaviour of the herd.   Now, I didn't come here to piss on anybody's chips. Some of my friends are very happily married, and they tell me that they genuinely enjoy their careers and their lives and their property and their children. All good. I'm not saying those people are wrong. I'm not even saying those institutions are inherently wrong. What I am saying is that the moment you settle down, get married, and start dropping babies all over the place is the moment that you give up on your dreams. What do you think the mid-life crisis represents? Why do you think it is that the idea of a middle-aged woman going back to college after a divorce or after her kids are all grown-up is such a cliche? Why do you think men of a certain age tend to gravitate back towards the trappings of their youth, towards tattoos and motorbikes and young girls? It represents dissatisfaction and a desire to revisit that which has been lost. It represents stolen dreams.   I have many friends who encourage what I do, but even they tend to look at me from the corners of their eyes sometimes, as if wondering how it is I can possibly still be comfortable with my childish pipe-dreams. The general consensus is that it's something I need to grow out of, or that I'll meet the right girl and she'll change me.   Wake up call for those people: I do what I do because I believe with a passion that you'll never catch your dreams if you don't chase them. I won't change for anybody because I am what I am and I'm very comfortable with that. I won't ever meet a girl who persuades me that settling down is a good thing, because I wouldn't be attracted to a girl that desires such a thing. I'm not settling. I only have one life, and I don't intend to waste it looking at the same scenery with the same people day after day after endless fucking day. Maybe when I'm older, when I've achieved the things I want to achieve and gotten tired of lighting my candles with a flamethrower, maybe then I'll pick a place I love and want to call home. Until then, the only home I need is the one inside my head. I don't believe in marriage because I don't believe I need a ring or a legal document to prove that I love someone. If anything, I believe that dilutes the idea of love. 'Here. I love you, but just in case you're a little insecure about it, here's PROOF'. Hell, if you need me to prove it, I doubt very strongly that you ever loved me in the first place. I don't want children because I have no desire to bring a new life into such a hateful world. That's another one that may change someday, if I ever get past the fact that I know my beliefs would make me a terrible and conflicted father. I had one of those myself, and I've absolutely no desire to inflict that pain on another. I don't want to put down roots because I don't want to be tied to one place. I like that I can just move on if I want to. I like to walk away. I like to burn my bridges. I like to feel new.   That's me, and I sit here and judge you now only because of the massive judgement you have passed on me. Don't label me. Don't try to impose your belief system on me. Those aren't my rules and they never will be. I don't consider myself a genius. I don't consider myself above you. I accept the way you live your life, even though I don't believe in it. I would never try to change you because the reason we're friends is because I like you, not because you're like me. All I ask is the right to be me without your strange looks and your tendency to roll your eyes and this certainty you have that someday I'm going to wake up and join the rest of the world. Is that such a harsh request?    Above and beyond all the rhetoric and the bullshit of quarter-life crises and childhood dreams, what it boils down to is that, despite our differences, I believe in you. Unconditionally. I accept what you are and I'd never want to push you to a place where you feel you have to defend it.    So why can't you just believe in me?

       "If I should be short on words and long on things to say. Could you crawl into my world, and take me worlds away?"     Today is going to be the reverse of every single day I've experienced in the past month. See, my sleeping pattern has gone to a very strange place, and I need to re-adjust it because I keep having to be out in the real world doing sane things like looking for jobs and shopping. So here I am, feeling very tired and trying desperately to stay awake. Funny how these things can happen, eh?    My  urlLink Nedstat page  is a thing of wonder and beauty. Not only does it give me all kinds of fun facts about who visits my page and where they come from, but it also lets me know who comes to my page from  urlLink Google  and what they were looking for. This has given me the opportunity to chuckle at hits from people looking for 'Anna Kournikova knickers', 'Maria Sharapova', and oddly, 'blke porn'. I have no idea what variety of porn that might be, but I'm sure it's fascinating.    Today's random visit was from somebody looking for the following three words: 'Nurofen', 'overdose', 'limits'. I'm thinking this is either a potential suicide or somebody with a  really  bad headache. Christ, what if someone who wanted to kill themselves and was checking out the relevant medical information came  here ? Would it give them pause? Would it accelerate the process? These are not happy thoughts. I don't want people to read my blog then go overdose on painkillers. It makes me feel slightly guilty, like maybe I should have just named it 'Yes, The World Sucks. Throw Yourself Off A Building. It's Just Not Worth It Anymore', you know? Save people plowing through all this shit just to confirm their worst fears.    Then again, that sort of assumes that there are people out there who actually agree with me.    I'd never kill myself. Okay, I tried when I was fifteen. But things were different then. I was scared of the world. These days I deal with that fear by carrying a healthy amount of hate around in my back pocket. A  fuck the world  attitude will do many good things for your ego. I recommend it. The reason I don't kill myself now is because a) I'm not done yet, and b) I'm a sore loser. I don't expect to win, but then I'm not planning on quitting, either. I'm  fairly sure I'll end up settling for a draw in the great game of life, but I'll make  damn  sure that many people remember what happened when I stepped up to play.    That is the Philosophy According To Me. Do with it as you wish. But if you profit from it, you'll be hearing from my lawyers. They're sore losers, too.

       "Start with your eyes when they eye me in twilight, picking up pieces of mind. Tie me up with the twine in your eyelight, string me from heaven to time."         Autumn leaves are not beautiful. Motion makes them so. The wind playing in the trees causes those ripples of colour that so attract the eye, and it is that same element that eventually plucks them free, allowing a delicate and final journey to earth. A thousand metaphors are born, and none consider the truth.    As with the leaves, so with these streets. Dawn parts the sky for light to pour slowly yet irrevocably over this bleak, urban landscape. Yesterday's purchases are today's debris, given definition by morning. Crushed metal in the gutters, garish packaging lying torn and broken, flapping vainly in the breeze. False life. No thought, no feeling. A parody. A kinetic circus for an audience of one.    A gust of wind momentarily bloats a carrier bag and scrapes it across the pavement. Polythene on stone. It's a sound that can only ever be heard against a backdrop of silence. The sound of desolation. A soundtrack to nothing. The wind, as if offended, blows harder, and the bag takes to the air. As if on cue, a lone and unseen bird begins to sing the new day.    Another grey day. An army of clouds, thick and endless, roam listlessly across the sky, denying the sun's existence with lies burnished orange and fringed with gold. The tower blocks hold formation, pointing uniformly upward in a single, sad accusation. The trees, sparse and lonely, tremble with bitter humour. The bird sings on, gaining in confidence as one voice becomes many. A concert, for precious few moments, of nihilistic beauty.    But beauty is always stolen, and we are often the thieves. An anonymous woman shouts from an open window, a distant car coughs its first breath of the day, a plane slices open the sky. There are no miracles here. Just another day.    Another grey day.

         “… she said to a man, what do mean really want from women, and he said, blowjobs, and she said, you can get that from a man.”       I need a routine. Never thought I'd hear myself say that, but there it is. This past month has been an education in that respect. At least when I have work, when I have commitments and some kind of life other than the chaos inside my head, I can feel like I'm a part of something. Since I fled to The Darkened Room, I've been existing in my own little world, putting myself into other's lives only when absolutely necessary. My grandfather's funeral, numerous job interviews, mundane things like haircuts and shopping. Even then I felt unreal and disconnected. It seems I can only relate to the people around me at moments of high drama or epiphany.    Three days of constant consciousness. My system crashed just before lunchtime and I slept until nine this evening. Then I grabbed something to eat and slumped on the sofa in front of the TV, channel-hopping desperately, searching for something, anything I could get my mind around. A film I like, a familiar news item, a cartoon from my childhood. I needed to identify. I needed a counterweight for the hours I've been keeping and the thoughts I've been having. I needed to think or remember or even laugh. Just...something.    Closing on 2am now, and the biggest decision I have to make is whether to take advantage of my current state and try to grab a few more hours sleep before it gets light. I'm not sure if I could or not, but then I don't know how long my Judas mind plans on keeping me awake this time. I need to get out there later. I need to take care of this whole food/water/shelter issue by getting myself a job. Then I can relax a little, get back to talking to people instead of just typing at them all the time.    2am. No thoughts worth having. No stories worth writing. The manic frustration and cartoon hatred of yesterday has dissipated, leaving only a directionless fog of vague disgust. At the world. At myself. At whatever's closest. I do feel like writing, but rather than ramble, I think I'll kill this one here.

       "Hey. Wait. I’ve got a new complaint. Forever in debt to your priceless advice."     Seeing as the blog seemes to be geared towards hate rather than love recently, here's another pet hate of mine: Forwards.    See, I'm not actually interested in your stupid chain letters that promise wish fulfillment if I'll only force your greeting card idea of love onto five of my unwilling friends, and I'm not moronic enough to believe that you actually work for Microsoft and want me to help you test their new features in exchange for money. Neither do I care to contribute any of my hard-earned wage to some orphaned child that you invented because you think you're some kind of clever con-artist and not a complete tool.    I loathe those kinds of forwards. But there is a kind I loathe more. Not because it's worse, but because it comes from people I know. Yes, it's the  questionnaire .    'What's your favourite ice cream flavour?'  'What's your middle name?'  'What shoe size are you?'    Fuck off. Why do you care what my answers to these questions are? And why would having this knowledge enrich your life? Are you planning on buying me ice cream and shoes? No. You'll take one read of my reply, chuckle a little at my pathetic attempts to be funny, and then consign it to your recycle bin.    Just by-the-by, when did it become a RECYCLE bin? Are we somehow saving the rainforests by getting rid of junk e-mail? Or is it just a really DUMB idea somebody had to instill a sense of environmental awareness in a generation of kids raised on the internet. The recycle bin. Well, that changed the fucking world, didn't it? Try thinking of a useful feature for Hotmail, like an anti-suck filter. Hell, that'd kill at least three-quarters of the mail I receive on any given day. It'd make me a happier person, too, and stop me wanting to track you down and beat you about the head with a brick.    Whoops. What was I talking about?    Yeah...those questionnaires. I'm so sick of reading the same bland questions with the same bland answers that I've decided to design one myself.  This  questionnaire will actually help you to learn new and frightening things about your friends and/or enemies. Copy, paste, and send at will. I give you free license.     QUESTIONNAIRE            All questions must be answered truthfully and in less than thirty words. Failure to comply with these rules will result in millions of small children and fluffy animals dying horribly. If you forward this survey to everybody in your address book, beautiful people will suddenly want to perform oral sex on you, George W. Bush will fall into a really big hole, and Bambi's mother will only have sustained a minor flesh wound.           What do you wish your parents had named you?     When was the last time you hurt somebody (physically or emotionally)?     Who are you most jealous of?     If you could be a public figure, who would you be and why?     Which of the people you're e-mailing this to would you be most likely to sleep with?     Why?     Who are you going to vote for in the next presidential/general election?     Why? (If you're not going to vote, explain why not)     What was the last thing you said that you didn't mean?     What was the last thing you said to make yourself look good?     Name one person you pretend to like but don't.     What's the most painful thing that's ever happened to you?     Have you ever attempted suicide? Why?     What's your biggest regret?     When was the last time you masturbated?     What were you thinking about?     How much do you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?     If I asked you to close your eyes and think of love, whose face would you see first?     What if I asked you to think of hate?     Write your epitaph.    There. Fill out your own answers and post them in the comments box, if you so desire. If not, well, fuck you.

        "Life is a cement trampoline."      I'm well aware that it appears a UFO has landed in my neighbour's garden. This is what happens when you go webcam shopping and take the cheap option. Look more closely, though, and you'll see that it's clearly a  trampoline . Around midnight tonight, I plan on falling drunkenly through the hedge to bounce myself into unconsciousness.

        "You're going to be sending out some wonderful vibes -- so you don't need to be too obvious about your intentions. No matter how subtle you try to be, your feelings will come through, loud and clear."    That's my Horoscope for today. I'm not big on  urlLink Astrology , mind you. In fact, I have no time for it whatsoever. Makes me smile to think of people who actually believe in this stuff. Then again, I LAUGH IN THE FACE OF YOUR GOD, so this shouldn't come as too much of a surprise to anyone.  Anyway, it's early afternoon in the dull suburbs, and far too hot for a fair-skinned creature such as myself to even  consider  leaving the house. So here, for your perusal, are my alternative horoscopes for the day.   Aries:  Oh, man. I'm really sorry to have to tell you this, but your day is going to SUCK. I can't watch. Just...don't leave the house, okay?   Taurus:  You'll meet a handsome and intriguing stranger today. My advice? Don't get into his car. No-one needs sweets that badly.   Gemini:  You'll get a job today. Money will fall from the sky like rain. People will pass out from sheer pleasure whilst reading your writing. You'll be stalked by beautiful and deviant women. Then, unfortunately, you'll wake up.   Cancer:  They named an often-fatal disease after you. You're clearly cursed. Every day is an accident waiting to happen, and today is no exception. Sorry.   Leo:  You're hot today. But let's face it, you're hot every day. Just don't get carried away. Everybody's inner puppy gets kicked now and then.   Virgo:  That special someone will spend a lot of time thinking about you today. You don't want to know the context, though. Hey, this is astrology, take it the fluffy, cuddly way and shut the fuck up.   Libra:  If you were planning on staying in and watching a movie tonight, you probably should. Nobody likes you anyway.   Scorpio:  The moon is rising in the venus quadrant and the flux capacitators are at full-strength in the Mekong Delta. This means there's a fairly high chance that you'll be in some kind of vehicular accident around dinnertime.   Sagittarius:  Quit fucking around. Everybody knows you're gay anyway. Just admit it. No-one's buying into your pathetic soap opera act. Loser.   Capricorn:  Don't ask me.	   Aquarius:  I've seen your destiny, and I know exactly what it is you need to make your life complete. E-mail me your credit card details and all will be revealed.   Pisces:  You're going to be attacked by a horde of genetically-enhanced chickens that feel compelled to mate with you. But don't worry, the money you get for selling your story to the press will more than compensate for the total loss of self-esteem and the fact that people will point at you and laugh for the rest of your natural life. Oh, and your son, Chicken Man, will save the world someday.

      The comments on the blog are now powered by  urlLink HaloScan . This is largely due to encountering it on so many other blogs and realising how much more flexible and friendly it is than  urlLink Blogger 's default settings. Unfortunately, this does mean that all prior wordage on the blog has gone to the big comments box in the sky. Humble and grovelling apologies for that, but the update was necessary. Please feel free to verbally slap me around in the ALL-NEW comments section.  Some of my more observant readers may also have noticed some fresh linkage on The Honour Roll. I'll do a quick run-down:   urlLink Nausea Above The Garage  is Gregor's site, home to some extremely sharp and well-written literary work that you need to go and read immediately. Just...uh...come back when you're done, okay?   urlLink Stupid Evil Bastard  is a frequently updated look at just about every interesting aspect of culture you could possibly think of. Webmaster Les Jenkins has assured me that he is not a biker and will not beat the shit out me for linking him. So join, comment, argue, and laugh harshly. You can thank me later.  There is a  urlLink Blogchalk  on Mike Sizemore's site that claims he's 'The only Mike on the interweb worth stalking'. While my existence clearly refutes such a line of thinking,  urlLink Visible Monsters  is still worth your time. Check it out.  Regular service will probably resume later.

        "You’re stuck between the past and present tense. You said you’ve been waging a war against so many years of lies. With stronger drinks and longer lines it’s not that big a surprise that you're feeling more dead than alive."    High and lost. Skin stretched tight to define bones and cage flesh. Sound climbs the body in subtle reverberation, clinging to the precipice of sensation, demanding catalogue and analysis where the mind has none. Sweat bleeds, stings, inflames. Tomorrow's discomfort is tonight's epiphany, smiling at a world of strobing colour and pinwheeling limbs through salt-blind eyes.  Initiation is trial by violence. Welcome to the pit. Find the rhythm, find abandon. Let it go and lose it. Don't look back. A creature of impact and camraderie, a heaving organism of faces and bodies and liquid flying like shattered glass, catching the light and patterning the skin. Tomorrow's tattoos come in staccato explosions of blood punched and kicked and shoved to the surface. No surrender. Fall only into a safety net of clutching hands and momentary friends, where wide eyes and shining teeth speak of hysterical arousal. Thought made plural, forever.  Memory picks the pocket of time. I remember your mouth framing words, the language of your posture, the clothes you wore. How your tongue darted between my lips like a starving predator, arid and desperate kisses to steal my lust and make it your own. Your body was soft and yielding, screaming submission while your eyes spoke control. Your hands were insecure, clenching and trembling and demanding touch. You were pure white clothed in hate black. I was a junkie to the needle of your desires.  Cold streets and the stares of the stumbling lonely. Each touch a tiny revelation, a preach to the converted. Nicotine dreams and alcohol nightmares. Skyscrapers stoop to stare. My kaleidoscope spirals and centres on your backlit beauty. Words are indistinct murmurs, communicating only in pitch and timbre.  Judged by and compared to the icons on your walls, rendered in the harsh glare of bare bulbs, naked before your want. Unclothed dents and designs carved in your skin, obscene graffiti, evidence of acts yet to be committed. Creep up between your thighs like a criminal. Inhale your secret scent, taste your insides. Watch your mouth find definition around my lust, painting climax in glistening transparency. Invoke Gods, call down curses, beg for sacrifice. Impale yourself. Bring your lips so that I might devour your sighs. Punctuate silence, wish it harm. Silhouette yourself against a background of everything; spine rigid, eyes white, captured in extremity.  Be mine.

        "Naked in the cold sun, breathing life like fire. I Thought I was the only one, but that was just a lie."    1.  urlLink Michael Moore .  Why?  Because his self-serving little propaganda movies make a mockery of every intelligent argument against the politics that are currently ruining the world. Also, his attitude, manner, and face demand violence.  Method:  Dragged out of bed in the dead of night by faceless men in black suits, choloformed, and thrown into the trunk of a non-descript vehicle with no license plates. Never seen again.  2.  urlLink George W. Bush .  Why?  Like anybody needs a reason anymore.  Method:  Thumbtacks left all over the road at a strategic point in GWB's biking route. Crack squad of midgets in Bin Laden masks waiting in nearby bushes. With knives.  3.  urlLink John Kerry .  Why?  Because he's not going to win, thereby shattering the dreams of a generation and plunging us into a new dark age. Also, he's a weird-looking fucker and he creeps me out.  Method:  Handed a radioactive cyborg baby with huge fangs while pressing the flesh.  4.  urlLink Jordan .  Why?  It's harder to think of a reason why not. In fact, this entry is hereby expanded to include all publicity-seeking glamour models, 'It' girls, and any celebrity who has ever starred in a home porn movie that 'accidentally' got leaked to the general public.  Method:  Viciously attacked by a pack of wolves raised to enjoy the taste of silicone and Max Factor.  5. Everyone associated with  urlLink  Big Brother   UK.  Why?  Everything that's wrong with the world encapsulated in a single TV show. Makes me want to consult the Anarchist's Cookbook.  Method:  This weeks's challenge for the housemates - find the 18lbs of semtex cunningly hidden somewhere in the house. You have five seconds.  6.  urlLink The Libertines .  Why?  Just because the NME says you're the next big thing doesn't make it so. Unfortunately, your egomaniacal behaviour, rubbish music, and general 'trendiness' does give me the right to order your death.  Method:  ...Fuck it. They'll all be statistics in five years anyway.  7.  urlLink Avril Lavigne .  Why?  Let's face it, she's long overdue for termination. The music sucks, the whining drives me up the wall, and the fans make me wish for an automatic weapon.  Method:  Hung with one of those moronic ties.  8.  urlLink Ben Affleck   Why?  Because I admired you once, Ben. I thought you were a good actor. Now you have descended into a world of suck, and I think it's time you were put out of your misery.  Method:  Made to watch a marathon of his movie output in the last three years whilst being repeatedly beaten about the head with a rolled-up poster of J-Lo. Yes, until he dies. I don't care how long it takes.  9.  urlLink Harry Potter .  Why?  Words cannot describe my loathing for the Harry Potter Phenomenon. It's...just...why? The books are poorly-written, derivative trash, even for children, and the movies are nothing more than overlong commercials.  Method:  Fire. Lots of it.  10.  urlLink George Lucas .  Why?  Well, while we're on the subject of commercials, let's get to George. I've never been a  Stars Wars  freak, but I did see why the first two films were sort of cool. Since then, however, it's been a world of insufferable shit.  Episode II  was the second-worst film I've ever had the misfortune of watching. Yet still the nerd contingent will queue for miles to get their tickets and merchandise for  Revenge Of The Sith . George's untimely death is the closet thing we'll ever have to a guarantee of no more  Star Wars .  Method:  Forced to eat an item of Jar Jar Bings merchandise every time a ticket is sold for his next movie.  Unfortunately, any anger and frustration I might have vented through this entry has been nullified by the fact that I've had to post it approximately 16,000 times. This is because Blogger has developed an unfortunate and irritating habit of inserting random tags into my postings if I switch from writing them manually to using Blogger's composer.  But back to the point at hand. Who would be in  your  top ten?

      Based on the last round of feedback and specifically  urlLink Dan's  wish for less scrolling, I've made an attempt to expand the margins of the page and tighten everything up a little. Hopefully this'll make for easier reading. I've checked it in both  urlLink Firefox  and IE, and it all looks fine to me.   Any comments, complaints, or hysterical screaming about how you 'can't read it anymore' will be greeted with cynical amusement. Thank you for your time.

        "Baby, I can't stay. You got to roll me and call me the tumblin' dice."     Luke Reinhart's  urlLink  The Dice Man   is the tale of a psychiatrist seduced by the idea of the 'totally random man'. The novel, a cult bestseller that seems to have drifted out of the public consciousness over time, details how Reinhart's life changes as he progresses from putting simple decisions in the hands of chance to giving over his entire life to the whim of the die.  During the course of the story, Reinhart 'rapes' his next-door neighbour, impersonates Christ, inducts his children into the ways of the dicelife, and proclaims national habit-breaking month. Before long, he is teaching others the way of the die, encouraging them to roleplay in situations that are largely sexual in nature. Eventually, Reinhart's obsession results in his obeying the dice when they tell him to leave his wife and children in order to start dice-centres all over America. By the time the book draws to a close, his behaviour has him on the run from the FBI.   urlLink  The Dice Man   is a very, very funny novel, and I'd recommend it to anyone. It's also somewhat thought-provoking, and that's what I wanted to get into here...  Imagine giving over your life to the whim of the die. I've played games with them before, and it's possible some of you guys have, too. On several occasions, my friend Chris and I ventured into London accompanied by a die. We'd make six choices and then roll to see which option the die would have us take, whether it be pints in a quiet pub or shots in a rowdy nightclub. Then we'd let the die decide exactly what we were drinking, and so on. Key to the philosophy of  urlLink  The Dice Man  , though, is the idea that at least a couple of choices should be things that you wouldn't ordinarily do, or even things that don't appeal at all. In this way, you'd be indulging not just in behaviour that you actively enjoy, but immersing yourself in new situations and even personalities, thereby creating a personality that is 'totally random'.  I found something similar online the other night in the form of an  urlLink 'Ask The Oracle'  test that allows you to write down five different options. It asks you questions about your choices and - depending on your answers - offers a best course of action. I gave it a whirl and it advised me to e-mail a girl I barely knew but thought was kinda cool. I followed this direction and found myself throwing letters back and forth with her in a manner I'm really beginning to enjoy. Give it a try.  But again, this isn't completely random. The 'Oracle' simply reflects your own desires by asking questions designed to give away how you feel.  But being totally random, if only for a week or so? I'm thinking that maybe, when I have a few more links and stuff, or even now if folks are up for it, a few of us could spend a week allowing certain decisions to be made by the die. It'd be pretty crazy to see what would happen, and would no doubt make for some fascinating blogging.  Anybody up for it?

        "I'm a riddle so strong, you can't break me. Did she come here to try, try to take me?"    A huge storm just hit sunny Hertfordshire. I was at the job centre, the last stop on what had been a frustrating round-trip to deal with various people regarding jobs and money. When I left the house earlier this afternoon it had been sunny and warm, just another Lynchian day in suburban nowhere. I walked out to the Oaklands motel in no mood to be fucked with. My head was pounding and my sinuses felt as though they were backing up into my brain.  The strange wiring in my head has always been particularly sensitive to the weather, especially rapid changes in temperature and summer storms. I suffer head pains and nosebleeds at certain times of the year, most notably in April and September, and I can usually tell you a storm is on the way long before it shows itself in the sky.  I've been in an ongoing state of negotiation with the Oaklands people for two weeks now. I dropped an application form into their reception a couple of Fridays ago and heard back from them a few days later. They were interested, they said, but my application had been misplaced. Was there any chance I could come in and fill out another? Of course, I said, and duly complied. Last Saturday, a little confused at the lack of contact, I phoned to see what was going on. I was told that they didn't look at applications over the weekend and that somebody would call me on Monday. Nobody did.  Today I walked straight into the bar and grabbed the first member of staff I saw.  "Hi," I said. "Is there a manager around?"  "Can I ask what it's regarding?" she replied, without looking up from the table she was wiping.  "A job," I said. "I was expecting a phonecall yesterday."  "Oh, right."  The girl disappeared into the kitchen and I lit a cigarette. My hands were shaking a little, and for the first time it occurred to me how angry I was. This whole job-hunting trip has become a nightmare of unreturned calls and long, frustrated days of fruitless searching. I know I'm far more employable than the morons I'm spending my time talking to, yet somehow nothing's falling my way this time. I haven't had a single break.  The assistant manageress emerged smiling. She looked open and friendly, nothing like the monobrowed neanderthal I'd dealt with the last time I was at Oaklands.  "What can I help you with?" she asked.  "Hi," I said. "My name's Michael. I dropped an application in here a couple of weeks ago. Darren called me a few days later and said you were interested in employing me but my form had been lost. I filled out another but then didn't hear anything for a week. I phoned on Saturday and the guy I spoke to said someone would call me back yesterday. No-one did."  "Oh." She frowned. "I didn't get that message."  "I was hoping we could sort it out. I'm trying to apply for other jobs as well."  I knew immediately that it had been a stupid thing to say. Her face hardened almost imperceptibly, but it was enough to tell me that I'd shown a little too much of my annoyance.  "Okay. Well, I'll look up your application form and give you a call later."   What the hell , I thought.  Let off some steam .  "I'm here now," I replied. "I don't mind waiting."  "Listen, Mr. O..."  "O'Mahony," I said, and offered a truly horrible smile.  "We have a lot of applications to get through and we're a very busy establishment. Now, either myself or one of the other managers will undoubtedly be in touch in the next couple of days."  "What happened to later?"  "I..."  "Jesus, the incompetence of you people is unbelievable. All I'm asking you for is a fucking job. Considering the idiots you employ, I'd be a godsend."  She stared at me, her face devoid of expression. I wasn't shouting. My voice was low and perfectly calm.  "Never mind," I said. "I wanted to work here because it was convenient for where I'm living. I don't need it."  And I turned and walked out.  Despite the fact that it was well past noon and drifting into mid-afternoon, the day appeared to be getting hotter. By the time I made my way down into town, I was sweating freely. I had two bags of ten pence pieces in my pockets. I've been out of hard cash for a few days now, and my collection of change has become my cigarette fund. All I'd intended was to exchange the coins for a ten pound note, but even this was a hassle. First I walked into HSBC, who I bank with, and found a queue that stretched as far as the door. Thinking I could get the money changed elsewhere, I headed back out and a little further up the high street to TSB.  "Good afternoon, sir," The girl behind the counter said.  "Hi," I said, dumping my bags on the counter, "I just need to get these changed for a ten pound note."  "Certainly, sir. If I could just have your account number."  "I don't actually bank with you. I just wanted some change."  "I'm afraid we only give change to customers."  I sighed. "Why?"  "Company policy, sir. Who do you bank with?"  "HSBC."  "I'm sure they'll be more than happy to change it for you."  "I've just been there," I said. "There's around a million people in a very small room and only one person behind the counter. Can't you just..."  "I'm sorry, sir. I can't."  "This is..." I began. "...ah, fuck it."  I snatched up my change and headed back to HSBC, where I queued for almost forty-five minutes for a transaction that took around ten seconds. By the time I began my walk down to the job centre, the sky looked bruised and swollen and a light breeze tugged at my clothes and hair. My head felt swollen and pregnant with pain. I couldn't stop sneezing.  I knew exactly which job I wanted to apply for. All I needed from the job centre was a covering note. Yet the man behind the desk insisted on taking all my details, spelling my name wrong at least six times until I was almost screaming each letter at him.  "What's your race?" he asked.  I blinked. "Are you serious?"  "I need to fill out the equal opportunities section in your file."  "I'm Hawaiian," I said.  He actually started typing.  "What are you doing?" I was aware of my voice rising, of heads turning in our direction. "Look at me. Just stop what you're doing and look at me. My name is Michael O'Mahony. I am without a doubt the whitest person you have ever seen. How in god's name can I be from Hawaii?"  To his credit, he had the decency to look ashamed, and the rest of the interview was conducted in low, tolerant voices.  The storm broke as I crossed the road outside the job centre. Large drops of rain fell here and there. Thunder rolled massively across the sky directly overhead. I caught a glimpse of forked lightning in the distance as the world momentarily took on an electric blue outline. The rain quickly became torrential, and in seconds I was soaked to the skin, my clothes plastered to my body, cold rivulets of water streaming down my face and the back of my neck. I felt a stab of euphoria in my belly. Suddenly I could breathe through my nose again. I inhaled the musty scent of the storm and then held my breath for a few moments. When I let it go, I felt the pain beginning to ease, as if I could exhale it.  I smiled and then laughed, spreading my arms and turning my face up to the sky. The driver of a passing car leaned on the horn and shook his fist at me triumphantly, his face lit by a huge smile. I turned away and began to run towards home, happy for the exertion that stole my breath, for the endless sheets of rain driven into my body. I was elated, alive, and as I ran I heard Layne Staley singing in my mind.   Did she call my name? I think it's gonna rain, when I die.   From a bad day to a good one. Sitting here now, I still feel a little high. The storm is weakening outside my window. I've spent the last hour typing almost frantically, Alice In Chains playing at high volume in the background. I feel like a man with a scream in the back of his throat. I feel like my mind's travelling at a thousand miles an hour through a maelstrom of clouds and rain and light and noise.  I wish it could always be this way.

        "Writing is a form of personal freedom. It frees us from the mass identity we see in the making all around us. In the end, writers will write not to be outlaw heroes of some underculture, but mainly to save themselves, to survive as individuals."    Please understand, I'd never wanted to be a writer. It wasn't something that called to me. When I was a child I wanted to be a bus driver like my dad, then a fighter pilot, then a rock star. My primary school English teacher used to make me stand and read my poetry in class, but I was far more proud of the fact that I could recite my seven times table faster than any of my peers. I didn't like to sit and write. I liked running and playing football. I was a physical child back then. I was a happy child.  I couldn't pinpoint the time when all that changed. Not exactly. My parents broke up when I was six, divorced when I was twelve. Neither seemed especially relevant. I rarely saw my father anyway. Nothing really changed.  Again, I come back to his death. I don't like to obsess over that one fact, but everything I've seen and done since that day has been a little different. It was a shift in perception, in the way I catalogue and prioritise, in the way I look at the world around me. On the weekend of 22-23 January 1994, I finished reading  1984 , I wrote the first serious poem of my life, and my father died.  In terms of destiny, I guess you could say it was a key couple of days.  I stopped being a physical child. I became very introverted. I started to enjoy my own company more than that of my friends. I buried myself in music and films and literature. As a person, I changed almost totally.  I was still four years away from wanting to write, though. That didn't happen until February of 1998 when - fully involved in the Socialist Party at my university - I took part in a 24-hour occupation of the library to protest the introduction of tuition fees. The occupation itself was an exercise in boredom, but what happened later that night changed my life. Four of us slipped away through a back window to where we'd been told there was a quarry that had long since become a lake and...well...I've fictionalised this before. Let me share that.   I ended up slipping away from the party with an Irish girl, Mary, and a German poet called Thomas. Though it was February, Thomas had suggested we go skinny dipping in a nearby lake that had once been a quarry. Mary and Thomas and me, we staggered through bushes and trees, fell over barbed wire fences, teased each other mercilessly about the possible presence of guard dogs. We found our way to the banks of the lake and Mary sat down, eyes shining and cheeks flushed as she watched Thomas and I undress. I was fearless then. No shame in my nudity. Thomas and me, we waded out until we were knee deep in water that was so black that the light of the moon was repelled, dancing across the rippling surface, throwing wraiths of shimmering luminescence across our naked bodies.  I admired Thomas, though I never knew him well. He did university for the freedom. He played pool and drank all day and invented powerful lyrics that he never wrote down. I saw him perform once, at a poetry evening full of pale young men and women that read from notebooks in quavering voices and smiled nervously when they were finished. Then Thomas, striding onto the stage, dressed without thought for the occasion, stamping back and forth, his voice soaring to screams and falling to whispers, every line a thing of beauty. He lost his voice that night and there was no applause when he finished. When his voice cracked and then trailed off into silence, his monstrous composition unfinished, the only sound was of forty or fifty people trying to get their breath back.  But Thomas didn’t go into the lake that night. As my legs turned numb and my mouth began trembling uncontrollably, I heard him giving up and floundering back to the bank and the warmth of clothes and Mary. I shut them both out, though I could hear laughter from somewhere behind me. This was the top diving board again. This was Malta in 1991. The words that came to me, from something I was reading at the time and can’t remember now, were: "Last time pays for all."  I came so close. Then I jumped.  That was when I seriously decided to be a writer, although I have never found the words to describe what I felt that night. The water stole all sensation from my body. Physically numbed, I had only my thoughts and my feelings. I was swimming in a cliché, the moon and the dark water and the distant horizon beginning to show dawn, shading the sky a subtle mixture of blue and scarlet that bled between the bare branches of the trees. Elation is the only word that describes the emotion that swept through me, though it isn’t strong enough. I stopped swimming. I let myself be held by the freezing water and screamed at the birth of a sunrise. It is still the loudest sound I have ever made.   That's not the best piece of fiction I've ever written, but it's probably the most personal and the most important. Walking home from the quarry that night, I felt incredible. I felt like a different person. It was the stuff of epiphany or revelation, and I wanted to scream it from the rooftops. As time went by, though, I realised that it wasn't something I was going to forget and that talking about it hadn't shaken those sensations. I felt  heavy  with this experience, sick with it. I needed to get it out somehow.  So I wrote it, first as a screenplay called  Good Intentions , then as part of my first full-length story,  Scenes From An Unexamined Life . Neither of these projects will probably ever see the light of day, even if I do get published, but a reasonable percentage of my readership has encountered  Scenes...  in some form or another.  I've heard quite a few creative writers of one kind or another describe the process as being a kind of mental vomiting, and I suppose that's true to an extent. Sometimes an idea just grabs you and refuses to be shaken off until you give it detail, until it becomes a story or a poem or just a loose collection of words. The necessity for me is always definition, the journey from a dream or a feeling to a piece that captures that raw emotion and gives it coherency in such a way that it can be expressed to others.  Honestly, though, that's rare. The vast majority of the time it's a case of thinking, "Hey, wouldn't it be cool/funny/tragic if  this  happened" and then trying to make something of it. Some days it comes easy, others it doesn't come at all. In a way, it's like blogging, only less selfish.  My current project is called  Welcome To Forever . It's going to be a book of short stories linked by a theme, or a novel in which every chapter features different characters and scenarios, depending on your perspective. It's struggling out of the blocks at the moment, what with the current state of my personal life. But once I get settled, I hope to bury myself in it and have some kind of first draft by the end of the year. What I'd like to do, over the weeks and months to come, is share a little of the creative process with the people that read this blog. I usually e-mail drafts and chapters of things I'm working on to friends, and I'd like to take that a step further by posting things as I write them. I don't intend to post the whole novel, but it'll be an interesting experience for me to get thoughts and feelings on a work in progress.

        "It is an old observation that the best writers sometimes disregard the rules of rhetoric. When they do so, however, the reader will usually find in the sentence some compensating merit, attained at the cost of the violation. Unless he is certain of doing as well, he will probably do best to follow the rules. After he has learned, by their guidance, to write plain English adequate for everyday uses, let him look, for the secrets of style, to the study of the masters of literature."    I've been reading a lot of blogs lately, many of them penned by people who consider themselves writers. Now, I'm not the greatest writer in the world, and there are plenty of unpublished folk out there doing it better than I, but some of the elementary mistakes I've seen have been scary. For various problems of grammar and composition, this blog heartily endorses and recommends  urlLink The Elements Of Style  by William Strunk, Jr. Not only does this concise tome cover the basics of writing the English language, it does so in a fashion that is easy to understand and, frankly, hilarious.  It isn't that Strunk intends to be funny, more that the book was published in 1918, and reflects the language and standards of the time. Thus, while Strunk is a magnificent teacher, he also strikes me as being the kind of fellow who would slap one about the face with a glove and demand a duel. His retorts towards those that would descend into bad grammar are wonderfully amusing. They alone make this text a must-read.  Think you can write? Think again.  urlLink The Elements Of Style  will show you the bright and shining path to basic English. And if you still disagree, I daresay Mr. Strunk and a choice of pistols will be waiting for you in the woods behind the manor house tomorrow morning.

        "I've been looking for a reject, and you ain't had nothing like me yet. Don't you think it's time for motion? I can take what you've been pushin'"    University is traditionally a place for exploring. I was a little ahead of myself in that respect. While all around me were indulging themselves, I was wallowing in self-pity and thinking constantly about the girl I'd lost. I had a good time at university, but in many respects I returned to my previous uptight persona. I smoked and I drank, but that was about it. I just couldn't bring myself to rub salt into the wounds I already had. When I did go off the deep end, it was into alcohol rather than sex. As every man knows, it's difficult to combine the two.  If I could do it again, though, I'd do it the exact same way. University taught me a lot. Whilst living in Cambridge, I was far more an observer than a participant. I watched a lot of strange and desperate behaviour. I sympathised and I empathised. Sometimes I was disgusted, others heartbroken. In the end, what changed was my perspective. I realised a lot of things about my own sexuality and about the way we tend to put those we desire on a pedestal, overlooking their flaws.  I was writing a lot more by then, and articulating those thoughts on paper made it easier for me keep track of them. I could happily sit there and debate myself for hours, scribbling arguments and counter-arguments in my notebook while Soundgarden or Pearl Jam filled my room with background noise. It was a lonely time, but I enjoyed it. Sometimes we need to step out for a while.  If I believe any one thing that Freud said, it's the idea that we're all born 'polymorphous perverts'. I can't bring myself to even consider the idea of such things as a 'gay gene'. It's convenient for a lot of people to throw homosexuality or bisexuality into the same box as defects like being blind or deaf. It means not having to confront these things, not having to fly in the face of so much tradition and socialisation.  Nobody is born with an in-built instinct towards heterosexuality and nuclear families and rearing our children the way we do. These are things passed down to us, things taught. They are the church and the school and the family and the media. They aren't 'natural', not by any definition of the word.  We live in a very repressed world, sexually speaking. The most powerful nation in this world is seeking to prevent same-sex marriages. It is trying to pass what is, in essence, anti-love legislation. Religious ideas of fidelity are still alarmingly popular. Porn is bad. Healthy, kinky sex between consenting adults (anal sex, for example) is frowned upon. The 'norm' is still one man and one woman coming together in sexual union for the purposes of procreation, preferably within the sacred institution of marriage.  What year is this again?  For the record, I support gay rights. I support straight rights. I support the rights of any consenting adult who is doing something that he or she enjoys that couldn't and doesn't harm or otherwise injure any other living creature. I don't believe it's the business of any government or institution to interfere with those rights. It's called freedom, and it isn't a difficult concept to grasp.    "I've always felt that sexuality is a really slippery thing. In this day and age, it tends to get categorized and labeled, and I think labels are for food. Canned food."
