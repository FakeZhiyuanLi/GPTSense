      So it's late at night and I'm on my way to work. I'm lying in bed trying to catch those last few minutes of sleep before our cruel system of working in order to survive robs my nighttime.  Anyway, I have the Discovery Science channel on. There's this show about stars and supernovas, nebulas, and a whole bunch of other stuff I never paid any attention too in high school. Basically when a star explodes (supernova), it creates an environment for other stars to compress and form. In this mass of baby stars, and old star dust, there is a highly competitive system to form what may come next. Stars form and some of those failed baby stars may end up becoming planets.  It also said that the basic elements of any of these formations are oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, iron, and some of the other simpler materials on the periodic table. More complex items are formed as gravity compresses these atoms and changes them. Coincendently, these simple atoms are the same materials which make upthe basic necesseties of what we call life. So taking this idea further, it is reasonable to believe that our Earth was at one point a star that just never finished forming, and that all of the life upon is also formed through the same basic idea of compression of these basic galactic materials. That makes humans only about 3 notches down from being celestial beings.   I may be the only one who finds that interesting, I was at work, but that's what blogs are about.

      Is it possible to nominate yourself for that show? I'm having a really good week. Not the best week I've ever had, but probably one of the better ones since that show first aired. Besides the fact that some things are really turning around for the better at work, here are the highlights.   Sunday-  Bocce ball tournament. We got shut out of the first game, and came back to finish in 2nd place in the consolation bracket. Not to be cocky, but I was on fire. We'd've won if we hadn't lost control in the final game. Oh well, we did far better than we expected ourselves too, and like I said, I was money, we all played well.   Thursday-  For just under two hours of work, I win $400 playing $5-10 poker at the local poker room. I was gonna take that money and buy an iPod, but I don't think I have the right hook-ups on my computer, not sure. It was a Mac guy trying to explain it to someone with windows, either that or he was speaking French.   Tommorow-  Going up north for a whole week. No work, just beer, more beer, and sleep. Aaaah, sleep.  Chizzle Fist is having the best week ever. Next post after I get back.  &nbsp;

      ...to making my blog as annoying as it was before. Trying to figure out this HTML stuff, again. The difference is this time the pictures work, thanks to  urlLink Hello.  I'm still not happy with the template and I am browsing the hell out of everything trying to find one, if you know any good spots, let me know. Also, if you know Anna, let her know to come by and visit my page.

       urlLink    Roger Clemens hides his head in his jersey, having given up 6 runs in the first inning of Tuesday's All-Star Game. This was supposed to be Roger's triumphant homecoming, sealing the deal as the best pitcher around in his 18 year career. Instead he let the American League hit for the cycle, in the first inning! A single, a double, a triple, and not one, but two home runs. Being the anti-astro, I cannot help but enjoy it, even though I did want the NL to win. Thanks a lot Roger. Hey, atleast you're the best pitcher on a team about 15 wins behind where they're supposed to be, and atleast you're not still playing in Canada.&nbsp; urlLink

      From the last top ten list;  Yes, Highlander is number 2. I will defend that decision as long as I have to. Highlander is awesome! I'll conceed that maybe Austin Powers should have made it up there, but at the time of making the list, it didn't come to mind, so that kinda says where it ranks, doesn't it? And yes, the Jack Ryan movies do count, but they're just not my bag, baby. You would also have a hard time getting me to list a trilogy where the actors changed (i.e. Harrison Ford to Ben Affleck). Taco Taco.   Since I made the list, I also thought of a few more, Indiana Jones and National Lampoon's Vacation, so consider those two and Austin Powers for honorable mention. I think my love for trilogies has gone beyond a simple top ten list.

      Top Ten Trilogies of All Time  10) Alien (the same rules for Rocky and Star Wars also apply here)  9) Blade (this'll move higher once I see the third one in Dec)  8) The Naked Gun (yes, it is so a trilogy!)  7) Rocky (IV and V don't count)  6) The Matrix (after a while, I stopped trying to understand what was going on, but I just hoped the fights looked good, and well, they did)  5) Star Wars (the first 3, which are actually the middle 3)  4) Mad Max  3) The Godfather (yes, I am aware #3 sucked, but #1 & #2 would make me put it up here anyway)   2) Highlander  1) Lord of the Rings (if they make the Hobbit, this'll move from my favorite trilogy to my favorte tetrology, don't have many of those yet)

      I think I will be really upset when Hollywood decides to stop making all these comic book movies. I really cannot get enough of them. Even Punisher wasn't so bad. They're filled with great action scenes. They're movies driven by complex characters than we are able to empathize with. The good ones start to explore why we idolize heroes, and what characteristics make up the finer points of human beings.  I just saw Spider-Man 2 yesterday. An awesome movie. It was deep, dramatic, filled with action and romance, and those cheesy Spider-Man kinda lines you have to laugh at. "Take your vitamins, eat your vegetables, kids."  Also, I just found out they are gonna have a new Blade coming out in December. Making it a trilogy, and I am beggining to realize how much I love trinities. I think I feel a top ten list coming on.

      Best Strip Clubs I've Been To In the US  10)Airport Lounge- Milwaukee, Wi. If you've got nothing better to do, and you don't feel like driving to any of the other places around, this will suffice. $5 cover, you might find a hot one to cling onto. If you do, tell her she needs to dance at #7 on the list. Plus, you might be able to convince your significant other to go, because there's male dancing downstairs.   9)Texas Charlie's- Kenosha, Wi. Not bad, but depending on who you are, you might enjoy one of Kenosha's many porn shops just as much.  8)Performing Arts Center- Milwaukee, Wi. I was really drunk, and I almost got kicked out, but I do remember thiking, "This place is better than Airport."  7)On The Border- Franklin, Wi. Cleverly named because it's a bout a block down from the next county line. Great women, who will ask you for tips a lot as they walk around, but they also will play pool with you and do a few shots, so it's not like they can't have a good time. 3 words, ride for five, the only woman to be in Playboy, Penthouse, and Hustler sat on my face for $5 that I borrowed from my girlfriend at the time. That kinda story sums up anything.  6)Silk- Milwaukee, Wi. Classy joint. Same quality women from On The Border, some of them use to dance there, but without hassling you for tips if you're just sitting there. Any palce that can convince me to spend my last $40 on a t-shirt two sizes too small for a dance, has figured something out.  5)Chubby's- Wisconsin Dells, Wi. Full nudity, full liquor, cheap cover, and great women. Highest one on the list from Wisconsin. A little bit of sin in one of the famliest places in the country, kinda like going to the adult book store at Epcot.  4)Olympic Gardens- Las Vegas, Nv. There's a reason that there are two Vegas clubs on this list. The reason mostly that I only went to two clubs in Vegas. What the hell am I doing here?  3)Glitter Gulch- Las Vegas, Nv. It's Vegas, you think a place like that will dissapoint? No. But the waitress expected a tip for getting me singles, after I tipped her for the beer. Bring money.  2)Admiral Theatre- Chicago, Il. First one I ever went to, expensive cover, no liquor, but very hot women, and bouncers that may or may not be mob connected. It's my first place, it has to be on the list  1)Babes- Ft. Myers, Fl. $2 cover, beautiful women, practically no rules, what more needs to be said?
