      Heard about this on the radio today...   urlLink bitterwaitress.com   Be warned, if you are offended by foul language and/or people speaking their minds,  DO NOT  go to this site.  The particular section I have linked above is the " shitty tipper database " as named by the site.  It features celebrities (for the most part) who have left questionable tips for their waiter/waitress.    Some make for an interesting read.

      Yeah, that's right, it's  Blue Bell .  And I'm here to report they are doing some awesome things this summer.   urlLink Check out  all the cool flavors just for the month of July.  My personal favorites are Key Lime Pie (duh!) and Cookies! Cookies! Cookies!.  No, I'm not exaggerating with the exclamation points on that last one. That is the actual flavor name as printed on the side of the carton.  For those of you too lazy to click above and read for yourself, here's a description:   Key Lime Pie  -  Contains sweet and tangy key lime ice cream blended with crunchy graham cracker crust and a creamy whipped topping swirl.    Cookies! Cookies! Cookies!  -  Brown sugar ice cream containing pieces of chocolate chip cookie dough, chocolate cr√®me cookies and oatmeal cookies.   Allison and I were at the store the other day when we came upon the ice cream section.  As I put Cookies! Cookies! Cookies! into the cart, I said: " How can you  NOT  buy an ice cream that's yelling at you about it's flavor?!?!!? " It was a no-brainer. Even at $5.99.  And after several repeated taste tests, I'm here to report that it is every bit as good as it sounds.  Droooool.  " We eat all we can and we sell the rest. "

      Yeah.  Sometimes traveling can suck.  Why?  Because you catch things from other people on airplanes due to the whole recirculating air deal.  I got some nice nasal drainage from Atlanta and now have a bad sore throat as a result, to the point that it's difficult to talk.  That made this weekend tough because my job requires me to talk quite a lot.  Luckily today I didn't have much going on and canceled due to weather.  Allowed me to save my voice a little.  And catch up on some much-needed sleep.  Ah yes, so nice....  Ever notice how comfortable your bed can be sometimes?  You know, obviously you sleep there every night, but you don't always pay attention to how good it feels to lay there.  The exception to this would be my mom.  As long as I can remember, which is a long time, if I was home or within earshot of my mom when she got into bed at night, she would always say to me, " Oh Davey, the bed feels so good doesn't it? " or something to that effect.  Ahhh...memories.    Anyway, I just noticed that the other day when I came home from work frustrated, tired, hot and with a headache.  I stripped down and just fell onto my bed without even pulling back the sheets.  It was the best feeling in the world.  You have to stand back and appreciate things sometimes.  We really have it good.

      For those of you who partook (yes, par TOOK ) in my old livejournal, you may remember reading the post about staplers; the different brands, styles, positives, negatives, etc.    Well, Ellen ( my sister , also known as " -eeg " in the comments section of my blog) read the aformentioned stapler post and commented about the model she used at work and how she was so loyal to that particular stapler.    How loyal was she?  I'll tell you!    When she moved jobs from NYC to San Diego, she requested the SAME stapler again at her new office.  Incredible, I know!  Not many people can claim stapler loyalty like that.  " Get somewhere fast with this, Dave. "  Okay, okay.  So when I was in Atlanta this past weekend, I noticed that, low and behold, behind the front desk at the Red Roof Inn Atlanta Airport North, they had the  urlLink exact same stapler  that Ellen uses.  I'm such a dork that I actually got excited upon seeing it and felt like I had just seen a celebrity.  I'm not joking.  Then I realized how silly a feeling that was but didn't really care anyway since I AM a dork and I accept that.  Exciting, huh?

      Well folks, I wrapped up Phase II of the interview yesterday around 11am and headed back for Dallas.  I actually made the first possible flight back at 1:09pm and it was a DIRECT flight no less.  It's usually really tough to fly standby between Dallas and Atlanta on Delta.  I came through Shreveport, Louisiana on the way over.  Anywho, I think things went fairly well.  I have no idea how it'll turn out but I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  Meanwhile, the instructing continues on.  Does anyone use the new  urlLink Acuvue Advance  contact lenses?  I'm really not liking the ones I have right now.  Actually, I've disliked them since I got them last summer.  Avoid Focus Night & Day's.  Your eyes will hate you.  Anyway, if you happen to use them, please do leave me a comment and tell me what you think.  Now it's time to do some cleaning.  I have a huge stack of receipts that is getting close to spawning life and eating my desk.  That would be bad.  But that is the worst of my problems.  So not too bad, eh?  :-)

      Greetings from Atlanta once again.  I made it through Phase I of the interview, the dreaded  s I m U l A t O r  ride, supposedly the hardest part.  I have to tell ya, flying that big ol' Level D full-motion CRJ simulator at Flight Safety was an awesome experience.  Even if I don't get the job, just getting to do that was incredible.  What I flew looked just like  urlLink this  except it said "Flight Safety" and "CRJ" on the side.  Tomorrow is the HR stuff.  The one-on-one interview, short written test, pee test and fingerprinting for airport security badges/background checks.  After that, I head home to Dallas and wait to hear from them via snail mail.  I shall post the results at a later date.   Flux capacitor..........fluxing.

      The Red Roof Inn is a boring place when you're by yourself. Especially when you're hungry and the only places within SAFE walking distance are McDonald's and a bar. College Park, GA isn't exactly the safest place to be wandering about. Anyway, they've made a few  exciting  changes to the RR since I was here last September.  There's a huge parking lot now in front of the place. Wasn't there before. And they now have two, count 'em, TWO computers in the "business center," one of which I'm typing this on now.  (Obviously)  And now you're updated.   I thought about posting my adventures from yesterday regarding getting to Atlanta from Dallas, but I decided not to. I think it's time to go study some more.

      The Low Wing Airplane vs. The High Wing Airplane  &nbsp;  Today I had a flight with a student in a  urlLink Piper Archer , a 4-seater with the wings mounted low on the fuselage like a typical airliner.&nbsp; Well, this set-up is known for being a little on the warm side due to the oven-baking style compartment the people sit in.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Now, the weather in north Texas right now has reared it's ugly summer head and is showing it's pointy teeth.&nbsp; According to weather.com, McKinney is currently 98 but feels like 104 with 35% humidity.&nbsp; Nice!&nbsp; Oh, and uh, the winds are very light.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  What's my point?&nbsp; I decided to NOT wear an undershirt today for reasons that would take a while to explain.&nbsp; But in doing so, I forgot to put on deodorant.&nbsp; Excellent, Dave...right?&nbsp; To my wonderful surprise, I'm actually quite nice right now.&nbsp; As in, you wouldn't know that I&nbsp;went through all that&nbsp;today.&nbsp; Okay fine, I'll say it.&nbsp; I don't stink like I thought I would.  &nbsp;  Time to go fly again!

      July 19th.  This day will be the day that my life may finally be realized.  Wow, sounds serious doesn't it?  Yeah, so the excitement is I'm finally interviewing for an airline job.  At long last, the day has finally come.  I just hope that all my time and work will pay off.  I'm leaving this Saturday to make sure I get there on time.  Stand-by flying can be an interesting experience.  Right now I'm staring at a  urlLink Learjet 45 , the sexiest business jet on earth.  Yes, airplanes can be sexy.  I think so anyway.  It's parked here at the McKinney, ahem, excuse me, Colin County Regional Airport terminal building.  The pilots are sitting in the lounge across from me.  Looks like an exciting life.  Actually, I'd take it in a second.  Flying a Lear 45.....::thump!::  Plus, it's the business jet featured on Microsoft Flight Simulator.  Check out a  urlLink screen shot  from Microsoft's website.  I'd provide you with my own cool-uh-fied screenshot but I'm not at my apartment.

      It's 11:40ish Texas time...time for bed.  Why?  I have to get up at 4am tomorrow morning to get ready for my 6am departure for Houston on Continental Express, then on to San Francisco to meet the "cruise boat," as Tyler calls it.    I'll get into SF around 10am SF time, then go to the cruise ship terminal near downtown via the  urlLink BART  subway and a short cab ride.  Once I dump my enormous bag at the ship, I've got about 3 hours to kill until my parents arrive from LA and we all get aboard.  So exploring around San Francisco I will go!  Fishermen's Warf is nearby along with other SF landmarks like  urlLink Ghirardelli Square , Lombard Street (the curvy road down a hill), and the Exploritorium.  I'll probably just wander around and take photos.  I'm toting my Canon 35mm and wide-angle 28mm lens.  I wish I could bring my ENTIRE camera bag but it'd be too much to lug.    You're a lug.  Blog atcha when I return on the 22nd of August.  Glacier/general Alaska-esk photos to follow.   urlLink Check out  Crystal's website for live views from the bridge of the  Harmony  during my cruise.  It's supposed to be kinda rainy but who CARES!?!?!

      I added some links to the side of my blog over that way -~-~-~-~-~-> I will likely add some more later when I decide to surf more than just those 5 sites.  I hope to one day make it to the proverbial "end" of the internet!    (I've really been to more than just those 5 sites.  It was just a joke.)

      I think God is trying to tell me that he likes me and wants me to be happy.  First of all, my dad has been planning an Alaska cruise on Crystal Cruises (the company he works for) since my family took a cruise this past Christmas to Mexico.  The Alaska cruise is to include my parents, sister, grandma Greene, and my dad's brother and his wife.  I never thought I'd actually get to go but lo and behold, I leave for San Fransisco on August 10th for the 13-day cruise aboard the Crystal Harmony.  Check out the itinerary  urlLink here .  Most of you know we had an amazing time over Christmas.  Personally, I think a cruise is one of the best vacations you can take, but they're not for everyone.    But wait, there's more.  As if that wasn't enough, the whole "am I going on the cruise or not?" question hung on the outcome of my airline interview.  God said, " Dave, here's what you get.  A  new job  and an awesome cruise with your family as the 'may-be-the-last-chance-to-go-because-your-dad-will-probably- retire-before-you-get-to-go-again'  send-off before going to ground school in Atlanta. "  BTW, God likes to use big long sentences like that.  AND, with less than a week's notice, my current employer where I flight instruct, gave me the 13 DAYS OFF with a smiling face and no complaints.  Now I have to give my students to fellow instructors for the time I'm gone.    Everything is very surreal for me right now.  I feel truly blessed.  My flux capacitor is most definitely fluxing.

      I went to IN-N-OUT Burger's website just now and found out that a rumor I heard while a student at Embry Riddle has actually come true.  They built an IN-N-OUT in Prescott!!!  Go  urlLink here , click on "Locations," then Arizona, then click on Yavapai County which is the county right in the middle of the state with the single white dot in it.  Looks to be right by the mall, which was built while I was living there.  Why didn't they build it to coincide with the opening of the mall?!?!?!  AHhhHhhHhHHhhhh!!!  I'll be crying for a while.  Probably until the next time I post something.

      Okay, so maybe I'm not.  But that'd be such a cool life to live for a while.  He's like this trained machine that can get out of any situation he's put into, no matter who is after him.  Russian henchmen....A Domino's Dot....The Stay-Puffed Marshmallow Man....Whatever.  And he can drive a car better than most, smash it into a bazillion things while suffering from a bullet wound to the shoulder, and still walk away after the car just won't go anymore because it's virtually destroyed from him running into everything that gets in his way.  I think that last sentence may actually be grammatically correct.  Hmmmm.  Anyway, I refuse to believe that it's just special effects and acting.  Matt Damon  really is  Jason Bourne.  He's been fooling all of us since day one.  He can kick butt armed with a rolled-up magazine against a guy with a knife.  He speaks 1000's of languages and carries passports for each country in the world.  And he has time to run on the beaches of India.  If you haven't seen the  Bourne Supremacy  yet, and you liked the  Bourne Identity , I recommend checking it out.  It ties up a lot of things left to mystery in the first.  Like a little about how Bourne got to where he was in the first movie, etc.  And the action/fighting/car chases are quite excellent, if you like that sort of thing.  If you happen to live in the greater DFW area, I recommend heading up to the McKinney Tinseltown because matinee's are only $2.50.  YES, I SAID  $2.50!!!!   And regular times are only $4.50.  Stadium seating!  You can't beat that with a stick!
