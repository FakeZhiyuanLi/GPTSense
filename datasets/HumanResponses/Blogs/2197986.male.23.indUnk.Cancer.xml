      All of these picture were taken in '02.  Some of them aren't the best but it will give a small idea of a few props i have.  urlLink    number 1 is a large cauldron, i mixed up some punch stuff and threw in some dru ice for a great affect.  to bad the dry ice melted the day before so i didn't have enough to make it last all night  urlLink    #2 Marcus the Carcus.  thats what it say on the box.  These things are sold everywhere.  In '02 i used it as shown on the box and made it look like a guy half burried in the ground.  the lights fade on and off which gives a nice erie effect cause you can't always see that it is there.  in '03 i made it peaking over a large piece of plywood,  i personally like that effect better  urlLink    #3 basic light up pumpkins with a withc hat on top, nothing fancy  urlLink    #4 ah the hary rat bought at a store cause who can beat a giant hairy rat?  I thought it was cool  urlLink    lastly, i doubt you can tell but i have some cool wherewolfish contacts.  they have a black outer edge with yellow then the pupil is black in the middle.  very nice even though they didn't come out in the picture too well  urlLink    This is what the contacts are supposed to look like

      Halloween may be no where near but it is on my mind.  The summer is a great time for me to start making new props and thinking of new ways to scare people.  This blog is dedicated to halloween frights!  I will hopefully be posting pictures of the halloween props I make and some of the ones I have that I have put into action around halloween time.

      Ok i've been trying to get pictures of this one up for a while now.  I made this a few nights ago.  basically it was converting a kerosine latern bought at the local surplus store into and electrical lantern.  I took it apart and carved out an area for a light socket and ran the electrical cord down the bottom  urlLink    ah there it is!  for the effect of fire i put a flicker bulb on the inside instead of a regular bulb.  the picture doesn't do it justice but it looks really nice  urlLink    i want to do more cause one in the house wouldn't be enough.  im toying with the idea of making the next one run off batteries.  maybe i'll try it and see which type i like better

      ok so here is my latest creation.  It actually came out pretty messy and i imagine i might be able to do a better job next time although to hide the exposed wires the unit might end up being larger. anyways the idea is you plug one side into the outlet and some prop into the other side.  this way the prop is only activated with motion.  pretty neat. i canabilized a motion detector on som flood lights and bought the female and male plugs to attach to the wires.  Canabilizing an extension cord may have been cheaper!  urlLink
