      OMG it is so hot and humid! Today was this || close to being absolutely horrible, but there was one saving grace, and I'll save that for the end of this post. So, today I realized the full extent of the work I have to do (and should be doing now, but its too fucking HOT to stay focused) and have not done. All of my classes where boring as hell, History was the usual blend of note taking and sitting around with nothing to do, but today it was like a sauna (this is not good). I skipped Chem. to go have lunch with Tegan, which was really fun ;-), this would be the saving grace I mentioned. After finally saying "bye" to her *sigh*, I booked it back to Elmira to make it to class only about 5 min late for Physics. Again it was like a sauna in that class, even with the windows open, and we watched a movie and worked on the project I left at home in my rush to meet Tegan on time. So effectively did nothing. English was the same except the whole class didn't do any work, even Mr. Miessner didn't seem like he wanted to do work so he just let us talk all class. That class was productive, gossip wise, because I found out some interesting things about Chadder's ex. which I found quite funny.  Verdict: day as a whole sucked serious ass, but there where a few good times (thanks Tegan)

      Hey, Well this is my blog, basically I'll just be bitching about what is going on with me and posting non-sence when I'm bored. Occasionally I'll post pics and whatnot for opinions and comments but other than that, there will be nothing of substance here. I'm useing this for two reasons, I'm too lazy to learn how to code to make my website interesting and nice looking, and I like to bitch about stuff and this is a very easy was to get that done. So ya, if you don't know me and you read any further blogs it'll probably be funny, if you know me, well then I guess the level of humor will depend on whether or no I'm bitching about YOU.
