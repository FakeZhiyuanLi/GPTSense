      Brevity isn't one of my strong points, so bear with me if you will.  My parents had always told me I was a intelligent young man, but only until recently did I being to find any truth to their words. I got horrible grades in school, yet looking back at standardized test scores I find that I ranked above the 90th percentile on almost all of them. I was far from a good kid in school, but the main reason for that was the fact that I hated school with a such a passion reserved for dire enemies or intimate lovers. It wasn't that I had been a constant target for bullying (well, perhaps that was part of it), or the fact that got bad grades more than it was the fact that I just did not want to be there. If I was as intelligent as my parents claimed, then shouldn't I have been capable of learning what I had to learn on my own? Shouldn't I be able to make informed decisions on my own? Brief...yes.  To make a long story significantly longer, somewhere around my Freshman year in highschool, my life took a turn for the better (or worse, perhaps). I got involved with the FFA and started making new friends through it, and ultimately it led me to meeting my first girlfriend. It was around that time that I began to realize that I can't just sit around and wait for the world to do what I want it to do. One day I was going to have a wife and a family to take care of, and C's and D's aren't going to get me anywhere. Brief. Well, it didn't last very long. I screwed up, and screwed up more, and just to make matters worse I screwed up some more. She dumped me, I begged her to come back, she slapped me, I cried. Apparently it was because I was TOO sweet and I thought TOO much. Confusion set in, and where confusion often leads to thought, thought would often lead me into depression. My friends began to say that I had become hard since we had broken up, and they began to abandon me. The intelligent guy everyone wanted me to be wasn't so grand after all.  Brief. It was around that time that I first began to open up my eyes to the world. Where I had been raised in a purely Christian family, I begun to become disillusioned with the Christian faith(probably because my ex-girlfriend was pagan), so I begun to study new religions. One point in my Sophomore year, I developed an interest in politics. In the summer before my Junior year I traveled to France and Italy (where I broke my foot in Pisa and came home in a stretch limo half-drunk from wine received in first-class, but that's a whole other story) and in my Junior year, I got what I wanted. I got out of the public school system and became officially homeschooled. I got to decide what I learned, and to tell you the truth, I learned more in one year of homeschool than I did in 11 years of public school. I'm now a senior, set to graduate in January, and I really couldn't be any more happy than I am now.  Anyway, there's a  brief  autobiography for you. If you want a something more in depth I suggest you go microwave some popcorn and pull up a bean-bag chair, cause it could take a while to cover everything that goes through this head of mind.  More at a better hour...
