      Today was graduation day for our kindergartens, and I'm feeling so proud of them!  Each of them, in their cap and gown, received their little diploma, bouquet of flowers, and some said a little thank you speech in Korean to their families and teachers - how sweet!  Awww shucks, my kids are all growing up...  *sniff sniff* :-)  It's amazing how attached I'm becoming to some of these kids already.  Kindergartens are still very much at an 'innocent stage' in their lives, when all they know is play time and games, and all seem to give out love so unconditionally.  As frustrating as they can be to teach sometimes, they're still adorable.  I must admit that I really do love walking into class every morning and having several of them run up and give me a big hug.    And hey the big surprise today was that there was no singing involved!  I don't know if either plans changed or maybe I just never understood them in the first place, but there was no rendition of "My Love" from the elementaries!  I was relieved at not having to try and sing that song in front of everybody, and plus I really have heard it enough times for a lifetime or two already..    And once again, it was 'photo shoot' time again after the formalities, as all the parents wanted to have me in a photo of their kid.  I'm getting used to this 'popularity avec the cameras' thing and must admit that I kinda enjoy it...  I was a big hit with all the Moms today, but that should come as no surprise.  I've always been "in with the Moms" of all my friends my whole life.  I remember having a conversation with Karen and Ellen in the Red River Road Seattle Coffee House about this about two years ago, and today I was having flashbacks back to that chat.  The Moms can be quite flirty with me which is kinda fun yet also a little uncomfortable for me.  One of my favourite pupils is this kid named Steven, and his Mom thought I was the greatest thing since kimchee.  She kept touching me and saying stuff like "Ooohhh, Scott is hot!" in her thick Korean accent.  I wanted to play it up, but with little Steven there watching the whole thing, so I thought it was best to behave myself.  (Note to self: must inform Fountains of Wayne that it's actually Steven's Mom that's got it going on, and not Stacie's!)  After graduation Steven took all of us teachers out for dinner to a nearby Japanese restaurant.  I was a little nervous when he mentioned the restaurant choice, as Japanese is a type of food that I can only handle on certain days - I really gotta be in the mood for it most times.  But hey it's a free meal and it's bonding time with all us teachers, so I wasn't gonna turn it down.  IF ONLY I HAD KNOWN WHAT I WAS GETTING MYSELF INTO!!!  Wow!!!  I was expecting a little sushi, a little California rolls, a little chicken teriyaki, a little miso soup and rice....NOPE!!!!!    We were proceeded to be served course after course after course of some really exotic Japanese food that I have never seen before in my life, most of which were some unknown sea creature.  Plates full of fish (and I mean the *whole* fish) and squid and crab heads and and clams and squishy eel-things (some not much bigger than your finger, some as long as your arm!) and octopus and shrimp-like things and a million other creatures that I had never seen before.  And they were all either barely cooked or RAW!!!  It was like being served for lunch the entire Vancouver Aquarium!  Now as you know, seafood and I don't really get along all that much, especially when it's STILL ALIVE!!!  (I'll get to that part in a moment...)  I really wanted to be brave and try a bit of everything, but just looking at these things made my stomach do loop-de-loops.  I can handle cooked fish and maybe a bit of shrimp, but that's about all I've ever been able to eat in the seafood department.  I'm just not very adventurous when it comes to food, and I feel really guilty about it.  My plan was to come to Korea and experience "all that was Korean" but I just can't get over this food thing.  As you know I've been phasing meat out of my diet for quite some time now, and I think just looking at all this seafood fastforwarded me in the direction of vegetarian a couple more notches.  Steven noticed that I wasn't really eating all that much (the only vegetables on the table was corn and some seaweed thing, which I was eagerly hoarding for myself) and attempted to tempt me with a giant clam about as big as his hand - "It's yummy Scott!  Look...it's still alive!"  He poked the clam with his chopstick...and it moved...  I instantly became light-headed and lost any and all of my appetite!  Again, I feel guilty for being so fussy this way, but it just seems like it's something that I can't get past - my queasy stomach won't allow it!    I spent the rest of the meal watching in awe as my coworkers wolfed down the delectable sea treats while I picked at my corn.  More and more plates of exotic food kept coming - the eggs of some bird that I had never heard of, a little plate of roasted silkworm larvae, jellyfish tentacles, flourescent yellow and pink fish eggs....  All of this was topped off when the table was brought a plate full of a fairly large octopus, all chopped up, but still alive AND SQUIRMING AROUND THE PLATE!!!!  (yes, just like you saw on The Amazing Race!)  It's main body was still pulsating and writhing while severed tentacles wiggled left and right - it was an effort just to keep the creature on the plate.  I watched Steven as he picked up each tentacle and slurped it down, watching the thing still wiggle while in his mouth.  And then he ate the body, and I swear I heard the octopus cry out one last time in its desperate fight for life as it went down his throat....   At this point, seriously, I just about lost it.  I was feeling light-headed, the room was beginning to spin, and it took all I had to keep myself from gagging.  I know I must sound like such as wuss, but you had to see it to believe it!  After lunch we went out for ice cream for dessert (yes! something my wimpy stomach can handle!) and then home for a rest.  I had plans for a night out on the town with a friend in Itaewon, and had to clean myself up/recover from the lunch time spectacle before heading out.  I took the subway into Seoul and met up with another new friend of mine - Charles.  (yes, a different Charles from the Kolon-Mart/night out at Bucheon one you're familiar with.)  Charles is actually my first friend who's not an English Teacher.  He's an American from Colorado and is in the airforce down in a city about an hour south of Seoul called Osan.  He's well familiar with the Itaewon night club scene so he was gonna be my guide for the evening.  My first night out in Seoul proved to be a blast, but very exhausting!!!    The problem with Seoul is it has a great transit system, but it stops running very early!  The last trains leave downtown around 11:30pm, right when the bars are starting to get going...  So you have either one of two options - you can go out to the bar, but have your night cut extremely short by leaving at 11pm or so, or you can party Seoul-style.  And this means partying ALL NIGHT - until the morning trains begin running the next day at 5:30am!  Guess which choice I opted for???  Seoul-style, of course!  I tried to keep up with the Koreans, but I just don't have the energy!!!  We went to 2 lounges for pre-drinks, and then 2 night clubs - all of which were fun but much smaller than what I had imagined.  For being a city of such massive size, the bars here are not very big (but they make up for it in quantity!)  One could go to a different bar/club every night in this city and never go to the same place twice!    Cover at Seoul clubs are pretty reasonable too - the first one we went to costed 10,000 won (about $12 CDN) and the second one 15,000 (about $18 CDN) but cover charge included coat check and 2 free drinks! I ended up running into Michael at one of the bars (the guy I hung out with around the city last weekend) and got to meet a lot of Charles' friends as well.  Plenty of drinks, plenty of dancing, and lots of new friends - A GREAT NIGHT!!!  But then 3am came and I started to crash....  There was no way I was gonna last another 2.5 hours to catch that morning train home...  Fortunately Charles had planned ahead better than I had, and had reserved himself a room at a nearby hotel so that he could crash whenever he felt like it.  He was getting really tired too so we left the bars and he let me crash in his room - oh how wonderful sleep felt!!!  Oh yeah, forgot to mention one important thing.  It was a great night out on the town in Seoul, except for just one thing - we had our jackets stolen!!!  The line-up for coat check at the last club we went to was just way too long, so we decided to hold onto our coats for the night.  This was fine for a while, but then eventually we got tired of holding onto them.  We stuffed them under a seat near where we were dancing, stupidly assuming that they'd be safe and sound.  BOY THAT WAS A DUMB MOVE!!!!  When we went to retrieve our coats later, they were nowhere to be found!!!  I was pretty pissed off at myself for allowing something so avoidable to happen...  It's not so much the coat that I'm upset about (I have others, and this one was getting really old and ripped and I've been browsing for a new one anyways,) but still, it was *my* coat and now someone else out there is wearing it...  If I happen to be walking down the street one day and see the bastard who stole it wearing it, man is he in for an awful surprise!!!

      Every day in class this week, the elementary students have been learning the words to a Westlife song, entitled "My Love."  When I first heard that this was going to be our fun way of helping the kids practice their English, I thought "great idea!"  What could be more fun than learning the words to a good ol' fashioned cheesey pop song and then watching the video?  Well this was a blast at first, but it became really old, REALLY FAST.  We play (and sing along to) the song *at least* three times in each class.  You multiple this by three classes a day, times five days this week...you can do the math pretty quickly and see that I've sung "My Love" WAY TOO MANY times this week!!!  It's an okay song, but now it's started to seep into my 'outside of school' life...I find myself singing it in the shower, while making dinner, while walking home...  I CAN'T ESCAPE!!!!  At first I thought that we were doing this tortuous, errrr.....fun exercise just for the hell of it, but I learned yesterday that there's a method to the madness...  Turns out that all the elementary school kids are going to be doing a real live performance of "My Love" in front of all the parents for the kindergartens' graduation tomorrow!  I'm hoping that I don't have to sing with them (I have an absolutely terrible singing voice, which is a shame cause it looks like I could be in a boy band...haha!)  Most likely I will have to though, being the token celebrity foreigner and all, I'm sure that they'll want me up there...  I'm so nervous!  :-)  I received my first piece of mail today, and I was so excited!!!  It was from my friend Arion, who lives near Seattle.  I was honestly really surprised to see that the package had arrived safe and sound, and had somehow made its way to me.  The Korean postal system seems so crazy I have no idea how it functions...  Most streets don't have names (unless they're major ones) and the addresses of houses and buildings are completely chaotic.  House #6 could be next to #38 next to #629 next to #103.  Apparently they're numbered based on a system of *when* they were built, not in any kind of numerical order!  And supposedly that in order to be a mailman here you have to train and have lived in a neighbourhood for years, because you literally have to have every single address in your area memorized!  WOW!!  I have a new respect for postal workers now!  Anyways, it was awesome to get a package from a familiar name back home (he sent me a newspaper and a Lonely Planet book!) and it totally made my day!  THANKS ARION!!!!  YOU ROCK!!!!  On my way to the grocery store tonight I came across a very upsetting scene...  I saw a man walking down the street near my home with his dog...but the dog was pulling (against his will) this large tire attached to him by a chain.  The dog was completely exhausted and looked weak and poorly fed.  He also looked to be in extreme pain, and I felt so bad for the dog.  The most disgusting thing about this all is that this is *not* the first time I've seen this man forcing his dog to drag heavy objects down the street!  God knows how many times this horrible man has made his dog do this...  Now, as a foreigner, I know there's going to be a lot of things that I see here in Korea that I don't agree with, and so I've tried all along to not be judgemental and keep an open mind, but with this I just can't.  I think it's cruel and disgusting and I was really upset by seeing it.  I wanted to just yell and scream at this man, but yelling out in English would do absolutely no good as I'm sure he doesn't speak it.  I almost feel like sneaking into his house and stealing his dog and letting him free, but the last thing I need is the Korean police on  my tail.  I'm just so frustrated with having witnessed the whole thing, and feeling powerless to do anything about it...  On a lighter note, for the first time ever, I found butter at the grocery store tonight!  I haven't seen butter ANYWHERE here yet until tonight, and I'm really excited to break it out tomorrow for breakfast!!  haha!  Yes, the simplest things in life do give the most pleasure...haha!  I've got such high expectations for this butter though, being that I've been deprived from it for so long, let's hope it measures up!  :-)

      My boss Steven informed me with some great news today - there would be no kindergarten classes for me to teach on Friday!  A whole morning off?  WOW!  :-)  Our kindergartens are graduating this weekend and I guess on Friday morning is rehearsal time or something like that.  He politely declined when I offered to help out, so this means that I get to sleep in tomorrow!!!  YAH!!!    It also means that I could stay up late tonight if I wanted to, so why not take advantage of that?  I decided that a special treat for myself was in order, and that would mean an evening out in Itaewon!  As soon as the bells rang at 6pm I was outta that school so fast...  I raced home, changed into something warm (cause it's been so god-damn cold lately!!!) and headed to catch the bus.  I bought myself some lovely Roots winter wear before leaving Canada, and so tonight I was decked out in my warm and fuzzy Roots "Canada" touque and scarf - looking quite cutely Canadian if I do say so myself!  On the way to the bus, I passed someone I had never seen before....A FEMALE CAUCASIAN!!!  In the whole time I've been living and hanging out in Shihung City/Bucheon, I've never once seen a white female.  All the people that I've met and seen so far have been males - which I find highly unusual!  Before leaving I was given the impression that the majority of English teachers in Korea were girls, so why hadn't I ever seen or met any?  *Where are all the white chick teachers?*  Well right there before my eyes was one, but before I had the chance to overcome my shock and say hello, she had walked (more like motored) right past me, and disappeared into the darkness as quickly and mysteriously as she had arrived...  I think between the darkness and my disguise under the touque she hadn't really noticed me...surely if she had she would've at least said hello or made eye contact?  Us Caucasians are few and far between out in these parts so it seems everyone does their best to make connections whenever they do come across one...  Ahhh well, maybe our paths will cross again soon.  So I've been experimenting with new bus routes, convinced that there's a faster way to/home from the subway station.  I hopped on the #31 that I had taken the other night with Hye-Young and whizzed right along to the subway.  I have to take 3 trains to get to Itaewon, no matter what combination of lines I choose, so I decided to stick with Line 1 as far as I could which would lead me right to Seoul Station (Seoul's version of Grand Central.)  The ride was amazing!  Line 1 is the only one that is above or at surface level (as opposed to being underground) so you get a bit of a view of the city as you ride along.  I had my discman with me and I felt so confident and so happy and so free to be on this train, popstars serenading me all the way along...  The train crossed with enormous Han River into downtown and it was beautiful....all the bridges crossing the river filled with the lights of trains and traffic, and the glow of skyscrapers sparkling in the waters...a magical view indeed.    Two more trains later and I was walking out into the streets of Itaewon.  I stepped out into the street and looked up....there, rising high into the sky and overlooking all of Seoul, was Seoul Tower, lit up like a torch atop Namsan Hill.  It was so beautiful!  I walked down the street, never losing sight of the magnificent glowing tower.  The tree-lined street curved down into Itaewon, and I followed the crowd, while Pink's "God Is A DJ" blasted in my ears (my current fave song!)  I near expected everyone on the street to suddenly break out into some elaborately choreographed dance routine, with pyrotechnics exploding out of the street, and fireworks to explode out over Seoul Tower.  I know that sounds horribly cheesy, but it was *that* surreal and magical of a moment for me.  I felt completely free in the world, like I had life by the reins and was living out my destiny.  I was in such great spirits!!!  (I was also absolutely starving!)  I had remembered seeing a Subway here the other day with Michael, and since I've been craving for a big giant sandwich, I made a b-line for it.  Mmmmmm....it was the best subway sandwich I think I've ever had!!!  After dinner I walked around the neighbourhood, taking in all that Itaewon has to offer.  Again, the mix of Caucasians and Koreans was fascinating, yet rather disorienting at the same time.  I felt the urge to run up to each and every foreigner and hug them and introduce myself, being like "Isn't Korea great!  Let's all be friends!" but I don't think that would go over very well.  Alas, I had to keep my excitement contained to my own thoughts.  Itaewon has lots of cool stores, and I think it would be fun to come here and do a little shopping on my next payday.  There were also tons of bars and clubs all over the place, with loads and loads of military personnel crawling all over the streets.  The mix of American camouflage with 'everyday Koreans' was interesting to look at anyways.  I went and had a caramel macchiatto at this cool coffee house called "Hello Beans", and it was nice to just sit and relax for a bit.  I'm currently reading, for the second time, The Alchemist, and this book gives me great strength and faith in life during this tumultous period in my life.  I could write a whole essay about how amazing and incredible The Alchemist is, but I'll save that for another entry...  After my CM (the first really good coffee I've had here in Korea, by the way) it was time to head home.  Back on the train, back to the burbs...    I took a different combination of lines on the way home, and all this was again fun and relaxing, until I got to Line 1.  THE TRAIN WAS ABSOLUTELY PACKED!!!  But it was 10:30pm at night!  Why would the train be so crowded at such an odd hour?  Surely rush hour traffic out of the city would have come and gone ages ago by now?  Was there some special event in the city that I wasn't aware of?  Did a stadium just empty out or something???  It came as a surprise anyways.  So I squeezed into the train, and it wasn't so bad at first, but then at each station more and more people pushed their way onto the already packed train.  I was right in the middle of the car, and could not move at all!!!  It was SO CROWDED that their honestly wasn't an inch of room between any of the passengers, so every time the car rocked back and forth, everybody moved together as one giant mass.  All you could do was just stand up and sway along with the flow...  It wasn't long before it became like an oven in that train, and poor lil me with my touque and scarf and mits, quickly became desperately overheated.  And I couldn't take off my winter gear because I couldn't move!!!  By the time my station came, which seemed like an eternity later, I was SO HAPPY to be out in the cold winter air.  It seemed to take a lot longer to get home than it did to get into the city, so I was quite tired by the time I got back to my little apartment in Shihung.  While walking home from the bus it started to snow!!!  (the first time I've seen any of the white stuff here in Korea.)  Maybe we'll get a blizzard and we'll have to close the school tomorrow?  God I haven't had a "snow day" in ages - that would be such a blast!  Here's hoping...

      I've decided that to provide some balance for my diary entries, I'd do up a small list of all the things that I find really difficult here in Korea, or just the things that happen to be stressing me out at the moment!  You've heard all the rosy wonderful things so far, now it's time for the other side of the coin....  Enjoy!  1) Loneliness/Isolation - This would definitely be my number one stresser-outer!  Being a foreigner is a great experience, and one I really do reccommend to everyone to try first-hand at some point in their lives, but it's also very lonely at times.  There are days/times when I miss my friends and family back home soooo much!  I live in a part of town where there's not many other foreigners, or anyone who speaks English really, so it's been really difficult to make friends.  I'm used to having a very busy social calendar and not spending so much time at home.  Hell, just ask any of my Vancouver friends - while living there I had a social life that could rival that of any Hollywood socialite!!!  :-)  Now I have sooooo much "alone time" and it's just something that I'm not used to.  It's been a good learning lesson for me, and has made me a stronger person, but it has not been easy.  I'm very much a social creature by nature and need to feel connected, and these days I feel a little lost and alone at times....  2)  Language Barrier - Unlike other foreign countries I've been to (they were all in Europe), English is not spoken very much in Korea.  Also, the Koreans have their own alphabet, so unless you're familiar with it (fairly easy to learn I've been told) you can't even 'sound out' words or signs or anything like that.  I guess this one ties in with the first point I made, but there's some days when I'm just DYING to have a conversation with a native English speaker!!!  The very limited conversations that I have with my kids or boss just do not do enough to stimulate me, and hence the reason why I'm so eager to make new friends.  And plus it makes every single day-to-day task that much more difficult - ordering in a restaurant, buying food at the grocery store, asking directions or finding out how things work......all in involve speaking to another person, and therein lies the language barrier!  But I'm the foreigner here, not them, so it's my responsibility to learn Korean so that I can communicate with them, not the other way around!  I've picked up a few words here and there, but have a lot more yet to learn.  3)  Food - My diet here in Korea has not been the greatest!  Familiar foods are hard to find, if not impossible, so my diet has been very un-Atkins friendly!!!  (all carbs baby!!!  cereal, pasta, bread...those are my staples...LOL!)  The bit of Korean food I've tried has been tasty, but there's a lot of stuff here, mainly in the strange seafood category, that I know would not go down very well...  Probably as time goes on I'll become a lot more accustomed to the dietary change.  Still, there's so many things I'm DYING for - like chicken parmesan, or a grilled salmon fillet, or a giant mother-fuckin sandwich, or tacos, or caesar salad, or ANYTHING WITH CHEESE....the list goes on....  And I'd give my left nut for a Delany's mocha or soy chai right about now!!!  haha!!!  All these are things that I'm sure will taste *ABSOLUTELY AMAZING* and *BREATHTAKINGLY DELICIOUS* the next time I get a chance to enjoy them!  4)  Distance - This also ties in with #1, but the fact that I live way out in the 'burbs is very frustrating.  Shihung City is a pretty cool place, but it's still really quiet, and because is under a lot of development (new towns being built, etc.) it still feels a bit...incomplete...like living in a half-finished city or something.  If it was right on a subway station or closer to the central city it wouldn't be so bad....  Any time I want to go and visit the central city, where the bulk of the entertainment and sights (as well as foreigners) are, it involves a 1.5 hour trip.  This is a normal part of life for Koreans here (the big commute) but I'm still getting used to it.  The trains and buses also stop running around midnight so it's something I have to take into consideration when I'm out at night.  At least taxis are cheap and easy to find!  5)  Smells - This one is pretty minor actually, but one I'm still adjusting to.  I have a fairly weak stomach for certain smells/foods/sights (this is a quality that I *definitely* inherited from my mother - if you don't believe me just sit back and watch the performance that occurs whenever she watches "Fear Factor"!!!)  The smells here are ones that I'm not used to at all, and for the most part that's a great thing cause it adds to the 'newness' of being here, but the smell of raw seafood/squid/other gross squishy sea things in the market can be, at times, enough to make me almost gag!  Let's just say that I've become really good at 'breathing through my mouth' whenever I'm in the market!    So that's my list of things that, at the moment, are all rather stressful or unpleasant or make my life difficult.  It's important for me to emphasize though that they are all things that *I* need to adjust to.  They're not going to change, and I don't expect them to.  Like I mentioned before, I am the foreigner here and it is me that has to get used to certain things.  But it is these 'temporary unpleasantries' that make life here challenging and exciting.  If it was all so easy it would be rather boring, I think.  Eventually, in time, all of these things will be conquered, and I can look back and laugh at how much stress they caused me, and be proud because I was able to overcome them.  All in due time I guess, one day at at time...

      One of the many great things about being a foreign teacher is the opportunity to teach the kids many fun games that they have never been exposed to, yet are omnipresent in North America.  In the last week or so I've had a blast introducing my kids to hangman, musical chairs, "Simon Says", and their new recent favourite - the High Five Game.  (You know the one - "Gimme five, up high, down low, TOO SLOW!")  They absolutely love that one and would honestly play it with me for hours if I let them (more like if I had the energy!)  Today I introduced them to a new game that I stole from the movie Liar Liar.  There's a scene in that movie (at least I think it's that one, could be another Jim Carrey movie) where Jim Carrey chases his son around the room with THE CLAW.  "THE CLAW" is merely his own hand in a grotesque claw-like position, pretending that it is alive and evil, and wanting to eat his son.  I brought out THE CLAW to the kids today and they went crazy - they loved it!  I made sure to do this after school hours knowing that it was going to cause a lot of excitement.  I chased them around the school, and into the play room where we turned off all the lights.  They absolutely loved being chased and screamed at (imagine a mangled scream, and that's what THE CLAW sounds like!) and even the older 12 and 14-year old students couldn't resist joining in.  I think that play time is important with the kids, so that they can see there's more to me than just great English, and it's good for teacher-student bonding!  :-)  After a good hour of THE CLAW I had worked up quite the appetite!  One of the part-time teachers who tutors the kids with their math and science skills invited me out for dinner after work, and it was my first "real Korean" meal since I've arrived!  We went to this Korean restaurant near Bucheon Station and it was quite the experience!  Once again, we had to remove our shoes, and sat cross-legged at small table that's barely higher than the floor.  In the middle of the table is a large grill used to cook our meal, and we were brought a large plate full of several ingredients for dinner.  She ordered some sort of chicken stir-fry like meal and it was very tasty.  Accompanying the main course were several small side dishes, including a bowl of sprouts and Thousand Island dressing (Koreans are all about Thousand Island), a bowl of pickled radishes, a small plate with seasoning, spicy sauce, and the ever-present kimchee (pickled vegetables - not for the faint of heart).  There was also a side of large lettuce leaves so that we could build lettuce wraps with the chicken and steamed vegetables.  The dinner was delicious actually, but so spicy!!!  And we're not just talking "I'll have the hot sauce from Taco Time spicy", this is "take a deep breath, hold on tight boy, and pray you don't shit your pants holy fuck is this ever spicy, SPICY!!!"  I've eaten a lot of spicy food in Vancouver before, but this was the spiciest dish I've had in recent memory.  Maybe I've just been out of practice for a while...  Either way I went through several glasses of water, while Hye-Young barely touched her glass!    The dinner is also supposed to be eaten with chopsticks, an art that I have yet to master.  (Korean cutlery includes only chopsticks and a spoon - nothing else.)  I attempted, rather pathetically I must admit, to eat my dinner with chopsticks but was getting more on the table and all over myself rather than in my mouth, so I just stuck with the spoon!  After the chicken and vegetables dish the same grill was used to cook a feast of rice, vegetables, seaweed, and some other spicy seasonings.  This was a spicy dish as well, but much easier to handle than the first one.  The meal was healthy and delicious and will certainly make my immune system stronger!!!  After dinner we went out for hot chocolate at a nearby coffee joint and sat and relaxed while chatting.  Hye-Young's English is fairly basic, but she's really friendly and likes to ask a lot of questions.  Koreans are very inquisitive, and will ask you unabashedly questions regarding your height and weight, marital status, economic background, and personal sentiments regarding love and romance.  This is not done in a nosy or invasion-of-privacy way, but rather in just wanting to get to know you, and also in order to establish where you lie in the 'social hierarchy' chain.  Koreans place a lot of value on the above questions to determine the proper and most polite way to speak to you - it's all part of their tradition and relates back to their Confucian history - one that is based on respect towards elders and those in certain professions.  It's all very interesting for me because in Western culture these are all questions that one would not normally ask a stranger, or someone that they don't know very well.  Here it's a different story though.  Many Westerners unfamiliar with this part of their culture become offended when asked such personal questions, but lucky for me I've done my research, and had been given a good 'heads-up' by others before arriving here.  It all makes for another interesting night out on the town in Korea.

      There was nothing particularly exciting or eventful going on today (perhaps the first day like it since I've arrived?) but there's plenty of interesting things to comment on about everyday life here in Korea.  The following is a list of random things that I am now accustomed to seeing or experiencing on a daily basis here in Seoul.  Enjoy!  1) Crazy Motorcyclists!  One thing that I was quick to notice here, was how "drivers" (and I use that term loosely) take their motorcycle/scooter absolutely anywhere they damn well feel like it.  This includes on the road but in the opposite lanes, on the sidewalk, and through "pedestrian-only" alleys and markets.  It's not uncommon for me to have to dodge a motorcycle in the crowded market on my way to work everyday!  How they don't end up wiping out, or taking out half a dozen market stands or shoppers, is beyond me!  2) English Music At Random Moments!  Because it's not very often that I hear English/Western music, whenever I do it causes me to stop in my tracks and take a moment to enjoy/laugh at the song.  It always comes when I least expect it, and from unusual places, like gas stations, on the bus, or in that one not-unlike-Gap store next to my school in the market.  Beyonce, Justin Timberlake, the Bangles, Cindi Lauper, Nickelback, Norah Jones, Michael Buble, Avril Lavigne and especially Britney Spears are all artists that I've heard in public in the last week or so.  I've heard Britney at least three or four times, more than any other Western singer - perhaps Britney is the official Ambassador to Korea?  3) Squid!  Koreans are "all about the squid!"  They love the stuff, and it can be bought and consumed anywhere.  Every market I've been to is full of them, and so is every restaurant I've visited.  I've been walking down the street and had trucks drive by full of squid with loudspeakers blaring (what I'm assuming they're saying in Korean about how fresh and yummy their squid is.)  Dried squid is a popular snack here, and is eaten just like how North Americans eat potato chips.  Personally I'm not a fan of the stuff, but hey maybe by the end of the year I'll be poppin' squid like Liza Manelli pops pills?  4) Slippers!  In Korea it is considered very rude to wear shoes, of any kind, inside a building.  This applies to homes, restaurants, and offices.  Instead, you must leave your shoes at the door, and wear slippers inside (which are provided by wherever you are.)  So everyday I walk to work in my nice classy black dress shoes, leave them at the door when I get to school, and put on a pair of worn, thin, blue or pink or whatever-colour-is-around slippers (the kind your grandma probably wears...)  Yes, that means I'm teaching grammar and vocabularly to my students...in slippers.  It still makes me giggle too...  5) Virtual Celebrity Status!  Every single day, no matter where I go, no matter what time of day it is, I am looked, or should I say, stared at in amazement/confusion/wonder/curiousity by Koreans.  Foreigners are still not a common sight in many areas in Korea, including the suburb I live in (where I know of a total of 3 foreigners that live in a pop. 300,000 city!)  and so they attract a lot of attention.  You get used to it after a while, but every once in a while I 'trip out' over it, or forget that I'm a 'local celebrity' and feel confused why people are looking at me, and then I remember where I am - Korea!  Most of the time all this is rather amusing, but sometimes you just don't want to be looked at, or want to feel 'anonymous.'  When you stand out so much (especially being 6'3", blond-haired, and blue-eyed) it's like you just can't have an "off day."  You are always "on stage", always "in performance mode" because there's always eyes on you.  Koreans are always yelling "hello" or "hi" to you on the street or in the stores, just to practice their English or just to get you to look at them.  'And total strangers will even take pictures of you on the street or on the train or wherever...  It's definitely *not* something that I've ever experienced before.  Sometimes I have a little fun with it though, and see what I can get away with...  The other day while walking to the bus I happened to pass this church, where about 6 or 7 teenage girls were standing outside together.  I was on the other side of the street, but when they saw me they got rather excited and started yelling out "Hello!"  and "Nice To Meet You!" and "How Are You?" to me.  I turned, smiled, and gave them a big wave.  This got them even more hyped up and they started giggling and laughing and making even more noise.  Then they yelled back "Hello Handsome Boy!" out to me.  Well then I decided, just for fun, that I'd 'kick it up a notch'...    I blew them a kiss...    OH MY GOD!!!!  They went absolutely hysterical!!!  They started jumping up and down, waving their hands and arms around uncontrollably, and SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF THEIR LUNGS!!!  I honestly thought they were going to start to cry, they were so excited!!!  Wow - this must be what it feels like to be Justin Timberlake or something!  With attention like this I feel like I should be some super-famous pop star or movie actor, but I'm not!  I'm just some white dude who's an English teacher in suburban Korea!  It made me laugh, and the Leo in me did enjoy the little ego-boost.  I wish I had moments like this on video to show you cause honestly you wouldn't believe it unless you saw it!  *GOTTA LOVE LIFE IN KOREA, EH!*

      Today was an awesome day!  It was my first time visiting central Seoul, and actually was a day full of 'firsts.'  I had made plans with my new friend Michael to hang out in the city, but in order to meet up with him, I had to take my first subway ride.  I rode the 015 bus to Bucheon Station (where I had partied the other night) and before catching the bus attempted to make a phone call to Michael to let him know I was getting on the train...  It proved to be much more difficult than I had thought it would be!  I've never made a local phone call before, and was under the impression that all one had to do was drop in a 100 coin and dial....  Well I tried this, but instead had some pre-recorded Korean man sing me a song, three times, then a long pause, then some other pre-recorded message by an operator lady, and then a horrible screeching sound!  What the fuck?  I thought maybe it didn't work because I was so far out in the burbs, and decided to try again later once I got in the city.  I had to take two trains to get to where Michael lives, and it turned out to be really easy!  Seoul's subway system is not only colour-coded, but also has all its signs in English as well as Korean, so navigating it is a breeze.  Riding a giant underground subway has as a very 'metropolitan feel' to it...much different than riding Vancouver's SkyTrain, which feels more like a Disney ride to me.  Michael lives on the other side of Seoul from me, so it took almost a full hour on the train just to get to his part of town!!  When I got off the train I attempted to phone him again, and had the same problems!!!  What was I doing wrong?  Eventually I had to ask some Korean guy, using only gestures, to show me how to work the damn phone.  And what did he do?  Just dropped in the coin and dialed...and it actually worked!!!  I really don't know what I was doing earlier that messed things up so much...haha!  Michael met me a few minutes later outside the station, and we decided to head on down to Itaewon, which is the foreigners' neighbourhood in Seoul.  Because it was a rather rainy and cold day, he offered to drive - so nice of him!  Michael is a super cool guy - he's 25 and from Minneapolis, and has been in Korea almost a year and a half travelling and teaching English.  He's totally a pro at life in Seoul, and was the best tour guide a guy could ask for.  He not only knew his way around this crazy city, but was full of interesting facts about the different neighbourhoods that we passed through.  We arrived in Itaewon and it was totally weird being there!  It's an equal mix of Korean and English signs, and the streets were crawling with foreigners!!!  Between the mix of Asian and Western people and signs, and the dreary weather, it was just like being back in Vancouver!  Well, not exactly - but awfully close!  We walked around and he showed me tons of cool stuff - where the cool clubs are, what restaurants are good, and also a few stores that sell Western products that you just can't find anywhere else in Seoul!  SO IMFORMATIVE!!  :-)  We had lunch at this restaurant popular with foreigners called Geckos.  Its menu was full of Western food, and the place was packed with American military!  (Yongsan Base, which is a huge American military base, is just nearby.)  We ordered lunch and chatted away, and then realized that we have mutual friends!!!  I was shocked to find out that Michael used to date someone that my ol' Thunder Bay buddy Craig used to date (back when he lived in Minneapolis), and has even been to Craig's house!!!  WOW!!!  What a small world I tell ya!  That whole six degrees of separation thing is so true!!!   Amazing!  :-)  After Itaewon Michael took me to Namdaemun Market - one of Seoul's largest and most popular outdoor markets.  Turns out that this particular Sunday was sort of an 'off day' at the market, as things were much quieter than usual there.  Still, it was great to wander through the many streets and alleys, checking out all the stawls selling anything and everything imaginable.  The market is so big that it was take a whole day to really explore it fully, but it was cool just to have a sample!    After Namdaemun Market, Michael drove us over to COEX Mall - one of, if not the, largest shopping complex in Korea.  The drive there was awesome as it took us right through the heart of Seoul and past many landmarks - museums, memorials, parks, soaring skyscrapers, and busy diverse neighbourhoods.  Seoul is an incredible city - there's so much to explore that it just blows my mind away.  We also went past Seoul Tower which is in Namsan Park - a big mountain right in the middle of the city!  And then across the Han River - the wide, slow-moving river that bisects Seoul.  Highrises filled the horizon no matter where you looked, and crazy-huge super-freeways lined the banks of the river.  Wow!  COEX Mall is massive and extremely busy, and besides containing hundreds of stores, also has 3 food courts, two luxury hotels, a huge conference centre, an aquarium, a nightclub, and a giant movie theatre called MegaBox that holds 17 screens.  And did I mention that it was BUSY!!!???  :-)  We spent a good hour plus just wandering around checking out different stores and the various food courts.  It was a bit overwhelming to be in there, but I guess I better start getting used to all the crowds here in Seoul!!  After that it was some dinner at the food court (chicken curry for me, which also included kimchee, 2 kinds pickled radishes, a bowl of seaweed, and a small serving of tiny baby silver fish!)  Quite the combo!  And all for only 5000 won! (about $6 CDN.)  After dinner it was time for me to head back to the burbs.  I said my goodbyes to Michael, who seems really sincere and genuine, and also has a lot of common interests as me.  I think that we will become really good friends and I look forward to hanging out with him again sometime soon.  The subway home was long but relaxing, except for the part where this disabled guy entered our car...  I have no idea where he came from, but this guy was probably about middle age or so, and didn't have any use of his legs, so he just shuffled along the floor, dragging himself to move from one end to the next.  His legs kept twitching and he smelled absolutely terrible.  He was going from subway car to subway car (including dragging himself inbetween cars while the train was in motion!) to beg for money from other passengers.  It was the saddest sight I've seen yet here in Korea.  He looked so sad and pathetic and near helpless, as he was struggling to move along.  I'm assuming this is what he does all day to make ends meet?  I really don't know...  I was really impressed with the number of passengers, young and old, who gave him money.  I think if I had seen this guy back home the vast majority of people would have just walked over him, or tried to pretend like he wasn't there, but the Koreans around me seemed to be really generous towards the poor man.  A sobering experience nonetheless, and a good reminder of how blessed I am (not only am I lucky enough to be able to experience life in a foreign country, but I have full use of my legs!  Both things that I should never take for granted...)

      This was a fairly non-productive day, for obvious reasons!!!  After getting home so late, I didn't wake up until almost noon today!  (There goes half the day!)  I spent the day just puttering around my apartment, doing some cleaning, and also attempting my first run at laundry, Korean-style.  In my bathroom/shower room, is my washing machine.  Steven had showed me how to use it when I first moved in, but god help me if I can remember how to work the darn thing!  All the buttons are in Korean, so I really have no idea how to work the damn thing.  Anyways I piled in all my dirty unmentionables, and just pushed a bunch of buttons until it started to make a noise that sounded like cleaning.  My machine has this weird display screen, where the laundry cycle counts down its steps from 84 down to 0.  I guess there's exactly 84 steps this machine goes thru to clean my clothes?  (cause it makes a slightly different noise for each step...)  Whatever...  Now drying is a different story!  Notice how I've never mentioned my dryer?  That's cause I don't have one!!!  I don't know if Koreans just don't do dryers at all, or maybe I just don't have one.  Either way Steven had bought me this funny contraption for my apartment to dry my clothes on.  It looks like a giant metal praying mantis/torture device that I'm apparently supposed to use to hang my damp clothes on.  I tried numerous times to set this device up, but I really have no idea how it's supposed to work!  My clothes are hanging on it precariously right now as we speak, but I think that if I look at it the wrong way it'll collapse before my very eyes.    Tonight I was invited to another Park family outing - this time it was Ester's (the youngest daughter) piano recital!  This was a thoroughly enjoyable experience!  The kids are adorable and could all play piano quite well (a few of them were my 5-year old kindergartens that I teach!)  Steven told me that music lessons, especially piano, are very popular here in Korea.  It was fun to check it out anyways.  I was invited over to their house, upstairs from my apartment, for pizza after the recital.  This was my first time having pizza here in Korea, and it was pretty tasty actually, despite containing ingredients that I could not fully identify (including potato - who would've thought that giant slices of potato on pizza would taste so yummy!)  The one thing I really do need to mention is, and this comes as a bit of a sad day for me, is that I believe that I ate...red meat.  I gave up eating red meat entirely 7 months ago, and honestly have not touched a piece of beef or pork since, until tonight...  I can't say for certain, but I'm pretty sure that one of the toppings on the pizzas was pieces of hamburger...  I saw them on the pizza before I ate it, but my Korean family was so excited to have me over for dinner, and were eager for me to "enjoy Korean pizza", that I didn't have the heart to either decline the pizza, or pick off the meat.  They've been so kind and so gracious to me, I just didn't want to appear rude...  And so I ate it.  There!  I said it!  It happened!  Many of my friends predicted that I wouldn't be able to last very long in Korea without eating red meat, and I had been convinced that I could do it, but here I am a week into my trip, and I have cow digesting in me at this very moment...  Ugh...  *I FEEL SO GUILTY!!!*

      (please scroll down to read the beginning of this day)  So after the Vanilla Ice/sausage break, it was back to Halloween!  There were a few more people in it this time, so the three of us pulled up a seat at the bar and ordered some drinks.  Alcohol varies quite a bit in price in Korea, depending what you order and where.  Beer was quite cheap at Halloween, but being the more sophisticated man that I am, I stuck to ordering G&T's.  (Note: All those know me, know that the drink of choice for S2H is the Tom Collins, however, trying to explain that in Korean would just be too much as I doubt they know what it is.  Eventually I hope to meet some Koreans who can translate it for me, or at least write down the ingredients in Korean so I can order it in the future.)  Halloween turned out to be pretty cool.  They played all English music, and you can even request songs by browsing through the 3000-CD library on the wall behind the bar.  After a couple Gin & Tonics, I was in a *really* good mood (price of a G&T = 5000 won, or about $5.75 CDN - the same as what I pay back home for a Tom Collins.)  Charles already had had a good buzz going by the time we got to Bucheon, so he was in the full swing of things after a few drinks at Halloween.  A couple times he made his way to the dance floor, which was empty, and boogied away - occasionally attempting to get the crowd going by pretending to take off his clothes.  (Don't forget Charles used to be a stripper - I guess old habits die hard?)  A foreigner sat down next to us at the bar and I introduced myself.  His name was Chris, and he was a 24-year old American from Chicago teaching English here in Korea.  He seemed like a really cool guy and the four of us had a blast just hanging out drinking and enjoying the music.  After a little while we decided to change venues so went back up to the street, where we met 2 other guys - both of them Korean.  The first guy was James who was Korean-born, Seattle-raised, and now recently-re-Koreanized.  His buddy was from Korea and I was introduced to him a number of times, but alas, those darn G&T's, I forget his name...  We cruised around the strip for a while, drawing much attention wherever we went (we were the only group of foreigners I saw the whole night.)  Plenty of Korean girls, and boys, gave us the eye during the night, and I think Charles tried to hit on each and every one of them!  :-)  James led us to a big club called "Speed", which was a very classy, VERY EXPENSIVE joint.  The 6 of us were led in by men in uniform and sat at a special table, where we were immediately presented with a massive bowl of fruit, a plate of dried squid, and 12 bottles of beer, each of which were opened and poured for us...  Chris and I looked at each other with a look of worried suspicion...as enjoyable as this kind of service was, we knew that it had to come with a pretty steep price tag.  Neither James nor his Korean friend could tell us how much it was all going to cost us, but kept saying "Don't worry man!  It's all cool!"  Hmm...  So one round of beer turned into two, which later turned into three....  One tradition that I absolutely love here in Korea is that you are never supposed to pour your own drink, instead you are responsible for making sure that the glasses of all your friends/guests are never empty, and you take the iniative by pouring for them, making sure that you *always* use two hands to pour, and to receive a drink.  It seems like a very friendly custom, and I love it!    The music at Speed was really good!  It was comprised of about 90% fast songs, and 10% slow songs.  When the fast music is on, everybody in the club, and I do mean EVERYBODY, goes out to dance.  The tables are literally completely empty in the club when the beats are rockin', but then the slow music comes back on and that's your chance to order more drinks, have a rest, take a piss, etc.  The 5 of us (Glenn doesn't dance) spent a good part of the evening on the dance floor and it was a total blast!  The DJ was this really attractive, tiny Korean chick on stage, just spinnin' away, breakin' out on her mic once in a while to get the crowd going.  (to picture it, think of the DJ in Robbie Williams' "Rock DJ" video).  I kept trying to mack on her cause she was all smiles to me, but alas, she refused my gestures to come down and dance with me.  About half way through the evening, something strange started happening whenever we were all sitting back at our table....  The staff of the bar started bringing us...women...to come and sit with us.  I had no idea if these were just other patrons in the bar, or maybe they were bar staff, or perhaps they were...ummm...hostesses???  Turns out they were prostitutes, ready and available for our disposal.  Oh my!!!  Chris and Charles that this was GREAT, and were laying on the charm like you wouldn't believe on these girls, some of whom seemed to really enjoy the attention, and some of whom looked absolutely petrified.  They seemed to just come and go, these girls, and I was happy that their visits didn't turn to more.  Next thing we knew it was 2am and Glenn, Chris and I were starting to crash.  And plus at this point I was getting really worried about what our bill was going to be like.  After all the beer and the food and the women and the special service...I knew it was going to be painful when it arrived...  Two others had joined us at this point too - 2 Chinese guys who Charles met in the bathroom.  The Chinese guys, Chris and I were pretty sure, either 'swang both ways' or were just plain gay, cause even though they claimed they had girlfriends back home, they were ALL OVER CHARLES who seemed to love flirting with them.  Chris gave a few winks to them just to see what would happen, and the one guy practically took Chris right there in the bar!  OH MY!  2am became 2:30 became 3:00, and we were still trying to make our way out of the bar.  Chris, Glenn, and I had each slapped down 20,000 won, claiming that 'that's all we had'.  Something just did not seem right with James and his Korean friend - it seemed like James was doing all the ordering and stuff, and claimed that we didn't need to worry about the bill, yet weren't putting up any cash at all....  Chris and I had this feeling that we were being taken advantage of...  After paying what we guessed our portion was, or should be, the 3 of us left the bar to go get some air and let the others take care of the rest.  In all honesty I just wanted to get out of there - if the bill was something crazy expensive, Chris and I had agreed to just make a break for it.  We waited outside for the others to come out, but they didn't... So we waited and waited and waited...getting more and more worried about what was happening back inside with the bill.  Glenn disappeared inside to go and find out what was going on, promising he'd be right back to let us know what was happening.  He didn't come back...  Finally, after what seemed like an eternity passed, everybody emerged from the bar, a-okay.  Turns out the bill had been disgustingly expensive (I never did hear the final total), but thanks to one of the Chinese guys that Charles had met, who I guess knew the owner of the bar?, it had been bargained down to about $200.  Not bad I guess for a night full of booze, food, women, and a growing table of guests...  I was just relieved that we didn't have the Korean Mafia after us or anything!  haha!  We all said our goodbyes, exchanged phone numbers, and Glenn, Charles, and I caught a taxi back to Shihung.  By the time I got home it was about 4 AM, and I could hear my bed calling my name from blocks away...  I was dead tired, but it was an awesome night, full of new wonderful experiences, and I can't wait to have a million more just like it before the end of the year!  BUCHEON ROCKS!

      Teaching English has been overall quite an enjoyable experience, but I must admit that it's quite draining at the same time.  The kids are adorable, but have so much excess energy to burn it can be hard to keep up with them.  And also, even though I'm only teaching basic English, everything I speak and write out has to be so carefully thought-out.  Will the kids understand what I'm saying?  Are they learning anything new or is this just review for them?  Is this the direction Steven wanted me to take the lesson in?  Am I going too fast?  Too slow?  Steven has been a great director so far, but sometimes the language barrier makes it a bit difficult to understand what he's trying to convey.  We're not always on the same page with things, and I find that he gets really frustrated at times with the kids when they don't understand what he's trying to teach them.  But if *I'm* having a hard time understanding the lesson...the kids must be completely lost!  Either way, it just takes a lot of patience and dedication, and we always seem to figure things out in the end.    So by the time six o'clock came 'round, I was SO READY for the weekend!  I went home, had a quick dinner, and got ready for my first night out on the town in Korea.  I was meeting up with Charles at 9pm in front of Kolon-Mart, and had to be prepared for absolutely anything.  Who knows what direction the night will lead us?    I met up with Charles, and was informed that Glenn, the other Canadian guy who lives in his building, would be joining us that evening.  We marched over to the bus-stop, and I got introduced to Glenn.  Glenn was fairly...interesting as well...  He's 26 (but looks closer to 36) and had a bit of a surly look about him.  He's from Halifax originally but has been teaching English in Korea for almost 2 years now.  I also got a bit of a weird vibe from him too (where are all the "normal" North Americans?) but he seemed nice enough anyways.  We boarded the 015 and rode on over to Bucheon Station - my first bus ride in Korea! The bus costs only 520 won (less than 50 cents Canadian) and like Charles promised, the bus ride to Bucheon was only around 15 minutes or so.    We arrived at Bucheon, rounded the corner, and instantly my jaw the ground...  Bucheon is the closest subway station to me and is located in a MASSIVE office complex.  Just outside the station is a huge roundabout with cars spinning around, surrounded by soaring office towers and dozens of brightly-lit restaurants and stores.  And I couldn't get over how BUSY the area was!!!  The streets were absolutely packed with hundreds of people coming to and fro, all on their way out to hit the nearby clubs and bars.  The street with all the cool clubs is a block over from the station, but before heading there Glenn took us down a dark alley nearby, so that he could show us the nearby 'red-light district.'  Charles was giddy with excitement - he's probably the horniest person I've ever met in my life, and talks non-stop about various kinds of Asian women (he's lived in several countries in Asia) and what they like in the bedroom, what kinds of panties various nationalities prefer to wear, the girls he met when he was a stripper in Taiwan, etc.  Charles talks pretty much non-stop, but at least his energy and enthusiasm are high.  And man does he have some interesting stories...  Glenn is much more shy and quiet, but certainly made it clear he likes his Asian women too, especially young ones...  Anyways....  So we stepped into the red-light alley (which is literally red, due to the buildings' red-coloured exteriors and neon) but it was fairly quiet with virtually no one in the street.  We strolled down the alley, and every doorway we passed had some Asian hooker standing or sitting just inside the doorway, skirt pulled high, blouse cut low, giving each of us bambi eyes and pouty lips, beckoning us inside...  "Oh the ones here tonight are all skanky and nasty, let's move on" declared Charles.  Fine by me!  We headed over the the street with all the clubs, which is *amazing* just to look at and walk through.  It's probably at least 6-8 blocks long and is completely lined with bars, clubs, hoppin' restaurants and street stalls selling all kinds of snacks, ranging from corn dogs to pasta to deep-fried unidentifiable sea things.  And again, the crowds were unbelievable - so busy, so festive, so high-energy.  Music is blaring/screaming/bellowing from giant speakers on each corner - a complete party atmosphere to the extreme!  And with the buildings covered from top to bottom in neon, it's a completely surreal sight.  Like being in some fantasy Asian music video or something...  WOW!!!  Charles led us to a bar called Halloween - the ones that's supposed to be popular with foreigners.  It was near empty when we stepped inside (still a little early in the evening - only around 10pm) so we decided to walk around a little more instead, and Charles wanted to grab a snack.  We found a cafe that serves Western-style sandwiches and I was very excited about this - I've been craving a half-decent sandwich since arriving - now I know where to find one!  After eating his sandwich, Charles was still hungry ("I'm really craving some MEAT, man!  Let's go get me some MEAT!")  We found the stand selling giant sausages, and so Charles ordered three.  While standing there, watching Charles eagerly devour the meat, ketchup and mustard running down his hand and all over his face, something totally cool happened.  The bar across the street started to blast "Ice Ice Baby", only it was sung by some Asian guy with a girl singing the chorus!!  Charles and I instantly broke out into the lyrics, him and I still having the entire song memorized!  Glenn looked at us like we were from Mars, but it was absolutely hilarious to belt it out in the street, and it's a silly random moment that I'll never forget.  More to come later tonight...I must duck out....

      Last night I had a knock at my door, and it was Steven.  He was popping by to invite me along with his family to attend his eldest daughter's graduation ceremony the following morning.  Pass up a chance to not only experience some Korean culture, but also a  car ride ?   I think not!  We left the next morning at 10 AM and drove on over to Bucheon, the city next to Shihung City.  (The nearest subway station of the same name, according to Charles, is somewhere in this area...)    Bucheon is at least twice the size of Shihung City and is typical of a Seoul suburb - busy crowded streets, massive freeways, and towering apartment complexes as far as the eye can see...  And no matter which direction you turn, in the distance you can see other neighbouring suburbs, and other towering apartment complexes dotting the horizon - a full 360 degrees of megacity.  The size of Seoul (and technically I haven't even been to Seoul yet) amazes me each and every day.    Sandy's elementary school was located right smack in the middle of one of these high-rise complexes, and all the parents gathered outside the school, eagerly awaiting for their children to exit.  I had been assuming that we'd be attending an actual 'ceremony' of some sort, but there was nothing of it - perhaps the real ceremony is for the students only?  Either way, it was really nice to just hang outside in the warm sun - today was definitely the warmest day yet since I've arrived.    Since it was a special occasion, I had donned my classic snazzy blue-shirt/yellow-tie suit get-up, and was attracting much attention.  Children ran around me and waved at me, and parents stared curiously from a safe distance.  Vendors nearby were selling cotton candy (something I didn't expect to see in Korea) and flowers, and soon it was time to enter the school to seek out Sandy.  The school inside was a wonderful chaos of proud parents and excited children, all eager to have their picture taken with their respective teachers, extended families, student peers, etc.  Soon we found Sandy and it was our turn to join the festivities.  And that's when it all began...  Sandy's mother, Susan, took a couple photos of her with her diploma and flowers, next to myself and Steven.  And then a few of Sandy's friends ran over and also wanted to have their picture taken with her...and me....  Next thing I knew there was a virtual line-up of parents dying to take a picture of me with their child, each of them absolutely thrilled to have the photo opp with a foreigner.   I must admit that I was enjoying the attention, and showed off my pretty pearlies with my arm around each child, as a good sport would.  But then it started to get a little too crowded and became a bit too chaotic, so Steven suggested we head outside the school to take some private family photos outside.  No sooner had we stepped outside and had only taken ONE family photograph, it all started up again.  I was soon surrounded by a virtual paparazzi of parents with their cameras and videocameras pointing at me.  Instantly I was surrounded by kids who wanted to have their photo taken with me too.  And *then* I was being pulled by the arm by housewives so that I could be in their  family  photos - Sandy wasn't even around at this point!  These were families and children that I had never seen before in my life!  Steven, Susan, and Sandy just stood aside and laughed, enjoying the excitement and watching me get pulled left and right.  I honestly felt like I was a Hollywood celebrity or something!  I think I had more pictures of me taken today than even at my *own* graduation!  After the photo shoot, err.... graduation, we went and had a nice quiet lunch at a McDonald's back in Shihung.  I'm sad to admit that I was actually kinda *excited* to see a McDonald's, and to find out that it's only 15 minutes walk from my house.  The McDonald's is located in a newer area of Shihung City, just a few blocks from the now-infamous Kolon-Mart.  The area that Kolon-Mart and McD's is in what they call a "new town".  It's an entire virtual city built from scratch - a master-planned community on steroids.  Apparently Shihung City has won awards for its town planning in this 'new town' area, and I can see why.  The new town is divided into several block areas or sections, each comprising a 4x4 block radius of stores, restaurants, and services surrounded by a ring of massive high-rise apartment towers.  Right in the middle of the commercial area is a large outdoor public market, where vendors are selling anything and everything - fruit, small kitchen appliances, clothing, baby supplies, stationery, and of course, SHOES!  Mixed in all of this is a well-developed network of trails and bike paths, as well as dozens of parks and playgrounds, and several schools ranging from kindergarten to high school.  These new towns are very high density with thousands of people living in a small area, but the roads are designed to funnel traffic quickly out of the core, and the area is well serviced by transit, so it actually seems to function really well.  It's like walking through a giant version of SimCity come to life!  I wish I had my ol' GSU buddies here to walk through with me and just take it all in.  So much cool urban planning geeky-stuff to talk about here!!!  The afternoon was spent entirely playing games again the play room - all I had to do was sit back and watch, or join in for certain games.  After dinner I decided to go for a loooong walk through the new town area, right where we had lunch earlier.  Once again, the city was a dazzling display of neon lights reaching high into the sky.  This time I brought my camera and snapped a few shots - here's hoping they turn out! I didn't run into any foreigners tonight, crazy or otherwise, but that should change tomorrow...  Charles and I are supposed to go check out a bar near Bucheon Station that's popular with foreigners...should be a very interesting night, regardless of what happens...  Wish me luck, and stay tuned...

      Today was a great day!  I woke up in a wonderful mood and was ready to take on whatever came my way.  For whatever reason I was feeling especially confident and empowered, and decided that I wanted to tackle several missions today.  Just one of those days when you wake up and *know* that it's going to be a good day.    Before I forget, last night while watching TV before bed, I was thrilled to come across some English TV shows - the first I've seen since arriving.  I was channel-surfing when low and behold, I came across CSI!  (and not the lame Miami version, but the kick-ass Las Vegas original one!)  I WAS SO EXCITED!  Who would've guessed that Koreans watch CSI?  Certainly not I!  As my Mom would say, I was 'happier than a pig in a pile of shit!'  :-)  And after that, I got to watch Sabrina The Teenage Witch, and then The Nanny.  Hey, don't laugh!  One will be excited over *any* English programming, regardless of its content, when one is removed from English networks.    School was great today - I'm becoming really comfortable with the kids, and feel much more at ease in front of the classroom.  I feel like I've come a really long way, even in just 3 short days.  The creative juices are flowing, and I'm starting to come up with some cool fun games for the kids to play.  (However, I must confess, that I have 'borrowed'   a few ideas for my games from Cranium's Word Worm category - who knew that a Starbucks board game would prove to be so handy?)    While at home for lunch today I finally got to open and eat that can of beans that I had been dreaming about the other day.  Once again, another setback though...  Turns out that baked beans in Korea are, umm....rather disgusting.  I never realized that baked brown beans could be...crunchy...?  They taste as if they've barely been cooked!  (and yes, I nuked them quite well in the micro...)  hmmm....  Yeah I don't think I'll be buying those again....  While on my one hour afternoon break (yes, I get a lot of breaks at work - 2.5 hours for lunch, and then an hour break in mid-afternoon) I was feeling especially bold and decided to tackle two of my biggest challenges - the two things that have been weighing on my mind the most since arriving - to figure out which bus will take me to the subway, and where I can catch it!  And to figure out the god-damned calling card, so I can phone my parents!  I decided to take care of the whole phone thing first, only this time I wasn't going to let any nasty cunty operator bitch stop me from doing it!  I found a pay phone, dialed in all 2056 numbers needed to connect to Canada...and the phone actually rang....  Turns out it had been my mistake all along (choosing the wrong phone carrier when being given a choice of phone companies...wow I felt dumb!)  So I phoned Mom and Dad at Nana's and it just rang and rang...DAMN!  NO ONE HOME!  So I phoned my sister in Thunder Bay, and listened to it ring and ring...  And so then I tried my Auntie, and once again, it rang and rang and rang...  Was nobody home?  It was quite the let-down after finally figuring out how to do the call, but hey atleast I know how to make a phone call now!  On to my other challenge.  Julia had informed me that the #1 bus goes to Sosa Station, and even though it is a half-hour ride away, is the nearest subway station.  And then it's probably *at least* an hour on the subway to get downtown!  I was quite distressed when I first heard about this!  Turns out that I'm *really* out in the 'burbs.  Looks like Shiheung City is like the Maple Ridge of Seoul!  So much for 'evening jaunts' around Itaewon! (the foreigners' neighbourhood in the central city.)  As forboding as this bus ride is, I thought "to hell with it - if Koreans do it everyday, so can I!"  I did a quick walk around the area and found that, just up the street from my work, is a bus stop with a sign indicating that the #1 stops there!  WOW!  THAT WAS EASY!  I definitely plan on going for that bus ride this coming weekend...    I decided that since I still had time to kill I'd treat myself to a coffee and donut at Dunkin Donuts, the one I saw on my first day of exploration.  I remembered exactly where it was, went in and picked out a tasty snack, and that became not only my first 'meal' ordered at a restaurant by myself, but my first Western treat since arriving.  YAH!  On my way back to work I noticed a very large store called Kolon-Mart.  Assuming that it is *not* a store selling (il)legal body organs, I made a mental note to check it out after work...  Oh what surprises lay in waiting for me there....  The afternoon was spent playing games with the kids in the big play room - no real English lessons that day.  After work I made a b-line for the phone, and tried again to phone my parents.  The phone rang and....someone answered!!!  It was my Uncle Paul, who sounded a little...out of it...  Turns out I had severely mis-calculated the time difference between Seoul and Phoenix, and was phoning at 2:15am their time!!!  OOPS!!!  Either way, I got to speak to my very sleepy Mom for almost a half hour, and it was so wonderful to hear her voice.  Not only was it amazing because it was a real English conversation, but I had been missing my parents so much since arriving, and I felt comforted just hearing her voice.  I think I must have been talking a million miles a minute cause I was so excited - she barely got a word in edgewise!  haha!  I look forward to speaking to both my parents on Monday when they get home to Thunder Bay.  When I got home it was time for dinner, but nothing in my cupboard looked remotely appetizing.  Still on my 'high of bravery', I decided a fast-food dinner was in order.  I walked on down to the closest fast food joint - a Korean chain (correct me if I'm wrong...maybe they have these in the US?) called Popeye's.  I had a cajun chicken burger and fries for dinner, and it was the first meat I've eaten since the plane!  YUM!  The restaurant was really cool because the eating area was up on the second floor, which provided a perfect view of the streetscape below.  One thing definitely worth mentioning, is that Korean cities are night are BREATHTAKING.  In the day Shiheung City is rather drab, dirty, and dare I say...plain?  At night, that all changes....  All the buildings and stores in Korea are covered in magnificent, brilliant NEON lights!  There is neon literally *everywhere* you look!  Flashing lights!  Changing colours!  Dazzling designs!  It's like living in a giant arcade!  It really is absolutely amazing just to walk around and look at all the lights - Vegas pales in comparison to Korean cities.  I wish you could see them - it really is incredible!  (I promise to take lots of pictures!)  After dinner I thought it was a perfect time to go and find out what that Kolon-Mart was all about...  I entered the store, and discovered that Kolon-Mart is like the Korean version of The Superstore - a huge store selling groceries and books and clothes and electronics and tons of other stuff - WOW!  I was in heaven!  I grabbed a basket (bring on the impulse buying!) and proceeded to walk up and down every single aisle slowly just to take it all in...  It was clean and bright and the ailes were wide...it was almost like being back home, only with everything in Korean!    So there I am, meandering through the frozen foods section, in a consumerist daze, when all of a sudden...I heard a voice...  "Hey man, how's it goin'?"  I turned turned my head and saw....A CAUCASIAN MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Oh My God!  Seriously, I just about shit my pants!!!  I could not believe my eyes!  His name was Charles, he looked about my age, and was the first English speaker I've seen since arriving in Korea.  Yes, he was teaching English too, and lived about 2 minutes from Kolon-Mart.  Charles is from New Jersey, and this is his third (or fourth?) time teaching and living in Asia.  Someone to talk to!  A new friend!  Finally!!!!!!!!  However, my excitement quickly faded away, the longer the conversation continued...  Something about Charles seemed a little...off...  He was shifty and sketchy-looking, and looked like he came from the shallow end of the gene pool.  (sorry that was too harsh...but something about him just did not look  right .)   I just got a really bad vibe from him...  Every fourth word out of his mouth was fuck, he seemed to have a lot of negative views about people he had already met, told me right off the bat that he didn't want to talk about Canadian-American politics, and then proceeded to tell me about his other experiences when he lived in Asia before.  Including getting drunk every night with the Chinese when he lived in China, and working as a stripper in Taiwan.  (and trust me, on the hot-or-not scale, this guy would rate about a '2'.)  Murphy's Law - the first foreigner I meet, and he's right out of Jerry Springer.  We chatted for about a half hour or so, and then exchanged email addresses.  On my way home I kept going over the unusual conversation we had, and tried to figure out the strange vibe I got from him.  He made me feel uneasy, and I contemplated not ever contacting him again, but then realized that would be foolish.  First off, maybe I'm being too judgemental?  I mean I only just met the guy - maybe he just gives really, *really*, REALLY bad first impressions....  And secondly, for fuck's sake he's someone who speaks English!!!  That is a resource that I just can *not* throw away.  He may be a serial killer and eat puppies for breakfast, but he speaks English and seems to know the neighbourhood fairly well, including which bus to catch to the subway (I told him about the supposed half-hour ride on the #1 bus to Sosa Station, but apparently he's been on a different bus that gets him to Bucheon Station (the one after Sosa) in like fifteen minutes!!!)  Yes, I hate to say it, but I need Charles in my life.  And he even knows another Canadian living in his building!  As weird as he is, I'm willing to give Charles another chance.  I'll email him later and see what happens...wish me luck.

      So my morning with the kindergartens was rather amusing!  I sat in on an English lesson being taught by a 'guest teacher' who only comes to our school once in a while.  She had these really funny computer games for the kids to play.  Today's first lesson was entitled "I Have To Go Potty" and was all about the importance of how 'to go poopy' properly (ie: the correct order for pooping, wiping, flushing, and washing) and what perils lie in waiting if we all don't follow it!!!  These 3 animated characters, "Jolly", "Vanilla", and some-other-whose-name-I-forget re-enacted over and over for the kids on screen about proper bathroom etiquette, and really, it took all I had not to laugh out loud....  But hey, I guess it's important stuff to know, right?  :-)  I had my first few lessons on my own this morning too, going over the alphabet and the spelling of basic words (fill in the blank kinda stuff) with the kindergartens.  They're all absolutely adorable, and when I first walk into the class they all run up and hug my leg and don't want to let go!  They're more difficult to teach than the older kids, even though the lessons are much simpler, just because of their fact that their attention spans last about 5 minutes and then they're bored, so you I have to keep things lively and changing to keep them interested.  At home for lunch I was all looking forward to enjoying a can of beans...yumm....(yes, the simplest things in life really do give the most pleasure, especially these days!) when all of a sudden I realized..."Fuck!  I don't have a can opener!!!"  Well, there goes that idea!!!  And there it formed - my mission for the day - to seek out and purchase the ever-elusive can opener.  (I figure if I give myself, and accomplish, at least one important mission which will make my life any easier, than it's been a successful day!)    The afternoon proved to be alright - I got to test my acting skills today when I had to be a mime for the kids and "mime/act out" objects/animals/emotions/body parts that they had to guess.  Quite a fun game actually - they seemed to love watching me transform myself (in absolute silence of course, hence the power of miming) into a variety of things, ranging from an airplane to a spoon to a shoe to any and every farm animal imaginable.  (I'm expeting my Academy Award For Miming to arrive in the mail any day now...)  I had an hour and a bit to kill in between blocks today, so I decided to go for a walk and check out more of the neighbourhood.  REI is located, methinks, in the sort of 'commercial shopping centre' of Shihung City, or atleast this part of the city.  There's a lot more streets full of stores in this area than I thought, but at least 1/3 of them seems to be a shore store, or someone selling squid.  I've seen squid in every conceivable shape, colour, size, and smell since I've arrived.  Koreans sure do love their squid.  (and no, that's not a bandwagon I'm about to jump on anytime soon!)  During my walk I was thrilled when I discovered a pay phone that *actually* accepts coins, and not just phone cards, which I have yet to purchase.  I attempted to phone my parents, who are visiting Nana in Phoenix, but was informed by an EXTREMELY RUDE OPERATOR BITCH that I couldn't make a collect call to Arizona on a Canadian phone card... What the fuck?  Why not?  When I tried to explain why I was doing so, she responded with "I can't understand you when you're talking and eating at the same time sir!" in a tone that made want to spit.  Was I actually eating anything?  NO!  I'M ON A FUCKIN' PAY PHONE IN SEOUL, KOREA LADY!!!  I swear if I could've reached through that phone to slap her I would have!!  Oooohhhhh!!! Looks like Mom and Dad will have to wait until they get back to Thunder Bay before I can speak to them....*sigh*  On the way back to class, I heard my first English song ever (well, since arriving here in Korea.)  I was almost back at REI, when, like a gift from heaven, there I heard it, blaring from a not-unlike-Gap store in the market....Miss Britney Spears, proclaiming proudly what 'a slave for me' she was....  It totally made my day!  I think it was a sign from above.  I really needed a little Britney at that moment, or really, a little anything English, and it came at just the right time.  After work I set out on my mission to find a can-opener, and once again with a little help from Julia, I was able to find one, along with some tupperware, soap, and a tea towel.  Shopping is a very different experience here, as many stores are just a mix of everything.  10,000 little mini-Walmarts all scattered throughout the market, each containing a slightly different combination of useless items for your household that you never really realize you need until you step into those stores...  Impulse buying at its best.

        Day 3: First Day Of School    Today was my first day of teaching at my new school, and it went smashingly well!  My day is divided into 'blocks' of teaching, beginning at 10:30am.  The morning is spent with the kindergarten-aged children, who are shy, but polite and very adorable.  Teaching English to them is very easy, as right now it is limited to playing games with them that ask them to tell me the colour of the pen I'm holding, or count something, or say 'yes or no' to basic questions I ask them.  A breeze!  I was then given 2.5 hours for lunch - wow!  I went home and chatted a bit online, talking to friends back home and making perhaps my first new friend here in Korea, Etien, an American who I met online who is in the military here in Seoul.  He seems like a really nice guy and almost as lonely as I am!  We may get together this weekend to tour the town.  I'm looking forward to having some English-speaking company!  My afternoon at REI was great!  I had 3 blocks (each block is a half-hour) of elementary kids, and they're my favourite!  They're all extremely excited to have a foreigner at their school (I'm the only foreign teacher working at REI - all the rest are Koreans) and they're fascinated by me!  My height especially seems to enthrall them, and I am especially popular with my young female students who enjoy taking pictures of me on their high-tech camera cell phones to send to their friends.  In each block we played more games, and spent time drawing whatever I asked the kids to draw.  The different games test the kids' vocabularies, and allows them to have fun while using English.    I had an hour in between two of my blocks and spent it hanging out with about a half dozen of the kids in the office.  Several of them presented me with candy, and even though their command of English is limited, it was fun to ask them questions, and they had plenty to ask me.  One of them, a boy also named Scott, seems really attached to me already, but I appear to be a hit with all of them.  I took out my Korean Phrase Book (thanks Barb, great gift!) and I had a blast with the kids as they helped me with my Korean and I helped with them their English.  They love it when I attempt basic Korean, especially when I occasionally mangle the words.  The other teachers there are really nice, especially one girl Julia who works mainly in the office.  Her English is best out of all the other teachers, and she was really friendly.  She had plenty of questions to ask me, and was eager to practice her English.  She seems really sweet, and also keen to help me with my questions.  Every Korean I have met so far has been extremely polite and helpful, and Julia even went as far to accompany me after work to show me where I can buy an alarm clock.  4 of my female elementary kids followed along, and it was fun to wander through the stores browsing.  After finding a clock, Julia headed off home, but the 4 young girls continued to follow me through the market, holding my hand and running around me dancing and chasing each other.  I went back to the grocery store to buy some more food, and it was fun to shop for food with 3 11-year olds and the one 9-year old!  They helped me find food and pick out 'what tasts best' - they especially loved the cookie aisle!  They then walked me home and yelled "bye-bye Scott" as they ran off home.  SO CUTE!!!  I feel a lot more comfortable here already, and my kids have been wonderful.  I think I'm really going to like teaching English to them, and am sure that I will bond to quite a few.  I'm looking forward to doing some serious exploring of Seoul this weekend in my free time - if only now I can figure out how to get to the nearest subway station!  Step by step I seem to figure things out - I've just gotta learn to be more patient sometimes!  It's in my nature to 'land and conquer' immediately, but Seoul is going to take some time.  As my Mom used to always tell me while growing up "patience is a virtue", and I definitely need to practice that here.  But so far it's so good, and I'm looking forward to my day tomorrow.

        Day 2: First Impressions    Today was Sunday, and the first (and only) full day I had to myself before starting work on Monday.  I slept in late, and then had a lovely breakfast of toast and water while sitting on my bed watching the Grammy's on M-Net, Korea's music station.  Prior to the Grammy's I got to watch bits of Korea's Top 50 music videos - a fascinating experience in musical cheese at its best.  Each video attempted to out-cheese the other, with long emotional ballads involving Koreans crying and chasing each other in fields or in the rain while cooing for the camera, or with boy bands (still alive and well in Korea) jumping around some stadium stage getting mauled by teenage girls but pretending not to care, or with bad-ass Korean rocker-pop chicks getting their groove on in slick sexy warehouses, hair constantly moving, yet perfect in every frame.  Perfectly cheesy - I loved every minute.  Korean commercials are my favourite to watch.  Because I can't understand what they're saying, I enjoy trying to guess what product the commercial is for until it is finally revealed.  The ones that always throw me off the most are the ones for 'feminine products'.  (I never see it coming!)  :-)  Steven came by around noon to take me out and show me where the school is.  REI American Language School is the name of the school I'll be teaching at, and it's about a ten-minute walk from where I live.  The school is located in the local market area, which is fascinating to wander through.  At the market, which is always busy, one can buy just about anything, from clothing to shoes to squid to tupperware.  I TOWERED above the crowd and felt like a giant.  Steven then took me to the local grocery store and bought me my first load of groceries - very kind of him indeed.  Him and his family have been extremely welcoming and accommodating, and have been very generous to me.  The grocery store was small and had limited selection, but it was fun to wander the aisles and gaze at all the Korean products, none of which contained any English, save for a couple key words here and there on a few products.  I had the afternoon to myself, so I decided to take a long walk and explore my neighbourhood on foot.  Shihung City, according to its signposts, boasts itself as "clean and beautiful".  In all honesty the area seems rather dirty and run-down to me, but I'm most likely thinking that because I've been spoiled by living in luxurious Vancouver.  It was fun to wander down random streets to see what I could find.  Shihung is a mix of industrial, commercial and residential buildings, all sharing the same block often.  Absolutely massive high-rise housing complexes consume the cityscape, mixed in with older low-rise homes.  I was surprised to come across a few familiar Western chains, including 7-11, Baskin Robins, and Dunkin Donuts.  I'll definitely have to check those out later!  What was most surprising to me was the fact that I spent the whole afternoon wandering around, and not once did I see a single Caucasian person.  NOT ONE!  I think foreigners must be a bit of a novelty in this part of the city, because I get plenty of stares and even have random Korean girls giggle and wave at me!  I feel like a bit of a celebrity and am not used to all the stares and attention, but it's fun anyways.  It's a bit lonely not having anyone to talk to, as my conversations are limited to my boss who speaks basic English at best, but I'm sure it's just a matter of time until I come across some other foreigners.  This weekend I hope to venture into central Seoul and feel pretty confident I'll find some them.    I spent the evening at home surfing the net and watching TV.  One thing that I've learned for sure in the last day or two is that technology is *amazing*.  At one time I was talking on Messenger to 3 friends of mine, all in different corners of the globe - Arion in Marysville, Washington, Travis in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Matt in London, England.  And me in Seoul, Korea!  AMAZING!  All connected, all together, yet thousands of kilometres apart.  Which leads me to ask, if we were all up and awake, when the hell does anyone sleep!!!???  I feel lonely at times, but having internet at home helps me feel better by staying well connected to my friends all over the globe.  People whine and cry all the time about all the burdens that technology has brought us, but at this moment, I am so very thankful for it.  GOD BLESS THE INTERNET!

         Day 1: Safe & Sound    Well here I am, alive and well, in the Land Of The Morning Calm - Korea!!!  I arrived here in Seoul after an 11-hour flight over the BC Coast, Alaska's Aleutian Islands, and Japan.  I was bitter that not only did I not get a window seat, but the lucky bastards who did *slept* through most of the flight!  (Rule #1 about flying - if you're blessed enough to receive a window seat, you must use every single minute to savour the unreal experience that it is to fly thousands of feet above our magnificent Earth's surface, otherwise give up your goddamned seat if all you're gonna do is sleep!)  :-)  I was hoping, as a 'safe back-up plan', to be bumped up to first class by some sympathetic flight attendant, but alas, my hopes for such were all in vain....  (Note to self - must flirt even more, with any and all flight attendants, regardless of age, gender, sexuality, or level of attractiveness, in order to fulfill desires of flying first class without paying for such.) I must say that I was impressed with AirCanada's service on this long haul.  And I can tell you that it is a VERY RARE occurrence for me to be impressed that with airline.  The food was plentiful and delicious, and we were given a variety of movies and tv shows to entertain us as we sailed westward over the horizon.    We landed at Seoul's Incheon International Airport at 5pm and I was thrilled to be in Korea.  While landing I got a few glimpses of the sprawling ginormous megacity that is Seoul.  Seoul, at 18 million, is the world's fifth largest city and it was amazing to see it spread out in every direction as far as the eye could see.  Incheon is a brand spanking new airport constructed on an artificial island in the ocean, about 52 km. from Seoul.  The huge multi-billion dollar airport is clean, bright, modern, and very English-friendly.  There was about a dozen of us "Non-native Koreans" on the plane and we had to file into 2 lines for Immigration, which proved to be a breeze to get through.    I claimed my luggage (yes Mom, I packed WAY TOO MANY CLOTHES) and gave myself ahernia (sp?) carrying it out.  Oh wait...there's one of those handy airport carts.  THANK GOD.  I was met by boss, Steven, and his family (his wife Susan, and his daughters Sandy and Ester.)  They were excited to meet me and very friendly.  Into their car we jumped, and then it was off to the mainland to my new apartment. On the way into the city (which basically has grown right to the shores of the Yellow Sea) I was able to take in the view of the periphery of this megacity.  Incheon is also Seoul's main port city and the waterfront was lined with port facilities at sizes beyond my comprehension.  The ocean was full of dozens of huge ocean-going ships coming and leaving port.  Massive freeways led into the city, lined with rows upon rows upon rows of soaring, near-identical, high rise apartment towers.  I felt like I had landed on an alien planet, and was enthralled with the sights.  As an urban planner at heart, my poor lil eyes just couldn't take it all in fast enough.    I live in one of Seoul's southwest suburbs, Shihung City, and by the time we got there it was dark.  I live in the basement suite of the house my boss and his family lives in.  It's a bit of a hole, but it's cozy and comfortable.  (I'm *loving* the heated floors in my bedroom!)  My apartment consists of a small kitchen with a fridge, table and chairs, sink, microwave, toaster, rice cooker, and a small gas stove.  My bedroom has a big comfy bed, and to my surprise, a computer with internet, and a TV with cable!  YAH!!!!  That was definitely a bonus that I was not expecting.    Now as for my bathroom situation...well....let's just say I'd describe it as "unique".  There is one room for the toilet, which is accessed via my bedroom.  You open a door, walk up three LARGE steps, and there it is, under the stairs...hmm....  As for the shower, well that's in another room by the front door.  In that room, the shower is the WHOLE room, so when I shower, everything gets wet - walls, floor, washing machine, everything.  The showerhead is one of those annoying little hand-held thingies, situated about 2 feet off the floor.  Luckily I can pull it off the wall and 'aim at will', but I've also already mastered the whole 'lather-rinse-repeat' deal while croutched down on the floor with my eyes closed, trying to touch as little of the -45 C floor as possible.  Oh yeah, about hot water...I seem to have plenty (although it does come and go at will while I'm showering) but everytime I want hot water for either the shower or the kitchen sink I have to push a button to 'turn it on' on the wall.  Quite interesting indeed.  I've already unpacked fully and have made my apartment that much cozier and homey.  I was feeling *serious* jet lag by the time 11pm came in Seoul and so I went to bed and slept a wonderful 11-hour sleep.  Sweet dreams for me...

      So money is one of the few things in life that stress me out, and I'm always in a constant battle not to think about it too much.  For the last few years, before coming to Korea, I had pretty much been living paycheque to paycheque.  Because I lived in crazy-expensive Vancouver, every penny had to be carefully managed.  40% of all my earnings just went to rent (in slower months closer to 50%!) and the rest was split between food, bills, student loan payments, and of course, attempting to maintain an active social life!  Well things have certainly changed since coming to Korea.  I don't pay rent.  I don't pay bills (well, as in hydro or cable or internet bills).  All I pay for is my own food.  And the rest is all for me to do with as I please.  This has been a HUGE WEIGHT lifted off of my shoulders, as now, for the first time in my life, I have a substantial flow of cash coming in, without all of it being so quickly diverted into the seemingly bottomless coffers of all my debts before I even had a chance to see it.  This new financial situation feels much, much better, I can tell you that much!  But it certainly hasn't been without its frustrations here!  My boss has been paying me, but because money has been tight this month at the school, with the new semester starting and all, they've only been able to afford to pay me in little chunks here and there instead of getting it all in one lump sum.  This has been kind of a pain in the ass, as I'm not used to finances being handled so informally.  Apparently Korean hagwons (private language schools) are notorious for trying to cheap their teachers out of their proper earnings, and that has always been a fear of mine, but fortunately I'm not quite in that sort of situation.  I have been getting paid, it's just been taking longer than what I thought it would be, and it's been in spurts of cash to me here and there.  I've been trying hard not to let this stress me out either!  My boss is quite possibly the most honest man I've ever met so I have complete faith that I will get paid, in full, eventually.  We've had talks about the current system, and he's uncomfortable with it as well.  Luckily things are supposed to change next month and that's when regular, formal payments will begin, with me getting paid bi-weekly.  That will be so much better and easier for me!!!    Steven and I went and opened my Korean bank account here today - FINALLY!!  This was the last major bureaucratic formality that I had to take care of, and now it's complete.  I have a bank account, with an ATM card, a bank book, and even know how to do money transfers back to my account in Canada which is actually very simple to do.  Ahhhh...let's all breathe a sigh of relief together, shall we?  Now I can appease the evil demons known as American Express, as well as silence the quieter-yet-equally-greedy Visa, MasterCard, and oh yeah, those student loan thingies as well!  Hooray - I'm a university graduate who's actually able to afford to pay off his debts now!  Write that one in the history books!!!  ;-)

      Every so often during the year Korea receives a little present from China.  Well, it's actually a fairly large present - Yellow Sand.  Yellow Sand is a strange phenomenon that I had yet to encounter before moving here to Asia, and I'm still getting used to seeing it.  What is it, you may ask?  Well, Yellow Sand is just exactly that - yellow sand.  Massive windstorms sweep up billions upon billions of tiny grains of yellow sand from China's Gobi Desert, suck it up into the atmosphere, blow it all the way across China and the West Sea...and dump it on Korea.  You'll wake up and go outside and everything will be covered in a very light dusting of yellow sand.  It looks almost like pollen, but duller in colour and obviously much coarser.  And man does it do wonders for Korea's air problems!  (And by 'wonders', I mean exasperate the severe problem even more!)  Between creating it's own air pollution via massive industry, power generation, and the private automobile, Yellow Sand just makes it a thousand times worse.  Somedays I'll walk to work and it'll be crystal clear outside and the skies will be SO BLUE!  And then the next day I can't even see a few hundred metres down the road because of all the smog and sand in the air - such extremes here!  Sometimes the sand will fall during the night so when you wake up the skies will be clear, but everything will be covered in a light yellow dusting.  So strange!  As a Canadian I've seen just about every other kind of precipitation that you can imagine, but sand from the sky is definitely a new thing for me.  It's kinda cool to look at, but it's pretty gross to be outside in when it's in the air.  It's hard to breathe and apparently is really quite destructive on your lung tissue over long-term exposure.  (Luckily I'm only here for a year, eh?)  I keep wanting to collect some of it to save, but such a fine layer falls that you can't really 'scoop it up into a jar' as I'd like to.  Next time we get a major dumping of yellow sand I'll try and take some photos to show you guys!  Just another unique marvel here in Asia...

      Every once in a while I get the occasional reminder that I'm not a kid anymore, that yes, I'm an "adult".  All grown up.  And heaven forbid, getting..."older"......with each passing day.  What's that all about?  I don't get it!  haha!  I'm only 25, and I'm being silly here, but in all honesty I do sometimes get these little 'metaphorical post-it notes' letting me know, that yes, time is indeed passing.  And I just got a big ass post-it note the other day...  MY BABY SISTER HAS MOVED OUT OF THE HOUSE!!!  What the hell!!!???  Actually it's no surprise at all.  I knew this day was coming.  Heck I even helped her and Jeff (her boyfriend) find their new apartment in Vancouver.  But still, it was only this week, when I realized that she was on the road with all her stuff driving out to the West Coast, that she really has left the nest.    Part of me says "Finally!  It's about time!  She's 22-almost-23 - time for her to make it on her own!" but the vast majority of me (or at least the loudest of the two voices) screams out "Holy shit!  Your baby sister is not a baby anymore!  She's moving out of the house and is going to be living with her...BOYFRIEND!!?????????  Whoa...."    It's definitely a reality check for me.  She's not my baby sister anymore.  She's a grown-up adult too, and, like me, she's left the comfort and security of home to go out and discover the world and pursue her dreams.  Still, I always think of her as my 'baby sister' that I gotta look out for.  The little girl who I used to play Cabbage Patch dolls with, who I used to wrestle with after dinner every night, who used to shit in the bathtub when I was in it with her, who I used to spend endless hours tobogganing at Grandma's farm with racing down off the shed roof or into The Pit at Mach 7, who I used to play hide-and-go-seek or sardines or capture the flag out at camp with Jennifer and the Adams boys, who would dance and sing with me to all our favourite pop songs (Roxette! Billy Ocean! Madonna! Janet Jackson! Ace of Base!) , who I used to build forts and obstacle courses for our hamsters with, who's Barbie house I used to knock down in 'sudden earthquakes' (gotta watch out for those active fault lines running under your bedroom Janelle!), who's skull I accidentally bit open when we collided while playing tag one day, who used to play hangman and doodle with me on those long long family road trips across Canada and the US, who used to wake me up at the crack of dawn every Christmas to open presents (and still does today.)  She's the still the same girl, but just all grown up now.  Wow.  Time really has gone by so quickly....  AND I'M SO PROUD OF HER!!!  I think that her and Jeff are going to love living in Vancouver.  It's such an amazing city and I think this experience will really open their eyes to a lot of things in life.  It's kinda funny if you think about it - Vancouver just lost an Erdman child, but this week it's gained another. Now it's my sister who lives there, and it's me who's the guest in town.  A total reversal of roles!  I wish I could be there in the city with them to help them get settled, see how their new amazing apartment is coming together (they have a breathtaking view on the 19th floor that's gotta be seen to be believed!) and would love just to spend time with both of them.  It's a shame that the timing was a bit off and we never got the chance to live together in the same city, but ahhh well, c'est la vie, and I'll be coming back that way eventually anyways.  Until then, good luck Janelle.  Your big brother is proud of ya!  I have every faith and confidence that you and Jeffy are gonna just love it there, and that success will be yours!  I miss you guys, but know that you're doing well in your new home.  Vancouver's an amazing city - live it up every moment, be bold and be crazy and explore absolutely everything.  And be sure to 'represent' us Erdmans!  I'm passing the torch to you!  (but be prepared to give it back in a few years when I return to BC - hey I got there first, after all!  I'm gonna want my throne back eventually...hehe!)

      Brad, Andrea and I slept in sooo late today!  We woke up at 11:30am feeling refreshed and recharged - after yesterday's busy day we really needed the long sleep!  I had to quickly dash back to Shihung City, so I showered, packed up, and said my goodbyes to my friends.  I was meeting up with Steven and his family and didn't want to be late.  I got home just before 2pm, and about 15 minutes later there was a knock on my door - time to go!  Steven's nephew plays drums in a church band every Sunday and so I had been invited to come along to church to see him perform.  Yes, you heard right, Scott Erdman went to church voluntarily!!!  :-)  It was a cute little Presbyterian church just up the road and actually reminded me a lot of my own church back in Thunder Bay.  It was really quiet in there and there were maybe only about 20 people or less at this Sunday afternoon service.  Eric, Steven's nephew was up at the front along with the other band members.  The service started shortly after and the first hour consisted mainly of the band performing songs while everyone sang along. Luckily for me the songs are all in Korean so I had a valid excuse for not singing along!  But I have to say that I was impressed with the music.  Besides having Eric on drums, there was also a guitar-player, someone on piano, a mixer, and 2 backup singers along with the Minister on main vocals.  The music was lively and entertaining and dare I say I was...having fun...*big shock*!  :-)  Wow, who knew things could be so rockin' at church?  After the music stopped, the Minister had noticed that I was there (no surprise there, a foreign stranger is NOT gonna just blend in in a crowd of only 20 Koreans!) and started speaking to me...of course I had no idea what he was saying.  Steven translated for me, saying that he was welcoming me to the church, and to Korea, and that he wanted me to say hello to everyone.  So, I stood up in front of the church, gave my best "annyong haseyo" (means hello) and was rewarded with...applause....from the rest of the church!??  Too funny!  The second hour was all talk and blah blah blah from the bible, none of which, obviously, I understood, so that part was pretty boring.  All in all it wasn't that bad I guess.  After church we were all invited over to Steven's sister's house for food and conversation.  They live nearby and we spent pretty much the rest of the day there eating and chatting and listening to music (the kids brought out Westlife for me to listen to...haha...I should have guessed!)  We talked, us adults, about a variety of things, from NoKo-SoKo politics to the unbelievable size of Canada to how they respect my near vegetarian diet.  Good times.    They even invited me to spend some holiday time with them this summer.  That could be a lot of fun, but at the same time spending that much time with pretty much non-English speakers could get a little lonely after a while.  I mean they always make efforts to speak to me, but during 'conversations' 90% of the time I just sit there and daydream, having no idea what they're talking about.  It's a bit isolating, but I've gotten used to that here in Korea.  It's like you're there but you're not.  I'm not criticizing it or anything, it's nobody's fault.  Hell their English vocabulary is a million times larger than my Korean one!  It just feels a bit sometimes like you're....a ghost...a silent observer of things.  I've gotten used to it, but again, I don't know if I could handle that for a whole week or something while on vacation with them.  An evening is usually enough for me!  I guess we'll see...

      I woke up today to hear Brad stirring around the room - which, by the way, was *at least* 450 C!  He groggily announced that it was 6:30am - only 40 minutes 'til departure time!!!  Oh shit time to get ready!!!  The 4 of us had the fastest showers ever and got our bags all packed up for a day outside of Seoul.  This was my first time travelling outside the city since arriving and I was quite excited about it!  We were all sooooo tired though when we got to the USO tour office just around the corner from our hotel - it was just after 7am and we all only had about 5 hours of sleep.    Our tour that day consisted of 2 busses of all foreigners (mostly Americans) and we headed out towards the DMZ caravan-style.  Our tour guide was pretty cool but his English was a little hard to understand.  The DMZ, it turns out, is A LOT closer to Seoul than I thought it was.  It was only 45 minutes into our bus ride when our tour guide announced that North Korea was already in plain view.  We were driving on the Freedom Highway (the highway that South Korea has built right up to the border of North Korea in the hopes that one day when unification happens it will become the principle artery connecting the two halves) and right across the river was the legendary North Korea.  The North Koreans have stripped all the hills along the river of their trees and so the landscape in NoKo looks barren, forboding and lifeless - strangely appropriate for a poverty-stricken, occasionally-aggressive, Communist state.  We were forbidden to take any photos from the bus at this time and were told that our cameras would be confiscated if we tried.  Actually for most of the day we were in militarily-sensitive territory so we were not able to take photos very often.  Here's a brief explanation of what we were driving into.  The DMZ is a 4 km-wide buffer zone in between the two Koreas, stretching all the way across from the West Sea to the East Sea.  It was established at the end of the Korean War back in 1953 and is an area of 'neutral territory' where neither side is allowed to enter with military weapons or machines - it is a carefully-established and heavily-monitored Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) with the hopes of minimizing conflict and violence between the two nations by placing a large pristine tract of wilderness inbetween two of the largest armies on Earth.  It is maintained and monitored by the United Nations Command, but still the North Koreans stare out across towards the South Korean and American military forces....    Camp Bonifas is the American base right at the edge of the DMZ and it was here that we had to transfer to a UN bus.  Before boarding this bus, however, we were given a 15-minute presentation on why the DMZ exists and what purpose it serves.  It was very informative and slightly chilling actually, with its brief but gruesome summary of the horrors that took place during the Korean War.  It also highlighted several of the small 'skirmishes' or occasinal outbreaks of violence that have broken out between the two nations since the border was established.  What really brought it home for me was how after the presentation we all had to sign waivers which would effectively remove the UN from all liability for our lives if, by slim chance, North Korea happened to decide to invade at the moment our tour was right in the middle and we were all blown to kindgom come.  LOVELY!!!  Hey, at least we were given nifty "United Nations Guest" passes to wear which were super cool.  (Our group of 7, who had the giggles for most of the day, often would walk around, point to our tags, and say "I'm with the UN!" - hey we all thought we were really cool anyways!!)  We then boarded the special UN bus and headed into the DMZ.  Because the DMZ has been relatively untouched over the last 50 years it is a very beautiful area - plenty of grassy fields, thick forests, and lots of waterfowl and other animals inhabit the area.  The road through the DMZ was full of anti-tank devices, and the bush on both sides of the road was full of minefields - I guess these forests aren't quite as pristine as I imagined!  Numerous watch towers and guard posts throughout the DMZ watch over the area towards North Korea - constant careful monitoring in case the North becomes violent again.  We went to a building complex that is situated RIGHT ON THE EDGE of the SoKo side of the DMZ where peace talks are occasionally held between the two sides.  Soldiers from both sides stand on guard, cold and emotionless, staring each other down from their respective sides, only mere metres away....  What was really amazing was that we were actually allowed to enter the room where the actual peace talks are held and look around and take photos!  This room sits *exactly* on the border - half is in South Korea, and half is in North Korea.  In this room a ROK (Republic of Korea) guard stands in this special particularly-intimidating pose to thwart off any potential aggression from the North.  He literally just stands perfectly still and looks almost like a mannequin!  We were allowed to go up to him and take photos but could not touch him or interfere with his 'military stance.'  At this point we were actually standing  across the border , on the side belonging to the North...so yes, technically I can say that I have been to North Korea and I would not be lying!!!  Eerily fascinating....    Near this area is a brand new highway and railway that leads right up to the border, and then just....disappears.  SoKo is still waiting for NoKo to finish their half, and has even given them 5-billion Won worth of construction equipment to help them out, but NoKo has yet to even come close to connecting their half...  And so this lonely, empty highway just sits and waits, waiting for the day when the two sides will overcome their differences and reunite.  Progress has been made slowly in recent peace talks, but I still think that it's going to be a long time before this happens, sadly.   After this we went to another building up this hill that had a magnificent sweeping view of North Korea - barren hills and cities in the distance...  What was right in front of us though, in plain view, was NoKo's Propaganda Village.  It's actually called Gijong, but it's a town built on the border of North Korea where absolutely no one lives.  All of the buildings are empty, and many in fact are simply  wooden cutouts  of structures.  In the middle stands one of the tallest flag poles in the world with an absolutely massive NoKo flag.  (side note: SoKo had built a flag pole first on their side, but then, in 'retaliation' NoKo had to build a flag pole almost twice as tall, just to 'one-up' SoKo.)  Throughout this ghost town and the fields surrounding it are super giant loud speakers, which blast out propaganda at incredibly loud volumes 6-12 hours a day at the South Koreans.  The propaganda praises NoKo's president and attempts to encourage South Koreans to defect to the North.  Massive signs sit atop the hills, all facing towards SoKo, all with messages of praise for the North and its president.  One sign, translated, even reads "Yankees Go Home."  SoKo doesn't have the propaganda speakers, but it does have super giant electric signs on its hills with messages advertising the 'freedom' and 'prosperity' that can be found in the South.  Seriously, it's right out of George Orwell's 1984 and is freaky when you think about it too much.  Panmunjoem is a South Korean village that has the misfortune of being the only settlement (well, inhabited one!) in the DMZ.  About 200 farmers live here in subsidized, tax-free homes where they grow rice in massive fields surrounding the town.  These villagers are financially well-off thanks to the government, but are supervised 24 hours a day by armed guards, even when they are out in their fields farming, and have an 11pm curfew that they are forbidden to break.  Again, a very Orwellian-like village - quite creepy and the tension in the air surrounding this area is so thick and heavy.  I can't imagine what it must be like to live in this village, so close to an enemy that so badly wants to destroy you.    If you think that is scary, you'll never believe what we saw after lunch!!  After our not-so-yummy military buffet lunch, we took a bus to visit the Third Tunnel.  Since the establishment of the DMZ, the South Koreans have discovered four tunnels that the North Koreans have built,  under the DMZ , and right into South Korea!!!  Some of these tunnels are large enough that tanks could drive through in the event of a sneak attack....  If these tunnels aren't evidence of North Korea's continuing aggression then I don't know what is!  The most recent of these tunnels was discovered in 1990 and apparently experts think that there are probably at least another 20 tunnels or so under the border that have yet to be found...  When asked about the tunnels, the North Koreans either claim that they don't know of their existence, or accuse South Korea of building them.  Sometimes they've even come up with lame excuses, claiming that the tunnels are either 'natural cavities' under the Earth, or are 'abandoned coal mines'.  They've even gone as far to  paint the rock inside the tunnel  black to make it look like coal when it's so clearly granite!!!   SO FUCKING SCARY!!!  The Third Tunnel, discovered in 1978, has now been stabilized and cleared of all dynamite and mines.  It's also been fortified and blockaded so that the North Koreans can't use it in the event of an attack.  You can actually ride a small, rollercoaster-like train *down into the tunnel*!  It was fun yet scary at the same time as the access train tunnel is BARELY wider than the train itself so you have to wear helmets cause in a few places the roof is extremely low.  The train takes you 300 metres below the Earth's surface down to the Third Tunnel, where we could walk along for several hundred metres.  The tunnel is dark and yet and is VERY LOW (I'd say no higher than 5'6") and I had to really duck for the entire time I was in there.  This tunnel is definitely not the place to be if you're claustophobic!!  We walked along right up to the blockade that separates us from the North Koreans - WOW!!!  Apparently they have collapsed the portion of the tunnel on their side to try and cover up that they have built it though....  After the tunnel it was time to head back on our regular bus back to Seoul.  It was a fascinating yet scary tour and one that I'll remember for always.  To think that all of this hostility and aggression and tension exists only an hour away from the capital!!  Wow!  After we got back into the city, Amy, Emily, and Kelsey went back home while Steve, Andrea, Brad and I went and got ice cream from a nearby Baskin Robbins.  After that Steve went home and the three of us decided that since we were still in the city we'd do some more sightseeing.  We took a taxi over to Yeouido Island to visit the 63 Building, where I had been walking around a few weeks ago.  This time we actually went into Korea's tallest building, and took an elevator up to the observation deck up on the 60th floor.  THE VIEW WAS ASTOUNDING!!!  It was evening time when we were up there so the golden light of the sun was perfect for illuminating the whole city without being too blinding.  We spent a good hour enjoying the breathtaking vistas of the sprawling megalopolis down below - giant freeways clogged full of traffic, the many bridges crossing the Han River, rows upon rows of identical high rise apartments, and mountains surrounding the city on several sides.  So beautiful!!!  After that we went for a bit of a walk around the island just enjoying the sunny weather.  We came across this outdoor ampitheatre where several hundred screaming teenage girls were gathered.  Up on stage was some Korean pop boy band singing autographs, and these girls were going NUTS just waiting in line for their turn!  It was quite funny!  We then took a taxi back across the river and decided to grab some dinner at this really fabulous Indian buffet restaurant.  (A day full of buffets, it seems!)  We decided that none of us were ready to go home yet, and that we wanted to spend another night in the city.  Brad suggested we get another hotel room and then go and check out Dondaemun Market - an all-night shopping centre!!!  We went and got another cheap hotel room (Wow!  A night in a hotel room two nights in a row?  I should be so lucky!!!)  We had showers, watched To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything, Julie Newmar (cheesy but very funny) and then headed out for some shopping around midnight or so.  The shopping area of Dondaemun was just around the corner from our hotel and it was really amazing!  Picture several giant department stores covered completely in neon - flashing colours ten-stories tall, dancing before your very eyes.  And the streets are packed!!!  It was like 1am and yet the streets were full of people out shopping - so cool!!!  We spent a good 2 hours just wandering around, taking it all in.  One thing note-worthy is that Korean sales people are EXTREMELY PUSHY!  Seriously, if you even stop just to *look* a shirt (never mind pick it up) and they will honestly *run* over and be like "You want to buy?  Good price!  Shirt you like?" and be right in your face about it.  It's quite intimidating actually and you learn quickly not to linger at any clothing stand for longer than half a second, and to NOT EVER make eye contact with one of the sales staff!!!  By 2am we were all really starting to crash (we had been up for almost 20 hours!) and so we headed back to the hotel room.  We crashed and slept like the dead!  After such a busy day it's no surprise though!  WOW!  ANOTHER REALLY AMAZING DAY IN KOREA!!!  THIS COUNTRY ROCKS!!!!  If Canadians knew how cool Korea really was, and what a great lifestyle you can lead over here on the income they give you, there'd be a line-up at the airport for potential teachers to come here.  Moving to Seoul was one of the best decisions I ever made and today really illustrated that.  It feels really great to be here -  I'm lovin' it!  (insert McDonald's theme song here, if it pleases you.)  :-)

      Another easy-going day today.  We're still singing the Christian pop song in class, but, rather funnily, this has proved to be *not* popular with the kids!  They don't like singing the song!!  I doubt it's for the same reasons why I don't like it, but they groan and whine everytime I put it on.  Maybe it's too mellow and boring even for their tastes.  The kids are REALLY into the Westlife songs and hell I'll listen to My Love a million times in a row over one listen of the painfully boring and cheesy and poorly-choreographed Power Of Your Love!  Either way I have to confess that I kinda smirk everytime the kids resist singing the song.  We still have to practice it everyday and I enforce that, but I'm glad I'm not the only one that doesn't enjoy this song.  When their next dance practice is for the Power Of Your Love, I haven't heard anything...  Still no barnyard furry friends in school today...that makes me very happy!  :-)  So I've been feeling a bit sick all week, having come under a bit of a cold since the weekend.  I had been fighting it quite well all week long but today it seemed to have caught up with me.  By the time the end of the day came I was SO TIRED and was just feeling really achy and headachy.  I just wanted to relax at home after work and go to bed early, but couldn't because I was heading into the city to meet up with Brad and the gang.  We're going on a tour of the DMZ tomorrow (the buffer zone in between North and South Korea!!!) and because the tour starts so damn early we're getting a hotel room tonight.  I packed up my overnight bag and then watched a bit of TV before leaving.  Yesterday in the mail arrived another package from Barb - FOUR (4!) videotapes full of my fave shows, plus some Easter candy, including the much-coveted Cadbury Mini-Eggs!!!!  BARB YOU'RE THE BEST!!!!!!  Ahhh....there's nothing like laying on your bed, watching Survivor, and eating your most favourite chocolate in the whole wide world!  I took the train into central Seoul and met up with everyone - Brad, Andrea, Amy, Steve, and 2 new girls - Kelsey and Emily.  The girls had booked 2 hotel rooms near our pick-up spot for the tour and I was excited about staying overnight in a hotel.  I LOVE STAYING IN HOTELS!!!   I've always been like that, not sure why.  I get so excited to stay in a hotel, doesn't matter where or how nice or shitty the room is.  And when you're with a big group of friends it's even more fun.  The 7 of us went out for a drink at a bar across the street from the hotel, and then it was time to hit the hay.  I CAN'T WAIT FOR TOMORROW!!!  To think I'm going to get to see a corner of the globe that hardly anyone ever gets to see - one of the most hostile borders in the world - a place where the Cold War still burns fiercely.  It's gonna be amazing!  Oh, before I forget, there's a website that you *HAVE* to check out!  It's called match.com and it's one of those many silly online dating websites, but I discovered it thanks to a friend of mine who had mentioned about taking The Physical Attraction Test which can be found on this website.  I took the test and it was so much fun!  It's a very in-depth test where you are shown various pictures of people and you have to choose who you find the most attractive.  Later you're given comparitive photos and diagrams of various head, face, profile, and body-type shots and you have to do the same thing.  What this test does is scientifically figure out *exactly* what kind of appearances you are physically attracted to.  It's extremely thorough and when you're finished it gives you a very detailed report of all the specifics that, for whatever reasons, seem to turn your crank.  It's really fun and fascinating because my report described me to a 'T'!!!  It was like this test found a way to get INSIDE MY BRAIN and discovered exactly what I go for.  One of the many things that it told me was that I fall into the "Extremely Picky" category - a group of people that are so small (or so damn picky!) when it comes to picking mates that they make up only 1% of the total population!!!  WOW!  This explains why I've been single since before time began!!!  Anyways you should take the test for sure, it's really cool!  Just make sure that before beginning the test you have a good half hour to an hour to kill cause it takes that long to go through the test and then read all your results (I told you it was thorough!!!)  To take The Physical Attraction Test, visit:  www.match.com  and you'll find it there on the main page.  Let me know how you liked the test!!!  :-)

      Today was a really mellow, relaxed day!  I came back to work from lunch in the afternoon, but was told by Steven at the start of my 1:30pm class (the dreaded Grade 1's) that I could go and 'rest in the office' instead of teaching.  Wow, cool!  Turns out that because I had been left to teach all the afternoon classes the two days prior, (which I really don't mind,) Steven was feeling a bit guilty or just wanted to do something nice for me.  So, he actually gave me the whole afternoon off!!  HE TAUGHT ALL FOUR OF MY AFTERNOON CLASSES FOR ME!!!  Yippee!!  He insisted that I sit and relax in the office, and he and Susan fed me coffee and strawberries all afternoon while I sat and read my Lonely Planet: SE Asia On A Shoestring! I ended up just sitting on my ass and reading from 1:30pm all the way until the end of the day - 6pm.  It was really nice, but I felt like such a slacker!  But hey if they're insisting on paying me to sit and read all day I'm not going to fight it!  Man I've got a great job!!!  :-)  So I was pleased today to not hear any 'cheep-cheeps' at all this afternoon.  Neither of the two students brought in their chicks, so I don't know if that means that left them at home, or that they're dead.  I wouldn't be surprised if it's the latter, but I didn't want to ask and find out so I just left it at that.  I'm really hoping that this whole chick thing is done now and that'll be the end of it, but I'm not gonna hold my breath on that one.  Spring is still just beginning and I'm sure this won't be the last time that I have to deal with baby animals in my classroom.  I'm going to try and find some solution anyways, and will keep on trying to educate the kids on how to treat the animals better.  Wish me luck on that one!!!  I went into Itaewon tonight and met up with my friend Michael for dinner.  If you remember Michael was the really nice guy who drove me around Seoul on a little sight-seeing tour of the city back in my first week here in Korea (he's the guy who's met Craig.)  Anyways I hadn't seen him since then as he's been busy switching jobs and moving into a new apartment.  He now has a great little apartment right in Itaewon half a block from all the good clubs (awesome for me - a place to crash on weekends?)  :-)  We went for dinner to this really yummy Indian restaurant called Maharaja.  The food was cheap and awesome and it was my first non-Korean and non-Western food since arriving here.  SO GOOD!!!    Michael is a super cool guy and I really like hanging out with him - he's fun and friendly and has the same interests as I do.  We made some tentative plans to do some hiking and exploring of Korea this summer and I think that will be great fun.  After dinner we went to this really funky lounge down the street where we paid we had 2 ridiculously-overpriced after-dinner drinks.  Michael had a tea and I had a hot chocolate and the bill came to the same amount as what we paid for dinner!!!  What the...???  The lounge had a great atmosphere and was a really cool space but hell I'm not gonna pay $9.00 CDN for a god-damn watery luke-warm fake-whipped cream hot cocoa again!!!  ;-)  Haha!!    It was then time for me catch the train back home.  While on the bus back to Shihung I was sitting at the very back and these two middle-aged guys came on and made their way to where I was sitting.  They were both absolutely shittered and one of them could barely stand!  One of them sat down on the seat next to me while his buddy stood and swayed with the rocking of the bus.  Anyways the drunk guy who sat next to me ended up passing out and sleeping on me!!  And I don't just mean near me, I mean *ON ME!*  It was like he put his head on my shoulder and leaned his whole body in and just started...cuddling?  I wasn't quite sure what to do - I mean the poor guy was so pissed drunk that I didn't want to just shove him off, but it was still kinda weird to have a drunk stranger using me as a pillow.  His buddy meanwhile thought the whole thing was quite funny (as did I) and just watched and laughed.  Their stop was the one before mine so I got to ride like this pretty much all the way home....  I figured that I'd just be a good sport and let the guy sleep on me.  I mean let's admit it, we've all had our moments where we've had a few too many drinks and end up making an ass of ourselves in public, right?  I figured I'd show some support and be like "It's cool buddy, I've been where you are, I got your back, no worries man!"  Let's just call it 'Drunk Karma' - it all comes back to ya!!!  ;-)

      So I got my alien registration card today - YAH!!!  It took a full week to process and Steven picked it up for me this morning from the Immigration Office.  This now means that I can *finally* open up a bank account and start transferring $$$ back to my account in Canada.  (Gotta pay off those lovely student loans somehow!)  I'm gonna try to open an account before the weekend, but since I'll need Steven to come with me to translate, it probably won't be until sometime next week...  Have patience, Scott...have patience...  So the chick was back today.  The same boy who brought his new pet/toy to school yesterday brought it in again today.  And it was a really sad sight, let me tell you.  It was the same chick, but at the same time it wasn't.  In just 24 hours this poor little bird has gone from a cute little energetic chirpy fluffy chick, to a quiet, dirty, ruffled and faded little creature that can no longer stand properly, but instead just hobbles around.  Most of the time the poor thing can't even stand up and just sorta...rolls...around in its box.  I assume that it's because he's been squashed or smothered a few too many times by the kids.  It really is a heart-breaking sight.  It honestly looks like the bird is dying and I'd be surprised if it makes it to the end of the week.  While watching the kids watch the chick today in class, I was saddened to hear more chirping...coming from the hallway...  Yes, another kid had brought in another chick.  One of my female students, this time a Grade 1 student, had a cardboard box with a little yellow ball of fluff not-unlike the boy's new treasure that was introduced to our school yesterday.  Of all kids though, she's one of the least I'd like to see responsible for an animal's well-being.  She was being really rough with the bird and constantly picking the terrified creature up and showing it to all her friends.  This bird did not have a second of peace in its box.  And half the time when she picked it up, she would grab it by either one of its wings or its downy fur and dangle it in the air.  I even caught her squishing the chick into the sides of the box to try and get the bird to chirp more.  I tried really hard not to get upset with her (she is only 7 after all) and tried to show her the proper way to handle a baby animal.  I also tried to encourage her to give it some peace and let it sleep/be alone for a while, but all of that was to no avail.  This student understands very little English, and she's notorious for completely ignoring instructions (as she constantly does in class).  It was like everything I was trying to tell her just did not absorb at all cause I'd look back 30 seconds later and she'd be doing exactly what I had just told her not to do.  It was really upsetting for me to watch this poor helpless creature being treated so poorly.    THESE CHILDREN ARE NOT OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE PETS!!!  They are far too young to be responsible enough to look after an animal, but at my school I seem to be the only one who thinks so.  Trying not to be harsh or judgemental or overly critical, I politely inquired about this unusual phenomenon of very young Korean children coming into possession of these baby animals.  Steven told me how vendors will set up shop with a box of bunnies or chicks  right in front of elementary schools  knowing full well who their market is.  I find this behaviour disgusting!!!  Steven did not seem to be concerned with it at all, and I watched how all the other Korean teachers reacted at the childrens' behaviour towards the birds.  It seemed like they could not care less.  This was really disheartening for me.  I consider myself to be an animal rights activist and I find myself in an awkward position.  I can't just sit and let these kids man-handle these animals to death, but at the same time I'm trying not to be the judgemental foreigner who doesn't always understand the behaviour of the Koreans that surround him.   I've been trying to encourage the kids to treat the animals better, and have been giving lessons and demonstrations on what's best for the chick, but the kids just don't seem to listen at all.  As I mentioned earlier, I really feel that these kids are just too young to have these animals as pets.  I really don't know what to do.

      I was on my own for the entire day today, as Steven was busy at the regional educational office doing whatever it is he does there on his ever-crazy busy days.  I actually kinda like the days when I'm all on my own cause that means I get to set the agenda and decide what we're gonna learn about/discuss/play today.  Overall it was a really good day, and most of my students were well-behaved today.  However, I still had a few challenges to deal with though, including my (not-so) favourite Grade 1 pulling a random tamper-tantrum during the singing of BINGO and ripping down all the newspaper covering a broken window in the classroom. (He was later disciplined by Susan and had to kneel down on the floor, head down, butt in the air, arms stretched out, and stay like that in silence for 15 minutes - quite an unusual punishment if I ever saw one, but hey it seemed to work!)  And later one of my younger students fell off the table and landed quite hard on the floor.  She cried, seriously, for like A FULL HALF HOUR STRAIGHT!!!  Like we're talking non-stop bawling here, which is a long fucking time to cry, believe you me!  I had little sympathy for her as I've told her a million times not to climb on top of the tables because it's dangerous, but I still felt bad for her, of course.  I deal with crying students on a fairly regular basis due to a variety of causes -  a stolen cookie, hair-pulling or biting, or harsh words exchanged amongst the young Koreans - and so am fairly familiar with having to comfort crying children and rectifying whatever situation caused it.  Hell, many a times in a week does a student get a ball in the head, or falls down from the very top of the jungle-gym or something, but usually they cry for like 3 minutes or less and then they're fine.  But his chick, holy fuck, she would NOT STOP CRYING!!  She had no broken bones or sprains, no cuts, broken skin, or bleeding anywhere, so she wasn't critically injured or anything.  But with the volume and duration of her screaming and crying you'd swear she just had her whole leg chewed off by a velociraptor!  As much fun as all that was, the most memorable thing that happened today was during my one-hour coffee break in the afternoon.  I was sitting in the office reading, like I always do, when out of nowhere I heard this "Cheep! Cheep!" coming from the hallway...  It sounded like...a bird???  I poked my head out into the hall and saw one of my students, with a plastic box in his hands.  And inside this box, surrounded by a cushion of ripped-up newspaper, was a little yellow baby chick!  Oh boy I thought....  My friend Gavin (who's place I crashed at Saturday night) had warned me about how the coming spring would mean my students would soon start bringing baby animals to school.  Apparently a popular trick is for children to be bought a baby chick or bunny as a pet, who then bring it to school every day to show their friends.  (Actually he said most of the time they buy the animal themselves as they cost about the same amount as buying a chocolate bar!)  But, he also said, they invariably always only last a few days as the kids don't take very good care of them, in fact they treat the baby animals like toys, and the pet ends up having an untimely premature death.   I didn't really believe him at first, but it's happening already.  This baby chick is probably just the beginning.  I shouldn't be surprised at all - just the other day in the subway I saw this old lady sitting on the stairwell with a basket of bunnies in her lap.  I passed her and thought "Oh dear God I hope she's selling them as pets and not as meat!" (in Korea you just never know!)  Now it's all too clear what she was selling - temporary pets to young Korean children - a trend that sweeps across the nation every single spring here.    As cute as the baby chick was, the kids completely swarmed it as everybody *HAD* to pet it!  And no, they can't wait their turn, they all have to pet it NOW!  I lectured them a few times about treating the baby chick better, and told them "Don't yell - the baby's sleeping!" and this actually seemed to help them in treating the chick more carefully.  I definitely don't want to see this baby chick getting smothered or crushed or neglected to death, but I keep thinking "What the hell is this kid gonna do with this chick if it actually does survive the next few weeks and grows up?  Are his parents gonna be cool with having a full-grown CHICKEN running around their little high-rise apartment?"  This must happen once in a while - the baby animal survives into adulthood.  Do they still keep it as a pet or do they give it away, or...cook it for dinner?  I have no idea, but am nervous to find out...

      So today I was introduced to the full-length video and lyrics of the song that the kids are going to be doing the choreographed dance to...and it was NOT what I was expecting!  I was expecting some upbeat, energetic fun well-known pop song.  Is that what the kids are going to be dancing to?  Nope, it's not only a slow cheesy ballad, but it's a  Christian pop ballad!!!   Yep, the song is called "Power Of Your Love" and it's totally for kids who are 'all about the Lord.'  A big disappointment!  What a let down after the fun we've been having with Westlife!  I sorta float in between atheism and agnostism, and on a good day you might catch me labelling myself as 'openly spirtitual', in other words I often gain my strength from my faith in the power of the universe, but this is definitely non-denominational, and more vague than anything.  My 'spirituality' could be a whole essay of a blog entry, but I won't go there today.    So we've been practicing the song in class, several times over and over, and each time I have to speak each line of the song to my kids, who repeat it back to me, so that they become familiar with the phonics of all the lyrics before actually having to sing it alone themselves.  I cringe inside every time I have to do it.  I'm not a Christian and definitely don't enjoy having to sing about 'my love for God', but this is part of my job so I just swallow my own pride and silly complicated pretenses and pretend to be enthusiastic about it.  It's not so much the song that bothers me, it's the fact that the whole class is having to sing a Christian song in school that makes me uncomfortable.  No, the school that I teach at is not Catholic or religious by any means, so there's no explanation there.  I just don't like the assumption that is made that all the students are Christian and that all will be okay with singing a Christian song.  Yes, there are a lot of Christians in Korea (according to my Lonely Planet about 25% of the population is, but from my experiences so far I'd say it's actually much closer to 50%) but anyways the point is that not all Koreans are Christian.  I'm trying not to be judgemental or over-critical or sensitive about this but it's been difficult for me.  I grew up in Canada, and can actually remember when the mandatory recital of The Lord's Prayer was removed from our elementary school routine.  I don't know if this event occurred simultaneously across all of Canada or maybe was just a Lakehead Board of Education decision, but I remember feeling quite happy in school when we no longer had to say it every single morning.  I assumed that this decision was made in order to be sensitive to children who came from families of other religions.  Canada, unlike Korea, is a multi-cultural society with families from every religion one can imagine live together in our cities - Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, the list goes on and on...  It's no longer considered PC (politically-correct) in Canada to force religion down the throats of children in public schools, and I'm proud that I'm from a nation that respects (and encourages) this beautiful diversity.  Korea is one of the most uni-cultural countries in the world - you'd be hard-pressed to find another nation where the vast majority of the population thinks/acts/believes all the same things.  (No I'm not saying they're all clones of each other, but you get the point.)  Korea's society, at times, really seems like it lives in a bubble, impervious to cultural influence from the outside world.  I've always been a big supporter of the separation between church and state.  I don't believe that religion belongs in the classrooms of public schools - that's why you have specifically Catholic schools! (and other religions too.)  This way, if you choose, you can send your child to an institution where they will receive their education in a religious environment exactly as you see appropriate.  Now here comes the catch - technically REI is not a public school - it's actually a private business, well a school in a larger chain of REI's all across Korea.  So I guess, in theory, the owners/CEO's/Head Director Dudes of REI can choose any curriculam that they see fit for educating the young minds of their students/customers.  However, in my theory, since REI is not specifically labelled or advertised as a "Christian School", then religion should not belong anywhere in our classroom.  A discussion of ideas regarding various religions would certainly be appropriate and rather educational and enjoyable, I think, but not making all your students sing a song praising the head deity of a specific religion.  But, again, that's just my own personal politically-correct, left-leaning, critical-thinking, over-sensitive opinion.

      Oh us humans are a silly species...  We drink ourselves silly for no logical reason whatsover, wake up the following morning feeling like we've been runover by a bulldozer - 12 times over - and swear that we'll never drink again, only to 'forget' about our promise to ourselves, and repeat the whole damn thing over a few weeks later (or a few days in some people's cases!) ... how we've lasted this long on this planet without killing ourselves off via hangovers is a miracle in itself!    I woke up today at Gavin's with a bitch of a headache and feeling sore ALL OVER (a combination of yesterday's aggressive yoga, many hours of dancing, and sleeping on a paper thin mat on a hard bedroom floor...ugh!)  I got to meet Gavin's really cool roomie though, Ryan, and he nursed me back to health with chamomile tea....yum!  :-)  We all just hung out and chatted for a while, and then I headed back to Shihung.  I was doing completely fine on the trains and all and was almost home when all of a sudden it just got *really* crowded and REALLY HOT on the train and I knew I was gonna pass out if I didn't either sit down or get off the train *immediately*.  Being that the train was packed, my only option was to get off at an earlier stop, get some fresh air, and peel off some layers.  It was so warm today!  Has spring finally sprung?  (or is this sweatiness just a result of my stupid self-inflicted dehyration?)  Whatever...I was glad to get home and relax.  Actually, I didn't even relax.  For some strange reason whenever I'm hung over I seem to *really enjoy* doing housework.  I have no idea why, it makes absolutely no sense at all, but I always do the most cleaning in my apartment the morning after I've had a few too many drinks.  So I did laundry and washed all my dishes and cleaned my kitchen - what a productive boy I was!  ;-)  So, onto a new topic...  I see a lot of reminders about September 11th all the time here, or mostly, just images of the Twin Towers, which automatically makes me think "Oh my god!  September 11th!  They're gone!!!"  In fact, I see the World Trade Centre every single Monday to Friday.  At the top of the stairs, when I'm walking into work, is a poster for REI.  Well my school and the staircase leading there is full of REI posters, but this one stands out.  Being that the name of my school is REI:  American  Language School it's no surprise that my school is full of American imagery - the stars and stripes, The Statue of Liberty, and lots of posters of happy-faced white kids embraced with equally-happy-faced Korean kids.  However, at the top of this stairs is this one poster that you just can't miss - a young Korean boy and girl standing next to a Caucasian male and female teacher and a Korean male 'director(?)'...and rising up behind them is the skyline of Lower Manhattan....Twin Towers front and centre of the poster.  It catches my eye every single day and is a constant reminder of something that is no longer there.  Whether this is just an outdated poster or what, I'm not sure, cause obviously the Koreans are aware of the Towers' demise.  The REI poster is excusable, but I often see another reminder of the Twin Towers that I find puzzling and inexplicable.  At one of the subway stations I use frequently to transfer lines, there is a large, bright poster for one of Korea's major banks.  The bulk of this poster is the face of the Statue of Liberty, staring out over the harbour, but in behind her, in fully clear and obvious view, again, is the WTC rising high out above the forest of New York skyscrapers.  Now this is a modern, contemporary, RECENT poster released by the bank.  It's not outdated (ie: printed before September 11, 2001) so I'm definitely confused as to why the graphic designers/big bank marketing team decided to place such a controversial image in their ad campaign.    Now don't get me wrong - I'm not 'bothered' or 'disturbed' or 'upset' by it.  I'm not one of those ridiculously over-sensitive people who thinks that we should outlaw and erase every single image of the Twin Towers that exists so that we don't 'offend' Americans or whoever might freak out by seeing a photo of the late New York icons.  I'm just puzzled as to why the Koreans continue to place these well-recognized towers in contemporary media.  They're obviously aware that they're gone - do they just not care or maybe they want to 'always remember' or maybe they're just using them because they  are  a well-recognized American icon that they (whatever particular company is using them in their ad) want to associate their product with American ideologies?  (I'm assuming that these 'ideologies' would be freedom, power, and an obsession with consumption?)  It's an excellent example, anyways, of proof that the events surrounding September 11th affected different nations in varying ways.  I'm coming from North America where that day made our world completely stop and has affected mass culture so much.  Obviously it had a much lesser effect on Korean popular culture.  I mean, you would NEVER see CIBC or Bank of America come out with a poster like that - Oh My God could you imagine the screams of complaints that would flow in???  Later that night before going to bed I was just channel -urfing and came across Die Hard 2.  I remember watching this movie over and over years ago and absolutely loving it.  It was like one of my faves for such a long time, no surprise given the fact that I've always had a penchant for action movies containing scenes of mass destruction and plane disasters.  Anyways watching it again tonight I realized how....lame and cheesy (like in a bad way - the lines in this movie really are terrible) and OUTDATED this movie is!!!  It's set circa 1993 and in the movie they're talking about the 'amazing wonders' of 'incredibly advanced technology' such as cell phones (the size of large blocks of cheddar) and fax machines and computers that look to weigh about 67 pounds each!  Anyways this movie reminded me again of September 11th, cause in the movie Dulles Int'l Airport is  completely taken over  about as easily as it would be for me to overtake a 6-year old's lemonade stand!  SO MANY things happen in that movie that made me shout out to the TV "That would SO NEVER be able to happen now!!!" given the current state of obsessive security, tight restrictions, and military-like grip the government has over America's major airports and airlines.  Yes, Die Hard 2 is just a cheesy meaningless action flick that was completely unrealistic, even for 1993, but even then it just goes to show how much things have changed in just ten short years in our world...

      Ahhh the weekend - gotta love it!  I had a full agenda for today, but almost all of my 'scheduled appointments' would be completely changed by the end of the day!  I was supposed to hang out in the afternoon with this guy James - a friend of my friend Joanne back in Canada - who was gonna show me around Shihung a bit - but alas, he had been out partying the night before and slept in too late.  No wories, this gave me a free afternoon to relax at home, catch up on email, and just chill out.  Today's events definitely had a theme (totally coincidental as well) - DANCE!  4pm came round and I was due at REI for some interesting events - be prepared to laugh at me!  ;-)  Apparently in addition to performing My Love and Uptown Girl at an upcoming recital in May, the elementary classes will also be doing a choreographed dance routine!  This will be absolutely hilarious I'm sure!   Between all the singing and now dancing, I'm uncertain these days as to whether my boss is more interested in teaching these kids English, or preparing them for Korean Idol!  Hell, between all the miming and the singing and the dancing and other stunts I've performed for the kids I feel like  I  could apply for Fame Academy now!!  I make fun of it but I must admit that I actually kinda like it - it beats just reading out of a textbook everyday!  So we were meeting up with a 'Jazz Dance Instructor' at 4pm who was gonna teach the kids the dance routine (which I have yet to even see.)  The dancing is for the kids only, but the instructor encouraged me (and Susan) to join in to help encourage the kids.  The first half hour proved to be a pretty rigorous yoga session to get everyone all stretched out and used to moving a certain way.  This proved to be especially challenging and embarrassing for me as I am *NOT* flexible at all!  So here I am, in a room with 15 7-10 year olds who have absolutely no problem touching their toes, or bending themselves into some contorted pretzel, or whatever acrobatic position the jazz instructor wanted them to be in, while I struggle helplessly to bend and twist and keep up with the rest of them.  It's not fair!  What 8-year old can't touch their toes? - I'd like to see these kids try it when they're 25 and 6'3" - it's a long ways down to my toes!!!  :-)  Anyways I provided much comedic relief for the kids who giggled and laughed while watching the instructor trying to guide and physically push me into whatever masochistic tantric position she was trying to get me into!!!  The last half hour was much more fun.  The instructor (who looks like a Korean Debbie Gibson by the way - giant poofy hair and all) put on this really cheesy tape of pop songs from the 90's to get us motivated and energized.  We practiced various moves of jumping and bending and shaking our booties and doing these really campy sharp head turns to make our hair flip back and forth.  (Is this the kind of training that Britney Spears had to go through?)  She taught us some ballet moves too - the whole 'pliet' thing (incorrectly spelled, I know) and moving our arms around while standing on our tippy-toes.  I didn't do very well at this portion either, but hey it was still fun.  After the dance session was over, I hopped onto the subway and headed into the city.  Brad has phoned me the day before and had invited me to attend a breakdancing competition that was happening at one of the Olympic stadiums in Seoul.  He was going with Andrea, Steve, and Amy and I thought it would be fun to tag along and check it out!  I tried phoning Brad's cell to find out the exact stadium and when approximately they were all gonna be down there, but there was no answer...hmmm....    So Seoul's Olympic stadiums are split into two different parks, about a few kilometres from each other, and each park has at least 5 or 6 stadiums.  Not knowing which park nor which stadium was holding the breakdancing event, I picked the park that has "The Olympic Stadium" - the massive stadium that held the opening and closing ceremonies when Seoul hosted the Summer Olympics in 88 (?)  I tried to phone Brad again but still no answer.  I walked out to the stadiums, hoping that I would just be able to find the event by walking around, but the park was dark and empty.  It's a massive park and each stadium is so large it takes like 15 minutes just to walk from one to the other...I wandered in search of my friends, but alas, there was no Brad, no breakdancing to be found!  I was obviously at the wrong park, but at this point it was dark and late and I didn't feel like wandering around the other Olympic Park so I just threw in the towel!  No breakdancing for me that night!  Instead I took the train to Itaewon to have some dinner, and then meet up with a few friends for drinks.  I met up with my friend Gavin - an English Teacher from Wales that I chatted with online a few times before coming to Korea.  He was really nice and introduced to me to some other British teacher-friends of his, including his friend Debbie who is an absolute riot, as well as a bunch of Korean buddies.  We all had a great night having drinks at the various lounges, and then doing some serious dancing at the nearby clubs!  Everyone was in great spirits and more than a little drunk, so we had our own dance competition in one of the clubs while grooving along to "Dirrty" and "Lade Marmelade"!  Good cheesy fun!!!  We ended up partying until 4am and at that point I was definitely crashing and was all danced out.  We crashed at Gavin's friend Ryan's place and I went to sleep, with Christina, Britney, and Madonna dancing in my head...

      Today was a fairly relaxed and mellow day at work - quite enjoyable indeed!  It was also a special day at work because it was the birthday of one of my students.  Lina, one of my kindergartens, turned six today.  So, the school had prepared a little celebration in her honour that the whole class got to participate in.  They had bought her a birthday cake and even a present!  All the kindergartens gathered around to sing 'Happy Birthday' to her, and then they all had to leave except for her class who got to stay and enjoy the cake (including me!)  No teaching today, no lessons - just a chance to sit and eat cake and watch the kids play!  I thought it was really sweet that my boss and the other teachers made such a big deal for Lina!  Assuming they do this for every student, there'll be another 15 or so birthday parties like this coming in the next year!  Fine by me!!!  It's always great to have a big fuss made when you're little and it's your birthday.  Hell, it's great to have a big fuss made when you're 25 and it's your birthday!  :-)  I remember back when I was in elementary school that all the students always got 'birthday bumps' in class from the teacher on the day that it was their birthday.  (for those of you who aren't familiar with birthday bumps, they're little 'fun spankings' given to the birthday boy/girl on the teacher's lap on their birthday - one 'bump' for every year they are old.  The birthday boy/girl 'reluctantly' gets spanked - even though they actually love the attention and are laughing the whole time - while the rest of the class screams out in ecstacy and dances around at watching one of their peers get spanked!)  This was always a very fun and exciting spectacle for all the students - not just the one whose birthday it was.  (side note: I wonder if schools still do this?  I would imagine that we've gotten so 'politically-correct' and paranoid about touching students, unfortunately, that this time-honoured tradition is probably no longer allowed.  Quite sad actually, as it was something that all students looked forward to having.)    Anyways my birthday is in August, when school is out for the summer, so I never got to experience the birthday bumps in school.  I remember being so sad about this!  Every time it was a student's birthday in class and they got the bumps, I was always a bit saddened by it cause I knew I was never going to have my turn.  Ahhh well - 'suck it up, Scott!' you say, but hey it was quite tragic for a young innocent sweet 6-year old like me!  Was the birthday bumps just a Sherbrooke or Thunder Bay phenomenon?  Did other children in other schools in other cities get to enjoy the same rite of passage?  I'm quite curious...

      It's really interesting how names work here in Korea.  When someone introduces themselves, they always give their last name first.  Last names are always one syllable only, and first names are always two names hypenated together.  For example, my boss' name is Park Jonge-Oh, and his daughters are Park Yae-Na and Park Yae-Lin.  Apparently close to 40% of Koreans have either their last name as Lee, Park or Kim!!!  (Side note: when searching for potential partners, its considered inappropriate to marry someone with the same last name, even if they're not related to you.  This makes the 'dating pool' really small for people with one of those names!  Also, married women keep their maiden names for life - I think that's cool!)  Now when it comes to their English names, that's a whole different story!  Many Koreans have an English name, on top of their real Korean name.  They either get to pick their own English name themselves (which I think would be fun - imagine how cool it would be if you could just pick any name for yourself?), or if they're young like the kids I teach, their names are picked for them by either their parents or their teacher.  Almost all of my students have an English name, and this has made it a lot easier for me to learn everyone's name.  I've always been really good at remembering people's names, and so far this has held up quite well at work.  When I first started teaching I had like thirty names of kids to remember, and so far I have done quite well with this.  In the past I've most often used physical appearances to remember people's names (ie: hair colour, eye colour, height, weight, etc.) but that hasn't been very useful here in Korea!  (all my kids have black hair and brown eyes!  haha!)    It's kinda funny, some of the names that their parents choose for their kids.  A lot of times they will just pick an English word that 'sounds nice' to give to their kids as their English name.  Consequently, I have students with names like Cherry, Candy, and Grapes (food seems to be a popular theme...)  and have heard of other teachers with student names like Apple, Ferry, and Cloudy.  The problem with English names arise when the kids are quite young, like still in their kindergarten years.  At this stage in their lives they have not had an English name very long, so a lot of time you call out to them but they don't respond just because they're simply not used to being addressed with that name.  Also, their parents can sometimes change their names on a whim if they feel like 'picking a better name' for their child.  This has proved to be rather confusing for me when all of a sudden a student I've known for a month suddenly has a new name!  A few examples - Mini became Lina, Thomas became Daniel, etc.  I have one new student who just started this week and he's had a different name almost every day this week!  On Monday he was Peter, on Wednesday he was Joseph, and today he was Tom.  Who knows what he'll be tomorrow?  If you're curious as to how I'm addressed at work, well I thought that it was going to be "Mr. Erdman" as it would have been most likely if I was teaching in North America, but our school seems to be fairly casual about that sorta thing.  I am addressed by either "Teacher", "Scott", or most often " Scott-Teacher " which I think is rather cute!  I guess it's about as self-explanatory as it can get - it's both my personal name and my relation to the students all wrapped into one name that can be shouted out loudly at their leisure.  It was a little strange at first, but I actually quite like it now.  :-)

      "I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien, I'm an Englishman in New York." ~Sting  Ummm....no Sting....actually  I'm  a  Canadian in Seoul , but yes I am a legal alien.    Today was a big step in getting closer to finishing all the necessary Korean bureaucracies for me to have a 'normal' life here, as a foreigner.  Steven took me down to the Incheon Immigration Office and I filled out all the paperwork so that I can receive my Alien Registration Card.  This card is very important, as it allows me to open a bank account, counts as official residency status, and helps keep the Korean immigration officials from kicking me out after 90 days here in town!  I won't actually get the card until next week, but I was approved and everything went through and it was a big relief to have that taken care of.  One less hoop to jump through...  It can be a bit tricky living in a foreign country, with all the rules and bureaucracies surrounding immigration and work visas and passports and taxation laws and all that other fun stuff, but I always remind myself that I'm certainly not the first Canadian guy to come over and teach English here, so there is always a way around whatever 'roadblocks' come along.  It's kinda fun though to say "Hi, I'm Scott, I'm an alien!" and be completely telling the truth!  (cause I have the identification to back it up!  haha!)  I was invited up for a big family dinner with the Parks tonight.  Today was the four year anniversary of Steven's father's passing, so him and all his relatives always get together on this day to remember him.  I got to meet his siblings and nephews and nieces and many other relatives which was really cool, but it was on such sad terms.  When I came up for dinner they had just started their praying (they're a very Christian family) and everyone was just so sad, you could *feel* the mourning in the room....  They read from their bibles and sang a few songs, and most of them were crying by the end of it.  I felt a little awkward being right in the middle, not knowing what they were saying, and feeling a little uncomfortable with all the open emotion around me.  At the same time though I felt honoured for being there, because this was obviously a very personal, important family affair and just the fact that I was invited to participate shows how welcoming this family is.    After the prayer session dinner was served, and the mood lightened up tremendously.  That awkward silence that was just hanging in the room was broken as people began to engage in 'everyday' conversations again, and I was formally introduced to all the family.  Only two other relatives spoke English, but they were all very friendly to me.  Dinner was delicious (more chicken - yah!) and the family was very curious to hear about what I thought about Korea, what life was like in Canada, and what my own personal interests and hobbies are.  One of the relatives was Steven's 16-year old nephew and he was very friendly to me.  His English is quite good actually and I enjoyed talking to him about music, sports, the weather, and a variety of other topics.  He plays drums at his church during ceremonies, and I was invited to watch him perform this Sunday at his church.  I'm not religious by any means, and normally feel uncomfortable in church settings, but I think it would be cool to go and check it out and see him 'do his thing' with the drums.  I'll let you know how all that pans out!

      My whole point with this blog has been to observe and experience as much as I can.  I try to be as open-minded as possible and to avoid judgement.  I often make comparisons, but that's only human nature, and I don't think it can be avoided (there is not hot if you don't know what cold is, or as the Koreans firmly believe, there is no ying without the yang.)  I think a balance of views is important as well, so here is a list of things that I've noticed with Korea that are less than pleasant.  1) Pollution - Korea is a stunningly beautiful country, but, at times, the Koreans do not treat their landscapes very well.  Pollution in the form of smoggy air, litter all over the place, piles of garbage in random places, and especially with polluted waterways has been very evident.  Korea has experienced rapid industrial development in the last few decades, and I think that this has been the unfortunate side effect.  Economic gains in exchange for Mother Nature's pains.  The Han River, for example, is absolutely disgusting in places and you would never want to swim in it.  And most creek or smaller river that I have seen has appeared to double as a garbage dump for locals.  It's quite sad actually.  I've also recently found out that Bukhansan National Park (where I was hiking just his past weekend) is about to become under threat by some new developments.  A massive ring road freeway is currently under construction, being built to circumnavigate Metro Seoul.  Unfortunately, a section of this ring road is slated to go right through the middle of Bukhansan.  It will be terribly sad if this does in fact go through because it's such a beautiful park and it would be a shame to have its peace and solitute destroyed by this highway.  Let's hope they decide to either move the highway to outside park boundaries, or tunnel through the park instead.  2) Political Instability - You may have already heard this, but just last week Korea's President was impeached by his own parliament.  I'm not even certain of the details of this, or why it happened, but apparently this is a fairly common thing here?  Political parties and leaders seem to come and go like the wind, and the media is constantly filled with stories of  Scandal!  and  Corruption!  with the Korean government.  It has apparently been very frustrating for Koreans as, at times, the political future of their nation can be very uncertain, and national economic/social/political/environmental policies seem to come and go, depending on who happens to be in power at the moment.  Here's hoping that the Koreans get the stability that they so strongly wish for in the near future.  3)  Drivers!  OMG are Korean drivers insane!!!  haha!  I remember reading in my Lonely Planet: Seoul book before coming over here that Korea is, in general, a very safe country, but that the greatest risk to a person was in crossing the street.  I thought that the author was just being sarcastic, but it really is the truth!  Korean drivers really are quite crazy, and I feel fairly confident in saying that local traffic rules and regulations are 'mere suggestions' rather than laws!  Speed limits are rarely adhered to, nobody ever signals, people will drive into oncoming traffic to pass other drivers, they'll park just about anywhere they damn well feel like it, and 'pedestrian-only' zones are only a dream!  I've seen vehicles driving in places that you just can't imagine - apparently some people prefer not to use the road here?  They can't be blamed entirely though - Seoul has seen a massive population explosion in recent decades, and as a result the number of vehicles on the road has increased exponentially.  They're building roads and bridges and highways at a frantic pace, but infrastructure development for the private automobile just can't keep up with growth.  I guess this ginormous increase in traffic has caused the locals to use 'creative driving methods' to get from A to B.  Either way, crossing the street can be very dangerous here as drivers will often go through red lights without skipping a beat, or drive right over pedestrian crosswalks if they don't feel like waiting.  I've certainly learned to look both ways,  several times , before crossing the street here.  No day-dreaming while using the crosswalks here, that's for sure!

      So I can't believe that I've been here a month already!!!  Wow!!!  That first week here was soooooo long and now 4 have flown by!  One month down, only eleven more to go?  Man this year is gonna go by so fast!  I definitely gotta make the most of it...especially now that the weather has warmed up a bit and we've all defrosted from the weeks of cold weather that we had.  Bring on spring I say!  So I've been able to make a lot of observations while I've been here in Korea.  I've been doing a lot of comparing between Canada and Korea and have come up with some interesting questions/points to ponder/curiosities.  I love my home country so much, and do miss it quite a bit, but there's a few things about life in Canada that I never really noticed until I came here.  And they're not very pleasant.  Here's some food for thought:  1) Obesity - I've read a thousand studies and heard a million times in the media about how North Americans are alarmingly overweight, and how the percentage of obese persons in Canada and the USA has just skyrocketed over the last few decades, but I never really paid attention much to it.  Now that I've been here in Korea a month, I've really noticed it.  The amount of overweight people that I've seen in Korea I can count on one or two hands.  Why is that?  Do the Koreans have a healthier diet or lifestyle than we do?  Do they eat less fast food?  Do they just have really good genes that predispose them to slimmer waistlines?  I'm really curious about this, because Koreans are like Canadians in that the majority of them live in cities, eat out a lot, and don't often get a lot of exercise (or so I've been told, I could be wrong) so why is there such a sharp difference?  2) Homelessness - Now this is something that I definitely noticed while living in Vancouver (a city notorious for its problems with homelessness.)  I don't think I have seen a single homeless person at all anywhere here in Seoul.  In a city of 20 million you'd think there would be THOUSANDS, as all the major North American cities seem to be a magnet for homeless people.  Why not here in Korea?  Do they not have any?  Or are they just really well-hidden?  Do they have better social nets that protect people from having to live on the streets here?  Do all the would-be homeless people just live with their relatives in those common multi-generation family homes?  Again, a question in which I don't have any answers, but it was something that I was really surprised about here in Korea.    3) Transit - It is SO WONDERFUL to live in a city that has an efficient (and inexpensive) transit system.  Seoul's subway system has eleven lines with hundreds of stations, stretching across hundreds of kilometres across this gigantic metropolis.  Busses run absolutely everywhere here, and I've never had to wait longer than 2 minutes (during the day) for a bus.  And several more new subway lines are being constructed/planned to connect even more neighbourhoods of the city.  Add on a high-speed express subway that will connect the airport to downtown, opening in 2006, (sound familiar?  can we say RAV line?) and you have the makings of an excellent and thorough transit system.  And the best part is, to ride from end of the city of the other (which would take at least 3-4 hours cause it's so damn big) would never cost me more than about $1.50 CDN.  WOW!  I don't know if mass transit and infrastructure in Korea comes under municipal, provincial, or federal responsibility, but whoever is running (and building it) is doing a fantastic job! (now if only it was open a little later...oh well.)  Either way, as an urban planning student, it's thrilling to be in a city where transit is so efficient and so...massive.  In Vancouver people scream and whine about not wanting more rapid transit lines in the city, because 'the construction will disrupt my lovely 3-hour morning commute to work and might make the road too bumpy causing me to spill my soy latte' or 'why are we wasting our taxpayers dollars on rapid transit that only the riff-raff will use - I'm rich and love my suburban cul-de-sac monster home and am addicted to my gas-guzzling SUV! I want more roads - lets build more freeways!'  Meanwhile, our governments bicker back and forth about who's going to pay for these lines that should have been built 30 years ago.  Toronto and Montreal have similar woes with their transit system - the need is there, but where is the money for it?  Canada really needs to do some major reprioritizing when it comes to how it manages and constructs mass urban transit.    Anyways, there's a lot more that I could go on and rant and rave about, but I think that's good enough for now.  (And besides, I get too dizzy if I stand up on my soapbox for too long...hehe!  But I must admit the view *is* awfully nice from way up here...)  Expect sequels on this kind of stuff in the future, and 'A Critical Eye On Korea' in tomorrow's edition of the internationally renowned S2H World Tour blog.  :-)

      Today was Day Two of 'the best weekend ever in Korea.'  Brad and I slept in fairly late, and then Andrea, Steve, and their other friend Pauline came by (Amy had other plans.)  The five of us decided to go for a little hike so we got our day-bags packed up and took the bus to Bukhansan National Park.  Seoul is blessed enough to be surrounded by some pretty spectacular mountains, most of which are contained in several stunning national and provincial parks.  Bukhansan is one of the larger parks and is located right inbetween Ilsandong and the city centre.  Hiking is very popular in Korea, and so the parks are unbelievably packed with hikers on the weekends.    This particular Sunday was very busy, but not nearly as bad as it could be (or so I'm told.)  Bukhansan is an amazing park - stunning jagged brown-coloured granite peaks rising high above forested valleys, with incredible views of the sprawling city below.  We chose a shorter hike that was took us on a less-popular trail only part-way up the mountain.  At the top of this trail is a small Buddhist temple with a very large statue of Buddha, arms gesturing out towards the city way in the distance.  It was a little strange to see a large Buddha statue in the middle of a forest on a mountain, but hey we're in Asia right?  We contined on past Buddha and came to these smooth, bare granite slopes.  We sat and rested and enjoyed the view - stunning jagged peaks, a thick forest of Asian pine trees, the Buddhist temple off to our left poking out between the trees, and we could even hear the sound of Buddhist monks chanting from down below in the valley...  An absolutely amazing moment and it just felt about as perfectly 'Asian' as a moment could be.    We walked around on the slopes for a while, which was a strange experience in itself...  The slopes are at least a 45-degree angle, but the surface is very rough (almost like sandpaper) and so your boots stick to it - a perfect friction allowing you to walk up, down, and across these crazy slopes with ease- it was like defying gravity!  More silly photos on the slopes naturally ensued.  After that we meandered back down to the valley below, where we sat in a dry riverbed and had another picnic lunch.  A warm beautiful day in a spectacular setting!  It's wonderful to have such an oasis of nature right next to such a busy and chaotic megacity.  It was late afternoon at this point, and Brad, Andrea, and Pauline were feeling tired so they decided to head back home.  Steve and I were still feeling energetic so we headed back into Seoul to check out some more sights.  We made a b-line back to Gonjeongjong Palace, and made it in time before it closed.  This turned out to be probably the most amazing part of my weekend.  This palace is so stunning and incredible and mystifying it's hard to describe in words...  It's a gigantic ancient palace located right in the heart of Seoul - a many-century old royal home surrounded by modern-day crazy-shaped skyscrapers with neon and giant big-screen TV's the sizes of houses hanging off them - such a strange juxtaposition!    Like most of Korea's great monuments, this palace was partially destroyed by the Japanese when they invaded, (some from wars with Japan centuries ago, and some burned during the more-recent Korean War) but has since been rebuilt and restored.  Walking through the palace grounds really does feel like stepping back into time.  The buildings are so large and so graceful - massive curved, peaked rooves, with the underlying wooden supports painted in the most ornate and vivid colours that you can imagine.  The courtyards are made up of perfectly crafted stones, and there are gardens, ponds, moats, giant rock pillars, trees, and statues spread out amongst the perfectly-designed grounds.  Every single building and tree and pond in this whole complex (the size of a small town) were laid down following the rules of geomancy, to harness the flow of the universe, and just to walk through them is like a spiritual experience in itself.  Absolutely breaktaking!  It was one of the moments that I wish I could snap my fingers and have all my family and friends from back home right there with me.  You guys would have absolutely loved this - you would have been blown away with the beauty of this ancient palace and I wish I could have shared that moment with you all.  I took several photos and will pass them along when I get them developed, but believe me when I say that they won't do it justice!  I AM SO LUCKY TO BE HERE IN KOREA SEEING SUCH INCREDIBLE SIGHTS!!!  I'll never forget it as long as I live.  And what's even more amazing is that there's supposed to be like another three or four other ancient royal palaces in Seoul, just as amazing as this one.  I can't wait to see those ones!!!  After Gonjeongjong Palace Steve took me over to Insadong - this is a very popular street in Seoul where locals and tourists come to browse through hundreds of stores selling uniquely Korean crafts and artwork.  There are stores selling paper products, lanterns, candles, statues, tea sets, clothing, and all other kinds of beautiful art and crafts hand-made my Koreans.  It's the kind of place where one could spend a whole day just wandering and browsing.  It's definitely where I'll find the cool gifts to send friends and family back home a little piece of Korea!  Steve and I took a break in one of Insadong's famous tea shops - these little hideaway cafes that sell only tea, but the most unique and rich flavours in a beautiful ambience.  We both had 'jujube tea' which was made from dates - hard to explain, but very warm and so tasty.  Mmmmmm.....  After that it was quite late and Steve had to be getting home so he ventured off to catch the bus while I explored around a little more.  I had some dinner and then was excited when I came across Musicland - one of the largest music stores in Korea and one of the places that I had been searching for last week when I failed to find Tower Records (which I found out has actually closed!  No wonder I couldn't find it!)  I browsed through Musicland and ended up buying myself a CD - Travis'  The Invisible Band  and man is it ever good!    I'm sitting at home listening to it now and just recounting all the great times I had this weekend.  I was only gone one night but it felt like I was gone for several days!  Well I guess with all the stuff we packed in - prison tours, hiking in national parks, dinners out, long rides on busses and the subway, shopping in Insandong, browsing through massive bookstores, silly random photos, and of course The Gun Of Love, it's no wonder!  It was definitely my best weekend yet in Korea and I had so much fun and got to see so much!  There's so much to explore in this country!!!  Korea offers such a wide variety of activities, I don't think I'll ever run out of things to discover here.  I really am lucky to have such a great opportunity to really see  so much  of a foreign country - I am feeling particularly blessed these days.  And I don't ever want to take a minute of this experience for granted.  (please kick me if I do!)  :-)

      I just had the best weekend ever!!!!!  I LOVE KOREA!!!!!!!!  :-)  I got up early on Saturday morning to pack up my overnight bag and make the great trek over to Brad's place.  Brad lives in just about the furthest place in Seoul from me.  I live in the SW corner, and he lives in the NW corner, but he lives at the very end of the one of the longest subway lines in the city and it took FOREVER to get to his place!  All the subway lines lead into the central city so I actually had to travel *away* from him for a while before getting on the line that goes to his neighbourhood.  Two hours, four trains, and 32 stops later, I arrived in Ilsandong - the 'new town' that Brad lives in.    It was really cool to see Brad after so many years.  I actually saw him once, about two years ago, at Coyote's bar in Thunder Bay, but it was loud and dark and I didn't really get the chance to talk to him that night.  So, in essence, this was really the first time I've seen him since high school.  Brad is still good ol' Brad - laid-back, relaxed, easy-going, and probably the most amazing artist that I have ever met in my life.  We hung out at his place and caught up on what we had each been doing since high school - wow has six and a half years just *flown* by....!  A few of his friends came by later, and I got to meet Andrea, Amy, and Steve.  All of them are Canadian English teachers from various cities across Canada and work at the same school.  Even stranger, Brad, Andrea, and Steve all went to Lakehead University!  It was SO WEIRD to sit and talk about Thunder Bay with people who had actually lived there at some point...rather surreal.  It's a small, small world I tell ya!  The five of us decided to head back into the city to play tourist for a while.  Brad, Andrea, Amy, and Steve are by far the nicest, coolest people that I've met so far in Korea.  They've all been here quite a while and not only are a blast to hang out with, but really know their way around town as well!  We decided to go and check out Soedaemun Prison, located in Seoul's Independence Park.  Soedaemun was the prison where all the Korean freedom fighters were locked away, and often tortured and killed, during the Japanese occupation of Korea.  Much of it was torn down after Korea regained independence, but a few key buildings still remain, and a few others have been restored.  It was a fascinating, yet very somber, place to visit.  We got to visit the massive buildings that contained row after row of prison cells, saw a few underground cells where the females were locked away in darkness, and a special house where all the prisoners with leprosy and other incurable diseases were locked away to rot.  Many of the cells were specifically designed so that a person could only stand up perfectly straight and not move at all (like a vertical coffin...) and even the 'larger' cells were so tiny that the prisoners could not even stand up or lie down.  They even had a building just for where they tortured prisoners, and this museum has re-created many of these methods with explicit models and displays.  Very morbid, very dark and eerie, and very sobering.  It was really interesting to see such a vivid piece of Korean history and we all learned a lot about that horrible period in Korea's history.   During most of our wandering around the prison grounds we were split in two groups.  Amy and I ventured off together and came across some very friendly Koreans.  The first time was right outside the Lepers' House (during which time I could not get Nana's "Leprosy Song" out of my head...thanks a lot Nana!!!)  There were four of them and they were very excited when they saw us foreigners.  They asked if they could have their photo taken with us and Amy and I had no qualms about it.  Later on, in the main prison cell building, we ran into them again.  They were even more excited to see us a second time, and asked again if they could have their picture taken with us.  This time though, they asked us to do a specific pose, and this is when Amy and I were introduced to "the gun of love!"  One of the Korean girls asked us to stand in this particular pose, and they showed us exactly how to do it.  The Gun Of Love is a very fun cheesy silly pose where you stand up, but sorta lean back, knees bent a little, and make your hands looks like two guns, pointing out away from you.  "Oh, you mean like in Charlie's Angels?" we asked the Koreans.  "No, it's the gun of love!" they exclaimed, thrilled to have introduced us to something new.  So, Amy and I stood their, fingers pointing out, with the cheesiest facial expressions that we could contort our faces into, while the Koreans surrounded us imitating the pose.  It was absolutely hilarious!    When Amy and I eventually ran into the rest of the gang we jumped out from a corner, pointed our fingers at Brad, Andrea, and Steve in our new favourite pose, and shouted out " The Gun of Love!!!"   Naturally those three had no idea what we were doing and the looks on their faces were priceless!  We explained to them the significance and the history of The Gun Of Love, and that was it - it's been a hit ever since.  All weekend long, all across Seoul, the five of us have been doing The Gun Of Love at random moments in random places.  You gotta love pure and utter silliness!!!  :-)  After Independence Park we ventured over to Genjeongjeon - one of the great massive ancient palaces found right in the heart of Seoul.  Unfortunately it had just closed by the time we arrived, so we wandered around the grounds on the outside of the palace.  Still riding high from our Gun Of Love silliness escapades at the prison, we decided to take several more ultra-cheesy photos outside the palace.  We found a row of five phone booths and these provided a perfect 'stage' for us to perform for the Koreans with our silliness.  Andrea had brought her digital camera and we got some Korean passerby to take the photos for us.  They're absolutely hilarious and Andrea has promised to email them to me sometime soon.  As soon as I get them I'll be sure to let you know and pass them on.  We took a break from our "Monkees-esque" photo shoot by having a picnic of baguette, cheese, oranges, and chocolate on the beautiful palace grounds.  Quite possibly the most beautiful place that I've had a picnic in.  After our little picnic we wandered over to Kyobo Bookstore, which is one of the largest bookstores in Korea.  They have a massive 'foreign' section of the bookstore and the five of us spent a good hour plus just wandering around the store, browsing through the great selection of English books.  Four of us ended up buying books and I'm excited to read my purchases.  I bought two books, both of which were highly reccommended to me by good friends back in Canada.  I bought "The Little Prince" (my dear friend Jaki's absolute most favourite book in the whole wide world) and "Life of Pi" (several friends of mine, including Jin, have told me that this book is amazing.)  I love reading and love buying books - I'll be back at this bookstore again sometime soon for sure.  It was then dark and starting to get cold, so we decided to head back to Ilsandong.  We stopped off at this giant outdoor mall in the city they live in called La Festa and had a very lovely Thai dinner at one of the local restaurants.  After that we went and hung out at their friend Jeremy's high-rise apartment, just chillin' out, enjoying the view of Ilsandong at night from high above the city, and just watching some TV.  We then went back home and Brad and I stayed up late chatting and sharing our own philosophies regarding life, why we came to Korea, and what our future plans are.  Brad's an awesome guy and even though he's only in Korea for another three months I think we'll become really good friends during that time.  His friends are a blast and I look forward to getting to know them too.  Finally - some new friends who are fun, well-rounded, and  normal !!!  hehe!    It was such a good day!  :-)

      My weeks are going by faster and faster these days...this whole week just seemed to fly by, and overall was a very good week.  (albeit rather quiet, but still enjoyable!)  My students have been great (for the most part) and the new curriculam is working out really well in the classrooms.  Still, it's Friday, and I'm happy that the weekend is here!  I really do enjoy teaching all of my classes, with the exception of one...  I teach three blocks of kindergarten in the morning - a block of 5-year olds, a block of 6's, and a block of 7's (each block is a half hour long.)  The kids are shy, adorable and sweet, and the lessons *VERY* simple (ABC's, 123's, colouring, matching objects, puzzles, cut and paste, that kind of stuff.)  The mornings always whip by and then next thing I know it's lunch time.  In the afternoons I teach elementary - a block of Grade 1's, a block of Grade 2's, a block of Grade 3/4's, and a block of Grade 4/5/6's (each block is about 45 minutes long.)  The Grade 2-6's are older and have a much larger vocabulary, so it's fun with them cause you can actually interact with them and play games that are a little more complex.  They're very well-behaved and are naturally inquisitive about me, about learning English, and about the world.  The Grade 1's, on the other hand, are a whole other ball game...they are the only class that I DO NOT enjoy teaching!!!  They're at that  lovely  age where they've lost the shyness that keeps the kindergartens in line, but have yet to learn the respect for elders and teachers that the older kids are so good at following.  They are loud, disruptive, and do not listen at all!  They can never speak to me or each other, everything has to be SCREAMED, they love to throw things, they can't sit in their seat for longer than 2 minutes, and they fight with each other all the time.  Hair-pulling, pinching, and the stealing of precious markers are all daily dramas.  At this age they still know very little English, so speaking/yelling at them is very difficult because they don't understand much of what I say.  This makes it *very easy* for them to tune me out...  All of this would be 'handleable', except for the fact that only is this the only class of the day that I have to teach alone (no Korean teacher on hand to translate to help keep them in line), and this particular class is a FULL HOUR LONG.  It's the longest hour of the day, by far!!!  I have to keep reminding myself during this hour, every single day, what my Auntie always told me - "patience is a virtue!"  MY GOD DOES ONE NEED A LOT OF PATIENCE TO SURVIVE THIS HOUR!!!  Most of the kids in this class are actually quite polite, intelligent, and well-behaved, but there's 2 or 3 that are not, and they seem to enjoy getting the other kids riled up.  Two of them, especially, are extremely disruptive.  One of them is very smart, but I swear he has A.D.D., and honestly has to SCREAM OUT AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS all of his answers.  Even him I can handle...it's this one student in this class that is my biggest challenge. He is extremely rude, never has any interest in his schoolwork, likes to pick on other students (especially his female peers), and is *very defiant* of adult authority.  I can honestly yell at him to stay in his seat (and I hate to raise my voice, but sometimes it's the only way the kids will pay attention) and he'll just look me right in the eye and laugh...  Ohhhh....  Seriously, this kid is going to bring about the end of me.  I try not to let him under my skin, but somedays he just knows exactly what buttons to push.  Today was one of those days...!  I had a splitting headache by the end of that class and tried very hard to not let it ruin the rest of my day, which normally I enjoy very much.  Some kind of solution has to come about with this one god-awful hour from hell because I can't last a whole year being alone with those Grade 1's.  Honestly, if it was any other grade I'd be perfectly able and well-equipped to handle those students.  The easiest solution would be to have a Korean teacher in the class with me, as the Grade 1's seem to respect them a lot more than they do me.  Unforunately, that hour seems to be one of our busiest at the school - I'm pretty sure that all the other teachers are occupied with their own students, and because my boss Steven is so incredibly busy all the time, he's usually attending to some dire matter regarding running the school during that time.  I'm not sure what else to suggest, but I definitely need to talk to my boss about this and work something out.  Let's just say that I have a new, MASSIVE respect for my friends Henry and Jason back in Vancouver, both of whom are teachers who've had entire classrooms of 'difficult problem' children.  I don't know how you guys survive!!!!  ANY SUGGESTIONS???  :-)  This weekend should be awesome and I can't wait!  I got a hold of my friend Brad Harris, who is actually from my hometown, who is teaching here also in Korea.  Him and I went to elementary and high school together, and I remember playing at his house as a child - his house was just two crescents over from mine.  I haven't seen him in YEARS and I think it will be cool to hang out with someone that I knew from when I was a child/teenager.  We hadn't had the chance to hang out prior to this weekend as we pretty much live on opposite corners of Seoul from each other.  I'm going out to the area he lives in tomorrow AM to hang with him and some of his friends, and it'll probably take me at least two hours on the subway to get there, if not more.  Regardless of this on-coming super-commute I'm looking forward to seeing Brad, meeting some new people, and doing something fun (we're debating between going hiking or visiting some museums or galleries or something.)   Should be a great weekend!!!

      So I've been here in Korea for almost a month, and only just recently have I realized that, for many of you, I have not yet explained why I came here to Korea.  It's very important to me that you understand the reasons  why  I decided to uproot my wonderful life in Vancouver to come out here.  So sit back, get comfortable, and be prepared to find out about the things that make Scotty tick...!  ;-)  I am a firm believer in dreams.  I always have been, and always will.   When everyone is a child, they know exactly what they want to do with their life, and have no problem imagining their perfect future.  "What do you want to be when you grow up?" is a question commonly asked to children, and most have absolutely no difficulty answering it.  But then something happens...  I don't know when it is, maybe in our dissillusioned and over-dramatic teen years, or maybe at the onset of 'adult-hood', but at some point in our lives almost everyone abandons their dreams.  All the amazing and crazy and wonderful goals that they set out for themselves as children become pushed aside.  Societal pressures to "Get an education!  Get a job!  Get married!" begin to sink in, and most of us succumb.  Not that this is necessarily a bad thing for everyone - for many people their dream IS to get married and settle down and have children, and I think that's awesome and wonderful.  However, I do believe that a lot of people follow that path because that's what we're told, more like programmed, to do.  We are raised as children to believe that anything in life is possible and that we can grow up to be whatever we can dream of, but as adults we are often scolded or laughed at or looked down on when we dare to stray from the 'straight and narrow' path.  The pressure to be "sensible" and "responsible" is extremely convincing, and so many people fall immediately into the 9-5 routine, and then the next thing you know their life has passed them by, and they look back at all the dreams they set out for themselves, and wonder whatever happened to them...    I don't ever want to regret not pursuing a dream of mine, and that is why I am here in Korea.  There was two things that I've always known, ever since I was a child, that I wanted to do with my life.  One of them was to build cities, and the other was to see the world.  During my teen years by big dream was to move out to Vancouver, get a degree from Simon Fraser University, and live in a high-rise apartment overlooking the ocean.  I feel so blessed and so privileged and so proud that I have been able to accomplish that dream!  I truly am extremely lucky for all the opportunities in life that I have been given (I have myself, my parents, and the fact that I live in a country like Canada to thank for that.)  And so I leave Vancouver not because I was dissatisfied with my life there, or because I was running away from responsibility, or because I was lost or confused or didn't know what to do next with my life.  I left Vancouver because it was time to move on and pursue my next dream - world travel.  I've always imagined and dreamed about what it would be like to experience LIVING in a foreign country.  This is very different from VISITING a foreign country.  As much as I enjoy being a tourist in different countries, I've realized that it's a very different experience from actually living as a resident in another country.  As a tourist, you are very sheltered from the 'real world' of the place that you are visiting.  You fly in, run around the city/island/country for a week or two, take a million photos, visit a few museums and tourist traps, check out a few monuments and landmarks, generally don't interact all that much with locals, and then leave back to your homeland.  I've always likened it to 'voyaging in a plastic bubble'.  I've always believed that in order to  truly  get a feel for what a place is like, you have to experience it as a resident.  The day-to-day life of residents in a foreign country is far different than what a tourist goes through when they visit.  I wanted to be able to say that I lived somewhere other than Canada, got to know what daily life in that land was like, made friends with locals who actually lived there, maybe learned a bit of the language, and just felt like I was part of that community.   That  is my ideal of what travelling should be like.  A lot of people were either very confused or just down right shocked when I told them that I wanted to move overseas to teach English.  "But that's not urban planning, Scott!"  "What does teaching English have to do with your degree, Scott?"  "What about finally getting a *real* job, Scott?"  This is just a sample of the reactions that I heard from many people.  Teaching English is something that I'm good at and thoroughly enjoy, but I'm not here because I wanted to be an English teacher.  Teaching English is, I believe, the best way to pick yourself up, plop down in just about any country you can name, get a job, and actually be able to support and immerse yourself in a new life in a new land.  It is the means for me to accomplish my dream.    And so here I am.  I gave up everything that I worked so hard to achieve in Vancouver, threw caution to the wind, and took the plunge.  Here I am in Korea.  It's crazy and it's chaotic and it's stressful and it's illogical and it's 'not the sensible thing to do in life', but I love it, and I'm so glad I'm here.  It's different and it's unpredictable and it's exhilirating and it's challenging and it's strengthening and it's inspiring and it's amazing every single day.  Even during the moments/days when it's been really hard for me out here, when I've felt lonely or isolated or stressed or confused, I've never ever doubted that this was the right choice for me.  I'm out living my dream of experiencing life in a foreign land, and its even more wonderful than I could have ever fathomed.  All of this is good for gaining 'life experience,' and I will know on the day that I die that I lived out my dreams and dared to be different.  I believe that most of us grow up far too fast in life.  We're barely out of university or college and we're already rushing down the aisle, rushing into the office to sit there for the next forty years, rushing to buy  things  that will supposedly make us happy, and in essence it seems, almost rushing to die...  I am in no rush whatsoever to become an urban planner, because not only do I have faith that someday I will, I know that I don't need to race as fast as I can towards city hall RIGHT NOW in order to accomplish that.  It's not a 'now or never' option!  I've always thought that your 20's should be a decade of discovery and life exploration, and maybe being a little too irresponsible, a little too wild and crazy, and a little too selfish.  When else in life are you ever going to have the chance to do that again?  We have our 30's and our 40's and so on to sit behind a desk and make lots of money and consume products.  Once you achieve a family or a career job or buy property and make it your home you sorta have to grow up and become responsible.  There are things to take care of, and other people that rely on you.  It becomes difficult to leave all that behind once you've gained it, nor does one really want to since I imagine that it's wonderful to have all those things, but I wanted to take the opportunity to go out into the world and be a 'global nomad' before I settled down.  One day I know I will, I just don't want it to be now.  There are several quotations that I've vowed to live my life by, and here's a few that inspire and drive and encourage me every day:  "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the road less travelled, and that has made all the difference."  ~Robert Frost  "The only difference between great people and everyone else is that great people create their lives while everyone else lets life create them." ~Unknown  "One doesn't discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a very long time." ~Unknown  "Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did.  So throw off the bowlines.  Sail away from the safe harbour.  Catch the trade winds in your sails.  Explore.  Dream.  Discover."  ~Mark Twain   There's so many others that inspire me as well, but those ones are my favourites.  If you have not yet done so already, you absolutely must read "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho!  It really is the most amazing book that you will ever read in your life, and it is this book that I draw my life's inspiration from.  Many of the things that I have written about above are discussed in this book, which is a fable about a shepherd boy in Spain and how he goes about to achieve his Personal Legend.  Your "Personal Legend" is what you dreamed about becoming as a child, and that all the universe conspires to help you achieve it when you listen to your heart and are brave enough to go out and find it.  I know that sounds all very new-agey and uber-cheesy and I can imagine a few of you rolling your eyes right now, but trust me on this one, it really is an incredible book and I encourage, no, PLEAD, with you to go out and read it right now!  Life is short, and I want to be able to get the most out of the opportunities that I've been given, and experience all that this world has to offer.  So there ya go!  Sorry that took so long, but I wanted to be able to really properly and thoroughly explain myself.  You've just been given some insight into what I'm out doing, and also into what I believe, and how I'm choosing to live my life.  I hope that I have not offended anyone with this entry!  I don't mean to over-criticize or insult anyone's choices in life or get all preachy up here on my silly soapbox.  These are just the values that I'm choosing to follow, and it's a path in life that's not meant for everyone.  Follow your own heart and your own dreams, and just take what I've said with a grain of salt.  It's my opinion only, after all, and we're allowed to have that.  I just wanted to share with you how I feel and open up a little.  I'd really love to hear your thoughts about this, and encourage absolutely everyone who either agrees or disagrees or supports or was upset or whatever by anything that I wrote.  This whole blog thing has been great and I love writing in it but it's very 'one-way' and a little unfair, cause you get to understand exactly everything that I'm experiencing and thinking, but I don't often get to hear anything back.  It's a one-way dialogue, and I'd love to know what you're thinking.  Be honest, be brutal if you need to be.  I just laid out all my thoughts and feelings out to be exposed on the table.  Now it's your turn.  :-)  s2hworldtour@hotmail.com  I'll be waiting...  ;-)

      Things have improved so much at work!  The new school semester in Korea began this week, and so as a result we have new students and a new schedule.  Many of our former kindergartens have graduated up to elementary levels, and there's quite a lot of new faces around the school these days, including some new teachers.  Things are much more organized now than they were before.  In my first three weeks of teaching things were still very much 'in transition' and I never really knew what was going on.  I just took it day-by-day and a lot of times just had to make it up as I went along (lessons and such.)  Well now we have textbooks and worksheets and formal lessons for the kids, and it makes my job so much easier.  I actually have a pre-set curriculam to follow and it's so much nicer to have proper materials to work with!  I can walk in everyday knowing what to expect and I think the kids are enjoying the new materials as well.  Also, my schedule varies a bit, so some days I start at 10am, and others 11am - both times work well for me and I'm thankful that I don't have to wake up too early!  One thing that I definitely appreciate about this job (that I was not able to enjoy while working at Delany's) is never having to work at the crack of dawn, and always having my entire weekends free!  I think this is the first job I've ever had in my entire life where I have both Saturday and Sunday off every single week - IT'S AWESOME!!!  I've been watching a fair bit of TV these days during my weeknights and I've made a lot of observations.  And thanks to the tape that Barb sent me, I've been able to do some comparative studies between Korean and Canadian media/television programming, and particularly with commercials.  For example, in Korea, a lot of times you get all your commercials at once, at the beginning of the show generally, and then you get to watch the entire show straight through uninterrupted.  This is both a blessing and a curse.  It's great to be able to watch a show without having some annoying commercial break it up, but to have to sit through ten full minutes of commercials can be agonizing sometimes!  I've noticed that there's two main styles of Korean commercials - there's the 'music video', and there's the 'infomercial.'  The first is very enjoyable and kitschy and fun to watch, the latter is not!  Most commercials here tend to be very energetic and lively and super cheesy full of pop or rock or techno music, with the actors dancing around or being extremely animated.  Lots of Western music finds its way into these commercials and it can be hilarious!  For example, I've seen a commercial for instant noodles featuring Mary J. Blige's "Family Affair" where the guy in the commercial is trying to woo over a saucy Korean vixen who's grooving and moaning against this wall at a party, with her own package of instant noodles, rockin' out to Mary J.  And there's another one I've seen with Kelly Clarkson's "Miss Independent" that's used in a cell phone commercial, where some sexy Korean chick is getting blown through the air around downtown because of these waves magically coming out of her phone "what is this feeling taking over..."  Very cheesy, very funny!  And then there's the informercials, which are  sooooo long  and  so annoying !  They are honestly a full ten minutes long (one commercial, for ONE product!) and are structured just like how you would see on The Home Shopping Network.  Often the commercial will repeat itself so it's like having to watch it several times in a row.  These infomercials always have the same ingredients: one absolutely useless product + one Korean male in a suit who invented it + at least 2 Korean women who act all excited about the product while either demonstrating it or discussing its amazing qualities + one hot Korean female model to make you watch the commercial in its entirety + one audience full of fake cheesy actors to "ooohh" and "ahhhh" at just the right moments + one fake award/'official' recognition of some sort (ex: Best Invention Of The Year!: 2002!) to make the product seem more credible + an amazing and sudden slashing of the price to make it seem like it's on sale + one or more *Wow! Free!* other useless shit products thrown in to close the deal.  The result is a cookie-cutter recipe for selling useless shit on TV (pretty much the same style as Western infomercials!)  These  commercials were mildy entertaining at first, but when you have to watch the same ones over and over, it gets really old, really fast!  I've learned to just 'tune out' when these annoying Korean informercials come on screen, but this has caused an unusual side effect while watching Western programming....  When I was watching the tape full of shows that Barb mailed me, I felt *compelled* to watch all the commercials and pay great attention to what the sponsors were trying to sell!  It's like because I almost never hear anything English (as in on the streets, on the bus, or while channel-surfing here) that anytime I do hear English, I  HAVE  to stop and listen!  I've become so accustomed to just not hearing my native language on a daily basis that whenever I do it almost  shocks  my ears, who do a 'double-take' and just have to SOAK IN whatever it is they're hearing, even if it is just a silly Tide or Sleep Country Canada commercial on a tape that my friend sent me.  Why this is, I can't explain, and it's a little disorienting, I must confess.  I'm not sure if I should laugh at myself, or be concerned!  :-)

      It is with great pleasure that I announce to all of you that "My Love" has been officially retired at school!  THANK GOD!!!  We had beaten that song to death, at least 8 times over, and I think even the kids were gonna vomit if they had to sing it one more bloody time!  ;-)  Today we started learning a new song, and yes, it's another Westlife song (what can I say, boy band pop music is king in Korea!)  This time it's actually a Westlife cover song - yep, it's the Billy Joel classic "Uptown Girl!"  I have to confess that I'm a huge fan of this song (both the Billy Joel and the bubbly Westlife version) and was actually as excited as the kids were when it was announced that it was going to be our new vocal project.  We debued the video today in class and it's actually wonderfully cute and cheesy.  The 5 Westlife guys play the role of the staff at a 50's diner, being forced to serve a group of very rude and obnoxious 'uptown boys'.  All of a sudden, mid-way through the song, who walks in to the diner?  Why it's  THE  uptown girl of all uptown girls, Claudia Schiffer!  Of course, by the end of the video, she chooses the Westlife boys (her 'downtown men') and they leave the diner behind, Miss Schiffer in hand, with the uptown boys left behind in shock.  It's a funny video and worth downloading from the 'net to check out.  What was unexpectedly amusing today was how I had to explain to the class (and my teacher) what  exactly  an uptown girl was.  I think I did a great job in explaining the cultural nuances between what is meant to be 'uptown' versus 'downtown', and why someone would sing a song about this.  Class differences, economic backgrounds separating potential lovers, and what it means to be working in the service industry, yet be able to leave your job mid-shift with the world's hottest supermodel, all had to be explained in simple details for the Koreans, who eagerly ate up this Western sociological paradigm.  (See, teaching English is much more than just teaching vocabulary and grammar!!!)  :-)  It's funny cause these are all things that I've never really thought about before, but had to think over carefully before explaining everything.  It just goes to show that there's so many aspects to Western culture (or any culture for that matter) that a native doesn't even think about, until someone from another culture asks you to explain something that you've always either just taken for granted, or had been 'programmed' to understand from when you were a child.    I think it would be *fascinating* if someone did like a Masters in Education thesis, or an anthropological study, on "What It Means To Be An Uptown Girl."  Any takers?  :-)

      Today was a wonderfully lazy and relaxing day.  I slept in late, and then chatted to a bunch of friends online from all over the world - gotta love the internet's ability to connect kindred spirits all across the globe!  I then stayed in my jammies most of the day, having breakfast in bed while watching Alias (courtesy of Barb, who mailed me a tape full of all my favourite shows - Barbie you're awesome!!!!)  Laundry and groceries took up the rest of my day, as well as plenty of reading.  Sometimes it's so nice to be so lazy....  My host family invited me up for dinner tonight and it was great.  They prepared an absolutely delicious dinner of chicken, roast potatoes and carrots, fresh veggies, fruit, and rice - all food that they know I will eat. I am so damn lucky to have such a kind and generous host family looking after me here in Korea.  They really do bend over backwards to make sure that I'm comfortable and happy.  Whenever we have dinner, they only make food that they know I will eat (which severely limits what Korean dishes they can make, as I don't eat red meat or most seafood) and have bought me so many things for my house.  Dishes, blankets, laundry soap, a doormat, other odds and ends for my kitchen, as well as a constant supply of fresh filtered drinking water are just some of the things that they have bought for me over the last few weeks.  And when you add on the TV channels, the internet, and all my utility bills, none of which they are required to pay for (but they do) according to my contract, it just shows how generous they really are.    You hear so many horror stories about Canadians who come to Korea to be English teachers and end up at nightmare schools with totalitarian dictators for bosses.  You hear stories about people who teach at schools that close down suddenly mid-contract, or bosses who take advantage of their employees by overworking them, or about teachers not getting paid what was promised to them...  I'm so fortunate that I don't have a boss like that!  They've been very flexible and accommodating and have never once been rude or cheap or insensitive.  Yeah I may be living way out in the burbs in kind of a crappy area, but I'm at a great school with an awesome boss so I really do have nothing to complain about.  Everything else I can handle, deal with, or take care of myself.    Steven and his family have treated me like I was one of their own children - they refuse to accept money for anything, and invite me along to every major family event that goes on.  They've even gone as far to invite me to spend Christmas with them and their relatives at their time-share condo at some ski resort here in Korea for this coming holiday season.  And apparently when the next long weekend comes in April, Steven is going to take all the teachers at REI out of the city for some little weekend retreat.  HE IS SO NICE!!!!  Another example of their dedication to my comfort...  I had noticed that since Thursday's blizzard my apartment has been absolutely freezing.  I have tried numerous times to turn up the heat using the electronic thermostat on the wall, but no matter who high I cranked it up my apartment still felt like an ice box.  And the floors in my bedroom, normally heated all day, were stone-cold...  I thought maybe that it was just the low temperatures outside but eventually I clued in that something was up.  I mentioned this to Steven last night after dinner and he and his wife came down immediately to have a look at it.  For love or money they could NOT figure out why the heat would not come on!  They spent the next hour and a half going through the furnace manuals, pushing buttons, turning valves, and trying absolutely everything to get it going again, despite the fact that it was late and everyone was tired.  Susan even went upstairs to get me an electric blanket for my bed!  Eventually they figured out that someone (probably Hye-Young when she was staying here and I wasn't home yet) had turned a wrong valve - one that shut off gas completely to my apartment.  The point is that they could have easily thrown in the towel at any point, or have just said "deal with it yourself", but they laboured right through until they had it figured out and it was back in business.  And then when it was done they insisted on vaccuming my entire apartment for fear that they had tracked in extra dirt from outside!  WOW!  Like I said before, I really am very lucky to have ended up with such a good Korean family, and feel extremely grateful for all their efforts in ensuring that Korea feels like home for me.

      I woke up bright and early this morning to get ready for the 3 hour drive to Daejon for the REI teacher's conference, but shortly after waking I received a knock at my door.  It was Steven, and he came down to tell me that because of all the snow, the conference has been postponed to a future date.  Apparently Thursday's country-wide blizzard was the highest recorded snowfall in Korea since 1904!  Although Seoul only received about 15 cm., areas of the country, including Daejon, were buried under close to 50 cm!  Snowfall this late in the year is highly unusual, but Mother Nature has been cranky to Korea for the past few weeks.  Weather normally at this time of year is in the early teens, but a cold air mass from Siberia (yes, it really is from Siberia...haha) has been coming down and just sitting over the Korean peninsula.  And so we anxiously await for spring....  So I had the whole day to myself, and no plans at all.  I took the opportunity to go back to bed, and sleep in late (always enjoyable) and then eventually got up and decided to play tourist that day.  I hopped on the train and it was off to Seoul Station to do some exploring of the city.  My Lonely Planet: Seoul (god bless those people - they rock my world!) have a small listing of really cool "city walks" to check out in Seoul, and so I picked one today - the Mt. Namsan/Seoul Tower walk.  AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE, QUITE POSSIBLY, MY BEST DAY YET IN KOREA!!!  Namsan is the mountain that's right smack in the middle of the city, and Seoul Tower, constructed in 1975, is Seoul's most popular landmark, rising as a sleek white pinnacle high above the bustling city.  There is a gondola that goes up the mountain, but that's for wusses, and hey I need the exercise (and have the time) so why not hike it up?  The hike up was actually easier and shorter than I thought it would be.  It was a very brisk and cool afternoon, but it proved to be almost perfect weather for hiking up a very long staircase (no overheating!)  The hike was absolutely amazing!  The mountain is wooded and the hiking trail has plenty of places to rest and little 'sneak views' of the city as you climb.  The view at the top is absolutely unbelievable!!!!  Imagine in your head a sea of skyscrapers, for 360 degrees, as far as the eye can see, with astounding jagged mountains, attemting to hold in the burgeoning metropolis, covered under a light dusting of snow, all under a brilliant clear blue sky.  That was what rewarded me at the top - man, it was sooo worth that climb.  I literally just had to stop and stare and take it all in for like a good hour, and this was before I even went up the tower!  It was 5000 won to go up Seoul Tower, and its worth every penny.  The view up there is even more breathtaking than at the mountain peak.  You can see out in every direction, and it really does give you an idea of how incredibly massive this city is.  Unlike say a North American city, which may have a collection of highrises downtown and then the rest of the city is low-rise sprawl, Seoul is literally almost all skyscrapers. No matter what direction you turn your head, all you see are mile after mile after mile of endless apartment and office towers.  You can even strain your eyes and see even more highrises in the far distance - the city literally goes on much further than what the human eye can see at that distance.  And as mentioned before, what adds to the wonder of it all is the rim of mountains that circle the entire city, especially the peaks to the north which seemed so close, that I could almost reach out and touch them...  Down below is a maze of crazy narrow streets running in every which way, and a chaotic labrinth of expressways attempting (rather futilely) to funnel traffic in and out of the city...so many cars, so many people, so many buildings!!!  The Han River slices right through the middle - a wide and slow avenue of shimmering water, meandering towards the West Sea.  From the top you can even see Yeouido Island, where I had gone exploring just last Monday.  And at the tip of the island there was the 63 Building - with all its glittering golden glass, rising high up into the sky - so completely bright and massive that you can't help but have your eyes drawn to it.  Other sights from atop Seoul Tower include the Olympic Stadium, the World Cup Stadium, "downtown Seoul" with its collection of Korean corporate headquarter towers, a dozen universities or more, Itaewon, and a million other neighbourhoods.  Its an endless sea of sprawling urbanity, and its just so incredible - you swear you're on another planet!  Unlike anything I've ever seen before....WOW!  I hiked back down but wasn't ready to go home yet, so I thought I'd go and check out another neighbourhood that I haven't been to yet.  I'm not sure what the name of this particular area is, but it's inbetween the Jonggak and Jongno 3-ga subway stations, and it was so much fun!  It was completely packed and busy and full of stores, restaurants, and bars.  It was sorta like being at Bucheon again, only imagine Bucheon on steroids!  Lots of cool places to explore, and many familiar chains there too, like TGI Fridays, Outback Steakhouse, and Starbucks.  I went looking for the Tower Records, but it's not where my map says it should be!  I walked up and down several streets looking for it, but alas, never did find that elusive store.  One day I will....  I've been told that maps of Seoul are often incorrect - sometimes the errors are small, and sometimes way off completely.  Not sure why that is, but hey you just gotta go with the flow I guess.  I didn't find Tower Records, but I got to see lots of this really lively cool bustling hip happenin' area of town - one I definitely plan on going back to to explore more thoroughly.    I came across a few amazing and unexpected sights, including the Jongro Tower.  The Jongro Tower is probably the most unusual skyscraper that I have ever seen in my life!!!  It's VERY TALL and futuristic looking, with three giant supporting beams that rise up past the roof of the tower, to support a massive ring around the top.  It's absolutely nuts and crazy to explain - check out the photo of it here:  http://www.emporis.com/en/il/im/?id=140542  It looks like it's from an alien city in 2156 or something eh?  Even more amazing when standing just across the street from it....  Well it was getting dark and I was starting to really feel the cold at this point, so it was back on the Incheon Train, down Line 1, and back to my apartment.  I got changed and then headed over to Halloween to meet up with Charles and Chris for some drinks.  I was the first to arrive, so while I was enjoying a good stiff G&T at the bar by myself this group of people next to me started chatting me up.  They were 2 Korean girls and 2 Canadian guys and were all English teachers who worked together.  They were super friendly and it was cool to meet some new people.  They're regulars at this bar and even know who Charles is (of course, *everyone* knows who crazy Charles!! haha!)  Charles showed up a bit later (Chris never did) and we all hung out and had some drinks together.  Around 1am I was really starting to feel tired, and Charles was still recovering from his night out at Halloween there the night before, so we headed home and I hit the hay.  A completely amazing and awesome day.  Its days like today, full of such wonder and amazement and inspiration and discovery, that are the reason why I came to Korea.

      I woke up this morning and got ready for work while Hye-Young was still asleep.  While I was in the shower I was still slightly afraid that she'd walk in to 'visit' me while I was all naked and vulnerable in the shower....  Luckily, she just kept on sleeping...  She woke up when I was having breakfast, and the sweet girl was all embarrassed and apologetic about her surprise presence.  We sat at the breakfast table and had a pleasant chat.  She was curious about what was in my bedroom, so I brought her in and showed her all my photos in frames that I have around the room.  She's very curious about personal details about my life, and was very excited when I brought out two photo albums for her to look at.  The first one was the album that Barb gave me full of photos of me and my friends at my going-away party in Vancouver, and looking through the album went something like this: "Is she your girlfriend?  "No, Hye-Young, she's just a friend."  *turn the page*  "Is she your girlfriend?" "No, she too is just a friend..."  REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT.   She went ecstatic when she saw the second photo album, which was the one that my sister made for me about a year ago, and contains photos of her and I, right from young childhood to present.  Hye-Young absolutely loved it!!  (and kept commenting how beautiful she thought Janelle was - looks like you've got a fan now too in Korea, Janelle!!!)  She left shortly after that, and as harmless as I'm sure she is, I was still relieved to see her go.  I GOT SOME MORE MAIL TODAY!!!!!!!!  I received a very lovely card and two sexy party photos, courtesy of Chad, John, Alex, Cori, and Diva Deb back in Vancouver.  THANKS SO MUCH GUYS - I LOVE 'EM!!!!  An extra big thank you to Debs for mailing it off to me - how thoughtful!!!  :-)  Getting mail is very exciting these days, and so I encourage my friends and family to send me mail!  *hint hint*  hehe...  I've actually always really been impressed each and every time I receive a piece of mail (and I'm not talking bills here!)  And this applies also to when I'm living in Canada, and definitely even more so now that I'm overseas.  Think about - for the price of a dollar (and honestly, what you can for a dollar these days?  Nuthin'!) someone who you don't even know will deliver your little piece of mail, one of millions of little pieces of mail that are going somewhere that day, ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE PLANET!  Yes, it takes thousands of people actually to run a postal service, and yes it's  their job  to make sure that it's delivered safe and sound to you, but I'm still always impressed by it.  The fact that more mail doesn't get lost than what actually does, I think, is amazing.  Such tiny little snapshots of someone's life - one individual message of love, or hope, or congratulations, or birthday wishes, or heartache, or sympathy - journeying across our chaotic Earth's surface in only a matter of days...delivered directly to you.  Bits of all that represent the best of humanity, criss-crossing each other in an infinite pattern of airport hubs, conveyer belts and flight paths, in the staggering quantity of millions and millions every single day.  (Well, I think it's cool.)  I also found out some other exciting news today.  This Saturday my boss and I are going to an REI Teacher's Conference!  AND IT'S IN TAEJON!!!  (D)Taejon is another city in the middle of South Korea, about 3 hours from Seoul.  A car trip - yah!!!!!!!!!!  This will be my first time seeing the Korean countryside, and I'm really excited about it!  It's amazing how small South Korea is.  In only 3 hours you're already more than half way across the country.  To put it into perspective, South Korea is only slightly larger than the state of Indiana!  WOW!  (And yet 50 million people fit inside...)  We're gonna head out pretty early tomorrow morning, as the conference begins at 1pm.  Directors and foreign teachers from tons of other REI school will be there (REI is a chain English Language School - I think there are over 30 campuses in Korea!)  I'm really excited at the possibility of meeting other foreign teachers and making some new friends (hopefully a few of them will live in Seoul, or out in the burbs like me.)  :-)  It should be a great day for sure!!!

      So it was mid-afternoon today and I looked outside my classroom window to see....big giant fluffy flakes falling from the sky!  SNOW!!!  It was beautiful - the kind of snowflakes that take forever to hit the ground, big enough that you can easily catch and watch as they melt in your hand...the kind from a page directly from your childhood, when the mere sight of a single snowflake signified entire afternoons building snowmen and forts in the yard, and sledding down the back hill.  The kids were squealing with excitement, and spent more time looking out the window than at me.  This wasn't a problem today, as this afternoon was "game day," and we spent the entire half-day playing hangman on the board (a big hit with the kids these days.)   Hye-Young was in our school today and she pulled me aside inbetween two of the classes to chat.  She's a really nice girl, but I think she's crazy.  Well, if not crazy, then just really into me.  She loves to ask odd and unusual questions (odd even for a Korean!) and every time I see her she continually asks if I have a girlfriend, if I like Korean girls, what I look for in a girlfriend, etc.  I dunno, I just get this vibe that she has a thing for me.  I only want to be friends with her though, for several reasons.  I mean she's pleasant to talk to, but a little odd, and to be honest she makes me a little uncomfortable sometimes with how *overtly flirty* she is.  Either way, she's the only one that I'm really careful with that I don't flirt too much with her - I don't wanna be misleading (or, heaven forbid, encourage even more aggresive flirting...)  By the time class got out at 6pm several centimetres of the white stuff had already fallen - the first time I've seen a significant accumulation of snow here in Korea (we had a light dusting a while back but it didn't even last the night.)  I was meeting Charles (the crazy Kolon-Mart one) for dinner that night so I went home and got ready.  I put on my woolies and headed out into the winter wonderland to go meet up with him.  The city was absolutely stunning - a thick white blanket covering absolutely everything in a soft downy cover.  Shihung City looked so calm and so still and so CLEAN under all that snow.  Hell, if I looked towards the trees or up at the mountains, I could've almost been back in Canada!  Charles and I decided that we were both bored of the restaurants in our area so we agreed to catch a bus to Bucheon to find something over there.  If only we had known what adventure taking the bus would be....  As beautiful as the snow was in Shihung, it caused an absolute chaos with the local traffic.  I'm not sure how accustomed to driving in snow Koreans are, but cars were slipping and sliding all over the place, and all the drivers seemed to be on edge and near panicky.  Every single major road was backed up with gridlock for as far as the eye could see...and so our bus just *crawled* along, inching towards Bucheon.  We were moving at a fairly steady pace, considering the road conditions, until we got to what I call "No Man's Land."  No Man's Land is the area of city in between Shihung City and Bucheon.  A large ridge of land separates the two cities, and the hill is fairly undeveloped and rather wooded.  The road leading between the two cities over the hill is also VERY narrow and curvy!  (Let's just say that on a  good day  I'm surprised that the bus makes it okay on this route without either colliding with another vehicle or rolling off one of the steep corners...)  In the snowy weather, No Man's Land turned out to be a bus driver's worst nightmare!  It was backed up completely - all the way from Shihung to Bucheon.  Traffic would crawl along for a few metres, then stop for ten minutes, then crawl along a little more....  It was absolutely painful!  Actually it wasn't all that bad cause when you're with Charles the conversation is NEVER dull.  That boy talks about all kinds of things you can't even imagine, and literally has endless crazy stories about his escapades across Asia.  Most of his stories are either R or X-rated, so let's just say that I'm glad that we were the only English-speaking passengers on the bus!  Traffice was totally nuts though - people were actually abandoning their cars on the side of the road and WALKING to Bucheon.  (Interesting side note - Koreans are very similar to Vancouverites in the way that they use their  umbrellas  for snow - how silly!)  Our bus was barely able to make it up the steep hill with all the snow and slush, and a few times all the passengers in the front of the bus had to come down to the back of the bus to add weight and give more traction for the driver!  We even passed a couple other busses that were either completely stuck or almost in the ditch!  CRAZY!  The bus ride from Shihung to Bucheon  normally takes 15 minutes, but on this particular night, our ride stretched out to TWO HOURS!!!!  WOW!!!!!!!!  By the time we pulled into the bus/subway station at Bucheon, it was after 10:30pm at night and Charles and I were absolutely starving!!!  We had originally planned on going to Pizza Hut for dinner, but most of Bucheon's restaurants were already closed by the time we arrived.  We ended up having a fried chicken dinner in some Korean restaurant - quite tasty actually!  (and, as usual, Charles provided very vivid and 'enlightening' dinner conversation!)  After dinner we went and had a drink at Halloween, and then cabbed it home.  By the time I got home it was nearly 1:30am!  And this is where the real surprise comes in...  When I got home to my apartment, I walked into the landing and took off my shoes (there are two doors to get into my apartment, and inbetween the two is my landing.)  I looked down and noticed a pair of WOMEN'S SHOES by the door....  Hmmm....that's odd, I thought...those certainly aren't mine!!!  I went to unlock the second door, but it pushed right open....  I stepped into my dark apartment, and heard rustling inside....  I called out "Hello?" (what does one say in a situation like that?  "Whoever you are, get the fuck out of my apartment?")  I heard a moan from inside one of the rooms....  WHAT THE....????????????????????????????????  I walked into the second bedroom (I have two - one for me, and one that I use as a storage and clothes-drying area - this second bedroom has 2 extra beds in it as well) turned on the light, and SAW A WOMAN SLEEPING IN THE BED!!!!!  IT WAS HYE-YOUNG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Honest to god, my first thought was "Oh My God, she's a crazy horny Korean stalker chick, and she's broken into my apartment so that she can try and seduce me!!!!  What the fuck do I do now?"    "What are you doing here!!!???" I called out, probably sounding quite rude.  She just kept moaning (luckily a tired moan, not a "come here, you big boy, momma's been waitin' for ya" moan) and squinting because of the light.  She didn't say a word I swear for like the world's longest minute, as I just stood and stared at her in disbelief.  When she finally responded, she explained that with all the snowfall and traffic chaos she wasn't able to get home (she lives quite far from Shihung City) and so Steven had offered my spare bedroom to her.  Ahhhh yes, that makes WAY more sense than my crazy (and probably overly-egotistical) seduction theory.  Whew!  What a relief!!!  I went to sleep right away, but it was  very odd  knowing that she was *in* my apartment....    :-P

      So I'm very happy to report that I've got all my money matters all sorted out!  I've got a full tummy now and food in the cupboard...YAH!!!!  :-)  Scotty's a happy boy!!!  This morning my boss took me for a ride to that bank in Bucheon to get my traveller's cheques sorted out.  It was really nice of him to take time out of his day to do that, especially considering how busy he is.  The Korea Exchange Bank in Bucheon had no problem taking my Canadian money, and about a half hour later I was walking out with a wad of won!!  By the time we got back to Shihung City we had missed all the morning classes, so in essence I had the morning off today.    Life in Korea really is about taking things one step, one day at a time.  When you first arrive absolutely everything is unknown and intimidating, and you can't figure out how to get anywhere, where to buy food, what the currency is like, or even how to use your own washing machine.  It seems that nothing is simple, and everything is a complicated ordeal.  But everyday you find a new mission and accomplish something that makes your life that much easier.  Bit by bit, you start to figure out life here.  And so now after nearly 20 days I've got most of the basics down I think.  I know how to get myself into and out of the city, I know where I can buy food that I'll wanna eat, and I'm slowly starting to make friends.  And hey as of today I've know which bank will cash Canadian Traveller's Cheques!  I still have a few other major missions to accomplish, like getting my Alien Registration Card, opening up my first Korean bank account, wiring $$$ to my account in Canada, and getting a phone line!  But like I said, it's all about one day at a time.  If you try to think of *everything* that you have to do, it just overloads your brain.    On the way back to Shihung Steven informed me that they're starting construction soon on a new subway line - one that's going to connect Bucheon to Shihung City - and there will even be a new station like a block away from where the school is.  Too bad I won't be here to enjoy it when it's finished...in 2009! Shihung City (and Bucheon to an extent as well) seems to be in a constant state of construction, everywhere you look.  The Koreans literally cannot build houses and roads and transit fast enough to keep up with all the growth.  I think it would be really cool to come back to Shihung City in like 10 or even 5 years and see all the changes...  So I'm sad to report that we're STILL singing "My Love" every single day in class....not sure why the torture continues!!!  I'm thinking that I need to either suggest a new song to my boss or we just move on, cause let's be honest here, all of us - staff and students included - can recite the god damn song backwards and forwards without any effort at all.  I firmly believe that this song is now permanately ingrained in all of our brains!  FOR LIFE!  :-)  I had dinner out tonight with Glen (he was one of the guys that I partied with at Bucheon a week and a half ago) and it was cool to eat out with another teacher and trade stories.  We went to this Korean restaurant near where we live and had a chicken stir-fry dinner, very similar to the one I had last week with Hye-Young, but not as spicy this time...  Maybe I'm adjusting to Korean cuisine?  That would be a good thing, methinks.  Anyways, it was a pretty quiet day here today - no major dramas to report!  (and I know how much you love reading about the dramas....!)  Hey!  A guy needs a break from it once in a while!  hehe....  The weekends always seem to be extremely eventful and exciting...I'm sure I'll have plenty of stories then!

      So there's no feeling "lovelier" than having an empty cupboard, being absolutely starving, and having no money at all cause every bank or currency exchange place you visit doesn't want your Canadian traveller's cheques!!!  That was my situation today!  NOT FUN!  I ran out of Korean won on the weekend and had to wait until today to try and cash in my American Express traveller's cheques (all are in Canadian dollars.)  I was told, by numerous sources before leaving Canada, including CIBC, that I would have no problem cashing in my Canadian TC's.  Boy was that ever a lie!!!  I went to a major bank today, and after standing in line for nearly an hour, was redirected to another line, and then was told that my cheques could not be cashed (after they stared at them in utter confusion for a good 5 minutes.)  I felt like saying "Yes, there are other currencies out there OTHER than the American dollar!!!"  I was redirected to a whole other bank, one located in Bucheon - What?  NO BANKS in Shihung City handle this kind of stuff?  Grrr....  And the problem with this other bank is that it's only open (assuming I can even find it) from 9:30am - 4:30pm M-F...which is right when I teach!!  How am I supposed to be able to go to this damn bank when I'm at work all day?  I WAS NOT IN A GOOD MOOD!!  I was about to have a bit of a meltdown, but then worked out a plan and it's seeming to be working out so far...  I explained the situation to my boss and he's lending me 100,000 Won until we get this sorted out, and has even offered to drive me to the bank tomorrow morning to help me out with this.  It's all been very frustrating indeed, but I think that having a Korean with me who can converse with the bank staff will make all this much easier.  You can definitely add this whole thing to the VERY LONG LIST of "Why I Hate All Banks!"  I've learned that cash is definitely the way to go here in Korea.  So I went to the Kolon-Mart tonight and bought a big-ass load of groceries - I'll be more than fine for the rest of the week now!  It's still interesting to see what products can (and cannot) be found in the stores here - there's so many that they just don't sell at all and it makes me wonder why - like why cream cheese, but no bagels?  Or why a million and one kinds of Thousand Island salad dressing, but no Ranch?  Why only sliced processed cheese, and not block cheese?  Why sliced ham (red meat -ewww) and not like turkey or chicken?  I guess these are all just small cultural differences between Korea and Canada.  I've had a few friends (and family) back home offer to send me care packages of stuff that I'm missing - how sweet!  People were looking for suggestions, so here is a random list of things that I wish I could buy in stores here, but can't.  Most of this stuff you can't even mail anyways, but this is what I'm craving:  -bagels and cream cheese -Ranch dressing -Cadbury mini-eggs -CHEESE!!!  marble or cheddar or swiss or brie or camembert...whatever...any kind sounds good to me. -a kind of bread other than white (I am soooo missing brown or multi-grain bread!) -Michelina's microwave dinners -Kraft Dinner -Cambell's Chunky Soups (like Chicken Noodle or Clam Chowder or Chicken Vegetable...) -Lipton Sidekicks - those instant pasta and rice thingies - especially Garlic Raefallo pasta(sp?), or Broccoli & Cheddar Rice -Lipton Iced Tea (the one with the blue lid, not the gross one with the yellow lid) -Caramilk or Oh Henry or Crunch or Snickers bars -nachos!!!  with cheese and sour cream and guacamole...mmmm..... -2-bite brownies -Ritz Bitz sandwiches (the cheese kind) -those Swiss Cheese crackers -cookie dough ice cream -cheesecake (actually they do have cheesecake here, in bakeries, I just haven't bought any yet) -a million and one other things that I just can't think of right now!  :-)  Oh yeah, if anyone feels like mailing me an OVEN, I'll be more than happy to give you my first-born child!  I was never really much a cook back in Canada, but 90% of the cooking that I did do was in the oven - like casseroles and frozen stuffed chicken breasts and pizza and stuff like that.  GOD DO I MISS MY OVEN!!!  For whatever reasons Koreans just don't do ovens.  Apparently they're slowly starting to become popular here and are available in newer homes, but traditionally they just do not exist in the common Korean kitchen.  I do have a microwave, so anything that can be microwaved is great...but unlike North America, there's not a lot of things in Korea that can go in the micro.    One more thing...and if anyone can figure out how to instantly beam over a meal cooked by either my mother or by my friends Tom or Benoit (and in all honesty, it can be *ANYTHING* cooked by them) so that it still arrives still hot and fresh and yummy, I'll give you anything that you want!  You name it - it's yours!!  (and hey you'll also win the Nobel Prize for...Being An Amazing Scientist?)  Just an idea anyways!  :-)

      Not a lot happened today.  I didn't have to work though because it was a national holiday (Independence Movement Day) which means a nice, long weekend for Scotty!   (and still getting paid for it too - hooray!) I talked to my parents on the phone for a bit this morning, and it's always great to hear their voices.  The whole concept of "distance" is really a strange one for me.  I mean I know that I live VERY FAR away from where I was born, but in all honesty Seoul doesn't really feel that much further away from Thunder Bay than when I lived in Vancouver.  I guess for me, I've always measured distance in my head by using one of three categories:    (Using Thunder Bay as an example) 1) You live in Thunder Bay. 2) You don't live in Thunder Bay, but live close enough that you could visit fairly often, like on the weekend or for a holiday or special birthday dinner or something like that.  (Kinda like how Winnipeg is to Thunder Bay, or Seattle is to Vancouver.) 3) You live far enough away that you can only really visit once a year.    Both Vancouver and Seoul fall into category #3.  I guess in my head I've been living far from home for quite a while, now it just means a longer plane ride to get home.  Does all of this sound strange?  Does anyone else measure distance with these terms besides me?    Also, every once in a while, and usually at the most random of moments, this thought will suddenly pop into my head:  "HOLY FUCK!  I'M LIVING IN  *ASIA!*   WOW!!!!!!!!"  It baffles me every time.  As a child, Asia always seemed like it was on another planet while I was growing up in Thunder Bay - a place that was so far away it was almost beyond comprehension, a place that I would probably never ever get to visit in my lifetime (mind you, when I was a child, Port Arthur seemed far away from my house...)  And now, here I am, living in Seoul, tens of thousands of kilometres away from where I grew up.  CRAZY!  And if I continue the thought about me living in Asia, I start to think about how places like Japan and China and RUSSIA are actually just around the corner from South Korea.  WOW!!!  Why these thoughts get me so excited or strike such a chord, I'm not entirely sure why.  Maybe it's cause I studied geography in school so exploring the concepts of space and distance first-hand is really amazing for me, or maybe it goes back to that childhood idea of Asia being located somewhere near Neptune, but it really does get me everytime.  I wonder if any of my other friends who've moved overseas have ever thought about this (Ryan in Taiwan? Jenn in Australia?  Mimi in Hong Kong?  Jen in Scotland?  Any thoughts?)  Not wanting to waste a perfectly sunny (but cold, when does it start to get warm in Korea?  Now would be nice, thank you very much...) day off, I thought I'd check off something from my list of places to visit in Seoul.  I took the subway down to Yeouido Island - a large island on the south banks of the Han River.  Yeouido is home to many of Seoul's tallest high rises, and is ringed by a string of riverfront parks and greenspaces - one of the nicest areas in the city for sure.  The waterfront was bustling with activity today - I guess everyone was thinking the same idea as me - to get out and enjoy the city - and the park was just packed with families, happy couples, and groups of friends.  Yeouido is really popular for biking and rollerblading and I discovered that today.  The whole riverfront of Seoul, on both sides of the Han, actually has a long network of trails so it's possible to bike or blade from one end to the other on a continuous smooth path.  This is pretty amazing for an Asian city, where waterfronts are usually just used for garbage disposal and industrial uses (or so I've been told by people who've been elsewhere in Asia.)  You can even rent bikes from Yeouido - I didn't today, but definitely plan on doing that once the weather gets warmer.  I walked around, just enjoying the sights of the city.  I was pleasantly surprised to see jagged mountain peaks poking up from behind the city - I had never seen these before (either smog or the darkness of night had always obscured them) and they looked really beautiful, even from so far away.  Yeouido is also home to two of Seoul's most famous landmarks - the Korean National Assembly, and 63 Building - the tallest in Korea (guess who many floors it has!)  I took photos of both and spent the afternoon just taking it all in.  A chilly day, but enjoyable nonetheless.

      It's not very often that I wake up feeling hung over after a night out partying, but this morning, unfortunately, was a severe exception.  I woke up feeling like I had been run over by a truck full of squid, and my stomach felt soooo queasy.  (Funny thing is, I hadn't even drank that much the night before - nothing too crazy anyways!)  And the worst part is that I was *so hungry*, but eating was the last thing that I wanted to do at that moment.  Ugh....  Charles wanted to go and have breakfast, but again, just the thought of food made me wanna hurl all over his nice hotel room.  I decided to pass on the offer for a little brekky, and looking at my watch, noticed that I was due to meet up with Steven and his host family for lunch in 2 hours.  SHIT!  Time to run back to Shihung!  I had run out of Korean won the night before, so I attempted to cash some traveller's cheques to fatten up my wallet a bit.  I went to THREE exchange places and either they were closed, only exchanged cash for cash, or didn't do Canadian funds.  What the...?  Knowing that all the banks were gonna be closed tomorrow as well (this Monday is a national holiday in Korea), it looked like I'd have to survive on bread and water until Tuesday.  That and the million and one packets of instant noodles I have in my cupboard.  The train ride was painful with the constant rocking motion, and I was SO HUNGRY that I was starting to get the shakes (and Scotty's hypoglycemic mood swings started to kick in as well...not fun!)  I must've looked like an absolute mess on the train - still wearing the clothes from the night before, desperately in need of a shave, and reeking like cigarette smoke (unlike Vancouver, you can smoke pretty much anywhere you damn well feel like it in Korea, obviously including the bars!)  AND NO WINTER COAT EITHER!  Grrrr....  I arrived at my apartment like 10 minutes before we had to leave.  I quickly changed into something clean, fixed my rat's nest of hair up a bit, and tried to shove down some toast and juice to get my blood sugar levels back up.  I had just taken my first bite of toast when there was a knock on the door...time to leave! I was sooooo NOT in the mood for a lunch out 'with the family' but didn't want to be rude and turn down the invitation for lunch.  The Parks and I drove on over to a family friend's, not far up the street.  They live in a beautiful apartment on the 12th floor of a high rise and had spectacular views of the city.  One thing really cool about Korean families is how so many generations live in one household.  In this one apartment was the father and mother, 2 sons, and both grandmothers - so cool!  The other noteworthy thing about Korean families is that all the children (generally) stay living at home until they get married.  It's not uncommon for 'kids' to stay at home until they're 30 or whenever, as Koreans seem to be getting married later in life than what used to be traditional.  And even when they do get married, a lot of times they still live one of the spouse's families.  Wow!  It's so different from North America where each generation lives on their own.  I guess having all these generations living together has both its pros and cons I imagine - no privacy, but you always get to be close to all your loved ones.    We were served lunch, and even though I still didn't feel like eating anything, I knew that I needed to (and plus I didn't want to be rude!)  What was really sweet was that even though the mother (actually the grandmothers did most of the cooking!) had prepared a massive meal full of like 20 dishes, she also ordered take-out fried chicken, just for me...  (Looks like my seafood aversion reputation has spread across Korea....)  :-)  The meal was absolutely delicious, and it included many dishes considered edible by Scotty's tame and wimpy stomach, including lots of vegetables, fresh fruit, rice, and this yummy drink made from rice and grains...not sure how to explain that one...it's like drinking wheat, but actually tastes really good!  I felt SO MUCH better after eating anyways!  After the meal we all sat around and chatted, and I had a good hour of practicing English with Sandy and John (John is one of the sons of the family we were visiting, and he is the same age as Sandy.)  Sandy and John, like many Koreans, actually have a fairly good knowledge of simple English, but often are just too shy to practice it in 'real life' situations.  I don't know if it's a matter of being self-conscious or what, but I tried to make them feel comfortable and asked them lots of easy questions so they could practice.  The mother and one of the grandmothers sat around and listened in and even though they couldn't understand a word of English, seemed to be really excited over the conversation.  When I got home I was feeling much better, but still completely tired.  I spent the afternoon doing housework (oh the joys of laundry and vaccuming...) and then some reading in the evening.  I broke into the Lonely Planet: Southeast Asia On A Shoestring that Arion gave me and have really been enjoying it so far.  This book is totally pumping me up for my backpacking journey around Asia that I'd like to do after my year of teaching finishes.  I'm reading about Cambodia right now and it seems like such an amazing place - I can't wait to wander around the temples at Angkor Wat.  (Yes, Korea is only the beginning of the world tour...)  Later I watched Notting Hill (one of only 11 movies that I allowed myself to bring to Korea.)  God I'm such a sucker for cheesy romantic comedies...

      So it was a bit of sad morning today.  It's Friday and it's the last day of teaching for the kindergartens.  The whole morning was saddening, yet anti-climatic at the same time.  There was no goodbye party, no presents to send the kids off, no formal 'good luck at your next school' shindig.  Just regular classes, and that was it.  I'm not even sure if all of them know (or understand) that on Monday they'll be at a new school with new teachers, because none of them seemed upset by today's significance.  Maybe it's better that way - it would be harder for me to say goodbye if they were all in tears and stuff....  I'm really going to miss those kids...  :-(  One of my elementary students, James, is always bringing 'interesting' things to class to share with everybody.  And it's always some strange creature.  Last week he brought in a jar that had this GIANT BEETLE in it!  The thing was huge and gross-looking and smelled so bad, but he was so excited to show it off to everybody.  I have no idea where he got the thing from (it's certainly not a 'local' beetle - it's far too large) but the whole time I was teaching, and watching that giant insect press itself against the plastic, I just kept hoping that it wouldn't get out....  There's no way in hell I'm going to go and pick up that thing if it gets out!  ;-)  This week he brought in a pet snail...just a tiny one....but still odd to bring to school anyways.  I imagine him being the kind of boy that his room full of bugs and other odd creatures - a mini little 'zoo' full of stuff brought home from science class, and stuff found in the park across the street.  His Mom must love* cleaning out his room and finding all these little treasures** that James brings home.  * = be continually horrified and is currently seeking therapy for it ** = disgusting things she won't touch with a ten-foot pole or even her SuperPowerVac3000  Anyways Monday is the first day of all the new changes.  The schedule is still being sorted out, but I don't start my day now until the Grade 1 class, at 1:30pm!  Even though some adults have signed up already for the super early morning classes, Steven is taking care of them, it seems.  Maybe I won't be asked to get up at some ungodly hour to teach?  I don't know if the evening classes have been put together yet, but I'd be much more receptive to those.   I guess I'll find out who and when I teach on Monday.  Should be interesting!

      So another new pop song was introduced this week here at school, and yes, it was the internationally loved and loathed Quebec chanteuse, Miss Celine Dion.  Even before Steven told me what song of hers had been chosen, I already had the sickening feeling in my stomach that I already knew which one...  Yes, you're right, it's My Heart Will Go On.  ...and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on....  That song probably wins the title of the most overplayed song in radio history, so having it come back to haunt me here in Korea is like uncovering an audio skeleton in my Canadian closet.  (Actually, according to VH1, My Heart Will Go On is the second-most played song in the history of radio.  Any guesses as to which song is the first?  I'll give you a clue - it's a song from the 80's, sung by a British band who's lead singer later went solo - and is still producing albums today - and a remake of this song was done in 1997 by Puff Daddy.  You should be able to guess it now...)  Anyways, the kids were thrilled that this song had been chosen.  I guess Titanic was as huge in Korea as it was in North America and they were all very excited to watch the video.  The funny thing was that most of them already knew all the words to the song, even though all of them would have been between the ages of 1 and 6 when that movie came out, back in 1997.  I guess Titanic's (and Celine's) success has been going on and on, well past 97!  Anyways, while watching the video I told them that Celine Dion was Canadian, and this also got the kids very excited.  Their next question was whether or not I knew her.  I told them she was my sister...and the funny thing is they all believed it!!!  The entire class went absolutely hysterical when I told them this (especially the girls) and if I had virtual celebrity status before, well I definitely had super stardom celebrity status after this 'secret' was revealed to them!    I let this joke go for about two days and then I started to feel a little bit guilty for messing with their heads, so I told them that no she wasn't my sister, but actually....my ex-girlfriend!!!  Once again, they bought it (hook, line, and sinker!  Wow these kids are so trusting and gullible!) and I had celebrity status for another day.  Well yesterday I finally confessed that she's not related to me at all, and that I've never met (nor dated) her.  This was a bit surprising for the kids, but they didn't seem too disappointed over it anyways.  It actually caused a good laugh amongst the class!  Another thing amusing about this song, is in the video there's clips from the movie, and one of the clips is a brief flash of when Leo and Kate were getting it on in the car on the boat.  Well all my kids are still at the age where anything remotely sexy sends them into a fit where they cover their eyes, hide their faces, and squeal out in protest!  Every time this part of the video comes on, it's the same high-pitched feverish reaction - every single time.  I get a kick out it anyways, watching them squirm.  Too funny!

      So with all the upcoming changes at REI I've been busy in my free moments sorting out in my head what options may lay ahead, how I may approach both the good and the bad that will come about with the new education plan, and what to do if the worst-case scenarios do come about.  Basically one of two things could happen with this new education plan.  It either ends up saving the school and I don't lose my job (but I may have to work shitty hours or have really long days) or it fails, and the school ends up closing and I lose my job.  I've been thinking a lot about what would happen if the school closed and I lost my job, or if things became so bad at work that I had to quit.  I really don't want to quit, but if I feel the new plan screws me over I'm prepared to walk away from this job.  I don't want to do that, and will consider that a last-resort option, but it *is* a possibility.  I can only be patient and reasonable to a degree, and after that I'm just not willing to budge.  I'd feel guilty for walking away and leaving Steven high and dry, but hey it's not really my fault.  We agreed to certain conditions in the contract, and so technically he's breaking the contract FIRST by bringing about all these changes.  Again, as mentioned before, I know he's only trying to do what's best for the school and is not intentionally trying to screw me over, but there just might not be a future for me here at REI.  This potential has meant that I have to come up with a good solid Plan B in case this proves true.  If I had to quit, or lost my job, there's a few options out there.  The most obvious one is to just get a new teaching job here in Korea.  That should not prove to be difficult at all, as there's SO MANY jobs here that I could find something easily.  And plus I'm already in Korea, so that would save a future employer from having to pay to fly me over.  And I also have experience now (as brief as it is) which would look attractive on a resume.  However...there's a major catch to getting a new job in Korea.  Actually there's several...  Firstly, I'd lose my current work visa and would have to get a new one.  This is not a huge deal in terms of paperwork, but the thing is, you can only get a work visa from OUTSIDE of Korea.  I'd have to do what many other teachers have done before when they switch employers, which is to fly to Japan for the day and get a new work visa.  This is actually more regular and routine than one would imagine, but it's still something I'd like to avoid.  Some employers will pay for your day trip to Japan and others will not.  That could be a major cost to me, one I really can't afford.    Secondly, pretty much every single employer in Korea only wants to hire teachers for a minimum of a one-year contract.  Anything less is, from what I've gathered, almost unheard of here.  This would mean that I'd be starting back at Day 1 again.  It's not that I don't like Korea (I really am having a blast here and love the country) but I came here with the idea that I'd only be here for one year.  I've already formulated plans for what I want to do after next February when my current contract is up.  I was hoping to spend a few months backpacking in Asia, and then return home to Canada for a brief visit before, ideally, moving to Europe to teach English there.  Any extension of my time in Korea affects all my plans after.  And I really don't want that!  There's two things that I could do to get around this time restriction.  One, is to sign on for a one-year contract, and then just leave mid-contract, like 8 or 9 months into it.  Many teachers have done this before so I wouldn't be the first one, but I hate the idea of being dishonest or screwing over an employer.  And plus, if you leave your contract early you don't get the plane ticket home (not a big deal, as since I'm going travelling in Asia I'm effectively throwing it away anyways) and you don't get the bonus (equivalent to one month's pay - a huge incentive to finish your contract.)  It is the loss of that bonus that makes me reconsider doing this...  Or, I could look at teaching in another country until February or March of next year.  Some other countries are much more flexible with your contract length (China being a prime example) and so this is an option I'm seriously considering if I have to quit/the school closes.  I don't know if Taiwan, Japan, or Thailand have less than one-year contracts but I'm going to try and find out as I would certainly consider moving to one of those countries to teach for a few months.  The only downside to this is that most other countries don't pay as well as Korean schools do, so switching to another school in another country would probably (but not definitely) mean less income generated in the long run (even if you consider the loss of a bonus here in Korea.)  It's all so very complicated!  I haven't hit the automatic eject button yet, and am trying to remain positive and level-headed, but am prepared to do just that if need be.  Really, I just want to make sure that I have options if indeed the shit does hit the fan.  No matter what it won't be an easy or simple decision, so I really have to be careful with what I choose in the end.  But I mean hey maybe these new changes will actually make things *better* at work and I may end up liking them.  And then all of this uncertainty and stress will just be a distant memory.  I just want to make sure that I'm prepared for whatever comes my way.  Any suggestions?  I'd love to hear any advice you may have...

      So I can't express to you enough how frustrating it is not being able to use the internet at home!  This fucking virus has rendered my computer near useless and I feel so helpless about it.  I'm not very good with computers myself but have tried numerous options to try and get it up and running again.  The fact that everything is in Korean makes it especially difficult.  Trying to figure stuff out is like trying to feel your way out of a dark room, at best.    Last night I somehow managed to get Messenger working briefly, and it was on there I ran into my dear friend Cindy in Thunder Bay.  Her and I spent a good 2 hours plus fiddling around with stuff (she guided me on what to try via our conversation on Messenger, and I also had her on the phone!)  Well no matter what we tried we couldn't seem to get things back up and running.  The virus has apparently been quarantined in my computer, but Explorer is still royally fucked up.  We even tried re-installing Explorer...but nothing seems to work.  :-(  At this point I've given up on the damn thing.  It's obvious that I'm not going to be able to fix the situation myself (even with the guidance of a computer expert, from thousands of kilometres away.)  I'll have to go to Steven and ask him for help, which will probably mean either having someone professional come in and fix it, or have the computer sent somewhere.  I'm hoping for a quick solution but chances are I'll be without home internet access for quite some time.  I FEEL SO PARALYZED WITHOUT MY COMPUTER!!!  This is both extremely stressful and amusing to me.  Having internet at home gives me access to my email, my friends online, my blog....it's my connection to the outside world.  Having that removed leaves me feeling disconnected, disenchanted, and downright bored at home!  I've been having to use the computer at the office after school hours and it's been a real pain in the ass.  I've been stressed lately because of what's going on at work and having no computer just compounds everything!  Argh!  It's amusing to me at the same time because it so clearly illustrates how dependent we silly humans are on these fickle machines.  One little virus has left me with no computer access at all and makes me feel so frustrated I'm foaming at the mouth.  It sort of reminds me of last summer when one little overheated electrical switch in Ohio left half of North America without power for several days.    We really do live in a fragile world.  Our technological creations are amazing and brilliant and have given us so many luxuries and possibilities in life, but their failure leaves us completely helpless and lost.  It really is a knife that cuts both ways.  We are so dependent upon these stupid/wonderful machines for carrying out our day-to-day lives that we can barely function without them.  It's an amusing and frustrating situation at its smallest scale, extremely disruptive and potentially dangerous at the largest scale.    Anyway, in the meantime please be patient with me.  The blog will likely be sporadic for the next little while, and it may take me a while to get back to personal emails.  And I also apologize to everyone who's conversation on Messenger I may have abandoned suddenly in the last few days.  Really, it's not my fault!!!    Argh!!!

      Well the changes at school are happening already...  I walked into work today, and saw that all the tables in one of the classrooms have been changed from 'kiddie tables' to individual adult-sized tables.  Yes, soon my kindergartens will be gone and in their place will be adults.  This school is going to be so different afterwards...  Steven tracked me down in the afternoon and we had another long chat during my one hour mid-day coffee break.  The changes we mentioned last week are definitely happening, he confirmed everything.  This is my last week with my lil kinders and they will be gone at the end of the week.  Again, knowing this made me really sad!  Yes, they can drive a teacher up the wall occasionally (last Friday being a PRIME example!) but I really do love 'em and they're my favourites.  I look forward to teaching them everyday - unlike my elementary classes which can sometimes be dull, my kinders are never boring!  So apparently we're going to have two different types of adult classes - one for housewives, and one for business men/nurses/office workers.  There's a lot of both in this part of the city and according to Steven no other nearby schools cater to them, so there should be lots of potential.  He even said that a few adults have signed up already, which makes things sound really promising.  I'm kinda curious to see what it will be like teaching adults, but the one thing I am concerned about is hours.  Right now my work day is from 10am-6pm, and I only teach about 5-6 hours a day.  This is what was agreed upon in my contract and it's been a *great* schedule so far.  Well it looks like that may change...  No official schedule has been set yet, but in order to cater to the various groups of adults we have to split the classes into a morning group and an evening group.  Steven mentioned that the morning group may start as early as 7:30am and the evening classes may run from 7-9pmish.  Hearing this DID NOT impress me! One of the reasons that I took this particular job was because it had an attractive schedule.  I am NOT a morning person at all (even after 4 years at Delany's, I still *hated* getting up early) and I'll pretty much refuse to work anything earlier than 9am or so.  As for the evening classes, well I don't mind those so much because it's not like I do anything at night anyways - I'm just at home watching TV.    I guess what I need to express to Steven is that I'll work morning adult classes (as long as they're not at some ungodly hour like what he mentioned) OR I'll work the evening classes, but certainly NOT both.  I am NOT going to work from 7:30am - 9pm, even if there are large breaks in between.  That would be annoying, frustrating, and downright inconsiderate of my life outside of work, if you ask me!  I don't want THE WHOLE DAY to be teaching.  Steven seemed to reassure me that I wasn't going to get some horrible schedule, and that we'd work out one together that was pleasing for all, but I'm really skeptical at this point.  Argh!!!!  All of this is making me NOT a happy camper!  It's hard to be mad at Steven because in so many other ways he's been the ideal boss.  Him and his family have been so unbelievably nice to me and have really gone out of their way to make me feel welcome and comfortable here in Korea.  After hearing lots of horror stories about bosses who leave their foreign teachers pretty much to fend for themselves regarding anything and everything outside of work, I know I've been really lucky with my bosses in that regard.  However,  I am only flexible/patient to a certain degree, and I have to remember to take care of my needs as well - not just those of Steven, the school, and the kids.  We agreed to certain terms in the contract before I came here, and it looks like many of them are no longer being held.  Again, I can't really be mad at him for this because it's all been circumstances that is sorta out of everyone's hands (ie: the financial situation at school is largely reflective of the fact that Korea has been in a recession for the last few years and many hagwons have been having money problems.)  He's not a bad boss and he's not malicious or out to take advantage of me.  Things are shitty for him too and he's just trying his best to keep things afloat.  That's why it's been really hard for me to be upset or inflexible with the changes.    I really don't know what to do at this point.  I feel so torn!  I guess right now, because nothing has really happened yet, all I can do is just see how it all plays out.  The next few weeks and the next month will really tell if things are going to work out in the end.  The school may recover but if it comes at the expense of me working crazy hours, I am willing to walk away.  I don't want to, but that's just may what have to happen.  I hate being put in this sort of position, but that's just how life operates sometimes.  I just need to make sure that I stay level-headed and make smart choices.  Wish me luck!

      (bonus points if you can name the next line in this Counting Crows song!)  After our long sleep, we felt really alive and energized today and wanted to spend more time outdoors again.  Steve suggested that we all go and hang out in Bukhansan National Park again for the day and we thought that sounded like a great idea!  (Bukhansan is the park that we went hiking in about a month and a half ago.)  We packed up a picnic lunch and the 5 of us went to the park (me, Brad, Steve, Andrea, and Megan also came along.)  It was another sunny clear day and Bukhansan was looking as spectacular as ever.  The park actually looked even more beautiful this visit because of the fact that things are green now thanks to spring.  Last time we were there it was all rather brown, but this day it was unbelievable green and lush and the colours were all so vivid!  The trees are just SO GREEN it's hard to explain.  It was almost how I imagined tropical Vietnam to look or something.  We hiked into the park and made our way down into the canyon/river bed that runs off one of the mountain peaks.  We camped down next to this small waterfall and babbling brook and it was a perfect place for our picnic lunch.  We ate lunch and then spent the afternoon reading in the sun (we all brought books, yeah we're geeks!) and playing frisbee (which is quite a challenge to play in a rocky riverbed!)  Both Steve and Brad are avid rock climbers, so they entertained us with several climbing stunts on local rocks and even up the waterfall!  What a wonderful afternoon just hanging out with friends in nature!  It's almost hard to believe that we're right next door to Seoul, the park feels so removed...  We spent ALL DAY next to the river and then hiked back down in the early evening after we ran out of food.  We went back to Insadong and had a delicious dinner at this restaurant called Torros, located at the LaFesta mall near where they live.  I ordered this gourmet shrimp and prawn cream sauce spaghetti dish and it was HEAVENLY!  The flavours were unbelievable and it was quite possibly my best restaurant meal yet here in Korea!  After dinner it was time to head back to my corner of suburbia.  I said goodbye to all my buds and it was back on the bus for me (yah, MORE time on the bus, just what I was dreaming about!)  My weekends here are awesome, but they go way too fast!  I wish I could freeze time!  At least I felt really rested after this weekend, and after such a shitty week last week I really needed to have a good weekend.  Luckily it came through!  Let's hope I can survive the next week....oh boy....

      First off, I want to apologize for the severe delay in updating my blog.  The evil computer virus that has entered my helpless computer has taken it over completely, rendering it pretty much useless.  I have no computer at the moment!  I am at work right now and will have have to restrict my computer time to such until I am able to get my computer repaired.  I have no idea how long this will take (I'm going to ask Steven about it) but please bare with me in the meantime!  This past weekend turned out to be one of my best yet here in Korea!  On Friday night I made my way over to Brad's place again to spend the weekend there (seems like I'm a regular houseguest there now!)  I've been really impressed that I've been able to shorten my travel time down to just over 2 hours, from my door to his.  Considering that the journey used to take 3 hours, this is quite a significant improvement!  And now I only take 2 busses, and 1 train, whereas before it was 1 bus, 4 trains, and a taxi.  Whew...living in a megacity can be exhausting sometimes!  We spent Friday night with all of us just hanging out at Brad's watching movies and pigging out on junk food.  Good times!  We woke up really early on Saturday because we had plans to travel to Gangwha Island which is just off shore, close to Incheon.  We all thought that a day out in nature outside of the city would be nice, and plus it would be cool to see the ocean.  I was really excited for this because not only have I not seen the ocean since when I arrived at the airport, but I haven't been outside of the city yet either.    The journey to the island took MUCH longer than we thought it would.  Our final destination was actually another smaller island accessed only by ferry from Gangwha Island, and it was not all that far in distance but traffic in the city was slow-moving and we had to keep transferring busses.  It took 4 busses, one ferry ride, and about 3 hours to get there!  God in that time we could've hopped on the KTX high speed train in Seoul and have been at the *other end of the country* in the same amount of time!  It was a long gruelling journey but it was well worth it in the end.  Both islands were really pretty - lots of green hillsides, farmland, and beautiful views of the West Sea.  When we got off that last bus I just stopped and took a deep breath....ahhhhh.....I can breathe now!  After 2.5 months of breathing nothing but Seoul's polluted city air it was such a pleasure to be out in the fresh air.  (My lungs were thanking me!)  And it was lush and green and just so *quiet* out there - really lovely!  We had lunch at this nearby Korean restaurant and then made our way to the island's temple.  The temple is really the only thing to see on this island, but it's a beautiful temple in a spectacular location so it draws flocks of people from the city every weekend.  To get to the temple you have to walk up this long, STEEP road up the side of the mountain.  At the top is the temple complex, consisting of one large and 3 small temples.  The view of the ocean and surrounding forests from this point is breathtaking!  In the complex there was also a grotto - the first one I've ever seen.  It was originally a natural cave in the rock but it's been enlarged so that they've been able to build a small temple *inside* the cave, all lit aglow with hundreds of tiny candles.  I would've loved to have taken a photo so you could see but because it's a religious centre, with many people inside praying, it would have been extremely disrespectful to have done so.    Behind the large temple we found a staircase leading way way WAY up the side of the mountain.  Making our way to the top was quite a strenuous journey but it was so scenic that we didn't mind.  All along the staircase are hundreds of colourful lanters which must look absolutely incredible when they're all lit up at night!  When we got to the top of the stairs, what lay in waiting made it all worth while!    At the top was a very large image of Buddha carved into the side of the mountain!  It's under a large rock overhang that looks like it's going to break off any second, and to get to it you have to walk very carefully along this narrow path.  The image is the largest Buddha image I've ever seen, and all along his feet are many candles and presents left for him by the many worshippers who come up to pray and chant.  Buddha stares out over the island out to the ocean and it really is a most magical setting for such a sacred site.  We made our way back down to the bottom after this, and even though we had only been at the site for about 2 or 3 hours, we decided that we should head back home because of the long travel time.  When we got back down to the temple complex we ran into a class of about 15 kids who were all *absolutely enthralled* to see us foreigners on the island.  They surrounded us and stared in amazement, and giggled whenever we attempted Korean or said "Hello!" to them.  A few of them spoke a few words of English, and they laughed hysterically when we made funny faces to entertain them.   Ahhh, the life of a rock star....er, I mean English Teacher.  :-)  It took EVEN LONGER to get home if you can believe it!  Traffic on the highways were terrible and it took more than 3 hours just to get back into Seoul (never mind to Insandong!)  We all had a nap on the bus hoping that when we woke up we'd be almost in the city.  Well we slept for about an hour or so but were so disappointed when we woke up to see that we had barely moved!  Gridlock on the highways in Korea can be a real pain the ass!    By the time we got into Seoul we were all very hungry, so we made a b-line to a nearby Outback Steakhouse cause we were all craving a giant fatty Western meal.  Outbacks are *extremely popular* in Korea (as are all Tony Romas, TGI Friday's, and any major Western chain) and the wait for a table was an hour. To kill time we hung out and walked around, and checked out the really cool shopping to be found in Shinchon (the local neighbourhood.)  The streets were really busy and alive, and filled with young people as there are at least 3 major universities nearby here.  By the time we had dinner we were famished, so it tasted REALLY GOOD!    By the time we got back to Brad's it wasn't even all that late, but we were all pretty tired from our long day travelling so we decided just to have another 'night in.'  We watched TV, jammed on the guitar for a bit (well, Brad and Steve did), ate more ice cream (what else is new!) and then went to bed. I slept like the dead that night - guess my body's not used to breathing fresh clean air anymore!

      All I can say is THANK GOD IT'S FRIDAY!!!  Next to my week when I first arrived in Korea, this week has probably been my most stressful.  Between trying to track down my boss for a few days, and then finally being able to sit down with him only to find out about the big changes coming up, and basically deducing that the coffers are close to running dry here at REI, and then my HELLISH morning with the kindergartens this morning, I am *SO READY* for the weekend!  And a stiff drink on top of that!  Oh bartender, where art thou?  Here's what happened this morning with the kindergartens.  My class with the 7's were all fine and dandy, and then came my class with the 5's.  Now as much as I love my 5's, they are certainly a handful even on the best of days.  They're SO YOUNG that their attention span barely lasts more than a minute, and they rarely understand anything I say to them.  (a: they understand VERY little English, and b: they just don't want to listen) so because of this there is *always* a Korean in the room with me.  Laura is the kindergarten teacher at my school who is always there to help me with the 5's, both with translating what I'm saying, and also just to take care of the class.  She is like a mother to the little darlings/hellions in that class and I really depend on her.  Trust me, you do need two teachers to run this class even though there's only four students in it.  Well when I walked into the class today Laura was nowhere to be found.  Thinking that she was just busy with something at the moment, I waited a few minutes for her to show up, but she never did.  So, not wanting to distract her with whatever she was doing, and confident that she would show up 'any minute' - and also wanting to prove that I could run this class on my own - I started it without her.  It was a rocky start right off the bat.  The kids' prior class to this one is a colouring one, and you should try and separate a 5 year-old from their crayons when they *really* don't want to!  It ain't easy!  Three of them complied but one of them broke out into a screaming/bawling fit and began to throw her papers around.  Lovely.  She calmed down a few minutes later though and in less than five minutes she was happily placing her coloured stickers in the right spots for my lesson.  All seemed to be going well at this point - I was holding things together alright.  Well it was all a very precarious balance and about 2/3 of the way into the class all hell broke loose.  The kids just seemed to telepathically unite and decide that they had had enough of this lesson and that it would be more fun to run amok in the classroom.  Billy (the girl who had pulled the Mariah Carey breakdown when I took away her crayons earlier) bolted out of the classroom and I had to chase her down the hall and drag her back in.  She just seemed to think this was a big game and it was a struggle to get her back in the class (they may be little, but they're fast and squirmy, those 5 years olds!)  I attempted to calm things down, and did manage to get them all to sit in their chairs again, but trying to restart the lesson was like trying to start a car engine in -45 C weather.  It just wasn't going to happen, try as I may.   This is when things got REALLY BAD.  Billy made another bolt for the door, but this time I managed to grab her and prevent her from escaping out into the hall again.  She was protesting profusely in Korean (meaningless to me, but it's all she can communicate in) and I thought she just didn't want to come back to class.  Turns out that she *REALLY* had to go to the bathroom and was mere seconds away from peeing her pants.  If it wasn't for the lucky timing of another teacher who just happened to be walking by, and heard her pleas for the bathroom, she probably would've peed her pants right there on the spot.  At this moment I turned and looked back into the class to see Terry bawling his eyes out for no apparent reason, and Fred and Chris chasing each other around the room running and screaming....  Seriously, at that moment I just about lost it...  WHERE THE FUCK WAS LAURA!!!???    I took two seconds to take a deep breath, calm myself down, and just plunged right into damage control.  I comforted Terry and he stopped crying (never did find out what caused the tragedy) and managed to at least slow down Fred and Chris, who weren't going to return to their seats for love or money or candy or stickers.  Billy returned a minute later, (dry, thank god!) and basically at that point I realized that returning to the lesson was a lost cause.  I was pretty pissed off that I was left on my own in the one class where the students understand me the least.  The rest of the class was then just spent 'killing time' until that elusive bell finally rang....  That class was the longest half hour of my life!  On my way out to lunch (right after this class) I passed by the office to see Laura in there doing...photocopying!!!???  *THIS* is the dire emergency that kept her out of my classroom and left me abandoned against the 5 year old savages?  What the fuck!?  In all honesty I actually wasn't mad at her - Laura is super nice and always extremely helpful in classes.  If she was in that office doing photocopying I'm sure it's because she *had* to (most likely an order from higher up, ie: Steven)  It was another example though of how stretched things are becoming at my school.  Another episode like this and I'll be ready to tear a strip off of someone.  This is no way to run a school.  What the hell is going on at REI this week?  My once-awesome school just seems to be falling apart at the seems in the last two weeks!  Again, all I can say is Thank God It's The Fucking Weekend!  AND WHERE'S MY DAMN DRINK???  :-)

      One thing about not understanding Korean and therefore never *really* knowing what's going on at your school is that sometimes you get wonderful surprises.  I walked into work this morning all expecting to jump right into classes, but was told there's be no teaching this morning.  Instead we'd have a half-day birthday party!  They organized a big birthday celebration for 4 of our students who all have birthdays that are close together - Paul, Lina, Mandy, and Billy.  So cool!  A big fuss was made over the birthday kids and the playroom had been transformed into a birthday party room with balloons and a big birthday sign and cake and goodies and all sorts of good stuff.  The 4 birthday kids were also dressed up in costume - Paul was in a suit and the 3 girls were in these traditional Korean dresses and they all looked SO CUTE!!!  They were parading themselves around the school showing off their fancy clothes and had the biggest smile on their faces.  We all played games and watched videos and horsed around together having fun.    I made up another game today that the kids instantly loved - The 'Don't Steal My Baby' Game.  I shoved a balloon under my shirt to make it look like I was pregnant and then rubbed my stomach exclaiming how much I 'love my baby' in this feminine motherly voice that made the kids giggle.  Well the game became to chase me around the room and try to yank the balloon out from under my shirt.  I would pretend to be frantic and frightened and would clutch my stomach screaming (still in the motherly voice) "Don't steal my baby!"  Eventually one of them would get the balloon out and I'd pretend to be horrified and devestated.  The kids ate it up like candy and laughed their asses off - this was the biggest hit by far since the introduction of 'The Claw'.  They absolutely loved it!  (and yes, I'm weird!)  We then had a bit of a 'formal' birthday celebration - each of the birthday kids had to stand and sing this song for the classes, and then several of the students would give them a present.  It was so cute!  Then it was lunch time - and we had quite the birthday feast today.  There was bananas and strawberries, Korean rice cake, fried chicken, kimbok (sorta a Korean version of sushi) and a giant chocolate birthday cake.  YUM!  It was fun to sit and eat with all the kids and we all had such fun this morning!  Gotta love birthday parties, eh?  :-)

      So in the last week or so Steven has been really inaccessible and not overly friendly at work.  I wasn't sure if it was because maybe I've done something wrong, or I've unknowingly offended him in some way, or that he wasn't pleased with my performance as a teacher, or maybe just because he's perpetually over-worked and stressed out and so busy keeping the school running.  Well after trying unsuccessfully to have a chat with him in the last few days (he's always coming and going, never around, always busy with something else that I don't want to interrupt) I finally got the chance to chat with him over coffee this morning at the office before work started.  And I didn't even have to bring it up - he initiated the conversation all on his own....  So there's good news and there's bad news....  The good news is that everything is fine with me! (ie: he's not upset with me, thinks I'm doing great in the classroom, etc.)  He apologized for being so busy lately and for not being around to help me teach the afternoon classes which I had been pretty much doing all on my own for the last week and a half.  He also apologized for being late (again!) with my pay.  Payday was last Thursday (the 15th) and he's promised to pay me *in full* next Friday...here's hoping he comes through with that promise!  It's not that I'm desperate for money or starving at home or anything, but I'm just not comfortable with the informality of pay around here.  I'm used to getting paid exactly on the same day every single time - I don't know if it's just my school or maybe Korea in general but they seem to be a lot more lax about pay schedules and stuff around here...  Anyways, here's the bad news (although it may turn out to be good news in the end...)  REI, I believe, is having financial problems.  Steven didn't say this himself, but I've pieced this together based on what's happened in the last few weeks, and what he announced today (I'll get to that in a minute.)  When I first arrived at REI there were 4 Korean teachers and me teaching the kids.  We're now down to 2 Korean teachers and me, have merged our 6's and 7's together into one classroom (a pain in the ass, as they each have separate lessons still but the fact that the two tables are right next to each other means they're constantly distracting each other - it makes classroom management that much more difficult) and we've lost about 1/4 of our students it seems in the last 2 months.  Our classes are getting smaller, and this, I assume, is why they've been letting teachers go.  And they've been late for both of my paydays so far which leads me to believe that the school is seriously short on cash these days.     So the big announcement is that REI is going to change it's education program in the mornings.  We're losing our kindergarten classes completely and will instead begin to teach adults in the morning.  Afternoon elementary classes will stay the same (I assume.)  All our kindergartens will be sent to another school in May, and the school will begin advertising it's new program for parents/adults immediately.  This is both sad news and possibly good news.  If it means a better financial situation for the school (and as a result, for me as well) then it's good news for sure.  But in the process both our remaining kindergarten teachers will be let go, and I'll have to say goodbye to all my kinders!!!  I've really grown attached to them and even though they can be quite difficult to teach at times, they're absolutely adorable and I still love 'em to pieces!  I'm honestly going to be really sad to have to say goodbye to all of them knowing that I'll probably never see any of them again.  But, like I said, if this improves the financial situation for the school then I guess in the big picture this is a good thing.  Teaching adults will be *very* different for me, but I'm kinda looking forward to it at the same time.  When teaching adults, you get to focus 100% of your time on teaching English, not trying to balance lessons with 'baby-sitting'.  The adults will be there because they *want* to learn and are paying for it themselves, and I'll no longer have to deal with crying, fighting, marker/cookie/pencil stealing, name-calling, or just trying to get the kids to sit and LISTEN.  But, I will no longer have students running up and giving me hugs every morning, drawing me pictures, giving me little candies as presents, sitting on my lap or cuddling during movie or reading time, or fun little games where I get to see their eyes light up.  There's nothing really that I can do other than to just 'roll with the changes' and hope that things work out for our school.  I've been considering the worst case scenario which is that the school has to close and I therefore lose my job.  As much as this would suck, I'm actually not too worried about it.  There's TONS of teaching jobs here in Korea, and between Steven's connections and all those schools that my friends work at, I'm pretty sure I could find a new job quite quickly.  Still, I want to avoid that as it would be a big paperwork hassle, and I'd have to move, and start all over again, and I just really like being at my school with my students.  I'm going to stay positive though and hope that all of this works out.  Steven seems pretty confident it will, and I have faith in him that he has my best interests at heart and is looking out for me too.  Still, I'm going to be mentally prepared in case the worst case scenario does occur.  With all luck, this new education program will bring in lots of adult students and therefore lots of income for the school.  Who knows - perhaps in a month or two from now all of this worry will be a distant memory and things will be flourishing at REI.  Until then, I'm just handling it all one day at a time.

      So I got the best mail delivery EVER today!!!    A CARE PACKAGE FROM HOME!!!    Courtesy of the wonderful and amazing Ginny & Ron Strey!  You guys are my heroes and totally made my week!!!  You have no idea how excited getting this in the mail made me feel!  haha!  The timing was absolutely perfect!  I had just finished talking to my Mom and Dad on the phone back in Thunder Bay about how surprised we all were that the care package hadn't arrived yet.  (Ginny & Ron had told me they had mailed it in March so I knew it was coming - talk about 6 weeks of anticipation!)  No more than 10 minutes or so after I had gotten off the phone with them there was a knock at my door.  Sure enough I opened it to see Mr. Mail Man there with a big box with my name on it!!    I ripped it open like a savage beast immediately and started to drool when I saw the contents - it was all my favourite foods that I have been missing!  My uber-awesome care package included:  -4 boxes of Kraft Dinner -NutriGrain bars -Swiss Cheese Crackers -RitzBitz Sandwiches with cheese -3 packages of Lipton Sidekicks instant noodles -a package of Lipton Sidekicks scalloped potatoes -a package of Mexican rice seasoning mix -a package of Ranch Salad dressing mix -2 OhHenry! Easter eggs -AND 2 PACKAGES OF CADBURY MINI EGGS!!!!  MY GOD!!!  WHAT MORE COULD A MAN ASK FOR!!!  :-)  This wave of ecstacy that has washed over me must feel exactly what it's like for the participants on Survivor when they win a food challenge!  You *crave* certain foods like you can't imagine as soon as you're removed from them, and the fact that you just can't get them is enough to fuel food dreams at night of eating all your favourites.  I've never been so excited to eat!  All afternoon at work I couldn't wait to get home and have dinner.  When I finally got home I made myself some Kraft Dinner and it was  the best fucking Kraft Dinner  that I've ever had!  Dear God I never knew something could taste so good!  And it's just beginning...I have enough treats here to last me a while, and I'm going to savour and seduce oh-so-slowly and thoroughly every last morsel that came in that Box From Heaven.  Yay!!!  God, to think of all those *thousands of kilometres* that those little food boxes and packages travelled just to get to me!  A huge car-ride across North America and then a long, LONG boat ride across the giant Pacific...  Wow!  (Those boxes of KD travelled further than what most people venture in their lifetimes!)  Thank you again Ginny & Ron!  You guys totally made my week and you're my new favourite AllStars!  One day when I'm rich and famous you guys can be sure that you will not be forgotten!  ;-)  HOORAY FOR CARE PACKAGES!

      Adbusters is probably the coolest magazine in the entire world.  It's a magazine that publishes articles and photography regarding the state of the world in regards to critiquing mass media, the environment, corportations, governments and politicians, and the lives of everyday citizens.  It's a magazine that empowers and challenges, that criticizes and supports, that tears down and gives birth, that essentially changes the way you see the world.  It's shocking and it's provocative and it's controversial and it's brilliant.  It's the kind of magazine that everyone in the world needs to read.    Anyways, while hanging out at Brad's this weekend I came across the Nov/Dec 2003 issue and was thrilled to have the chance to read it as it's been many months since I've seen one.  Brad let me borrow it, and while reading it today during my afternoon break I came across a really interesting opinion article that someone, who's living in South Korea, wrote in describing the state of life here in Korea.  It sums up very succinctly (sp?) and eloquently a cross-section of Korean society.  It's not exactly a happy article, but pretty much everything he writes is true, or so it seems to me.  It really struck a chord with me and so I wanted to share it with you.  Enjoy, and ponder.  "In South Korea we have a dynamic western-capitalist economy mixed up with, amont other things: pervasive corporate power, geopolitical merit, a beligerent enemy-brother to the north, megacity centrism, 37,000 American GI's, retreating labor unions, Confucian customs, a national inferiority complex, CNN, Budweiser, Tommy Hilfiger and an absolute (American) English obsession.  Just outside every crammed apartment complex: drafted soldiers in fatigues with brand name boutique bags, miniature mannequins and all the same coats, $8.00 cappuccino, sidewalk fish half price and everyone's eating from the same dish.  Drunkenness is fashionable (is an art form).  Jaywalking's a mortal sin, computer games are careers.  Digital countdowns at pedestrian crosswalks and everybody's late.  Five thousand years of history, five years to western conversion.  Family may come first, but corporate juggernauts make sure every last member gives what they've got to keep the ship afloat.  Every male over 21 is deadly with an assault rifle and red neon crosses bless half the buildings on the block since Buddha was gunned down by steel-and-glass Christianity.  The Korean language, however ingenious, draws secondary ad space, making way for poorly-understood English slogans.  Products and retail outlets have English names.  Ingredients, directions, manufacturers, warnings, assembly instructions and menus are necessarily Korean; brand names are always English.  And one more thing: in South Korea, golf's not a game; it's a style and a business obligation.  In America, vice-presidents play golf.   Get your clubs, son."  -Gregg Blakey, South Korea

      Another wonderful lazy day!  Andrea cooked french toast for Steve, Brad and I this morning and it was really yummy - another Western treat that I have not had in ages.  Steve then went and met up with Megan (I've recently been informed that they're secretly dating - hehe!) and we all made plans to meet up in Seoul later on.  Brad, Andrea and I got showered and packed up and then took the bus back into the city.    We went to Yeouido Island to just go and hang out and watch Jess play ultimate frisbee with her team.  Steve and Megan were already there when we got there, and Kelsey joined us later on as well.  It was kinda dark today from clouds and a lot of air pollution but it was still really warm outside.  Brad, Steve and I played several hours of frisbee and it was awesome!  One of the girls from the practicing ultimate teams tried to recruit us to come and play with them but we were all too self-conscious to go and play 'with the pros' so we just had our own fun on the sides.  I actually think it would be kinda fun to join the Seoul Ultimate Frisbee League but as much as I enjoy tossing around a frisbee, I've never actually played 'Ultimate' before and aren't exactly the most athletic sporty kinda guy.  Still, it does look like fun...  It was a great afternoon just hanging out in the park and chatting with everyone, and playing frisbee with the boys.  Before we knew it it was late afternoon, so we all headed on over to Kyobo Bookshop to browse around there for a while.  Kyobo is one of our favourite places in the city and it's the kind of store that you can visit often because you always find something new there.  It's probably the biggest book store that I've ever seen in my life, but the Foreign Books section is quite small - the rest are all in Korean.  After the bookstore it was time for - you guessed it! - ice cream and we wandered through this really cool outdoor art exhibit.  Some artist has taken scarp pieces of metal and constructed giant 'warriors' based on the animals of all the Chinese Zodiac signs - really neat looking!!!  It was almost dinner time by then and the gang all had to head back to Ilsan.  I said my goodbyes and decided to slowly make my way home by walking all the way to Seoul Station to catch my Line 1 train instead of just hopping on the nearest subway train.  It was so pleasant to be outside and with all the blooming flowers and lilac trees it actually *smelled really nice* to be downtown!  (This is something I almost never say as the smells of Korea tend to be...well...let's just say less pleasant than lilacs!)  I walked down the street through the heart of downtown and it was fun just to take in all the hustle and bustle of Seoul.  All the cars, the tall buildings, the historic statues and monuments, and the giant TV screen billboards make it exciting to just walk around.  The TV screens are especially mesmerizing!  They're bright and dazzling and constantly changing like a video game and are just so completely MASSIVE!  At one intersection, while waiting for the light, I could actually see FOUR of these giant electronic media advertising phenomenas!  It's like being in 'Back To The Future' or something!  When I got to Seoul Station I was starving for dinner so I went and had some rice and vegetables from the food court there (a full healthy delicious meal for only 5000Won - about $6 CDN!) and then took the train home.  My weekends always go by SO FAST!  I wish they lasted longer!  It's not that I don't like my job or anything, but it's just that I have so much fun on the weekends that I really do live for them.  This work week coming up is a full 5-dayer too - no holidays this week!  Bleh!  ;-)

      Okay, so I'm starting, or let me say re-starting, this blog entry by saying how much I HATE COMPUTERS!!! My computer has a fucking virus in it and it's been causing some havoc and pissing me off big time.  I just finished typing out a nice detailed entry for this day only to have the computer fuck up and lose it all!!!!  I WAS SO MAD!!!!!!!  And trying to get rid of this virus is going to be a pain in the ass because my entire computer (and I do mean EVERYTHING) is in Korean so it's like trying to feel your way through the dark.  Even so I'm pretty useless when it comes to computers so even if this was in English I'd still have problems trying to fix it.  Argh!!!!!!!!!!!  Well on that happy note, let me return to RETYPE OUT AGAIN my weekend adventures.  This weekend was a really lazy one, but a really nice kind of lazy.  I met up with Brad, Andrea, Amy, and Pauline for lunch at the Subway in Itaewon, but because we all live so far out of the city by the time we all got down there it was 3pm!  Half the day gone already!  We then spent the afternoon just hanging out in Itaewon doing some window-shopping and eating ice cream - our current obsession.  I have to say that it's always *very* disorienting being in Itaewon because of all the foreigners there.  Everywhere you look there's Caucasians walking around and it always causes me to do a double-take, and think "Where am I?  What country is this?"  I'm just not used to seeing so many white people together any more!  I can wander around Shihung for days and not ever see a foreigner.  Hell, the amount of times I've seen foreigners in Shihung during the whole time I've been here I can count on one hand!  90% of the foreigners in Itaewon are GI's (army guys) from the nearby base and believe me when I say that they sure make their presence known.  Most of us teachers (and most non-military foreigners in Korea) dislike the GI's - they're loud, rude, obnoxious, arrogant, are always causing a scene on the street, and I hate to say it, but they seem to embody and exemplify every single bad stereotype of Americans that you can think of.  Honestly, you can hear them coming down the street before you see them.  And this is when they're sober!  You should see what Itaewon is like at night during the weekends!  The whole area becomes this giant frat party filled with GI's who are running around absolutely shittered and causing a ruckus.  It's like when they're drunk they have the intellect and maturity of a 16 year-old who's gotten drunk for the very first time on his parent's stash of booze stolen from the cupboard.  I'm sure many of them are nice guys, but their behavior can often be just so obnoxious and so embarrassing that it's enough to make you THANK GOD that you're not American and associated with them.  So the weather has been absolutely beautiful lately!  I don't know what the temperatures have been, but this Saturday it felt like it was at least 20 C outside.  It was the perfect weather to be out and about in the sun and I love it.  It's funny to think that just 2 weekends ago when I was at the Cherry Blossom Festival I wore a touque in the afternoon because it was kind of chilly that day, and now you can get away with just wearing a t-shirt, shorts, and sandals!  What a massive and rapid change in weather!  I wish I could 'put a cap' on the rising temps because I know in just a month or so summer will be here, along with the supposed disgustingly hot and humid weather that Korea is known for.  Right now the weather is perfect though and I plan on enjoying it while it's still comfortable to be outside.  We decided to go on over to the Jonggak area so we hopped in a cab and made our way over to that part of Seoul.  When we got there the taxi driver let us out right in front of Chongo Tower - that crazy unusual futuristic Dr.Evil headquarters skyscraper that I've mentioned before.  Brad informed us that you can actually go up to the lobby of the restaurant at the very top and enjoy the view for free, so that's what we did!  The view was amazing but it was so freaky being up there!  The restaurant is literally suspended between 3 support beams that rise up a good 10 stories or so above the 'roof' of the building.  Criss-crossing the 'hole' of the circular restaurant are these mid-air walkways that allow you to look out and down to the city way below - SO SCARY!!!  It honestly feels as if the entire thing could collapse any second!  And ladies, if you ever go up to the top of Chongo Tower, be sure to make a pit stop in the washroom up there.  Apparently in the ladies room one whole wall of the washroom is glass, so that you can actually enjoy a magnificent view of the city WHILE YOU'RE SITTING ON THE CAN!  Wow!  How cool is that!?  We killed some time hanging out around there before Brad and Andrea went to go and see their movie.  They were going to see 'The Passion of the Christ' and I was invited to join them but I have no interest whatsoever in seeing that film.  It's not because of the religious content, I'd actually be quite curious to see it just for 'historical interests' but I've heard that it's very graphic and violent and I'm just too squeamish when it comes to stuff like that.  Watching nails being driven through Jesus' hands just doesn't sound like a fun way to spend 2 hours, if you ask me.  I, instead, headed over to the Starbucks to sit and read until they finished the film.  I was all prepared to be by myself for a few hours, but I wasn't alone for very long...  I had only been sitting there for maybe half an hour or so, when this this 20-something Korean girl came up and sat next to me.  I wasn't sure what she wanted at first so I just sat there and waited for her to do something.  She kept trying to catch my eye and then she finally broke the ice by asking me what I was reading.  Well anyways she was super nice and we spent the next hour and a half just chatting away!  It's not uncommon for Korean strangers to come up and speak to you cause they want to practice their  English, but this was the longest conversation I've had with a Korean stranger by far!  She wanted to hear all about life in Canada so I told her all about the beautiful wonders and splendour of Vancouver and she sat there wide-eyed, 'oohhing' and 'ahhing' at all my vivid descriptions.  We both had the same tastes in cheesy pop music, so since I had my discman with me, I suggested that we listen to some music.  She thought this was a great idea!  We totally got into and were rockin' out and singing along to my music, attracting many a strange looks from other patrons but having too much fun to care.    Brad, Andrea, Steve, and their friends Megan and Jess showed up later on and were quite surprised to see me boppin' away with some strange Korean girl!  haha!  It was time for dinner so I said goodbyes to my new friend Hyung-Kyung and we headed out.  The 6 of us went to a nearby Bennigan's and had a really yummy dinner.  I had never been to Bennigan's before (a US chain?) and was thrilled to be presented with a menu filled with dozens of choices - all food that I recognized!  This was only my second time eating at a proper sit-down Western restaurant since arriving and it was sooooo good!  After dinner we all took the bus back to Ilsan to play Scrabble at Brad's but by the time we got there everyone was so tired.  Megan and Jess went home and Brad, Andrea, Steve and I watched 'Jackie Brown', but we all fell asleep during the film.  Bedtime ensued shortly after that!  P.S. HAVE I MENTIONED HOW MUCH I FUCKING HATE COMPUTERS!!!!!!!!!!!  ;-)  (Sorry - I need to vent and I live alone so there's no one here to listen to me rant!  Just had to get it out one last time.)

      It was kinda weird going back to work this morning after being off for a day - but hey it's only one day of work and then it's the weekend again!  Well, it turned out to only be a half-day and then it's the weekend again...  When I arrived at REI this morning Steven informed me with some great news - I wouldn't be teaching the kids that morning.  Instead, I'd be joining all the kindergarten students in a picnic at Incheon Grand Park!  COOL!  Steven had to stay behind to get work done, so myself, Laura (one of the Korean kindergarten teachers) and Susan hopped in the REI van, along with our 10 kindies (a few were missing today) and it was off to the park.  And we could not have picked a nicer day for a picnic!  It was sunny, warm, and the sky was clear and blue.  And the park was stunning!  The leaves are finally coming out on the trees, the flowers are blooming, and the park was filled with beautiful cherry blossom trees in full splendour!  I wish I had my camera!!!  Incheon Grand Park deserves its name because it's ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE!!!  Apparently every single other kindergarten school in the province had the same idea as we did because the park was FULL of literally DOZENS of other schools!  Was this pure coincidence or was today 'Take Your Kindergarten Kids To Incheon Grand Park Day?'  I have no idea...  It was really crowded and we had difficulty finding a spot of our own in the grassy fields.  It was really cool though to see all the other schools with all the kids decked out in their school colours - little armies of kids all marching together hand-in-hand!  There was a small children's zoo in the park so we took all the kids there and they loved it!  There were goats and sheep and monkeys and geese and domestic dogs (???) and ostriches in the mini-zoo and the kids were able to pet a few of the animals.  You'd think only having 10 kids would be easy to look after (especially with 3 adults) but it was a challenge to keep track of all 10 of them as they ran around excitedly looking at all the animals.  Every time we reached a new animal exhibit I did a head count and it was a good idea cause at one point I noticed that we only had 9...  I looked around and couldn't find Chris - one of our small and very shy 5 year-old girls.  I looked across the zoo and saw her way at the other end, frantically running around looking for us, but heading in the wrong direction.  I had to go and chase after her (Scotty to the rescue!) and she was SO GLAD to see me when I found her!  After the zoo we enjoyed our picnic lunch and then had some time for 'horse-play' in the grass.  I enjoyed being a human toy for the kids - piggyback, baby-in-my-arms, tag, hide and go seek, who's-covering-my-eyes are just a few of the many games that the kids LOVE to play with me and I must admit that I love play-time as much as they do!  After lunch the photographer lady showed up and it was time for the class photo shoot.  We went over to this really pretty area by all the cherry blossom trees and got a couple class group shots in, then it was time for me to be the Foreign Teacher Star.  I got to sit and have my photo taken with each individual student in these really cutesey poses on this lovely park bench under the trees that I know that their parents are going to *LOVE*.  Hell, I'm gonna love seeing them once they're developed!  My kindergarten kids really are the cutest kids in the entire world!  If I get copies of all these photos from the picnic today I'll get them scanned and pass them along to you.  There's some great shots in there, I know, for sure!  The afternoon was sooo quiet today.  The classes seemed to fly by and then next thing I knew it was time to go home.  I got home and puttered around the house for a while, undecided as to what I should do for dinner and whether or not I should head into the city tonight.  My 'pizza party for one' last Friday wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be, and so I didn't want to spend another night at home just sitting around my apartment.  I went into Seoul and had some dinner and then headed over to my Starbucks (man I'm having Starbucks at least twice a week it seems now!  My ol' Delany's gang would kill me if they knew how much I've been supporting the Evil Green Empire over here in Korea!  That S'bux Mermaid Bitch really has me hooked!)  I sat and read for a while and just enjoyed the busyness (I forget how to spell this word!) and activity of the coffee house, and then it was time to head on home.    No plans as of yet for this weekend, but I'm sure something fun will come up.  If not, I'll just make my own fun plans!  :-)

      So I stayed up way too late last night chatting away on Messenger but it was so worth it!  It seemed like *everybody* was online last night and it was great to catch up with old friends back home.  The highlight of the night was being able to chat for a while with my friend Sharon back in Thunder Bay!  We've been friends since Grade 4 (many lifetimes ago it seems now!) and have stayed in touch over all those years.  I hadn't been able to chat with her since arriving in Korea so it was such an awesome surprise to run into her online. I MISS YOU SHARON!!!  :-)  I slept in pretty late today, and it felt great that I was able to do that on a THURSDAY!  Hooray for holidays! I met up with Kevin again and he showed me a bit around his hometown - Incheon.  Other than my arrival at the airport, and an hour at the Immigration Office about a month or so ago, I haven't seen anything of Incheon.  And I've learned there's a lot more to that city than what I thought!  There's lots of great shopping and some nice parks and because it's on the ocean there's some cool waterfront areas to explore as well.  There's also boats leading to offshore islands!  I'll *definitely* have to devote more time to riding west on the subway to Incheon instead of always heading east into Seoul.  Kevin and I did some shopping and he took me to this really cool department store near his sister's house.  Koreans are all about department stores here!   They love 'em!  I had never been a fan of them myself prior to coming to Korea, but I think I'm being slowly converted!  It's kinda cool being in a store with 10 floors selling everything from clothes to food to household supplies to shoes to music and books.  The ubiquitious underground food courts and grocery stores are always cool to explore as well.  I'm *always* on the hunt for familiar foods that I can't find in my local city.  There's always the hope that I'll find some wonderful long-lost treat from back home that I can add to my dull weekdays' diet.  I made two great discoveries today - multi-grain bread and emmenthal cheese!!!  Mmmm...!!  I've been SO SICK of white bread which is all you find in the bakeries around my house, and cheese is a RARE TREASURE (block cheese, that is) anywhere in Korea.  It was going to cost me 13,000 bloody Won to buy the cheese - I gasped when I saw the price (about $15 CDN for a small block) but god dammit I've been DYING for cheese so I bought it anyways.  Luckily Kevin had some vouchers for this department store that he needed to use up before leaving back to London so he actually paid for most of it.  I'm SO EXCITED to have this cheese and I can't wait for lunch tomorrow!!!  It's funny how much joy one gets out of the simplest discoveries here!!!  :-)  We tried to find me some English magazines, but alas, no luck there!  Korea is full of familiar magazines - Vogue, Cosmo, Newsweek, National Geographic, GQ...all the big popular ones we're used to seeing in North America, but they're all 'Korean editions' so I can look through them, but not read any of the articles.  If any of you kind souls back in Canada (or America!) were to perhaps send me a mag or two from home to read, I'd love you forever and ever!!!  (And hey it's a guaranteed way to get your name into my internationally-read and renowned blog!)    Actually, while we're on the topic, there's a few things that I've been missing from home that I would LOVE to receive in the mail (hint hint Mom and Dad!)  To get anything in the mail is wonderful, but the  perfect care package  would include:  - a GQ and Rolling Stone magazine  - Cadbury mini-eggs (buy the leftovers from Easter now before they're gone!) - black socks (all the socks here are either too small for my feet - size 12 - or are those annoying 'short' socks that people like to wear here) - Clinique Happy For Men shower gel - Kraft Dinner - Campbell's Chunky Chicken Noodle Soup - Lipton Sidekicks Noodles - Garlic Raefello - Uncle Ben's Broccoli & Cheddar Instant Rice - Lipton Iced Tea (blue lid!) and  - Garnier Fructisse Normal Hair Shampoo (Korean shampoo is shitty on my hair!)   There's probably quite a few other things that I'd love to get in a care package (like all the food items I mentioned in my earlier blog entry - Day 18)  Hey man I just like getting mail!  Send me anything and I'm thrilled to bits!  But I thought I'd write this up since a few people have asked for suggestions.  Well here ya go!!!  (Now comes the part where I anxiously await the mail everyday....hoping....waiting...)  hehe!    ;-)

      So I may not get much in the way of vacation here in Korea (only 2 weeks off for my whole year here!) but I think I make up for it with days off because of holidays!  Korea has *a lot* of national holidays, and I get every one off (and yet still get paid for it - yah!!!)  I've had two long weekends so far since I've arrived, and have a whole other line-up of holidays quickly approaching!  For example, I have tomorrow off because it's Election Day!  Kinda strange to have a day off mid-week, but hey it breaks up the week and I do love my time-off so I'm not going to complain!  It's really cool being able to experience holidays that I'm not familiar with, while holidays that I'm used to celebrating go completely unnoticed here.  St. Patrick's Day and Easter were non-events here (surprising with the latter considering the amount of Christians there are in Korea,) yet Arbor Day (Tree Day) and Election Day (where no one actually votes, it's an internal government thing) warrant days off from work!  Next month is full of holidays that are new to me and I'm quite excited about it.  Children's Day, Teacher's Day, and Buddha's Birthday all take place in May, and we get days off for all of them!  Right on!!!  Buddhist holidays here are the legal ones, not the Christian ones, but that's because Korea was traditionally a Buddhist country for centuries.  The government holidays have yet to reflect the change in the spiritual beliefs of Koreans, but they're tradition now so I don't think the Buddhist holidays are going anywhere.  Either way, having random days off here and there sounds great to me!  I'm not gonna complain!  Bring on the holidays!!!  :-)

      Here's Part 2 of those unusual/hilarious/odd/surprising sights that you'll only see here in lovely Korea.  Enjoy!   6) Where in the world are you if you see politicians promoting their campaign for becoming alderman/senator/president by getting all their friends together to hang out on random street corners, stand in front of billboard-sized posters of their faces...and do the macarena....all in the hopes of gaining...voters?  Music blaring, wind blowing through their hair, traffic racing past, and there they are - usually 4 or 5 middle-aged citizens, dancing and shaking their booties for passerby, all so that you'll look their way and think "Wow!  Those people *really* do know how to shake their asses!  I think I'll vote for this politician now!  Who cares that he stands against everything I believe in!  His supporters can do the Hokey Pokey like no one else can!  He's getting my vote, man!"  Only in Korea...  7) Where in the world are you if you're walking to work and pass by a truck waiting at the light transporting chicken breasts to some store or market?  But wait - you think this is a sanitized truck carrying boxes of frozen chicken that have all been carefully freeze-dried and air-sealed in protective plastic and then placed in cardboxes, all being driven around town in a truck that keeps a minimum -15 C temperature in order to prevent E.Coli and other nasty diseases from finding a new home in that chicken, right?  Hahaha...oh you poor naive little thing, you!  This is just some dude's truck, carrying some other dude's chicken - stacks and stacks and stacks...of OPEN UNCOVERED CHICKEN PIECES!  No lid, no ice, no protective tarp even - just a big pile of stacked chicken and the open road...  Mmmm...yummy.....  Only in Korea...  8) Where in the world are you if you're stuck in a traffic jam on the streets...because some old bitty is holding up traffic with her giant-ass cart full of cardboard that she's pulling through the city?  18 miles of gridlock cause Ol' Granny doesn't feel taking her cart o' cardboard treasures onto the sidewalk or a side street.  Nope - she's been collecting icky cardboard all day from streets and yards so she can recycle it and make a few Won and dammit she's tired and cranky!  If she wants to drag that cart down Main Street the whole way home, then hell she's gonna do it!!!  Come to think of it, that 18 miles of gridlock is in HER way!  Watch out!  Only in Korea....  9) Where in the world are you if you're out in the city doing some shopping, and then look across the street to see a HUGE LINE of people waiting outside a department store cause they're giving away free stuff?  You stroll over to check it out, and see that not only does the line stretch down THE ENTIRE CITY BLOCK, but that people near the front of the line have been waiting for over an hour to get their freebee item.  Wow!  It must be something really amazing and awesome and *expensive* to have that many people waiting that long outside in the cold!!!  And then you find out that these people are willingly spending their Saturday afternoon waiting for hours in line cause they're giving out...free bags of popcorn...  What the *#@^....???!!!!  Only in Korea....  10) Where in the world are you if you're walking down the street and then get to an intersection with a red light so you have to wait...  and you keep waiting for that light to turn green... and you still you wait even more....  Seasons come and go, the Himalayas rise and fall, ice ages sweep over the planet and melt again...and yet you're still waiting for that god damn ff......oh finally it changed!  GREEN!  God it takes *FOREVER* for traffic light cycles to go through.  And because of this incredibly long wait, which frustrates even Koreans, you're nearly across the street when all of a sudden you hear a commotion behind you....what's that racing across the crosswalk coming right at you?  Why, it's a Korean Mom and her kids, racing madly to try and desperately make it   before the light changes red again, baby carriage in one hand, box of rotting anemic toxic chicken in the other, giant rack of meat strapped to her back, dodging the Cardboard Cart Lady and almost getting burned by a mini explosion from that old man's pile of burning garbage on the street corner, praying to the high heavens that she'll make it down to the Lotte Department Store, only 27 blocks away, that's giving away free popcorn before it's all gone! Watch out foreign boy!  This woman's on a mission from God and nothing ain't gonna separate her and her hungry kids from that free popcorn so you better get out of her path!!!  RIGHT NOW!!!!  Only in Korea...  :-)

      Here's a list of unusual/hilarious/odd/surprising things that I've seen during my 2 months here.  They're things that I've seen at some point or another that made me stop, chuckle to myself, and think "Only in Korea!"  Enjoy!  1) Where in the world are you if you're strolling through a movie theatre, and are greeted in the lobby by ARMED MILITIA!!!  Yep, Korean soldiers decked out in full camouflage, guns in hand, just chillin' out in the movie theatre.  Who exactly are they protecting us from?  Rogue North Korean spies who are stopping for a quick movie break before returning to their recconnaissance spy missions?  Queue jumpers too anxious to wait any more in line for tickets, that need to be put back in their place?  Patrons who are taking just a few too many napkins from the condiment stand and need a severe attitude adjustment?    Only in Korea...  2) Where in the world are you if you're strolling through a busy market place, and see a guy walking through the crowds with a GIANT EIGHT-FOOT RACK OF MEAT on his back!!!  No wrapping, no cellophane, no bag, just a big hunk of bloody juicy ribs, up and over his head, slapped onto his back.  What the hell do you need that much meat for?  Who are you cooking dinner for tonight?  Afghanistan?  Where does one even go to purchase a hunk of meat that big?  Only in Korea...  3) Where in the world are you if your beautiful perfect sleep is rudely interrupted at an ungodly early hour by propaganda trucks cruising through your local neighbourhood?  Yep, you know the ones - those pick-up trucks with GIANT LOUDSPEAKERS on the roof (the kind that any rock band would sell their own mother for to get a hold of) blasting out messages about how great their fruit or meat or squid or whatever it is that they're selling in the back of the truck.  These propaganda trucks literally cruise up and down every single street in the city, blaring away at a volume that disturbs birds in Japan, hoping for customers to buy their fermented seaweed at 7:22am on a Tuesday.  Only in Korea...  4) Where in the world are you if you're driving down a busy street right in the middle of central Seoul (you know, that megacity of 20 million), surrounded by the hustle and bustle of skyscrapers, subway trains, crowds of shoppers, and 8.2 billion other cars, only to look outside your window and see....some old man burning random piles of garbage in giant flaming heaps...right in the middle of the city.  He's not in a garbage dump, he's not in his yard, he's not in an empty desolate suburban parking lot - he's just hanging out downtown, just chillin' out on the sidewalk all by himself.  And oh yeah, he's burning a pile of stinking shit the size of the SkyDome.  Huge flames and black smoke shooting up into the sky....while passerby walk by oh so casually....  Only in Korea...  5) Where in the world are you if you're on a city bus that suddenly has to break and swerve to avoid an oncoming motorcyclist...who's driving at least 100 km/hour....up the street....in the wrong lanes...against the flow of traffic....inbetween streams of oncoming traffic...  And every time you look to see who it is who's on the bike, it's never who you think - (some Korean punk perhaps? an Asian Hell's Angels? a cop on a bike racing to save a baby trapped in a burning overturned propaganda truck?) Nope - it's some old man...with a young pretty thing sitting behind him, arms wrapped tightly around Gramps, holding on for dear life, laughing and screaming at the top of her lungs....  Only in Korea...

      We all slept in really late today and it felt wonderful!  When Brad and I woke up and went outside the apartment, we discovered a really special surprise waiting for us outside the door.  There, sitting in the hall next to Brad's apartment doorway, were two little baskets of Easter treats left for us!  WOW!!!  Here I am, thousands of kilometres from home, in a country where people don't ever give out Easter candy, and staying at a friend's house out in Seoul suburbia, and somehow the Easter Bunny found me!!!  :-)  AMAZING!  (Maybe Santa will find me this December too!)  Andrea later confessed to being the Easter Bunny, but I was thrilled nonetheless at the surprise!  My little basket was cool cause it contained both Western and Korean treats - chocolates, skittles, mentos, a small toy rocket, and dried roasted butter squid!  (Definitely the first time the Easter Bunny has left me...seafood...in my basket!)  :-)  We were originally supposed to go biking in Seoul today but it was so hot outside and we were all feeling really mellow (ie: lazy) that we instead decided to just hang out in Ilsan.  Brad, Andrea, Steve and I went to the grocery store to buy ourselves all the ingredients for the ultimate picnic lunch, and then headed to the nearby Lake Park.  Lake Park is a huge park right in the middle of the New Town built around one of the largest artificial lakes in all of Asia.  The park has fields and trees and flowers and public art and playgrounds and is just a really perfect place to spend a hot Korean afternoon.  Lake Park, well actually all of Ilsandong, has a very 'SimCity' feel to it - it's a completely planned city that's only about 20 years old.  Before that it was just farmer's fields on the edge of the city - now it's home to tens of thousands of Koreans and has its own subway line leading out to it.  We camped out and chowed down on our decadent lunch - baguettes with havarti cheese and roasted chicken, watermelon, and M&M's!  YUM!  The park was packed with Korean couples and families out enjoying the perfect spring weather - such a beautiful day.  Brad had brought along his frisbee so after lunch we tossed it around for a while, trying very hard not hit passing baby carriages, old ladies, and dozens of small children running left, right and centre!  We almost took out some stray children with a rogue frisbee shot a couple of times, but luckily avoided any direct hits!    After our time in the park we went and got some ice cream from Baskin Robbins (there's one on *every* street corner all across Korea) and then wandered around LaFesta for a while where we ran into Kesley.  LaFesta is a large outdoor mall - it has a very 'Southern California' feel due to its open-airiness and free-flow design.  After the mall we all took a cab back to Brad's for dinner.  Andrea made caesar salad (the first I've had in Korea - god I was missing it!) and then ordered some pizzas.  We pigged out on our awesome dinner and sat and chilled and watched TV together.  It was then sadly after 9pm and time for me to make the great trek back to Shihung City.  I said my goodbyes to the gang and then made the 2-hour trip home on the bus and subway.  It actually went by fairly quickly, all my connections worked out perfectly, I had a seat the whole way home, and best of all had Fleetwood Mac and Boney M to rock out to on my discman.  Most excellent!

      (Try saying that five times fast!)  I woke up today and it was so sunny and SO WARM outside!  It was such a beautiful day I couldn't wait to get outside and be in the sunshine and fresh air.  I wanted to do something 'touristy' in the city, but couldn't find any of my friends who were free, so I thought 'to hell with it!' I'm just gonna go and play tourist all on my own.  I have had several friends rave about this one palace in Seoul that's supposed to be the most spectacular of all the ancient palaces, so I thought today would be a perfect day to go and check it out.  I hopped on the train and made my way into the city.  By the time I got into Seoul and had lunch, and then made my way over to the famous Changdeokgung Palace, it was already 3pm!  Luckily for me there was an English tour of the palace beginning at 3:30pm so it really was perfect timing.  Changdeokgung is the largest and best preserved of all of Seoul's palaces, and has even been deemed with the much-coveted status of being a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Because of how priceless this palace is to Korea, well to all of humanity actually, you are not allowed to wander through it freely like you can at the other palaces.  The *only* way to see Changdeokgung is through an organized tour.    The tour began with the Changing of the Guards ceremony which just happened to be right before our tour, and that was really cool to watch.  The costumes worn by the guards back then are brilliant and ornate, reflecting the wealth, prosperity, and unequalled status of the ancient Korean Royal Family.  The tour was about 90 minutes long and was  absolutely breathtaking .  I can see why this palace is so treasured and beloved.  Even though the many buildings that make up the palace have been burned down at least 4 times over the centuries, they've always been rebuilt and restored exactly to their original splendour.  Wandering through the palace grounds literally feels like you're being transported back in time to a period centuries ago.  Changdeokgung is massive in size, and is especially maginificent because it still has all of its original palace grounds and 'secret gardens', which are at least as big as the actual palace grounds themselves.  The entire site is the size of a small town with its own private forest, and its beauty is  absolutely stunning .  I took tons of pictures but I know that when I see them they just won't do it justice at all.    I would have loved to have been able to just wander and explore through the palace and the gardens on my own for a whole day, but alas, the fear of damage caused by foot traffic or fire is so high that you really are restricted in what you can touch and see.  Most of the buildings you can only look into, (not enter), and most of the forest is off limits to the public.  Even with these limitations, one is still swept off their feet with Changdeokgung.  A flight all the way across the Pacific is truly worth it just to see the magnificence of this place.  I feel so blessed just to have been able to see it with my own eyes.  To think of all the kings and royalty that have lived and died here, all the generations that have come and gone, all the fires and wars and storms that this palace has weathered, all the centuries that have flown by like the wind....and yet it's still here, still almost perfectly intact....it just blows me away.    After the palace tour, I went and strolled through Insadong, then did some shopping at MusicLand.  I bought myself two CD's that I'm very excited to own - Fleetwood Mac's 'Greatest Hits', and Boney M's 'Gold! - 20 Super Hits!'  Two excellent albums indded - gotta love impulse shopping!!!  I wandered down to Kyobo Bookshop and browsed through all the titles there for a while as well.  Such a nice relaxing afternoon!!!    I then went and met Kevin for dinner at 7pm at Jonggak Subway Station.  Kevin is Michael's friend that I met last week and is a really nice Korean guy.  Of all the Koreans I've met here so far, his English probably is the best.  We went and had a really delicious dinner at a Korean restaurant.  The restaurant was in Insadong and was super cool - the area that we ate in had a roof SO LOW that everybody who enters has to crouch down to get to their table - it's probably no higher than 5'8" I'm guessing!  Makes for a really cool cozy atmosphere for sure!  We ordered bibimbap which is my *most favourite* Korean dish by far!!  It's a boiling hot stone bowl full of rice and various steaming veggies (most of which I can't identify but that's okay.)  They then crack open an egg and throw it on top - it's so hot in the bowl that the egg cooks right there on top of your food before your eyes.  You then add some spicy red paste hot sauce, mix it all together, and chow down.  IT'S SO GOOD!!!!  After dinner we went and had some chocolate brownie dessert at Starbucks and just chilled for a while.  It was then getting a bit late and I had a party to head off so I said my goodbyes to Kevin and then hopped on the subway.  Brad's friend Jeremy was having a housewarming party at his new apartment and I was invited along to the party and then to crash at Brad's.  I took the train all the way out to Ilsandong which is the new town that Brad and all of them live in.  (Note the difference between  Insadong  - the historic shopping street in Seoul, and  Ilsandong , the suburban New Town NW of Seoul.)  The party was nice and mellow and sociable - I had met Jeremy and his girlfriend Jill before and they're really friendly people.  All the gang was there - Brad, Andrea, Steve, Amy, Emily, Kelsey, and plus a few new faces too.  It was cool to just to chat with everybody, enjoy a few beers, and enjoy the view of Ilsan from 15 floors up.  About 2 hours later or so Brad, Andrea, Steve and myself left the party and went over to Brad's place.  We rented a movie ('Bruce Almighty' - an okay film) and sat and ate cookies and chocolate-covered strawberries that Brad whipped up for us.  YUMMY!!!!  Steve and Andrea left after the movie and Brad and I stayed up pretty late just chatting about all sorts of things, and then finally went to bed around 4am.  Another wonderful amazing day here in Korea!

      So I think I've made peace with my hair.  I've stopped crying myself to sleep every night, and I think the daily group therapy sessions have been really helpful.  I've made great progress in just 7 days and am only 5 more steps away from being Non-Hair-Traumatized!  Wish me luck with those final 5 steps - I don't wanna fall off the bandwagon again, I've been doing so well this week.  Your support through these tough times really gives me strength and inspires me to be a more resilient man.  Together we can get through these horrible hair lows - we just gotta keep the faith that my hair *is* growing back, and someday, in the not too distant future, we can both look at my hair, and smile once again.  Haha!  Gotta love sarcasm, eh?  But I have come to terms with my hair for real - it's not all that bad I guess.  All of my female students have complimented me on it this week, so if 16 12-year old girls like it, how bad can it be?  ;-)  I was gonna head into the city tonight for some dinner like I usually do at the end of the week, but tonight I just didn't feel like it.  Even though I've stayed home every night this week I just wasn't in the mood for going out anywhere tonight.  So, I decided to stay in and have my own little pizza party!  I ordered a pizza (well, technically Steven ordered it for me cause I don't speak Korean, but whatever) and sat and ate on my bed while watching way too much reality TV.  I ate SO MUCH food though - I feel like I'm going to explode!  Good times!  Lazy nights like this are really nice actually, and everyone deserves a night of gluttony once in a while.  (One of the 7 deadly sins?  Who cares!  It tastes great!  haha!)  So most of the cultural differences between Canadians and Koreans, I find, are either really amusing or interesting or even outright entertaining at times, but there are a few differences that frustrate me.  And one of these is the tendency of Koreans to announce/make/change plans at the LAST MINUTE!  This probably wouldn't annoy a normal, regular, sane person, but I must admit that I'm near obsessive-compulsive when it comes to my day planner.  I'm all about making plans *well* in advance, and love to have an entire week's worth of plans already set out by the time Monday or Tuesday rolls around.  Yes I do love my spontanaeity as well, and I don't plan *every single minute*, but generally I do like to know what I'm going to be doing on what nights.  Mostly it's just cause my weekends are so short and I love 'em so much that I always try to make the most of those short 2 days off.    Well anyways, a prime example of this frustrating Korean habit arose tonight.  I just got off the phone about 15 minutes ago with Hye-Young (you'd remember her as the woman I found in my apartment when I came home on the night of the snowstorm.)  Anyways we had our usual little small talk where I speak and she understands about 22% of what I say, and she says random comments that only make sense in the context of the conversation about 22% of the time.  Well she invited me out with her friends to go out clubbing tonight in this are of town called Hondai, but I politely turned the offer down.  I had already sorta settled in for the night and wasn't in the mood for a night of clubbing.  Besides, even if I had wanted to go, I wouldn't have been able to meet up with them in time!!! The subways stop running around 11:30pm, and it would probably take at least 1.5 - 2 hours to get there on transit.  And that's assuming that I was dressed and groomed up and ready to leave AT THAT INSTANT.  It seems totally illogical to me to phone someone up and invite them out that late, knowing full well exactly where I live and how long it takes to get places in this city!  If she wanted me to come out with her and her friends, why not call me EARLIER tonight or even a day or two in advance?  Well, most likely the plans just sorta 'came together' at the last minute with her and her buddies.  Ahhh well.  I don't mean to sound judgemental - I'm not meaning to criticize her polite offer to invite me out - it's just that the delivery is just not what I'm used to.  It goes against every well-organized, agenda-book-lovin', obsessive-planner gene in my body.    (Better start adjusting Scotty, you're the *weird* one in these parts of the world!  haha!)

      "Hi!  I'm Scott.  I'm 27 years old!"  Is this a false statement?  Not in Korea...  You may be interested to learn that Koreans measure age differently than Westerners.  When a baby is born in Korea, it comes out as one year old.  Unlike in North America where we don't start counting age until the baby has emerged from the womb, Koreans count the 9 months from conception to birth as one year of age.  So right off the bat their babies are one year older than ours.  So where does the second extra year come from?  Although Korea now follows the  Gregorian calendar  like the rest of the world, traditionally it used to be a nation strongly influenced by Buddhist/Confucian-ideologies.  A lot of Asian cultures celebrate the New Year differently than we do, which instead follows a  Lunar calendar , and that is why Asian New Year is celebrated in February (and occasionally late January.)  Koreans believe that when a baby experiences its first New Year's, it also gains another year then.  After that they measure age the same way that we do.  So in other words, two babies could be born, one in Canada, one in Korea, both in December, but just two months later the Korean baby would be considered to be two years old, while the Canadian baby wouldn't have even reached one year yet.    Fascinating!  So, technically, since I am living in Korea, I am considered by many of my colleagues to be 27 years old.  And that means this August I'll be turning...28!!??  Wow!  Where did all those years go!  How come I have no recollection of my 26th or 27th birthday?  Was I that drunk?  How long was I passed out for?   Haha!!  It's an interesting cultural difference, for sure!

      Writing.  Why do I write?  Why does it mean so much to me?  Why do I feel so compelled, as much now as when I was a child and a teenager, to write down my thoughts?  Why do I spend so much time every day in keeping up this blog?  To what purpose does it serve?  What is it about writing that makes me feel so...alive, so human?  The answer to all those questions comes down to one thing - connectivity.  For as long as I can remember, ever since I was old enough to hold a pen in my hand, I have felt a love towards writing.  I remember being placed in the Young Authors Club when I was in elementary school which was a club for kids who enjoyed writing so much that they took on extra work and assignments so that they could do even more.  I wrote my own birthday/Mother's Day/Father's Day cards for all my family during my entire childhood with poems that always seemed to make them cry.  I wrote speeches for public speaking contests - placing second and third place in two different years at Sherbrooke.  I wrote dozens upon dozens of letters to penpals all around the world during my teen years. At one point I even had over 20 penpals!  I wrote poetry and short stories all throughout high school and beyond, and have saved much of it over the years.  I wrote occasional editorial pieces and opinion articles for SFU's student newspaper.  I've written speeches for all sorts of important events - an 'Ode To My Parents' for their 25th wedding anniversary, a eulogy for my grandpa's funeral, a best man's congratulatory wishes at my best friend's wedding.  I've kept a diary for the last two and a half years leading up to Korea, and now, I have this - my daily blog.    And again, what do they all have in common?  What was the single reason why I feel such a  yearning  to write all my thoughts down on paper, many of them personal and private, and share with others?  Why does all of this writing release feel like it nourishes my soul?     Connectivity .  For all of my life I have felt such an insatiable need, a desire, a yearning, a lust, an emotion, a passion, a love, for communicating and connecting with other people.  It makes me feel alive.  It allows me to show the people in my life how much they mean to me.  It makes me feel like I matter to others.  To reach out to others, and to be able to evoke a response or an emotion, is one of the simplest yet most beautiful things of all that is to be human.  To write is my way of reaching out.  I may not be the world's best writer, but as long as I am alive, then in some form or another I will never stop writing.  The form and delivery may change over the years, but the outlet will always exist.  Some pieces of writing are meant to be shared with only one person, and some with many, but they all serve the same purpose, they all accomplish the same mission, they all result in the same feeling of....peace.    I can't imagine my life without writing.  I wouldn't know how to live if I couldn't.  Writing is how I relate to the world, how I process my emotions and feelings, how I get over hardship and pain, how I express love, how I reach out to...whoever is listening...  To feel connected to others is the ultimate high, and it's a drug that I just can't get enough of.  I'm addicted, through and through, and just can't ever seem to get enough.  It's not a matter of never being satisfied, it's a matter of knowing that there's no limits to how connected I can feel with those in my life.    Thank you for reading my blog.  Whether it's one person or a million who's reading this, it means more to me than you'll ever know.  This blog also serves as a way for me to keep 'historical records' of all my experiences here in Korea, something that I know I'll truly cherish for years to come in the future.  But, more importantly (at least in the present time) it's my way of communicating with all the wonderful friends and family that I have scattered around this world.  I may be thousands of kilometres from you in physical space, but writing this helps me feel like you're right here with me.  Thanks for being on the receiving end.  Let's keep the high going.  (I don't ever wanna come down.)    :-)

      So I *finally* got paid in full today!  I applied a bit of pressure to my boss this morning, politely reminding him, yet again, that I still hadn't been paid in full for my first month of work.  I've been pretty damn patient so far, but I'm approaching payday for Month #2 and I was still waiting for the rest of my money from Month #1?  Yeah, no...I'm not down with that.  Anyways the money materialized in the afternoon, and I was really pleased to finally have that taken care of.    However, the payback shoe did drop.  I didn't get quite as much as I thought I was going to earn, but this time it was due to my own miscalculation.  TAXES!  Oh yeah, I forgot about those!  Korean taxation laws, atleast for the income bracket I'm in, is at 7%.  This is *much lower* than what I'd be paying in taxes for that same amount of income back in Canada, but it still sucked to have to pay up!  I'm really confused though with how taxation works with me back in Canada....  Will I have to pay even more taxes in a year from now to Canada when I do my income taxes for 2004?  Or am I excused because my earnings were in another country, and I already paid the appropriate amount of taxes for that particular country?  I'm really not sure about this.  It would make sense to me to ONLY pay Korean taxes since, with the exception of my final month at Delany's in January, all of my 2004 earnings will have been made OUTSIDE of Canda...but knowing the Canadian government they'll find some way to milk more money out of me in a year, I'm sure.  Greedy bastards!  It would really really suck to be dinged twice for taxes....  New topic - something more pleasant, please!  Let's talk about fatherhood.  I feel almost embarrassed saying this, because it's so 'not me', but for the first time in my life, I'm really feeling strong urges to have children of my own.  And I know that I can blame it all on this job!  I had always sorta considered having kids one day - like way in the future after a career had been worked out first, but it wasn't something that I had really thought about too much.  Now, being surrounded by all these kids, of various ages, I can honestly say that I would really love to have children of my own one day.  Some of my kids are so absolutely adorable, I just want to take them home with me (I don't think the parents would like this too much though!)  There's this one kid in particular who I totally love - his name's Fred and he's one of my really young 5-year olds.  He's the sweetest little thing and he's sooo cute - he's the only student in the school with curly hair (all the other kids have poker straight black hair) and he has these bright shiny eyes and a laugh that could light up a room.  All of my kids have a special place in my heart, but Fred is definitely one of my favourites.  I have to say that it feels really, really good to walk in to class everyday and have tons of kids run up and give me a giant hug.  Most days I have to pry them off cause they just don't wanna let go.  These children give out love so willingly and so unconditionally - I've only been in their lives for two months and it's like they can't wait to see me everyday.  They seem so genuinely happy to see me and I love the love they give out.  It really is a beautiful and inspiring thing.  Now, realistically, I know that I'm a bit spoiled with these kids.  I only spend part of the day with them, and so when they're bad or misbehaving I know that once the bell rings and it's the end of the day I don't have to deal with them anymore.  They go home to their parents who are the ones who are truly raising them.  I get to spend a lot of time with them, but I mostly only see their good sides and get to deal with all the fun stuff (most of the time.)  Still, even though it's only been 2 months I've seen so much progress and growth in some of my kids already that it really blows me away.  I can't even imagine how much they're gonna grow up and change by the time my year here is up.  I really will be sad when it's time to leave these kids.  Personally, I think I'd make a great dad.  I'm patient, loving, and really feel like a big kid at heart.  I play with my kids when none of the other teachers will, and am not afraid to be really silly or look dumb or just 'put myself out there' to get a smile from them.  To know what it would feel like to raise a son or daughter, from the day they're born to when they're wee little children to when they're teenagers to when they're adults of their own....must be the most amazing, rewarding feeling a human could ever experience.  Now I'm in no rush to go off and get me some babies, there's plenty of other things in life I want to experience first.  I have to complete The World Tour, which will last several years, and then I want to go back to Canada and do my Masters, and then at least have a real, solid career beginning...  So it's probably a good decade or so before I would ever have children, but there's a small part of me inside now that can't wait for that day.  For the day when I get to be the dad who's waiting for his little boy or girl to come home from a day at school, run into my arms, and tell me how much they love me, and know that this child's life is more important to me than anything else in the world.  To have children must be to know what true unconditional love really is.  Parents are so lucky!

      *Beep-beep!  Beep-beep!  Beep-Beep!*  My alarm screamed in my ear...ugh....was it 5:45am already?  Time to get up....  You may be wondering why I was getting up so goddamn early this Monday, even though it was a day off from work?  (Today was Arbor Day - a National Holiday in Korea - yah!)  Well me and the whole Park family were going out to Everland today - Seoul's version of a Disneyland-like amusement park.  Long weekends in Korea are notorious for producing horrific traffic jams on the freeways heading out of the city so Steven wanted to beat the crowds by getting up REALLY early so that we could be first in line to get into Everland.  We picked up Steven's sister, her husband, and their two children (the same people I went and saw at church last weekend.)  We all rode together in Steven's mini REI bus and hit the highway out to Everland.  Everland is located outside of Seoul, down to the south.  It was about an hour or so on the highway from Shihung to Everland and being that it was so early I slept most of the way.  I woke up just as we were approaching the park and it was really cool to see the arrival.  Everland is nestled in this horseshoe-shaped valley in the hills south of Seoul and it really is a very serene location for an amusement park like this.  When I got there I was surprised to see that were ALREADY LINE-UPS of people waiting to get into the park!  Wow!  It wasn't even 9am yet...  Just how busy was this park gonna get today?  Steven's sister and her family were extremely nice and paid for my admission into the park.  Everland is very, very similar to Disneyland (I've only been to the one in Anaheim) and I wouldn't be surprised if it was modelled directly after the California landmark.  You pay one price that basically gets you in and allows you to ride anything you want in any order, as many times as you like.  When you first walk in through the big gates you're in this 'town square.'  Unlike Disneyland though, this town square was made up of various architectural styles from around the world - Victorian, Buddhist-temple style, Midevil castles, and even a giant mosque (all holding restaurants and gift shops.)    Everland is very large and contains many rides ranging in size and scariness-level.  The first ride we went on turned out to be my favourite!  It was this absolutely incredible rollercoaster called American Adventure and is the most fun I've ever had on a ride!  It's a  suspended rollercoaster  (which I had never been on before) in which the 'buckets' you ride in are free to swing from side to side as you rocket along.  The coaster is located entirely in a forest along the edge of Everland, and it begins with dragging you 1000 feet up the sides of the hills before launching you down into the trees!  IT WAS SO FAST!!!  You literally whipped along from corner to corner and at times I swear we were completely turned at a 90-degree angle!!!  It literally felt like you were  flying through the forest  and it was amazing!!!  Wow!!  I could've ridden that coaster all day long and not gotten tired of it!  We spent the first part of the day just wandering from ride to ride.  Considering that I tend to have a weak stomach towards rides, I must say that I fared really well today and never got sick or too dizzy!  Again, in Disney-esque style, we saw this ride called Global Village that we went on.  It's this cheesy ride where you sit in a boat and float through all these different 'countries' where dolls dressed up dance and move for you (can we say "It's A Small World After All!!!")  Everland also has lots of really beautiful flower gardens and because it was spring they were having their Tulip Festival throughout the park - really pretty! We got to see their Euro-Carnival which was a circus-like performance involving acrobats and gymnasts - really neat to watch.  After that we had lunch and then wandered more throughout the sprawling park.  At this point it had gotten ABSOLUTELY PACKED in Everland!  It was so crowded and I swear it seemed like all of Seoul had decided to come to the park for the day!  The line-ups for rides were getting ridiculously long - after a certain point there wasn't a single ride where line-ups were under an hour, and some even stretched to two hours!!!  HOLY SHIT!  We just went on only one more ride in the afternoon, and I think we made a good choice.  We went on the Amazon Express which is a tube ride down this 'whitewater river' in the jungle - tons of fun and we all got splashed quite a lot!  (Very refreshing on this warm day!)  After this ride we went and caught the Magic Parade - a good-sized parade full of giant floats and lots of dancers.  We then wandered through the Equatorial Zone - full of tigers, lions, chimps and monkeys, seals, polar bears, and of course the omnipresent petting zoo.  This park really does have everything!  What was really great about today was how absolutely spoiled I was by Steven's sister and her husband!  Not only did they pay for my admission, but they bought me lunch, cotton candy, a churro, a snowcone, and even some souvenirs!!!  They are so nice to me!!!  They really made me feel like I was 'part of the family' and it was great fun to hang out with them and their kids.  Today again reinforced to me how lucky I am to have ended up with such a friendly 'host family' to take care of me!!!  I totally felt like a kid again today with all the rides, the candy, and just the plain good ol' fashioned innocent fun that one feels in an amusement park.  By the time 4pm came 'round we were all getting pretty tired, and plus with all the crowds and the line-ups it was becoming a bit much to stay in the park any longer.  We said our goodbyes to Everland and drove back to Shihung City.  Again, I slept all the way home!  Everland was a total blast and I'd love to go back there sometime, maybe with some of my friends on a non-holiday day (hopefully less busy that way!) so that I can ride that awesome rollercoaster again!  Woohoo!!!!!!

      Today was a really relaxing, leisurely day.  I slept in fairly late at Michael's, woke up before the rest, and got showered up.  Michael and Kevin began stirring later, and then Michael made us a yummy breakfast of frozen waffles (very hard to find in Korea!) and strawberries - so tasty!  We all sat and chilled for a while and then I had to head out cause I was meeting up with my friend James.  Now I had never actually met James until today.  James is friends with my friend Joanne back in Vancouver.  When Joanne heard that I was moving to Seoul she gave James my email address so that I'd know a friendly face here in Korea.  James and I have chatted a few times on the phone, and have tried to meet up to hang out before, but our schedules just always seemed to conflict.  Today we finally got to meet and he's a super nice guy!  He's a Korean guy who spent a year in Vancouver (where he met Joanne) and plans on moving back to Vancouver after he finishes university here.  He was really friendly and polite and went out of his way to make sure that I feel welcome here in Korea.  We took a cab over to Jongak - an area I've explored several times myself but never get tired of visiting (it's where MusicLand, Chongo Tower, and my Starbucks is.)  We went to a Korean restaurant to have some lunch and it was cool just to sit, eat, and chat over a couple of beers.  He talked a lot about how badly he wants to become Canadian, and how much he loved it there, and it made me feel really lucky that I am already.  So many people around the world dream of being able to live in Canada, and I was blessed enough to be born there!  I never had to 'earn' my way in - I was just automatically part of the country the instant I came into this world - how fortunate for me!!!  After lunch we walked on over to nearby Insadong to browse around.  I've been to Insadong before too - with Steve - a few weeks ago.  Insadong is the street full of stores that sell traditional Korean crafts, and there's lots of really neat art galleries there as well.  Insadong is a hugely popular neighbourhood in Seoul, both with tourists and with locals alike.  On Sundays it's pedestrian-only which is a real treat - I wish more streets were like that in Seoul!  Insadong really is one of the coolest parts of the city and is a must-see for everyone who comes to visit here.  We got to Insadong just in time to see a really amazing street performance!  This group of people were dressed all up in traditional Korean garb and began to re-enact this ritual done in ancient times for the crowd that had gathered.  The ritual involved dragging prisoners in a cage on wheels through the streets of the city, while guards marched and chanted.  The public display of the wrong-doers was a means to visibly demonstrate to civilians the consequences of breaking the laws, and it also caused the prisoners to 'lose face' in public - one of the greatest punishments a Korean could ever experience.  The costumes were really beautiful, and there were several dancers following the 'parade' as well who performed several traditional dances - very graceful and elegant.  Some of the guards even stopped to perform some martial arts and it was great fun to watch the mock fighting!    It was really packed in Insadong with shoppers and viewers of the parade, and I was able to get some great photos of the show.  The weather was absolutely beautiful today as well - a warm breeze and bright blue skies.  Later, after the performance had ended, James and I did some more window-shopping along the street.  I stopped and bought some postcards to send to my friends and family back home.  Before we knew it a few hours had passed and it was approaching evening.  James had to leave to go and work at his mother's restaurant so we said our goodbyes.    Not having anywhere to be at that time, I decided to hang out in the Jongak area a little longer.  I went back to the Starbucks I was at the other night, and sat down with a yummy chai latte and spent an hour and a half writing out all my postcards.  It was really nice to just sit and relax and watch people go by.  After I finished that I grabbed a quick dinner and then took the train back home.   Knowing that I had to get up *really early* the next day I just watched some TV and then went to bed early.

      Yes, there was definitely caffeine in my drink last night!  I tried to go to bed relatively early last night but it just didn't happen.  I lay in bed for what seemed like forever....waiting for the coffee jitters to subside.  As a result, I ended up sleeping in a bit later today than what I had planned.  Oh well!  Time to get my ass in gear....  I had plans to meet up with Michael in the afternoon to go and check out the Cherry Blossom Festival on Yeuoido Island with some of his friends, but first we both needed to get haircuts.  He's been going to this one stylist way over in COEX Mall and reccomended me to her, so I thought I'd give her a shot.  Now I must admit that I was really nervous about this!  Anyone who knows me, knows that I'm really anal-retentive, hell let's just say it, I'm obsessive, about my hair.  I spend way too much time fussing with it everyday, and I'll be the first to admit that I can't pass a mirror without stopping to adjust it.  I have, (or should I say had?) a really fantastic stylist back in Vancouver - the dear sweet talented Marnie who took good care of my precious locks.  Well anyways I've left Marnie behind (obviously) and so now, nearly 2 months since I've had my last haircut, I'm in desperate need for one.  I've been putting it off, being just too nervous to go and have some  stranger  take a pair of scissors to my head.  Well time to bite the bullet and be a man about it - go and get your hair cut Scott!!!  I ended up arriving at the salon only minutes before Michael did, so the timing worked out really well.  The salon was way cool - when I arrived they put me in this white robe, gave me something to drink, and told me that I could surf the net while waiting for Jin (the girl Michael reccomended) to finish with her current client.  Well my turn came eventually, and I was a bit nervous to have Jin cut my hair but I talked myself through it (not aloud of course!)    Well a lot of good the pep talk did me, cause she ended up  butchering  my hair!!! I don't know what crack she was smoking before came into work that day, but my hair looks pretty god damn awful.  It's long in places it shouldn't be, too short in others, and I keep finding chunks of LONG LEFTOVER HAIR that she should've cut but seemed to have forgotten.  Now without sounding over-dramatic ('Too late Scott!' you say?) I must say that although my hair cut is bad, it's not as bad at The Great Hair Butchering of '98 when I had my hair *destroyed* by fuckin' Great Clips (never, EVER go there!) just before my Uncle Paul's wedding.  I'm gonna give it a few days and maybe I can try and find...new ways to style it?  Well what other choice do I have!  haha!  They always say that misery loves company, and although I didn't wish this upon him, Jin ended up butchering Michael's hair too!  We both left the salon, severely disheveled, disgraced and disappointed.  We met up with Michael's friends Kevin and Eric, who were two really nice Korean guys.  We took the subway over to Yeuoido Island to meet Michael's other friends Lisa and Sarah, two very outgoing girls from New Zealand.    We made a b-line to Cherry Blossom Park, but were a bit disappointed when we arrived.  There were blossoms....but there was only one street-lined row and that was about it...  I don't know what we were expecting (massive fields exploding with cherry blossoms where we would all hold hands and run and frolic together in slow-motion, music queued up in the background like some Gap commercial?) but it wasn't this.  We just made a laugh of it anyways, took some pics, and walked around for a bit around the island.  After that the girls split, and so us 4 guys went and got Michael's car and then drove to a really cool neighbourhood of Seoul called Apgujeong.  Apgujeong is Seoul's yuppie/uber-trendy neighbourhood - think of it as Yaletown on Asian steroids.  Blocks and blocks of high-end shopping, designer boutiques, giant expensive department stores, trendy little restaurants, and nightclubs that are the kind of place to see and be seen.  Michael wanted to go to his gym for a bit, so he took off for a bit while the three of us wandered around.  Michael rejoined us later and we all had a delicious dinner at this really cool Korean restaurant - very trendy, but still quite affordable.    After dinner we went back to Michael's apartment in Itaewon to sit and chill a bit with some good tunes and a bottle of Merlot.  We killed a few hours just chatting and being silly, and then next thing we knew it was 11pm.  Michael had to go and pick up a friend who lives in Bundang - an area of town even more lost in suburbia than where I live.  We picked up his friend Austin and then headed back to 'the hill' (the collection of nightclubs in Itaewon we hang out at, and also just half a block from Michael's apartment.)  I wasn't planning on staying out all that late, as I'm still trying to get over my cold, and didn't want to feel like shit on Sunday either.    Well that plan got thrown out the window rather quickly!  I ended up having a few drinks here and there, and had my best night of clubbing yet in Korea!  I got this second wind from god knows where, and basically just *danced my ass off* all night long.  The last couple times I've gone out I've started to fade or just downright crash around 2 or 3pm, but this night I just kept on going - just like the Energizer Bunny.  What was really awesome about this night was how it seemed that all my friends seemed to all be out- Gavin, Ryan, James....everyone was out and about!  The music was really good tonight, and I was just in a really really good mood!  I remember at one point, dancing in a group of my friends, as well as with a few new people I had met that night, and looked around in amazement.  There, dancing in one group together, was a Canadian (me), an American, an American-Korean who now lives in England, a Korean, a German, and a Colombian!  It was like The United Nations Dance Fest 2004 or something!  A nightclub version of a United Colors of Benetton poster ad!  WOW!  Now if only real life international relations was as easy and care-free as a group of 6 people from all different backgrounds and nationalities dancing the night away at a club!   Next thing I knew it was almost 4am and all my buddies were fading fast, so we said our goodbyes and then Kevin, Michael and I went and crashed at Michael's place.  (Is it just me or am I *really lucky* with seeming to have picked friends who all happen to have nearby apartments that I can crash at!??  haha!)

      Today was a surprisingly energetic and *fun* afternoon!  I'm feeling much better today and my energy/enthusiasm level was 10-fold what it was yesterday.  My voice is still coming and going, and cracks occasionally, making it sound like I'm just entering puberty - all of this is much to the delight of my students who giggle every time I open my mouth!  Anyways, this afternoon it was back to reciting the boring dialogue that we've been doing for the last few days, but something strange and wonderful happened today...  To practice the dialogue, we've been doing a bit of 'role-playing' in class where me and a student sit up at the very front at a small desk and pretend to be having a conversation, based on the dialogue we've been rehearsing endlessly.  This has been quite boring...until today.    While sitting up front with one of my students, engaged in the dialogue, one of my students suddenly jumped up from his seat, came up to the front and started to pretend that he was 'filming' us, using a cookie-tin lid as a mock camera.  And then another student caught on to his game, and grabbed a textbook, sat it on his shoulder, and pretended that it was a video camera, and circled around us over and over, as if he was a part of a camera crew.  And then a third student grabbed a really long ruler and stood and held it over us, pretending that it was our 'mic' - instantly we had a 'TV studio'!  The energy level of the class went from being on life-support to total ecstacy in about 15 seconds.  Suddenly the whole class COULDN'T WAIT for it to be their turn to be a 'TV star' and engage in the dialogue!  A few of the girls in the class even pretended to be teenage fans of me, and asked for 'autographs.'  It was absolutely hilarious, and I was having such a blast!    This random, sudden spark of creativity from the students blew me away.  A routine and dull exercise was suddenly transformed into a fun, entertaining learning game that *everyone* eagerly wanted to participate in.  And I couldn't take any of the credit for it.  It was all the students, who just grabbed the idea and ran with it, completely unprompted and undirected.  For a moment I felt like I was the student, and it was them who were leading me in the classroom.  I can't remember the last time our class had so much fun!  And this was the same exercise that we had all been falling asleep with the day before.  Wow what a difference a little creativity makes!!!  It was completely inspiring.  After work today I decided to treat myself and head into the city for some dinner.  I've been a bit of a hermit all week long with my cold and all, and decided that some time out of the house tonight would be a good thing.  I took a train down to the area near where Chongo Tower and MusicLand is, had some dinner, and then went to the Starbucks just around the corner.  This was my first visit to a Starbucks since arriving in Korea, and I was shocked at how it was *EXACTLY* the same as the ones back home.    Now I've been in plenty of Western chains since arriving in Seoul, and they are all basically the same as the versions back home, but yet all have *slight* differences that just make it a little bit 'Korean'.  McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut, etc. are all examples of chains here that I've seen that have slight differences from the ones back home, either in menu items, names of products, or even just fonts and colours used in the store.  And then when you eat the food, it tastes *almost* the same, but not quite....  But this Starbucks...it was like I had somehow instantly beamed myself to Robson and Thurlow back home.  Everything was absolutely identical, and I was even able to order everything in English without any difficulty at all.  My caramel macchiatto was delicious, as if it has been cloned from one in North America.  The chairs, the furnishings, the decor and store colours, the music, the menu boards, everything was exactly the same - the only difference was the addition of Korean text next to English.  Otherwise I could have been in Vancouver, and with all the Asians it didn't feel any different from back home at all!  I sat for almost 2 hours and read my book, and every time I looked up, I had to keep reminding myself that I was smack dab in the middle of giant Seoul, in faraway Asia.  It was almost creepy!    I ordered a decaf drink but I don't think it was made that way because I've been absolutely *wired* since Starbucks.  I jittered all the way home on the train, and couldn't sit still on the bus.  I love the music they play on the busses here in Korea.  It's always the most random unexpected mix that you can't even imagine and it's always really fun music.  I boarded the bus and was greeted by Boney M, of all bands!  And they actually play the music fairly loudly on the bus - it's not just background music!  Following Boney M, I was seranded by 'Hey Mickey' (but the cheesed-up remix from the movie Bring It On), some Korean cover of a Barry Manilow song, Eagle-Eye Cherry's 'Save Tonight', 'Kiss Me' by Sixpence None The Richer, and then Elton John's 'Believe'.  SO MUCH FUN!  :-)    Let's just hope now that I can sleep tonight!

      Today was such a boring day!!!    Our elementary classes were all given a dialogue to memorize for class, and so we've been practicing it all class long for the last few days.  It's a mock dialogue/conversation on eating and it's not so much the material that is boring, but the fact that we've been doing it over and over and over...  I sit and recite the same words endlessly, while the kids recite the same responses back to me.  It's completely dry and uninspiring but hey repitition is part of learning a new language and if this is what Steven wants us to do, then I gotta go along with it.    BUT IT'S JUST SO FUCKING BORING!!    Seriously, there was one point in class today that I thought I was gonna lose it.  I have to recite this dialogue probably *at least* 15-20 times in each class, so you multiple this by 3 classes, multipled by 2 days, (and counting...) and that's A LOT OF REPETITION!!!  I try really REALLY hard not to keep looking at the clock, cause everytime I do I swear it's moved backwards....  It's like being in a time warp or something...classes today went by soooooo sloooooowly.  I know I'm sounding over-dramatic, but I guess I just didn't have the patience for it today.  And to make matters worse, just when I thought I was getting over my cold, I've started to lose my voice in the last few days.  Yesterday, and especially today, my voice has been 'coming and going', cracking, groaning, and I just haven't been up to full vocal capacity.  And in a job like this, you really need to have a good, strong, clear voice 100% of the time!  This did not add to the 'fun and joy' of repeating that god-damned dialogue a million times over.  But hey no one said that being an English Teacher was gonna be fun and games every single day.  Today wasn't a bad day, just a really, really boring one!  Death to monotony!

      Today was Henry's last day in town, as he was flying back home to Vancouver that evening.  We slowly rolled out of bed - a little tired, a little parched - and headed back out into the city.  We finally went and visited Seoul Tower perched atop Namsan Mountain, but it wasn't the best day for it.  It wasn't raining, but it was really humid and SO SMOGGY today!!  You could hardly see anything for all the grey-brown smog that was drowning the sticky metropolis in a death-grip choke-hold!  But it was his last day and so we figured better a partial view of Seoul from above than no view at all!  After spending some time atop Seoul Tower having lunch and taking in the polluted view we decided to do some more shopping in Itaewon.  No, let me rephrase that, *HENRY* decided that we needed to do some more shopping in Itaewon.  OMG can that boy shop!!  I've never met anyone who can shop and shop and shop and still be itching to shop some more after all that.  We've done virtually nothing but shopping in the last 72 hours and as much of a blast as its been I had personally had enough of it!  But, Henry's the guest, so I went along with it like a good host and tour guide would.  So we checked out all the street stalls of Itaewon and with even less than an hour left before departure time, Henry was still feverishly shopping with enough zest and passion to put Paris Hilton's consumption habits to shame!  But to give Henry credit he's a *damn good* shopper - he can bargain like it's no one else's business and always manages to get these crazy discounts that no one else can!  To watch him shop is to watch a master at work.  He's had 32 years of practice and has made shopping a true art form.  I bow down to Henry's shopping superiority.  It was then time to pack up all our bags and check out of Seoul Motel.  I walked Henry to the bus stop for the airport shuttle and then said my goodbyes to my dear friend.  He's one of my bestest buds in the whole world and we always have a blast together.  Henry's one of the very few friends that I have that I can travel with extensively (ie: longer than a day trip) and not get tired or bored of his company.  It was sad to see him but he says he's planning a second visit to Seoul in December, to do some more shopping, of course!  LOL!    I journeyed back to Shihung and was EXHAUSTED when I got home.  My weekend with Henry was only a few days but felt like much longer.  We saw and experienced in 3 days what most people would do in a week!  WHEW!!!  But it was a great time from beginning to end.  It even felt like I was on vacation myself, with all the touring and the time spent out on the town and in the motel.  I don't imagine any of my other friends back home will ever be able to afford to come visit me (airfare to Seoul is not cheap) which is too bad cause there's so much cool stuff to see here.  And I love being the tour guide to show it off!  So accept this as an open invitation to come visit me here in Korea - please - I'd love to see you!!!  :-)

      Today was a crazy-busy but wonderfully-packed day full of all the best that Seoul has to offer.  A whirlwind day from beginning to end - Henry and I played tourist like there was no tomorrow.  We covered the city from top to bottom - we really did pack it all in in just 24 hours - palaces and shopping and night markets and history and Korean cuisine and culture and dancing and debauchery.  *Whew!*  Korea's capital will never be the same again!  And all of this was done with a late start!  We didn't get out of bed until 11am (had to sleep in a bit cause of our late night out last night!) and grabbed a quick lunch at Subway before launching full force into Tourist Mode.  We made a b-line for Gyeongbokgung - Henry taking no less than approximately 254 photographs, I believe, from the cab as we drove through the city on the way to the glorious palace grounds.  This was my third visit to Gyeongbokgung - known as the Palace of Shining Happiness - and I still find it awe-inspiring each and every time.  It never loses its ancient lustre or magnetic appeal - I love this place.    It was hot and humid again but at least there was no rain!  We made our way through the palace grounds, Henry photodocumenting every nook and cranny of the place, and then we walked on over to the National Museum.  The National Museum is the largest of Korea's museums and is a great place to spend an afternoon - not only is it filled with thousands of incredible artifacts from thousands of years of civilization on the Korean peninsula but it is a cool and comfortable escape from the city's heat and smog!  Thank God for air conditioning is all I can say!  Normally how I prefer to tackle a large museum like this is to dedicate a whole day, or at least several hours of an afternoon, to wander through the entire collection, browsing every piece and exhibit.  Well we didn't have time for this in today's schedule!  In less than one hour we wizzed through no less than 32,000 years of Korean history in a flash - wow, time travel can be exhausting at this pace!  It was time for a Starbucks break after the museum - the energy level had dipped dangerously low below 'fabulously over-zealous' and we really needed the caffeine boost! After refuelling it was back on the tour - next stop Changdeokgung Palace!  This is the palace that I visited on my own a few months ago - the UNESCO World Heritage Site that requires one to join an organized tour in order to enter the grounds.  Henry and I arrived just in time for the 3:30pm tour and we spent the next 90 minutes soaking up the splendour that is Changdeokgung.    It's hard for me to decide which of the two palaces we saw today I like best.  They're both several hundred years old and very beautiful, yet quite different at the same time.  I like Gyeongbokgung because it's absolutely massive and sprawling and it feels like I'm in a city-within-a-city.  And you can stand inside the main inner stone courtyard, look north and see the ginormous palace reception hall surrounded by stone walls, colourful wooden peaked rooves, and Buddhist statues guarding over the sacred building.  And then you can turn your head south and look out over the courtyard and see dozens of soaring modern skyscrapers topped by flashing digital billboards rising up behind the burly gate that guards the entrance - a magnificently alluring juxtaposition of the ancient with the futuristic.  At Changdeokgung, however, I really feel like I can disappear from the chaos of Seoul and just lose myself in the palace grounds.  I can hide among the pavillions and ponds in the once exclusive royal family's private gardens and almost imagine that I've been transported back through time to the Joseong Dynasty.  All that surrounds you are the quietness of the ancient architecture and the serenity of the private forest.  Huge orange Japanese coy swim in the pond, birds are chirping, and a cool breeze whispers through the boreals.  Escapism at its best.  After Changdeokgung we cruised through Insadong, exploring the arts and crafts shops, and then having some delicious bibimbap for dinner.  Then it was time to head over to Namdaemun Market where we spent a good two hours plus exploring the never-ending market.  Namdaemun is one of the largest outdoor markets in Seoul, comprised of several streets and alleyways, filled with thousands upon thousands of stands selling everything from shoes to lingerie to ginseng candy to leather jackets to squid to knockoff designer purses to sea urchents to twelve billion t-shirts.  So cool!  We both did some shopping - Namdaeum is a bargain-hunter's paradise - and stayed until it started to close down around 9pm or so.    It was then time to head back to Itaewon to get all gussied up for our big bad night out on the town.  We decided to 'go glam' and really dress up tonight - dress pants and funky shirts and shiny shoes and modelesque hair! (yes we're modest boys!)  We made our appearance back at the lounges on 'the hill' and met up with my friends Austin & Eric.  We had an absolutely amazing night - we were introduced to lots of new people, had too many drinks, and danced the night away until 3am.  We then left the club scene to repeat last night's late-night snack bar gig.  We found another streetside Korean 'greasy-spoon' grill and ordered up a big buffet of deep fried treats.  YUM!!! After socializing and snacking it was time for bed.  Another late arrival at the motel - just after 4am tonight when we pulled in.    What a great day!!!  It truly was a whirlwind tour of Seoul!  My head was still spinning as I laid down to sleep.  Blissful dizziness...

      Henry and I were up bright and early this morning at 7am so that we could head out and do some touristy things before I had to go to work in the afternoon.  We woke up and were disappointed to see that it was still raining cats and dogs outside.  I had planned on taking Henry up Namsan to Seoul Tower to get a great introductory view of the city, but there was no point taking him up to the Tower if all we were gonna see were clouds and grey!  Besides the rain, the humidity was DISGUSTINGLY high today!  It was somewhere in the mid-to-upper 90-percentile range and it made for sweaty, wet times - even without the torrential downpours!  Not a good day to be outside!  Time for Plan B.    We decided to go and check out Yongsan Electronics Market instead.  YEM is the largest electronics market in all of Asia, consisting of over 5000 stores spread throughout 12 or so buildings.  YEM sells absolutely everything that's electric - from computers to washing machines to blenders to stereos to TV's to microwaves to telephones to MP3 players to electric badets (wow - I didn't know they existed!)  Basically, if you can plug it in, it can be bought here at YEM.  It was my first time here and it was mind-boggling, all the selection!  Henry practically has an obsession with anything electronic and is always into the latest gadgets and toys and high-tech shit that 'just came out.'  I knew he was going to LOVE YEM - and man he went nuts!  He was like a kid in an electronic candy store - pure heaven for a self-professed gizmo guru like himself! He wanted to buy a new laptop (he broke his current one on the way to the airport to come to Asia) and there were hundreds and hundreds for him to choose from.  Crazy!  I had to head off to work so I left him behind and took the train to work.  It was a really mellow day at work and before I knew it I was back on the subway to Itaewon to meet Henry for dinner.  When I got back to the motel he was grinning from ear to ear - there on the bed was a bright, shiny brand spanking new Japanese laptop - a fancy-schmancy SOTEC that Henry bought for less than half than what he would have paid for it back in Canada.  "I love Korea!!!" he exclaimed...I knew that taking him to Yongsan Electonics Market would be all that it would take!  Ha ha!    We caught a cab over to the Jonggak area and Henry was in awe over all the streets full of neon, covering storefronts from street to rooftop.  We went and had a delicious dinner of dakkalbi (sorta like a grilled spicy chicken stirfry dish) and then headed back to the streets.  We were gonna go and see a movie but all the ones we wanted to see hadn't opened yet in Korea (I'm *DYING* to see The Day After Tomorrow!)  Luckily for us the rains had stopped so we just walked around taking in all the sights.  We did some shopping and then headed back to motel in Itaewon.    We got all cleaned up and then headed out for a night out on the town in Itaewon.  We went and had some drinks at a lounge on 'the hill' and ran into my friend Gavin and his roomie Ryan who I hadn't seen in months.  We all sat and chilled and chatted, and then later Henry and I headed out to some nearby clubs.  It was a fun night but kinda disappointing in the clubs - they were less-than half empty!  Apparently there was some big clubbing event going on in another part of Seoul and that's where everybody was.  Ahh well - it was still good times!  We headed home around 2am or so but on the way back to the motel stopped at one of the many street stalls for a late-night snack.  Henry was ENTHRALLED with these little mini roadside restaurants and he ordered a plethora of Korean grilled goodies for us to sample - chicken, tofu soup, deep-fried shrimp, tempura, mandu (dumplings) and a bunch of other stuff that I didn't recognize.  So yummy!  Nothing like a belly full of greasy food after a night of drinking!  These two guys sat down next to us at the stand and it turns out they were New Zealand's Trade Commissioners for Korea and Japan, respectively!  They were super cool guys and told us all about their high-profile jobs and their lives they'd spent living abroad.  The four of us just ate and chatted away, while a dozen or so trannies* were running around up and down the alley, cackling away, trying to 'make some new friends' (for an hour or so, for a small fee of course!)  It was one of those wonderfully random 'Wow I'm in Asia having a crazy experience that I never would have back home!' moments - I love those unexpected and prolific waves of awe, englightenment, and the feeling of being so damn lucky!  They make me pause, smile and reflect for a moment before the feeling passes and then I'm back in the current reality.  It was then time for bed and our pillows never felt so good!  *Trannies are men (or formerly men) who've had operations to turn them into women (or something sorta womanish-like) and prostitute themselves out on the streets trying to woo in whoever they can - whether that be kinky gay guys (although if a gay guy sleeps with a man who's now a woman-come-lately does that mean he's straight?) or horny, drunk, and very lost and naive GI's who are in for a nasty surprise!!!  Haha!!!  :-)

      After David Copperfield I went back to Ilsan with the gang and we stayed up late playing Trivial Pursuit, to help us practice for The Contenders.  And I won - yah!  ;-)  The whole quiz show thing is actually a bit up in the air right now.  Andrea's sister back in Canada is very sick and most likely dying and she needs to fly home as soon as possible, however things at her job are making that complicated (long story, but let's just say her boss is a fucking bitch.) She's not sure when she's going to be able to fly home, but it may have to be before we go on the show, which has been tentatively scheduled for June 16.  It would totally suck if she couldn't come on the show with me, but it's for understandable reasons, that's for sure.  Steve is currently on 24-hour back-up notice in case Andrea has to go home earlier than the 16th.  Either way I'm still gonna be on it for sure!  Last night marked the beginning of a 48-hour stretch of time where I spent WAY TOO MUCH TIME on the damn subway.  Out to Ilsan Wednesnday night, back to Shihung on Thursday morning, to Itaewon on Thurs. night, back to Shihung on Friday AM, and then back again to Itaewon Friday evening.  HOLY FUCK!  By the end of it all I was sick of riding those trains!    School was alright on Thursday but I was so excited to see Henry, who was flying in that evening, that it felt like the afternoon was crawling by.  By the time I got off of work it was starting to rain...  Sprinkle turned to drizzle turned to pitter-patter turned to definitely-needing-an-umbrella turned to downpour turned to virtual monsoon!  What a lovely welcome to Korea for Henry!  I met Henry at our motel room that we had rented for the weekend - the Seoul Motel right on the main drag in Itaewon.  It was so cool but SO STRANGE to knock on a motel door in KOREA and see HENRY FROM VANCOUVER answer the door!  We went out for dinner to a casual Western restaurant called Gecko's Tavern and it was so great to catch up with one of my best friends.  We had a nice relaxing dinner then headed up the street to a really cool lounge called SoHo for drinks.  It was a dead evening in Itaewon - the streets were near-empty and we were the only patrons in the lounge!  I guess the monsoon rains* werem keeping a lot of people indoors tonight!  After our drinks we headed back to the motel room for an early night to bed.  Tonight was the beginning of a great little 'mini-vacation' for me that was only 3 days long but felt so much longer.  *okay technically they're not monsoon rains.  Korea doesn't get monsoons (too far north) but it does have a 'rainy season', that typically runs from June to August.  Tonight's rains were just really heavy and how I imagine a monsoon feels like.  I had to put this in cause I know some of you are nit-picky about these details!  ;-)

      It was Buddha's Birthday today - a national holiday - so no work for me today!  I received a phone call from Brad in the morning informing me the gang was going to see David Copperfield that afternoon, and had an extra ticket for sale.  Now I've never really been all that interested in magic shows, and Mr. Copperfield has brought his shows to Vancouver more than once while I lived there and I never paid attention, but a chance to see David Copperfield IN KOREA???  I'm so there!  The show was at 4pm so we all met up earlier before making our way into Sejong Centre to watch 'David Copperfield - An Intimate Evening of Grand Illusion!' as was advertised to us.  Our tickets were the cheapest we could get (about $45 bucks CDN) and were WAY UP HIGH in the balcony in the second-to-back row - true nosebleeds!  David's two hour show turned out to be alright - some of his illusions were in fact pretty darn cool - but like I said before I've never really been all that impressed with magic shows.  Some of his tricks though, I must admit, really did make me go "How'd he do that!!??"  He cut a woman in half and had her severed legs and torso pushed around the stage, made a 1950 Lincoln convertible appear on pedestals while completely surrounded by people (leaving me wondering exactly where it came from!) and rode off a mid-air platform on a motorcycle only to appear two seconds later at the opposite end of the theatre.  Wow!  What was the most interesting part of the show, for me, was watching Mr. I'm-Too-Cool-I'm-The-Greatest-Magician-In-The-World-I've-Got-An-Ego-Ten-Times-The-Size-Of-That-Lincoln-Convertible attempt - and fail horribly - to make the Korean audience laugh, and in the process highly offend them with inappropriate humour.  It's obviously a magic (or 'ILLUSION') oriented show, but David likes to mix it up with silly jokes and stories, all part of the constant 'build-up' he has before the pinnacle of every trick.    One important fact that either David wasn't aware of AT ALL, or just did't care, was that Koreans have a very different style of humour in comparison to North Americans'.  Western humour tends to be based around sarcasm, teasing, and 'dirty' jokes, while Korean humour is much more subtle and 'gentle.'  The sarcasm and the teasing and the dirty jokes went over like a lead bucket - David's jokes either crashed and burned because the Koreans didn't 'get it' (yes, a translator was part of the show who translated everything David spoke) or the result was the audience being offended or confused.  Much of Western humour is just considered outright insulting here in Korea.  There were, in fact, times when all of us just hung our heads in near embarrassment for Mr. Copperfield.  He's say things that we know are inappropriate for Korean audiences, and then look at each other like "did he just *really* say that???"  Some of these things included singling out members of the audience to speak in front of everyone (Koreans are extremely shy to speak in public) and asking them completely inappropriate questions, such as what colour and type of underwear they were wearing, or when the last time they had sex was.  (David used these facts and numbers as part of his tricks.)  Also, everytime he brought someone up on stage he would ask their name, but would inevitable butcher the pronounciation.  This is not unusual for a foreigner to do so, but he would then proceed to MAKE FUN OF THEIR NAME, as if it was a game to play to just a silly word that meant nothing.  And this was to older members of the audience!  In Korea you ALWAYS treat older people with the highest respect and integrity possible.  You DO NOT tease them or make fun of their names which may sound strange to a foreigner's ears in front of 2000 people!  It was an interesting afternoon to say the least!  Between the cool magic tricks and David making an ass out of himself and continually offending over 2000 Koreans, over and over throughout his show, it was quite the sight!  My suggestion to Mr. Copperfield is that he does a little research into a culture before bringing his Western-humour-oriented shows into foreign countries!  This will help to avoid embarrassment and awkwardness for all, and probably increase sales to his over-rated 'evenings of grand illusion!'

      I know I've mentioned this before in past blog entries, but in case you forgot, Korea is a very conservative society.  (At least in comparison to Western cultures, and even in comparison to other places in Asia, such as Japan.)  This conservativeness applies to a lot of things in Korean culture, but particularly applies to romance, dating, and sexuality.  In Korea public displays of affection are a big no-no - the most you'll ever see between a couple in public is the holding of hands or arms around each other's shoulders.  Anything above that is considered offensive and inappropriate for public display.    Most fashion also tends to reflect this conservativeness, although this is rapidly changing with the latest fashion trends among the younger generations.  The older generation still lives in a conservative world where necklines are high, skirts go down to the floor, and a woman's place is in the home serving her husband.  This is in complete contrast to the generation of people my age and younger, who are eager to embrace and adopt Western standards of fashion, gender equality - and overt sexuality.  Turn on M-Net here in Korea (the Korean equivalent of MuchMusic or MTV) and any of today's hottest Korean pop stars look like carboncopies of Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, Asian-style of course.  This contrast has created a huge generation gap - never before have I encountered such a distinct and pronounced difference of values between living generations.  Korea is also a very consumer-based society - wealth and status are measured by how much money one makes, how nice their home is, how extensive their wardrobe is, what labels they wear, what kind of car they drive, etc.  The meeting of these two worlds - the consumption-obsessed society with a younger, more sexually overt generation has resulted in a new phenomenon for Korea that marketers have latched onto like a leech - using sex to sell products.  This concept is certainly not a new one back home - marketers and advertising execs have realized that for sometime now, but here it's just beginning.    Turn on the TV in Korea and within minutes a commercial will come on featuring some pop-star lookalike hawking a brand of soda pop or instant noodles or mobile phone.  Every single home shopping network has *at least* one pretty young thing to keep the male gaze on the screen, and convince the female viewers that they too can look like that if they purchase such said product.  Billboards and posters all across Seoul are now full of Asian Abercrombie & Fitch look-alikes - tight shirts, short skirts, sexy poses, pouty lips, sexually-aggressive embraces, and 'come here big boy' stares in their eyes.  This has resulted in an *explosion* of sales of products that use these advertising tools to attract consumers.  It has been successful beyond belief, and really has appeared out of nowhere.  Using sex to sell has taken Korea by storm, and like a tsunami racing towards shore, it keeps growning and growing.  And all of this is happening much to the horror of the older generation, who react with shock, disapproval, and pure and utter confusion.  It really is two worlds colliding - the old and the young, and the consumerism with sexiness.  I've seen two examples of this in the last week.  I was walking to school the other day and could hear loud music coming from across the street.  I looked across the busy street and saw streamers blowing in the air, loudspeakers BLASTING out pop music, shiny fabric being waved around, and two scantily-clad cheerleader-type girls dancing in perfect choreography - all to announce the opening of a new...bakery...???  Wow - talk about a way to attract customers to come and check out your hot new buns!  ;-)  Ajimas (Korean for 'older women') on my side of the street just gawked in horror and disbelief - their eyes were literally bulging out of their heads...  And then today I was walking home from school and once again heard loud music coming from the direction of the street.  This time a large open-air pickup truck drove past, very slowly, decked out in bright colours, ribbons, balloons, and glitter.  Again speakers were blasting out some technopop music at unbelievably high decibals, while two young Korean girls in itty-bitty silver bikinis danced in the back of the truck.  This time it was to announce that some department store was having a 50% off sale tomorrow!  I've been over-exposed to a lot of overt sexuality in the media and advertising world back home - practically numbed to it if you will, but this sight caught me off-guard, and certainly caused my head to turn and stare - I can only imagine the effect this would have on the Koreans!  Korean culture seems to almost be at war with itself - half the country is desperately holding onto traditional, more conservative Confucian values, while the other half can't get their clothes off fast enough to make a buck or two for 'the man'.  It's a strange phenomenon to watch firsthand, but I enjoy being right in the middle of the battle zone.

      So I've officially passed the 100-day mark!  Wow!  For some reason it feels like a landmark to me.  It's definitely the longest amount of time I've ever spent outside Canada, and by the time my Asian leg of the tour is up, it will have been the longest time spent apart from my family, my Canadian friends, and my Western comfort zone.  It feels like it's flown by, yet at the same time I feel like it's been 3 years, just with all the cool stuff I've been up to.  I sure have packed a lot of experiences and sights into just 100 days!  I can't imagine how it's gonna feel after one full year here - will I be itching to leave, or will it still all feel new and undiscovered?    I'm still very much the foreigner here, but Seoul feels less and less foreign with each passing day.  I can get around town without any difficulty.  I know where to go for shopping.  I have favourite restaurants and coffee houses, favourite streets and neighbourhoods.  I know where to go to surround myself in the hustle and bustle of glorious Asian madness.  I know where to go to escape to relax and unwind.  I know where to take the tourists to show off the city, and I know where the secret hideaways are that only 'locals' know about.  I may not speak very much Korean, but I know enough key words to get me by, and more importantly, to get me out of awkward situations!  This city and this country and this culture, some days, are still strange and confusing and distressing, but those days are becoming fewer and fewer.  I have adjusted and accepted.  I have been thrilled and have thrived.  I have been corrupted and I have conquered.  I have embraced and I have experienced.    And yet there is still so much to see!  So much more to learn!  So many things left to experience!  I don't think anyone could ever complain of boredom here.  In a city this big, in a culture this different and foreign, there is *always* something new left to discover.  Stones still remain, waiting to be turned over.  Streets and alleys still stand, begging to be explored.  Entire neighbourhoods remain that I have yet to step foot into.  It's all very exciting and inspiring and wondrous.  I'm certainly nowhere near an expert, but again, I feel pretty proud of myself for what I've been able to accomplish so far.  I've learned a lot, and feel like I can offer a lot of tips and information to someone who's just arriving here, another foreigner who's 'fresh off the boat.'  Maybe I should start offering courses?  (Life In Korea 101!)  I have one of my best friends from back home, Henry, coming to visit me this weekend, and I'm looking forward to touring him around Seoul.  He'll be my first (and probably only) official guest coming to visit me from back home, and it will be a good test of my knowledge of the city, on what to see, how to get around, etc.  It'll be a little strange at the same time though, someone from my life back home coming into contact with my new life here in Korea.  Talk about 'Two World Collide!'  I'm looking forward to it for sure anyway - it will be a fun and memorable weekend most definitely.  :-)

      Today was an awesome day!!!  Buddha's birthday is this coming Wednesday, and it's probably the biggest holiday all year here in Korea.  Bigger than Christmas, bigger than New Year's, bigger than any of the other Korean religious holidays!  They always have a huge festival for it in Seoul every year, on the weekend before, and that was today!  We headed back into the city and made straight for the festivities - and what a sight it was!  They had closed off several blocks of one of Seoul's main downtown streets and it was packed with all the activities and excitement!  Dozens and dozens of booths lined the sides of the street where you could buy crafts, sample food, browse through artwork and handiwork, and sign up for afternoon activities.  Several stages were found throughout the festival, featuring music and dancing and all other sorts of live entertainment!  It was really packed full of people, and was so beautiful with thousands of lanterns lining the streets and covering all the buildings.  The Lotus Lantern is the main symbol for this event, so people in the city hang up colourful lanterns weeks in advance of Buddha's Birthday.  By the time his birthday arrives the entire city is decked out in beautiful lanterns from top to bottom!  We signed up for a free lantern-making workshop, and it was a blast!  We spent two hours putting together our own individual lanterns, where you attach pieces of coloured paper to a 'blank lantern' in your desired pattern and array of colours.  It was so nice just to hang out and spent the afternoon being creative making our own lanterns.  After we finished we had to turn in our lanterns, which went up on the display tent so that they could be judged later on.  (Prizes would be given out for the best lanterns!)  We were assigned individual numbers so that we could retrieve our luminous creations later on, and so we headed out to enjoy the rest of the festival.    After another hour or so of wandering through the festival, sampling samosas, perusing Nepalese artwork, getting free hand acupunctures, listening to Korean rock bands, and admiring all the thousands of lanterns, we went and had some dinner.  After dinner we went back to the tent where we made our lanterns so that we could retrieve them and head on over to watch the parade.  When we got there we were shocked and saddened to discover that someone had stolen our lanterns!!!  Only Pauline's was left unharmed, whereas mine, Andrea's and Steve's were MIA.  :-(  We were quite disappointed to have our lanterns taken out of our lives so quickly and suddenly, without notice, no chance even for a last goodbye....*sniff sniff*  But I guess we could just look at it as that our lanterns were so fabulous that the culprits couldn't *help* but steal away our magnificent creations, being so spectacular and all....LOL.    We headed on over to the end of the street where the city had closed off another major downtown artery that would be used for the parade.  The parade started not long after sundown, around 7:30pm, and was amazing!  It was one of the biggest parades that I have ever seen, lasting over 2 hours and being comprised of THOUSANDS of dancers and performers and lantern-carrying, Buddha-lovin' Koreans.  To see everyone marching with their lanterns all aglow was truly an amazing sight - such luminous love all around!  The parade had several really cool floats, including giant glowing elephants, colourful pagodas, and HUGE DRAGONS that moved and breathed real fire!  Wow so cool!  We spent about 2 hours watching the parade but we were so tuckered out from our long day that we actually left before the end of it, so I really don't know when the parade ended.  Plus we wanted to back on the trains/busses before the inevitable crush of people at the parade's end.  It was a really great day - perfect weather for a day outside celebrating the life and glory of Buddha!  HOORAY FOR BUDDHA!  (He throws great parties!)  ;-)

      I spent the night at Brad's last night, and it was great to have my first shower again after 3 days of having no plumbing and attempting to make do with sponge baths using water heated from the stove!  LOL!  The water actually came back on earlier than expected on Friday, when I 'experimented' with pulling the faucet and seeing water pour out around mid-day on Friday.  Lesson Of The Week - never take indoor plumbing for granted!!  But it sure was good to have a long shower - ahhh, hot water, firm water pressure, nothing like a good shower in the morning to start the day on a good foot!  :-)  Brad, Andrea, Steve and I took the bus into Seoul and went to an art gallery near one of the palaces.  There was a special exhibit that Brad and Andrea really wanted to see and were quite excited about, and Steve and I naturally tagged along.  The exhibit was a visiting one from Japan, featuring painting and prints from a fairly famous Japanese artist.  The theme of the exhibit was '100 Days at Edo' and featured 100 paintings, all of various city and country scenes of Edo, divided into the four seasons.  The paintings were made quite some time ago (at least a hundred years ago I'm guessing) because they all depicted rather ancient times in the city.  What was cool was that they had recent photographs of the exact same scene as illustrated in the painting right underneath each piece of art.  This allowed the viewers to compare the city scene with the older painting and contemplate how much Edo has changed in a short period - a 'Then & Now' sort of idea.  Really interesting actually!  We spent the rest of the afternoon wandering through Insadong, doing a little window-browsing, and then went over to the palace to watch a re-enactment of the changing of the guards.  Very cool!  It was a hot and sunny day and it was just great to be outdoors! We then had some dinner at a really nice Korean restaurant, and then headed over to a nearby movie theatre to go and watch 'Troy.'  I've been wanting to see this movie FOREVER, and was really excited to go and see it!  It was my first time going to see a movie here in Korea, and I found out that movie theatres in Korea have ASSIGNED SEATING! When you buy your ticket you're given an assigned seat, whether you like it or not.  I guess this has advantages and disadvantages - it's nice cause you can arrive last minute and don't have to worry about not having somewhere to sit, but kinda shitty if you don't like your seats, cause you can't just move somewhere else.  'Troy' turned out to be a really enjoyable film, but I'm always a sucker for historical epics!  After the movie we went and had some ice cream, and then split off.  Brad & Andrea were tired and wanted to head home, and Steve & I were still wanting to hang out more in the city.  Steve & I decided to go and walk up the stairs up Namsam to Seoul Tower to check out the view of the city at night.  It was a warm beautiful night and good hike up the small city mountain.  When we got to the top we were rewarded with a stunning view of sprawling Seoul, all lit aglow - 360 degrees of city lights, as far as the eye can see!  WOW!!  The tower was closing soon so we just hung out around the base - the view from there is still spectacular!  It was only my second time up Namsam and going up there always reminds me of how GIANT this city is.  Even from high up on a mountain you still can't see the end of the city - it just goes on forever in every direction.  After enjoying the glittering visual spectacular, we hiked on back down the mountain steps and took the bus on back to Ilsan.  Steve went straight to bed, but I stayed up a while longer and played Scrabble with Brad & Andrea who were also still awake.  Good times!

      So I have an announcement to make!  You better sit down - this is pretty big news!  Guess what???  I'M GONNA BE ON TV!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :-)  I am thrilled to announce that I will be competing on a Korean quiz show on national television where I will have the chance to win a fabulous trip!!!  WOW!!!!  Its a Jeopardy-style quiz show called The Contenders and is a very popular TV show here in Korea on Arirang (the network that owns and airs the show.)  Yes, it's in English, and how it works is that you compete together on the show in PAIRS against the defending champion, and with each level you advance to, you win a bigger trip!!  Andrea is my partner, and tonight we went for our pre-interview down at the TV station in SE Seoul.  When we got the Arirang TV Tower we had to sign several consent forms, and then answer several questions about our team (ie: hobbies, favourite subjects, nationality, why you're here in Korea, etc.)  There were three other pairs of people who will also be competing on the show at some point.  We all had to choose team names, and so Andrea & I will be known as 'Posh & Bex'!  There is a bit of a long story, involving an inside joke between Andrea and I, as to why we chose this for our team name, but basically our team is named after the super-celebrity couple of the millennium - David Beckham and his wife Victoria 'Posh Spice.'  'Posh & Becks' is how the Brits affectionately call the couple, but due to limited letters allowed, we had to shrink it down to 'Posh/Bex'.  We all then had to fill our a short quiz to find out exactly how smart each team is - this will help the show producers in matching up appropriate teams.  The quiz was actually harder than I thought it would be, but overall I think I did alright, as did Andrea.  Andrea and I constantly joke about becoming famous in Korea, and we hope that this show will be our 'big break' into Korean superstardom!  Who knows?  Fastforward a month or so from now and Andrea and I could be the 'Posh & Becks' of Korea!  Press conferences, photo shoots, autograph sessions, magazine cover shots, TV interviews, award ceremony presentations, tours across Asia, product endorsements, offers for careers in film and music - all these could soon be within our reach!  I can taste the fame already!!!  In all honesty most of this is just a joke to us.  We just think it would be cool to be on TV, and hey you never know, we might actually do well on the show and win a trip!  (Trips include destinations such as Jeju Island, China, Japan, Thailand, Hawaii, USA, and Europe!)  We don't actually expect to go all that far, nor become famous, but it's a lot of fun in the meantime to imagine these crazy scenarios, and I think it will be a blast to be on the show!  We're supposed to know in the next week or two when we're gonna be on - hopefully sooner rather than later!!!  So everyone, gather up your pom-poms and get ready to cheer on Andrea & Scotty (aka: Posh & Bex!) as they compete for fame and fortune on THE CONTENDERS!!!  WOOHOO!!!  :-)

      So, after seven long gruelling hours on this damn computer, I finally have all of my photos uploaded onto a website for all you guys to check out!  I'm using a site called Splashbulb, and it is really user-friendly and fun to use.  Not only can you view my photos, but you can also rate them, write comments, and even order copies of them online! The only catch is this, well actually there's two catches...  The first one is that you have to have enabled your web browser to accept cookies in order to check out the photos.  I know, I know, we all hate cookies, I do too, they're a pain in the ass, but if you wanna see my photos that's just what you're gonna have to do (if the settings on your computer don't already allow them!)  Worse comes to worse you can adjust the cookies settings temporarily just to view my photos, then set it back once you're finished, right?  The second is that this website works on a special elitist invite-only system.  You can ONLY view my photos if you have received a special invitation via email.  Now the only way I can do that is by adding in each of your individual email addresses into my Super Special Much-Coveted Royally-Fantastic *THE* Club Of All Clubs Invite List!  Because the majority of you have multiple email addresses, I wasn't sure which ones to add.  So, if you wanna see my amazing, breath-taking, awe-inspiring photos of my adventures here in Korea, send me your email address, being sure to give me the one that you will want to use for all time to access these prize photos.  You can do this by either emailing me personally, or just by leaving a comment to this entry.  Remember - no email address sent to me by you means no photos for you!  I'm excited to share all my adventures with you guys!  I've got lots and lots of terrific shots and I think seeing these photos will make all my stories and blog entries seem that much more real and vivid to you.  I hope you like 'em!  Be sure to let me know what you think of the photos once you've seen them!    ENJOY!  :-)

      So last night before going to bed I had to have one last hot shower before the water was turned off.  I made sure it was a really long shower, and tried to savour the sensation of the hot luscious water pouring over my firm and supple naked body, slowly lathering myself with rich creamy foam, moaning over the pleasure of the beating heat of the powerful water on my tired muscles.....oh wait...this is a blog, not a porno....    WHOOPS!!!  SORRY!!!  HAHA!!!  ;-)  Anyways it was a great shower, and it could be the last one I have until Friday night.  (Although I am in the process of developing plans to invade the showers of friends of mine who live in the city!)  I woke up today and it was just weird to not go automatically into my morning routine of shower-dress-breakfast-computer.  My hair is looking pretty flat and limp, but I figured that since the whole city is without water I won't be the only one looking 'less-than-best' at work today.  After work today I decided that I really REALLY needed a haircut.  Since my last haircut disaster I've been putting the next one off as long as I could, since I really didn't know where to go.  I didn't want to go back to the same place, but don't know where else to go.  I mean, to find a hair stylist that can speak English *and* won't butcher my hair seems like Mission:Impossible here in Korea.  Michael has since found his old hair stylist - the one who cuts amazing hair and he's been going to her for over a year - so maybe I should give her a shot?  Well the thing is she's located in some shop really far away (even farther than COEX which is the site of The Great Bad Haircut of 2004 that took place 6 weeks ago) and he couldn't remember the address and she doesn't really speak English and I wouldn't even know where to look....  It was just too difficult - I really would need Michael to BRING me there and help me, and I know that he's too busy during the week and stuff.  So I decided to give the lady at COEX another chance.  I mean everyone in life deserves a second chance, right?  Maybe she was just having an 'off day' when I saw her last?  This turned out to be a big mistake!!!    Once again, the same lady has given me another shitty haircut!!  God - that makes two horrific hair disasters in a row!!!  This sort of calamity is unprecedented in the history of my hair!  I mean I've had bad hair cuts here and there, but TWO BACK TO BACK???  This is just unheard of!  The Hair Gods must truly be punishing me for my many years of hair vanity that I'll quickly confess to.    I'm not quite as distressed about it as I was last time.  Maybe cause this time I was almost sorta expecting it again...  Either way I'm not going to ever go back to her, and I'm not going to wait another 6 weeks for my next hair cut!  I've got a plan of action, and it starts tomorrow!  I'm gonna steal some scissors from school, and do a little snippety-snip-snip myself after work.  Now I'm certainly no trained hair stylist, and definitely no fool, so I'm going to be *very cautious* about this and just do a little trim here and there.  I mean the lady left HUGE CHUNKS left uncut so it shouldn't be that hard for me to spot where to cut.  And secondly, I'm going to phone up Michael and BEG HIM to take me to this other stylist of his sometime soon - probably next weekend (he's got a guest coming in town from Taiwan this weekend so no go for me!)  Maybe she can do some serious damage control and help out a brother with his hair.  I'm even willing to go SHORTER if it means a better style.  Anything is better than what I have now!  *sigh*  ;-)

      So Tuesday was an uneventful day, until I got a phone call from Steven that night after work.  He informed me that starting Wednesday morning, I was going to have no water for the next three days!!!  AND THAT'S NO WATER AT ALL!!!  No tap water!  No toilet!  And no shower!!!  What the fuck!!??  You've got to be joking, right???  RIGHT!!!?????  At first I just thought either I was confused or that his English wasn't translating over well or that he was misinformed or something, cause I just couldn't believe that the water was going to be turned off for three whole days!  I mean, what on Earth would cause such a thing?  Was there a war or earthquake happening that I wasn't aware of? Apparently 'they' (no idea who 'they' are - the waterworks company I'm assuming) are going to be replacing a water main, and so that's why I am going to lose my water.  But it isn't just our house, or even just our street, or even just our neighbourhood...  But it's ALL OF SHIHUNG CITY!!!  And no only just that, but also Anyan, which is the suburb next to us, and even some parts of Seoul!    JUST HOW BIG IS THIS WATER MAIN!!!???  And if it's just *one single pipe* that separates a million Seoulites from being without water at all, then man, they've got some serious problems underneath this city!  Talk about a fragile waterworks system!!!  Where am I?  Seoul, or Calcutta???  Okay, so let's say that it's the biggest mother of a water main there ever was that needs to be replaced, fair enough.  But what?  You can't figure out a way to re-route water through another pipe so that the lives of a million people aren't disrupted (as well as businesses and schools and such) for three whole days?  I mean come on!!  Seoul is a modern and high-tech city!  Korea is an advanced and industrialized nation!  This is the sort of thing that I'd expect to happen in Third World countries, not in a country with the 12th largest economy in the world!  I mean get it together people!  You can build high-speed bullet trains across the country, you can have the most crazy advanced futuristic cell phones I've ever imagined in the hands of every citizen, you can even be the first country in the world to clone human stem cells (the Koreans accomplished this back in February), but you somehow can't figure out how fix one measely pipe without shutting off water completely to entire suburbs!!???  What kind of crazy place is this??   LOL!  What's even funnier is how accepting and complacent and non-chalant everyone here is about it!  Steven's tone on the phone was the same as if he was telling me that my classes were going to start an hour early the next day, or something insignificant like that.  The only people who seem to be freaking out about this are the foreigners!  I phoned Ailish up the street and she was as confused and surprised about it as I was!  We both commented how this is something that would NEVER EVER happen in Canada or Ireland!  CAN YOU IMAGINE if like Dublin or Ottawa were cut off water for three whole days?  Entire governments would be impeached and respective parliamentary buildings would be burned to the ground by angry rioters!  haha!!  But hey I guess this kind of event is 'normal' (?) here in Korea, so when in Rome, I guess...  Susan came down shortly after the phone call to help me prepare for the next three days.  We filled up my washing machine with water so I'd have a reserve for washing and stuff, and she also gave me a giant-ass basin to fill up as well.  So I will have water in my apartment, it just won't be running.  Or heated.  I'm still not sure how this 'no shower' thing is going to go over with me.  I mean I haven't showered for a couple consecutive days before, like while camping or something, but never in a situation like this.  Like is the whole city going to SMELL come Friday?  And more importantly, what am I going to do about my hair???  I simply can't have *bed head* for three straight days in a row!!!!  haha!!!  Well, it should be an interesting three days, that's for sure!  Stay tuned for more drama from this side of the Pacific!  Wish me luck!  :-)

      God did I ever spend a fortune today!!!  I woke up this morning and there was absolutely nothing in my cupboard at all to eat, so I went and bought a big load of groceries.  After work today I decided to go and drop off some film as I now had five rolls waiting to get developed!  Last week I had noticed that at the giant E-Mart department store at Bucheon Station there was a Fuji Film Centre that did one hour photo, so that's where I headed to.  I dropped off my film and had an hour to kill so I wandered around the department store just browsing away.  I then found myself on the floor that has a grocery store.  Well I'm always up for exploring a new grocery store cause you just never know what treats you'll discover there!  And man did I ever hit the jackpot here!!!  I found so many treats that I just haven't been able to find in my own local neighbourhood - I bought bagels and cream cheese, peanut butter, butter-flavoured microwave popcorn, Western-style brown baked beans, and then I came across the best discovery yet to date...  I was just aimlessly wandering through the crowded aisles and came across the alcohol section (yes, you can buy booze in grocery stores in Korea!)  and there I saw it, like a mirage in the desert teasing my disbelieving eyes...  HOOCH!!!  For those of you who are yet to be enlightened, Hooch is a type of cooler, a sparkling fruity alcoholic drink that comes in a variety of flavours and is really really yummy!  The reason why I am so partial to Hooch is more for sentimental reasons actually, rather than taste-preference.  The first time I ever got drunk was on Hooch while in London on a high school trip way back in March of '96!  It became my beverage of choice on that trip, and it spawned a whole cult culture amongst my trip peers and all my friends back home.  I fell in love with the drink, and my friend Lisa became obsessed with it too even though she wasn't on the trip!    Hooch even spawned a whole comic book series that Lisa and I created, where we were both super heroes (Super Scotty and Lightning Lisa) and we used Hooch Power to fight the forces of evil.  We even later developed a comic series called The Paris Chronicles where Lisa and I are trying to make our way to Paris but keep running into evil bad guys along the way (mainly in the way of one hated teacher who we turned into a character called Leatherpants - yes he wore them to school for real.)  In the comic we discovered that by smashing a bottle of Hooch a portal would open up and we could jump back (and forward) into time and travel to distant lands to escape, and further destroy, the evils that Leatherpants sought to reap upon the Earth.  (Yes, I was a big geek back in high school and had way too much spare time on my hands!!!  LOL!!)  Anyways seeing the bottles of Hooch on the shelves brought me on a virtual trip down memory lane, and since I haven't drank any Hooch in years and years, I bought a couple bottles to enjoy at home.  Needless to say I was quite excited about this unexpected find in the grocery store!!!    I finished my shopping and went up and retrieved my film.  It cost me $60 CDN to get them all deleveoped - OUCH - but it was well worth it.  The pictures turned out great and I was really excited to get them back!  What's even cooler is that I was able to get all five rolls put onto CD-ROM also, so that I can share them with all my friends and family!  What I hope to do is to upload all the pictures onto a website that allows you to display photos and write captions for them, so that everyone who's interested in seeing them can check them out at their own leisure.  I have no idea what websites do this (for free, that don't involve signing up for some account like you have to do with Yahoo, and that's really easy to use for people who are dumb with computers like me!)  If anyone has any websites they can reccommend to me that are good for this sort of stuff, please let me know!  I really wanna share all my photos with everyone!  The sooner you let me know, the sooner I can start sharing all these great photos of me in Asia!

      We all slept in fairly late today, and didn't get rolling until much later than what we had originally planned.  We drove on over to the East Gate entrance of Sorakhsan National Park to explore around there for a while.  Upon arrival we were instantly confirmed that this gate indeed was the infamously crowded entrance.  There was a long line of traffic funnelling into the park and attendants actually directed you as to where to park in the parking lot.  Tour bus after tour bus was arriving and there was a steady stream of people making their way into the park.  Oh, crowded Korea...  The weather was sunny and hot today, and it was a beautiful day to gaze at the enormous jagged peaks of Sorakhsan.  Unlike the triangular-shaped peaks of Canada's West Coast, Sorakhsan's mountains are very jagged and craggedy (a word?) - the peaks are rough and chunky and the rock is a light-brown coloured.  Kinda hard to explain it, but amagnificent sight nonetheless.  Perhaps it was the weather or maybe the crowds, or most likely just because of our big hike the day before, but all four of us were feeling SO TIRED AND LAZY!  Gone was our boundless energy we had the day before - we just dragged our sorry asses through the park and felt much less-inclined to race up any of the slopes.  We went and checked out the GIANT statue of Buddha in the park, and then explored a nearby temple.  We were probably only in the park an hour and a bit and we were all so tired we decided to bail out.  The crowds were just too much anyways, and there were other things we wanted to check out anyway.  We headed on over to Sokcho Beach to relax in the sun instead.  We changed into our bathing suits (wishful thinking) and found a spot in the soft sand to relax.  The colour of the East Sea (known as the Sea of Japan by the outside world) was a beautiful and dazzling aquamarine turquoise - very Caribbean-like (not that I've ever seen the Caribbean, but how I imagine it to be I guess!)  We all put our toes in to feel the sparkling waters, and were met with a sudden reality check - the water was ABSOLUTELY FREEZING!!!  Colder than Lake Superior, colder than Shebandowan in the spring.  "Colder than a witch's tit" as my Mom would say!  lol ;-)  Well Michael was feeling especially bold and brave, so he actually took a run and leapt right into the near-frozen but oh-so-pretty turquoise waters.  His scream upon entering the frigid liquid reconfirmed that yes, indeed, it was god damn cold!!!  He was RIGHT IN, RIGHT OUT of the water faster than you can say 'Got Hypothermia?'!  Well machismo kicked in and Eric and I decided that we couldn't let Michael be the only alpha-male brave (or stupid, depending on how you look at it) enough to take the plunge, so this time all three of us boys made the run and dove right on in....  HOLY FUCK WAS IT COLD!!!!  Next to my brief swim in the Mediterranean when I was visiting Nice in March '97 this was definitely the coldest water I've ever felt in my life!!!  I knew it was going to be cold, but not *THAT* COLD!  Like what the fuck, is there some sort of ocean current that pumps in freezing water directly from Siberia and delivers it straight to Korea, icebergs and all?  LOL!  It was fun and exhilirating though, and I'm glad I did it (I'm still looking for my balls though, which brought new meaning to the term 'cold-water shrinkage')   Maeve just took pictures and laughed at all of us crazy boys, and we were attracting a lot of attention from nearby Koreans on the beach as well.  The entire beach seemed to be in disbelief over what we had done!  Hey, I'm always up for putting on a show, so I'm glad I could once again entertain the crowds of confused Koreans - seems to be a daily ritual in my life these days!  ;-)    After drying off and getting dressed in warmer clothes again, we decided to make our way over to the nearby Sokcho Fish Market.  This turned out to be my favourite part of the day!  The Fish Market is a long street that hugs the waterfront where all the local fishermen bring in their daily catch to sell to the locals.  They literally pull up on shore, moore their boats, drag out their sea-licious catch, and plop it down into tanks or buckets for whoever to buy.  Seafood really doesn't get any fresher than this!  Wandering through the fish market really is like wandering through the Vancouver Aquarium - there were ocean creatures of every species, colour, size, aand spectacle!  Many of the tanks had sea creatures that I couldn't even tell you what they were!  There were giant fish, octupi, squid, crabs, clams and mussels, eels, sea urchents, shrimp and scallops, and all other kinds of squishy ocean things.  Some of the fish were absolutely massive - so big and heavy that it would take a very strong person to be able to lift them out of the tank!  (Certainly enough to feed a Korean family for a week!)  The best part was when we came across this tank of crabs.  Now there's tanks of crabs all over this fish market, but this particular fisherman seemed to know exactly where to catch all the Granddaddy Crabs of the sea - they were the biggest fucking crabs that I have ever seen in my life!!!  ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE!!!  Seriously, some of them, if you laid them out from toe to toe, would probably measure at least THREE FEET LONG!!!   Where do the hell do these giant crab monsters live?  And more importantly, do they ever come on shore???  Can you imagine being at the beach, all warm and relaxed on your towel, covered in tanning lotion, just catching some rays, and then looking over to see a CRAB BIG ENOUGH TO CARRY AWAY A PONY coming at you???  I'd probably have a heart attack...  Well I guess the fisherman noticed how excited we were over his crabs (we were taking pictures of ourselves next to the tank) cause he came over and decided to give us something even more exciting to take a picture of...  He reached in, with his bare hands, and grabbed one of these super giant crabs and just chucked the thing down on the street RIGHT IN FRONT OF US!  All four of us *SCREAMED* like little school girls and jumped back about three feet in a single bound!!  OMG!!!  We couldn't believe that one of these creatures from the black lagoon was now loose and crawling around on the pavement near our feet - no thick tank glass to protect us now!!!  We laughed as much as we screamed, and Eric was even brave enough to kneel down next to 'the thing' so we could take a picture.  SO CRAZY!!!  We wandered through the rest of the market and just marvelled at all the sea creatures that you could buy and eat - stuff that I didn't even know was edible.  I think it's the Korean's philosophy that absolutely *anything* from the sea is edible to them.  Not for me, thanks!  ;-)  We were hungry so we stopped at one of the nearby stalls and ordered a fresh seafood snack.  We had some delicious grilled prawns, some shellfish (I passed on those) and then some squid stuffed with rice and octopus like a big fat purple sack!  I was feeling a bit brave and a had a sample of the rice/squid and it was actually not bad I must admit!    After this it was time for us to make the big drive back to Seoul and head on home.  We hit the highway and enjoyed the breathtaking views of Sockcho and the coast as we climbed back up and over the mountains, westward bound.  We were making great time getting home but then about half way back to the city we hit 'The Wall.'  'The Wall' is the end of the line of traffic heading back into Seoul - a fluctuating yet permanent line of cars that appears at the end of every weekend, regardless of the time of year.  We ended up just *crawling* back into the city on the highway and it was so frustrating to be stuck in the car!  What is normally only a four-hour drive from the East Coast back to Seoul turned into a 6.5 hour ordeal.  Another reminder that Korea is a very small, yet very crowded country.  Michael told us that he knows of people who've driven back after a long weekend in the summer and it's taken them 12 HOURS to get back to Seoul because of all the traffic, so I guess 6.5 isn't all that bad after all.  Still, not a fun experience anyways!  By the time we got into the city it was almost 11pm and we were all soooo tired.  We said our goodbyes and then I hopped on the subway and headed on home.  A tiring end to a really great weekend!!!!  :-)

      After a very restful sleep in our love motel room, the four of us got showered up and dressed for our big day of hiking.  We went and had some lunch in town and then drove on over to nearby Sorakhsan National Park.  Sorakhsan to Korea is what Banff is to Canada - it is the prime jewel in Korea's crown of national parks - the most beautiful, the most famous, and the most crowded!  Sorakhsan is known for its INSANE CROWDS but luckily the bulk of the traffic is concentrated in and around the East Gate of the park near Sokcho, and we were entering from the northwest side at a gate that receives very little traffic.  We found our trail entrance and made our way into the spectacular Sibiseonnyeotang Gorge.  The Gorge (as it will now be known as, cause I don't want to have to write its name out more than once) is a small but beautiful canyon that slices its way deep into the park.  A small river/large stream runs through the gorge and forms many beautiful waterfalls, rapids, and calm pools of crystal clear water.  We spent over five and a half hours hiking the trail in and out of the gorge and it was incredibly beautiful.  So quiet, so serene, so scenic, and so not like other hiking trails in Korea!  In Korea's national parks on weekends it's not uncommon for it to be SO BUSY that people actually have to queue up just to get *onto* a trail - most trails in Korea are in fact just very long lines of people moving up the mountain like ants.  It's even not uncommon for most national parks to have to PAVE their hiking trails because of the incredible volume of people that track through every weekend!  CRAZY!  This hike however, was completely unlike that.  During our whole day in the gorge we came across maybe 4 or 5 other groups of people.  Otherwise, it felt like we had the park to ourselves.  What was funny was with the fresh air, lush green forest, and cool grey weather, I totally felt like I could've been hiking in a park back in British Columbia!  I had to keep reminding myself that I was in Korea, not back home in Canada!  It was much more of an intense hike than we thought it would be - certainly no leisurely walk through the woods!  The terrain was quite steep in portions, and in some sections you had to use a rope to climb up or down, or just hold onto so you don't plunge into the river below!  (Barb you wouldn't have liked this hike - too many heights for you babe!)  It was a great workout for us and the MASSIVE WATERFALL at the end of the trail (well, as far as we had planned to venture in that day) was well worth the long hike.  We sat across from the waterfall and relaxed and ate cookies, enjoying the spectacular site of the rushing water carving out a massive slice through the hard granite.  So amazing!!!  It was then time to make our way back to the car.  A great hike, albeit quite challenging, but very beautiful and well worth it in the end!   By the time we got back to the car we were SO TIRED but feeling proud of our big hiking accomplishment.  We got back on the highway and headed for the coast where we were planning to spend the night.  The drive to the East Coast of Korea was a beautiful one, with the highway winding up and over several large mountains, forcing us to drive very slowly through some hair-pin turns on the mountain switchbacks!  We arrived in the port city of Sokcho around 7:30pm and were happy to find a hotel room.  We were even more happy when we found out that just around the corner was a large water park with A HOT TUB THAT WE COULD SOAK IN!  The only catch was that the park closed at 8:30pm and didn't allow anyone in after 8pm.  The four of us RACED into the hotel room, madly threw on our bathing suits, and sped on over to Waterpia.    We arrived at exactly 8:01pm and were turned away by the bitchy cunt who was giving out tickets at the door.  "I've done all my counting for the night and I don't want to do anymore" was her response to us (in Korean, luckily we had Eric to translate.)  We all wanted to bitch slap her so she directed us to the Manager, who was nice enough to let all of us in afterall!  Again, we madly raced through the locker rooms and dove on in to that hot tub.  Dear God did it ever feel good!!!  We all had one giant communal sigh of relief and relaxation when we sat in that tub, and none of us moved an inch from that luscious hot water.  Yeah there was waterslides and wave pools and tube runs that we could've played in, but all we wanted was to soak our tired muscles in that hot tub.  And it was so worth it - it was like heaven in a hot pot!!!  :-)  After our soak we went out for dinner to Pizza Hut and were all absolutely famished so we ate a disgusting amount of food.  Even though we ate until we wanted to puke we still had room for ice cream later on, so we grabbed some dessert and headed back to the hotel room.  We rented two movies - 'To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything, Julie Newmar' and 'Ocean's Eleven' but only made it through 'To Wong Foo'!  We were completely exhausted so we hit the sack and had a wonderful, long, deep sleep.  Ahhhhh!  :-)

      I noticed today that all day long all of my kids were especially hyper and frantic in each of my classes.  There was an extra buzz in the school and they all seemed to be talking very quickly and excitedly amongst each other.  I had no idea what all of this was about, but then one of them came up to me and started to practically hyperventilate about something about a 'Red Mask.'  She seemed almost distressed about this and so I inquired about it with more students.  Most of them were so excited they could barely get any English out - all I kept hearing was something about a 'Red Mask' and 'Japan' and then they'd make a scary face at me.  I was totally clueless!  I wouldn't find out the answer until later that night...  My day ended again at 5:20pm today - that makes 2 full weeks of work now where I only work 3 hours a day (because adult classes haven't started yet) but still get paid for a full day's work.  Awesome!  I came home and packed up my bag for everything I would need for the weekend.  I was going on a roadtrip with Michael and a few of his friends to Sorakhsan National Park and the East Coast of Korea and I was so excited about it!  MY FIRST ROAD TRIP IN ASIA!  Actually  my first road trip *anywhere* in ages it seems.  I packed way too many clothes, as usual, and lugged all my shit onto the trains and went into Itaewon to meet up with Michael.  I actually made it to Michael's apartment before he did, so I camped outside his apartment door waiting for him to return.  While waiting I got to meet his neighbour, which were interesting to say the least....  Michael's neighbour is a trans-gendered hooker (a man dressed as a woman, who I think has had surgery to remove his 'extra bits', and now prostitutes him/herself on the streets.)  She was having 2 friends over (all very tall 'women!') and they all stared at me with confused glances as to why I was camped out in the hallway.  Let's just say that there was mutual confusion traded back in those curious stares!  Michael arrived later, he packed up his bags, and it was time to go.  His friend Eric arrived just then and the 3 of us drove out to Bundang to pick up Michael's friend Maeve.  The four of us then made a pit-stop for ice cream and chocolate (what road trip is complete without junk food?) and then hit the highway out of the city.  Traffic was light heading out of Seoul and we were making great time heading out east across Korea.  I was surprised at how long it took to get out of Seoul's endless suburbia - over and hour and a half on the highway outside of the city and yet we were still in the city's 'fringes'....  Just how far does one have to go to escape this city?  It was just love motel after love motel for miles and miles it seems.  Now what's a love motel you may ask?  A love motel is an inexpensive hotel where men go to bring their mistresses or hookers or whoever they're sleeping with that's not their wife for a little 'alone time' away from their families.  These gawdy-looking neon hotels are all over the city, but tend to cluster along the city's edges where the men can go and feel safe that they won't be discovered by their wives or friends.  These love motels cater almost entirely to this market, and even have curtains that hang over the parking lot entrances so that you can't identify the vehicles that are parked inside...total privacy and anonymity (sp?) guaranteed!    Another hour later we were out in the dark countryside out in the rolling hills and it was really quiet and pretty.  While chatting with Maeve I finally found out the truth behind what all this 'Red Mask' stuff is that my kids were so excited about.  The Red Mask is a Korean urban legend, (but all the kids believe are real) and is quite the unusual story.  Apparently it's about a woman who was rather ugly, so she went to go and get plastic surgery to make herself more beautiful.  Well the surgery went horribly wrong, and she was left with a scarred face and a HUGE permanent grin from ear to ear - a giant smile that never disappears.  Well I don't know if she died or if she killed herself, but anyways lets just say her spirit has a lot of emotional baggage leftover yet to be dealed with.  She's apparently from Japan but what she does every year, on this one day, is travel across the Sea of Japan to Korea (float?  swim?  KoreanAir?  I don't know) and between the hours of 6-8pm seeks out new victims in Korea.  How she attacks is she appears to you in your home, or wherever, and asks you if you think she's pretty.  If you say yes, she leaves you alone.  If you say no, or if she doesn't believe you, she cuts your face open to give you a grin just like hers, and then hacks up your body or something like that.  LOVELY!!!!  (Now I can see why the kids get so excited and frightened over this!  So gruesome!)  We made it into the small city of Inje near the edge of Sorakhsan National Park sometime between 2am and 3am.  It was only about 4 hours that we spent on the road but it had felt so much longer - we were all so tired!  We pulled into a motel and got a room for the night.  We're fairly certain that this was a love motel for two reasons...  The first one being that our room rate suddenly went up an extra 10,000 won as soon as they found out that there was a woman staying in the room, and not just guys....  Hmmm....  And the other reason was that when we got to our room and went to turn off the lights to go to bed, Maeve accidentally hit a different switch...  Well the main lights went off but this red light glowing from the ceiling came on instead, lighting the entire motel room in a soft red glow, very a-la-porno movie!  We kept waiting for the mirrors to appear out of the ceiling and the soft porn music to start up in the background!  Oh those funny Koreans!  We all had a good laugh about the red light and then went to sleep.

      So in the past I've done a lot of bitching about Korean food that I don't like, well here's the reverse - an ode to all the yummy Korean food that I really enjoy, and will no doubt miss when I leave.  1) Bibimbap - I've talked about this in the past before, but it's so damn good that it deserves another mention.  Bibimbap is most often a favourite among foreigners, and it's certainly won me over!  It's best when served in a bowling hot stove pot, and consists of steamed exotic vegetables served over rice with some spicy red bean paste sauce.  The dish is so hot they throw an egg on top of all of this and it cooks right then and there.  You mix it all together, throw in a little more sauce perhaps, and dive in.  Mmmm...so yummy, and so healthy! (and always vegetarian - hooray!)  2) Red Bean Paste - Soooooo spicy, and so tasty!  I couldn't handle this stuff when I first moved here, but now I love it!  There's actually a lot of really good spicy sauces here in Korea - a great work out for your taste buds and sure-fire way to clear your sinuses!  3) Chicken Dish - I forget the Korean name for this, but it's the one where you sit at a table in front of a giant grill and cook your own strips of chicken with mixed vegetables yourself at your table.  You then throw in some spicy sauce, stir it all together, and then scoop it into lettuce leaves to eat like a little wrap.  Ultra yummy!  4) Fruits & Milk - the Koreans are all about flavoured milk!  I thought this was gross at first but now I'm a full-fledged addict.  At any given moment my fridge is always stocked with at least one variety of flavoured milk.  Banana and strawberry are my favourites, but it comes in all sorts of flavours!  I'll *totally* miss this stuff when I go home!  5) Steven's Mother's Pancakes - When we had the kindergartens at work, Steven's Mom always made them lunch and mid-afternoon snacks everyday, a lot of which I wasn't too crazy about, but her pancakes are TO DIE FOR!  They're just regular pancakes, but rolled and then covered in sugar - very much like a crepe.  They're so simple but for some reason they're so fuckin' delicious!  Now that we don't have the kindergartens she doesn't cook at school anymore - so sad!  6) Baked Goods - Every single street corner in Korea has *at least* one bakery on it!  Bakeries are HUGELY POPULAR and there's several major bakery chains that can be found all across Korean cities - Crown Bakery, Tous Les Jours, Paris Baguette - lots of really yummy places.  And Korean bakeries are THE SHIT!  They serve up the tastiest little treats you can't even imagine - half the time I don't know what they are but they taste really good anyways!  My favourite are Tous Les Jours' apple streudels - solid gold baby!  7) Ottogi Ketchup - Forget Heinz!  I'm all about Ottogi Ketchup now!  This is a brand of condiments that is really popular in Korea and they're ketchup is awesome.  It's hard to explain, I mean yes it is "just ketchup", but it seems to have this little extra spice in it that makes it that much more memorable.  It goes great with my grilled cheese sandwiches!  8) Rice Drink - This comes in a variety of forms (can be wine-like, or more like juice most of the time) but it's really quite tasty.  Definitely an acquired taste though.  The smell of it is enough to put anyone off, but if you can get past the smell the flavour is really delicious!  Andrea loves this stuff so I often steal a bit of hers!  Well that's my list for now - I was just shooting it off at random as it came out of my head.  I know there's lots more that I enjoy, but those are probably all my favourites.  YUMMY STUFF!!!!  ;-)

      So it was back into work early this morning to do some more textbook recording.  It was all fairly ordinary for the first little bit, with me recording words from harmless innocent topics such as colours, fruit, vegetables, days of the week, kinds of weather, family members. etc....and then suddenly I came to the 'Medical' section of the text. This is a section of our textbook that I haven't seen up until now, and then next thing I knew I was reading outloud and recording words such as 'pediatrics', 'psychiatry', 'radiology', 'dermatology' (wow getting difficult here, especially considering that this textbook is for readers who are CHILDREN) and then it was 'ophthalmology' (no idea what this means, have never heard this word before, had to guess how to pronounce it) and then I had to record...'gynecology'...  What the...???   *did a big double-take and came so close to BURSTING out laughing*  Why the hell would a nine-year old need to know the meaning of 'gynecology'???  Dear Lord I hope I don't have to explain that one to the kids in class at some point!  What the hell would I say? (that would make sense to them and still be appropriate for young ears?)  It was hilarious anyways....  Today was Jessica's birthday and this past weekend she had invited me to her birthday dinner, so I thought I'd go and celebrate with her this evening.  The dinner was way out at the TGI Friday's out in Ilsan which means 2 hours on 1 bus and 4 trains just to get there.  It's a long ways to go, but hey I had no plans tonight anyways so may as well, right?  So I made the great trek out there and actually arrived on time - if that journey isn't proof of dedication I don't know what is!  :-)  There was a big gang there for dinner including lots of faces that were new to me.  Dinner was great and the party was fun - gotta love birthdays!  Next thing I knew it was quarter after ten and time for me to make the same great trek all the way back home.  I decided to take the bus to Seoul instead and then catch my train from there as that usually shaves off some time, but I wasn't sure where to catch the bus from this part of town.  Emilie, Kelsey, and Amy left the same time as I did and tried to help me find the right bus stop.  The really frustrating thing about taking the bus in Korea is that the busses only stop at certain stops on a street, and they are not often labelled so you have to guess if you're at the right stop.  And even then, busses here don't stop automatically, you have to 'hail' them down by stepping out into the street or waving at them, otherwise they'll just drive right by barrelling ahead...  Well we tried to hail a few busses but none of them would stop.  Hmmm...must be the wrong stop...  I walked up the street to the next one and tried the same thing, but alas, had the same response!  Fuck man what does one have to do to catch a bus around here!  I ended up having to walk like 10-15 minutes in the pouring rain up the street all the way to the next subway station before finding a bus stop where I could actually catch a bus!  Grrrr....  At this point I was worried about missing my train at City Hall Station which would leave me stranded in the city.  I got into City Hall Station just before 11:30pm which is roughly when the trains stop running.  I made a b-line to the ticket office convinced that I had still made it in time (just) to catch the last train.  I ran up to Mr. Ticket Man and was told that I had just missed it...by 3 minutes....  ARRRGHHHH!!!!!  NO WAY TO GET HOME NOW!  I'm not going to cab it home from here cause that would cost a *FORTUNE*, so I called up my friend Michael in Itaewon and begged and pleaded to him to let me crash at his place overnight.  He just laughed and said 'yeah come on over!'  I'm lucky to have good friends!  Getting to Michael's from City Hall proved to be another challenge!  Taxis are aplenty in Seoul, but catching one, and actually finding one that *wants* to go where you do is another story!  I stood on the street corner trying to flag one down, but empty taxi after empty taxi just raced by...  Finally one stopped and I asked 'Itaewon?' to see if that was cool.  He just shook his head and sped off, nearly running over my foot in the process!  Yes, that's right,  taxi drivers here choose you, you don't choose them.   It's really fucking annoying, I have to say, and Seoul is the only city in the world I've ever been that does that.  A driver will only take you somewhere if he feels like it, and they tend to be *really* picky about their destinations.  There's been times in the past when I've asked like 10 taxis to take me somewhere and I've been turned down 10 times in a row.  It's like who pays your fares buddy???  THE CUSTOMER!!!  HELLO!!!  Finally I found a cab that would take me, and I went over to Michael's to crash.  We stayed up for a bit just chatting and then went to bed around 1:30am.  An unplanned detour, but it was fun to hang with Michael anyways.

      This week I'm helping Steven with a project at work.  Our elementary students are competing in an English-speaking Contest in August which is an annual big event in our province.  To help the kids prepare, Steven is going to record sections of our textbook and vocabulary onto tape so that each kid will have a copy that they can listen to at home.  And who's voice will the kids be practicing their pronounciation to?  Mine!  It's been a bit of a strange project, but kinda fun too.  I go in every morning into the playroom which has been turned into a mini pseudo recording studio.  I sit at this chair in front of a mic and clearly, with my best dictation voice, record chunks of the text book.    It feels a little strange to do it, because I have to record like half hour chunks all in one single sequence at a consistent pace - no coughing, no yawning, no errors allowed.  I hate hearing how I sound on the tape, but doesn't everyone hate the sound of thier recorded voice?  There was a few times during recording that I had to concentrate to keep myself from laughing, as some of the sentences are kinda funny.  Here's a few of my favourites that almost made me giggle:  "Let's go to the playground and play.  Do you want to play with sand?  Don't throw sand!"  (oh, playground drama...)  "I knew you could do it!  Where have you been hiding all these talents?" (who would actually say something like this?)  "Shame on you.  That wasn't good!  Go to your room.  You need some spanking!" (my personal favourite - it was hard to record this one in a normal voice cause I wanted to crack up!)  "Put on your pants.  Do you want me to button your shirt?  Change your underpanties!"  (this to me just sounds really dirty...I had to try real hard NOT to giggle during this one!)  I've adjusted my blog again...  Unknowingly I had set the comments feature so that only blog-writers could leave a comment.  I've since changed it so that now absolutely anyone can write a comment.  Sorry if there was any confusion!  Feel free to comment away to your heart's content now!  :-)  After work tonight I went over to Ailish's (the Irish girl I met last Friday who lives just up the street from me) to hang out and watch some TV.  It's so great to have a friend who lives so near to me.  Monday and Tuesday nights is GREAT television here - 1 episode of The OC and 3 episodes of Sex & The City, all back-to-back.  Wonderful!  All Western programming aired in Korea comes with Korean subtitles so that the Koreans can follow along too, and I've gotten so used to seeing subtitles on TV that I don't even notice them anymore.    However, while watching Sex & The City tonight, it got me thinking, do they translate everything *literally*?  S&TC is a pretty 'racy' show, especially by Korean standards which are MUCH MORE conservative than North American shows.  The Koreans are quite naive and sheltered when it comes to sex and sexuality in mass media, so watching a show like S&TC must either shock the hell out of them, or send them into a titillating frenzy!  Do all the little slang expressions and sexual innuendoes and dirty talk on S&TC really translate over into Korean?  Are there Korean equivalents to words like 'hummer', 'fling', 'one night stand', 'going down on me', and 'fuck buddy?'  Cause in just 3 episodes of S&TC all of those expressions came up at least once, among many others that most Koreans could consider either horrifying, scandalous, offensive, or just plain inappropriate for public television.  Yet the show is still aired...  I can only imagine how red the faces of the translators must be when they have to write up the subtitles to put them on screen with each episode of that show!  Who knew that Sarah Jessica Parker and company would unknowingly become 'sexual educators' in Korea?  haha!  :-)

      So as I'm sure you've noticed by now, my blog has a whole new look!  The website I used to publish my blogs revamped itself, and came out with some new cool templates and features that I could add to my blog.  Besides looking snazzier and sexier than ever, there's a few new things on my blog for you to check out.  There's a profile with a bunch of info on me, soon-to-be-coming photograph of yours truly, and you can now leave comments to all my entry!    The comments feature is especially noteworthy.  It allows you to leave little remarks, suggestions, thoughts, feelings, questions, etc. regarding each specific entry up on the blog website for me, and everyone else, to view.  I'm hoping that you'll use it actively, and since many of you suck at emailing, hopefully I'll hear from a few of you more often via the comments sections.  Don't be shy - comment away, no inhibitions, no holds barred, no restrictions!  As Dishwalla says, 'tell me all your thoughts...cause I'd really like to know 'em!'  I've been in such good spirits lately!  Everything at school seems to be working out (so far), my computer is completely fixed, I've made new friends in my neighbourhood, just had one of the best weekends of my life, and now have a pretty snazzy and sexy blog to show off to the world!  What more could a guy ask for?  :-)

      We woke up at the not-so bright and VERY EARLY time of 4:30am this Sunday morning, the time when the Buddhist monks wake up every morning.  There was no time for showers (and not sufficient facilities for all us anyways!) and we were bussed back to the main temple for early morning meditation.  The monks meditate every morning at 5am, who believe that this time of the day is the most calm and quiet and peaceful and therefore the best time for praying to Buddha.   We rejoined the girls in the main temple and were all given small mats and began the meditation ceremony.  The monks led us through their morning ritual, which involves breathing exercises and deep concentration to be able to release all your sufferings and offer yourself to the paradise of Buddha.  The ceremony, in total, was about an hour and a half long, and was sooooo relaxing and calming and very spiritual, even for non-Buddhists.  Buddhists believe that there are 108 different kinds of suffering in life, and so every morning you have to bow and kneel before Buddha 108 times so that you can release each of those pains.  This would certainly take a while...but we were all willing to give it a go and be 'at one' with Buddha and the temple monks.  We all had to do 54, as the Master Monk thought that was enough for us...hehe.  (still standing up and kneeling down again 54 times is quite a lot!)  After the meditation we were lead outside (into the pouring rain, but none of us cared) to join the monks for morning exercise.  This consists of about 15-20 minutes of stretching, breathing, and jumping to 'wake up the body' and release all your pains.  It was beautiful, and again with the lush green settings and the rains and mist, you couldn't have asked for a more enchanting atmosphere or more inspiring setting!  It was breakfast after this, which was several vegetarian dishes served with this oatmeal that most of us did not enjoy very much.  It's unsweetened and definitely has a flavour that one has to acquire, but it was part of the experience anyways!  We then had about 2 hours or so for free time, so all of us used the time to wander around the temple complex, take some photos, and just soak up the Buddhist atmosphere.  I wish you could have been there to see and experience it for yourself because words and pictures could never do it justice!  After this it was time to say goodbye to the kind, gentle, and hospitable monks, and the beautiful Daewon-sa Temple, and get back on the bus.  We drove over to some green tea plantations near where the festival was so that we could wander through the green tea plants.  I was just expecting some farmer's field full of bushes, but it was completely different!  The plantations are built as this STEEP green terraces that rise up the slopes of the hills (kinda like what the Incas used to build in the Andes!)  The terraces rise soooo far up the hills, you can't even see the top of them, especially with all the mist.  We got to wander through the tea fields and the terraces, and climbed up all over the hills exploring the lush green paradise.  It was breathtakingly beautiful, even though it was crowded with Korean tourists, and we got some great shots of the terraces!  I could've easily wandered through the green tea terraces all day, but we had to get back on the bus after less than an hour.  We had lunch in Boseon, where a whole restaurant was reserved just for us.  The locals seemed so excited to have foreigners visiting, and even the town mayor came out to meet us and welcome us to his town!  We enjoyed our lunch and then it was time to leave.  We drove an hour and a half to the city of Mokpo to catch our train back to Seoul.  We were all tired and wet and dirty, but no one wanted to go home.  Our weekend was so incredibly amazing that each and every one of us were moved and touched by this incredible cultural experience.  We hopped back on the KTX and sailed north across Korea back to Seoul.  The scenery was beautiful again, green misty hills and lush rich farmland dotted by small towns and cities.  Travelling by train, I've always believed, is the most romantic way to see a country, and I couldn't have asked for a more comfortable or picturesque journey.    We arrived back in Seoul, and had some dinner at Bennigan's.  We were all craving Western food after our vegetarian, simple meal weekend, so we all ordered giant meals and gorged on the meat and carbs!  Oh, us Westerners are so gluttonous!  :-)  The gang decided to play a little joke on me, and (without telling me) told the servers that it was my birthday (even though it's actually in August!)  Half way through our meal a crew of Bennigan's servers suddenly showed up at the table with a giant green leprechaun hat for me to wear, and proceeded to sing a Korean birthday song and take our picture!  So hilarious!!!  At the end of the meal I was presented with a birthday card with our picture, and the whole gang signed me 'birthday wishes' in my card.  Too funny!  After dinner we wandered around Kyobo books for a while, and then headed on home.  This weekend was one of the best of my life, and was certainly an experience that I'll never forget as long as I live.  I feel so blessed and so lucky to have had such an opportunity to experience something so inspiring and so beautiful!  I'm so thankful that I came to Korea - I would have never experienced anything like this back home in Canada.  I've only been in Korea three months but I feel like I've seen and done and experienced SO MUCH already!  My eyes have truly been opened to the wonders that can be found outside Western lands and culture, and feel like my 'world vision has been expanded' so much.  In many ways I've learned more about the world and about life and other cultures in just three months than what I ever learned in my 5 years at university, or my 25 years of life in Canada.  To be able to explore and discover all of this has been truly amazing, and I'm not ever going to take it for granted!

      This weekend was definitely my best weekend yet here in Korea, (yes I know I say that often!) and one of the best Ii've ever had in my life.  Absolutely completely amazing...  Me and the gang had signed up for a package weekend tour down to the SW corner of Korea for an incredible cultural tour.  I woke up at 6:30am, was thankful there was no red-wine headache from last night's dinner party, and rode the train to Seoul Station to meet up with my friends and the tour at 9am.  This was going to be my first real train trip in Korea (and only the second ever in my life) and I was completely stoked!  We had a big gang out for this one - myself, Brad, Andrea, Steve, Amy, Emilie, Meighan, Jess, Kim and Jeremy.  We met up with our tour (about 40 ppl in total) at the ginormous post-modern KTX terminal at Seoul Station and boarded the KTX high-speed train to Gwang-ju.  The KTX is Korea's most ambitious engineering project to date, with the goal of installing high-speed bullet trains across the entire country.  Phase 1 alone cost $1.5 billion CDN, and just opened in April.  The train was ultra-modern and bright and clean and so comfortable.  Soon we were out of the city and sailing smoothly thru green picturesque countryside.  The only thing that was disappointing was that although the train *was* fast, it did not travel at it's full speed capacity.  The trains have a full speed capacity of 300 km/hr, but until the entire project is finished, they only travel about half that speed.  Still pretty speedy though!  We arrived in Gwang-ju in early afternoon and took a bus to Boseong where we got to check out the Green Tea Festival that this small city hosts every year.  This province of Korea is known internationally for its very high quality of tea, and so this festival aims to promote the local products.  We got to wander through the festival and watch the tea being prepared from leaves, and even got to engage in some hands-on tea leaf sorting and drying - was quite fun actually!  Later on there was tea samples of the many many varieties of green tea, and as the token foreigners at the festival we got first pick at everything.  We were honoured with a green tea ceremony where these older women who basically dedicate their whole lives to growing and preparing green tea served us some delicious tea in this elaborate, beautiful ceremony.  It was so graceful and elegant and the preparation for serving takes a good 10-15 minutes with every single move being an art form in itself.  Wow!  After trying the tea we checked out the rest of the festival, which sells an endless variety of products made from green tea - candy, clothing and linens, make-up and facial-cream, even meat and vegetables and other foods soaked or prepared with green tea.  One corner of the festival was a pottery area where pots and cups were made my hand on one of those crazy spinning clay machines, using mud and clay with green tea in it.  Well this was another hands-on exhibit that people could try out and they wanted a foreigner to demonstrate how it all worked.  Everyone else was too shy to get up in front of the small crowd and try it, so I volunteered myself!    It was so much fun, but also SO MUCH harder than it looks!  You have to spin the wheel with your foot, and it takes a lot of energy and rhythm just to keep the wheel spinning consistently at a fast-enough speed.  So while kicking the wheel every 2 seconds you have to concentrate on molding the wet clay with your hands, up into this blob-shape that (in theory) eventually becomes a cup or bowl.  Well I started off alright and everyone was all impressesd as my blob started to form a bowl-shape, but that's when disaster struck and suddenly without warning a hole burst through my clay and the whole thing fell apart back into one messy blog right before my very eyes.  IT'S SO TRICKY (and messy)!!!  It was really funny though and I was the 'star' for being brave enough to give it a go.  It's definitely an art form that takes a lot of skill and practice!  After the festival we got back on the bus and drove to where we would be spending the night - at a small but beautiful Buddhist temple high up in the remote hills near Boseong.  The temple was incredible - its architecture was simple yet stunningly beautiful, and you couldn't ask for a more breathtaking setting - surrounded by lush, green, misty hills.  It was a rainy weekend and with the temple and the mists the whole temple complex had a very 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' feel to it.  Mystical and magical.  We had dinner at the temple (in the 'eating building') which was a vegetarian Buddhist meal prepared for us by the monks.  It was actually very delicious, with lots of familiar Korean dishes, and some new ones as well.  After dinner we went down to the Tibetan Museum which the monks have assembled over the years, just next to the temple. It was a small but amazing museum full of hundreds of pieces of Buddhist relics - pottery and scriptures and paintings and blankets and sculptures and figurines and of course many little Buddha statues.  What was especially great was that our visit to the temple coincided with the visit of this famous Tibetan monk!  He led us through the museum and described everything to us, and explained a bit about Buddhist beliefs and philosophies, and about the current suffering and margilization of Tibetans.  Buddhism is banned and criminalized in Tibet, which has been occupied forcefully by China since 1953.  Very sad, indeed, as the Tibetans are probably the most peaceful and friendly people on the planet.  After the tour through the museum we were rewarded with a live Pansori performance - a very old, traditional style of Korean music, using vocals, drums, and story-telling.  Completely enchanting!  At this point it was getting close to 10pm which is bed time at the temple.  The boys and girls on our tour had to sleep separately, so the girls went to bed in the building where we had dinner, and us boys got shipped off on the bus to a 'male hermitage' located just down the road.  The hermitage was a simple building partioned off into 4 rooms.  For sleeping, we were given a few matts and pillows and we slept on the heated floors, totally Buddhist style.  It wasn't the most comfortable sleep, but with the warmth coming from the floor below, to the sound of the rain falling outside, to just knowing that I was in the middle of these beautiful forested hills in rural Korea in Asia, it was peaceful and inspiring.  How lucky am I for being able to experience something so different and so beautiful!!!

      So today was my first day of teaching the new textbook to my elementary kids, and it went over really well.  The textbook has been designed so that lessons are both educational and entertaining.  It's bright and colourful with fun characters, there's a tape with words, music, and sound effects to listen to, and it offers tons of suggested side-lessons and games.  The kids seemed to enjoy it quite a bit, and it'll certainly make my job easier.  Right on!  I had no plans for this Friday evening so I decided to head into Seoul for some dinner and some reading time at my favourite Starbucks.  However, plans soon changed...  I was walking to the bus stop when what do I see across the street from me...?  Could it be a....*caucasian woman???*  OH MY GOD!  Is she really real?  Is she a mirage?  I *NEVER* see foreigners in my neighbourhood!  I crossed the street and immediately went up to her and introduced myself.  Her name is Ann, she's from Quebec, is an English Teacher also, and lives just 10 minutes up the road from me!  Wow!  How could I have not run into her until now?  (Although I do think she may have been the 'girl in the dark mist' that I saw one night on the street way back in my first few weeks here.)  She was super-friendly, and we chatted up for like a good 10-15 minutes about life in Korea and our experiences so far.  She was meeting another girl for some shopping and then dinner in a few minutes, who sure enough turned up a second later.  The second girl's name is Ailish, she's from Ireland, is also an English Teacher, and lives *just up the street from me!!!*  What the...???  Where have these girls been???  I was so excited to meet foreigners who not only live in my neighbourhood, but are nice, friendly, and *NORMAL!*  ;-)  Anyways Ailish was hosting a little dinner birthday party at her place later on and invited me to join them.  So cool!  To hell with going to Seoul tonight, I'm gonna hang out with these girls instead!  I was still absolutely starving so I needed to eat before the 9:30pm dinner party.  The 3 of us rode the bus to Bucheon where Ann and Ailish went off to buy some groceries and I went and had some Mickey-D's for dinner.  I did some running around, then went home and packed my bags for the weekend knowing that if I was going out with these girls I might not be getting home until late...  I went over to Ailish's place around 10pmish and was again pleasantly surprised to see that she lives just 5-10 minutes up the road from me.  Not long after arriving at Ailish's, the rest of the girls showed up - Erin (from Ontario), Mindy (from Cape Breton Island), Bernie (from Ireland also) and the birthday girl Hannah (also from Cape Breton.)  So it was me, six girls, and several bottles of wine - good times!  All the girls were outgoing and lively and friendly, and I had such a great time hanging out with them.  This is the most female company I've had since arriving and it was really cool to be 'in on the girl talk' with this boisterous crew.  The wine and laughter were flowing, and I was even invited to a dinner party at Hannah's next weekend.  God how cool would it be to have cool girl friends who live in the same part of town as me???  Around 1am or so the girls decided to head out to a bar in Incheon, but knowing that I had to get up super early the next morning, and already having 6-7+ glasses of wine, I decided it was best for me to head home.  I bid adieu to my new friends and went home, to bed.  What a wonderful totally un-planned surprise tonight was!

      Another slack day today!  I only taught  three elementary classes which, at the moment, are all that I'm responsible for.  I start at 1:50pm and I'm finished at 5:20pm, and that includes a one-hour coffee break.  And yet I still get paid for a full day.  Man, this is sweet!  I actually feel kinda guilty for having such a short work-day.  Never in my life have I been paid so much to do so little!  It's only for this week though.  I found out what my work schedule avec the adult classes is going to be like and it's actually not all that bad.  Steven will be teaching the adult morning classes, and I will be teaching the evening ones - 3 classes from 7-10pm, each an hour long.  It's enough time to go home and have dinner before teaching the adults, and it's not all that late really.  (I still get home in time to watch re-runs of Sex & The City at 11pm!)  And plus I get to sleep in everyday.  I think I'll be able to handle this new schedule just fine.  I must admit that I am a little nervous to teach adults though.  With kids it's all fun and games and if you get stuck or there's time to kill you can BS your way until the end of the class.  Kids don't have any expectations really - they just want to have fun, and I'm good at that.  With adults it's different - they're serious, and they're smart, and they know if you're doing a good job or not.  They actually come in with real expectations, and I don't want to let them down.  I don't think I'm a bad teacher, not at all.  I just haven't taught students who are actually mature and reasonable and *wanting* to learn - it's all kinda scary!    New textbooks came in today that will be for the elementary students.  This new textbook actually has ORGANIZED lesson plans with suggested games and questions and even includes reviews and tests that can be given out.  I spent like 3 hours tonight reading the Teacher's Manual introduction section tonight - quite the in-depth textbook!  This will make teaching easier in some ways for me, but it'll also be an adjustment as I'm not used to working with a guided curriculam.  I've gotten so used to just doing 'improv' lessons after being just thrown in to classes with little or no material, that having organized, structured lessons seems so foreign!  Wow, so many changes these days!  But I think the changes will mean better education for the students, and with this new structure I think it'll make me a better teacher.  Wish me luck with the new curriculam, and with the new adult classes next week!

      Today was a great day, for many reasons!!!  First off, it was a holiday! (yep, another unusual random Korean National Holiday thrown into the middle of one of my work weeks - today it was Children's Day!)  My Korean friend James had phoned me earlier in the week and invited me to join him at SeoulLand, yet another amusement park in the Greater Seoul Area!  And it was a beautiful sunny day - perfect!  I met James at a subway station in between his place and mine and we made the great trek to SeoulLand, which can be found at Seoul Grand Park, nestled in the green hilly suburbs of southern Seoul.  I knew it was going to be a busy day - after my holiday experience at Everland a month ago, I had learned my lesson with amusement parks and holidays, yet here I was at another one!  We got off the subway station and it was just one looooong stream of screaming families in this mass exodus towards the gates of the park.  Wow!  Admission to this park proved to be cheaper, and I even got a 'foreigner's discount!' - how cool is that?  Man this rock star lifestyle is great!  SeoulLand was not as big in size as Everland, but it was really cool nonetheless.  Everland was very much a copycat of Disneyland, whereas SeoulLand was much smaller in scale and pretty much had just the rides (no zoo or flower gardens or parade or anything like that.)  It was crazy busy at the park - kids and parents running absolutely every which way, but it was a blast even with the crowds.  We checked out the Haunted House first (kinda lame, and we had to wait almost 45 mins. to get into it - not worth it!) and then checked out the giant swinging Viking ship.  While in line I was attracting the attention of a group of girls in line who kept yelling out 'you are sexy!' in both English and Korean to me.  "Why hello ladies, yes you may have my autograph, would you also like a photograph?" was my response.  Oh wait...no I'm not *that* much of an ass.....I just did what I always do when the flocks of Korean girls throw compliments and flirtations my way - smile, wave hello, and giggle nervously.  :-)  What am I going to do when I return to North America one day and NO ONE looks my way or makes a fuss?  I'm SO going to miss this Pseudo Celebrity Lifestyle...  *sigh*  ;-)  My moment of bravery came shortly after this.  I must confess that when it comes to amusement parks I'm a big wimp.  I'm too scared to go on anything that puts me upside down, and get sick on rides that spin too much.  SeoulLand has two massive, and I mean *MASSIVE* rollercoasters, containing various combinations of sky-high drops, corkscrews, and the dreaded back-to-back double loop-de-loop!  My stomach was just churning staring up at them....  Now when it comes to rides, I have no problem really with heights or with speed, it's being upside down that I ABSOLUTELY HATE!  Ever since my terrifying experience on Montezuma's Revenge at Knott's Berry Farm in LA when I was in Grade 6, I've been petrified of rollercoasters that go upside down.  You could put me on a coaster 100 stories tall and rocket me down to the Earth at Mach 6 and I'll laugh the whole time, but put me on a coaster that has one little corkscrew or loop-de-loop and I'll shit my pants...  I don't know what it is, but ever since that one scary experience I have yet to EVER set foot on a coaster that puts me upside down.  Yes I realize that was a long time ago, but still, I've been to many amusement parks since Knott's and I've refused each and every time going on anything that puts me upside down.  Or anything too spinny.  So there I was, staring up at this soaring monstrosity of a rollercoaster, watching hordes of Korean children and teenagers and frickin' grannies for Christ's sake ride the coaster, screaming out in joy the entire time.  It was at this pivotal moment that I found the strength inside...  I told myself that only the 'Old Scotty' would still be afraid to go on this upside down rollercoaster...the 'New Uber-Manly World Traveller Open To Any New Experience Laughs In The Face Of Fear Scotty' would ride the damn thing without batting an eyelash.  Oh the dilemmas....which side would win out?  I took a deep breath, gave myself a little pep talk (okay a really big one), and got in line...  I got on the first rollercoaster (the corkscrew one), buckled up....and.....ABSOLUTELY FUCKING LOVED IT!!!  I laughed the entire ride and yeah I screamed "OH MY GOD!!!" like a million times but it was the most fun I've had in...I can't even remember...  It was such a rush!  I got off that rollercoaster and felt like a million bucks.  I had shed my 14-year long fear of being upside down on a rollercoaster just like that.  And it all it took was one 2-minute ride on a damn rollercoaster in Seoul, Korea.  IT FELT AMAZING!!!  This may seem to be over-dramatic, I know what you're saying, "Scotty, it was *just* a silly rollercoater, get over yourself!", but it was a big deal for me.  (Barbie you'd be so proud of me!!  Not only did I not puke but I didn't have to sit down and lie on the grass for an hour like the last time you took me on a rollercoaster at PlayLand!)  After that I was on such a high that James and I made a b-line for the second, even more scarier rollercoaster - the one with the two loops.  And guess what?  I loved that one too!  I felt so alive, so excited, and so damn proud of myself!  Hooray for me!  :-)  We checked out a few more rides in the park (including spending an ungodly long hour and a half waiting to get on the log ride) and stayed almost until the park closed.  (No, I didn't go on anything especially spinny, I figured I can conquer my fear of being upside down, but no amount of pep talks is going to prevent my weak stomach from wanting to ralph anytime I'm on a spinny ride.  Whatever, one mission at a time, folks.)  We had some dinner and then it was time to go home.  SUCH A FUN AFTERNOON!!!!  On the way home, two different Koreans, on two different trains, came up to speak with me, say hello in English, and ask how I was enjoying my time in Korea.  Man, Koreans are just so darn cute and friendly!!!  The other reason why today has been so great is because when I got home, I had a normal, healthy, fully-operational computer waiting for me in my bedroom!!! While I had been away all day at SeoulLand Steven took it in to get repaired.  I was honestly expecting the computer to be gone like a week, but it was gone and back already all in the time I was out of the house.  What a great surprise!!  My computer is now completely virus-free and I'm thrilled to have my at-home online privileges back.  Life is grand!

      I've noticed a really significant difference between how Korean and Western kids learn and study at school recently.  My Korean students are all exceptionally talented at memorizing things, whether that be words, or sentence patterns, or numbers and formulas, but when it comes to anything creative, it's a whole different reaction.....  If it's basic memorization or reiteration or repeating what I say or a straight forward question and answer, they excel at it.  But anything that involves a question with an open answer, or having to create or imagine something, their reactions range from downright confusion to near panic.  The other day I gave out an assignment to some of my younger kids that involved creating a picture - any picture - out of 3 basic shapes, that would later be coloured and cut up into a puzzle that they could play with later on.  It was extremely simple and because it was a lesson in creativity, there really was no wrong way to do it.  However, I had to explain it to the kids over and over that they could draw anything they chose.  Their puzzled faces kept asking "ANYTHING???  I don't understand, Scott-Teacher..."  It wasn't the word 'anything' that was confusing them - I tried to explain it a number of ways, but it was rather the concept of having complete freedom to draw up whatever they liked that seemed to leave them stunned.    After a few minutes of conversing amongst each other, most of the class seemed to understand the assignment and went right to it.  But several of them just couldn't grasp the concept.  They kept waiting for me to give them something specific to draw or create, but I didn't, as that would defeat the whole purpose of the lesson.  I started to draw my own puzzle, and a few of the confused students started to draw *EXACTLY* what I was drawing in my creative puzzle onto their own sheets!  When I told them not to do that, to instead create a picture of their own, I was again met with blank stares.  One of the boys was so confused and upset that he actually started to cry and even after being consoled refused to try the assignment again.    This isn't the first time something similar to this has taken place in the classroom.  It seems that the Korean students are taught almost to be like robots, or just 'mere receptors of information' that they can dispense back at any teacher's will.  Sometimes I wonder if my kids really *understand* any of the English that I'm teaching, or if they're all just simply memorizing it.  There is a huge difference between actual understanding, and mere memorization, and my Korean kids have really illustrated this.  In Western schools, creative thought is given a high priority and we're taught from an early age to explore this aspect of learning.  Maybe it's something that's lacking, or missing altogether in the Korean education system?  I wonder if it's a Korean thing, or an Asian thing?  I'd be curious to hear about other people's experiences with ESL and how the concept of creativity went over in their classroom....

      So Monday has arrived - the first day of the new changes at work.  I didn't have to be at work until 1:30pm today as all my morning classes are nonexistent now that the kindergartens are gone.  I walked into work and it was so eerie - dead silent and completely lacking in activity and movement.  I'm used to arriving at school and hearing the screams and laughter of all the children, and seeing them running around each and every which-way, and always having a couple of them greeting me at the door with a hug.  None of that today....  It was such a slack day at work today!  No morning classes (as the early AM adult classes were taught by Steven - they better stay that way!) and then this afternoon I found out that 2 of my elementary classes have been merged into one as our kids numbers are so small.  So, in the end, I only had 3 classes to teach today (instead of the usual 7!)  If there are evening adult classes I haven't heard anything about them yet as I was dismissed at 5:10 today.  Man what a short day!!  I'm still playing it cautious at work, and Steven wants to discuss a new timetable regarding all the changes tomorrow I think, but I'm keeping a positive attitude with all of this.  I really do believe that it's going to work out and that none of the worst-case scenarios will have to play out.  Even if the proverbial shit does hit the metaphorical fan, I know I'll be alright.  It's not worth getting all stressed out over!  Two things happened on Friday that reminded me about what's really important in life, and have helped me to regain my perspective regarding all of these changes, the first one being small and amusing, the second being quite major and serious.  I was walking back to work from the bank on Friday afternoon, after doing my monthly bank transfer back to Canada (payday did come thru - yah!) and was just walking oh-so casually down the street when I heard this 'plop' and looked down at my shoes....  On my left toes, spread all across my nice black dress shoes, was a big pile of white oozing gooey bird shit, freshly fallen on my helpless footwear.  At first I was pissed off about this as it was disgusting and I'd have to clean off my shoe when I got back to work, but then I realized that it could have been much worse...  Had I been only  one second faster  in my travels back from the bank that bird shit would've landed on my head or shoulders instead - MUCH WORSE THAN LANDING ON MY SHOE!!!  The lesson I learned from this is that even though I had had another crappy week at work and have been all stressed out lately, things can *ALWAYS* get shittier!!  (literally and figurately, so be thankful they aren't!)  The second change to my perspective occurred Friday night.  I was online on Messenger (the only thing that works on my computer these days, and even then it's hit and miss...) and my friend Jason who lives in Seattle came online. I was talking to him and he had some really horrible, sad news to tell me.  The Sunday before his father had had a heart attack, and was in the hospital in a coma because of it.  Apparently his brain had been without oxygen for nearly 10 minutes (3 minutes without oxygen is enough to cause serious brain damage) and the doctors were fairly certain that even if he ever did regain consciousness, his father would probably be a vegetable, at best.  Jason, by some prior agreement, had been placed with the responsibility of deciding when and if the doctors should take his father off of life support.    After waiting nearly a week and seeing no sign of recovery, Jason told me that this coming weekend (the one that just passed) he was probably going to decide to take his father off of life support.  Each passing day meant less and less hope, and what kind of life would his father lead even if he did ever come out of the coma?  I don't even know Jason very well but this made me feel terribly sad.  I can't imagine being in a position like that, having to decide the fate of my father's life (or anyone close to me, for that matter.)  To bear that weight would be so much - I don't think I'd have the strength to decide to 'pull the plug' on a loved one, even knowing that it's for the best.  That decision would haunt me for the rest of my life.  I really feel for Jason, and have no idea what he's decided to do as I haven't spoken to him since Friday night.  I wish him and his family all the best and will hope for strength and peace for them.  This event really brought things into focus for me.  Even if my job does turn shitty, it's not all that bad in the big picture of life.  Having crappy hours at work is nothing in comparison to having to decide to take my father off of life support.  Perspective really is *everything* in life.  One could make such drama and stress from the smallest of things but that's no way to live.  At the end of the day I still have my health, have my family and friends alive and happy and healthy, and still have more opportunities and choices in life than I'll ever know what to do with.    A reality check is a good thing, methinks.

      Brad and I ended up sleeping in pretty late today and were surprised to discover that Steve and Andrea were already in Seoul by the time we got out of bed!  It didn't matter so much to me, I had my own plans for this afternoon anyway.  I was meeting up for the first time (in Korea) with this guy I know from Vancouver, Steven.  Steven is 23 and a family friend of my old boss at Delany's back in BC and had just arrived in Korea 2 weeks ago to begin his year of teaching.  I phoned Steven and we made plans to meet up in the city.  It was really cool to hang out with Steven today!  Not only because he's a cool guy and fun to be with, but also cause for the first time since I've been here in Korea, I get to be the guide and lead someone around.  I'm no longer The New Guy!  I can hand that title over to Steven and it feels good to be a bit of a 'resident expert' even though I've only been here just under 3 months.    Steven and I went and toured Gonjeongjong Palace (where I was with Steve back in March) and it was still as beatiful and splendorous as the first time I laid eyes on it.  The ancient palaces in Korea really don't ever become dull or boring - they're amazing each and every time you see them - no matter how often you go.  Steven was blown away with the detail and majesty of Gonjeongjong and we spent a couple hours just wandering through the grounds of the sprawling palace complex.    After the palace we were absolutely starved so we went out for dinner.  I took him through Insadong on the way and he really liked the street (it always impressed the tourists - hehe!)  It was as busy as it always is down there in Insadong even though it was a bit rainy today.  We went to TGI Fridays and had an awesome dinner - chicken fajitas for me!  The bathrooms at TGI Fridays are certainly noteworthy - each of the stalls have a mini TV screen at the back of the door so you can watch clips of music videos and advertising while sitting on the can!  Cool!  He wanted to know a good place to buy English books so after dinner I took him to Kyobo up the street.  And then after the bookshop we went to Starbucks to sit and relax and rest for a while.  I was feeling pretty beat as I've done a lot of walking around done this weekend all over Seoul!  He had to get up early the next day so we hopped on the subway and it was off home.  He lives on the same side of the river as I do, but off a different line.  Another great weekend comes to an end!

      I slept in today (my is it nice to just be able to wake up when you want and then just lie in bed doing absolutely nothing until getting up only when you damn well feel like it - paradise!)  I was meeting up with Michael today and some of his friends to 'do something cultural' in the city today.  I got dressed, packed up my usual 'weekend bag' and headed into the city.  It was really hot outside today and I was sweating buckets in the long-sleeved shirt I was wearing.  Not a wise outfit choice this morning, Mr.Erdman!  I changed into a t-shirt when I got to Michael's place in Itaewon.  His friend Maeve and some friend of hers were supposed to meet up with us today but the girls were too hung over from a night of partying the night before so they bailed.  Michael and I decided to grab some lunch at Subway and sort out plans for the day.  A 9-day city-wide festival just began today called 'Hi Seoul!' and so we thought we'd go and check out and see what was going on down a City Hall today which is where most of the events were supposed to start.  We ended up getting on the wrong bus so we were taken a bit far from City Hall, but since it was such a beautiful day we decided just to walk the distance anyways. We passed through this really cool area of the city called Yongdong (sp?) which is a shopping mecca in the city.  The streets were absolutely packed with people - SUPER CROWDED - and every second person had these giant 32 cm. ice cream cones - (yes, they are actually 32 cm. tall - they measure them for you when you buy them from these stands - it's a lot of ice cream, believe you me!)  It's street scenes like this that epitomize, to me, The Asian Experience' - narrow streets and alleys, thousands of people, lots of stores and colourful signage, hot temperatures, and just a general electricity in the air that I've just never felt on any other continent.  Exotic and pulsating.  I wish I could capture random moments like this and somehow mail that experience to all my friends and family back home.  When we got to City Hall, the Hi Seoul activities of the day were a bit of a letdown.  They had just unveiled a new plaza in front of City Hall that was opened that morning and *everybody* had crammed into it to claim a piece of grass for their own.  Open sections of green grass are *extremely rare* to find in the city so all the Koreans just seemed mesmerized with this new island of green lusciousness in the middle of the hustle and bustle of downtown Seoul.  There was a free public concert going to be happening in the plaza that evening, but that was still several hours off and we didn't feel like hanging out in the crowded plaza.  (I guess we're spoiled, us North Americans, as an open patch of green grass doesn't seem to excite us the way it does the Koreans - lol!)  It seems that most of the real big events for Hi Seoul actually take place *next* weekend....  Michael and I decided instead just to walk up the street to fetch a coffee and hang out somewhere less crowded.  We went to the Starbucks near Kyobo Bookshop and Sejong Centre (a giant concert hall) and were pleased to discover an outdoor photography exhibit put on display by the National Geographic Society.  It was entitled Around The World In 80 Days and it featured dozens and dozens of *spectacular* photographs of landscapes and people from all over the world.  So beautiful!  We took our time enjoying the outdoor exhibit and then parked ourselves on the giant steps of Sejong Centre to just sit and enjoy the lively street scenes.    Michael's friends Eric, Austin, and Tim (all guys I've met before at the clubs I've gone to with Michael) showed up and so all 5 of us went and saw another free art exhibit just inside the Centre.  Browsing thru art displays with a giant caramel frappuccino on a hot humid day is a great way to spend a Saturday!  It was evening by then so I said my goodbyes to the boys and went and met up with Brad, Andrea, Steve, and Kelsey.  We took the bus back to Ilsan and went and had a fabulous dinner at this French restaurant called Hippo.  (a weird name, if you ask me!)  It's a restaurant chain from Paris and had quite a unique menu with North American and (French?) menu items.  We all spent a good 2.5 hours just enjoying our dinner and having great philosophical conversations.   A really relaxing, enjoyable meal.  I was excited to see creme brulee on the dessert menu (something I thought I'd NEVER see in Korea) and so I ordered that for dessert.  It was alright I guess - nowhere near as good as the culinary orgasm of a creme brulee that my friend Benoit can cook up.  *sigh* You've spoiled me Ben - will any other creme brulee ever compare to yours?  (I think not!)  After dinner we went back to Brad's, watched Monty Python & The Quest For the Holy Grail (absolutely hilarious!!!  I've never seen any Monty Python films before!) and then went to sleep.

      The first thing I did today when I woke up was phone Poly and update them as to what was going on.  Surely they must have some suggestions to help me get out of this horrible situation...  There's gotta be a loophole I can escape through somehow, or a way that we can negotiate with that psycho Steven.    Unfortunately, they said there was nothing really that they could do.  It wasn't their place to get in the middle of this, and they weren't going to pay him off.  They suggested that I phone Steven back and try and do some bargaining - perhaps there was something else that I could exchange with him, or maybe I could talk him back to sanity.  So there I was, with having sole responsbility to deal with that mother fucking bastard who was screwing me over.  I was actually feeling pretty level-headed and calm today, but suddenly this wave of anger - productive anger - went through me and I felt the strength and confidence to take Steven head on.  If he wanted to play this stupid game, the only way I was going to win, or at least avoid getting deported, was to play along with him.    And really, who the hell did he think he was?  Does he not realize what he's messing with here?  This is the fucking S2H World Tour!!!  AND NOBODY FUCKS WITH THE S2H WORLD TOUR!!!  This is my project, this is my life, this is my dream that I've worked so hard to achieve, and had really only just begun.  I wasn't going to let one greedy mother fucking bastard change all that by trying to screw me over and send me home.  Uh-uh - I'm staying here in Korea, and that's all there is to it!  I knew that sacrifices would have to be made, and I was the only one who could give them up.  I had to make a deal with the devil, and so I did.  I phoned up Steven, and in my calmest, friendliest voice, offered him a deal in a polite and warm tone (while gritting my teeth and plotting his death silently...)  I offered that if he gave me my letter of release, then he would not have to pay me my wages for those last 3 weeks of work that he still owed me.  He said he'd think about it and get back to me...  Less than an hour later he phoned me back, and had agreed.  I'd get the letter from him, and in return he wouldn't have to pay me the 1.5 million Won he still owed me.  It was a huge price to pay (about $1500 CDN) but it was the only thing that I could offer him.  And in reality, I'd probably have never seen that money anyways.  He'd probably drag out the process of paying me that money long after I had started the new job, and in the end I'd most likely never seen a penny of it.  It was a bitter, jagged pill to swallow, but what other choice did I have?  He had me held over a barrel and he knew it - I had to offer him substantial enough bait for him to bite, and thank god he did.  Still, I was so angry, so bitter, so fuming with rage...why would he do this to me???  I phoned my parents to give them the update on what had happened in the last 24 hours, and they were as shocked as I was.  Not long after I got off the phone with them I went to make another phone call, only to discover that my phone had been cut off... WHAT THE FUCK, NOW???  Either Steven had decided to cut it off cause he's pissed or it's just a strange coincidence that it would suddenly, 'randomly' stop working today.  On top of that, my cell phone had been cut off too.  I now had no way of talking to anyone outside my house!!!  Thank God I still had the internet!!  The bastard may have cut off my main lifeline, but I wasn't dead in the water yet.  I decided that when Steven gave me the letter that evening, that was it, I was going to leave right away!!  I wasn't going to wait until tomorrow to move - I wanted to get out now.  Steven had originally offered to help me move, but had since decided that he was 'too busy' to help me anymore.  I didn't care about this, cause to be honest I didn't want the motherfucker knowing where my new home was going to be.  I wanted to run away, to escape from his clutches, to turn my back on that hellhole and never look back.  And I wanted to be safe knowing that he'd never be able to find me or cause me more frustrations.  I emailed my friend Michael and BEGGED him to come pick me up that evening when he got off of work and drive me and all my stuff to Ilsan.  I wasn't getting my keys to my new place until tomorrow, but I'd just crash at Steve's instead.  I totally felt like a refugee!!!  It was like I was living in a country when war broke out all of a sudden, and I couldn't escape cause they had closed the borders and my passport was in the hands of the evil totalitarian Nazi officer.  I wanted to flee to a safe country, to the refugee camp waiting for me on the other side, but had no way to get to it.  I had to get that 'passport' (the letter) and get the hell out any way I could.  I would flee in the middle of the night with all of my belongings and run away to a safe place.  I was the refugee, Shihung was the war-torn country, Steven was the Nazi, and Ilsan was my oasis salvation.    I spent all day packing up my belongings and downloading all my precious photos of friends and family that I had on the computer onto disk or my splashbulb site.  I couldn't leave anything behind cause once I left I knew I was never coming back.  And I wanted to remove all evidence that had I lived there.  Luckily I don't own a lot of stuff here so it didn't take long for me to get all my shit together.  At around 7pm Steven came home and I went up to exchange my deal with the devil.  I was terrified that he had changed his mind, or that he'd want more from me, or that he would find a way to try and milk more out of me.  Surprisingly, he was friendly, calm, and polite when I met up with him.  He had the letter already written out and handed it over, and then I had to sign a piece of paper agreeing that he didn't have to pay me the wages.  And that was it - clean and simple and easy - but I was trembling inside.  I kept expecting something else to go wrong, for that demon to rear his ugly head from inside Steven again.  But strangely enough, as soon as we did the deal, he was back to his normal, friendly self.  He had switched back to his old personality again, and was acting all chummy with me, as if he hadn't just fucked me over with his greed.  He was apologetic again for having to let me go in the first place, and wished me well at the new school.  He even offered to help me in the future if I ever needed it (like I'm ever going to contact you again, you motherfucker!!) and said that maybe he would help me move after all.  He even suggested that maybe sometime him and the fam can come over to see my new place and have dinner in Ilsan together?  I was completely confused and disturbed...who was the real Steven?  Whatever.  I've got my letter, I'm getting the fuck out of here!  I informed him that I was moving that night (he was surpised) and he seemed sad to see me go.  I went back downstairs and waited for Michael to come rescue me.  That was a whole other ordeal in itself...  I've never had anyone come visit me in Shihung before, so I had no idea how to give directions to get there.  There are no landmarks in my part of town, almost nothing is in English, and most of the streets don't even have names...    Michael and Gary eventually found me, but it took almost 2 hours of lost driving and wandering through both Shihung and Bucheon to find me.  I have never ever been happier to see a friend as when I finally saw Michael in his car!!  We packed up all my stuff and I gave back my key.  Steven and the whole family came out to wave goodbye to me and I thought that Steven was going to cry.  ????????????????  See ya, goodbye, adios, I'm outta here.  Thanks for fucking me over.  Have a nice day.  Buh-bye!  ;-)  Getting to Ilsan proved to be a challenge in itself as well!  None of us had ever driven from Shihung to Ilsan (totally across the city from each other) and we didn't know which streets or highways to take.  It took forever, and we ended up doing this criss-cross journey across Greater Seoul, including getting stuck on the Airport Express Freeway which brought us all the way to Incheon Int'l cause there's NO OFF-RAMPS, and involved doing some serious back-tracking...  Finally we got to Ilsan, and I was amazed that I was able to find the apartment building in the dark.    By the time we got there it was after midnight and I was completely exhausted.  But I had made it to the other side, reached safety, and knew that the worst was now behind me.  You hear all these horror stories about teachers getting screwed in Korea, and now I've lived through one of those experiences myself.  It's horrible.  I don't ever want to get screwed over like that again.  But now I just want to move on and forget about it.  I've got a new life to begin, and I'm not going to let one bad experience ruin my whole adventure here in Korea.  The S2H World Tour is bigger than all of that, and it's not gonna get bogged down by one (although significant) bump in the road!  I was sooooooo tired and was happy to go to bed at Steve's.  I gave the biggest thank you hugs to Michael and Gary and said goodbye.  I had escaped, I had survived - and I was *exhausted.*  This refugee collapsed into bed and fell into a deep, deep sleep, happy that the day was over.

      Isn't it funny how life loves to throw you a massive, cruel curve-ball your way sometimes, just when everything is starting to go well?  You think you're in the clear, you think you've got both hands on the wheel of life and that you're in control, you think that it's nothing but smooth sailing in those waters ahead of you.  And then SHIT HITS THE FAN!  My, how quickly things can change from being so damn good to so completely, utterly, horribly bad.  I started off today thinking that I was on top of the world, that everything was falling into place, that I had nothing to worry about.  And then I had the rug pulled out from beneath me.  AND MAN DID I FALL HARD!  Here's how today went down...  Today's plan of action was to subway it from Ilsan to Shihung so that I could pick up my Letter of Release from my old boss Steven, and then subway it back again to Ilsan to deliver the letter to Poly.  This letter was absolutely crucial for me to get - my entire life in Korea depended on that letter.  The Letter of Release is what allows me to switch from one employer to another.  Basically, Steven has to write a letter that 'releases' me from his responsibility, and transfers that responsibility (via Immigration) to Poly who become my new sponsors.  Without it I can't get a new work visa with any school, and invariably have to go home to Canada as I can only remain unemployed in Korea for a very short period of time.  When I got into Shihung I phoned up Steven and asked if I could come down and pick up the letter.  His tone was less than friendly on the phone, and he said that he wanted to speak to my new director at Poly first.  I wasn't sure why, so I phoned Poly and told them to give Steven a call so that I could get my letter from him.  Well I waited and waited half the day for someone to phone me back and let me know what the hell was going on, but finally I had to phone Steven myself.  This is when Steven told me why he wasn't giving me the letter, and this is when my life completely fell apart around me...  Basically, Steven told me that unless Poly reimbursed him for my plane ticket to Korea, and paid him a fee of 500,000 Won, he would not give me the letter of release.  WHAT THE FUCK???  Why on Earth would POLY have to give Steven a bunch of money???  I don't get it!!!  Well according to Steven this was 'normal business practices' here in Korea, but it made absolutely no sense to me.  When I talked to Poly they said that this indeed was not a 'normal business practice' and that it was just Steven trying to get some money, using me as his bargaining chip.  And Poly wasn't going to cave in to his unrealistic, greedy demands.  Steven would not budge an inch at all, and no matter how much I begged and pleaded with him, he wasn't going to back down at all.  He wanted that money, and he wasn't going to give up my letter until he got it.  He knew that he was in a position of power, and he became so desperate and money-hungry that he was willing to fuck me over to get it.  Either Poly paid him, or Steven wouldn't give up the letter, meaning that I'd have to go back home to Canada.    Where the hell did all of this come from?  Where did this evil satanic side of Steven come from?  This is the same man who's family would make me dinner often, would take me on family trips to amusement parks, who wanted me to spend Christmas with his family at a ski resort, who was completely nice and caring to me since the day I arrived.  But he became blind with greed and seriously, it was like a whole other personality coming out.  I couldn't reason with him at all.  He kept insisting that this was 'not my problem' and that it was 'between the two directors', but he didn't seem to understand that I'M THE ONE WHO GETS FUCKED IF I DON'T GET THIS LETTER!!!  I'm the one who gets punished in the end, not the schools!!!!  Why the hell would he do this to me?  What did I ever do to deserve this from him???  It made absolutely no sense as to why Poly should pay him off.  They owed him nothing!!!  Steven brought me over to Korea with the promise that I'd be employed for a year.  He broke the promise, he let me go (with only 2 days notice, to boot), and now he wants my new school to pay HIM for HIS OWN MISTAKES???  It's not Poly's fault that Steven can't fucking run that school and is as broke as can be.  Why should the employer who's offering me salvation - a new job - from the conditions that HE PUT ME IN BY LETTING ME GO have to pay him off??  If anything, Steven should be thankful that I've found a job and that I'll be out of his apartment soon!!!  I just could not get my head wrapped around the whole thing.  After 45 minutes of getting nowhere on the phone, and both of us getting more and more angry and flustered and exasperated, I gave up for the night.  I got off the phone and practically had a nervous breakdown.  I phoned Ailish to vent all of this on her and almost started hyperventilating.  My entire future in Korea depended on that one stupid letter, and the one person who could give it to me had turned into a sadistic, greedy, money-hungry, low-life fucking piece of shit scumbag!!! What the hell was I going to do?  I didn't want to go back to Canada (I'm having too much fun in Korea, I like living and working here) and even if I flew to Vancouver and then back to Korea I still wouldn't be able to get a new VISA.  I had no hopes whatsoever for employment in Korea without that letter.  What was I to do?  I was completely and totally and utterly and royally F-U-C-K-E-D!!!  On top of all this, I had discovered something very unsettling in my apartment.  I had just sat down for dinner at my kitchen table when I looked over and noticed that there was something written on the table.  There, in blue pen, written right on top of the glass, someone had written:  You Kill  You Die Scott  WHAT THE FUCK WAS THIS!!!!!!!!?????????????????  Who the hell had written this?  And how the fuck did they get into my apartment?  AND WHY WOULD THEY WRITE THIS!!!???  Was this some sick joke, someone's idea of really bad humour, or was this a serious (death?) threat?  What did it mean????  Whoever had written this did it when I was staying at Steve's earlier in the week cause I had never seen it before.  The only person who has access to my apartment other than me is Steven.  Occasionally him or Susan will come into my apartment when I'm not home to clean it for me once in a while, but what the FUCK was this about???  To add to the confusion it wasn't even Steven's hand-writing...  It looked almost like a kid but not quite?  WHO WAS WRITING ME SICK MESSAGES ON MY FURNITURE WHEN I'M NOT HOME???    God, I really *REALLY* need to get out of this place...  I tried to clear my head and go through all the options but there didn't seem to be many.  How was I going to get out of this?  Steven wanted the money and wasn't going to back down, and Poly was refusing to pay him off.  It was a complete standstill, and I was caught in the middle.  I decided to try and get some sleep and talk to Poly again in the morning.  There has to be a way out of this hellhole...

      Today was my second day of class observations and it went much more smoothly for me today!  Even just after one day things are starting to become more familiar and it wasn't so overwhelming as yesterday was, when I had to learn *everything* from the start.  I seem to be bonding with the kids already and they all seem to like me.  I can't wait until I can start teaching the classes on my own for real instead of just sitting in and helping with them.  The pre-schoolers will be fun cause they're so adorable, and my older kids will be great because they continually surprise me with their level of English understanding.  Poly is a school that caters to two types of students - 'Returnee' kids, and 'Gifted and Talented' kids.  Returnee kids are students who have lived abroad in an English-speaking country for at least two years, so their English is obviously very advanced.  Gifted and Talented kids have not lived overseas, but just have natural aptitudes towards learning English and so are much better at English than the average Korean child.  This means that ALL my kids are *really smart* kids.  Smart enough that the material we're teaching at Poly is actually the material they teach kids (of the same age) in the Los Angeles School Board!!  My older kids continually astound me - most of them don't even have an accent and their English is actually...dare I say...BETTER than the average North American kid!  WOW!!!  Teaching them is going to be a really rewarding challenge as I'll have to raise the bar to keep them interested and still learning.  I also learned something really cool today - the apartment that I'm going to be moving into is actually BRAD'S OLD APARTMENT!!!  WOW!!!  This is awesome!  Brad had a really great apartment and obviously I'm more than familiar with it - now I get to move in and make it my own.  Steve lives just downstairs from Brad, and a bunch of my other coworkers live just around the corner.  We all live in 'The Village' which is a great little neighbourhood in Ilsan not too far from Poly.  I'm also going to be taking over Brad's old phone number, cell phone, and even his desk at work.  Hey, I'm like the New Brad!  ;-)  Today was an even longer day - classes went until 7:30pm - but it didn't seem as draining as yesterday was.  I feel like I'm 'getting into the flow' of things at school.  There's still lots to learn but I feel fully confident that I'm really going to enjoy teaching at Poly.  Wow - great school, cool co-workers, an awesome apartment in a really nice city - everything in my life feels like it's finally falling into place!  After work today Steve, Amy, Kelsey, and myself went and saw SHREK 2 at the movie theatre at LaFesta.  It was *absolutely hilarious* and I haven't laughed that much in a movie in forever it seems...  It's going to be so nice to have stuff like shopping malls and movie theatres in close proximity to where I'll be living!  ILSAN ROCKS!  ;-)  After the movie we all went back home and had another early night.  Us teachers really do need our beauty sleep after these busy days!

      I spent the night at Steve's last night so that I could go into Poly for my first day of class observations without having to commute 2 hours to get there.  I met up with Amy in the AM who also lives in 'The Village' and we cabbed it over to Poly.  My first day - I was so excited!!  :-)  Today was a crazy busy day - total information overload!!!  Schedules to learn, kids names to memorize, class material to read, stacks of textbooks to become familiar with, co-workers to meet, it was GO GO GO all day today!  The morning started with me sitting in on my pre-school class and they were great.  When I start working at Poly I'll have my own classroom with the same 12 kids for pre-school every day.  Jeanette is the teacher who's responsible for my class in the meantime so I just sat in and listened in on the lessons and helped with the activities.  The kids are so cute and completely adorable.  They're only 5 years old but have already learned quite a bit of English, enough to communicate the basic stuff anyways.  They're actually well-behaved and polite to each other, as well as the teachers.  They've been raised in an educational environment that has routine and consistency and it totally shows.  My old school was always chaotic and seemed to change everyday, there was never a routine or consistency - as a result my kids hardly listened to a word I would say and were all over the place.  Half my day is spent with the pre-school kids, and it's split into four blocks everyday - Phonics, Sharing Time, Library or Gym or Computers, and Activity.  Each block is 40 minutes long and the teachers are given a ten-minute break inbetween each block.  After the third block we're also given 45 minutes for lunch so it's a really well-organized, quick-moving morning.  My classroom comes equipped with all materials and supplies needed to teach - from scissors and crayons to music and paper.  And everyday I have prepared lessons for me to teach.  Each month the teachers are given a list of the English concepts/words/lessons that the kids are supposed to learn, and you're given total freedom to deliver it at the pace and manner that you wish.  It's the best of both worlds - an organized curriculam with the freedom to teach in your own style.  Wow!  The afternoons are a bit more confusing - there's six blocks to teach of elementary-aged kids, and they range from Grades 2 - 6.  I learned that I'm going to be one of Poly's Reading Teachers which is great.  All my lessons will be reading with the kids and helping them with vocabulary, pronunciation, and understanding the concepts presented in the books/reading materials.  I get to make up supplementary games and lessons to make this material more fun to learn, as well as being able to apply the subjects/words to other situations.  It sounds like fun - I can't wait.  I also get to teach Grade 2 Science twice a week which will be a blast!  These kids are so smart!!!  By the end of my day though, around 6:30pm, I was completely exhausted!  It's a busy day that flies by quickly but is certainly a very long one.  (This ain't the teach-for-three-hours-a-day-routine I was spoiled with in May at my old school!)  ;-)  But it actually feels like 'real teaching' and I'm excited for my second day of class observations.  When I got home I was so tired I fell asleep on Steve's bed while watching TV!  Steve came home a few hours later and we had some dinner together and then both had an early night.  Man, teaching can wear a guy out!  ;-)

      Today was the last day that Barbara and Ellie were in town so I wanted to hang out with them one last time and show them some more of Seoul.  I've only known the girls a short time but I feel like we've all become good buddies!  They're tons of fun and really nice people - I wish they lived here!  :-)  We met up around 1:30pm and took the subway into Seoul.  Our whole plan was to visit the Korean War Memorial but that was shot to hell when we arrived there.  I had totally forgotten that all museums and palaces are closed in Korea on Mondays!!  We arrived to see that the doors were locked - no museum tour today.  However, it wasn't a complete loss...  On one side of the ginormous museum is a large outdoor military display that's open even if the inside of the museum is not.  It's basically a yard full off many 'military leftovers' from the Korean War.  SO COOL!  We spent a good while checking out all the war machinery and it was fascinating to explore it and see it all up close.  They had giant bombers and transports and fighter planes, as well as tanks of every size, shape and colour.  They also had howitzers and missile launchers, and even a small submarine, all on display.  A lot of this kind of war machinery I've never seen before up close, and even though it's all from the 1950's and therefore pretty outdated, it was fascinating nonetheless.  It was definitely an example of how 'intelligent' man is, and all the creative ways that we invent to kill each other off.  Kinda sad really when you think about it.  So much money and resources go into these killing machines - what a waste!  It's depressing that we live in a world that still needs armies and military forces - or maybe it's just a world where we're *led to believe* that we need these armies and military forces?  Imagine what life would be like if the nations of the planet devoted as much of our time, money, and resources towards causes that actually IMPROVE human life, for all!  What a different world we'd be living in...  To be greedy and fearful and to kill is to be human?  After checking out the military stuff we decided to go and do some shopping (but a quick Starbucks break was needed first, of course!)  Because I'm starting a new job soon and don't have a lot of work clothes that are comfortable for summer, I decided to do a little shopping for myself, for once.  I bought a new pair of khakis and 3 new work shirts, as well as two fun T-shirts for myself - all at a really cool store called EigenPost (sounds German to me, not Korean!)  After I did my shopping the girls bought some more gifts for friends back at home in Insadong, and then it was time for dinner.  We went for our last meal together at TGI Friday's and had a great meal together.  After that it was time for us to separate - the girls were heading back to Shihung and I was heading out to Ilsan for the night because I had to be at Poly bright and early the next morning.  We said our goodbyes in the subway station and it was sad to see them go - I'm really gonna miss hanging out with them!    I went out to Steve's to spend the night and we stayed up late quizzing each other with trivia questions.  Our appearance on The Contenders has been confirmed for June 30 so we gotta get ready for that!  I can't wait to be on the show - it's gonna be a blast!

      After a nice long sleep, I showered up and took the train out to Ilsan.  Today was Amy's birthday and she was having an informal 'birthday lunch' at a restaurant in LaFesta with the whole gang.  I met everyone at Rosenbrau - a German/North American restaurant with the best buffet this side of the Pacific!  They had an aweseome spread of yummy food for a really cheap price and so we ate as much as we could! Mmm....  Our plan was to hit the soccer game going on tonight over at World Cup Stadium in Seoul, but we still had some time to kill before heading that way.  Most of the gang went home for a bit to change and relax, but four of us decided to hang out at LaFesta - myself, Amy, Steve, and Kelsey.  We then decided (well, my suggestion) to go to a board game cafe and play some Clue!  Everyone was keen on it so we went and had ourselves a round of some sweet Clue action and it was good times had by all!  Man, that game is addictive!  Steve won but we all agreed that a re-match was definitely needed soon!  (It's great fun to be a Clue Geek!)  ;-)  We all met up as a big group again and took the subway over to World Cup Stadium.  WCS is a *MASSIVE* stadium - one of 16 or so that were built for the World Cup that Korea and Japan co-hosted back in 2002.  It's a beautiful stadium whose roof in built in the shape of a traditional Korean kite, and I don't know the exact capacity, but believe me when I say that it would hold A LOT of people!!!  It was probably the biggest stadium I've ever seen in my life!  WOW!  The game itself wasn't all that exciting (final score, only 1-1) but it was still a fun evening anyways.  For about 17$ CDN we were only 5 rows up from the field, and a professional soccer game (aka: 'The World's Sport') is always fun to watch.  We all remarked on how well the players were all in shape, and how amazing it is when they kick the ball like half way across the field!!  And then they have a ball coming at their HEADS at 113 km/hr (yes they had a 'speedometer' on the field for the ball)  they actually run and try and COLLIDE with the damn thing.  Now that's gotta hurt!!!  So it was a tie game between Seoul and Daegu (another city in central Korea) but we were still marvelled with the stadium (although it does have a severe lack of concession stands) and the athleticism of the players.  I was supposed to meet up with Ailish, Barbara, Ellie, and Mark at the game but they arrived late and had to sit in a different section from us.  After the game my Ilsan friends headed home and I met up with my Shihung gang.  The five of us were *absolutely starving* so we headed back to our corner of the city to get something to eat.  After finding no restaurants to eat at Sindorim Station, we were forced to go all the way back to Bucheon Station to find something open.  We had some Korean for dinner and then decided to go for drinks.  We went to some bar just around the corner and had a good time just relaxing and chatting.  Everyone was pretty tired so we had an early night after that.  A good day!

      Today was an entire write-off!  I woke up at 1 in the afternoon and was pleasantly surprised to find that I wasn't hung over at all.  Last night was such a crazy night that I was expecting to pay for it dearly today, however, I felt perfectly fine when I woke up!  Hooray!  :-p  I did absolutely nothing all day except lounge around in my underwear and chat with friends back home on Messenger.  By the time I got showered and dressed, and had my first meal, it was nearly 7pm!  Whoa!  No matter though, it was Monsoon Madness outside so I wasn't planning on going anywhere.  What had started as a trickle last night when I was coming home from the bar last night had turned into a torrential downpour that lasted ALL DAY!  It never let up for a second, and in fact, seemed to be getting stronger as the day went on!  I had to venture out at one point to pick up some stuff to eat and I was nearly washed away in the floods that were pouring down my street.  Water was running *everywhere* and every single street was completely flooded out.  I haven't seen rain this hard in...I can't even remember when!  I was supposed to go out and hit the town with Austin tonight but we both decided to stay in cause of the weather.  Neither of us felt like going into Seoul with such hard rain - it would be pointless - we'd end up just looking like drowned rats, even with umbrellas!  It was definitely a good night to stay indoors.  I relaxed at home watching TV and catching up on my blog and email and then went to bed at a half-decent hour.    Sometimes you just need an entire day to do absolutely nothing and feel good about it!

      Today was a really long, emotionally and physically exhaustive day.  22 hours of an endurance marathon, full of all the wonderful and depressing things that life can serve up in one single day.  One of those days that feels like it was actually three days squeezed into one.    I was up bright and early today at 7:30am to get ready for my interview at the English Village (read English Cult) way out in the boonies.  The school is built out in Ansan, but the interview was in Suwon, both of which that are cities that may as well be in Rhode Island, for how far they feel to the rest of the city.  It was a long subway ride to get there, and then a ten-minute taxi trip before I arrived at the Gyeonggi English Culture Foundation Building.  As I've mentioned before, I didn't really have any interest in this job but thought I should check it out anyways in case I change my mind.  The interview was short but it was alright I guess.  I met one of the directors and several people who are all involved in the hiring process.  Everyone was friendly and I'll admit that the project does seem kinda cool, but I know that it's not for me.  Despite the awesome pay, I don't want to live way out in isolation.  And I prefer to work somewhere where I can go to work, do my thing, and then come home to my own, *separate* private life.  I like to keep work and 'outside work' apart from each other, and that would be really hard to do with this kind of job at the English Village.  I left the interview feeling pretty confident that I still did well with all the questions, despite feeling like a bit of a liar for pretending to be interested in it.  I was DYING to find out about Bundang and was feeling so sure that I was gonna get it.  So sure, in fact, that I took a bus from Suwon to Bundang so that I could hang out in Bundang until I got 'the call' (or 'the email') and then pop in to the school to thank them personally and sign all my contracts and paper work on the spot.  No sense delaying things!  They're eager for a teacher, and I'm eager to teach!  I was gonna hang out with Austin to kill time until I found out but he was busy so instead I went to an internet cafe.  The first thing I did was check my email - no response yet.  The anticipation was eating me alive inside!!!  Just give me an answer, goddammit!!!  I did receive an email from Poly Ilsan though telling me to let them know if I didn't get the job at Bundang.  Hmmm...  I chatted with friends online for a while until around 3pm when I couldn't stand waiting anymore.  I phoned the school and asked to speak to the director.  Why wait longer when you can find out for yourself right now?  I didn't get the job.  It hit me like a ton of bricks.  More like a ton of bricks soaked in rancid dog shit and covered in burning oil so that I can choke on the smells while burning alive under the crushing bricks.  In other words, it hit me pretty hard.  :-(  Despite going for the other interviews, my eggs really were all in the Bundang Basket.  Ilsan hadn't worked out, and no other job I had yet applied for did I want.  What the fuck was I going to do now?  Steven's been harrassing me all week, I told Cheungju I'd maybe go and work for them if I didn't get any jobs today, and now the worst-case scenario has gone through.  Can I afford to wait much longer looking for other jobs?  Should I just take something, anything and go with that?  Am I being too picky?  I've been turned down for two jobs this week...what's wrong with me?  Am I screwing up royally in the interviews?  Is the universe out to get me?  Why has all of this been so difficult?  I thought it was supposed to be easy to get great jobs in Korea???  It was a long subway ride home and I was totally depressed the whole way.  But suddenly I was thrown into a high-stress frenzy upon checking my email when I got home.  It was an email from my recruiter, telling me that the job in Hwajeong was mine if I wanted it, but I had to phone her RIGHT AWAY or it would be gone.  So I was stuck in this dilemma, not sure whether I should take a job I was only partially enthused about or wait for something better to come along.  But what if the Hwajeong job *was* the best job that was ever going to come along?  Or what if I take it (out of desperation and disappointment?) only to regret it later?  I literally only had minutes to make such a life-changing decision.  Before phoning my recruiter I decided to give Tim, the director at Ilsan, a call to find out what he meant by his email.  I rang him and upon telling him that I didn't get the Bundang job (he was also really surprised) he told me that some things had changed at the school and maybe there was a job, afterall, for me at Ilsan.  He said the school really, really liked me and wanted to get me on board, but he just wasn't sure if there was going to be a job right away.  I told him about my Hwajeon dilemma and that I'd rather have the Ilsan job (if there was one) but that I'd most likely take the Hwajeon job if his answer was no.  I only had a short amount of time to know because I was expecting an urgent call from my recruiter any minute demandind an answer on Hwajeong.  He became really excited and tense too, so he said he'd talk to his boss *immediately* and would get back to me in an hour or so.  So there I was, caught inbetween two possible jobs, both of which could completely fall out any second.  Would I be offered both, or lose the chance for either?  Ilsan was my first choice, most definitely, but what if I lost Hwajeon while waiting to find out about Ilsan, only to hear 'no' and then have NO JOB?  Fuck, the stress was killing me!!!  I decided that whoever phoned me next, that's the job I would take.  It was the only fair, semi-sensible way to choose.  And so I waited for the phone to ring, my fate in the balance, where would I end up?    The phone rang at exactly 7pm.  Who would it be, and what would the answer be?  It was Tim, offering me a teaching position at Ilsan!!!  I'VE BEEN SAVED!!!  HOORAY!!!! I was completely thrilled and so very very thankful to get that job!!!  It may start even as soon as Monday, with me doing class observations, and I couldn't be happier about it.  YAH!!!!!!!!!!  Wow, I went from such a low LOW to such a high HIGH in just 2 hours!!  Life is funny that way, eh?  I decided to go out tonight to celebrate.  Me, Mark, Ailish, Barbara and Ellie went out to Incheon for a night out on the town and it was awesome!!!  We first went to this bar called Africa and had some pre-drinks there.  Then we hit Goose Goose which is the bar popular with foreigners in this corner of Korea.  I've heard about it for a while but had yet to visit it.  It was a really great bar, people there were super friendly and I met lots of cool people.  We had TONS to drink and it was happy spirits all around for everyone.  Life is grand!!!  But man, can those Irish girls ever drink!!  I COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH THEM!!!  4:30am came around and I was totally exhausted but the three of them were still going strong!  Mark and I held out until around 5am or so and then gave in, we surrended, threw our hands up in the air and yelled out 'I surrender!  You win!  We give up.'  haha!  Him and I left the girls at the bar and caught a cab home.  By the time I got back to my apartment I had been up almost 22 hours and the sun was already starting to come up...  It's a very strange feeling to be going to bed when it's starting to get bright outside...    What a crazy, exhausting day today was.  Man am I ever ready for bed!!!  :-p

      This afternoon was my job interview for that position out in Hwajeong.  Hwajeong is right next to Ilsan and is another one of those 'new towns' that have sprung up from rice paddies in the blink of an eye.  The job at this school sounded alright, I wasn't overly excited about it from what my recruiter told me, but again, I need to keep my options open, right?  An interview certainly doesn't hurt, and it makes for good comparison with other jobs.  The school is about 2 hours journey from my house so I left really early to make sure that I arrived there on time.  The director of the school picked me up from the subway station and she was a really nice lady.  She was Korean but studied in the US for a while so her English was excellent.  She was super friendly and seemed like someone who would be a good boss.  First, before taking me to the school, she brought me to go and check out where I would be living if I took the job.  Man, the housing was super nice!!!  It was in a brand new building up on the 6th floor and was a totally modern suite - it even had a washer/DRYER!!!  Definitely seemed like it would be a cool space to live in.  She took me to go and check out the school after that.  The school is called Choral English College and it's a franchised chain of schools in Korea (just like REI and Poly.)  It was a new and small school but apparently is growing.  She told me about her plans to hire another teacher or two at the end of summer, in addition to this particular position, and that was relieving.  In these days of English schools closing all the time, and with my own experience, I'm a bit paranoid.  CEC seemed to have a fairly organized curriculam and the working hours were really attractive as well.    All in all it seemed like a good school, but for whatever reason I just wasn't excited about it.  There was something I just couldn't place my finger on.  There was nothing overtly wrong with the job or with the school, but I just didn't have the same excitement that I had when I interviewed at either of the two Poly's.  I really don't know why.  The vibe at the school was different, and I just wasn't itching to sign on like in other interviews.  Perhaps this is a sign?  Hard for me to say, I can't even fully understand it myself.  I left the interview feeling a bit unsure about the whole deal...  I rode back into Seoul and spent an entire afternoon devoted just to myself.  I spent over two hours in Kyobo browsing through all the wonderful books and CD's.  I can spend entire days in book stores and never, ever get bored of it.  I have so many books at home waiting patiently in line to be read so I'm not allowed to buy any right now, but I do love to browse.  It brings me such joy and peace to know that there's more amazing books out there in the world than I'll ever be able to read in one lifetime.  I think that's really, really cool.  I then went into the music section of the store and listened to a couple CD's, and then ended up buying two - Atomic Kitten's Greatest Hits and the new Avril Lavigne album (could there be two albums more opposite than those two???)  :-)    I then went to 'my Starbucks' to sit and read for a couple hours, something else I never get tired of doing.  I just finished 'Life of Pi' a few weeks ago (a thoroughly enjoyable read - I highly reccommend it) and have since moved onto 'White Oleander.'  I stole this book from my friend Graham's family collection they have out at their cabin a few years ago but only just now jumped into it.  It's been addictive so far, the kind of book you can get lost in for hours.  The characters are so rich and vivid and wonderfully complex and I totally lose myself in the story for a while everytime I read it.  I'm only about a third of the way so far, but it's been a really great book so far.  Later on I met up with Michael, Eric, and Tim for dinner, along with Gary and Tracy who are visiting Michael from Taiwan.  We all wandered through Insadong for a bit and then had a delicious dinner at a Korean restaurant.  After dinner we went to a board game bang and had a blast!  Koreans are all about 'bangs' (means 'room', and is pronounced like 'bong') and there's several varieties to choose from.  There's norabangs where you go and sing karaoke, there's DVD bangs where you go and watch a movie with a bunch of friends in your own small private theatre, and then there's board game bangs where you hang out with friends and play board games in a big room full of people doing the same thing as you!  They're all super cheap and tons of fun!!  This is the first of the bangs I've tried and it was a blast!  We rented Clue and the six of us had a great time!!!  It was the first time playing Clue for everyone but Michael and I, and even for myself it's been *years* since I've last played it.  I ended up winning 2/3 games and then had to head home on the train.  A very good day!  P.S. I find out tomorrow if I get the job at Bundang and the anticipation is KILLING ME!!!  Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!

      JOB SEARCHING SUCKS!!!  I hate having to wait to hear about jobs that I really want, and having to apply to jobs that I'm not all that enthused about just so that I don't 'put all my eggs in one basket.'  Now that Ilsan hasn't worked out, I'm really hoping to get that job at Bundang, but I have to wait another couple days to know.  I have a good feeling about it, but you never really know, right?  The waiting game totally sucks, and getting outside pressure just aggravates me even more.    My old boss Steven has been pissing me off all week long.  He keeps pressuring me to take jobs that I really don't have any interest in, whatsoever.  That job out in Cheungju, for example, just won't go away.  The director lady has phoned me a couple more times, hoping that I'll take the job but I have to keep telling her that I'm waiting on other jobs.  She's super nice and so it's hard to be frustrated with her, but she doesn't seem to get it.  Their new plan of attack (her and Steven) is that they want me to come work *temporarily* at that school in Cheunju, until I find a new job, and then go work for some 'English Village' out in the fucking boonies that Steven has been shoving down my throat all week.  This 'English Village' is some experiment the government is building to help improve the levels of English in the province and involves working at a year round 'summer camp' conducting a variety of activities with the kids.  The pay is really good, but it's REALLY REALLY far out and I don't wanna be isolated at some camp stuck living with all my coworkers and students in some dorm.  Thanks, but no thanks.   The frustrating thing is that I keep telling Steven that I'm looking at a number of other positions instead, but it doesn't seem to sink in with him.  I've been really polite but maybe with the language barrier he's just not understanding.  And on top of that, I had a really bad first introduction to this English Village.  One of the director ladies from the place gave me a call the other day, but it was a total cold call.  I had no idea she was going to phone me, and when she did she didn't even introduce herself or tell me where she was calling from.  I just answered the phone and she launched right into her questions in her terribly broken English.  The whole time I was like "who the fuck is this" in my head while talking to her.  Well I guess I was a little confused and flustered because of this, and I ended up stuttering a bit during our conversation.  Now all those who know me know that I have a bit of a stutter.  I don't stutter all the time during normal conversations, but for some reason I tend to stutter more on the phone than any other time.  This is something I've done all my life, but has improved as the years have gone on.  However, when it comes to teaching, or presentations, or public speaking, or anything really important, I almost never stutter.  It's like a different speaking side of me comes out for the things that really matter and it's almost never an issue.  I've been teaching in Korea for 4 months now and it's never once come up - no one at school has ever noticed.  Well anyways this director lady freaked out because of my stuttering and phoned Steven to inquire about it as soon as she got off the phone with me.  Apparently she was extremely concerned about my stuttering and demanded to 'what was wrong with me' and if I had any serious speech problems.  Steven became concerned about all of this and then phoned me right away to ask what was going on.  I told him it was because I was nervous and because I had a hard time understanding her poor English.  He seemed okay with this answer, but then proceeded to go on and on about why I shouldn't do that and that it's not good to stutter in interviews.  No shit!  And to piss me off even more he's phoned me pretty much everyday to remind me about all of this, and to not be nervous during interviews so I don't stutter.  It's made me extremely self-conscious and edgy.  I know it's not a problem with the job for me, but if people are now looking out for it, waiting to nail me for it, it could happen again.    I know that Steven is just trying to help me find a job and that he just wants to look out for my best interests, but his approaches leave me frustrated, annoyed, and feeling shitty about myself.  I also know that most of this is simply because of cultural and language barriers.  Koreans are notoriously insensitive towards people who are different or have disabilities, and I know he means well but it just comes across as pushy and demanding because of his limited English.  I just wanna tell him 'it's alright, I'll find my own job, thanks' but don't want to be rude and so I just hold my tongue during all of this (something really hard for me to do!)  I can't wait until I find a job (MY OWN JOB) and then get out of this situation!

      So I received a bit of a disappointing email today.  It was from one of the directors at Poly Ilsan and he was writing to inform me that there wasn't any openings for me at that school.  They had already begun hiring some new people before I had applied and so unless any of them backed out there wasn't going to be any room for me.  I was bummed out to hear this because I really liked Brad's school, but it was totally understandable.  They had made commitements to people other than me and I respect them for honouring that.  Ahh well, it just means that I really REALLY hope that I get the Poly Bundang job!!  I had offered to take Ailish's two friends visiting from Ireland, Barbara and Ellie, into the city to check out some of Seoul's attractions since Ailish had to work all week and I have all this free time.  I met the girls around 11am and we headed into the city on the subway.  We went for lunch at Subway and then went and hit Insadong head on to do some serious shopping.  The girls loved all the stores in Insadong and bought tons of cool little presents for their friends back home.  After that we went to Changbeokgung Palace on the English tour.  The girls loved the palace and even though I've been there several times now (including just last month with Henry!) I still really enjoyed it.  After the palace tour I took them over to a big Buddhist temple not far from Insadong.  I don't remember its name, but it's a magnificent temple that is currently under reconstruction.  It's covered in scaffolding and tarp, but it's still a beautiful building.  We quietly entered the temple and sat for a few minutes to watch the worshippers pray and just take in the atmosphere.  After the temple we wandered back through Insadong and went and had some dinner at Bennigan's.  The girls have been having a hard time adjusting to Korean cuisine since arriving so I tried to stuff them full of familiar Western food all day today!  Bennigan's claims to be an "Irish/American eatery" so we all fit right in there, and everything on the menu was familiar.  It was a great dinner!!  After dinner we cabbed it over to Itaewon to try and retrieve Barbara's lost shoes that she left at the motel (no luck!) and then did a little more shopping.  After Itaewon we headed back on home to Shihung to relax for a while at Ailish's.  Tuesday nights are solid gold when it comes to television - The OC and 3 episodes of Sex And The City.  Right on!!  We all stayed up to watch the shows and had a great time just hanging out together.  Barbara and Ellie are great fun and super nice girls - I had a total blast hanging out with them today.  I hope to see more of them before they leave back home for Ireland next week!

      So I had a job interview this morning that I was totally stoked about!  It was with Poly (the company Brad used to work at) but only at a different campus - Bundang.  Bundang is an affluent suburb in the SE corner of the city and is also where both Maeve and Austin live.  I've only been to Bundang a couple of times but I remember it being really clean and green.  It's one of the more prestigious places in the city to live in and is also a completely planned city, from the bottom up.  I was being interviewed Jill, who was a friend of Brad's and who I've met on many occasions.  The interview went exceptionally well!  Knowing Jill ahead of time made me really comfortable during the interview, and I seemed to answer each and every question bang on.  I got a tour of the school and was again really impressed with the quality of the facility that Poly provides.  Bundang Poly is a bit smaller than Ilsan's, but has great natural lighting and is really aesthetically pleasing.  I also met all the staff who work there and everyone seemed really nice!  The position I'm applying for is the evening shift, working with the older, more advanced kids teaching grammar.  It's the same job that Brad had at his school and he seemed to enjoy it a lot.  I got a great vibe from the school and really hope that I get the position!!  WISH ME LUCK!!!  I was told at the end of the interview that I'd find out if I got the job on Friday, which means I have to wait five whole long days to find out if I got it or not.  But I'm impatient - I wanna know now!!!  ;-)  I had plans to meet up with Austin for lunch so I gave him a rang and he came down to meet me near Poly.  We went to TGI Friday's for lunch and it was really cool to hang out just him and I.  He's a super nice guy and a lot of fun to be around.  What's really cool, is that he's moving to VANCOUVER in December!  Wow small world eh???  After lunch we hung out at his place for a bit watching 'Hook' that was on TV and then it was time for me to make the big journey back to Shihung (2 hours on the trains!!)  On the way home though I got myself in big trouble...but it's not my fault, I swear!  I was on the subway, about half way home, and was on the Green Line which is *always* packed full with people.  I don't think I've ever seen Line 2 NOT crowded, regardless of the time of day.  Well I was just standing there, listening to my Discman, when these 5 Korean teen girls came on to the train.  They saw me and were excited to see a foreigner on the train.  Now people *always* stare at you on the subway, and I do mean everybody.  You get used to the staring, but the teen girls always giggle and make more fuss than anyone else.  Well the girls came over to stand next to me, and were amazed with my height (but isn't everybody??)  ;-)  They kept trying to reach up as high on the pole (to hold on to so you don't fall) as I could but (obviously) couldn't reach that high.  They didn't speak any English so we weren't even talking to each other, but they were making a lot of squealing and such in Korean.  They kept jumping and stretching, trying to reach as high as I could, all the while looking at me and giggling.  It was all harmless fun, I didn't mind at all, and clearly I wasn't bothering the girls...  All of a sudden this old man from the other end of the car pushed his way through the crowd towards us and just started SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS in Korean at the girls!  He screamed and screamed (God knows what, man I wish I spoke Korean!) but the girls got really quiet and looked all embarrassed and shy.  Some of them sat down and put their heads down while others covered up their bare arms and shoulders (they weren't wearing anything overly sexy, even for Korean standards.)  So the old man didn't even look at me once, he just kept yelling at the girls, but I knew that it was about me because EVERY SINGLE OTHER PAIR OF EYES on the train were all on me!!!  I felt so mortified and I didn't even know why!  So I really don't know exactly what the man was yelling about, but obviously he didn't approve of their behaviour, and that somehow it was related to me.  Maybe he was scolding them for 'flirting' with me, or maybe he thought their clothing was inappropriate.  Maybe he thought they were bothering me, or maybe he thought they weren't acting what was 'proper' for girls their age.  I have no idea.  But I certainly felt bad!  The train was absolutely silent after that, and people still continued to S-T-A-R-E at me for a while.  I wish I understood and spoke Korean so that I could know what it was all about, and tell off that old man cause I sure don't think he had any good reason to yell at those harmless girls like that.  Go mind your own fuckin business!   Ahh well, I'm the foreigner here, I often don't understand what's going on or what's appropriate...  Perhaps I need to learn how to better behave myself in public, and flirt less with giggling teenage girls?    Nahhhhh.....  ;-)

      We all woke up today after a good long sleep, and surprisingly none of us had a hangover!  We packed up all our gear and drove on out of town to seek out the river we had booked ourslves at for rafting.  Our appointment was for 11am and we arrived just in time at the river!  We met our rafting guide, the other 3 people who had signed up for this raft, and then got all suited up with gear.  We walked down to the river's edge and were led into an exercise session to loosen up our joints for the trip.  Our rafting guide didn't speak a word of English so Eric had to translate everything for us! I had been rafting once before back home in BC and remember it being an absolute blast.  This was going to be great fun!!!  The river's water was actually pleasantly cool (unlike the frigid waters we had swam in with the teen girls the day before) and the gorge was absolutely beautiful.  Steep volcanic rock walls with waterfalls and dramatic cliffs welcomed us as we hopped onto the raft and set sail downstream.    It turned out to be a fun day, but not quite as exciting as we had hoped for...  The rivers are really low this time of year, so there was pretty much no 'white water' on this waterway for us to throw ourselves down!  In fact, the water was so shallow in places that we often got stuck on rocks!  A few times, we even got stuck mid-rapid and had to GET OUT OF THE RAFT and CARRY OUR RAFT to deeper water!  Where's the adventure in that?  That part was kinda disappointing, but we still had great fun.  The weather was hot, the scenery gorgeous, and we got to do some swimming and even some cliff-diving in the gorge.  And hey for only $28CDN for three hours of being outdoors on a river who can complain?  We all had good times and got REALLY SUNBURNED!  My knees were crimson-red by the end of the day and hurt like hell.  Feel free to call me Lobster Boy!  After rafting we were all starved but wanted to have dinner back in the city so we drove back to Seoul.  It took about 2 hours to get back to the city and luckily traffic was fairly minimal.  We headed back to Itaewon and then went and had a DELICIOUS dinner at an Indian restaurant.  I've had some disappointing Indian food here in Korea, but this was sinfully scrumptious!  We gorged ourselves on the buffet and then rolled on home afterwards.  Rafting didn't turn out quite as we had hoped for, but we still had a blast this weekend.  It just goes to show that often the most fun things in life are the times that are totally random and completely un-planned (like frolicking with teen girls in creeks, or dancing with Koreans at a BBQ under the stars!)  Haha!  :-)

      Today was a perfect, beautiful, hot summer day!  Soaring temperatures with almost no humidity and bright clear blue skies!  Wow!!  You can't ask for nice weather than this!  Summer has arrived in full force in Korea and I'm loving the sunshine!  (Now if I could just get rid of the humidity on all those other days...)  Eric and Tim arrived at Michael's around 9am and the four of us drove down to Bundang to pick up Maeve.  It was going to be the five of us for the weekend and we were all really excited about it! We stopped at a grocery store to pick up snacks and ingredients so we could make our own batch of sangria that night, and then got Maeve and headed out of the city.  Our destination was a recreational area a few hours north of Seoul, nestled right against the North Korea border.  Our drive up was beautiful and we were all hot and sticky and dying for a swim when we arrived at our destination town a few hours later. Our rafting wasn't until tomorrow so we thought we'd find a place to stay for the night and then go seek out a lake or river to swim in.  All the resort hotels we had originally hoped to stay in were all booked up, but a front desk lady suggested we go check out a group of 'cabins' up the road that might have some space.  We drove up this dirt road in middle-of-nowhere Korea and came upon this dusty virtual ghost town in this very scenic valley.  We found the 'cabins' that we could rent and it wasn't exactly what we had expected...  It really was just a big, empty wooden house split into two parts for tourists to rent out.  It wasn't all that nice, but the price was right (80,000 Won, or about $80 CDN split by five) so we took it.  We rented the smaller of the two parts but the grounds came with a BBQ pit so we thought that would be fun later on tonight.  We suited ourselves up and drove down to the 'big lake' just down the road.  There aren't many bodies of water of substantial size in Korea so finding a lake really is a rarity.  The lake unfortunately turned out to be a massive disappointment!  It was less than half full of water and was surrounded by gross disgusting mud flats.  The entire area smelled and looked more like a giant mud puddle than a lake.  Certainly not the refreshing forest lake that we had hoped for!  And on top of that, some stupid fair had set up on the shores, so it was swarming with Korean tourists checking out the make-shift fair rides, sad pathetic petting zoo, and the less-than-pleasant-sounding Korean bands.  Forget this!  We're outta here!  We drove up the road until we found a provincial park with a stream that you could apparently swim in (according to the gate attendant.)  The stream was really small but appeared clean and uncrowded and refreshingly cool.  We kept walking upstream until we found a trail that led down to a small pool formed by the creek.  When we got to the pools we discovered that we weren't alone...  Across the creek from us were about 10-15 Korean teenage girls, all around 16 years old.  They all became very excited when they saw us five foreigners coming down to the creek.  It was quite the welcoming committee for our international crew (a Canadian, an American, a Korean, a German, and an Irish girl!)  The five of us relaxed around the creek for a bit and just enjoyed the natural surroundings.  This is when things got real interesting, across the creek from us...  Apart from our original welcome the teen girls actually left us alone while we were lounging, but then they started to (unknowingly) put on quite a spectacular show for us...I'm still grinning in disbelief and amusement while thinking about it...  All of the teen girls were fully clad in their school uniforms - white blouses with plaid skirts - very Britney Spears a-la "Baby One More Time" video.  Well they started to all get a little hyper so they began to chase each other around the pond, tickling each other and giggling uncontrollably.  Suddenly the inevitable happened - one of the girls fell in to the water - school uniform and all.  She emerged from the pond completely soaked and even more charged with hyperness.  This is when all hell/heaven broke loose, depending on your perspective.  Simultaneously, as if directed by some un-seen porn director hiding in the bushes, all the girls began throwing each other into the pond and engaging in explosions of tickling and horseplay in the creek.  Water fights broke out, girls chased each other around the edges while other girls tackled each other and rolled around in the pond together, giggling and squealing the entire time uncontrollably.  We all stared in complete surprise!  It was right out of some porno!  For anybody who has a thing for bouncing teen girls in soaking wet school uniforms tickling her 15 closest friends while wrestling in a pond, this would be like dying and going to cradle-robbing nirvana!  Who would've thought that this kind of stuff *actually* happens in REAL LIFE!!!???  After watching the Korean version of Christina Aguilera's 'Dirrty' unfold before our very eyes, we decided to go for a swim ourselves.  We stuck to our end of the pool so as to not encourage the girls to ask us a million and one English questions, but I couldn't resist.  Being the incessant flirt that I am, I swam on over to their end of the pool.  I wasn't even half way there when they all noticed and started to get very excited.  A chorus of "What's your name?"  "Where are you from?"  "How old are you?"  "Do you have a girlfriend?" erupted from the bevy of teen girls in my direction.  I stayed swimming in the pool, but a couple of them waded back into the creek to chat with me.  Suddenly one of the more feisty girls splashed some water on me and that was it.  Less than a second later and I was engaged in a Wet 'n Wild World War Three Water Fight with the teen girls!  All I saw was a flurry of drenched plaid skirts and SOAKED WHITE BLOUSES as the water fight escalated to an even more-heightened pitch than what the girls had done before on their own.  Water was flying everywhere, girls were squealing, hell I was squealing too!  It was nuts!  Where's a video camera when you need one?  After over twenty minutes of water play-fighting, English conversation lessons, and many marriage proposals to me, I swam back to my friends who teased me FOR THE REST OF THE WEEKEND about being such a big bad flirt.  Hey I'll admit it!  What can I say?  I just can't help myself...hehe!  ;-)  After our swim/soft porn auditions, we were all starved so we headed into town to buy a bunch of ingredients for our BBQ.  We drove back to our cabin and got our BBQ pit all flared up.  We ended up having an absolutely delicious dinner of burgers, chicken, and grilled vegetables while sitting under a perfectly clear starry night.  WOW!  In Seoul you just don't ever see the stars with all the light pollution - I had practically forgotten what they looked like!  We also made up a giant bucket of sangria and we wasted no time in diving into that!    We also discovered that the other half of the cabin had been rented too by a big group of late 20's/early 30's Koreans.  They were engaged in their own BBQ and were blasting English pop music out of their van and dancing under the stars while doing shots of Soju.  A few of them spoke English and invited us to join them.  Turns out they were all on some 'corporate retreat' for the weekend and were happy to meet us foreigners.  We were a bit shy at first but after some more sangria and soju we joined our new friends and we all had this big outdoor dance party!  It was awesome, to be out drinking and dancing under the stars with my friends and a bunch of Koreans!!  Another random totally crazy Asian moment!!  haha!!!  Eventually the Koreans left to go and find a Norabang room (karaoke) but the five of us stayed behind to continue drinking and dancing away.  It was so warm and beautiful outside - gotta love summer!  Maeve broke out her digicam and of course the requisitve silly drunken photos ensued!  Oh, there'll be a very large stack of incriminating photos against me for one day when I'm rich and famous.  Future tabloids will never, ever run out of embarrassing material to print against me! LOL!    We had such a busy day that we were all pooped out pretty early, and so we were in bed before 1am.  We all crashed in our little cabin and enjoyed our sangria and soju-induced dreams all night long...  :-)

      ...like a chicken with my head cut off!  That was the best way to describe what my day was like today!  I had a million and one things to do today and they all had to be done RIGHT AWAY.  Having been gone for so long from my home, I had a lot of stuff to take care of regarding job searching.  I had resumes to mail off, jobs to apply for, phone calls to recruiters and schools to make, plus drop in at my old school to pick up some documents.  Because I'm going to have to get a new work visa when this new job comes along, I'll need all my original paperwork so I can jump through all those hoops one more time.  I went down to REI and was shocked to find that Steven had actually been able to find all my papers for me - WOW!  He's normally so unorganized I was terrified that he had lost them.  Thank God I have them now, safe and sound, in my own possession.  When I got home from the school, I also had two loads of laundry to do, dishes to wash, and I had to unpack all my luggage from Jeju/staying out in Ilsan.  Whew!  No rest for the wicked!  After all that, I had to re-pack a bunch of luggage to prepare for my weekend away.  Yes, another weekend away!  God when am I ever going to see my own bed?  haha!!  Michael had invited me to go white water rafting this weekend and so I was going to crash at his place tonight so we could have an early departure time tomorrow morning.  Sounds like great fun!  During dinner tonight I got a strange phone call...  It was from the school in Cheongju that Steven had originally wanted me to take that I turned down.  Well the call was two of the foreign teachers who work there phoning me to talk about how great the school and city is and why I should move there.  After that the director of the school got on the phone and practically pleaded me to come take the job!  Apparently they're going to one teacher short in just a week and are starting to panic as their last teacher backed out at the last minute.  It was kinda weird to get the cold call without any warning (I didn't even know they had my home number!) but I have to say that they were all super nice.  They actually all seemed like cool people and yeah it would be a good school to work at, but still way too far out for me.    I caught a subway into town to meet up with Michael for the night, and ended up joining him and Eric at Gecko's Garden for some drinks.  They were already through a bottle of red wine by the time I got there, but we ordered a big ass pitcher of sangria and enjoyed the night sitting out on the outdoor patio.  I ran into Meighan at Gecko's while there which was pretty cool - small world!  It was nice to sit and unwind with my friends after a busy day.  It's gonna be a really great weekend and I'm really looking forward to it.

      Today was a really sad day!  It was the day when Brad and Andrea left Korea to fly back home to Canada.  Brad was going to pop in at his school for one last time to say goodbye this morning, and he invited me along to meet his coworkers and boss, and check out the school.  Apparently Poly Ilsan is hiring some new teachers and Brad has put in a good word for me with his bosses - maybe I'll be able to get a job there?  I wasn't too crazy about the idea at first cause I wasn't sure if I wanted to live way out in Ilsan.  My whole plan was to get a job right in Seoul but it doesn't hurt to look anyway.  Within only a few minutes, though, I was completely converted!  Poly is SUCH a nice school - a school with money and resources and actual organization!  They have a library and a computer lab and all the rooms are fitted with books and school supplies.  WOW!!  What a contrast to the harsh ghetto Stalinist Russian conditions I've been working in!  I was totally blown away!  On top of that, I got to sit in on two of the classes to see how they ran.  Once again I was completely (and pleasantly!) surprised!  The kids are not only really well-behaved and listen to their teachers, but have a really advanced understanding of English!  I was sitting in on a class of 7 year-olds and they were learning about all the different cloud types - cumulus, cirrus, etc.  And they totally understood!  Wow these kids are so smart!  What a treat they would be to teach!  After this I got to speak to one of the directors for a bit and he was really nice.  I made sure to let them know that I was interested in a position there.  Who knows, maybe I'll be working in Islan soon?  The rest of the day was spent helping Brad and Andrea do all their last-minute packing.  Man, they have a lot of shit to pack up!!  Brad's apartment was total chaos and full of clothes and books and paper and old food and odds n ends here and there and everywhere.  But, slowly but surely, they got it all organized and packed away to get ready for the long plane ride home.  I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE LEAVING!  One of Brad's students even stopped by to say goodbye - he was so cute and seemed really really sad that Brad was leaving too.  And then it was 4:30pm and their ride to the airport had arrived, and now it was my turn to say goodbye.  It was very sad and surreal - it just felt like I was saying goodbye for the week and that I'd see them again next weekend.  But a small part of me inside knew that this was going to be the last time I'd see them for a long time.  Goodbyes totally suck!  I've never been very good at them.  I rarely ever get emotional during goodbyes, it tends to sink in more later on...  One last big hugs to my two best buddies here in Korea and then that was it.  They were gone.  Even just walking through their neighbourhood to catch the bus back home things felt emptier already.  My life in Korea just ain't gonna be the same without them.  :-(  When I got home I called my friend Ailish.  She had some friends in town from Ireland and they had invited me to join them for a night of drinking in Anyang.  I wasn't gonna go cause I was sad from the goodbyes, but thought that just sitting at home sulking would be pointless so I went out with them.  I met up with Ailish and Anne, and got to meet Ailish's friends visiting her from Dublin - Barbara, Eleanor, and Chris.  The six of us caught a cab to Anyang where we met up with Hannah and Bernie and a few of their friends at a bar.  We all ordered some dinner and drinks and had a great time just chatting away.  It's fun to hang out with a large group of people from another country - after a while I think I could even *understand* most of the Irish accent!  haha!  We only stayed until around midnight or so as were all kinda tired.  I caught a cab home with Anne and went to sleep right away.

      Today Andrea and I decided to go and check out the south coast of Jeju Island.  We got on a bus and only an hour later were in Seogwipo, the second largest city on the island. Unlike the first two days of our trip, today was bright and sunny with clear blue skies, and REALLY REALLY HOT outside!  It actually felt like we were on a sub-tropical island today!  We decided to go and check out Cheonjiyeonpokpo which is a trio of tropical waterfalls that plummet in a series of dramatic dropoffs in a spectacular river gorge.  You have to hike down a looooong stairwell into the gorge and it feels like you're climbing down into Hawaii or Thailand or Tahiti or something.  The forest is all thick jungle vegetation and the waters are the brighest turquoise colour that you have ever seen!  The gorge is made of sheer volcanic cliffs and it really does look and feel like paradise!  We spent a good hour exploring the trails through the gorge and took time to reflect next to the three beautiful waterfalls that gouge the canyon.  Man, it's great being an unemployed tourist in Korea - haha!!!  After the waterfalls we walked down to the ocean.  On the way there we enjoyed the hot sunshine, the lush smells of all the tropical flowers, and the cool sights of the tall skinny palm trees lining the city streets.  We were about to walk over a bridge over the canyon when we looked down and saw this poor, lonely horse tied up all by himself down below.  There was absolutely no one around so Andrea and I went down to go and visit the horse.  The poor horse was stuck on this short rope in the hot sun with no shade and no company.  He had a big bucket for water but it was completely empty.  We pet the horse for a while (he was really friendly and tame) and then decided to give him some water.  We took out our giant 2 L bottle of spring water and emptied it into his bucket.  The poor guy drank it all up in about 15 seconds!  He definitely seemed like he was still thirsty so we went down to the river and filled up our bottle a couple more time with water.  It was our Good Samaritan deed for the day, and the horse sure seemed to be happy about it!  Just up the road from there, on the way to our next stop, we passed through the massive brand new convention centre that the Koreans have built to attract visitors to the island.  While walking through the convenntion centre, Andrea and I encountered an entire class of middle school boys out on a field trip.  Given the fact not many foreigners live on Jeju, we proved to be quite a fascinating sight for these boys.  Within thirty seconds we were completely surrounded by at least 30 of the school boys who stared at is in wonder and curiousity.  Like a pack of velociraptors, each of them would approach and ask a question in English while another would come up to the other one of us from a different side and do the same thing.  Andrea and I could only spin around and around and answer question after question.  I've been approached by groups of friendly and inquisitive students before, but never by a group as large as this!  It was fun, but a little intimidating at the same time.  So many students, so many questions, so many eyes fixed upon us!  After ten minutes or so of the question and answer period from our young teen fans we headed out of the centre and towards the coast.  We walked on over to Jusangjolli Rocks.  Jusangjolli Rocks are one of the biggest attractions on all of Jeju.  It is here on the south coast where lava from Mount Halla poured directly into the sea.  The combination of the super hot lava meeting the super cold sea resulted in instant cooling, causing the lava to form into giant hexagonal pillars that stretch for kilometres along the coast.  The lava rock looks like giant vertical honeycomb!  These jagged columns are identical in size and shape and form a rugged yet refined wall of pillars that are fascinating to look at.  They look almost man-made, but are shaped completely by Mother Nature alone.  We took quite a few photos and then wandered down the trail.  We came upon a stairwell that actually ran right down to the water next to these uniquely-shaped rocks, and spent a good hour or so climbing up and down the terraces of lava pillars.  It was great fun and a totally cool experience to be able to see these things up close and personal.  Climbing over lava rocks on an island off the coast of Korea - how cool is that!!??  We then decided to go and find a taxi to take us back to the bus terminal so we could get ready to head back home.  We went back to the convention centre to call a taxi, and this is when 'The Swarming - Part Deux' took place.  Only this time it with a ferocity never before experienced by this humble Canadian boy.  When approaching the centre we ran into several bus loads of...teenage girls.  Oh God!  The giggling! The crying out of joy and excitement!  The fawning!!!  For a good 20 minutes or more Andrea and I (well, mostly me) were surrounded by hordes of teenage girls who were absolutely fascinated with us.  They fawned over us like we were pop stars at a concert.  They yelled out questions and "You are very handsome!!!" in a chorus of squealing and laughing.  Group upon group of these super-hyper teen girls came up to have their picture taken with me.  I'd put my arm around one of them and they'd all *SCREAM* with excitement!  Seriously, I felt like a world-famous Hollywood celebrity!  There were flashes of cameras everywhere and I can honestly say I've never had so much attention directed towards me in my entire life.  We were completely and utterly and helplessly swarmed by these teenage girls (and I loved every minute!)  After the 'Meet n Greet' time with 'our fans' we finally jumped into our taxi that arrived and sped off.  Some of the girls practically ran after the cab and tried to get more pictures of us through the windows.  It was crazy!  (But SO MUCH FUN!  hehe!!)  We caught our bus back to Jeju City and went and checked out of our motel.  We then went and had PizzaHut for dinner and then took a cab over to the airport.  Our flight took off just after 7pm and we were landing in Seoul at around a quarter after eight.  Our short 3-day holiday came and went so fast but it felt like we had travelled so far to some distant exotic land!  Wow!  It was Brad and Andrea's last night in town so there was a big goodbye dinner for them in Ilsan.  The entire gang showed up and we all had an awesome dinner at a really great Thai restaurant.  It was fun to socialize with everyone and hang out as a big group one last time.  We then headed back to Brad's place where Brad and Andrea continued their last minute packing.  I crashed at Steve's again so that Brad and Andrea could enjoy their last night of romance together before heading back to their respective hometowns in Canada.  I was really tired from three very active days of touring, but what an amazing trip I had.  Andrea and I had such a blast together (we're great travel buddies!) and Jeju was more beautiful than I ever could have imagined!  I'm so lucky to be able to experience such cool things!  How awesome is my life??!!  :-)

      Today was Day 2 of our Jeju Island Adventure.  Andrea and I woke up bright and early and took a cab to the nearby ferry terminal in Seongsan so that we could catch a ferry to Udo Island.  Udo is a very small island just off-shore from Jeju and is very rural, but is very beautiful as well and something not to be missed.  The ferry ride was only about 20 minutes long or so and when we go to Udo we were a little unsure as to how to tackle the sights of the island.  Luckily some Korean guys who operated a bus tour of the island solved that problem for us!  For only 4000 Won (less than $5 CDN) we got a 2 hour bus-tour of the island that stopped at three scenic points of interest on the island.  What a deal!  The first stop was these massive cliffs that rise up high above the rest of the island.  We could see all of Udo's lush green pastures from the top as well as Jeju in the near distance.  What's really cool about Udo is that the whole island is full of graves!  The Koreans bury their ancestors just about wherever they feel like it on Udo, and mark the grave with granite tombstones, but what's really unique about these graves is how they're guarded.  In order to keep wandering livestock from trampling onto the sacred ancient graves, small stone walls made of volcanic rock have been built around the gravesite.  The result is a landscape full of green pastures dotted by stone squares with a grave in the middle.  Very eerie, very cool.  After that we went to a beach that was made up of black volcanic sand just like the one we saw the day before.  On the way to our third site I experienced another one of those random "OMG I'm in Korea moments!" that seem to hit me like a tsunami now and then.  We were on the bus, which was filled entirely with ajimas (older Korean ladies - average age probably around 50 or 60) when the driver decided to put on some K-pop (Korean pop music) at full blast.  Suddenly the ajimas started to cheer out in excitement over the music and they all began to clap and chant in time with the song!  It was completely unexpected, and so funny to see a bunch of old ladies rocking out to cheesy techno pop music!  Our third stop was a beach made up entirely of CORAL!  I guess storms and ocean currents wash up all these shells and coral from the strait separating Udo from Jeju and its apparently one of the only coral beaches in the whole world!  This coral beach is pure white (quite a contrast from all the other black beaches on the island) and it was really cool to walk around the beach and examine the coral beneath our feet.  You almost feel bad about walking on top of it, but surprisingly none of it breaks under your weight.  All the coral pieces look like tiny white brains when examined up close - quite a curious sight.  After exploring the coral beach for a while we got back on the bus which returned us to the ferry terminal.  We boarded the boat again and headed back to Jeju.  We left Seongsan and travelled back west across the island until we reached Sangumburi Crater.  Sangumburi is unique amongst the island's craters as it is the only one located in the middle of a field and not on top of a small mountain.  Its also supposed to be the widest of all the craters and really beautiful.  Unfortunately we didn't get to see any of it!  We hiked up to the edge and looked out...but all we could see was FOG!  It was a super foggy day on the island and this crater is notorious for 'collecting' fog that roams across the island.  All we could see was a wall of grey.  It was a bit disappointing but ahhh well, you can't control these things.  We then decided to head back to the capital.  We caught a bus and cruised into Jeju City and got another motel room for the night.  It was only late afternoon so Andrea and I decided to go and check out Mysterious Road.  Oh, the magic and marvels and mysteries of...Mysterious Road...that lay waiting for us....sooooo strange!  On Jeju Island are two roads where a very strange phenomenon occurs - something that exists in only a few odd, random locations scattered around the planet.  These are sites where the laws of gravity are defied before your very eyes, and that challenge you to question the so-called notions of physics.  Mysterious Road is one of these sights, and let me tell you it is SO WEIRD to watch what happens when you're there...  Mysterious Road is on a hill, and the perplexing phenenomon that occurs there is that if you drive to this one spot on the hill, and put the car in neutral, it will ROLL BACKWARDS UP THE HILL!!!  I KID YOU NOT!!!  It sounds crazy but I saw it for myself!  You stand on the side of the road and watch as people pull up, put their vehicles in neutral, and sure enough, each and every time, the car or truck will roll backwards up the hill.  It's only a 200 metre stretch but it's the freakiest thing to watch!  Even TOUR BUSSES that come get pulled UP the hill!  What's even freakier is that when you're standing in 'the zone' where this occurs you experience strange headaches!  You feel drowsy and tired and disoriented - almost dizzy - but as soon as you step out of 'the zone' the headache disappears instantly.  HOW WEIRD IS THAT!!!???    Apparently the truth behind Mysterious Road is that its an optical illusion.  The cars *appear* to be rolling uphill, but in reality its actually downhill.  But it sure is a convincing sight otherwise let me tell you - it damn well looks UPHILL to me!  It's a totally freaky place - you can even try the experiment in other ways.  If you pour water on the road it flows in the opposite direction you think it would.  And if you drop a plastic bottle onto the road it pauses for a second or two and then also rolls up the hill.  WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD!  Andrea and I thought the whole place had a very 'X-Files' feel to it.  We kept expecting Mulder and Scully to show up to investigate!  As a joke we had me lay down on the road and pretend to be 'sucked up the hill' by the supernatural forces of the hill, all the while screaming in mock fear, and Andrea filmed the whole thing.  SO HILARIOUS!!!  (and yes I'll do *anything* for the camera, it seems!)  After our encounter with Mysterious Road we headed back into town to grab some dinner.  We went to a nice Western restaurant that was right on the waterfront and had a delicious meal.  We tried to go and see a movie after dinner, but there was nothing in town playing that we wanted to see.  Instead we bought more cookies (we're ADDICTED to these Pepperidge Farm cookies that are sold only at LG25 convenience stores in Korea) and went back to the motel to watch a movie on TV.  We watched 'Planet Of The Apes' (not bad actually!) and then went to sleep.  Another awesome day!

      Today was the beginning of a great three day odyssey!    Andrea and I woke up bright and early and cabbed on over to Gimpo Airport to catch our flight to Jeju Island.  Gimpo was Seoul's old international airport, but since the new one opened up in Incheon a few years ago, Gimpo has been rendered to handling domestic flights only.  Even though it was only 8:30am in the morning when we arrived at the airport and we had had hardly any sleep, Andrea and I were as giddy as a couple of schoolgirls looped up on a bucket of sugar candy!  We were totally excited to not only go to Jeju, but just the fact that this was a TRIP that involved FLYING somewhere made us climb the walls with excitement and anticipation!    Our flight to Jeju International Airport on KoreanAir was such a deal for us - only about $170 CDN return!  Since the flight is just under an hour I was expecting to board a small jetliner or maybe even just a prop plane to Jeju - boy was I wrong!  We were ushered onto a gorgeous AirBus A330 - the same size jumbo jet as the one that carried me from Vancouver across the Pacific!  The plane was totally full too - WOW - *everyone* wants to fly to Jeju!  The flight was smooth and comfortable and so short - we were up in the air and then landing at Jeju in no time at all it seemed.  Our plan upon arrival was to try and see if we could rent a car to travel around the island.  However, we were soon shot down in cold blood by the totalitarian Hertz ladies who wouldn't rent us a car without an international driver's license.  We sorta saw this coming, but we thought we'd give it a shot anyways!  ;-)  We sat down and worked out a basic itinerary about what we wanted to see and do on Jeju, and decided to get out of the capital Jeju City right away to go and explore the eastern side of the island.  We caught a bus and cruised towards the town of Seongsan.  Jeju Island is an incredibly beautiful island, and definitely the most scenic part of Korea that I've seen yet!  It doesn't feel like you're in Korea at all - it's only an hour away but we felt so removed from the rest of the country.  Not only is Jeju's culture different because it's so far off-shore from the mainland and therefore developed in a relatively isolated manner from the rest of the country for centuries, but in a physical sense the landscape is very different.  The best way I can describe Jeju is 'Ireland meets Hawaii.'  It has lush green rolling fields and pastures with stone walls dividing the properties and dramatic cliff shorelines (like Ireland) but it also has volcanoes and palm trees and tropical vegetation not found anywhere in the world this far north (like Hawaii.)  SO BEAUTIFUL!!!  We got a cheap hotel room in the seaside town of Seongsan (less than $30 CDN) and made a b-line for our first island destination - Manjanggul.  Manjanggul is an enormous undergound lava tube - at just over 13 km. in length its the longest known lava tube in the world.  The tube is absolutely enormous - large enough that you can drive a transport truck through most of it!  Only about 1 km. of it is open to the public to walk through and it was an amazing experience.  The lava tube is just underneath the surface but is dark and wet and feels like you're DEEP underground.  It's a blast to walk through it and check out all the hardened magma that once ran through the tube when the island's volcano last erupted about 25,000 years ago.  The walls are perfectly round, jet black, and still look like they're wet and gooey.  Half way up the wall of the tube are 'racing stripes' that the flowing magma carved into the rock while flowing through the tube.  For geography/volcano buffs like me, this was the coolest place ever! There was even a giant chunk of lava that looks like a turtle, and at the end of the walk is a hardened pillar of lava that once flowed from the upper chamber of the tube down into the main lava pipe - a frozen magma waterfall!  So cool!  After the lava tube we walked down the road to a hedge maze that some British guy built on the island a long time ago.  The maze is in the shape of the island and Andrea and I had a fun time running through the maze trying to find our way out.  We were in one of our silly moods again so we filmed a couple hilarious videos of us pretending to be in a music video - turning and spinning through the maze while gesturing to the camera - think Loreena McKennitt meets Madonna's 'Nothing Really Matters'.  Too much fun!  After the maze we headed back to Seongsan to chill out and relax.  The weather today was really cloudy and grey with misty clouds rolling by - it was actually really beautiful and gave the whole island a very 'midevil' feel to it.  We still had the energy to do more so we decided to tackle Ilchulbong, or more commonly known as Sunset Peak.  Sunset Peak is a MASSIVE volcanic crater rising up right next to the town, and its steep jagged cliffs plunge directly into the cold grey sea.  Halla Mountain is the principal volcano which formed Jeju and is centred right in the middle of the island, but throughout Jeju over 360 smaller parasitic volcanic cones are found.  Sunset Peak is one of these many smaller volcanoes that once fed off of Halla Mountain, and definitely the most beautiful of them all.  A trail leads up to the crater's edge, and we were eager to climb to the top.  It took about 45 minutes or so to climb up to the top of Sunset Peak, and the views while climbing rewarded us with breathtaking sights of the town below, the waves crashing into the shore far down below, and a sweeping vista of the whole eastern half of the island - I could see at least another seven volcanoes dotting the landscape!  WOW!  When we finally got to the top we both just stopped and stared at the magnificent sight that lay before us - an absolutely massive volcanic crater completely filled with the greenest, lushest grassy alpine meadow that you can imagine.  The crater is shaped like a giant punch bowl and its rim is guarded by jagged rocks which stare down at the five or six lonely trees that grow in the crater.  The whole top of the volcano has a very 'Jurassic Park' feel to it, like as if you sat still enough you could see a pod of Brontosaurus' trek through the crater or that a Pteradactyl would swoop down from above.  Amazing!  It was definitely a view I'll never forget as long as I live.  After our hike up Sunset Peak we ventured down to the small beach that is wedged beneath the volcano's peak, just under the cliffs of the island.  The beach is made up entirely of pure black volcanic sand and giant chunks of rogue lava pieces the size of Volkswagens lie scattered in the sand along the far end of the beach.  And all through the cliffs dozens, if not hundreds, of caves beckon into the dark stone - like blackened swiss cheese that could be the gateway to hell - very menacing looking!  These caves are apparently home to hundreds of thousands of bats.  Andrea and I were hoping to see some bats but we had no luck there.  We even ran around the beach screeching in the highest frequencies we could create with our human voice boxes in an attempt to draw our nocturnal flying mammal friends out of their cliff-side condiminiums, but it was to no avail.    We returned to town to have some very greasy fried chicken for dinner, and then went back to the motel room to gorge ourselves on cookies and watch TV.  We were pretty exhausted from our long day so we went to bed fairly early.  What an amazing, incredible day!!!

      Today was our last full day that the four of us got to spend together ('The Core Four' as we describe ourselves!)  It was again really hot and humid outside - this certainly encourages lethargy and can make it hard to be motivated to do much or go anywhere.  We slept in really late today and were sooooo sloooooow in getting ready to head out into Seoul.  Soooooo lazy we were!  We went to Insadong and had lunch at Spaghettia.  Once again Koreans' version of 'meat-free' meals strikes again!  I ordered a linguine dish (on the menu this came with a meat or no meat option) and was disapointed to see when it arrived that it still contained little itty bitty pieces of beef in the sauce.  I guess the menu should read "Some-Bits-Of-Meat-Snuck-In-Linguine" and "Lots-of-Meat Linguine"!  I was super excited today cause we were going to see THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW!  I've been waiting to see this movie for like six months and finally my day had come!  We bought tickets and went and enjoyed the movie.  It was awesome!!!  Hail ripping apart Tokyo! Tornadoes clear-cutting Los Angeles!  Tidal waves washing over and drowning Manhattan!  There was disaster and destruction left right and centre and I loved every minute of it!  It was sort of a 'check your head at the door' kind of movie (but aren't all disaster flicks?) but it was entertaining and exciting regardless!  Unlike typical disaster movies, this one actually had a message though which was cool - take care of Mother Nature or she's gonna get real pissed off and cause a global ruckus!  It was great fun anyways - bring on the disaster flicks!!!  After the movie we (of course) went and had ice cream at Ben & Jerry's, which the Core Four unamimously agree is far more superior than BaskinRobbins!  (Unfortunately there is only one Ben & Jerry's that we know of in Seoul, whereas there are BaskinRobbins on EVERY corner in the city.)  After ice cream Brad and Andrea went and did some shopping in Insadong while Steve and I headed to Kyobo to hang out in the bookstore.    We had a quiet night at home tonight.  We just ordered some pizza and hung out at Brad's for a while watching TV.  We went to bed pretty early because Brad and Andrea had a bunch of packing and cleaning to do, and Andrea and I were getting up early the next morning to head out on my trip to Jeju Island.  Steve and I played more trivia then went to sleep.

      Wow am I ever behind on my blog!!!  It's gonna take a while to get it all caught up - this last week has been so busy!  But be patient my precious bloggers - good things come to those who wait!  ;-)  Steve, Brad, Andrea and I were going to go camping this weekend, but instead we decided to just do a day-hike.  We really hadn't planned out the details for camping at all, and plus it was so hot and humid outside that we didn't feel like dragging tents and stoves and all that other camping gear up the mountain!  We took a bus over to Bukhansan National Park and started up the trail.  This was supposed to be a leisurely, relaxed hike but it was a lot more gruelling than we thought it would be!  It was quite steep in a lot of places and the trail we took went up and over a big mountain peak providing astounding views of the forest and city below.  It was SO HOT outside that Andrea and I really didn't think we were going to make it when we first started out, but we soon got into the groove of things.  It was a five-hour hike and probably the most scenic one I've been on yet.  Brad found a really gawdy, hideous-looking picture/clock frame made up of sea shells by the side of the road at the beginning of the trail and thought it would be funny to drag it along our entire hike so we could take silly photos all day long.  The picture was quite large and cumbersome and I didn't really believe that he was going to haul that ugly thing up and over the mountain, but the boy did!  We took lots of hilarious photos with us and the photo in all kinds of silly poses - too much fun!  We got a lot of strange looks from Korean hikers who were passing us, that's for sure!  Early in the hike we also came across a field of rice paddies with some cut-outs of Communist soldiers for god knows what reason placed throughout the field (target practice? a sober reminder of what dangers lies just a few kilometres north at the border? Korean-styled-scarecrows to keep the birds away?  Who knows!)  This was way too good to pass up so we took more silly photos of us with the cut-outs, and Andrea even filmed a hysterical video clip of me sexually-harrassing/dry-humping the Commie soldier.  ("What's that you fuckin' Commie?  You don't fuckin' like democracy?  Well here's what I think of your fucking Communism!  Ughh...take it bitch!  Who's your daddy!?  Yeah bitch, democracy always wins out!  Take that, you fuckin' Commie!)  Yes it was completely un-PC and perhaps rather insensitive to all our Communist friends out there (I really don't have a problem with Communism - honest!) but it was really funny!!  I guess you had to be there?  The view of the city from the mountain peak was absolutely breathtaking!  Bukhansan is right at the edge of the city and so from the top of the peaks you can see the entire city sprawling out below.  It was so surreal - from high up Seoul looks like SimCity!  Rows and rows of apartment towers spreading out in infinite direction, with freeways snaking through the labrynth of streets below.  Astounding!  It looked like Seoul was a 'sea of city' washing up against up the slopes of the mountains, as if the tide had just come in and was now going out...  It's really hard to do it justice with words.  After our hike we went to LaFesta and had a yummy dinner at TGI Friday's.  Then we went back to Brad's to hang out for a bit and relax after our physically-active day.  I ended up crashing at Steve's instead tonight and him and I stayed up late quizzing each other with trivia cards from Trivial Pursuit.  Since Andrea has to leave back to Canada next week Steve is now officially my future partner on The Contenders.  (No word yet on a film date - stay tuned!)  All in all, a great day!

      It was my last day of teaching today at my school here in Korea.  I am now officially unemployed and living in a foreign country - crazy!!!  It was a sad day at work, saying goodbye to all my students at the end of each class.  I don't think the younger ones really get it that I'm going and not coming back...they'll definitely clue in though when they don't see my face around there for a while!  My older kids were so sad to see me go!  They all gave me big goodbye hugs and I had brought my camera so we took a bunch of photos.  At the very end of the day, when I went to go leave, the kids didn't want me to go, so they were doing everything possible to keep me there.  They stole my shoes, hid my books, and blocked the doorway so I couldn't exit!  It was really cute and sweet to see how much they care about me.  They're great kids and I'm really going to miss them.  I wish them all the best in their lives.  I told them I'd come back and visit sometime, which I do hope to do sometime once I get my new job worked out.  I have some news on the job-searching front - I have a job interview already!  The one school in Seoul that I was interested in wants to have a phone interview, however, they want to have it on Saturday!  I told my recruiter that I was going to be out of town until Wednesday night and apparently the school doesn't want to wait...  I'm kind of annoyed that they gave me less than 24 hours notice for a job interview, and that they can't wait like only few more days, especially considering that the job doesn't start until July.  Whatever.  I booked the trip before I found out about the job interview, so if I lose this position I don't really care.  There's plenty of others out there - if I don't get this position I know there'll be others I can apply for.  Like I said earlier, I'm willing to be patient and hold out for a really good job.  No more bullshit!    Brad also put in a good word for me at his school, and he says there's going to be some openings very soon at his campus.  However, I don't really want to work way out in Ilsan.  I know that it's a great school and an awesome company to work for, but I really REALLY want to get a job in the city.  I hate commuting, I hate suburbia, I hate being so far from all the cool stuff in the city.  If Brad, Andrea & Steve were going to be in Ilsan for a while longer I'd take it, but Brad and Andrea leave next week, and then Steve leaves in July, so what's the point if none of my friends are going to be around out there?  Brad's gonna check and see if there's any openings at a Poly school in Seoul so I have my fingers crossed for that one.    Brad invited me to come check out his school tonight after I got off of work.  Unfortunately, that didn't happen.  It took me much longer to get out to Ilsan than I thought it would (2.5 hours from my house!)  By the time I got out there it was too late to see the school and I was in SUCH A BAD MOOD.  Between being frustrated over being unemployed and job-searching (I hate job-searching) to the heat and humidity to spending two and a half hours on the subways in rush hour and then getting to Ilsan too late, and being really hungry, I was feeling really *really* cranky.  Fortunately the good company of my friends put me in a much better mood, and plus I was really excited about the weekend plans.  We had a late night dinner at LaFesta, and then rented a movie (Cold Creek Manor - a bad movie - don't bother!) and then went to bed.

      So the ball for me finding a new job is well in motion!  I called a recruiter reccommended to me by my friend Gavin this morning and she was great!  She was super friendly and knows of some upcoming jobs in Seoul that will be hiring very soon.  She's also going to put my application in for 100 VERY LUCRATIVE teaching positions at elementary schools, beginning in July.  Yes, that would mean teaching at a REAL SCHOOL!  They're the kind of jobs that a foreigner would sell his own mother for so it'll be very competitive to get one of those positions.  Here's hoping I do!  (And don't worry Mom, I've no plans to put you up on e-bay anytime soon!)  hehe!  All of the positions she mentioned sound attractive - I'm going to be a bit more fussy this time around in selecting a school and location.  I'm a 'seasoned veteran' now and know how the system works so I feel pretty confident I'll get a good job soon.  And I can afford to wait a little while for a good one to come up.  I'm definitely willing to be patient.  I told my kids at school today that I would be leaving very soon.  At first they didn't seem to understand that I was going to be leaving *and not coming back* but then they finally got it.  They all seemed very sad (my older kids did anyways) and a couple of them even wrote me little goodbye letters in class today.  THEY ARE SO SWEET!!!  Here are the letters that I received today, written exactly as they are in the note:  To Scott  Hello? Scott  My name is Cherry Scott.  biy-bay Good boy Scott  Verry hansom Scott ~ I am crying  - Cherry -  To: Scott Scott! Hi.  My  name is James. Scott is school English Teacher Bye-Bye :-( GoodBye Scott is Good boy very good Boy Scotty bye-by Scott Teacher my very very sad :-( - James -  To: Scott Scott, Hello? My name is Debbie. Scott, Monday bye bye! I'm verry verry sad! :-( Scott, bye bye Scott, (below in giant letters) I *heart* you - Debbie -  How cute are my kids!!  Doesn't that just make your heart melt???  I'm really gonna miss them...  After work today I sent off my resume to two other recruiters that friends reccommended to me so we'll see what they come up with.  I've now got THREE recruiters working for me so I'm pretty sure that by the end of next week I'll either have an interview or a solid lead on a specific job.  Things often work really fast around here so I don't think I'll be sitting around my apartment for ages and ages.    In the meantime, I've decided that a little holiday is in order.  This weekend I am going camping at Bukhansan National Park with Brad, Andrea and Steve.  We actually have had this planned for quite a few weeks as it is the last weekend that the four of us get to spend together as both Brad and Andrea leave next Thursday.  I'M GOING TO BE SO SAD TO SEE THEM GO!!!  The four of us have been inseparable since March and I can't imagine my life here in Korea without them.  We all connect SO WELL, much more so than I have with my other friends, and it's going to be impossible to replace them.  But, such is the life of an expat.  People are constantly coming and going so as someone who's planning on spending the next couple of years teaching and travelling overseas I better get used to goodbyes.    As for my holiday, well next week Andrea and I are going to go to Jeju Island for a few days!!!  She really wanted to go and check out Jeju before she left but didn't have anyone to go with.  Well suddenly I have a lot of free time on my hands, and I've been wanting to go to Jeju so I thought why not???  We're gonna leave on Monday and come back on Wednesday so it's just a short visit but it's going to be great.  It's supposed to be stunningly beautiful there (it's a subtropical volcanic island about 85 km. off the south coast of Korea - you have to fly there) and it'll be great for 'bonding time' between me and Andrea before she leaves me to go back home.  So basically starting this weekend I'm travelling for the next 5 days - WOO HOO!!!  *(expect the blog to be quiet for a while!)*  Mark phoned me up tonight to see if I wanted to join him for dinner so I said 'sure!'  (Mark's the American guy who lives near me who I just met the other day.)  We ended up having quite the long night tonight!!!  We went to this restaurant/bar just behind Kolon-Mart for some dinner and a couple beers.  Well we were sitting outside on their patio when these two middle-aged Korean guys came up and joined us at our table.  They wanted to meet us and practice their English, and they both seemed friendly enough so Mark and I were cool with it.  They ended up staying quite a while and we all kept ordering more and more beers, trading language lessons and just talking about life in Korea and stuff.  Well they were so nice that in the end not only did they pay for the whole bill (including our dinners!) but they also invited us to their respective homes for dinner in the future.  KOREANS ARE SO FRIENDLY AND HOSPITABLE!!!  :-)  They left us around 10pm or so and Mark and I thought this was going to be the end of it.  Well they came back about 5 minutes later and insisted that we follow them down the street.  Just half a block down was some bar that had just opened and was having a freebie OPEN HOUSE so they wanted us to join them at this new bar.  We ended up having more beers and some platefuls of snacks, ranging from dried cuttle fish to watermelon to banana chips to almonds to squid tentacles.  We all stayed there for a good hour plus and had a great time just chatting it up.  After we left there and said our goodbyes, Mark wanted to pop in at *another* bar just up the street to visit a friend of his (ie: a girl he's trying to pick up...hehe!)  So it was another drink at another bar and more cool Koreans to chat with.  This night just kept going and going but it was all great fun.  Mark and I are becoming good buddies already, and I'm getting to meet lots of cool people in the area in the process.  Too bad I'm going to be leaving Shihung so soon! (words I never thought I'd say!)    I got home just after 1am feeling a little tipsy (but having spent nothing as the Korean guys and then Mark paid for everything!)  Tonight was sorta like my pre-weekend celebration/kick-off to what I know is gonna be a really really awesome 5-day stretch.  Be prepared for lots of great stories when I get back (and some breathtaking photos, as well, I'm sure!)

      I've got some news, and you better sit down for this one, although you probably won't be all that surprised when you hear it...  As of this Friday I'm UNEMPLOYED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Yes, I've lost my job here in Korea, it's official!  My worst case scenario that I was worried about a month about has come to life.  My school is totally broke and cannot afford to keep me on payroll.  I'm too much of a drain on finances and they have to let me go.  My last day of teaching is the end of this week.  That's it, I'm done.    Since I sorta saw this coming, it hasn't been all that much of a shock.  I thought that maybe things had stabilized at my school but apparently not.  In the middle of a class today Steven pulled me aside and we had 'the chat.'  He seemed really sad about it though and I know that he honestly feels bad about having to let me go.  He's actually already found me a new teaching job, but I'm not going to take it.  It's in a city called Cheungju and it's way out in the middle of nowhere central Korea.  Steven says it's only an hour or so on the bus into Seoul, but still, I've had enough of suburbia.  I'm going to look at this as an opportunity to find a new, way better, way cooler job, in a nicer part of town.  Something that's actually in Seoul-proper and doesn't involve having to spend hours and hours on the train and bus to get anywhere!  So yeah this means big changes in my life, that's for sure.  I'm definitely going to stay here in Korea though.  I'm really enjoying my time here, have made some good friends, and frankly, the money is too good to walk away now.  Schools are constantly hiring so I feel pretty confident that I'll be able to find a new one fairly soon.  I called all my friends tonight and they're going to talk to their bosses and check around to see if they know of any openings.  It's all about connections, and the fact that I'm already in Korea (therefore saving a potential employer from having to pay to fly someone in) will work as a huge advantage for me.  And plus now I'm a bit of a 'seasoned veteran' - I know what to look for in terms of both job qualities, and which areas of town are nice to live in.  I'm hoping that by the end of next week I'll have found something new.  I went up to Steven's apartment tonight and we chatted more about the details.  He feels really REALLY bad about having to let me go and actually started to cry at one point.  He said "I'm sorry" no less than a thousand times tonight and is going to do his best to help me find a new job.  There'll be complications with Immigration and work visas and all that other bureaucratic bullshit that I'll have to deal with at some point but he's going to take care of as much of it as he can.  He also said that I can stay in my apartment as long as it takes to find a new job so that's really cool.  I also have a bit of savings in my Korean account so I'll be fine with $$$ for a while.  At least I know I won't be out hungry and homeless on the streets anytime soon!  ;-)  I guess all of this news is really unsettling and means a lot of work for me to find a new equilibrium for my life here in Korea, but I'm sorta almost happy about it too.  I mean Steven and his family have been super nice to me and I couldn't ask for a kinder family to work with, but the school was kinda shitty.  It was very poorly run, completely unorganized, I never got paid on time, and I live way out in a shitty run-down suburb that no one's heard of.  Finding a new job will hopefully give the opportunity to find steadier, more stable employment in a nicer area of town.  I'm determined to get out there and find myself a kick-ass job!  It's gonna be a crazy, hectic, at-times-stressful next couple of weeks.  Wish me luck!

      So just when you think you've got your own neighbourhood all figured out, a few surprises pop up that totally make you realize that you really don't know what, or I should say who, is in your area of town after all!  I've been living here almost four months now and thought that I knew about all the foreigners who live in my area, cause there sure aren't that many!  There's myself, crazy Charles, boring Glenn, and the two really nice girls I met a few weeks ago - Ailish and Anne.  I've never ever seen any other foreigners in my area, so I just assumed that we were the only ones.   Well I got an email the other day from a guy who came across my blog online, who happens to be an American English Teacher who lives here in Shihung like right across the street from Kolon-Mart!!  WOW!!  Someone in MY AREA who I've never ever seen!  Us white boys really don't blend in here so I was pleasantly surprised to find out there's more potential friends out here.    And then the other day I was walking into said Kolon-Mart to buy some groceries and out walked a very lovely middle-aged blond woman!  I did a total double-take as she walked by and said hello to me, and then she was gone again before I even knew it.  Where the hell did she come from???  Does she too live somewhere in my little corner of suburbia and our paths have also never crossed?  So strange!  Well I chatted with the new American guy the other day on the phone and he seems like a cool guy.  We went and hung out tonight and had dinner at Pizza Hut, and then went out for drinks at Halloween and then another bar called Texas.  He's really friendly and we seem to have a lot of the same interests, and best of all he actually seems NORMAL!  After meeting crazy Charles and boring Glenn I've been really skeptical and suspicious about other foreigners but luckily the last couple ones I've met, including Mark (the American guy) have been really cool people.    But it totally makes me wonder...who else is hiding here in Shihung?

      Today was such a great day!  We all woke up fairly early, beacuase it's damn hard to sleep in a tent when the sun comes up, and it gets really hot early.  By 9am it was already close to 30 C outside and I also recall, at around 5am or so when I went pee, that nearby there are a lot of...roosters??  haha!  Okay...  Not the sound you'd expect to hear around here!  We made a really yummy breakfast, and then headed down to the beach for the day.  We then proceeded to spend *the entire day* down at the beach!  Myeongsa isn't the nicest beach I've seen, but it's not crazy crowded like most beaches are in Korea, and is really pretty.  The weather was HOT HOT HOT today and I absolutely loved it!  The rainy season has ended in Korea and now it's nothing but clear blue skies and SOARING temperatures!  They're expecting the hottest summer in over 50 years in Korea and I believe it!  It had to have been close to 40 C today...  We alternated between swimming and sun-bathing and it was great just to relax all day and read my book.  We only got up when we wanted to swim, or wanted a snack or drink, and it was awesome!   The only downside with all this was that Brian and Pauline ended up getting quite the nasty sunburn!  We made some pasta diner back at camp and then went back down to The Strip for beers.  We all got drinks and then watched a most breathtaking sunset over the offshore islands in the distance.  Crimson and gold and orange and magenta and danced and flowed across the horizon and we all just sat in peace and awe.  After the sun went down we went to a local store and hung out on their patio tables all night long.  We drank our beer and played Scrabble and Crib while enjoying the warm ocean breezes.  Man, life as a beach bum rocks!!

      Today was Total Transportation Day!  I woke up at the oh-so lovely hour of 5-fricken-AM (yeah, I'm not much of a morning person!) and got all my gear together and went and met up with Brian.  We caught the bus to Seoul Station and then strolled into the KTX Train Terminal to buy tickets for the high-speed train to Busan.  Our plan was to get onboard the 8am train but it was completely sold-out!  We instead bought tickets for the 9am train and went and had some coffee and breakfast to kill time.  Soon it was time to board the train and we were totally excited for the trip!  Boarding the KTX feels like you're boarding a plane!  The train terminal has very airport-terminal kinda feel to it and it was all hustle and bustle this Monday morning.  We got on board the train and a few minutes later we were pulling out of Seoul.  This is the second time I've ridden the KTX (the first time was back in May when me and the gang went to the Green Tea Festival/Temple Stay) and it was just as enjoyable and comfortable this time.  The train ride, even while flying through the countryside at 300 km/hour, is as smooth as silk.  You never feel any push or lurch when the train is accelerating or slowing down.  Train travel is such a romantic way to travel.  Watching the lush green hills and rice paddies roll on by, flying through town after town, soaring across rivers and through tunnels, onwards sailing towards your destination afar.  I love it.  In just three short relaxing hours, we crossed the entire country of Korea and arrived in Busan.  Busan is Korea's second largest city ('only' 4 million peole live here) and is the nation's largest port.  Busan has a very lovely location, nestled between its jagged harbour and the dramatic green hills that hug the urban sea.  It has a flavour and atmosphere very different from Seoul, and is a gateway to many other places in Korea, including where we were going. on this trip - Geojedo Island.   We took a cab to the ferry terminal and bought tickets for the next ferry to Geojedo.  We had time to kill and were starved so we had some lunch at the cafe in the terminal.  I don't think many foreigners roll through here often because the staff there seemed pretty excited to serve two weguks from the city!  It was then time to board the boat - the Democracy 1 - our link to the island.  Brian and I only had very basic directions from Pauline on how to get to the island and so far we hadn't had any problems.  Because they were already on the island, we had to give them a ring when we got onto the island to get further directions.  It was a pleasant 50-minute ride on the boat through Busan's busy harbour and then out into the open ocean - Korea's South Sea.  We sailed into Janseungpo and I could tell already that this island was spectacularly beautiful!  It was peaceful and quiet and had a beautiful, dramatic coastline - soaring cliffs and towering green mountains!  Wow!  Geojedo is the second-largest island in Korea (after Jeju) and is still fairly pristine because of its remote location.  We rang Pauline on her cell (yes, cell phones work *everywhere* in Korea) and she gave us another long list of directions on how to find them!  Turns out they were camping on Myeongsa Beach - the last beach to be found at the very bottom of the island.   We caght a local bus, one that only travels a couple times a day, and cruised on down the coastal road that hugs the breathtaking shoreline of Geojedo.  We passed through many a fishing village on the way down the island.  The waters of the sea were pure blue and it was great to be out in the forests of the island.  About half way down the island the bus stops running at the coastal resort village of Hakdong, and so we had to catch a cab from there.  We had a hard time finding a taxi in this village but eventually we did and rode on down to Myeongsa.  We finally arrived at Myeongsa Beach at around 4pm - wow - ten hours of travelling today!!  Bus, train, taxi, ferry, bus, taxi...  It doesn't get much more remote than this in Korea!  And it was well-worth the journey!  Myeongsa was quiet and splendidly devoid of crowds.  A good-sized crescent beach in a small harbour surrounded by massive green forested mountains - the perfect place to spend a couple days camping!  We met Pauline and then were introduced to Nick and Angele - a really nice couple from Canada who have just returned to Korea for another teaching contract.  The three of them led us down the strip of stores and restaurants located just off the beach to our camp site - a rather remote location in itself!  There are no formal campgrounds in this part of the island - so we made our own!  Up top a rather steep and high ridge over-looking the bay they had found a clearing in the forest - the perfect place to set up camp - away from the beach-goers.  We set up our tent and then we all made some dinner.  The stores below provided us with some basic groceries for our meals so we didn't have to hike in food from afar - very convenient.  We then went and bought some beer and hung out on the beach for the night.  We laid in the sand and talked into the wee hours of the morning, enjoying the solitude and feeling quite small in the world under a quilt of starry night.  So beautiful!  A warm breeze blew in from off the water and it totally felt like paradise!  Ahhhh... now *this* is an ideal vacation!

      I've decided that for my summer vacation I'm going to join Pauline and a couple of her friends on a camping trip in the south of Korea!  Brian, who works at Poly Juyeop, is going to come along as well and the two of us are going to meet Pauline & Co. down there.  The three of them left yesterday morning and so Brian and I will make our way down tomorrow AM.   One things though - neither Brian nor I own any camping equipment!!  That could pose to be a *slight* problem if we're going camping!  hehe!  I know that Namdaemun Market has a street full of stores that sell camping gear so we decided to make our way there and do a little shopping.  We caught the bus and in no time flat were at Namdaemun.  We browsed through a couple of stores and were pleasantly surprised to find everything at a realy cheap price!  He had bought a tent already, so we each bought a sleeping bag and mat, cooking gear, and a propane gas stove.  We got it all for a good deal and were quite pleased with ourselves.  It's gonna be a really fun trip!!  I haven't gone camping yet in Korea and am looking forward to escaping the city for a while and enjoying some of Korea's beautiful scenery.  After shopping we headed back to Ilsan, had some Korean dinner, and then went home to bed.  It's going to be an EARLY RISE tomorrow (5am!) and so we should try and get some sleep.  On a different topic, if anyone's curious, you can now watch me and Steve's performance on The Contenders on the web!  It's really easy and I'm sure you're just *dying* to see it!  hehe!

      Ahhhh...the first day of a 9-day *paid* holiday!  Sweet!!  I had made plans to take a bus down to the city of Chungju to hang out with my buddy Luke for the day, and so I had to wake up at a half-decent hour, even though I totally felt lazy and wanted to sleep in til like noon!  I caught the subway and had a looooong ride to Express Bus Station which is in Seoul on the south side of the Han.  I found the bus terminal a-okay and bought a ticket to Chungju.  What a deal - 125 km. ride and it only costs 6000 Won!  My bus was even leaving in 15 minutes so I didn't have to wait around long.  It was a madhouse at the bus terminal though.  Today is the first day of summer holiday here in Korea and it seems like *everyone* wants to get out of the big city.  The bus ride ride to Chungju was cool and comfortable - thank god for AC!  It was only an hour and a half ride and I was so very thankful that there's bus lanes on the highway!  Traffic was way backed up and in the first half hour on the bus I saw four car accidents on the highway!  What the hell!  Slow down everybody!  Koreans can be pretty crazy drivers and I know that during holiday times everyon'es just so anxious to try and get ahead of the pack.   I stepped off the bus in Chungju and was welcomed by a wave of disgusting humidity!  Holy fuck!  Seoul is humid but I soon learned from Luke that Chungju is officiall the humidest (not a word, I know) city in Korea because of its central location - not near the ocean and totally boxed in my hills that trap the hot air.  Lovely!  Luke toured me around the neighbourhood a bit and it was interesting to see what Chungju looked like.  For those of you who remember, this is the city that my old bastard boss Steven wanted me to live in after I first lost my job.  Looking around at the place, I'm damn glad that I didn't take it!  Not that Chungju is necessarily a *bad* place tro live, I just know that I'd be bored stiff and that I'd be much happier in Ilsan (which I am!)  Luke's friends Ryan, Juanita, and Jeff later rolled into town and the five of us went and saw Fahrenheit 9/11!  *WHAT A GREAT FILM!*  It should come as no surprise at all that I loved the movie and was thrilled to see many of my own opinions/criticisms regarding President Bush and the War In Iraq put so succintly and eloquently and vividly shocking into a 2-hour film.  For those of you who haven't seen it, GO!  Every single American, in  fact, really needs to see this film.  Yes, Michael Moore is biased, but he doesn't pretend to be.  I think that there's a lot of information in this movie that many Americans aren't fully aware of, and with this being an election year, eligible voters should try and become as educated and involved as they can.  There were many saddening moments for me in the film, particularly with the interviews with the families who've lost sons and daughters in the war, as well as the horrifyingly graffic images of war-torn Baghdad.  Wow.  I'm still reeling from it all...  After the movie we went to Luke's broom closet of an apartment to hang out for a bit, and then Ryan, Jeff, and Juanita headed out back to Ryan's town.  I stayed in town a bit longer and had dinner with Luke.  We went to Pizza Hut and had a great time just relaxing and chilling.  Turns out my buddy Luke has a lot in common with me, ranging from leftist political leanings to a love of Coldplay and other Brit rocks bands!  Hooray for good friends!  I then got back on teh bus and made my way home.  It was a really nice bus ride actually, just watching the dark countryside flow by with great tunes on my head phones.   I love being so mobile here in Korea.  It took almost 3 hours to get home but it was a fun day for sure.

      In the last five months of teaching I've had the opportunity to get a really detailed look into what Korean kids are like, and be able to compare them to Canadian kids.&nbsp; There are a tremendous amount of cultural differences between the two groups of kids, and I've had to adjust my teaching style/approach to learning because of this.&nbsp; I could make an eighty-page list on all the differences - some being quite subtle, some incredibly profound - between Korean and Canadian children but I won't get into that now.&nbsp; Today was a day when it was really proven to me that at the end of the day, kids are still just kids, and often aren't all that different, really.  Today was the dreaded Test Day for all my older kids, and just like Canadian kids, they HATE this day and get so stressed out about it!&nbsp; The pressure to do well in school is a thousand-fold for Korean kids than what it is for Canadian kids, but it was interesting to see them try and cram for it just like kids back home would do.&nbsp; The same jitters, the same sweaty palms, the same moaning to the teacher as soon as I handed out the exam booklets.&nbsp; Korean kids learn in a lot of different ways from Western kids (example: memorization of facts vs. understanding of concepts) but when it comes to disliking tests, they're all the same.  The other example that made me laugh out loud actually occurred just before exam time began.&nbsp; About 15 minutes before the afternoon classes started today, the power went off on our floor.&nbsp; The school was plunged into relative darkness and the temperature began climbing immediately without the powers of air conditioning to keep us cool.&nbsp; Apparently this was caused by an over-usage of power by our school, but it was how the kids reacted to it that made me smile.&nbsp; As soon as the lights went off they all became excited over the fact that maybe their exams would be cancelled (this would be a student's dream come true, to have their exam cancelled just 15 minutes before test time because of a power failure!) and started to get very excited.&nbsp; Then they all began running around the school hallways, 'oooohhhhhing' as they pretended to be ghosts!&nbsp; They made the same silly haunted house sounds that we all used to make as kids in school when the power went off!&nbsp; This is one cultural icon that I honestly didn't think would transpire over here but sure enough, when it comes to power outages and haunted houses, kids will be kids!&nbsp;   The power inevitably did come back on in time for all the classes to write their exams, and it was such a slack day for me.&nbsp; Basically all I did was baby-sit my kids as they wrote their exams, and it was such a nice way to end my week and begin my vacation!&nbsp; After the tests I said goodbye to all my students and even though our break is only a week long it seems like it'll be a long time before I see them again.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to the break anyway and plan on enjoying my mini holiday here in Korea!

      I had a really easy morning today!&nbsp; I only had one class to teach because this morning all the pre-schoolers got to go on a field trip!&nbsp; There's five classes of pre-schoolers at POLY and we were all going on a tour of a fire station in nearby Hwajeong!&nbsp; COOL!&nbsp; Field trips were always the best when you were in school, and now that I'm a teacher, I have to say that they haven't lost their lustre!&nbsp; There's something just really exciting about being able to go somewhere together as a class, and maybe it's just the fact that you're missing regular classes!&nbsp; haha!  Each class has their own giant van to drive them around and so me and all my Parrots (each of the pre-school classes are named after a bird!) climbed on into the van and drove to Hwajeong.&nbsp; We watched Lilo & Stitch along the way and same more kids songs.&nbsp; Good times!&nbsp; When we got to the fire station the kids' level of hyperness reached into the stratosphere and it was quite the effort for all us teachers to keep them together! We all sat down in this one room and watched one of the firefighters show the kids all the different equipment they use.&nbsp; The demonstration was all in Korean so I didn't understand a word they said, but it was cute just to see all their eyes light up at seeing all the cool firefighting gear.&nbsp;   We then watched this fire safety video that was absolutely hysterical, but I don't think it was meant to be funny!&nbsp; It had this Korean anime fairy character flittering around an apartment building watching as the silly Koreans in the video set their house on fire cause they were stupid enough to leave the iron on and then leave the room!&nbsp; This giant scary evil fire monster then jumped out and burned everything (again, all anime) but it made all the kids scared and they jumped every time they saw the fire monster!&nbsp; There was another scene in the video where some kids playing with dynamite (what the fuck?&nbsp; where'd they get that from?) accidentally burn down a whole apartment block!&nbsp; Too funny!  My afternoon turned out to be a fairly non-teaching day as well.&nbsp; We're starting level tests today and it's a pretty important exam for all the kids to take so for most of the day I was just supervising my classes as they wrote the test.&nbsp; What an easy-breezy day for me!!&nbsp; (and I've got all my report cards done, finally!!)&nbsp; Summer break is almost here - I can taste it already!&nbsp; :-)

      I got up at the crack of dawn this morning after sleeping on Michael's couch all so that I could endulge in a little special breakfast.&nbsp; Now what on Earth can you imagine that would be enough for me to want to go to such lengths all for just one measely meal of the day?  WESTERN-STYLE BREAKFAST!!!  OMG!&nbsp; Michael told me that the USO has a cafe that serves up Western-style breakfast for Western-prices and I was already salvitating at the chance to get in on that action!&nbsp; Since I've arrived in Korea I've been CRAVING, in ways that you can't even imagine, omelettes, hashbrowns, pancakes, french toast, and all those other goodies.&nbsp; I used to LOVE going out for brunch on the weekends with all my pals back in Vancouver and this is the kind of food that you just can't find in Korea - anywhere!&nbsp; I was totally stoked for this breakfast!!  Now this is where I become highly hypocritical and I'll be the first to admit it.&nbsp; I may be&nbsp;uber-critical of the American military, but I'll become a dancing, drooling, fool just to be able to eat at their USO cafe.&nbsp; The USO (I don't even know what it stands for) provides many kinds of services for the Armed Forces here in Korea, mainly in the form of cultural tours and organized events, but their Western-style cafe is just one of their other features.&nbsp; And surprisingly this is something that is open to everyone - not just military folk.&nbsp;   We headed down to the USO office and us three weguk boys were thrilled to have the breakfast!!!&nbsp; I had a cheese omelette with juice and toast and it only cost me three bucks!&nbsp; AND IT WAS SO YUMMY!!!&nbsp; In all honesty, the omelette itself wasn't even that spectacular, but just the fact that I had been without it for so long made it taste that much better!&nbsp; We all wolfed down our breakfast and sighed in great pleasure after it was all done.  And not only that, I even got to go into their little store at the USO and buy a Snapple Iced Tea and three ENGLISH magazines!!!&nbsp; I'm a mag addict and have also been in English-magazine withdrawal since arriving in Korea!&nbsp; I bought myself a Vanity Fair and Details magazine, and those combined with the latest GQ that Chris had brought me from the States, and I was happier than a pig in shit!&nbsp; I had a full happy tummy and plenty of English reading material!&nbsp; God bless the USO!&nbsp; And yes, once again, I'll admit how dumb I sound for being so happy to be able to buy such things, courtesy of the American military, when two minutes later I'll be criticizing their practices around the world.&nbsp; (Sometimes I just can't help myself.)&nbsp; But can you blame a brother?&nbsp; ;-)  I went back to work and bragged to all of my co-workers about my morning.&nbsp; They were all super jealous over the breakfast that I had, and everyone fawned over me because of the magazines!&nbsp; I was certainly a popular fellow at POLY this morning!&nbsp; Hehe!&nbsp; It's funny how happy one can become by just the simplest things!

      After work today I headed straight for the subway and rode the train to Insadong to meet up with some friends for dinner.&nbsp; Michael's brother Chris was in town visiting from Iowa and Mikey was having a little dinner with him, Eric, and myself.&nbsp; We all met up in Insadong and then went and had a delicious chicken dinner at a Korean restaurant.&nbsp; I don't remember what the dish was called, but it's a special dish that Koreans traditionally have on the first day of summer, which is today, July 20th.&nbsp;   It was really cool to chat up Chris and hear all about his first impressions of Korea.&nbsp; Korea is almost always a bit of a shock for those new to Asia, or those new to anything outside North America, really!&nbsp; To hear about all the things that a weguk who's Fresh Off The Boat notices first is always fascinating, and it's cool to be able to compare it all to your own first impressions when you arrive.&nbsp; The size of the city, the endless rows of high-rise apartments, the crowds, the traffic, the dirtiness, the Korean language and writing...those are most commonly the first things someone who's new notices.&nbsp; Chris is in town for a week or so before him and Michael fly off to Cambodia to check out the sites there.&nbsp; It's gonna be a great trip for both those boys.  It totally made me wish that I had some of my family come visit!&nbsp; I'm such a long ways from home and I would absolutely love to have my parents or sister in town and be able to show them around and introduce them to life here in Asia.&nbsp; I know that it would be a HUGE SHOCK to their system but that it would also be a really educational, eye-opening experience for them.&nbsp; It would give them an appreciation for all the challenges that I deal with here, and it would also allow me the chance to show off all the wonderful things that Korea has to offer.&nbsp; I know that a lot of the times they'd be overwhelmed, mostly with the crowds, the heat, and the traffic, but I think it would be a great visit nonetheless.&nbsp; Too bad that it costs a fortune to fly to Korea from&nbsp;North America!&nbsp; Even for my sister, who's already much closer by living in Vancouver, it would still cost a lot of money for her to visit.&nbsp; I wish that I was rich and could fly them all over and give them a fabulous tour.&nbsp; Plus the fact that by the time I come home it will have been two full years since I had seen my family last really makes me wish that we had the means to visit.&nbsp; Even just one visit between now and then would be nice to have some family time together.&nbsp; Ahhh well, looks like we'll just&nbsp;have to stick with the&nbsp;ol' blog and phone to stay in touch!  After dinner we were all feeling kinda mellow so instead of going out&nbsp;for drinks or whatever we decided to take Chris to our favourite board game cafe to play Risk.&nbsp; Yeah yeah&nbsp;yeah, we've been over the whole Geek thing already - enough with that!&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; We ordered&nbsp;pizza and played Risk for a while and had a really good time.&nbsp; After that I went and crashed at Michael's&nbsp;so that I could have breakfast with them the next day before heading off to work.&nbsp; It was going to be a special breakfast and I was quite excited about it.&nbsp; Excited enough that I was willing to sleep on a couch and then wake up at 6:30am all to have this breakfast...&nbsp; And what breakfast would that be?&nbsp; You'll have to read about it tomorrow!&nbsp; hehe!&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I have a room-mate, and his name is Dmitri.&nbsp; Now he's not another foreign English Teacher, he's a beautiful little maroon Samurai fighting fish.&nbsp; He was originally Brad's pet (and then Steve's for a while) but I inherited/adopted little Dmitri when I took over Brad's apartment.&nbsp; He's been great company and the ideal room-mate.&nbsp; He's a great listener, doesn't make much mess, doesn't give me any attitude or lip, puts up with my really bad singing as I get dressed in the morning, and is always so happy when I feed him.&nbsp; (If only all roomies were like this!)  I've always liked fish actually, and I've enjoyed having him in the apartment with me.&nbsp; I think he's kinda mad at me though right now, and that *may* have to do with the fact that I almost killed him tonight...&nbsp; Oops!&nbsp; ;-)  I had to clean his bowl and in order to do that I had to remove him and put him in a small cup of water while I cleaned out his little round home.&nbsp; Not wanting to refill his bowl with gross Seoul water, I had bought a big jug of spring water to give to him once it was all cleaned out.&nbsp; The problem was that it was way too cold to put him back in yet (the jug was in the fridge) so I had to make him wait a while in that little cup while the water returned to room temperature.  Well Dmitri, like his owner, doesn't have much patience and hates to wait.&nbsp; I was on the computer when I heard this little *bloop* noise....&nbsp; Not thinking it was anything, I continued with my email until I realized, "OMG!&nbsp; What if that noise was Dmitri!!!"&nbsp; I ran to the kitchen and his little cup was empty!&nbsp; Where was Dmitri???  I looked down in horror into my kitchen sink and saw my little friend - swimming in a disgusting fesspool of bacteria water in a kitchen pot, leftover from my pasta sauce that I had made three days earlier!&nbsp; Oh Dear God - Poor Dmitri!!!&nbsp; I scooped out my little purple companion, scolded him gently, and placed him back in the cup.&nbsp; I guess the sneaky little bastard decided to show me up by giving me a scare!&nbsp; Cheeky bugger!  A few minutes later I had him back in his clean home, and he swam around in happy circles.&nbsp; But he hasn't looked me in the eye since that day though, and gives me the silent treatment every time I try to talk to him.&nbsp; I keep telling him that if this relationship of ours is going to work, it takes a lot of open, honest communication, but he's a stubborn prick and won't open up at all.&nbsp;   *sigh*&nbsp;   Does anyone know how to help make a feisty fighting fish forgive you?

      OMG, today had to have been one of the best days I've ever had!!!&nbsp; :-)  We slept in quite late today, and then changed right back into our suits to go and have a day full of good ol' fashioned fun in the mud!&nbsp; They had all the same activities set up today as there was yesterday, only today the weather was even nicer!&nbsp; It was warm and sunny and there were actually blue skies all day today - something that I haven't seen in ages it seems!  We made a b-line to the mud pit, and this is where things got *real dirty*, or maybe I should say Dirrty?&nbsp; Once again we shyly stepped into the pit and waited to see how long it would be before we got attacked by the muddy geurilla warriors that inhabit the mud pit!&nbsp; Michael and Eric got picked off first, while I just stood off to the side laughing my head off at them!&nbsp; My peaceful cleanliness did not last long though...  I was just standing there when this girl in&nbsp;a bikini came up to me (and she couldn't have been more than 5'5" in height) and said "Hey you!&nbsp; You're way too clean to be in here!"&nbsp; She then proceeded to PICK ME UP, throw me over her shoulders, and then slammed me into the mud, throwing herself on top of me!&nbsp; Oh my!&nbsp; She pinned me down while she threw mud all over me, and then all of her friends and everyone else in the ring ran up and before I knew it tsunamis of mud were washing over my body, trapped under this firey muddy pixie!&nbsp; Woohoo!! The next hour or so was like a scene out of a naughty music/soft-porn movie!&nbsp; Guys and girls wearing only their bathing suits&nbsp;tackled each other in a no holds barred/winner takes all wrestling match!&nbsp; I spent more time rolling around in the mud with bikini-clad girls and board-short guys, none of whom I had ever met before, grabbing and groping and trying desperately to stay on top of the seething mass of muddy human flesh that seethed and writhed every which way, than I can even describe!!&nbsp; It was like Christina Aguilera's "Dirrty" video come to life!&nbsp; (aka: My Dream Come True!)&nbsp; ;-)  After our mud wrestling matches, in which I lost horribly each and every time, we decided to spend the rest of the day on the beach.&nbsp; The summer heat was glorious and this was the nicest beach I've seen yet in Korea.&nbsp; Clean, smooth, soft white sand.&nbsp; And the waters were SO WARM!&nbsp; We spent a good three hours or more swimming and playing and horsing around in the waves of the Yellow Sea and I don't think I've ever had that much fun in the ocean before!&nbsp; It was awesome!&nbsp; The afternoon just flew by and we didn't want to leave - this was true summer paradise!&nbsp; Unfortunately, if we wanted to get home at a half-decent hour, we had to hit the road...  And it's a good thing we did cause even with our semi-early departure it took *forever* to get home!&nbsp; The drive from Boryeong to Seoul, when there's no traffic, is only 2.5 hours long.&nbsp; Today it took us SIX HOURS to get home!&nbsp; Ugh!!!&nbsp; We even got off the main freeway (which was more like a parking lot) and took smaller secondary highways to get away from the crowds, but it still took a long time to get home.&nbsp; Ahhh well, that's the reality of living in a crowded country!&nbsp; We got home around 10pm or so and I then had to subway it all the way back home to Ilsan.&nbsp; I went to sleep that night still feeling like I was bobbing in the waves.&nbsp; What a wonderful day - if only every day was a Mud Festival Day!&nbsp; :-)

      This was one of my best weekends ever here in Korea!!!  Michael, Eric, and I decided to take a road trip down to a small city called Boryeong to check out its annual Mud Festival!&nbsp; That's right, you heard it - an entire festival devoted to the joys of mud!&nbsp; Now how cool is *that!*  We left Seoul around 10am and hit the highway that led south down to the Central-West Coast where Boryeong is.&nbsp; As usual, with it being a festival weekend, traffic was quite bad trying to get out of the city.&nbsp; For a good hour or more we just crawled along at 10 km/hr. stuck in a giant freeway of clogged traffic.&nbsp; Traffic finally got moving about half way into our journey.&nbsp; We decided to stop at this small town for lunch along the way, and also to buy a car stereo!&nbsp; Michael's tape player had broken on our last rafting trip and the three of us were going stir crazy without any music to bop along to on our trip.&nbsp; We picked up a cheap CD player, had it installed in less than half an hour, and then were back on the road with tunes cranked the rest of the way!  It was late afternoon by the time we arrived in Boryeong but things were still a hoppin'!&nbsp; There were crowds all over the beach and plenty of muddy passerby!&nbsp; Oooh this looks like it's going to be a fun weekend!&nbsp; We found a fairly inexpensive motel to stay at near the beach, (with a *round bed!*) got changed into our suits, and then made our way over to the beach.&nbsp; It was quite the spectacle when we arrived!!  The Boryeong Mud Festival really is just that - a festival that's all about mud-filled activities and fun stuff to do all involving mud.&nbsp; There was mud-wrestling, mud slides, mud volleyball, mud soccer, mud face-painting and body art, mud facials, mud massages...&nbsp; You name it, if it can have&nbsp;mud in the middle&nbsp;then it was going on!&nbsp; Apparently in this part of Korea the mud has a lot of healing minerals in it or something (there's also a whole line of cosmetics in Korea that's made with this town's mud) and so the town has just turned it into an annual party.&nbsp; At least 80% of the people at this festival were foreigners and it was so cool to see hundreds and hundreds of whiteys running around screaming covered in mud!  The most fun is your first 'Mud Initiation!'&nbsp; Us&nbsp;three boys had shyly stepped into the big mud pit (surrounded by a giant inner tube lining that could bounce off of) and were a little reluctant at first as to how to 'get dirty'.&nbsp; Fortunately, the other 30 or so people in the ring made that decision for us!&nbsp; We were tackled and dragged into the centre of the ring only to have every single person in the ring run up and throw and kick mud all over us!&nbsp; In only five short wonderfully frantic seconds, where you're screaming like a 7-year old girl who's just stepped on a piece of seaweed, while laughing uncontrollably, you become absolutely covered in mud, from head to toe.&nbsp; Literally your *entire body* (including my precious hair!) becomes caked in mud!&nbsp; AWESOME!!!  Luckily Boryeong is located right next to Daechon Beach, easily one of Korea's most beautiful beaches.&nbsp; You can get all dirty and muddy and then run across the soft white sand into the ocean to clean off, only to start all over again!&nbsp; The festival has a real party atmosphere with everyone drinking and running around chasing each other half-naked.&nbsp; And I ran into so many friends!&nbsp; I ran into Joanne, Ailish, and even&nbsp;four of my POLY coworkers!&nbsp; It seems like every foreigner in Korea was here at the Mud Festival!  That night was really fun too.&nbsp; They had free rock and pop concerts at a giant stage set-up right on the beach, and then a spectacular fireworks and laser show!&nbsp; After that it was one ginormous beach party all night long!&nbsp; The three of us stayed up til like 3am just hanging out at the beach having way too many beers and watching all the antics around us!&nbsp; There was drunken wrestling matches on the beach, bongo drum jam sessions/sing-a-longs, chicks running around in bikinis giggling Valley-girl giggles, and the proverbial jock guys skinny-dipping in the sea.&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; Where am I?&nbsp; Korea or 'The MTV American Spring Break in Cancun'???&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; It was an amazing night just to hang out and take it all in.&nbsp; A warm breeze blew softly through the air and it was so nice just to be outside in the fresh ocean air.&nbsp; Ahhhh...this is the life!&nbsp;

      Thank God it's Friday!!!&nbsp; It's been a good week at work, but I'm still getting adjusted to the very long hours.&nbsp; On M-W-F I work from 9am-7:30pm and on T-Th I work from 9am-6:40pm.&nbsp; Whew that's a lot of hours!&nbsp; However, the job is fun and the school is good and the pay is great so I'm not complaining at all.&nbsp; It just takes a little while to get used to working such long days....  On top of that, I've been so bogged down with report cards lately!&nbsp; Once a month we have to write report cards for all of our students and it's quite a lot of work.&nbsp; Altogether I have about 100 students that I'm responsible for and let me tell ya that's a lot of fuckin' report cards to write up!&nbsp; It's kinda funny, I actually feel like a *real* teacher now with this new job.&nbsp; Proper curriculam and organized teaching and report cards and everything!&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; And the fact that I don't even have a teaching degree kinda makes me laugh, I'm just a 'teacher-come-lately' here in Korea.&nbsp; It's pretty cool though - I really do enjoy the profession.  Tonight after work was The Viewing Party - Take 2! and I had my fingers crossed that Steve and I were going to be on air!&nbsp; Most of my friends who came out for the party last week unfortunately couldn't make it out this week so it was a much smaller get-together.&nbsp; Plus Rick & Tracey had moved back to Canada so there goes my orginal venue!&nbsp; Kelsey has the channel so I went and watched the show with her, Peter, and Rochel (all Poly teachers!) and it was a blast!  When the show came on and we saw Steve and I walk out onto stage we all just *SCREAMED* out in excitement at the TV!&nbsp; haha!!&nbsp; It was so funny and so weird and so surreal to see myself on television!&nbsp; Of course everyone always hates how they look and sound on camera so I was totally self-conscious but all my buds said I looked good and was well-composed.&nbsp; Again, none of them knew if we were going to win or lose so it was exciting to watch it all play out.&nbsp; We all erupted in cheers again when we won the show and then I had to explain to them that this would be the one and only time I'd be on the show because of the situation with Steve.&nbsp; (and it's too bad that Stevie never got the chance to see himself on TV either.)&nbsp; Everyone was super-impressed that we had won and so now I've got a rep as a pretty darn smart boy with game show winning credentials behind my name now!&nbsp; hehe!  (Let's hope it all doesn't go to my already big fat head!)&nbsp; ;-)

      So I was seconds away from buying myself a plane ticket to the Philippines today!  Summer Break is at the end of this month and I was thinking that it would be really cool to go somewhere for it.&nbsp; We only get two weeks off a year so our holidays are really precious to us foreign teachers!&nbsp; We only get a week off in July and a week off for Chritmas (other than a few other long weekends scattered here and there because of Korean national holidays) so you really gotta take advantage of that free time!&nbsp; Pretty much all of my co-workers have booked trips for themselves and I didn't want to be left behind in Korea for a whole 9 days with all this free time and nothing to do and no one to hang out with!  Six of my coworkers are actually going to Thailand (the destination of choice for foreigners here) and a couple are going to China.&nbsp; I thought that the Philippines would be really cool because unlike Thailand and China, it's not part of my Great Backpacking Trek that I have planned for myself next year when I finish my teaching contract.&nbsp; I also have a few friends who've gone to the Philippines and absolutely loved it!&nbsp; And hey who wouldn't want a whole nine days to lounge around on a beautiful tropical beach?&nbsp; I sure would love it!!  I looked into going to Boracay which is a tiny island in the Philippines and has been voted by a number of travel magazines and experts as The World's Most Perfect Tropical Island.&nbsp; It's only a few kilometres long and is virtually all white sand and palm trees, with turquoise waters and little beach huts to stay in.&nbsp; No cars are allowed on the island, and there's supposed to be some great restaurants and bars there.&nbsp; And the scuba diving/snorkelling is *legendary*!&nbsp; God it totally sounds like paradise to me!!&nbsp;   However, as cheap as travel is in Asia, it still would've cost more than I would've liked, mainly because I'd be booking it last minute.&nbsp; So reason and sensibility won over adventure and wanderlust today, but I made a deal with myself.&nbsp; No big trips this vacation (I have only just returned to work after being unemployed for a month) but instead I'm gonna look into going to Boracay for my Winter Break.&nbsp; How awesome would it be to spend Christmas and New Year's on a spectacularly gorgeous little white-sand palm-tree aquamarine-waters tropical island!!!&nbsp; Maybe I can even convince a few friends to come along with me...?  Consider this an open invite to all of my friends to come and join me this Holiday Season for a week in paradise!&nbsp; Any takers???&nbsp; :-)

      I have to say it, and I have to say it loud and clear!&nbsp; I want the whole world to know that,  I LOVE KIMCHI!!!  Wow, never did I ever imagine the day that I'd say that would come!&nbsp; When I first arrived in Korea I thought that kimchi was the most disgusting thing that I had ever seen!&nbsp; For those of you who aren't familiar with it, kimchi is fermented cabbage (although it also comes in a variety of other vegetables too.)&nbsp; It's soaked in spices and is fermented in giant jars FOREVER before it's taken out and eaten.&nbsp; It's cold and wet and looks gross and soggy.&nbsp; Red goopy sauce drips off of it and it has a smell that could knock a sailor to the floor!&nbsp; And it's *definitely* an acquired taste!  I wouldn't touch the stuff for months when I first arrived.&nbsp; I just looked at it and turned up my nose.&nbsp; But then one day I was feeling brave and decided to taste a bit.&nbsp; It certainly wasn't a love at first bite, but I was suprised that it didn't taste all that bad.&nbsp; And somewhere inbetween then and now I've been transformed into a Kimchi-lovin' Canadian Boy in Korea!&nbsp; I just can't get enough of the stuff!&nbsp; And luckily for me kimchi is served with *every* Korean meal so I get to have it often.&nbsp; Kimchi is Korea's most popular and most famous food (it's just a side-dish, not a meal in itself) and I'm head over heels!&nbsp;   Not only that, I have to say that I think I've become a bit of a kimchi connosseur! (sp?)&nbsp; I've had so much of it that I feel that I can now easily tell the difference between good, mediocre, and bad kimchi.&nbsp; Texture, degree of spiciness, size of pieces, amount of sauce, how long it's been fermented, crispness...all are all various&nbsp;kimchi qualities that can make it or break it and I've gotten really good at judging all of them.&nbsp; And trust me, there really are subtle but significant differences in the&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;kimchi that you get served when you're out and about in Korea!&nbsp; I know my kimchi!&nbsp; Yum yum yum!  God, what's gonna happen when I leave Korea?&nbsp; I'm totally gonna go thru Kimchi Withdrawal!!!&nbsp; Egad!&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp;

      Okay, you know you're a pre-school teacher when you find yourself singing kids songs when you're at home, on the bus, walking down the street, shopping....&nbsp; And I can't help it!&nbsp; I catch myself donig it *all the time!*&nbsp; I just can't get the songs out of my head!&nbsp; haha...  We listen to many kids songs during class time on a very regular basis.&nbsp; I put the music on for the kids during activity time (the singing along while they work&nbsp; helps to keep them behaving and focused on their schoolwork, I've found) and so I'm exposed to it on a regular basis.&nbsp; On top of that, every Friday during fourth block all the pre-school kids gather together in the school library and we all sing songs together.&nbsp; The teachers get up on stage and lead the kids in the sing/dance-along and I have to admit it's actually kinda fun.  Well now this exposure to all of this kid music has been overflowing into my 'non-work life!'&nbsp; The music has totally seeped in and taken over my brain!&nbsp; Like for example, this morning I was in the shower and wasn't just signing, but *totally rocking out* to 'Skip To My Lou'!&nbsp;   "cat's in the cream again, what'll I do?&nbsp; Skip to my lou my darling..."  "fly's in the buttermilk, shoo fly shoo!&nbsp; Skip to my lou my darling..."  Oh dear!&nbsp; ;-)  And the other day I was in the grocery store in the produce section browsing through the fruit stands.&nbsp; I came across where the apples were and suddenly, blaring through my head, and then softly out of my mouth, (without realizing it at first) came the Apples & Bananas song.&nbsp; You know the one, it's the song where you change the vowel sounds...  "I like to ate, ate, ate apples and bananas...  I like to eat, eat, eat eeples and benenes...  I like to ite, ite, ite ipples and bininis...  I like to ote, ote, ote opples and bononos...  I like to ute, ute, ute upples and bununus...!"  I CAN'T STOP!!&nbsp; SOMEBODY HELP ME!!&nbsp;   It's funny anyways.&nbsp; Like I said, you know you work with children when....hahaha.&nbsp; Maybe I should start up a local 'Kids Songs Addicts Annonymous' support group?&nbsp; I could easily recruit all of my co-workers to join.&nbsp; We could have weekly therapy sessions!&nbsp; ...&nbsp; LOL!  ;-)

      As some of you may have heard by now, I've been having a lot of problems with my blog over the last couple of weeks.&nbsp; This started back when I was in Shihung and it wasn't until today that I found out what's been going on.&nbsp; My problem is that I haven't been able to read my own blog!&nbsp; I can access my blog via the blogger site, and I can write my entries, but I can't actually go to the site and view it like you can.&nbsp; Every time I try the computer just waits and waits and eventually an error/time-out message pops up.&nbsp; What the...???  When this first started happening I asked a few people around the world if they could still read my blog.&nbsp; Everyone could - all across Canada and the US and even my buddy Ryan in Taiwan...but nobody I knew in Korea (incl. myself!) could read it!&nbsp; Okay this sounds very suspicious...&nbsp; Why would the rest of the world have no problem reading my blog, but nobody in Korea can?&nbsp; What's up?  I had no idea what was going on until my co-worker Peter filled me in.&nbsp; He has a blog on blogger.com as well and had been having the same problem as me.&nbsp; Well he wrote blogger support and they emailed him back and filled him completely in.&nbsp; Here's the scoop - (and I was quite shocked, but at the same time not really, when I first heard why...)  The Korean government has completely blocked all access/viewing privileges to the blogger site by anyone and everyone in the country.&nbsp; Why you may ask?&nbsp; This is all because of an event that took place in Iraq a few weeks ago&nbsp;that caused massive ripples across Korea in various ways...  A few weeks ago a Korean worker in Iraq was captured and threatened to be killed unless the Korean government pulled out all of its troops from Iraq.&nbsp; The Korean government refused and as a result the man was beheaded on camera.&nbsp; His death is just one of the many beheadings that have been taking place in Korea but it came as a horrific shock to the country.&nbsp; All of Korea went into shock and mourning over the man's death (his name was Kim Sun-Il I believe) and the media jumped on top of it and ate it up like candy.&nbsp; It was all over the news and everywhere you went it was all you heard about.  Well the video footage of his beheading obviously made it onto the internet and was soon being viewed by various individuals across Korea.&nbsp; The Korean government had already banned this footage&nbsp;and photographs from being aired on TV/printed in the&nbsp;papers&nbsp;and did not want Koreans seeing it so they shut down every single website that tried to display it.&nbsp; In the middle of this frenzy, there was someone who had a site on blogger who decided to post photos of the beheading on their blog, and this pissed off the Korean government.&nbsp; In retaliation, they blocked all access to not just his but ALL blogs in the country to stop this.&nbsp;   This totally fucking pisses me off!&nbsp; And for several reasons!&nbsp; Firstly, it's annoying that I can't even access my own damn blog.&nbsp; I can write in it, but can't read my entries unless I go into 'edit' mode on the site from within the control panel.&nbsp; This event took place over a month ago and the sensationalism that surrounded his beheading has come and gone already.&nbsp; Why should the government still block it?&nbsp; Exactly for how long are they planning on keeping the blockade up?&nbsp; Will I not be able to read my own blog for the rest of the time I'm in Korea?  Secondly, what kind of so-called democracy goes to such lengths to censor the media, in all forms (television, newspapers, the internet, etc.) in order to prevent images which it deems not suitable for its citizens.&nbsp; What happened to making up your own fucking mind about what's appropriate for one's own self to see?&nbsp; I'm terribly sad to hear about this innocent man's death, and have no urge myself to view the footage, but I don't agree with the government deciding what I can and cannot view.&nbsp; This censorship is something that I would expect in a country like China or Cuba, not in a nation that claims to be modern and cosmopoiltan and open to new ideas and influence from the outside world.&nbsp; Is this disgusting behaviour just Korean's past as The Hermit Nation rearing its ugly head again?  And thirdly, I find it entirely hypocritical of the Korean government to do this.&nbsp; Just a week or two before Kim Sun-Il's beheading, two Americans were beheaded and the footage of their deaths did not get censored at all.&nbsp; In fact, they had the footage being aired on the 6 o'clock news for anyone and everyone to see!!!&nbsp; So, in other words, it's completely okay and appropriate for anyone to see two Americans getting beheaded (including children who could be watching such regular evening programming) but not if its a Korean?&nbsp; Why should those two Americans not be extended the same respect and dignity as Kim Sun-Il?&nbsp; (Not that I support censorship at all, but their argument has no grounds at all if they pick and choose based on nationality like that.)  It's fucking stupid!  I'm trying not to be the judgemental foreigner here, but it's been a huge inconvenience for me and I'm finding it impossible to understand or respect this government decision.&nbsp; Arghh!!!!&nbsp; Anyway, at least now I know why I've been having so many problems with my blog!&nbsp; But who's to say when it will actually end?&nbsp; I just may have to get used to this situation - shitty!  &nbsp;

      We woke up early this morning and us three boys drove on out to the Hantang River, the same river canyon that we had visited with Maeve about a month ago.&nbsp; Because Korea has been in the full swing of Monsoon Season, the river should be much higher and therefore rafting should be much more fun!  And when I say Monsoon, I really mean it!&nbsp; An insane amount of rain has fallen in Korea over the last few weeks!&nbsp; I knew that summer was the Rainy Season but they should rename it The Great Annual Deluge cause I haven't seen this much rain in a long, long time!&nbsp; And it ain't no constant drizzle - when it rains it POURS and there's often huge thunderstorms along with it.&nbsp; The thunder and lightning are cool but not when enough water to fill the Great Lakes falls on Korea every single day...&nbsp; The weird thing is that despite all of this rain we're still suffocating in humidity here!&nbsp; It's very odd being outside and it's raining cats and dogs yet you're still sweating buckets because the humidity is like 96%!&nbsp; Crazy country!&nbsp; :-)  When we got up to the river we were not disappointed!&nbsp; The river was ROARING through the canyon and we could actually see real white water where rocks and boulders had been before.&nbsp; Awesome!&nbsp; Accompanying this were literally *bus-loads* of of Koreans who were arriving to partake in the same activity as us!&nbsp; Looks like the three of us aren't the only ones today who though it was a good day for rafting!  Our afternoon cruise down the river turned out to be a total blast!&nbsp; We had lots of great rapids and it was a completely different experience from just a month ago!&nbsp; Before we kept getting stuck on giant rocks and having to carry our raft through rapids, but certainly not today!&nbsp; A few times we were totally slammed against the water and all had to hold on real tight!&nbsp; AWESOME! It was a beautiful warm day and we did some swimming in the quiet parts of the river too.&nbsp; It only took about an hour and a half to do our rafting run today - exactly half the time it took the first time!&nbsp; We all had a great time and plan on doing rafting at least once more this summer (but we'll probably choose a different river next time, just for the sake of variety.)  After that it was time to head back into Seoul again - just a short day trip out for us.&nbsp; Naturally traffic was backed up coming into Seoul and so it took twice as long to get back into the city as it did to get out.&nbsp; Ahhhh, the joys of weekend traffic while living in a megacity!&nbsp; I had a splitting headache though and my ears thought they were going to explode....&nbsp; I think I got a bunch of water in my ears when we were cliff-diving and it was like how it feels when you're in an airplane and you CAN'T clear the pressure in your head.&nbsp; Seriously, I thought my ears were going to bleed!&nbsp; Finally about 2 hours later they suddenly cleared and I felt SO RELIEVED to have my hearing&nbsp;back, and for losing the desire to want to have my head run over by a squid truck!&nbsp; LOL!  By the time I got back into Ilsan it was quite late and I was ready for bed.&nbsp; Back to work tomorrow for my first full five-day week of teaching!

      Another busy day for me...&nbsp; It was Saturday and I *so* wanted to sleep in but, alas, not today young, fair Scotty....&nbsp; I had to get up at the crack of dawn (well, 8am, which is too damn early to be up on a Saturday!) so that I could be driven to the Immigration Office to get my new Alien Registration Card.&nbsp;   My Director Chang picked me up at 9am along with Charles and Peter who also work at Poly and we made the big trek out to NE Seoul which is where the nearest Immigration Office is.&nbsp; It was a quick and easy-breezy visit fortunately.&nbsp; Right in, right out, and everything was a-ok.&nbsp; All our paperwork was perfect and we could pick up our new cards next week.&nbsp; Sweet - the final, last step for my new life in Korea is&nbsp;at last&nbsp;complete!  We then went back to Ilsan and I hung out with Steve while he packed up all his gear.&nbsp; In only a few hours Steve was gonna get picked up and driven to the airport so he could start his next adventure.&nbsp; Although I was totally excited for Steve and his trip (6+ months trekking across Central Asia!) I was really sad and depressed to see him go!&nbsp; Steve has been a great friend to me since I met him through Brad a few&nbsp;months ago, and has become an even closer bud since Brad and Andrea departed in early June.&nbsp; What was once&nbsp;The Core&nbsp;Four was whittled down to the Hotboyz and now I was going to be the only one left...&nbsp; After today my three bestest buds would all be gone and who knows when I'll see them next.&nbsp; Leaving your friends&nbsp;is really no fun at all,&nbsp;but being the one 'left behind' even more so.&nbsp; I hate goodbyes - they totally suck!!!  The afternoon disappeared in an instant and it was time to bid my friend Bon Voyage.&nbsp; Kelsey and I gave Steve a big hug and then he was gone...&nbsp;   After that Kelsey and I decided to go and do a little shopping in Namdaemun Market in Seoul.&nbsp; Kelsey's leaving in a few weeks herself to go on a 3-week African Safari with her father and needed to pick up a whole shitload of gear for the big trip.&nbsp; We made our way to the insane and wonderful chaos that is Namdaemun and actually had a blast picking up all her items.&nbsp; Kelsey and I are always ridiculously silly whenever we're together and we were having way too much fun with ourselves while shopping!&nbsp; Good times!&nbsp; She managed to get most of the gear she needed and then I had to head out to meet up with Michael and Eric.  Michael and Eric had invited me to go white-water rafting again tomorrow so we were going to have dinner together and then I'd crash at Michael's so that we could get up early to make the drive north.&nbsp; I subwayed it to Itaewon and the three of us had a really lovely dinner at quiet and relaxing French restaurant.&nbsp; After dinner we cabbed it over to our favourite board game cafe and played...you guessed it...Risk!&nbsp;   The three of us are such huge geeks!&nbsp; Here we are, on a perfect Saturday night, and we're *excited* to go and sit and play a silly board game for all hours into the night!&nbsp; LOL!&nbsp; But hey at least we're self-professed geeks, which makes it half cool!&nbsp; hehe...&nbsp; We had the biggest, bloodiest match of Risk yet and I ended up winning by a hair.&nbsp; Yah, me!&nbsp; It was a great night just chilling with friends and actually most of today was a good reminder that even though the Core Four are No More I still have a lot of great friends here in Korea!&nbsp; Lucky me!&nbsp; :-)  &nbsp;

      So I was totally excited all day today!&nbsp; Today was Friday and the night of my big debut on television!&nbsp; It was the night that my episode of The Contenders was going to be aired across Korea - *nation-wide!* and I was totally stoked about it!&nbsp; How cool would it be to see yourself ON TV!!!???&nbsp; haha!!  Because of this pivotal moment in my life, the exact moment when I instantly transform from humble English Teacher to international superstar extraordinaire, I naturally wanted to share it with absolutely everyone I knew in Korea!&nbsp; Steve and I decided that a Viewing Party was in order and that we would gather up all our buddies to come out and watch our stellar performance on TV together.&nbsp; None of our friends knew if we had lost or won cause Steve and I wanted to build up the anticipation and watch it all unfold on TV...it's gonna be a great night!!!  I don't even have the Arirang channel in my apartment, but Rick & Tracey who live below me kindly offered to host my little soiree.&nbsp; I made a million phone calls and then waited and watched as the crowds rolled in...&nbsp; There was Steve and myself, Kelsey, Ben, Pauline, Rick, Tracey, Michael and Eric drove in from Seoul, and even Mark and Ailish bussed in all the way from Shihung.&nbsp; What a great turn-out!  With about twenty minutes or so left before the launch of my Career In Fame a TV commercial for the show came on that quickly caused me to have a short panic...&nbsp; It was showing glimpses of the upcoming episode...and none of them had Steve or I in it!!&nbsp; Uh-oh...&nbsp; Could it be that tonight's episode is actually the one that was filmed on the same day as ours, just before we competed?&nbsp; Nahhh....we were told by the Arirang staff that *tonight* was gonna be our night...  Oh boy...  11pm hit and we all crammed into Rick & Tracey's place and had our eyes glued&nbsp;to the tube.&nbsp; The show rolled out, the music started up, the host walked out on stage and introduced....  ...not Steve and I!  DOH!!!  Uhhhhh sorry guys...looks like Steve and I are actually gonna be on TV *next week!*&nbsp;   (insert sheepish grin and nervous giggle here)  No worries, everyone was a good sport about it.&nbsp; We all just laughed about the circumstances (Murphy's Law eh?) and enjoyed the show.&nbsp; We had some beers and had a blast jeering the other contenders, knowing that whoever won that show would be our competition.&nbsp; It was great fun and actually a really awesome impromptu party at Rick & Tracey's.&nbsp; This was actually the first time ever that I've had all my various groups of friends here in Korea together in one room!  After the show we just hung out and chatted for quite a while, and then some of us went for drinks later on.&nbsp; Steve and I were teased incessantly about the little 'schedule mix-up' tonight but it was all in good fun.&nbsp; Looks like we'll have to reschedule the Viewing Party for next week!  &nbsp;

      I have a horrible habit that I've been trying to break for nearly 26 years now.&nbsp; It takes constant effort and continual reminders, but I have greatly improved at it.&nbsp; Still, I'm a long way from where I want to be.&nbsp; It'll probably take the rest of my life to get to that ideal point, and even then maybe not.&nbsp; The only comfort with this menace is that I&nbsp;know (or am just assuming/hoping) that I'm not alone in this condition.  &nbsp;  My horrible habit is that I tend to live my life in the future, and not in the present time.  &nbsp;  Let me explain...  &nbsp;  For as long as I can remember, I have been a 'planner.'&nbsp; No, I'm not talking in the urban/cityscape sense this time, I'm talking with just planning for where I want my life to go next.&nbsp; I've always been busy with looking ahead&nbsp;and am constantly thinking of where I want to be and how I can get there.&nbsp; Call it ambition, call it pro-activeness, call it avoiding the present, call it whatever you want.&nbsp; But either way I've always had my eyes on the future - what I'll be doing tomorrow, next week, next month, next year, and sometimes even 3-5 or more years down the road of life.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  This, in many ways, has been a great blessing.&nbsp; Ever since I can remember I've always known exactly what I've wanted to do in life, and pretty much every major goal I've ever set for myself I've been able to accomplish.&nbsp; I'm proud to say that right now at this very moment I am living the life I had always dreamed about.&nbsp; No wait, let me rephrase that...I am living a life that's *even better* than what I could have fathomed.&nbsp; I truly am a very lucky guy in that respect.  &nbsp;  On the other hand, this near obsessiveness with always calculating my next move in life comes with a heavy curse.&nbsp; I find it difficult, at times, to just 'enjoy the moment' and feel that I spend far too much time planning for 'what happens next.'&nbsp; Instead of just letting myself go by living completely in the present and enjoying all the fruits of my labour and just stopping to celebrate and just BREATHE, I refuse to let myself do so.&nbsp; It's like I've crafted the art of planning out my life to such a degree that I've lost all ability to live in the now.&nbsp; (Well maybe not *all* ability, my life *is* full of innumerable amazing moments that I truly do appreciate *at the time*, but not as many as I would like.)&nbsp; What is it about me that just won't allow myself to let go, to relax, to take a break from this chess game of life philosophy, from this self-imposed addiction, from this all-consuming hypnotic trance of living life&nbsp;dans&nbsp;la&nbsp;future?&nbsp; My feet may standly firmly and confidently and proudly in the present, but my head, way up in the clouds, lies in days yet to come.  &nbsp;  It really bothers me, at times.&nbsp; Again, I have to re-emphasize, it's not that I'm unhappy with the present, it's just that I can't seem to NOT be constantly looking ahead to what is yet to come, planning and preparing and getting ready for whatever goal or project or phase I've set for myself next.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, all the while in high school all I could think about was what life would be like when I got to BC and was in university.&nbsp; My&nbsp; high school days were awesome, really fun, care-free, adventurous, healthy and happy, yet all I could think about was SFU.&nbsp; And then when I was in university, all I could think about was what kind of career/travelling I would be doing once I graduated.&nbsp; My university days were the best days of my life, I loved my school, had more friends than I knew what to do with, and was living in the&nbsp;most beautiful city in all the world.&nbsp; And yet then I was still always looking ahead.  &nbsp;  And now here I am, in 2004 and nearly 26 years old, having the ultimate adventure of a lifetime in Korea, but yet it's a constant battle to not keep thinking 24/7 about my backpacking odyssey across Asia I'm planning once I finish teaching here, as well as my teaching adventures in Prague that I've got planned.&nbsp; Ahhh, my curse keeps on going!&nbsp; As long as I'm still alive will this always be how I am?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  And talk about presumptious!&nbsp; How do I know I'm even going to get that far?&nbsp; I could die tomorrow from an aneurism or&nbsp;from being run over&nbsp;by a car or from severe food poisoning by extremely bad kimchi!&nbsp; Who's to say how long my life will be?&nbsp; How egotistical and over-confident of me to feel so sure that I'll still be here tomorrow.&nbsp; A long time ago I remember seeing a quotation on the bedroom door on my good friend Benoit.&nbsp; I don't remember exactly how it went (and it was also in French) but it roughly said something like 'You are so confident and so sure of your life, you who cannot count on a single day.'&nbsp; It really struck a chord with me then and it's another incentive and reminder now of why I need to work on living in the present.  &nbsp;  Because it's so true!&nbsp; *Now* really is *all* that we have.&nbsp; The past doesn't actually exist anymore - it's just a collective memory in our complex, fragile&nbsp;brains.&nbsp; And the future doesn't have any physical tangibility to it at all - it's merely just a hopeful concept.&nbsp; This exact moment is all that I'll ever have and I really should do more to be thankful for it and to soak up every single microsecond of its infinite wonderfulness.  &nbsp;  Is this complex of mine one that was genetically pre-determined, as in it's just 'who I am' and that I never really had a chance to fight it, or is there more to it?&nbsp; Is it culturally and socially-instilled in me from birth?&nbsp; Have I been programmed to live my life in tomorrow instead of today?&nbsp; I did a paper once in university about the different ways that cultures 'deal with' time and it was quite fascinating.&nbsp; I can't get into all the details now, but basically the conclusion was that cultures that don't take time so seriously (prime example - Latin cultures) live, on average, much happier and much more stress-free lives than cultures that obsess and agonize over the clock (prime example - Canadian/American culture.)&nbsp; Every time I think about this issue I keep going back to the lessons learned in that paper.&nbsp; It really does seem like our culture brain-washes us to live such lives.&nbsp; Why do we do this to ourselves?&nbsp; Is it really that important to be such obsessive organizers and planners, to have every minute of the day mapped out in our own little agendas?&nbsp; To need to have everything happen exactly on time or heaven falls apart?&nbsp; To be prisoners of our own clocks and alarms and schedules and wrist-watches?&nbsp; Our timeliness and efficiency and organization may be spectacular, but at what cost to the rest of our&nbsp;lives?  &nbsp;  But I'm not here to point fingers or to make up silly excuses.&nbsp; I'm just trying to figure myself out.&nbsp; Which, at times, can be the hardest thing in the world to do.&nbsp; At least I've identified one of my own greatest personal challenges (that's half the struggle!) and am prepared and willing to take it on.&nbsp; I don't exactly know what to do about it - it's like trying to rewire my brain, but I really do want to improve.&nbsp; My life is too damn amazing to just ignore it as it flows right on by!&nbsp; And who really knows when it'll be gone?&nbsp; I'm blessed enough to have 26 years of wonderful and amazing memories.&nbsp; It's time I switch from just relishing my precious memories and worshipping my (not-so) secret ambitions and start soaking up the today.&nbsp; 'Life is now', and that's gotta be my new everyday philosophy.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      One of the coolest things about Seoul is that you can buy food just about anywhere, anytime from one of the city's many many streetside stalls.&nbsp; The cityscape is covered in literally *thousands* of them and basically any street that has regular foot traffic will have at least one (but usually where there's one, there's a good 247!)&nbsp; This means that at pretty much any given moment one is able to purchase a super-greasy snack wherever one feels like it!&nbsp; This is something that apart from the odd hot dog stand, is completely non-existent back home.&nbsp; To arrive and see all the major streets of Seoul turned into a giant food court is definitely one of the most noticable differences in life here in Korea. &nbsp; The food is always inexpensive (never more than a couple dollars) and a whole lot of them seem like they never, ever close (well, all the ones near nightclubs anyway!)&nbsp; I tell ya, there's nothing quite as satisfying/disgusting as coming out of a bar drunk at 3am, feeling an attack of the munchies, and then indulging in on a Heart Attack Special from one of these stands.&nbsp; Mmmm....yummy! &nbsp; To be honest, other than the occasional drunken visit, I don't visit these stands very often.&nbsp; Their cleanliness leaves something to be desired, and most of the food is meat-oriented so I stay away from it.&nbsp; But I still think it's really cool that I *could* buy some miscellaneous mystery meat on the street if I ever wanted to!&nbsp; Here's a random sample of just some of the things that can be purchased from one of these little stands: &nbsp; -roasted corn on the cob (Henry was especially thrilled with this when he was here visiting) -grilled spicy chicken -corn dogs (sometimes even with french fries glued to them!) -giant sausages -egg sandwiches -fried squid (can be a couple inches or nearly two feet long) -fried tenatacles from other unidentifiable sea things -silkworm larvae (the smell of this is enough to make me gag pretty much every time I pass one!) -various deep-fried pastry thingies (most are actually quite tasty) -donuts -some pasta-like noodlish things in spicy sauce (very chewy) -potato pancakes (often comes mixed with seaweed, vegetables, or seafood) &nbsp; And I can't forget the chicken trucks!&nbsp; Technically they're not a roadside stand like all of the above, but they're SO WORTH a mention!&nbsp; Chicken trucks are these little trucks that have a giant oven roaster filled with whole chickens on giant rotating skewers!&nbsp; The trucks find some place to park (and usually in very strange locations, like right next to busy roads where no one would be able to stop without causing a major accident) and then sit there all day or night waiting for people to come and buy chicken on an impulse.&nbsp; Again, they're especially amusing cause of their unexpected locations.&nbsp; You'll be walking down some residential street and all of a sudden HELLO! there's a chicken truck right in front of you.&nbsp; They have glass doors on the giant oven so you can actually see them cooking as you walk by.&nbsp; (and if you're curious about how much it costs to purchase one of these little urban poultry specials, it's usually 1 for 6000 won or 2 for 10,000 won)&nbsp; It's totally funny for us foreigners cause&nbsp;back home you'd NEVER see some dude selling roast chicken on a random street corner out of his truck/mobile oven! &nbsp; Ahhh Korea, always full of entertaining and amusing things!&nbsp; :-)

      Today was my first full day of teaching all by myself.&nbsp; I was totally excited for it, and also really nervous at the same time.&nbsp; I wanted to do well and come across as cool and confident - and totally organized.&nbsp; I must admit that I was still a bit frazzled with all the schedules.&nbsp; All the classes have funny code numbers and the fact that I have alternating schedules every day adds to the whole confusion thing as well.&nbsp; Anyway, I have pre-school in the morning and they've been a breeze so at least I'll start off on a good foot. &nbsp; I have 12 pre-schooler kids - 6 boys and 6 girls.&nbsp; They're adorable and cute and FULL OF ENERGY!&nbsp; WOW!&nbsp; You don't know tired until you've done four classes full of a dozen 4-year olds all on your own!&nbsp; Each block is just 40 minutes and the fact that it's broken into 'subjects' makes things a little easier for me.&nbsp; My day was going really well and I was actually enjoying myself quite a lot.&nbsp; All the kids were behaving and everything was going as smooth as silk... &nbsp; ...until the last few minutes of the last block came 'round... &nbsp; My last block of the AM with the pre-schoolers is 'Activity Time' which is a great way to end my morning with them.&nbsp; Everyday they get a new little project to complete - something 'arts n crafts' related and it's really easy for me.&nbsp; My Korean assistant teacher organizes it for me and I basically just have to sit and supervise while the kids keep themselves occupied colouring and cutting away.&nbsp; Today we were making shark teeth necklaces out of clay and it was proving to be quite a tricky activity actually!&nbsp; The clay kept falling apart and the kids were making teeth way too small to be hung on a piece of string.&nbsp; The clock was ticking away while only a handful of kids had completed their necklaces... &nbsp; Suddenly the block was over and time was up - all the kids now had to clean up and pack everything away to get ready to head home.&nbsp; Again, most of the kids hadn't finished their necklaces, which certainly disappointed them, but they put their incomplete pieces of clay jewelry on the shelf and soon forgot about it.&nbsp; Except for one. &nbsp; I have one student who I had been warned about ahead of time and her name is Eugene.&nbsp; Under normal, everyday conditions Eugene is quiet and shy but friendly and fairly obedient.&nbsp; She gets along with her peers...most of the time...and is a pretty smart girl.&nbsp; Her only vice is that she hates, and I mean H-AT-E-S hearing the word 'No.'&nbsp; So when it was time to pack up the activity and head home, and she was standing their with her half-finished necklace, and I told her she had to put it away, well...that's when all hell broke loose. &nbsp; Eugene started to put up a fuss insisting that she wanted to finish the necklace, but we were completely out of time and the kids can't miss their bus so their was no option to delay any further.&nbsp; Suddenly she broke out into a full-fledged tamper-tantrum!&nbsp; Over the last 5 months of teaching young children I've seen my fair share of fits, but nothing can compare to what Eugene can do!&nbsp; When she blows, she becomes this screaming, kicking, yelling, sobbing, flailing, hysterical, out of control brat.&nbsp; We're talking a full complete Mariah Carey of a breakdown here, with all systems shutting down, and everything logical grinding to a complete halt.&nbsp; And absolutely nothing you can do can shut her up.&nbsp; You can try and comfort her, yell at her, attempt to reason with her, remove her from the class, send her to the hall or bathroom, whatever.&nbsp; There really is nothing you can say or do to make her stop.&nbsp; And she'll go for a good 10, 15, more minutes straight without stopping for a breath.&nbsp; As a teacher I've never felt so frustrated or helpless! &nbsp; She actually frightens all the other kids in the class, and is SO LOUD all the other kids in all the other classes in the school can hear her.&nbsp; IT'S CRAZY!&nbsp; So on my first morning I got to be an unwilling participant in The Wrath Of Eugene and it was not a pretty sight.&nbsp; God I only hope that she's not like this everyday!&nbsp; My ears and wits just won't be able to take this on a daily basis!&nbsp; I feel kinda guilty for thinking it, but I was SO GLAD to see her leave the school that day.&nbsp; Here's hoping that tomorrow she doesn't prove to be a repeat offender!

      I was up bright and early this morning - 6:30am!!  My ride was coming to pick me up at 7:30am and I had to be ready for my busy (but short) excursion to Japan.  It was great that my work paid for my flight and also arranged a ride for me out to the airport.  Incheon International is kinda far from everything else (being built on an island off-shore) but is a really fabulous airport.  All glass and steel, bright and shiny - it's a wonder of post-modern construction.  A really spectacular gateway in and out of Korea.    Getting checked in was a bit tricky.  I apparently needed a special stamp to leave the country since my old work visa didn't allow multiple entries.  After being shuffled back and forth between several desks, with each employee looking more lost and confused than the one before, I was beginning to think I'd never get on that plane!  Finally they just 'let me through' but told me I'd have to leave my alien identification card in the process.  No worries there - I'll be getting a new one soon.  Security and immigration were both crazy busy but finally I was through it all and it was time to board the plane.  My flight to Osaka on Asiana Airlines was a delight!  The service was great, the flight really comfortable, the food quite yummy...I only wished it was longer!  Just under an hour and a half later we were landing in Japan.  Man, that was fast!  Coming into Osaka by air was really cool!  I had a window seat and was awarded with spectacular views of the city, harbour, and mountains below me.  Osaka looked massive and modern and I could see many impressive buildings from the plane.  We flew over this ENORMOUS bridge connecting two of Japan's largest islands and even over neighbouring Kobe.  Kobe was severely damaged in a 1995 earthquake but there was no evidence of it now...  If I was impressed with Incheon Int'l, I was blown away by Osaka's Kansai Int'l Airport!  Landing here was like stepping into the future!  It's one of the biggest airports I've ever seen in my life and is built on an artificial island way out in the ocean, connected to the mainland by a super-long road/rail link.  The terminal is UNBELIEVABLY LONG!!  So long, that you actually have to board a small monorail train to take you from one end to the other!  Riding a train *INSIDE* an airport???  How cool is that!!!  It was all smooth sailing until I reached Japanese Immigration...  Oh boy...  There was a MASSIVE line-up at Immigration!  I guess several int'l flights just landed all at the same time?  What else would explain the massive backlog?  The line just crawled along at a snail's pace and I was getting a bit worried about the time.  I had a mission to accomplish that day in Osaka but only a narrow window of time before I had to catch my return flight back to Korea.  Massive line-ups are *not* part of the schedule!  Luckily I met two other guys in line who were doing the exact same visa run as I was and we decided to join forces and ban together.  We shared each other's 'info sheets' that each of us were given about the visa run process and this is when slight panicking began...  According to Sean's info sheet, not only do all visa applications have to be at the consulate's office before 2pm in order to be processed that day (it was then 1pm and we were still way out at the airport!) but that the cost was $150 US!!!  What the...!!???  Neither Greg nor I had brought enough Yen with us for that cost as we had both been told it was cheaper.  We had no way to access our money in Korea and started to get worried that we had come all that way to Japan only to be short on dough for the application.  Shit!  Finally we made it through Immigration and we immediately boarded the train that took us from Kansai into central Osaka.  This proved to be quite a long ride as the station we needed to head to was the last stop.  Murphy's Law!  All three of us nervously glanced at our watches as our train stopped at every whistle stop along the way.  We were really cutting it close for time!  We arrived at our station at 3 minutes before 2 o'clock - only 120 seconds to run and find that consulate's office and get our papers in!  This is when the three of us stepped into "Amazing Race" mode and got all serious.  It totally felt like we were on the show!  We had just arrived in a foreign city none of us had ever been to with a mission to accomplish and the clock ticking!  Would we make it?  We *BOLTED* out of the station and began running up the street, maps, directions, and papers in hand.  The first thing I noticed was how INCREDIBLY HOT AND HUMID it was in Osaka.  I mean Korea's humid all the time, but this was a different kind of humidity.  A very, very WET kind.  In about 10 seconds I was sweating like a racehorse but all I could think about was getting to that office in time.  At first we couldn't find the consulate (in our mad running around the streets of Osaka, dodging  speedy bicyclists, racing cars, and fashionable passerby that wasn't a surprise) and had to stop and ask for directions a few times.  (Luckily Greg had a sheet that had, in Japanese, "Can you please tell me where to find the Korean Consulate?  Thank you!")  RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN  Amazing Race, here I come!  If I ever get the chance to go on that show (one of my Top Ten Missions In Life) I'm gonna be damn-well prepared after all my crazy travel experiences, that's for sure!!  :-)  We found the Consulate and got our papers in just after 2pm.  The lady behind the desk said there was no problem and that we could pick it up after 4pm.  And also that the cost was only about $70 CDN.  WHEW!!!  SAVED!!  We then had 2 hours to kill so we decided to grab some lunch and walk around and try explore what we could in that short period of time.  We wandered down some pedestrian streets and just tried to absorb it all.    AND OSAKA IS WAY COOL!!!  There were many similarities to Seoul, but it definitely had its own unique vibe.  It was much cleaner and more modern than Seoul, and it was cool to see all the cars driving on the left-hand side.  In terms of people, they also looked different too.  The hairstyles and fashion seemed much hipper and much more international with a lot of Western influences.  It just seemed like a more cosmopolitan city and it definitely seemed like a city I'd love to explore for a few days.  Unfortunately all we had was 2 hours so we did a bit of shopping (picked up some cool T-shirts) and then went to find a place for lunch.  The only thing that I didn't like about Japan was the cost.  OMG IT'S SO EXPENSIVE!!!  We decided that since we were in Japan we may as well have Japanese food for lunch, so we wanted to find something casual and cheap.  This proved to be near impossible!!!  We went from restaurant to restaurant but COULD NOT find a lunch below $50 CDN!!!  HOLY SHIT!  Is this normal for Japan or are we just in a really expensive part of town?  If these prices are average for here, how does anyone afford to live in that city!!!???  Finally we found a cheaper place (about $10 CDN for a very small lunch) and were pleased just to spend some time in a place that had air conditioning.  Thank God for Air Con!!!  After lunch we headed back to the Consulate and picked up our papers - everything went through and all three of us had bright shiny new Korean work visas.  Yah!!!  (a huge sigh of relief from me, considering everything I've gone through in the last couple of weeks!)  And then it was time to head right back to the airport - no more time to hang out or wander the city.  This time when we got the station we noticed that there was an ExpressTrain option back to Kansai - way smarter!  We bought tickets for this and were excited to see that this train was like a futuristic purple bullet train that looked like a giant submarine!  So cool!!  It brought us to Kansai in like half the time and we arrived at the airport around 5pm.  Plenty of time to go through Immigration and catch our 7pm flight.    Leaving Japan proved to be a cinch and there weren't any line-ups at all.  Next thing we knew we were back on the plane and cruising to Korea.  Wow - less than 8 hours altogether in Japan and really only a mere two hours to actually see anything.  It was a super short visit but a total blast and adventure.  It definitely piqued (sp?) my interest with Japan and I'd LOVE to go back again sometime to explore more - if I can afford it!  I had a ride again waiting for me at the airport and was home in my apartment by 10:30pm at night.  What a whirlwind day - but so much fun!  This whole 'jet-set, lets visit a country for a day and run around the streets thing' was just the coolest adventure.  And like I said, not having to pay for it was the icing on the cake!  I was really tired for bed, and tomorrow was going to be my first day of teaching all by myself.  Another big day on its way!

      All I can say is, to everyone who's joined the dialogue and posted comments regarding the recent political discussion, you guys rock!!!  I love all the wonderful dialogue and debates and heated (ranging in temperatures from luke warm to searing to Fahrenheit 911) comments!  Who knew that just one blog entry of mine could provoke so much response!  It's great!  An especially big thank you to my pal Scott Erdman (yes, he has the same name as me, but that's another story) in Chicago who was brave enough to take the first plunge.  My blog has never been this exciting and I owe it all to you!  ;-)  Moving on, (and I need to cause I'm like a full week behind on my blog!!!) today was a pretty lazy day...for the first half anyways.  This is probably cause I didn't even wake up until noon today!!!  Last night, to celebrate Meighan's last weekend in town, a big gang of us went out clubbing in Hondai (sp?) which is a night club district in Sinchon area in Seoul.  Hondai is legendary for all of its clubs and nightlife and nocturnal antics and I was anxious to check it out for the first time ever.  It was a total blast!  Despite the fact that monsoon season is in full effect here in Korea and it was P-O-U-R-I-N-G all night long, the area was still hoppin' with club-goers.  We went to a place called HodgePodge which was like 2 clubs in one - techno and house on the bottom floor and Top40 on the top floor.  We spent time on both floors but I had the most fun upstairs.  We danced the night away and had a really amazing time!  We got home around 4am or so and I was completely exhausted!  (and drunk, I don't even remember the cab ride home!)  Half the day was already gone today when I woke up, and it was a completely unproductive afternoon.  All my goals for the day of doing some house-cleaning, massive blog-writing, and phone call-making totally went down the toilet!  Evening came round and I had done absolutely nothin' all day!  Ugh...  I met up with Amy, Steve, and Kelsey later on and we headed into Seoul to watch a really cool performance.  It was called 'Jump!' and it was a non-verbal martial arts show and it was amazing!!!  It turned out to be a comedy show which I had not predicted at all, and was absolutley hilarious!  All the actors performed completely silly skits while continually impressing us with their martial arts/gymnastics skills that were infused with the comedy.  We all loved the show and I'd even go back to see it again!  I had a later dinner after that and then tried to go to bed somewhat early.  I have to wake up tomorrow at 6:30am to head to Japan and I *KNOW* it's gonna be a busy day!  I can't wait for it!!!

      Alrighty.  I don't usually respond to comments that people write me, even though I do read (and love!) each and every one, but I received one today that I just *HAD* to respond to.  It was a response to my opinions regarding the TV commercials on AFN and my "American-bashing."  Although I still stand behind my opinions regarding the subject matter of TV ads on the Armed Forces Network, I first off wish to apologize if I offended any of my friends/readers.  As mentioned in my blog, all of my 'cons' listed in that entry are either exaggerated or mostly just written in jest/sarcasm.  However, I again wish to apologize if my humour caused any offense amongst my loyal fans.  At the same time, however, I also feel strongly compelled to defend my opinions and return the criticism back to the source of the comment.  For those who haven't read this comment below (under Day 139: Life In The Village), the author alludes (but does not outright say) that I'm hypocritic in my views regarding America and American culture.  They strongly scold me for "American-bashing" while in my next breath I go on to write about many other American cultural products (ie: media, restaurants, etc.) that I enjoy.    I feel that this argument is ill-informed and incorrect in using this simple comparison, and that it also unfortunately narrows down the argument to a mere 'black-and white' scenario - posing/suggesting the thought that I have to either love everything about America or hate it all.    But sir/madam ~ I beg to differ!  It doesn't have to be one way OR the other.  Both viewpoints (and a million other variations inbetween) can *and should* coexist together in the same world.   Life is never black and white.  Everything is in shades of grey.   Here's why:  I CAN hate American foreign policy and government leadership AND still admire America as a nation.  I CAN criticize and dennounce and strongly dislike certain specific Americans AND still love other Americans as individuals (most of my family, in fact, is American, and I have many very dear friends who are US citizens.)  I CAN critique the influence that American cultural biproducts have on mass globalization and the rapid extinction of foreign indigenous cultures AND still enjoy the very same American cultural biproducts myself.  I CAN voice my strong opinions about the current actions of the American military, both here in Korea and elsewhere abroad AND still be thankful for the historical role they have had in keeping South Korea safe.  I CAN hate the sin but still love the sinner (sorry to use a Catholic reference!)  I CAN strongly criticize America in terms of its cultural influence, global military role, mover-n-shaker position in the world AND not have an inferiority complex.    I CAN be displeased with the actions of the world's most powerful nation AND realize that my own nation Canada, much like every other single other nation on the planet, is also not perfect.    I CAN possess and formulate and voice my own opinions against political and cultural entities, such as the United States of America, AND still be a good guy (and *not* a 'basher.'  Since when does having opinions that disagree with your own equate to "bashing"?  What happened to 'agreeing to disagree' in this world?)  I CAN *NOT* be 'Either With You Or Against You'.   The world is a complex place filled with complicated people.  Nothing is ever easy or simple or instantly clear or always agreeable or contintually fashionably neutral and pretty all the time.  Anyone who knows me knows that I have a lot of very strong (and occasionally controversial) opinions regarding that nation south of the 49th Parallel. It's just who I am, and I'm not going to apologize or feel guilty for possessing such thoughts.  I never mean to cause personal offense, but I *strongly believe* that we need discontent and discussion and dialogue in this world in order to make it work.  I'm proud of my own thoughts and ideas and opinions, and am not afraid to share them with the world via my blog.  (Cause at the end of the day, it still is MY blog.  I can write whatever the hell I feel like.  Right?)  I would like to say, in final, that I was disappointed that the criticizer of my blog entry did not even leave their name so I would know the source.  If you're going to fire a shot against me, at least have the balls to sign your name to your own work.  I always encourage and appreciate everyone's thoughts and opinions, (yes, even when they greatly differ from my own) but prefer to know where they come from.    Don't I at least deserve that much respect?

      Poly phoned me yesterday to let me know that all my papers had gone through with Korean Immigration (now is the appropriate time to let out a huge YAHOO!!!) and that I can start work at Poly pretty much immediately.  They wanted me to come in on Monday but since I had no plans for today I figured what the heck, why not start now?  Today was a really busy but fun day.  Jeannette has been teaching all of my classes (both the pre-school ones and the afternoon elementary ones) and so the plan for today was to follow her around so that I can meet all of my future students and become familiar with the schedule.  I also was to teach every second class so this would give me a feel for how it would all go.  I was a little nervous to teach my first classes but it was really easy and fun and Jeannette was super helpful too.  All my kids really seemed to like me and all in all the day was a big success I'd say!  I received some exciting news from Poly today also - I would be going to Japan for my Visa run on MONDAY!!!  WOW!!!  I'm totally stoked!!!  I only get to spend an afternoon in Osaka and most of it will be running around doing Immigration stuff but I'm still really looking forward to it! I mean, how often do you get to go to fly to a foreign country (FOR FREE!) just for the day???  So cool!  After work tonight I went to hang out at Amy's with Kelsey and the three of us ordered some pizza and then just hung out and watched TV.  After spending a few hours at Amy's we cabbed it on over to LaFesta where we were meeting up with a big gang for some drinks.  It was both Amy and Meighan's last weekend in town and we wanted to celebrate their accomplishment of a year in Korea before they moved on to their next adventures.  Everyone was there when we arrived - Meighan, her friend Jen visiting from Canada, Jess, Rick, Tracy, Steve, Ben, Brian, Pauline, Jeremy, and Sam!  WOW WHAT A BIG GANG!  We sat outside on some patio tables and chairs and had some beers that we had bought from the local convenience store (yes, alcohol is sold nearly everywhere in Korea!)    Seeing 15 foreigners sitting all together in one giant group proved to be a spectacle too exciting for many Korean passerby to simply pass up!  Time and time again during the night random Korean pedestrians would just S-T-A-R-E at us while they walked by, and some would even stop and just stand and look at us for a while!!  There was even one man who seemed so interested in our presence that he circled our group at least two or three times, completely transfixed by the sight of so many foreigners sitting outside!!  As amusing as all of this was, it was a little uncomfortable at the same time.  After a while you start to feel like you're animals in a zoo, or mannequins on display in a store window.  I mean 'HELLO! We can see you staring at us!  You're only 3 feet away!!!'  LOL!  Ahhh well, it's good for a laugh and really just makes you feel popular!  Haha!  You get used to it but sometimes it's just so blatantly obvious and unabashed that it can make you feel a little uneasy.  Oh well, it all comes with the territory, right?  :-)

      Here's a list of the pros, and the corresponding cons, of my new life here in 'The Village.'  PRO #1: The Village is really friendly and family-oriented.  It's a safe, wholesome neighbourhood in a clean and green corner of Ilsan and is full of inquisitive kids who love to ask random questions in English to any passing foreigner.  It's cute!  CON #1: Every frickin' weekend morning those damn kids are up and about on the streets, yelling their heads off!  Doesn't any kid in Korea ever wanna sleep in?  And what about Saturday morning cartoons?  Maybe that's just a Western tradition, but then shouldn't there be a big pot of kimchee those kids should be stirring that morning?  I don't care - I just don't wanna hear them yell at 7:12am on a Saturday morning!  PRO #2: The Village is really animal-friendly and tons of the local families have pet cats and dogs.  I *NEVER* saw any animals in my old hood in Shihung (except for abused ones) and it's great to be able to walk down my street and find cute kitties and puppies begging to be petted!  CON #2: Cat fights!  OMG, seriously, I hear *AT LEAST* three cat fights every single night at like 3am!  Those little kitties may be all wide-eyed and cutesy in the day time, but as soon as the sun goes down they turn into deadly, vicious little savages who are just dying to rip each other to pieces!  And that ain't a quiet exchange of meows, let me tell ya!  PRO #3: Almost all of my friends in Korea now live within a 2-minute walking distance from my house!  I'm never all that far away from a buddy and it almost feels 'college dorm-like!'  It's so much fun - and way more convenient for my social life!  CON #3: I never get anything done!  Before when I lived way out in the boonies I had tons of free time to keep up with my email and blog, reading, watching my fave TV shows, and to chat on the phone with friends back home.  Now I'm never home and so all that stuff gets neglected!  My bad!  PRO #4: I have new channels in my new apartment, including AFN which is the Armed Forces Network.  AFN is the all-English TV station for the American military in Korea and has TONS of great shows on all the time, plus lots of really fun movies.  90% of the TV I now watch is on AFN.  CON #4: I get exposed to all of AFN's uber-cheesy, low-budget, PRO-AMERICAN MILITARY propaganda TV commercials!!!  If you thought that Thunder Bay TBT commercials were low-budget and cheesy, you ain't seen nothin' yet!!  And worst of all, is that EVERY COMMERCIAL (and "news" broadcast) is so full of American imperialism, jingoism, pro-Bush, pro-military, pro-"We're American so we're great - read: FULL OF OURSELVES - and everyone loves us so bow down and kiss our asses" arrogance and egoism that some days I don't know whether to laugh, cry, or projectile vomit all over the TV!  It honestly feels like I'm in George Orwell's 1984 and that 'Big Brother is watching me' or something.  The AFN commercials really *are* that bad!  PRO #5: There is a Baskin-Robbins just down the street from my apartment!  I get to have ice cream absolutley anytime I please!  And with the hot weather we've been having it's sure been awfully yummy!  CON #5: Steve and I are totally addicted to ice cream now.  We go there almost every single day and by the end of the summer I'm sure I'll weigh *at least* 300 pounds!  Haha!  So there ya have it - just a little snapshot of my new life in The Village.  I absolutely love where I live and pretty much all the cons I've listed here are either exaggerated or just for fun.  I've no major complaints and am a happy boy these days in my new hood!

      Today was definitely a day that I'll never forget!  Today was the day when all of my stardom dreams came true and I made my television debut!!  Okay, I wasn't actually on TV *TODAY* but it was filmed today and will be on air next week.  Today was the day that Steve and I competed on 'Quiz Show: The Contenders!'  The Contenders is Korea's most popular game show and is a trivia-based quiz show where contenders compete in pairs in several rounds against each other, with the winners being awarded with great trips!  The show is a huge hit amongst both locals (well, those who understand English) and of course the foreigners' community.  Ask any English Teacher in Korea and they'll know about The Contenders!  Steve and I went down to the studio for 11:30am and as soon as we arrived our nerves really went wild!  We were excited to be on the show, and have been talking about it forever, but now it was actually going to happen.  FOR REAL!  No more joking around and imagining cool scenarios about what would happen if we actually won - this was the real deal.  We had to fill out a bunch of paperwork first, and then were given coupons for a free lunch in the cafeteria downstairs.  I was way too nervous to eat so I just nibbled on a banana and tried not to overthink things.  Hey man, I was about to be filmed on a game show - you'd be nervous too!!!  They were actually filming two episodes of the show today and Steve and I were scheduled for the second episode.  This meant that we had to sit around and watch them film the first episode, which proved to be both a blessing and a curse.  It was a blessing because it allowed us to watch, firsthand, how the show plays out and what's expected of contestants, but it also allowed even more time for our nerves to build up to inhumane levels!  After that we were brought back upstairs to prepare for the show and - *giggle* - get our hair and MAKE-UP done!!!  I've never 'had my make-up done' before and it was fun to sit in the special chair and have some Korean woman apply make-up to my face to help make me look hot for TV.  She didn't actually apply all that much - just some powder (?) to help reduce my skin's shininess, some colour for under my eyes to reduce darkness, and some extra red colour for my lips.  Too much fun!  Steve got a laugh out of the whole make-up deal too!  And then next thing we knew we were being 'miced-up' and it was time to get behind the stage...and away we go!!!!  We stepped out onto stage and it was SO BRIGHT with all the lights in our faces and it was completely surreal to stand at our podium, a dozen cameras panning all around us and a live audience cheering no more than five feet behind us.  CRAZY!!  ;-)  Steve and I were competing against a pair of Korean university girls who were under the name of Team Buddier (lame if you ask me!)  We were under the guise of Team Hotboyz (thanks to Andrea for picking our team name!!!) and we were so convinced that we were going to whip those girls' asses!  This proved to be a harder challenge than we imagined...  Round 1 consists of each team being presented with 10 multiple-choice questions, in the same style as 'Who Wants To Be A Millionnaire?'  When each pair gets an answer right they're presented with the next question for an additional ten points.  Well Steve and I didn't do as well as we hoped - we got stumped on question #7 and so were stuck with just 60 points.  DOH!  Then THOSE GIRLS actually beat us and got seven questions right for a total of 70 points.  WE WERE BEHIND!!!???  Round 2 was an absolute blast!  This round is modelled after the board game 'Taboo' where one team member has to try and get the other person to guess a specific word using descriptions.  You're given your category in advance, and for Team Hotboyz that was the TV show 'Friends'!  You have to guess 20 words in only 100 seconds and the key to this round is clarity and speed!  I was the one who had to describe the words and Steve had to guess.  Well we did smashingly well on this category!!  We whipped through 17 of those words and I was so proud of little Steve (who's never really watched the show but has been studying really hard up on it!)  Despite our breath-taking performance on Round 2, in the end THOSE DAMN GIRLS were still 10 points ahead of us!!!  WHAT THE...???!!!  Alright!  This was it!  No more Mr. Nice Hotboyz!  You wanna play dirty, girls?  Well then let's get DIRRTY!  Round 3 is a simple question-and-answer trivia where each team tries to 'buzz in' first to answer the question.  This was the round that should be described as "How Team Hotbozy Got Their Groove Back!" cause Steve and I ended up kicking major ass!!!  We blew those chicks right out of the water!!!  The Hotboyz were ON *FIRE*!!!  (If you touch my ass right now you'll STILL get burned - we were *that* hot!!!)  Our score flew right past those little Korean bitches and we took the trophy!  Team Hotboyz were the official champions of The Primary Rounds!    "Oh Yeah!!!"  After this is when things got really hot and heavy on that studio...  Round 4 is where you have to compete against the fear-inducing "Last Week's Defending Champions!"  There's no prize for winning the first part of the show - this is when you get the chance to win cool trips and really, truly become famous superstars in Korea!  ;-)  LWDC were a team under the stupid name of 'WhoAWe' but stupid they were not - they had won 3 times in a row and were definitely smart cookies!  But Steve and I were pumped from our initial victory and were ready to take them on!  Round 4 is set up exactly like 'Jeopardy' where there's 5 categories to choose from with questions ranging in points and corresponding difficulty levels.  Our categories were: BORDERS, INVENTIONS, FAMOUS PEOPLE WHO DIED YOUNG, DISASTERS, AND ART.  The defending champions got to pick our first question and Borders it was.  Being that this was a category based on GEOGRAPHY Steve and I totally thought we had it in the bag.  (I mean come on, I have a frickin' degree in that subject, and Steve's a Geo buff too!)    Somehow, however, WhoAWe blasted right out of the cannon and ran circles around us.  Before I could even blink they had answered 3 of those borders questions leaving us eating their dust and sitting at a lovely ZERO points!  Holy shit!  Time to get our asses in gear!!!  Steve and I gathered our numbed senses and jumped right on in, finishing off the Borders category with two wins.  After that we were an unstoppable answering machine, and went on to win another five or six consecutive questions! WOW!!!  'Take that, you WhoAWe bastards!!!  Not so cocky now, are we???'  I think that this sudden, surprisingly long run of wins for Steve and I caught them off-guard!  They totally seemed speechless and were practically peeing their panties up their on stage.  We shattered their ill-fated confidence like a non-existent weapon of mass destruction through one of Bush's non-sensical addresses of fiction to the nation!  'OHHHHHHHHHHH BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Who's your daddy now???  Yeah!!'  *(insert grunting and hip-thrusting here)*  Then came what I like to describe as "The Retaliation"  Those sneaky little WhoAWe motherfuckers managed to grab a correct answer and then steered us right into 'The Catergory Of Lost Hope And Desperation' - Art!  Steve and I know absolutely fuckin' nothing about art - NOTHING!  Time and time again we tried desperately to grab back our winning spotlight but it was all to no avail.  WhoAWe may be scruffy mingers who smell bad, but DAMN they sure as hell know their art!  After that it was a back and forth battle between 'The 2 Cocks' team and "The Cock & Tits' team and let me tell you, it was a feverish, flailing, fantastically orgasmic neck-and-neck race for the finish line.  In no time at all the gap between the two teams were closing - the much-coveted lead that Steve and I had held was disappearing before our very eyes, one leap at a time...  Suddenly we were at the end of the game with the Hotboyz only leading by 30 fragile points.  The Final Question was worth a whopping 50 points...  Whoever won this last question would win the game and take home the prize of a free trip.  Who would steal the gold medal for the last time, and who would go home with their tail between their legs?  It literally was anybody's game...  The last question, in a category I don't even remember, was about some 'famous' (let's use that term loosely here) poet.  The question was posed, and I had no fuckin' idea what the answer was!!!  I looked at Steve and his face was as blank and as white as mine!!!  OH NO!!!!!!!!  But, the gods of luck were shining down upon us that fateful afternoon in that tense, nerve-wracking studio...  I looked over to WhoAWe and their faces were just as blank and white and dumb-founded as ours....  NOBODY KNEW THE ANSWER!!!  The hosts prodded and pushed us, desperately anxious for somebody - ANYBODY - to answer the friggin' question, but we all just sat in silence....  And so, by a matter of default on that last question, Team Hotboyz kept their lead and   WON THE GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Steve and I were actually more shocked than we were excited!  We honestly did not expect this to happen!!  Who would've thought that a couple cocky bastards from Ilsan like ourselves would actually win the game?  Not me!  WOW!!!  So we both win a trip to Jeju Island, and a chance to come back in 2 weeks to maybe trade the trip up for one to Japan (if we win again!)  The only problem with this is that Steve leaves Korea before that time, so most likely this spells the end of Team Hotboyz' unstoppable winning streak.  Ahh well.  It's disappointing that I'm losing my partner to Mongolia and won't be able to compete again, but it sure was fun while it lasted!  The episode with our magnificent performance will be aired next Friday nation-wide across the whole of Korea and I plan on gathering all my friends together for a big Viewing Party.  Steve and I decided not to tell any of our friends in Korea about our win so as to build up anticipation amongst the gang.  It's gonna be great fun to watch it all play out on TV!!!!!  Fame and fortune, here I come!  ;-)

      My friend Kelsey had to run into Seoul today to get a bunch of vaccinations, and she invited me along for company.  I didn't have any plans of my own today so I thought why not?  I ended up signing up for more than I bargained for!  Kelsey's going on an African safari in just 2 weeks and so she needs to get a shitload of needles to keep her safe from the Plague and Ebola and Hanta Virus and Dengue Fever and all the other biological surprises that lie waiting in the jungles of the Dark Continent!  Actually she just needs the usual Hepatitis A & B shots, a shot for Yellow Fever, and some malaria pills.  Since I'm planning my own big trek across Asia next year when I finish at Poly, and will need to get most of these shots myself, I decided that tagging along would be a really educational experience for myself.  We subwayed it into Seoul and went to the National Medical Center located right in the heart of the city - one of only two places in Korea where you can get the shot for Yellow Fever.  Kelsey had a 2 o'clock appointment, and it was a supposed to be a 'pop-in, pop right back out' trip to the hospital.  BOY WAS THAT EVER FAR FROM THE TRUTH!!!  What an ordeal...  It turned out to be one of the longest, most frustrating, most drawn-out, most bureaucratic, most *excrutiating* processes I've ever had to witness here in Korea!  We spent the next TWO AND A HALF HOURS getting shuffled from desk to desk, from nurse to nurse, from one wing of the hospital complex to another...  Nobody seemed to know where we were supposed to be, nobody had any clue what was going on in other departments of the hospital, and almost nobody spoke any English at all!  It seemed like we kept getting told the wrong information, and kept getting directed to the wrong desk or the wrong nurse.  Doesn't anybody here know what's going on?  Is this the first time EVER in Korea that ANYONE has ever gotten shots for travelling to a developing country?  You'd think that this whole process would be done by just one nurse in just one part of the hospital, but nope, it was like they designed the whole Vaccination Experience to be as irritatingly complicated as medically and humanly possible!  It took all we had to remain patient and composed, but eventually we got everything we needed, Kelsey got all drugged up, and it was time for her to head back to work - 2 hours late!    MY GOD THAT WAS NOT AFTERNOON!!!  LOL!  When we got back to Ilsan I decided to go shopping for my first big load of groceries for my new place, and I spent way too much money on treats for myself.  There's a giant grocery store here called Carrefour that has a lot of foreign foods (well, more so than can be found at other Korean grocery stores anyway) and so I bought a bunch of comfort food for myself - nachos and salsa, some good quality cheese, Ritz crackers, Pepperidge Farm cookies - all the good stuff!  YUM!  It's been *several months* since I've gotten a care package so I've been feeling especially lonesome for some familiar Western foods (hint hint, everyone!)  ;-)  I was feeling culinarily inspired when I got home (perhaps maybe only the third time or so that this has ever happened to me) and so I decided to make dinner for Steve and I.  I grilled up a big stirfry of veggies and then cooked up some tomato and basil pasta dinner to mix it all together in.  And amazingly it actually turned out really good!  Yah me!  ;-)  After dinner Steve and I went and got some ice cream and then laid out in the grass in the big park near our home for quite a while.  Tomorrow is our big debut, our big break, out introduction to fame via QUIZ SHOW: THE CONTENDERS!!! We've been studying all week on random trivia, and also on the category of 'Friends' because we've been told that in Round 2 that'll be our category!  I've watched the TV show religiously since it came out ten years ago but Steve's confessed to me that he's never actually seen an entire episode in full - EGAD!!!  It was a Crash Course on 'Everything One Needs To Know About FRIENDS' for Steve taught by yours truly!  But we're totally stoked to be on the show and are ready to go and kick major ass tomorrow on TV!!    WISH US LUCK!!!  :-)

      Today was a pretty slack day, but I'm cool with that!  I went into Poly this morning to do a bunch of paperwork, mainly centering around the signing of my new contract.  It felt SO GREAT to be able to sign that contract.  That job contract represents everything in my new life, and I'm so grateful for being adopted by Poly into their family.  The only thing left to do now is wait.    Ahhh yes, the waiting game continues...    I may have a new job contract now, but I still can't yet begin to work.  All of my paperwork has to go off to Immigration for them to approve.  All the little important pieces have come together and now it just needs the legal stamp of approval for me to get my new visa.  This usually takes about 72 hours to process, providing there's no more major hiccups along the way.  With Korean Immigration you just never know!  After that, I just have to do my 'Visa Japan Run' and I'm all good to begin teaching again in Korea.  Korean Law has a funny rule about having to get your new visa ONLY from outside the country.  For some strange reason, it can't be processed within the country and your last stamp has to be done at a Korean Consulate's office somewhere - anywhere - outside of Korea.  This sounds complicated but it's actually a fairly simple (and common) procedure.  So this means that I'll have to go to the nearest foreign country to get this stamp in my passport, and that would be Japan!  Yes, I'll soon be going to Japan for the day, all on Poly's expense!  ;-)  I'll have to fly to Japan in the morning (most likely Osaka), get my stamp in the passport and transfer some more paperwork, and then the very same day fly back to Korea.  How cool is that!!!  How often do you get to say "I went to Japan for the day!"???  ;-)  My little hop over to Japan will hopefully be at the end of this week, but probably be early next week.  What can I say?  It's all just another day in the life of Scotty and The S2H World Tour!  ;-)

      Michael and I slept in LATE today - it was so nice!  I had been so exhausted from a very physically and emotionally-draining 3-day stretch that I really need to catch up on my Z's.    It was another really hot and humid day today but was atleast sunny and bright.  That's one of the many great things about Ilsan - because of its location in NW Greater Seoul, sorta close to the sea and also North Korea, and separated from most of the city by the mountains of Bukhansan National Park, the air is *substantially* better than the rest of the city!  When most of Seoul is choking under an unforgiving blanket of thick, toxic smog, Ilsan is basking under sunny, clear, blue skies! Still, with the heat it's hard to be motivated to do much sometimes, and I was definitely feeling lazily lethargic today.  Michael and I went over to LaFesta cause he had never seen it before, and we spent the afternoon just wandering around the mall.  We had some lunch at a Vietnamese restaurant and then it was time for my big change...  I had decided that I wanted to get a haircut today, and that I wanted a dramatic change.  My hair has gotten RIDICULOUSLY long lately (the 'Rock Star/Surfer Boy Shag' was becoming dangerously close to 'Trailer Park/Had-An-Accident-With-Scissors/Did That Boy Grow Up In The Ozarks? Mullet') so I had to do something about it.  I had had two very bad haircuts prior to this here in Korea so I've been procrastinating getting another one for fear that I would not again survive the horror of seeing my precious hair butchered before my very eyes.  But I was beginning a new life here in Ilsan, and decided that a whole new hair style was in order.  I decided to *chop it all off*, not only just for the change, but also cause with the summer heat having all of this hair was like having a sleeping furry Persian cat stuck to my head all day.  Not fun!  Michael and I went to Marshall Beauty Salon in LaFesta - a salon chain that both Steve and Michael reccommended to me - and sat down with a couple mags to pick out my new style.  After a few minutes of perusing through a plethora of hairstyles, I had mine picked out.  So I went and had it all chopped off.  Snip snip snip and close to two years of grown-out hair was gone just like that.  It was exciting yet kinda scary at the same time.  Unlike the other salon I'd been to, this place seemed like it employed real hairstylists who *actually* knew how to wield a pair of scissors.  They took the time to do it right, and it turned out GREAT!  Before long there was a pile of my hair around me big enough to sew into a sweater, and a new fresh do atop my head!  The blond is all gone, and in its place is a fun and funky spikyish style, kinda Korean mixed with Euro style I think.  I quite like it, and it's fun to see my natural dark brown hair back again!  Michael approved of it too, and I left the salon feeling way cooler, both in terms of cranial temperature and overall level of hair sexiness!  ;-)  I think I'll take this as a good sign, that the universe is telling me that all is gonna be good in my world again.  Yah!  ;-)

      Today was a really good day.  I met up with my Director, Chang, and he gave me the keys to my new apartment (formerly known as 'Brad's Place!')  The apartment was actually quite filthy from before but I didn't care at all.  It was my new space to make my own, it was my new safe home.  I was just thrilled to be out of Shihung, and thought it was pretty cool that my new life would pick up right exactly in the same space where Brad and Andrea's journey in Korea ended.  It actually sorta felt like a sitcom - the same set used for the show even when other characters move on (kinda like how Joey & Chandler switched apartments with Monica & Rachel for a while on 'Friends'!)  ;-)  I spent all day cleaning.  Clean, clean, clean.  I became a virtual Miss Molly Maid and scrubbed that place from top to bottom, and man did it need it!  There were surfaces in that place that I had always believed were gray in colour, but was shocked to discover were actually WHITE!  I cleaned the bathroom, kitchen, and living room from top to bottom - every surface, walls, floor, ceiling - *everything.*  I've always kinda been an obsessive cleaner whenever I move into a new space.  It's like I can't rest until I know that it's officially been sanitized by moi, then I get to have peace of mind.  I also unpacked all my clothes and personal belongings, and by the end of the day it looked pretty amazing I have to say.  It actually looked like MY SPACE now, filled with all my own stuff, but with the added bonus of all the wonderful memories that I had there with Brad, Andrea, and Steve. The TV show that is my life carries on, one episode at a time...  Michael rang me tonight and invited me out for dinner and another board game night out with the boys. I cleaned up and then took the bus into Seoul and then the subway to Itaewon.  I met up with Michael, Eric, and Tim and we were all starved so we headed to an Italian restaurant for dinner.  I was in such a better 'headspace' today - the best I've felt in a while - and it was nice to be out with friends and not be stressed by shit going on at home.  Dinner was awesome and then we had some ice cream from the ol' Baskin Robbins after that.  We then headed to a Board Game Cafe to have a night of Risk - 'The Game of World Conquest!'  It was a total blast - I love that game!!!  Risk has been an Erdman family tradition of ours for as long as I can remember (Dad always wins though!) and was also a game popular amongst my friends back in Vancouver (Graham and I have a 3-year ongoing competition with that damn game!)  These board game cafes are such a cool idea - they've instantly become popular amongst my friends!  We played two games of missions (not nearly as much fun as 'playing until death', until the last player conquers the globe) but I still a great time.  :-)  Michael drove me home after that and crashed at my place.  It was cool but kinda strange to be spending my first night ever in my new apartment with a houseguest!  ;-)  We stayed up late chatting for a while and then went to sleep in my new bed in my new apartment.  Peace, at last.

      So I have another holiday coming up next month and I'm trying to figure out what I should do with my time.  At the end of September is Chuseok which is the Korean equivalent of Thanksgiving.  It means a five-day weekend (we get a M, T, and W. off) and our only other holiday for the next long while excluding Christmas.  Korea becomes a massive traffic jam during this time as the vast majority of Koreans leave Seoul to return to their respective hometowns to spend the holiday with their family.  I don't get many long breaks so I'd like to take this opportunity to go and travel somewhere cool.  And I'm thinking about Japan.  Ever since my Osaka visa run I've been intrigued by the Land Of The Rising Sun and since it's not in my backpacking travel plans for next year I thought I should check out while I'm here in Asia.  I'm thinking of spending a couple days in Tokyo for the Chuseok holiday, but the cost may prove to be a bit of a challenge...   If Japan is notoriously expensive, than Tokyo is astronomically expensive.  Last time I heard it was the most expensive city in the world to live in, and I'm not surprised considering the preview I was given when I was in Osaka.  Accommodation is the real killer, I've been told, and I keep thinking there *must* be some cheap places to stay somewhere there.  Hostels are probably the best option, but I'm not sure what those are like over there.  I know that a hotel room is definitely out of the question, and unfortunately I don't know anyone in Japan that I can crash with for a few days.  Hmmm....  I really wanna go somewhere fun and cool but I don't want to break the bank doing it.  I'm gonna call some travel agencies here and see if I can find some cheap(er) package deals maybe, or perhaps just a half-decent airfare price.  I'm also gonna pick up the Lonely Planet: Tokyo I think to see what I can find out in there.  Good ol' LP usually has some good tips for bargain-hunters and I definitely fall into that category.  Hong Kong is another option I'm considering, but that would probably prove to be just as expensive....   Either way I don't want to just hang around here and waste a perfectly good holiday.  Since I decided to stay in Korea for my summer vacation (and I did have a blast) I figured I deserve a little out-of-country trip.  Hanging out in the world's most populous city sounds like great fun to me.  I've heard that Tokyo is tons of fun with loads of fascinating places to check out.  I'd love to join the hustle and bustle of Japan's capital for a few days, but I guess we'll see if I can afford it...

      So the good news is that my former problem child in my class of pre-schoolers, Eugene, has been a peach the last couple of weeks.  The bad news is that another one of my kids is proving to be much more challenging than she ever was!  Ever since we put Eugene on a star-chart program, where I award her with stars in various categories for her behaviour, she has almost done a 180.  She's had a few small minor cries here and there but there hasn't been a big tantrum since - and that's been a huge relief for me, that's for sure!!  The odd time she has cried, she'll cry a bit for like a few minutes, but then she stops and she's all smiles again.  Such great progress - go Eugene!!  My current challenge in the class is a student named Hae Keun (pronounced Hay-Gun.)  He was a bit of a pain before, right from the beginning, but it has progressively gotten worse.  Hae Keun proves to be difficult to manage for several reasons.  He's very energetic and enthusiastic in class, but sometimes this proves to be more of a curse than a blessing.  He's a bit bigger than the other kids and when he gets really excited he tends to want to run around, flail his arms, or jump, and he often mows down a kid or two in the process!  Almost daily I have to comfort other crying children who've been unlucky enough to be in Hae Keun's path when he's got a burst of energy.  I had been warned about this ahead of time, and try to prevent it, but it's hard to try and keep him calm and maintain his enthusiasm for learning at the same time.  The main problem is Hae Keun's temper.  Like Eugene, he also doesn't like to hear the word 'no', and gets very angry when he doesn't get his way.  Unlike Eugene's screaming and crying, Hae Keun tends to act out by yelling at the top of his lungs, stomping his feet, hitting a student, or throwing an object across the room.  Again, because of his size, this can result in other kids getting hurt.  He's also extremely sensitive to the other kids and the slightest tease or taunt from another student can send him into Angry Yelling Mode.  This definitely wears down on my patience (and my ears) each and every day.  He doesn't like to listen to teachers (myself or any of the others) and sometimes, upon being scolded, either begins to cry or refuses to do anything but sit and pout the rest of the class.   I've tried a few tactics with him but must admit that I haven't had much luck.  In fact, it seems that his temper is actually getting worse.  I had to take him out of the class today and have a chat with him in the hallway about his temper tantrums, and this actually seemed to work quite well.  However, I can't be doing this every day and need to come up with a better solution.  I'm thinking of trying the star chart system with him too, and actually I'm strongly considering having it as a Parrots Class daily solution.  I may as well get all of the kids on it and see how it turns out.  It would be great if this was as successful with Hae Keun as it was with Eugene!  I love my pre-schoolers but they definitely wear me out.  Four blocks with them everyday is a lot and by 1:30pm I'm happy to see them off.  I've realized that I much prefer teaching the older kids (they listen better, there is much less classroom management, and the more advanced material is fun to teach) but I've got my pre-schoolers for the next year so I've got to find some new tricks for the classroom.  Calling all teachers...any suggestions?

      How absolutely wonderful it was, this morning, to be able to wake up not the sound of an alarm, or noisy kids outside my apartment, or propaganda trucks cruising up and down the street, but instead to the calm, soothing sound of waves crashing against the beach.  Now *this* is how to spend a weekend!  All the Koreans had left last yesterday afternoon and none of them had returned.  We literally had an entire beach all to ourselves and it was amazing!  (This is quite a stupendous feat in itself, as finding a quiet piece of real estate to relax in ALONE is near impossible in this crowded little country.)  It was great to be able to sleep in a bit and then relax on the beach and enjoy the solitude.  Our solitude didn't last too long as we were all anxious to jump back into our Survivor game and find out who would win.  After Nick's build-up last night we were expecting some sort of back-breaking triathalon to compete in today but it ended up being a fairly simple challenge.  Pauline, Angele and myself had to run the length of the beach and back again - backwards.  We weren't allowed to turn around at any point to see where we would be going and the winner of this challenge would win Immunity, meaning they'd advance to the final round and get to choose who'd be going to join Nick in the jury, and who'd get a chance at a cool million dollars cash....errrr.....free dinner I mean.  ;-)  I figured that I totally had this challenge in the bag, with my unnaturally long legs and all, but fate had other things in store...  As soon as the race started Angele shot out of there like a cannon, and considering that she's only five feet tall, she blasted down that beach!!  I was about two sleps behind her the whole way and just could not catch up it seemed!  (Pauline was waaaayyy behind, eating our sand dust.)  The first leg was already completed and I still had done nothing to catch up with that little jackrabbit Angele!  In the last stretches of the race I really just started GIVIN' 'ER and was only like one step behind Angele but she crossed the finish line ahead of me and was once again awarded with Immunity!  Wow, this is one competitive little girl!  Pauline and I then had to tell Angele why she should take each of us to the Final Two, and in the end she ended up choosing...ME!!!!   YAH!!!!  So it was now Scotty & Angele in the Final Two with Nick &amp; Pauline making up the jury.  This was the last part of the game, so now Angele and I had to give long-winded, poetic, Oscar-winning speeches about our valiant efforts in the game, our illustrious virtues and admirable characters, and our desires for striving in competition, setting a good example 'for the kids', and dreams of world peace all just to try and woo the Jury into picking us to win....  Who would it be...?  Pauline & Nick went off to the far end of the beach to have a private pow-wow and make their decision.  They took a long time to decide and from a distance Angele and I could see that they were having a hard time making their choice.  They finally came back and revealed their selection...  The official winner and soul survivor of Survivor: Deokjeokdo was....  ....ANGELE!!!  Okay so no, I didn't win, but hey second place ain't bad, right?  (Yes there were only four of us playing this game so it wasn't that amazing to get this far, but hey let me enjoy my moment, k?)  ;-)  Angele did a little Happy Dance on the beach and then we went for a swim to cool down and relax.  After that it was unfortunately time to pack everything up.  We bid farewell to our own little private beach and unanimously agreed that we this beach was even nicer than our weekend last week at Myeongsa Beach on Geojedo Island!  I'll definitely be coming back to this beach sometime....  We headed to the ferry terminal, had some lunch, and then sailed back to the mainland.  After that we went into Itaewon and had a really yummy dinner at Outback restaurant.  Angele enjoyed her free dinner and the four of us recounted our glorious weekend on that beautiful island.  We all had such a blast this weekend and I can't wait for the next camping trip!  P.S.  We've also planned to have a 'Survivor: Deokjeokdo - AllStars!' in early September by gathering up all our friends and having a BIG Survivor weekend with lots of cool challenges.  Now how much fun will *THAT* be!!???  I totally plan on winning that game!  :-)

      Oh boy, another 'Dear God is it time to get up already?' early start today!!  The alarm went off at 6am and it was time for the four of us to get up and get ready to head out to catch our bus.  I felt like death warmed over - again - today and I think my whole body was starting to resent me!  It can forgive me for one no-sleep night, but two in a row?  Uh-uh....   There was a bit of a confusion when we got to Seoul Station as to where and when to catch our bus...  We had been giving conflicting schedules from two different sources, and there was like no signage in the area where we had to wait for the bus....  My contribution to sorting out all of this uncertainty was to lay down on the bus stop and sleep.  (Again, another first for me!)  Finally our bus came and we boarded it and headed for the ferry terminal which is way out in Incheon.  (And guess what I did on the bus the whole way there?  Yep, you got it - S-L-E-E-P!)   When we got to the ferry terminal in Incheon we discovered that the boat that we wanted to catch had already been sold out.  We'd have to wait another two and a half hours for the next one.  Argh!!  We had some lunch (I ate my new favourite Korean dish - chumchi kimchi chigae, which is tuna and kimchi soup) to kill time and then hung out in the ferry terminal for a while.  The ferry terminal was absolute mayhem and not a fun place to be.  It was completely packed and the whole idea of 'queueing up for tickets' merely seemed like a fun, idealistic concept here.  Boats were selling out left right and centre as everybody and their dog (and there were may dogs there actually) were dying to get out of the city for the weekend.  The ferry ride was about an hour long or so and took us out to the island of Deokcheokdo - a small hilly island 77 km. off the coast of Korea in the Yellow Sea.  We arrived at D. and were so happy to have finally made it!  We were all tired and cranky and hot from the crowded terminal and ferry ride and were so anxious to hit that beach!  My camping companions have all been to D before and knew of some special beach that hardly anyone ever goes to that's supposed to be really beautiful.  Having never been to this island before, I just went along with the ride...  The beach was only a short 15 minute bus ride away from the ferry terminal and let me tell you, it was a little slice of paradise here in Korea!  The entrance to the beach is not well-marked at all and you have to climb down a wooded embankment to get to it so I can see why it's not popular with the Koreans.  But it's secluded, clean, and absolutely gorgeous!  It's banked in on each side by large rocky cliffs, the sand is soooo soft and white, the water is clean, and you're awarded with a beautiful view of the sea and offshore islands.  Magnificent!  We set up our tents right on the beach and made ourselves at home.  We spent the day laying in the sun, reading, and swimming in the refreshing ocean waters.  Nick had brought along a fishing rod and attempted to catch some dinner but didn't have any luck.  There was a town just up the road so we ended up going there for dinner.  It was a lively, charming little town with a variety of inviting restaurants so we strolled around for a bit before plunking ourselves down at one.  The owner immediately welcomed us there and chatted us up.  We ended up having a really super dinner there and shared two bottles of soju and became rather silly as the night wore on!   When we got back to the beach we were even more silly and hyper and so we decided to turn the weekend into a Survivor weekend!  We thought it would be great fun to make up some challenges and then vote someone off at the end of each game, and then see who, at the end of the weekend, would become the soul survivor of Survivor: Deokcheokdo!  The winner would receive a free dinner in the city on Sunday night and we all thought this would be a blast!   Our first challenge would be an intellectual one, so we set up a bonfire and then broke out the ol' Scrabble game.  I ended up losing (usually I rock at Scrabble!) and Angele won and was therefore awarded with the much-coveted title of Immunity.  Knowing that the next day's challenge was going to a physical one, none of us wanted to be matched up against Nick, who is very strong and athletic, so the three of us deciced to vote him out!  He was outta the game so fast he didn't know what hit him!!!  In exchange though he got to make up the physical challenge for the next day and spent the rest of the night taunting us with how hard and strenuous he was going to make it!  LOL  We spent the rest of the night goofing around the bonfire and even had our own impromptu Shamanism ritual!  This was in direct response to the signs that we saw last week in Geojedo that banned shamanism on the beach - (see my splashbulb pics to check that one out) and we took a few really hilarious silly photos of ourselves dancing around the fire, chanting, with sticks! (as well as a basket, some scissors, and some rope that I found on the beach and thought made *great* shamanism props!)  After wearing ourselves out with the shamanism, we eventually went to bed and I slept like the dead that night!!

      After only a mere three or so hours of sleep, I woke up at 7AM today feeling like *absolute shit.*  I felt like I hadn't slept at all.  I felt like I had been run over by a squid truck who then decided to back over me a couple more times just for shits and giggles.  I felt....TIRED!  But hey this was no surprise at all, right?  This is what you get, Mr. Erdman, when you stay out way past your bedtime on a school night!  I wasn't even hung over (cause I had barely drank anything last night) but it was just from sheer lack of sleep.  *tisk tisk*  (gives self a disapproving grimace)  Jeremy lives in SE Seoul and luckily near the Orange Line.  I caught a train and rode all the way back to Ilsan and it was a looooong ride.  But, for the first time ever in my life, I slept on the subway!  I've always been way too paranoid to sleep on the subway (even though, on any average day, a good third or so of your fellow passengers in your subway car will be sleeping.)  This is not for reasons due to concerns regarding my personal safety, but mainly cause I'd be afraid that I'd wake up too late and not only be way past my stop, but be on the same train heading the *opposite way* back down the line again!  But, today my exhaustion won over and I slept most of the ride home on that train.   And luckily I did not miss my stop!  I got off the subway and decided to walk the rest of the way to work, thinking that the fresh air (ie: hot humid stale grossy sticky smoggy furnace-like air) would wake me up.  It helped a little, but not much.  Friday turned out to be the longest day at work in the history of mankind.  I was okay for the morning, but by the time afternoon came I was barely hanging in there.  It took several cups of coffee and a whole lot of patience, extreme focusing, and some fancy mind-over-matter tricks to make it through the day, but I did - and no one was the wiser about it.  7:30pm came and I was thrilled (or would've been thrilled, but was too tired to even know how to spell the word 'thrilled') that the day was over.  I had made plans to go camping again this weekend with Pauline, Nick and Angele so I went home and packed up all my gear.  I had some dinner, relaxed a bit, and actually wasn't feeling too tired after all.  Brian wasn't going to be able to come out this weekend, but I borrowed a bunch of his gear, met up with Pauline, and we subwayed it into Seoul to meet up with Nick & Angele.  Nick & Angele live only a few stops away from where Jeremy lives so that subway ride was totally dejavu from the morning (only no sleeping this time!)  Pauline and I had been invited to crash at N&A's because our bus to the ferry terminal was leaving bright and early and they live much closer to it than we do.  Nick and Angele live in a really cool, spacious apartment in a very 'Korea' neighbourhood - steep hills, windy alleys, dirty unnamed streets, hodgepodge buildings, a few highrise apartment towers soaring above clusters of old-style housing, and random snapshot vistas of the Seoul landscape.  Super cool.  The four of us ended up staying up a bit to hang out and chat (where this energy was coming from in me, nobody knows, cause at this point I was defying all laws of physics just by staying awake) and eventually went to bed around 2am.  We'll see how I feel tomorrow morning, eh?  ;-)

      So I was at work late tonight using the school computers to upload a bunch of photos onto my splashbulb site (my home computer is too slow for this kinda thing) and was also using Messenger to kill time inbetween.  A new friend of mine, Jeremy, came online and wanted to know what I was up to that night.  Citing that I did indeed have no plans, he invited me out to join him and some other friends for some drinks at a bar in Itaewon.  I don't often go out on 'school nights' (actually almost never) but I haven't been Out & About in a while and thought, 'what the hell!'  I ran home, wolfed down some dinner, cleaned myself up, and then subwayed it all the way into Itaewon.  By the time I got down there it was after 10:30pm at night - quite late already (considering that transit stops in about an hour!)  I couldn't find the bar at first but eventually I found Jeremy and he took me on over to Helios where all his buddies were.  This was my first visit to Helios and it was pretty cool.  It's quite a popular bar in Itaewon and busy all weekend long.  Thursday is Ladies Night so all girls get free drinks...damn girls!  Why don't guys ever get Boys Night free drinks?  Argh!  :-)  Luckily Jeremy's roomie Becky was there and so she just went and retrieved drinks for us for free from the bar all night.  Right on Becky!  It ended up being a really, really FUN night!  Jeremy's friends were all cool and it was just one of those nights where everyone was so friendly and you made lots of 'bar buddies' for the night!  The coolest part of the night was when I was standing having a Tom Collins (the first since I've arrived in Korea!  DEAR GOD SIX MONTHS IS A LONG TIME TO HAVE TO GO WITHOUT MY FAVOURITE DRINK!!!) with Jeremy & Co. when all of a sudden this guy who I've never seen before came right up to me and said "Hey you!!  Aren't you the guy from The Contenders!??  Dude, I saw you on TV!!!"   I had to give him a big smile, laugh and say, "yes, yes that's me, yes you did see me on TV!" (cause really, how many times do we *actually* get to say that in real life??)  LOL!  He was super excited to chat with me and wanted to know all about the show, how I got on it, what it was like being on stage, etc. etc.  I was more than pleased to indulge him with all of his questions, while Jeremy and the gang looked onwards in surprise and disbelief at me eating up every bit of my 15 seconds of fame.  (They hadn't known until that moment that I had been on the show.)  For the rest of the night I was teased about being a 'Local Celebrity' and we all got a good laugh out of it!  We made lots of new friends tonight (including a really cool girl that I met who was from Abbotsford, we exchanged phone numbers) and we spent most of the night dancing away to all the fun tunes on the dancefloor.  After Helios we changed venues and Jeremy and I and our whole entourage/group of new friends for the night went to another bar across the street called The Loft which was practically dead but still fun.  I didn't have that much to drink but was starting to crash by the time we got here...  Next thing I knew it was after 2:30am and I was DEAD TIRED and more than a bit fearful about having to wake up early for work the next day.  By the time we got back to Jeremy's and went to sleep it was probably close to 4am I think....   OH GOD tomorrow's gonna be a rough day!!  What a really awesome fun night but I *know* that I'm going to pay for it royally tomorrow!  Ahh well, I'm a good boy (most nights, but not tonight!) and am allowed to have a naughty night out once in a while staying up well past my bedtime.  Here's hoping I can make it through the day!  Ack!

      ...Will Get You Everywhere.  No, I'm not being flirtatious with you (well, maybe some of you!) but this is what I saw on the t-shirt of one of my Grade 5 students today!!!  I totally did a double take when I saw it and had to read it like three times just to make sure.  I also had to suppress my laughter everytime I looked at her!  The funniest thing about it is that the student who was wearing it, Nicole, is a rather polite, shy, and quiet girl.  Not the kind of trollup-in-training (like some of my other students) that I'd expect that from!   The truth is I honestly think that sweet lil Nicole really had no idea what the words on her shirt meant.  Yes, she can read (quite well actually, she's an advanced student) but she would definitely not know the sexual connotation that message carries (quite direct actually, if you ask me!)   Koreans are *obsessed* with wearing clothing that contains English words on it.  It's the hot trend these days here in Korea - shirts, hats, pants, purses, belts, just about anything really fashionable these days has some form of English on it.  The strange thing is that in most cases the words are either mis-spelled or don't make any grammatical sense - at all!  Hell, half the time they just seem to be random English words strewn together in hap-hazard manner all over the piece of clothing.  Even jeans has words written all up and down the sides - there's no escape!  This proves to be quite hilarious for us weguks who can actually read *and* understand what the words say!  I get quite a giggle from walking through Seoul crowds and checking out all the random English all over the place.  And this just doesn't apply to clothes, but stationary, signage, store brand names, company slogans, billboard advertisements...you name it...it's got English on/in it here in Korea.  English is hot and sexy and popular in Korea, and a powerful selling agent, even if people have no idea what the words mean.  Here's a few funny examples:  -Pocari Sweat - a popular brand of sports drink very similar to Gatorade  -Man And Woman Love Bakery - this is not far from where I live  -I'm 13! - the name of the English school located across the street from POLY  -the garbage can in my bathroom says "Fine.  This can be used for varoius purposes."  (Thanks for the clarification!  I wasn't sure what to do with it!)  -Are You Type 1? - a popular slogan I've seen on shirts lately (just what the hell is Type 1?)  -ESL brand milk - I'm glad to know that it's not just foreigners here in Korea that are busy teaching English to Koreans!  -I don't remember the name but there's a brand of ice cream that uses a big fat pig as it's mascot - not a great choice of imagery - 'Eat this ice cream and you'll turn into a pig!'  -2% - a tasty watery-peach juice drink whose slogan is "Drenching Body & Heart" (and just what, exactly, is it 2% of?  Real fruit juice? Sugar? The percentage of people who drink this beverage that actually understand our slogan and therefore think it's funny?)  -Baby Hunt - a popular chain of stores that sell baby clothes - personally I'd be kinda scared to take my baby there!  -Run Around Naked - another popular slogan I've seen on t-shirts lately?  (Seriously?  Do you *really* wanna see me naked running around these streets?  No?  Then don't tell me to do it!)  haha....  Anyways there's tons more but those are just a few that came off the top of my head.  I should start a list of all the funny English that I see here in Korea (unofficially this is actually called Konglish!)  I think this list would be all too hilarious!  :-)

      Oh man, today was SUCH a long day at work today.  You know when you have those days that just seem to drag on *forever* and that no matter how many times you look at the clock you swear it hasn't moved a millimetre?  Well today was one of those days!  It wasn't necessarily a bad day, just a really long one.  My morning was alright I guess.  My pre-schoolers kept bouncing back and forth between being good as gold to little devils.  One minute they were all colouring peacefully and quietly, the next there were like 3 fights breaking out simultaneously.  Ahhh kids - so energetic, so emotional, so unpredictable!  haha!   My afternoons usually just fly by cause they're my fave part of the day, but not today.  Today, being Tuesday, is even one of my shorter teaching days of the week, but yet it went on and on and on....  Granted most of this is because all day long today I was dead tired.  I was on the phone a lot last night (talking to a local friend, and then to Brad and Andrea ~ who are moving to Vancouver coincidentally!!  My old turf!) and then just couldn't get into a deep sleep last night.  The heat lately has been making it really hard to sleep soundly at night and I'm too cheap to keep my aircon all night long.  Getting a good sleep is rumoured to be a good thing so I should probably stop being such a cheap-ass and keep my aircon going at night, eh?  All I can say is that I wouldn't have made it through the day today if it wasn't for the desperately-needed assistance of Mr. Coffee!  Thank God for caffeine!  Some days you just really need that pick-me-up via an artificial stimulant and today definitely qualified.  Man, I am so ready for bed.  My pillow isn't merely calling, but rather *WAILING* out my name, begging me to come join it in peaceful slumber.  You don't have to ask me twice.  Goodnight, Korea!

      One of the most interesting differences between Korean and Canadian (and American too) culture, I find, is how each of the respective peoples conceptualize space.  Now I've done quite my fair share of travelling while in Korea.  Between hiking trips, camping, rafting, temple visits, mud festivals, and vacations to various offshore islands, I've covered just about every corner of this little country.  But, in a nation the size of Korea, that really isn't all that hard to do.  Korea, at just under 100,000 square kilometres, is not a very large nation.  It works out to be a bit larger than New Brunswick, or about the same size as the state of Indiana for all my Amercian readers, or the same size as Portugal for all my European fans.  Either way you look at it, that doesn't work out to be a lot of land area.  What's fascinating is two things.  One, is that the Koreans have somehow managed to squeeze close to 50 million of themselves into this little peninsula!  Wow!  No wonder it's so crowded here!  (Well, almost half of them live in Greater Seoul, so that'll free up some space elsewhere for them!)  Can you imagine would happen if we Canadians tried to put 50 million people into lil New Brunswick?  Dear God where would we put them all!??  Can you imagine?  'Welcome to Fredericton, pop. 19 million!'  Crazy!  The second point is how the Koreans don't really view their own country as being small.  To them, taking a trip across the country to visit a place, like say, Busan, is an incredible journey and adventure in itself.  To me, I'm floored that I can cross from one end of the country to the other in just under three hours.  For the Koreans, there are many, many corners of this country that they probably never make it to in their lifetime just because they view that space in a totally different perspective from us foreigners.  In their eyes travelling to the other side of Korea is FAR, and something that you don't do very often, certainly not on a weekend!  Most Koreans don't own passports and have never, and probably never will, leave Korea.  This little peninsula is all that they have ever known, and as such their idea and conception of space is shaped by those limits.  This applies to just about anyone who's from a small country (my friends in the UK are very much the same way.)   Us Canadians, wow, are we ever SPOILED when it comes to space.  I always knew this, but never fully realized it until I came to Korea, but Canada is fuckin' huge!!!  Our measely 32 or so million population lives in a area that's equal to 6% of the world's total land space.  Granted, most of that land is uninhabitable, but still, that's a lot of open wilderness!  I've driven across Canada several times and yes it is a long trip, but it doesn't seem all that arduous or crazy.  Taking four or five days to drive from Thunder Bay to the West Coast just seemed 'normal' when I was growing up.  That's what happens when you live in a ginormous nation.  The Koreans, they honestly cannot *fathom* being in a vehicle for 5 days OR MORE to drive across just one country (and that's just half of Canada!)  When I tell them that it takes about four or more hours (and not counting connections) to fly from where I was living in Canada to my hometown, they look at me like I'm joking.  In four hours of flying here, you can make it all the way to the Philippines or Vietnam!  As a result, I've often gone on weekend trips all the way across Korea cause honestly it doesn't seem all that far to me, and it's always funny to see and hear the reactions of my Korean coworkers when I tell them where I went in just a day or two.  From complete shock and wonderment to pure disbelief!  It's pretty funny actually, I think you'd be hard pressed to find two populations that have more of an *opposite* view of space and land and travel times than the Koreans and the Canadians!  It's really fascinating how geography can have such a profound influence on the culture and social constructions and spatial impressions of a nation's people.  Cool stuff.

      So I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there's a Wal-Mart near where I live here in Ilsan. Okay, not that I was actually *surprised* (Wal-Mart has stores in countries all over the world) but it's nice to know that there is one close by. I had never actually seen it before, so today I decided to step out into the furnace (aka: outdoors in Korea) to go and find it.  I have a love-hate relationship with Wal-Mart. I tended to avoid the ones in Canada. They're always ridiculously crowded, and full of white trash teen mothers pushing screaming children in strollers, deadbeat crackhead teen kids causing shit and trying to find ways to maintain their clepto lifestyles, and derelict senior citizens who move *so slowly* they might just actually be moving backwards down the aisle. Haha, that was all unnecessarily harsh, I know, but I just wanted to paint for you a clear mental picture. Can you see it now?  But damn that sneaky Wal-Mart, they're just so frickin' handy and convenient! Where else can you get like *everything* that you need for your house, all at dirt-cheap third-world child-slave-labour-sweatshop rock bottom prices? They've got you covered, and damn they know right where to hit you! 60 rolls of toilet paper for two dollars? I'm SO there! Hell that's enough toilet paper to wipe my ass for the next decade, but god dammit I really do wanna buy that much toilet paper! Consumerists of the world, unite a la Wal-Mart!  On my way to the Ilsan Wal-Mart I had no idea what to expect. Was it going to be like the ones back home? (the two that come to mind, cause I've spent the most time in them, is Thunder Bay's Wally World, and the one at Burnaby's Lougheed Mall back in me and Barbie's domestic suburban days.) Or was it going to be totally Korean, complete with squid and kimchi samples at the end of every aisle?  Turns out that whether you're in Ilsan or Indianopolis, every Wal-Mart is always perpetually crowded! All department/grocery stores in Korea are always insanely busy, but this Wal-Mart brought a whole new meaning to the concept of Grocery Aisle Road Rage. Luckily I was feeling especially patient today (maybe I'm ill?) and gently nudged my way through the sea of Koreans, like an 18th Century tall ship sailing into Boston Harbour. (Wonderfully tall, effortlessly graceful, and sure to draw stares from all on-lookers!)  And oh my, what goodies I found there! Not only did I find toilet bowl cleaner, windex, and Gillette brand Sensitive shaving cream, but I discovered Kraft Dinner imitations, a whole line of Campbell's Chunky Soup (Soup That Eats Like A Meal!) and, bless my lucky stars, BAGELS! Oh, be still my beating heart!  A wave of maddening, sinister, divinely devilish laughter swept over my body, and I went nuts, throwing in all kinds of good shit into my little basket. Oh I packed that basket full, I packed it Real Good! And it loved it! The more I shoved in it the more it begged for...more... And I didn't let it's cries go unanswered, I packed that bitch as full as I could get it, and then still I packed it even more. Muwahahahahaha!!!!  (*insert evil laugh here*)  By the time I bitch-slapped myself back to reality (mainly cause I thought my arm was going to fall off carrying that god damn demanding basket) and ran to the nearest check-out counter, I had racked up over $80 CDN worth of goodies! Oh how good it feels to be so very, very bad! ;-)  I felt like a pack mule on the way home with all that crap in my backpack, but now I've got a very full cupboard, and a very happy tummy. Thank you, Wal-Mart. Thank you for bringing me over to the dark side for a night. I'm free for a second date, *anytime* you please. :-)

      For some reason, I've really been missing home lately.  No, I'm not homesick, but just in the past day or so I've really been wishing that I could be at home right now.  Not to live, but just for a visit.  This was prompted mainly by a series of photos that my sister put up online for her friends and family to see.  My sister Janelle just came back from a two week trip home to Thunder Bay, and while she had been visiting there the family had thrown a huge party out at the family camp (cabin, cottage, whatever your particular term is) on Shebandowan.  It was a theme party - Hawaiian Luau - and it was great to see the whole fam (including Kayla, our golden retriever) dressed up in Hawaiian tropical gear, leies around their necks and all.   Janelle had a really great shot of her with Mom and Dad all dressed up and suddenly I really, really wished that I could've been there.  I don't miss living in Thunder Bay, but I do really miss being so close to my family.  We still talk often (almost weekly) which is pretty cool considering how far away I live, but I miss being able to physically spend time with them.  It's those little random everyday moments together that I miss the most.  Having dinners together, relaxing at camp or at home, family BBQ's, boat trips up the lake, watching TV together, stuff like that.   I can't really whine cause I knew what I was signing up for when I came to Korea (being away from my friends and family in Canada for a very long time) but I still can't help missing them all once in a while.  And knowing that I won't see my sister or parents until Christmas 2005 makes it kinda hard too.  By the time I see them again it will have been *two full years* since I had seen them last.  TWO YEARS!  I was 25 when I saw them last and the next time I see them I'll be 27 years old.  That's crazy!   Like I said, I don't miss living there, I just wish that I could 'drop in' for weekends or evenings here and there.  Someone *really* needs to invent some kind of instant transportation device, so that I can 'beam' myself to Thunder Bay, Vancouver, or wherever every now and then.  To go home in today's reality involves at least 13-17 hours of flying and well over a thousand dollars.  I don't have the time or the money to do that.  I just sometimes feel like time is passing by so quickly and that I'm missing so much quality family time at home.  Ahh well, again, that's the price you pay for going out and pursuing your dream, eh?  This was compounded when later that day I chatted with a couple of my friends in Vancovuer.  I had spotted Henry online on Messenger so I decided to give him a ring so we could chat for a bit.  Turns out there was a big gang of them about to go out and celebrate the Fireworks/Pride/Long Weekend/Summer Heat festivities in Vancouver.  Even my two buddies Toby & Stephen were up from Seattle and I totally wished that I could've been there to go out and party with them!  *sigh*  It's not like I'm suffering here in Korea, that's for sure!  I'm having the time of my life, no doubt about it!  Maybe there's a way that I can clone myself so that I *can* be in two places at once!  I could have Asia Scotty and then Canada Scotty!   This way I get to enjoy the best of both worlds!  Hell, if I'm going to make a second Scotty I may as well make a third, fourth, fifth and more!  I could have Euro Scotty, Aussie Scotty, Latin Scotty, Permanent Nomadic Globetrotter Scotty, Academic Scotty (ringing up several PhD's just for fun), and Workaholic Scotty (someone's gotta pay for the lifestyles of all the other Scotty's!)   Wow, now *that* would be a busy and crowded and confusing family reunion, eh?  ;-)

      We woke up this morning and packed up all our gear before heading out to catch the 11am ferry back to Busan.  The ride was calm and scenic and we pulled into dock just before noon.  We took taxis back to Busan Station and just before entering the station I actually ran into some friends!  Also coming into the station were my friends Anne-Marie and Bernie - friends of Ailish who all live out in Shihung!  The two girls were on their way to catch a ferry to Japan for their summer holiday and were about to buy tickets.  Wow - small world running into them!  Kinda funny cause I just ran into them last week at the Mud Festival!  While at the station Brian and Pauline decided that they wanted to head back to Seoul right away so they bought train tickets for the next train out and went their own way.  Nick, Angele and myself decided that we wanted to hang out in Busan for the day so we went and did our own thing, after buying tickets for a much later train.  We decided to go and hang out for the afternoon at Haeundae - Korea's most famous - and therefore most crowded - beach!  Nothing could have prepared me for the sheer size of the crowds at that beach....  We taxied it there and had some lunch before throwing ourselves into the pit of human bodies on the sand!  Haeundae is 1.25 km. long and is literally ALL UMBRELLAS!  I kid you not - there are so many people on that beach you can barely see the sand!!  There had to have been at least 50,000 people at this beach!!  Wow!  I've never seen anything like it before!!  The beach is actually really nice and is just on the edge of town so it's surrounded by a wall of skyscrapers - hotels and apartments all vying for a piece of precious ocean view.  This beach ain't cheap though!  You have to rent out the umbrellas and lounge chairs and for us three it cost about $10 CDN *EACH*!  Ouch!  Still, it was worth it.  The weather was hot and beautiful and it was cool to relax and people-watch.  And on a beach this busy there's lots to look at!  After a few hours hanging out at Haeundae it was time to head back to the train station.  We caught the 6 o'clock KTX and were whisked back up to Seoul.  I then caught a bus back to Ilsan and was home just before 10:30pm.  What a great week away!!!  Definitely one of my most fun camping trips ever and I got to see some really beautiful scenery!  Great company too, and we've even made plans already to go camping again this coming weekend!  Sweet!!!  With weather this good who can resist?  I can't wait for another camping adventure exploring pockets (the few that remain) of Korean wilderness.  Korea really is a very beautiful country!

      Today we decided to leave Myeongsa and head back up the coast to the ferry terminal.  There was some stuff on the coast we wanted to check out, and plus we were heading back to Busan the next morning so we thought it best to head up that way.  We bid goodbye to our adopted little town and beach that we had spent the week in, and took a taxi (Mr.Man With The Van again) up to Hakdang.  Hakdang was a madhouse, crawling with tourists and beach-goers so we only stayed long enough for lunch. After lunch we bussed it all the way back up to Jangseungpo and found ourselves a yagwon (motel) to spend the night in.  It felt SO GOOD to have access to a shower and to airconditioning again!  Ahhhh the pleasures and luxuries of modern life!  :-)  That evening we decided to take an ocean cruise and it was a great choice!  We boarded a boat that took us on a three-hour cruise along the island's shores and we couldn't have picked a better time of day - just before sunset!  The boat stopped for a while on this off-shore island that proved to be a pretty cool place.  It's this rocky plateau jutting out of the sea that this elderly Korean couple have turned into a massive complex full of gardens, statues, and flowers and plants of every imaginable sort!  We strolled around took some fun photos on the island and then it was back on the boat.  We then went to our main destination - Haegeumgang.  Haegeumgang is one of the most famous and most beautiful natural attractions in all of Korea.  It's a towering rocky island that soars up out of the sea into the sky.  It's jagged and very imposing and intimidating-looking, and the coolest thing about it is that it looks like it's being ripped in half.  There's a massive split right down the middle and the giant cracks allow tour boats to squeeze into the middle of this enormous rock.  Wow!  I felt that it had a very Lord Of The Rings feel to it and the light mist hovering above the water added to the mysteriousness of the whole island.  We navigated through some of the sea canyons along the island's edges before circling the whole rock.  After that we cruised back to our home port and it was completely dark by the time we got back.  After that we had some dinner and then relaxed in our motel room.  We were all pretty tired so we had an early night and were happy to sleep in an airconditioned room!  Tomorrow we have to head back to the mainland....

      Ahhhh...how great is it to wake up not to an alarm, but to the bright sunshine and the sounds of birds in the trees! And how great is it that your only decisions for the day are whether to swim now or later, eat now or later, or drink now or later. Vacation rocks! :-)  We were feeling a bit curious about other parts of the island today, so we all decided that it would be cool to go and check out one of the other beaches up the coast. Bus transportation is really slow and sporadic on Geojedo, so instead we decided to take one of the local taxis. We've been hanging out a lot at this one restaurant/convenience store/outdoor patio and have gotten to know the owners a bit, so they called the cab for us. The 'cab' turned out to be just some guy's van who drives people around on the island here and there. Cool!  We piled into the van and cruised on up the coast highway. The scenery was spectacular as we climbed up and down over hills that plunge into the sea. It was so GREEN everywhere and we had really amazing views of the sea and all the little islands that dot the horizon. Beautiful! Mr.Man who was driving the van was pretty cool. He had some great Korean pop hits blasting out of his stereo, and then all of a sudden a cover of 'Hot Stuff' came on! We all just laughed at the sudden English song and rocked out to the Donna Summer hit (currently a hit single in Korea by some Korean pop chick) as we drove along. Another totally fun, random, 'I'm in Asia and it's awesome' moments! :-)  Our destination turned out to be a bit of a disappointment. We wanted to check out another beach and castle that was nearby, but neither turned out to be very impressive. The beach was small and kinda dirty and there was a bulldozer moving sand around at one end of it. Not very peaceful! And the 'castle' turned out to be on top of some hill (the driver wasn't sure where) and difficult to get to. Considering that it was like 2000 C outside we didn't feel like any mountain climbing that day so we kaiboshed those plans. Instead he took us up a bit further up the coast to a one-horse town on the sea. We thought we saw a nice beach up the road so we got out and started our walk in the heat - man is it ever HOT in Korea these days!  Our Quest For The Beach turned out to be a wild goose chase! The 'beach' that we thought we saw up the road was just some muddy flats next to a wharf. It was smelly and rather dirty full of abandoned marine equipment, but it was quiet and there was no one around, and we had come so far, so we found a semi-half decent spot in the shade under some trees and camped out for a while. We all spent a good part of the day just relaxing and reading before we got bored of that and decided to head back to Myeongsa.  We strolled back into the nameless one-horse town and shocked everybody just by being there! We bought some snacks in the local store (I'm pretty sure this town only has ONE little store) and got plenty of stares from the locals. I guess it's not often (as in never) that they see five weguks strolling around! Hehe! We caught the bus back to Myeongsa and spent the rest of the day having beer and playing games in the shade. Good times all around!  That night we decided that we'd make a bonfire on the beach and chill out there for a while. Nick, who is an extremely resourceful man and the perfect companion on a trip like this, did all the work and called us down to present us with a nice bonfire right on the beach! Right on, Nick! It was just before sunset so we all just chilled next to the fire and watched another spectacular sunset.  After dark is when the real fun began! The inevitable happened, you know, the thing that happens on *every* camping trip, cause no camping trip would be complete without it! That is, the telling of ghost stories! haha! Everybody loves to be scared and there's nothing quite as fun or chilling as exchanging stories of horror and supernatural mystery amongst friends while in the dark dark woods. Angele had some really great scary stories, and her, as well as Pauline and Brian, who all grew up in the Maritimes, had plenty of East Coast ghost stories to share! I then shared with them my tales of living in the haunted house in New Westminster back in BC, and of course eventually told them The Scariest Story You'll Ever Hear. Many of you already know this story, and I'm pretty sure that each and every one of you who've heard it will agree fully that it indeed is the scariest story you'll ever hear in your entire life. It's scary cause it's a true story and I've told this story many times while camping and have terrified many of my friends with it. I can't tell you what it is on here (cause it's best told when in a dark room or around a campfire at night) but I think many of you can vouch for me that it's DAMN SCARY! Hehe!  After scaring the wits out of ourselves we turned the campfire conversation to other topics, including all our own travels around the globe, our thoughts on life and the universe, and our adventures in teaching in Korea. It was a really great night! One that you wish would last forever. To lay out in the sand with friends, next to a fire, under a pure black sky full of a billion stars, and to contemplate the ways and mysteries of life, it really doesn't get any better than that! :-)
