      We actually had a good day on Friday with no contractions until around midnight when they began to get really bad.  They soon discovered that I was dilated to ten and would be giving birth that night.  An ultrasound revealed that Eden was in the breach position and the safest option for the babies was a cesarean section.  Things moved quickly from that point and the girls were born at 3:02am weighing just over a pound each. They were taken straight to the  urlLink NICU  for care and were moved into  urlLink isolettes .

      I began having contractions Monday night around 11pm and we ended up going to  urlLink St. Joseph Mercy Hospital .  They did an ultrasound right away and discovered that we were having twins! Amazingly shocking for us as I am sure you can imagine.  Soon after that we got the bad news.  I was already dilated to 4 cm and we were only 23 weeks 6 days into the pregnancy!!!

      It's hard to know where to start.  Those of you who know me, know that I've been wanting and waiting to have a baby for several years.  Up until last summer, John's reply was always "I am a kid, how am I supposed to RAISE kids?"  I finally convinced him that we'll always feel like kids and that this might even help in trying to raise them.  We started "trying" to get pregnant at the end of last summer shooting for a late spring, early summer baby that would fit well into our schedule.  I got pregnant really quickly only to suffer a miscarriage at 7 weeks.  After a couple more failed attempts, I made an appointment with a reproductive endocrinologist and we decided to take it easy for a couple of months.  The following month, just after John's birthday, we discovered I was pregnant yet again.  This time, everything progressed normally and I experienced the full range of pregnancy symptoms from extreme exhaustion to neverending nausea for the first 12 weeks.  Around 16 weeks I began to feel pretty great and started getting a bit of a belly.  It grew quite quickly from that point on and I absolutely loved it, especially around 20 weeks when I could really feel the babies moving (though at that time I thought it was just one baby).  John and I had talked extensively about the type of birth experience that we wanted to have, and did a lot of research, before deciding that a home birth was the best option for us.  We went to  urlLink New Moon Midwifery  and saw midwives, Mickey, Merilynne, and Amanda, for excellent prenatal care.  I excercised and ate right and took very good care of myself.  Throughout it all I suppose I thought I had things under control.  Guess I have learned quite a lesson since then.  It's just like Forrest Gump says, "Life is like a box of chocolates.  You never know what you're gonna get."

      Eden had the PDA surgery and everything went very well.  It took only 15 minutes for the actual procedure and she is now recovering nicely.  We got to see her around 5:30 today post surgery.  She looks peaceful but it was a little scary for me to see her so still from the sedation that she was given.  I guess I should keep in mind that it is better to see her like that than to see her in pain.  The incision is under her arm between some ribs.  It is only about 1.5 cm but it looks big on her!  Right now she has a  urlLink chest tube  in the incision to drain any excess fluids.  That should come out in 24 to 48 hours then she should be able to transfer back to St. Joe's to be with her sister.    Holland had a really awesome day today.  She is being weaned off of Dopamine and is holding her blood pressure up nicely.  The humidity in her isolette was turned off and her body temp has been steady as well.  Her platelette counts have been stable without having to receive any transfusions since Monday.  Today the line in her belly button was taken out and a  urlLink PIC line  was put in and worked great with just one attempt.  I was very happy about that because I just hate when they have to be poked!  The nurses at St. Joe's have been really supportive, compassionate, and thorough in their care of our babies.  Holland has had the same nurse pretty consistently during the day and we feel really secure leaving Holland in RuthAnn's care.  She is great!

       We had a nice surprise today while visiting Eden. The  urlLink respiratory therapist  came by to help her nurse Natasha suction Eden. They put the top to the Omnibed up and we were able to get a good look at our baby without looking through plastic. She chose the perfect time to open up both of her eyes and look up at us. We talked to her and we like to think that she looked right at her mom and dad. We told her what a good girl she is and how pretty she looks with her eyes open. It was a really awesome moment for both of us and we got some really cute pictures of her looking at us.

      Yesterday evening Eden was transferred to U of M to wait for heart surgery to close the open ductus. We didn't get to ride in the ambulance because it was full. A team of three rode with her a neonatologist, respiratory therapist, and a nurse. She did really well on the ride over and settled in nicely at the  urlLink Holden NICU . They put her back on the oscillator and she now just has to sit tight and wait. We like the NICU there. They have Eden in a really high-tech isolette called a  urlLink Giraffe . The nurse said they run about $35,000 a piece. She is a cool nurse. She did Eden's first foot and hand prints for us. They also weighed her and she is up to 1 lb 8 oz! After getting familiar with our new surroundings and making sure Eden was settled we headed back once more to St. Joe to check on Holland and see how she is handling her sister not being there. It was a late night. Long and exhausting...  Today I left work to see Holland during my lunch break and everything is going good. She is doing well except a bit temperamental whenever the nurses reach into the isolette. Once Mom (Billie) shows up and puts her hands on her she is very calm. They weighed her yesterday and she is a whopping 1 lb 7 oz! She is gaining little by little but they tell us to take it with a grain of salt as they are pumping a lot of fluids into her. They also tell us that her platelets are at 124,000, up from yesterday's count of 111,000. This is good. Billie called U of M and they said Eden had a good night. They still haven't heard when the surgery will be. We are waiting patiently...

      Based on today's echocardiogram Dr. Weiner tells us that Eden's ductus is still open ( urlLink PDA ). It appears that the 3 rounds of indomethacin helped to make it smaller but it did not close all the way. She will have to have surgery to have a clamp put into place. We were so hopeful that it would close. No such luck. For some reason they don't do the surgery at St. Joseph so she will have to be transferred to either U of M Hospital in Ann Arbor or Children's Hospital of Michigan in Detroit. Dr. Weiner says that there are really good doctors at both but that he believes it would be wiser for her to go the short distance to U of M instead of a long ride out to Detroit. For the ride over they will have to take her off the  urlLink oscillator  and put her back on the  urlLink conventional ventilator  which she did not do so well on. We agree that the shorter trip seems like a better idea even though she may not be able to be transferred back. I guess U of M likes to keep them whereas Children's always sends them back. This is somewhat disheartening as we really don't want to separate the girls. We will see what happens. Hopefully after the surgery on Thursday she will be able to come back. Although Holland may be joining her shortly if the drugs don't work to close her PDA.

      Holland took a turn for the worse on the evening of August 5th.  Her  urlLink platelet  count dropped rather suddenly and the doctors indicated that they suspected she had an infection.  Her platelet count was between 10,000 and 11,000.  A normal range is between 140,000 and 450,000, so the drop was extrememly significant.  Following a blood culture we found out that she was infected with a "gram negative rod" and they began treating her with some broad spectrum antibiotics to treat that type of bacteria.  We eventually found out that the bacteria was called Enterobacter Clocae and the antibiotics were changed to target that bacteria.  On the night of the 5th Dr. Ivacko thought it would be a good idea to sample some spinal fluid to make sure it was not infected as this would change the length of treatment. They attempted a  urlLink lumbar puncture  (spinal tap) but were not successful in obtaining any fluid.  The morning of the 6th we called the hospital to check in and found that things were not going well.  Dr. Everett informed us that Holland's platelet counts were still extremely low and that at any point things could go downhill.  We rushed to the hospital early that morning and stayed all day.  This was a very emotionally draining day for me as I really began to contemplate the fact that one or both of my babies might not make it.  Over the course of 3 or 4 days Holland received several transfusions of platelets and packed red blood cells.  She also received 2 doses of  urlLink immunoglobulin .  The 6th and 7th were really long stressful days and we didn't get a lot of good news regarding Holland's condition.  Her platelet counts would crawl up to the mid 20's, then drop again into the teens.  It was very disheartening.  Finally on the morning of the 8th we were overjoyed to get good news.  Platelets were up to 140,000!  Through it all Holland was a really tough cookie.  All of her tiny little parts continued to function and she plugged right along...

       Today Eden took a long nap on Mom during her first  urlLink kangaroo  session.  Both Mom & baby really enjoyed it.  Billie also got to give Holland a little bath this afternoon.  She washed her hair and brushed it.  Dad got to change Eden's diaper :)  Dr. Ivacko reported that Holland's  urlLink PDA  is "tiny" and will not require surgery for the time being.  We are really happy about that.  Also another head ultrasound was done today for Holland and what they thought was a grade 2 brain bleed ( urlLink IVH ) from Tuesdays ultrasound was gone!!!

      Hi everybody!  I know you have all been anxiously awaiting an update, so here it is...  Holland is doing excellent.  She loves laying on her belly and cozying up in the lamb's wool.  She looks really comfy and occasionally wiggles about.  She's even wiggled out of her diaper and off of her bed on occasion!  Holland has continued on really low vent settings and as long as all goes well, we are looking to try the CPAP again soon.  Her weight today was up to 1 lb 10 oz and the difference is noticeable.  She actually looks big to us!  They are still detecting a small  urlLink PDA .  An  urlLink echocardiogram  tomorrow will show how big it is and will help to make decisions regarding whether she is going to need the ligation surgery.  As long as it continues the same with no clinically significant flow through it, and no symptoms, or if it gets smaller or closes, she will not need the surgery.  If it gets larger she will need it.  We found out yesterday that Holland also has a grade 2  urlLink IVH  in her left ventricle.  We're really hoping the bleeding will resolve without any lasting problems for both girls.  So for all those praying out there keep this in mind.  Eden was transferred back to St. Joe's on Monday afternoon around 1pm.  We were so happy to see the team from St. Joe's walk through the door at the U.  It felt like they were coming to take her home!  She got great care at U of M, but it is so much nicer to have them together again.  It is also a lot easier for us visiting at only one hospital.  Eden is doing good since her return.  Today she began  urlLink feeding .  Her weight is down to around 1 lb 4 oz, but within the next week I expect that she will be fully recovered.  Eden also got to lay on her belly for the first time today.  She loved it as much as Holland does!  Eden's  urlLink bilirubin  level was high on her return (up to 16), so she has been on  urlLink phototherapy  for the past couple of days.  Today it was down to 6.6 so the lights should come off by tomorrow morning.  They would like it to be below 5.  You can't really tell in the pictures, but Eden is quite a fuzzy little girl ( urlLink lanugo ).  Her hair seems to grow by the day.  The hair on her head is dark and is starting to flip out around the edges.  She's quite a cutie!  Of course they both are.  In fact everything they do is cute.  They may even be the cutest babies ever.  Could I be partial???  I think not...

       Today was a good day for both of our daughters.  The most exciting part was that we got to do  urlLink Kangaroo Care  with Holland!  This is where you hold your baby against your bare skin all wrapped together with warm blankets so your baby can get to know you better.  I held her for a half hour before her Daddy held her.  We'll start doing this on a regular basis once the girls are stable enough.  Thanks so much to Holland's nurse, Kim, for helping us make it happen!  It was a very fulfilling experience and helped us feel even more connected to our baby.   They took Holland off of her ventilator today and tried out a  urlLink CPAP .  Instead of breathing for her, this is a machine that holds some pressure in her lungs as she takes her own breaths.  She stayed on it for about 20 minutes, but had to go back to the ventilator because she just wasn't breathing enough.  She is on caffeine to stimulate more breathing on her own, and we'll try CPAP again in a few days.  Holland also began  urlLink feeding  today.  Yay!  Finally a use for all that stored breastmilk!  It makes me feel good to know that I am able to do something to help make her strong.  Eden's chest tube was removed today and she will be returning to St. Joe's to be with her sister tomorrow.  We're very ready to have her come back.  She had a rough day on Friday trying to recuperate from her surgery.  She was having some difficulty with her blood pressure being too low ( urlLink hypotension ) and was given several medications to raise it.  Hydrocortisone, which is given as a last resort, finally worked, but has actually raised it a bit high.  We've been worried about that the past couple of days, but the nurses assure us that it is okay and not too high at this point.  We also found out on Friday that her doctors at U of M did a head ultrasound prior to surgery on Thursday and found that she has a grade 2  urlLink intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) , also known as bleeding in the brain.  We've been reassured by Dr. Weiner that most Grade 1 and 2 bleeds resolve on their own with no lasting effects, but it makes us nervous nonetheless.  A followup ultrasound, which was done 24 hours post-surgery showed that there has been no change, so I guess that is a good sign that it hasn't gotten worse.  Hopefully over the next few days we'll be able to report that there's been improvement.  The good news is that Eden came off the oscillator yesterday and is back on the conventional ventilator and doing well.  She really is moving in the right direction!
