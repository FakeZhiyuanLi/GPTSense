       There are times when I wish to throw my laptop against the wall. Out a window. Off from the top of the Aloha Tower. Crashing down to nothingness.  Sometimes it's worth getting upset, sometimes it worth exacting revenge. Right now, I just want something that works...

       Wonderful start of a weekend... Working two hours later than usual and ending up not going out. No movies, no pool, no nothing. Nada to do, except the juvenile glee of squashing spyware and the excrutiating chore of expunging spam. Can't wait to see how the rest of the weekend goes...

       So I came across an article mentioning  urlLink the best and worst American cities for dating . I'm happy to say that Honolulu, Hawaii is ranked in the best cities group, but unfortunately at the very bottom. What was quite the funny, though in spite of this fact, is the following:    "Honolulu has the lowest number of lingerie shops per capita,  probably because no one's wearing much clothing to begin with ."    Yeah. I suppose, all I have to do is move into town and get my groove going baby. Ahah!

       Just signed up to test out the new features and jazzy cool that I've heard about blogger. So far, it's cool. A bit like dipping your big toe in the recreational park's swimming pool and not like eating stale bacon from a five hour old half-eaten breakfast.  The only remaining question is, will I have the drive and desire to continue writing, to come up with anything worth blabbering about within the sludge of my mind.

       Dominating the silence with her grace. I shiver at her touch and tremble at her kiss. Ecstatic tears flow down my face.  Her scorching red hair is hard to miss. Satin skin, perfection at its best. Penetrating green eyes, promises hours of bliss.  We embrace, a love-born tangled mess. I kiss her softly, along her jawline. The small of her back, curving to my gently caress.  I am hers and she is mine, A mantra we repeat with eachother's lust. We raise our release to a level so sublime.  Yet reality awakens me and crumbles my vision of her to dust.

       Blogging is like day old bread. Now that more articles ( urlLink like this one ) has hit Hawaii, blogging is no longer an archaic thing. It's familiar, it's a household item... it's no longer novelty. My parents or aunts or uncles or much older cousins no longer say &#8220;Blog, whazzat?&#8221; Instead, they each have one. And the ones like me have twentibillion blogs.  So, if it's pass&eacute;, why do I keep it up? Why not shake it and go with the next beeg thing? Well, first thing is blogging isn't pass&eacute;, it's just mainstream now. Not exactly &#8220;day old bread&#8221; in a negative connotation, rather something prosaic. Second, I hate my voice, so audio blogging is out, and I rarely use my phone to take pictures, thus moblogging is also a no-go. Blogging is a comfortable, albeit infrequent method of escapism&#8212;or as of late, ranting and raving&#8212;for me.  Hawaii's catching on... and it's about damn time too, the party's been underway for several years now. :P

       The only good thing about Mondays is that once it's past, survivability for the rest of the week is high. The worst part of Mondays is just getting through it in the first place.  Speaking of which, if a 6 car accident this morning is any indication, Monday mornings suck.

       The weekend a bit bland. The work week approaches. My Saturday was nothing but sleep and video games as I recuperated from my first exercise jaunt in ages. Albeit, the event was three days prior. Today half of it gone in a puff of smoke, the other half threatens to vanish when I must wash my car. Oh well, no exciting adventure today... Unless you count Front Mission 4 as an adventure.

       Last night I went out to a sports bar where I shot some pool and slammed some shots of scotch. The pool tables are smaller than I'm used to and the cue sticks weren't all that great. It was a challenge, but I did better than I thought I'd do... which isn't really saying much.  All in all though, I'm glad I checked it out. Good alcohol, nice sights and great camaraderie.

       Yesterday's excursion to my first ever (in months) basketball session with friends was both nice and unnerving. First, one of the bad. Driving on the H1 freeway, I sped a little above speed limit. Going past the Airport, I'm switching over one lane to my right and as I scan for any cars that might be in my way, I noticed a dude in a pickup truck looking at me, then he speeds up and looks forward. Now, I can understand if I was merging into the lane he was in, or the lane he wanted to merge into also thus giving me his &#8220;stink eye,&#8221; but that was not the case. As it seems, he either heard my engine revving or noticed my speed boost or both and thought &#8220;Ooh, I've got a race going!&#8221; Well, I'm still going at moderate since I was in no mood to be dumb and he ends up being about five car lengths ahead. Fine, I thought and kept going.  My off ramp coming, I switch over another lane to my right. As soon as I do this, the truck swerves into the lane I was in. Yes, he was still five car lengths ahead. No, there were no other cars near us. Great, he's  actin' . We're off the freeway now on Nimitz highway and we stop at the first traffic light. He's in the left lane, a car is in the middle lane and I'm in the right lane. Once the light turns green, truck speeds off and as soon as he gets about three car lengths ahead, idles down for me to &#8220;catch up.&#8221; I do this, then he speeds up again but having to slam his breaks or risk smashing into the car in front of him (which is among a group of cars in the left and middle lane). With the right lane pretty clear, I'm just cruising by. Once I cleared the mass of vehicles, I switched over to the left lane and lo and behold, I see the truck swerving back and forth trying to get untangled from the mess. By then, the three lanes become four and instead of staying in either the far right or second to the right lane, he speeds into the lane next to mine, intent on passing me. Now, I've got a 200hp VR6 with 195lb-ft of torque at 3200rpm. She may not be the fastest, but she go when I need it. I was in need of it then.  She easily kept up in front of the truck, forcing the bastard to get behind me. In a few seconds I was five car lengths in front of him and kept that up no matter how hard he tried to catch up. Not being into stupid stuff, I sure did it like a champ. Anyway, I got near my destination and slowed to normal speed, merged into normal traffic and kicked myself into chill mode. What does truck do? He did his speed and swerve to get through the traffic and almost hitting another car as he cut in front of it. Sore loser? I think so. But it's not like we were racing anyway.  The good thing of that evening was coming into a four-way (stop) intersection. Everyone knew when it was their turn and when the others had priority so it all went super smooth. This is what is suppose to happen, but as of late, more and more drivers do not seem to obey such laws. I'm not &#8220;to the book,&#8221; but I know when to obey the laws and when to push it a little. This leads into the second bad thing, which was a five way (stop) intersection. This wonderful piece of accident material lies just near the recreational centre (sic) I was to meet my friends. I've seen two accidents happen there, and one came close to happening yesterday. Fortunately, it didn't and I wasn't trapped there.  Thus, I got to torture my body by being the most active I've ever been in ages. Now, I'd rather just get home and drown my pain in the satin embrace of sleep.

       I figured that it will take me about 6 months to get squared away before I can start going for an apartment. Since I'm trying to actually purchase a condo rather than renting, I hope I can find something pretty good. However, before this can become a reality, some payback needs to be done on my end so that I don't have any debt to worry about.  I really hate hindsight. Being more frugal in controlling my money and temper, I wouldn't be in the current position I'm in. But some people need to learn the hard way and as such, I am one of those people.  The weather has been skittish. As much as I enjoy the sound of rain falling on the roof, I am beginning to dislike the liquid torture as it really makes it a pain to keep my car clean.  For a car, I will never go back to the color black.

       The Maui Film Festival ( urlLink 1 ,  urlLink 2 ) sounds pretty cool. I wouldn't mind getting into an artsy fartsy mood once in a while. Also a trip to the beautiful island of Maui would also be a nice calming and refreshing excursion.  I'm not much into hiking but wouldn't mind when surrounded by lush green valleys and majestic mountains. Not as if Oahu doesn't have any of those, but only Maui has a nice &#8220;reward&#8221; for making it back safely. You guessed it, Krispy Kremes!  Perhaps next year...

       Earlier tonight I experienced my first blog flaming. I have this other site going and it's just like this one... unknown. Yet somehow, a kid looking for cheap thrills thought it best to irritate me. Now I'm not ranting, per se, more of appreciating the stupidity of other people because I've been productive due to the harsh and uncalled for comments, even if they didn't really affect me (I'm not black, gay or into pedophilia). I've gotten into tracking and hunting down the dumbnut as well as installing a program that'll deter spammers. So yeah, I actually had a nice night.  This event also brings to mind my first experiences with the  Net . Back when a few people knew about it and even fewer knew how to use it. I didn't, but I knew how to log onto BBS systems and access telnet chats. And yes, let's not forget MUDs. Back then, everyone was cool. You had a problem, you talked it over. Otherwise, it was explore explore explore... and download free pr0n. Nowadays, the Internet is highly accessible to all sorts of people and it's just not the same. Email was the best thing next to pizza and pepsi. Web browsing was fun since you could access pr0n for free (ok ok, I won't mention pr0n again). Along the way, evil bastards that dare call themselves human beings came up with the idea of spamming emails. Oh yes, then it [d]evolved to comment spamming on weblog (and other) sites.  Sometimes I wish the Internet was kept to an elite few. At least then, if someone acted up, we could take necessary steps to vaporize the freaking dumbass.

       Especially when they're shiny and take good pictures!  Got myself the Canon Powershot SD110 Digital Elph. Or as I like to say... the Elph. Compared to my old Olympus Digital Camera, the Elph is fun to use. It's compact, takes photos quicker, and picture quality is much better.  I'm more of a techno fetishist than a photography nut, so I'm not concerned much about a lot of features, but there's quite a bit in this small package. Though I won't use the feature much, the Elph can record video and audio. I just wanted something that can fit nicely in a pocket and can be whipped out quickly and take snapshots of whatever I feel like. In the future, I might get more into photography, but right now, computer stuff and car stuff are enough addictions to have!

       The past Sunday was a fun day spent out in the sun. Not thinking things would be to bad, I didn't bother to apply sunscreen. Well, vampires burn in sunlight.  So here I am... burnt. A great way to end the weekend and start the work week.  Can't wait to do this again next Sunday.

       Well, maybe that's a little dramatic. Anyway, last night was great. Went to a BBQ party at a friends' shop. Seen some usual suspects and met some new people. Had some  ono grinds  (really good food) and alcohol.  Oh yeah, alcohol. My wonderful drinking intake consisted of; three Disaronno (which I provided) shots, two Aliz&eacute; shots and three Bacardi O bottles. I felt good that night. Some others went further than that and had beer and even Goldslauger shots. Nuts I tell you. We all chatted and played cards and the night went by pretty well.  The only negative thing is I bought too much soda. Hardly anyone who showed up drank the fizzy stuff. It was mostly all alcohol. Hahaha! :) But at least the shop dudes got something to drink during working hours. :P

       I find myself thrashing. Erasing the hurt with violence. Banishing my sadness with rage. The old clocktower, made of strong oak, burns forever. A cone of amber, ejaculating murderous gray into the violated night sky. Even the stars are weeping. The town is confused. It doesn't know whether to be shocked or appalled at what I've done. Raping buildings with my bulldozer, uprooting trees with my forklift, brutalizing cars with my bat and decorating the masses with the sharpest Japanese knife I could buy on QVC.  What have I done? Nothing more than life itself. I brought color and activity in a world of routine. I stepped out of the equation and smudged a few numbers.  Why have I done this? To live. To be free of this bondage. To own self and stare defiantly at mortality and the laws of man.  Who am I? A stranger, a lover, a brother, a son, a daughter, a neice, a grandmother, a killer, an animal, a human being. A child lost in the throes of time, unheard and unseen. But you will see me, oh yes. I will be visible to you and yours and all that you know shall be razed to ashes and here I will stand, an example...  Of all your ethics, crashing silently.
