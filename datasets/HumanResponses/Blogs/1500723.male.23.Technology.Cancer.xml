       Why am I sticking to this Windoze Box??   The only reason I am not able to move out of my windoze box in office is that I am addicted to  urlLink Source Insight  . Its damn cool tool with all these  urlLink features .  But I use only these following features   * Finds References Quickly  * Keyword Searches Like an Internet Search on Your Code Base   to understand  urlLink large code bases.   The above mentioned feature which I use is already available to Linux user in the form of  urlLink lxr . But I would like this one getting integrated with  urlLink anjuta.

      Heay!!! I always wanted  a fully customizable fully integrated (integrated with every damn application my machine has) search utility.. I would love if  urlLink google  comes out with this one... I will just come out soon on what this dream application should be able to do???   How about  urlLink this  one?? Does this fit my requirements???   urlLink This one  seems to have lots of information on search tools.

      *Why is Microsoft so obsessed? Because it knows search is a key component in the future of computing. Microsoft's next-generation OS, Longhorn, is conceived as a unified interface for a PC, its local network, and the Web. For it to work, Longhorn needs a sleek search utility. If Microsoft can't buy Google, it'll resort to its time-tested strategy: copy the best technology and integrate it on the desktop.*                                           -- Courtesty ( urlLink Wired )   Hope  urlLink dashboard   on  urlLink gnome  does a better job than  urlLink M$ search  on  urlLink Longhorn .

      Heck!!! I waste lots of time in these....  "The meeting, the report, or the presentation are the typical work situation of the executive. They are his specific, everyday tools. They also make great demands on his time - even if he succeeds in analyzing his time and in controlling whatever can be controlled.  Effective executives know what they expect to get out of a meeting, a report or a presentation and what the purpose of the occassion is or should be. They ask themselves: "Why are we having this meeting? Do we want a decision, do we want to inform, or do we want to make clear to ourselves what we should be doing?" They insist that the purpose be thought through and spelled out before a meeting is called, a report asked for, or a presentation organized. They insist that the meeting serve the contribution to which they have committed themselves.      The effective man always states at the outset of a meeting the specific purpose and contribution     it is to achieve. He makes sure that the meeting addresses itself to this purpose. He does not     allow a meeting called to inform to degenerate into a 'bull session' in which everyone has bright     ideas. But a meeting called by him to stimulate thinking and ideas also does not become simply a     presentation on the part of one of the members, but is run to challenge and stimulate everybody     in the room. He always, at the end of his meetings, goes back to the opening statement and     relates the final conclusions to the original intent.  There are other rules for making a meeting productive (for instance, the obvious but disregarded rule that one can either direct a meeting and listen for the important things being said, or one can take part and talk; one cannot do both) But the cardinal rule is to focus it from the start on contribution."      (Pulheez don't sue me cut and pasting this one :-&) Courtesty :- "The Effective Executive", 1966 book by Peter Drucker

      North and South Bridge explained....  The North Bridge manages all data transfers between the CPU, main memory and the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP). Things like I/O-ports (serial, parallel), USB, keyboard controller, AC97 sound, floppy controller and IDE controllers are part of the South Bridge.   VT8363 is a North bridge.. and other chip is the south bridge.. North and south bridge communicate via PCI bus.

       I thought Indian cricket team is hyped   Atlast they proved.. Team effort is all that won the cup for India.. Every one contributed.. From Sehwag to Zaheer.... All eleven players infact more than eleven (left nehra)...    Regarding yesterday match. The sachin's catch was the turning Point I guess... What a catch man... WoW..... Even sachin was enthralled with his efforts... Inzi was in such a great form that his bat in his hand looks like a spoon giving all the balls the direction he would like....   Any way it was a good effort from the team and our maharaja ganguly was also very happy.. Hope they do win the test series ;)

       Hell of a traffic in Hosur Road today   Its time 8:50, Novell Buses haven't arrived yet.. They will be sharp at 8:30 in any of the cases.. even durin the days of traffic near silkboard for flyover construction.    There was an accident in Garvebhavipalya.. But the problem with the people is that they crowd around the vehicle and stare at that as if some show is goin on.. That is the shit attitude which most of our Indians have. Why don't they stare after taking it off from the middle of the road. If you look at the amount of productivity wastage which will get converted into money.. Its shockin..  There can be easily around 10k people (considering infosys, siemens, wipro in electronic city) waiting there to get traffic cleared. I guess every one of them would have wasted atleast 1 hour of their time due to the traffic.. So its 10,000 man hours.. Which will get converted to around 15 lakhs rupees..   Just by moving the vehicle off the road if you could save 15 lakhs.. why don't they do that?????

       Flames All over the Place!!!!     urlLink future of open source desktop development   Paolo Molaro, one of the developers in the Novell Mono team, later wrote a  urlLink follow-up   Of course miguel's blog entry is below...   urlLink discussion on Slashdot

      Cut and paste from  urlLink Miguel's blog      The fear that people have on Mono's legal issues apply equally as well to everything else.  Let me explain.  Sun owns various patents on Java, and they might just feel at some point threatened enough to use them as a weapon against open source.  In the same way people feel that Microsoft might pull that trigger.  Just to put things into a different perspective: Sun has litigated over Java in the past (against Microsoft) over a contractual dispute and has done threatening legal moves against JBoss at some point (which I do not claim to understand) over bits of J2EE.  If Java on Linux became a threat to Sun, would they use their patents?  I do not know, and I hope not.  Am only illustrating the point, just like other people have vehemently illustrated the Microsoft patent risk before.    There is nothing in Java that makes it any safer than Mono at this point.  We do not have any guarantees, any written statements, any guarantees that Java on Linux will not be sued under certain conditions.  Microsoft has granted RAND+Royalty Free licenses to any patents they might own that are required to implement the ECMA 334/335 standards.  So at least our core VM, classes and compilers are safe from any litigation from *Microsoft*.    Now, pay attention to the above, because it is important.  The fact that Microsoft has given access to any patents they might hold on .NET does not mean that a third party that has a patent that is required to implement ECMA (or Java) will grant that license.  Why does this matter?  Because we just do not know if someone has a patent on pieces that Java and .NET implement.  There might very well be one that we are not aware of.  The patent might remain sleeping for a few years before someone decides to profit from it.  And the above is important.  It is important because even with a fully re-engineered virtual machine, runtime system and the rest, we do not know if you will not be infringing on a Sun, Microsoft or third party patent.  With the current patent situation, it is probably impossible to ask small startups or individual developers to do a patent review before they make decisions on how to implement their software, only very large companies might afford it, and believe me, even with vast resources, you might be taken to court by an unknown (Eolas patent for example) or by a law firm who focuses on purchasing dormant patents and litigate them.  Nat used to say "If you write a thousand lines of code, you are violating someone's patent today".    The picture is not pretty for anyone in the software industry.    But this is similar to what happens to biology students: on their first four semesters as they learn about all the dangers, infections, vectors for infections and bacteria, they stop eating everything, they start washing their hands with special products, they double clean their utensils, they wash their fruits ten times a day.  Two years later they are eating food with their bare hands again.   So at this point, you might want to consider a career switch.  Growing corn and pigs seems to be a fairly safe industry.

       File size limits for various file systems .  These values look pretty cool...  ext2/3 : 16TB reiserFS : 1EB (exabyte) JFS : 16TB on 32 bit, 4PB (petabyte) on 64 bit XFS : 8TB  BTW  urlLink this  article even though its outdated seems to contain very useful information on various journalling file systems.  In future Novell Storage Services shall rock... in these comparisons ;)  Here is NSS information.  * 64-bit file system that allows a file size up to 8 Terabytes. * Supports up to 8 trillion files per volume (depending on file size, the limit in data capacity is 8 Terabytes). * Allows 1,000,000 open files per server.

      Here is the design0.1 for the online backup that I am going to present to monty and brian during the UC2004.   ================================ MyISAM  1. Data files.(MYD)  Method 1-> Separate file or Separate table that contains the updates done during the backup mode. Method 2-> Each table.MYD will contain some area that contains the updates done in that table. Method 3-> Each Row can have some thing like backup ptr (rollback pointer)...   2. Index files.(MYI)  Method 1->Have separete index file during the backup mode. Method 2-> When ever a index is deleted.. We will not remove from MYI file we will just update FRM file. So When a new index is added information is only added to the MYI file so only the information added will be inconsistent. which will made to ignore after the recovery. But information added becomes consistent it will not be a snapshot backup. When ever a index is modified.. I guess it will be considered as a delete and a add.. If not we should consider it as a delete and add during the backup mode.  3. Schema files.(FRM) Method 1 -> Have a separate file during the backup mode.   InnoDB  Method 1-> Have a separete log file or table space or buffer in the existing table space that contains all the updates done during hte backup mode.While coming back to the normal mode. after backup all the update logs or buffer blocks of upodate information can be applied over the innodb data table space to get the information.  Method 2-> We continue to write the data to the table space. Implement the mechanism that is done by the innodb hotbackup tool during the recovery. It might not be a snapshot backup I guess.  Method 3-> Similar to the multiversioning that is implemented in InnoDB to get the consistent reads.We implement multiversioning to get consistent backup. We will have an extra column in each table called backup pointer that points to Null in normal mode. When backup mode is being set all the backup pointers will be modified to point to the consistent row data at the time of snapshot.  =============================================  BTW  urlLink Data mining  looks cool..  And this guy looks cool in those areas....

      Aaah Cool!!!!  "Brady explained to me WinFS, and his own project: iFolder 3.0. The features in WinFS will be available in Novell's own iFolder 3.0 by mid-next year. Both the workgroup client and the server will be open source offerings, and we plan on adding the same kind of GUI functionality that people saw at the PDC (the UI elements are being developed with .NET: Windows.Forms on Windows, and Gtk# on Unix).

         like olpi     Gopi/Olpi is my class mate in college days, understands the concepts very fast as most of us in the class do, But the uniqueness in him is he understands in a way which no one had any clue of it, I do had problems some times in deciphering his reasoning, And people used to get confused with whatever the conceptual idea they had after hearing his reasoning :))...  Today In training Saw a person very similar to Olpi.. Who confuses every one with all the concepts he/she has learnt.. But the problem is she is always wrong wheras Olpi was always correct :((...  Best Way to deal with he/she .. *I think I am wrong.. May be I have to work to get some idea...* Thanks eos..   Olpi: I'm sorry.. But I guess I am correct :D...

Some things make sense... from  urlLink this  Miguel's blog  there was a flame post in slashdot..   *How do we copy Microsoft and get our "working something" out the door first? Do we go back in time? *  Ulu's Answer: First we should chase and equal them or be slightly lesser and get the people who are not willing to pay huge sums of money for upgrades and then.. If we can get some share then we shall decide the technology that is going to rock... If we don't have market share we can never be deciders and always be followers :(..

      Was n training today, was surprised to hear that the process would be in waiting state immediately after it calls the interrupt for the specific system call...  And when interrupts that occur when the state is in kernel space, Linux takes care that kernel space stuff continues to run from where it left off when the ISR returns..   I have downloaded intel x86 spec long ago.. But couldn't spend much time on it.. Learnt that there are 4 security levels in Intel and Linux uses only two of them and OS/2 uses all four of them.. and the instruction you can execute depends on the security level u are running...  ISR's doesn't have any process context and it should assume any stuff and read user address space.. I still donno what this stuff means as System calls are implemented as ISR's I suppose...  kernel getting tainted.. is there any way related to GPLisation of kernel modules.. let us see

       From the 17th floor of the Peabody hotel..   These guyz are charging like 125$ per day. . Hotel is cool.. But it doesn't serve my purpose.. Wireless signal is pathetic here.. I am losing my connections too some times...  So what's the use of paying all these stuff... if you don't get wat you want.. In Hampton Inn Provo I got 2MBPS effective download speed... So bottleneck ways always the web servers not my connection :)..

       My Wallet's ashes are also burning.   Continuing My shopping spree today I bought a home theatre system worth 120 bucks..   Went to shopping for buying a gift for my sister. I initialy thought of buying some cool dolls for her. After going there.. I started looking at Hand bags for my sister. I don't like the items like that and also got confused with a wrist watch. But I remeber gifting her a wrist watch a year ago and then I went to portable MP3 player area.. Just adjuscent to that there were sony sport boom box stuff which attracted But it didn't have facilities for DVD or MP3 or else I would have bought that for sure and then I moved one more rack left to go for DVD Mp3 players.. Almost purchased a sony MP3 DVD Player On my way to the billing counter.. Sales person just showed us the home theatre and now its in my room :).. I was neaway thinkin of buying a home theatre So it was a good deal any way Home theatre for 120 bucks...

       Cultural difference I noticed....   Lots of importance to the physically disabled people..  Importance to pedesterians. people are very courterous and kind. People here enjoy their life from sex to Nirvana.. Here every thing is celebration as kripa says.... People are committed and enjoy in whatever they do and do whatever they enjoy..

       ISKON in Utah   Yesterday went to  urlLink Iskon in Utah. . Iskon in Utah.. Looks ironical.. I guess Utah is the state which contains the least number of Indians.. And this temple is built and maintained by an American who converted to Hindu changed his name (carudas Pronuncuation is : Karudas) and his wife (vaibhavi devi) is also Hindu converted American .. These people look interesting.. And temple is beautiful located in the remote village (spanish fork) of Utah and has a cool sceneries around it... and he also has some llama's...

      Cut and Paste from  urlLink here   I remember blogging related to some of the ideas mentioned below.. some time back...    Project Utopia   Robert Love and Joe Shaw's umbrella project to improve hardware interaction in Linux desktops is pretty promising. Project Utopia spans a number of components, including the kernel, udev, hotplug, d-bus, HAL, and the graphical/user interaction components in the desktop. The goals of Project Utopia go way beyond what people are doing with hotplug today; the basic premise is to tie the whole interaction together, from the silicon to the screen.   Robert and Joe are building Project Utopia with use cases as opposed to a functional spec. This is an interesting way of designing software that is a lot more natural and gives you a lot more freedom than drawing a rigid functional specification. So Project Utopia's spec consists of statements like:   When the user plugs in a printer, autoconfigure it and ask him if he wants to make it his default printer. When an ethernet cable is plugged in, try to obtain an IP address on the ethernet interface automatically, and make it the default route.   Then it's up to the hackers to make sure that whatever they build, the user's experience matches the target use cases. This is especially good in a situation where the architecture is complex enough that it's easy to lose sight of what the user wants. I hope Robert and Joe will post their full set of use cases on a Project Utopia web page of some sort.      Desktop Search  If you've ever used a PalmPilot — even one running a very early version of PalmOS — you will remember that it had a pretty nice search function that aggregated search results from your addressbook, calendar, mail, notes, files and applications.   So you'd search for "Miguel de Icaza" and find Miguel's addressbook card, the last couple of mails he sent you, and your appointment with him tomorrow. These are all displayed in a single view, and you only have to perform the search one time to query all of your interesting data.   This feature is simple and undeniably useful, and yet we still don't have it on the Linux desktop. Unbelievably, Windows does not yet have a unified search mechanism either. People who have used Sherlock on a Macintosh miss that tool when they move to Windows or Linux. Both GNOME and KDE have simple 'find files' search dialogs, but we don't yet have an integrated search tool. A quick tool could be easily assembled using the Evolution Data Server as a backend for PIM information, and using the locate backend for your files.   A great way to build this would be to build off the backends and renderers in the dashboard. You might be able to reuse some of the dashboard backends to build such a tool, and then you'd be able to aggregate results from places like Google and Amazon in a single view. All you'd need to do is to build a slightly different UI; the facilities are even already in the dashboard engine for doing generic keyword-based searches. One thing to consider is whether or not you'd want to disable cluechaining.  But this tool is not the same as the dashboard, whose job is to automatically show you things that are relevant to what you're doing. Dashboard requires instrumenting all your existing applications to provide information about what the user is doing; a simple desktop search tool does not.  I think this application would be a great candidate for someone who wanted to try building something in Mono for the first time. Absent an indexer, you could just search file names and wait for someone else to plug in the indexing service and an indexer backend.  Speaking of which...   Desktop Indexer   We desperately need a standard indexing service on the desktop that allows you to search the contents of your files. A good indexing service could also be used by applications to index non-file objects, like IM logs and web pages that you bookmark or visit. Then, the user would be able to search his entire personal information space with a single tool.  Most existing open source indexer projects — like Lucene and htdig and all the others — are designed to index HTML and text files on web servers so that webmasters can put a Search form on their sites. The desktop indexing services that exist — Medusa, the Dashboard indexer, libremem, and others — are all incomplete, hard to extend, or both.  The indexer is one of those projects that could easily become a great example of open source at its best, because of the parallelizability of filter, stemmer and backend development. If I were to build an indexer right now here's what I would do:   Split out the dashboard indexer into its own project   Take the raw indexing and file format code from a project like nLucene and plug that into the dashboard. This gives you a really great raw indexing engine, incremental reindexing, and an efficient data store.  Build a daemon around the indexer that regularly scans your home directory and installed applications, and updates its indexes  Add some sort of IPC interface to the indexer so that applications can ask it to index their objects, even if they're not indexable files on the filesystem. This would be for things like mails, web pages you visit, etc.  Bonus work:  Redo the indexer's metadata system to allow storing arbitrary metadata about indexed objects. Make it so that it can pull metadata from ext3 extended attributes.  Hook this all up to iFolder so that any objects that get dumped into an iFolder trigger the indexe.  Check out SAMBA and make it so that it maps ext3 extended attributes to SMB file properties, so that these things get transferred to Windows systems.   Social Networking   The other day Miguel and I and Erik Dasque had dinner with Tim O'Reilly. Tim was talking about friendster and orkut, and social networking. He riffed at length about the idea of mining your mailbox, addressbook and buddy list to create real social network models, instead of these other, separate networks that we have to create manually.  This makes a lot of sense to me. If AOL wanted, they could trivially turn buddy lists into an instant social network. It could also be done in your email: Microsoft Research's Social Computing Group has an interesting project that scans your mailbox and produces a flash visualization of the people you email with.  I thought maybe Yahoo or Hotmail or GMail could do this too. And of course, we could put social networking into our own groupware tools.    Document Comparison   Not many people know this, but OpenOffice today can compare one document to another. Sort of like wdiff for the modern era. Go to Edit -> Compare Document....    Sidebar   The Scoop mockups caused a minor stir a couple months ago. I think the right way to implement this is to add a new sidebar mode to the panel. That way you can reuse all the existing applet embedding interfaces    iFolder   iFolder's synchronization functionality makes for some interesting ideas:  A blogging tool that publishes to the web by triggering a sync.   An iFolder backend for F-Spot could share and publish image galleries. For inspiration, see ShareALot.   If Evolution could store mail, addressbooks and calendars in iFolders, then you could share these things with other people peer-to-peer.    Graphical Browser History   Peter Teichman recently showed me Trailblazer. I think this is brilliant, and would love to see it show up in Firefox.

      Groupwise Vs Exchange.  Every one says Novell Groupwise server provides more functionality compared to Exchange. I do acknowledge the fact from my experience with my friends in  urlLink this  and  urlLink this  who use Exchange and I say they are paralysed. But when you look at the market share.. Its way too different...  One more evidence of how good technology might not be always popular....

       Luck    I never liked this word luck.. I am a firm believer that all the successes you get is purely because of your hardwork.. Ok I accept that there is some randomness that is provided by this nature. But its just a factor that should be neglected and not reinforced before or after your activities..   Luck and Fate is part of the nature.. As is drought and flood..   Whenever people say it as a luck.. I go out of loop and start seriously thinking for some time whether they mean it correctly or not..

       MySQL Backup File System (MBFS)   This is what I am upto for the next couple of months....   /************************************************* Todo  *  OOPS!!! My design and code doesn't take care creation of the files through the open call.... *  Remove the race conditions by having a sync primitive that allows multiple readers (multiple posix API can be executing in parallel) and only one writer( only one setting or resetting). *  Currently we are planning to maintain the information for all the open files in the memory .. This certainly shall cause a bottle neck and some criticism We have to think a complex mechanism. How to store information of open files in files... Use a sparse tables concept.... Map the exact memory into the file... *  use pathconf to get the maximum path name and use that. * . Race conditions while doing the same/different operations from different threads on the same file. How to tackle this. * Dynamic hash size.. Currently we will be having only static hash size. * open file descriptors uses static array now.. Either it has to be made dynamic array or linked list. * Check whether the requrement of copying the backup.inf after the backup mode reset is valid. * Merge the two meta data structures. * Benchmark the file system calls and optimize the code. * Change the frequently used or smaller functions into macros * have a configuration option of number of file descriptors I can use. Use them for meta data file space. * Check for the global variables usage. * Check whether is there any chance of stack overflow... Stack limit is 4 kB. * Intl enabling. * Better way of reusing the opened Meta data file descriptors across the calls. * Benchmark metadata_file update info. * Deletion and creation of the files during the backup mode... and deletion and creation of the directories... ============================================= Todo's before sending the patch. 1. Thread safe, thread enabling and removing all the race conditions and thread related problems.. 2. Hashing. 3. File Descriptor to FileName Mapping. 4. Restorartion and backup.inf implementation. 5. Meta data optimization. 6. Deletion and creation of files during the backup mode. 7.. Good debugging integration. 8. Instad of stati carray for backup_open_fd a dynamic linked list to support the platforms that allow large Fd's 9. Currently mbfs dooesn't support multiple threads calling the different/same posix functions acting on the same files across the multiple threads - Very bad requirement have to support this. Design Todo's : Design problems not solved Yet. 1. Open file descriptors problem currently i open and close for every metadata file read and write : Its not a big problem since we are having most of the metadatafile information in the memory. 2. Memory requirements : a. for filenames. 	b. In memory meta. 	c. file descriptor info. 	d. for the systems that allow large number of open files.. We might be using up the memory without any checkpoint.. We are to seriously consider this issue. Todo's of low priority. 1. Organized automated test cases for mbfs...  2. What is the best way to find whether the file is present. 2. Merging with MySQL source code. 3. Testing MySQL with Backup feature. 4. Creation and Deletion of Directories. 5. Benchmarking and Performance improvement. 6. Design Sync. Tip on Multithreaded testing.. Test the various combination of API's on the same/different files across the multiple threads. ****************************************************/

       Patents - Sux!!!!   most patents today should be invalid, as they were filed over trivial technical solutions, but the US patent office seems to be doing a poor job seperating the valid ones from the trivial ones.    Most of the new technologies in Longhorn have existed in the past in one way or another, but they failed to get shipped with a vehicle as Microsoft Windows to users, so they live only on CVS repositories, old research papers, and old systems - This is absolutely true...

       Why Gmail Rawks???   Abstract from  urlLink this  article.  The ads in Gmail are some of the most unobtrusive we've ever seen. They do not flash, spin, rotate or otherwise get in people's faces. They are quiet text ads that appear to the right of some of your messagesThey are not offensive or obnoxious and they certainly do not qualify as "massive billboards."    Note also that Gmail does not place a cheesy blurb at the bottom of the e-mail messages you send from your account either, like Yahoo does   If you send a lot of file attachments, you'll dig Gmail. We attached a whole bunch of files to a mail message and we could do it much faster than we could with Yahoo (which limits you to three per message   Most mail clients have some form of a thread view available but they're quite primitive compared to Gmail's elegant "conversations

       Vienna waits for you  By Billy Joel..  Slow down you crazy child You're so ambitious for a juvenile But then if you're so smart tell me why You are still so afraid? Where's the fire, what's the hurry about? You better cool it off before you burn it out You got so much to do and only So many hours in a day  But you know that when the truth is told That you can get what you want Or you can just get old You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through When will you realize...Vienna waits for you  Slow down you're doing fine You can't be everything you want to be Before your time Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight Too bad but it's the life you lead You're so ahead of yourself That you forgot what you need Though you can see when you're wrong You know you can't always see when you're right  You got your passion you got your pride But don't you know only fools are satisfied? Dream on but don't imagine they'll all come true When will you realize Vienna waits for you  Slow down you crazy child Take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while It's alright you can afford to lose a day or two When will you realize... Vienna waits for you.  But you know that when the truth is told That you can get what you want Or you can just get old You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through Why don't you realize...Vienna waits for you When will you realize...Vienna waits for you

      How hot air balloon rises in the air?  a. Any gas that is lighter than air will rise because of buoyancy (Archimedes principle explained later).   b. Any substance (solid or liquid or gas ) expands on heating.   c. When any thing expands it becomes less dense compared to the original substance and has so when air is heated it expands and it becomes lighter compared to air outside and tries to rise.  d. Air pressure exerted depends on the number of air molecules present or otherwise density of the air. So the Air pressure inside the hot air balloon should be less and it should collapse because of the Air pressure (14.7 pci) exerted from outside.  e. But Air pressure also depends (directly proportional to) on how fast the air molecules move so when the air is heated the Airpressure inside the hot air ballon is raised to such an extent that it equals the air pressure exerted from outside and hence air balloon doesn't collapse.    Archimedes principle - Principle of buoyancy  Buoyancy is the loss in weight an object seems to undergo when placed in a liquid, as compared to its weight in air.  Weight :- weight is nothing but a force towards towards the earth.. which depends on lots of things the density of the medium in which the substance, buoyancy of the medium and the density of the substance tooo.   Wow!!! What an example to explain a boomerang???  you've experienced this effect. You shift your weight on the bicycle so that the top of the wheel moves to the side, but every bicycle rider knows that the bike doesn't tip over as it would if it were standing still, but turns to the right or left instead.   The wing lift that boomerang gets because of the design of its wings acts similar to the weight that we apply on the bicycle and causes it to turn...

       urlLink  Groupware and simple mail server    Had a small conv with one of my friend regarding what exactly the Exchange and other groupware servers mean.. They are not simple SMTP servers. But do we use more than SMTP or Pop features from them..  The expansion of simple messaging has headed in many other directions. Most notably, Microsoft, IBM and Novell have each built comprehensive 'groupware' – online collaboration systems – that use messaging as the basis for robust environments designed to facilitate communication between employees.  Instead of simply passing messages, groupware systems allow for the creation of customised data views and interactive database applications that combine input from many people. Because they're designed for many users, such systems make the digitisation of many business processes – for example, the processing of an annual leave form – relatively simple because it can be automatically passed between necessary signatories along a predefined route.  This makes groupware a sort of publish and subscribe model, where users subscribe to specific information streams and are given access to that information as it's published by other interested parties. Since everybody in a groupware system is accessing the same central information, they can work in groups around that information.  That's the biggest difference between groupware and standard messaging, a point-to-point model where the work is the information. But it's a powerful differentiator that makes groupware a real consideration if the employees in your company frequently work on projects in teams. Major groupware systems now also support instant messaging, allowing group members to seamlessly find each other and communicate no matter where they happen to be.  Messages are digitally signed to identify their sender's identity – meaning that all messages sent within the system can, with a high degree of certainty, be accepted to have come from the person from whom they're said to have come. If this type of authentication is important to your business, you'll definitely want to step up from messaging to one of the more sophisticated groupware packages

       More Mischiefs   Continuing the previous post.. I just remembered the mischiefs that I used to do..  1. Sending proxy mails using the hole in the SMTP and I wrote an SMTP client to simplify this process instead of telnetting to the SMTP server, But the main problem I faced here was the Unix machines were not connected to the internet So we couldnot send proxy mails to their most commonly used mail accounts (Vayu server) but only to their unix acccounts which ppl checked rarely..  2. cat *big source file* > *others unix terminals* : There was a security hole in our Linux servers all the users were given permissions to access all the terminals.. and I used to dump some arbit shit to others terminals.. It was fun when some one sitting next to me was having no idea of what's happening in his terminal... He was thinking he was getting hacked.. :))....  3. net send * "some arbit"  4. Transfer of files during the lab exams was much more thrilling... I Used my HTTP server for this...  5. I also remember ppl used to play with a chat client. I guess its called pop.. I am sorry If iam wrong I don't exactly remember the name...

       Unix-Filedescriptor to FileName Mapping.   from the file descriptor, there is no way to get the filename ... No standard way that is... For linux, /proc/ /fd has fd-filename pair (do an ls -l /proc/pid/fd) Alternatively, you will have to search through all inodes, which is a lot of work   It can be done on a Linux system, using fstat()  This function returns a complete description of the file, albeit without the file's name. If you know how to work the Linux filesystem, and you have sufficient rights to descend the whole tree and to read the on-disk filingsystem, then you can locate the inode and find its name. There used to be (Unix V6 and V7) calls like ncheck and dcheck, to check a filesystem. I don't know if there is a standard tool to find a name for an inode. Must be. If all else fails, try "ls -i" on Linux, it will give you the inode numbers of every file. If you know that the file is created in the /tmp-directory, you can also perform a low-level search in that directory to find the inode you're looking for.   But beware, in a Linux system there can be more filenames that have the same inode! These are called links. See "man ln" for more info. When the last link to an inode is deleted, the file itself is deleted. Opening a file increases the number of links to a file with 1, so you can create a new file and immediately remove it. As long as the file is open, the content won't be destroyed. That's why you don't see the temp-dir's on Linux stuffed with old temp-files, like on Windows.  Inference :- Don't try to get the mapping from file descriptor to filenames.. Do it on your own...

This happened in Tamil Nadu, in a small village. The seaport town Porto Novo lies there now.       His parents gave him the name "Nagaraj", or "King of serpents" to honour the great primordial life force ...       After being kidnapped at the age of five by a Pathan and taken north to Dacca, he was later released. He wandered with religious mendicants till the age of eleven - he migrated to Benares where he rose to be a Sanskrit scholar. [See note below]       Discontent with his early success, he sailed by boat to the shrine of Katarigama on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. For eighteen months he plunged into such contemplation (meditation) where he could analyse different philosophical systems with the bright mind of a twelve years old youth or so. ......

Babaji's disciples think of him as the incarnation of Lord Shiva, and so believe that he is present everywhere. Babaji once told his disciples of the Creator: ''He is deathless. He can do whatever He wills. The whole universe is an expanded bubble ready to burst before Him.''   A Mahayogi himself, Babaji is said to have spent centuries as a recluse in the Himalayas , performing intense penance and meditation to attain enlightenment.   Many of his disciples believe that the Mahavatar moves around in the interior recesses of the Himalayas accompanied by a group of highly evolved American, European and Indian disciples......

       Combodian history   Cambodian kings were Indians  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>    |AD100 - AD600 THE KINGDOM OF FUNAN    |[Map]c. AD100 The Kingdom of Funan, part of the lands which will become the vast Khmer Empire or Cambodia, is established by the legendary Indian brahmin, Kambu. The peaceful settlement of Indian traders begins the process of Indianization of Cambodia.  |c. AD245 Two Chinese ambassadors visit Funan and produce a report on all aspects of life in the kingdom.   |AD357 King Chandan, who is probably of Indian origin, comes to the throne of Funan. He is succeeded by another brahmin ruler.  |End AD400 - AD500 The Kingdom of Funan is a prosperous trading region, lying on the trade and pilgrimage route between India and China. Indian culture still plays an important part in the developing Kingdom of Funan, although native influence over customs, art, architecture and religion is now also very strong. Both forms of Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism, a type of Buddhist religion popular in India and China, exist in Funan.  |6th century There is evidence from the texts of contemporary Chinese historians that the Funan Empire is strong and respected throughout Asia. Indian influence is still very much evident in all areas of life. Trade in Funan is centered in the prosperous port city of Oc-eo.  |AD514 - c. AD539 King Rudravarman is the last of the great kings of Funan. He cultivates the worship of the Hindu god Vishnu. Statues of the god dating from his reign still exist today, showing the influence of contemporary Indian art and religious iconography.  |c. AD550 Prince Bhavavarman of the Funan royal family (and grandson of King Rudravarman) marries the female heir to the throne of Chenla, a fertile kingdom to the north of Funan occupying the territory which today is Laos. Chenla is inhabited by the Mon-Khmer people whose leaders are related to the Funan royal family before the time of Bhavavarman.  On the Chenla king's death, Bhavavarman becomes King of Chenla, and when the Funan king dies, he siezes Funan as well. Within a few years, Funan becomes a vassal state to Chenla.     | AD600 - AD800 THE KINGDOM OF CHENLA    |c. AD600 - AD611 Bhavavarman is succeeded by Mahendravarman and then by Isanavarman, both of whom are strong kings and complete the process of integrating Funan into Chenla. The capital of Chenla is initially at Sambor, some 40 miles southeast of Angkor.  |AD616 - AD635 King Isanavarman rules the Kingdom of Chenla with his capital at Sambor Prei Kuk.  Architecture develops in the kingdom using sandstone for building and beautiful carvings in stone for the temples.   |AD635 - AD656 King Bhavavarman II rules Chenla. Mahayana Buddhism spreads in Chenla. Statues celebrating this religion are found.  |c. AD750 Jayavarman I becomes King of Chenla. His reputation is as a strong war-like king who expands the Chenla kingdom through his many conquests. Ruined temples from this time still stand in the land around the Angkor region. Wars of succession divide and weaken Kambuja. Contact with India is broken and trade ceases. As the Kingdom of Chenla declines, the Saliendra dynasty in Indonesia rises to power. It is possible that this Indonesian dynasty may have, in part, descended from the royal family of Funan.  |Late AD800 This is a period of weakness and eventual disintegration into individual states for the Kingdom of Chenla. There is an administrative breakdown which results in the separate states being powerless. Meanwhile the Saliendra dynasty, the ruling house of the Indonesian Empire, becomes increasingly powerful and starts expanding in southeast Asia. The Saliendra king of Java invades Chenla and claims the throne, possibly on the grounds that he is descended from the royal house of Funan. Cambodia becomes a vassal state of Java.         |AD800 - 1440 THE KINGDOM OF KAMBUJA    |c. AD800 - AD850 Jayavarman II, a young man connected to the Chenla royal family and educated at the Saliendra court in Java, returns to Chenla in AD790. He becomes king around AD800. Initially he extends his kingdom by seizing land to the north and east of Chenla. His 50-year reign is decisive in developing the Khmer Kingdom by establishing its constitution, religion and capital. His reign also sees important changes in Khmer architecture. He builds several capitals, but finally establishes his principal capital at Roluos, about 10 miles southeast of today's town of Siem Reap. He names this city Hariharalaya.  |AD850 - c. AD877 Jayavarman III, son of Jayavarman II, succeeds the throne of Kambuja and continues to rule the empire from the city at Roluos.  |c. AD877 - c. AD889 Indravarman I, a nephew of Jayavarman II, rules Kambuja. He is learned and brings peace and unity to the Khmer Kingdom. He has a wide reputation for being a strong king throughout southeast Asia. His peaceful reign and the income from the expanding Khmer Empire enables King Indravarman I to embark on an ambitious building program.  |AD877 Indravarman builds a large reservoir north of the city.   |c. AD889 - c. AD900 Yasovarman I (son of Indravarman) is King of Kambuja. He supposedly descends from the Funan royal family through his mother. Many inscriptions found on temple walls describing the events of his rule date from his reign. It is believed that he was a strong but tyrannical ruler. He moves the city from Roluos to the present site of Angkor, a few miles from today's town of Siem Reap. Here he [Map] builds the city of Yasodharapura with the Bakheng as the central temple. At Roluos he builds the Lolei Temple in the center of the baray.  |AD900 - AD921 Harshavarman I, Yasovarman's brother, rules. He builds his temple-mountain, the Baksei Chamkrong, a stone pyramid with a single tower.  |AD921 Harshavarman's uncle, Jayavarman IV, divides the kingdom and sets up a rival capital about 60 miles to the north east of Angkor in the old Chen La Kingdom at Koh Ker. His son rules in this new capital. Prasat Kravan is built to honor Lakshmi, the wife of Vishnu. It is a brick temple with a rich beautiful shrine. This is one of the first temples not to be dedicated by a king, but rather by an individual or member of the hereditary aristocracy.   |c. AD930 - c. AD944 An usurper successor (whose name is unknown) rules, followed by his son. The capital remains far away from the Angkor site.  |AD944 - AD968 Rajendravarman II, a descendant of Yasovarman I, rules Kambuja and brings the court back to the old capital, Yasodharapura, at Angkor. He continues to expand the Khmer Empire further and manages an impressive building program during his relatively short reign. The Sanskrit inscriptions on the temples remaining from this reign tell us that this king was wise and tolerant. Several Mahayana Buddhist establishments are set up at Angkor during his reign.   |c. AD950 Rajendravarman II attacks the Cham Kingdom which lies to the east of Kambuja.   |AD968 - 1001 Jayavarman V rules Kambuja. His reign is marked by peace, prosperity and cultural development. Jayavarman V's court is filled with scholars, poets, ministers, ecclesiastics and philosophers who discuss the mysteries of the world, paint its beauties, write music and songs, dance for the delight of the king and his courtiers and build wonderful temples, among them the exquisite temple of Banteai Srei. Jayavarman V also builds the temple of Ta Keo which is dedicated to Siva and is the first of the Angkor temples to be built completely of sandstone.

       Ultimate test for your code : Making it yes certified on NetWare.     I think the ultimate test for any code is nothing but making ur code run on NetWare. The code which was running peacefully and passing most of my test cases on Linux, doesn't even compile on NetWare not because of platform changes because of some obvious crappy coding typos and standard 'C' compiler bugs. After seeing those errors I was in total surprise how that code compiled for Linux.    After i get it compiled then NetWare starts singing and dancing with its traditional abends, After fixing some of the abends our NetWare spits out all sorts of errors on its console saying your program leaks the blood of the computer..

       Chennai Water crisis   Chennai 55 Lakh people need around 103 Million litres (minimum) of water every day.   Telugu Ganga project :  The Krishna river water released from the Kandaleru reservoir in Andhra Pradesh reached the zero point near Uthukottai in Tamil Nadu, after covering a distance of 152 km, on February 16. It was to reach Poondi and then course 35 km down the Baby Canal to the Red Hills reservoir for being treated and ferried in tankers. But such hopes evaporated on February 18 with the Poondi canal remaining dry. Illegal tapping of water by farmers and the drawal of water to meet the demands of Tirupati town in Andhra Pradesh were offered as the reasons for the virtual non-arrival of the Krishna water in the Poondi canal.    New Veeranam Project  : The scheme was being implemented without affecting irrigation in the existing ayacut. By raising the lake bund by 0.6 metres, its capacity had been raised from 930 mc ft to 1,485 mc ft, she said. This and other steps taken to augment the lake's capacity would result in the availability of water going up from 11.06 tmc ft to 14.45 tmc ft, she said. Of the additional 3.39 tmc ft, only 2.45 tmc ft would be used for the New Veeranam Project.     Desalination plants  : Nuclear plant at kalpakkam already  urlLink has one  with a capacity of 6 million litres. Whereas one that is  urlLink planned for chennai  by Mr. P. Chidambaram is for 300 million litres capacity.  My biggest worry is these desalination plants needs fuel for its operation.

       (Why/Why not) higher studies?   Hmm, Most of my frens say that I am suitable for research and I should have gone for research and Ph.D and even my Aim too was was to go for Ph.D during my college days But two years have passed after my collge life and I didn't take any solid step towards it, and Now I need to answer question for myself on why I didn't go for Research?  The Actual reasons why I didn't go for research  a. Some continous source of Income for my Parents I couldn't guarantee this.. b. I found industry interesting... c. July 14th Issue.. d. I didn't want to go far away from my family and frens for 5 years (Assumption Ph.D takes 5 years) e. Any way I would be coming back to India after Research I didn't find much of a value add of Ph.D except for it would full fill my dumb dream and apart from that it might give some exposure. f. My entrepreneurship ideas.  But Now I want to give strong reasons.  a. I now feel that It's good that I didn't go for research because till now I haven't decided on the subject of Interest, Networks interest which I had was an arbitrary one and doesnot have much of reasoning. And even if I would have gone for Research I would have ended up doing some arbit subject which I wouldn't have been able to reason.  b. Research are mostly theoretical, only very few research concepts come out to Industry and Among the few of the concepts that come to the Industry only few of them are useful to the common man. At any point of time My Aim was to do some thing that will help common man and If I would have gone for research I wouldn't have made sure that my research would have helped common man because i would have been doing something which My professor likes so that he would give some good grades.. But Now I will certainly want to work on the things that are needed by people in the technology I am working and I will certainly go for research if its needed. Now I don't worry about professors and grades because I now know what matters...  c. There is no end for research in my life I was always doing that and I will continue to do that But it has taken a different shape.    Why Not CAT?  Till I finished my college I considered my self as a tech guy and I also had opinion that tech guyzz shouldn't go for Management and hence I never considered CAT or Management courses for higher studies.  But after I came out of college, I realised that I am very poor in economics, finance and also Management (all the non tech aspects) I certainly want to learn them when I need them So Now my decision about the Management is I will learn these subjects either through P.G courses or part time courses or through some other mechanisms But only when I need them.  And One of the blindest of dreams that I still want to pursue is the theoretical physics. I donno why I wanted to do work on that, But I want to do work on that at any cost at any age. I will certainly start one day to work full time on theoretical physics..

      The Euro '04 was the first soccer tournament i followed completely. And to the surprise of the world Greece became the champions. So i reflected that, if an underdog Greek could win a championship maybe it is time i give it a shot. Well, yesterday i played football again after two years. Before that i have played it thrice in my life.  There is this tiny ground in our campus we use for any prupose. Football is no exception. Four bricks (goal posts) and viola! Three minutes into the game, the ball came to me twice. I tried my best to dribble and pass it to my teammates. I can now confirm that round things are tricky to control. The captain of my team came to me and said "follow me" and started walking. I followed. After sometime he stopped and said "dont follow me". We were in inside our D. A subtle way of saying "you are not good enough to play forward... please defend". I took the hint and never crossed the D after that. Soccer is a very demanding game. Five minutes later, i was running out of air and my lungs became dry. I politely asked some players that if by any chance i would fall and die they should tell my parents that the Greeks were responsible. After the game, the captain came to me and thanked me personally for the two assists which got converted. After that my team captain came to me and told me in the very subtle way of his "will u be coming tomorrow?" (The answer he honestly expected was NO. So i gave him the pleasure. He was very happy) Read "The Inscrutable American" sometime back. There is this time Gopal comments about the way american named the game `Football` when it has nothing to do with foot and a ball whose shape is anything but a ball. How true! Americans!  Today morning i got up and felt immediately this is not my day. Reason being, my roomate was dressing and he was not expecting me to open my eyes. What a spectacle that early in the morning. The lengths(no double meaning intended) these roomates go to improve intimacy. So got ready and kicked my bike alive for the 20 minutes drive to office. No sooner than i reached the main road the heavens opened. Rain. Did i mention, it is official now: my raincoat was stolen last week. Oh God! Why me?  Do u remember  urlLink this . It was a day-time repeat of that. I reached office after 45 minutes. If Akshay Kumar had a competition in the song "Thippu thippu barsaa paani.." with Raveena, it was me. That wet. I was shivering the whole day like i was recovering from a nervous breakdown.   At 6:30, a colleague called out "Im going to play TT in the recreation room. Want to join?" I humbly replied, "Its raining." He gave me the sternest of looks and moved away.

      Two Cops(2 Flicks in French).This is one of the french movie that I saw yesterday.    Scene 1:  Detective Jaures is working on a case of bank robbery. He is at his house talking in a telephone. Hears that robbers worked with commando like precision, threw a timed explosive to chalk out an escape. Strikes a bell. He moves stealthily, takes a file from his hideout. Takes out a few old newspaper clippings that talk about a similar operation conducted earlier.His face taut with emotion. His wife enters the room. Takes the file and tries to look into it. He snatches it saying its confidential. She replies "I dont believe you."    Scene 2:  The younger cop Antoine arguing with Jaures. Antoine ends the conversation by replying " I know why you like me. Thomas would have been my age.". Again Jaures face is inundated with flood of emotions.    Scene 3:  In the end, Jaures looks at the dying terrorist and says with controlled anger... "A promise is a promise".    Scene 4:  Jaures looks at the same newspaper clippings and tears them one by one. The last paper's headline is "Young Cop Thomas dies in the blast".His wife comes takes out the paper from and tears it. Places it on her husband's shoulder and says "I'm sorry, Jaures. I doubted you."   I understood as to why Jaures still decides to be a detective eventhough he's a genuis and could have become the head. Fascinated me as to how much can be conveyed by saying so less. Sort of gave the perfect definition to the word "Subtlety".If it had been any Indian or hollywood movie, there would have been a barrage of tears and french kisses(how odd??). I've grown from an admirer of French movies to a chavunistic. They are indeed masters of aestheticness.

      First of all, sorry for not posting anything for a long time. You know, they cut off the access to blogger.com from my company(Thankfully its back). And then you know I had some relatives come over to my house. And then you know I had to organise an offsite for the team. And You know I was also going through some confusions that affected my already affected mental life. And then now you know although all these above said things are true, I'm good at giving excuses :). I've sort of now decided on the blog allocations. All my daily cribbings, cravings and other nonsenses would find its way into this blog. All the other occasional nonsensical stuff, that I also call creative writings and thoughts would go to  urlLink my home blog . And the other tamil nonsensical thoughts would go to my tamil blog  urlLink laadlabakdas . The last one actually,incidentally,accidentally got mentioned in  urlLink valaipoo . By now, you guys also must've realised that I'm good at planning. Now coming to the actual topic...I managed to get myself lost in the potholed, bumpy and curving roads of Banglaore...not once but twice. That too on consecutive days. On sunday, I dropped Mukund at his home and he started giving me directions. I told him that I had been there previosuly and I knew the route. Well, that was God's honest truth. 100..200..300 metres...got confused. Tried to find my way out but then got confused again. It took me atleast an hour to reach a place that should take 15 mins. If it happened one night, it happened again yesterday. I guess my experimental blood is showing up too much eventhough I know nobody is gonna credit my discovery as "Bala's Route". Yesterday was much worse because I was trying to find a route that was not in my part of the city. The worst thing about getting lost is you cant throw up your hands in despair and say "I give up". And whenever a junction comes up, you really get confused whether to turn, where to turn and the only thing that'll helps you to decide is the breadth of the road. Cos you think the broader the road the more chances it'll lead you to a main road. But I'll tell you that algorithm doesnt actually work. So the pursuit to be another Colombus continues...

      Finally, i could squeeze some time to write something. Had to go off work early for home hunting. We need a rental 2BHK near Kothrud area in Pune (if u know any contact: mrmathi@gmail.com). And for the past week i the cynosure of a little passing game in our project. Both Version 2.0(maintainence) and version 3.0(new release) wanted me(u see, im famous here). Reminds me of the tamil phrase "Athula oru kaal, saethula oru kaal". Both the version's GL's were giving me work merrily until i complained to the more compassionate one of the two that im always hectically loaded. It was a hard decision from the v2 guys to let me go. They warned me about the dark side of v3...and u-know-who...but i said "dark side it is, Period." Now im doing the same work under a different banner. I thought i would be free enough once i moved to v3, but nary i found time to write. So does my fellow bloggers, it seems. Whats with u guys down there? Bals, Ulu...anyone? No post for the longest time since June 16th. Im ravenous for some posts. Last saturday, we (me+niket+parag+vinayak+some imaginary girl friends) went out on a trip to a place called Bajha caves near Lonawala, an hour drive from Pune. The caves are national monuments. Figures as it belonged to the buddhist monks from 2-3rd century. The caves were totally carved out of the mountain looking over a huge valley. They were carved somewhere in the middle of the mountain so that the access to it is harder from any direction. Without the concrete stairs, which makes it a lazy walk for five minutes, the caves would have been a real tough trek to access. There were some 18 caves in all, with the biggest caves: a sort of shrine in the middle. The other caves were apparently dwelling quarters because they had a cot of stone. All these digs were approximately 6.5 x 6.5 x 6.5 with atleast one cot. The engineering and geological knowldge of those monks were unbelievable. Some caves had sculptures as well which i think were not from the same era. Must have been an addition by the Hindu rulers after the caves have been deserted by the hermits. Enough history lessons. Now to the exciting part. There are some 3-4 waterfalls in the vicinity of the caves. The number is less because it havent started to rain real hard this monsoon season. Once we saw the falls we went in for the kill. The water was cold and hard. The rocks were slippery and the thrill was great. We drenched and cleansed as if there was no project deadlines, no GLs behind ur ass. All this while a friend was clicking away the camera. (The pics have come out in real graphic details of naive males in their undies. So out of concern for the female crowd, who visits this site, the pics have not been included. The truth is i have to find a scanner.) Three hours later we had to return as there is a project deadline. Reality! It bites! From then on it was all downhill this weekend.  Disappointments of the weekend: Couldnt get tickets for `The Passion of the christ`. Although visited 3 rental homes we couldnt find any digs as yet. I blinked too long and missed Sunday go by. The MEOW class still dont have any good-looking girls.  Soon u might read in the papers, "Dejected software engineer from Pune took Bajha caves as his residence..."

      Indians have always been guilty of exhibiting a shockingly high divergence between private and social utility. Thus, they will bathe thrice a day but not pull the chain in a public toilet; they will keep their homes spick and span but throw the garbage over the fence on to the public road; they will not pay their taxes but demand all kinds of subsidies; they will bribe for everything but complain about corruption; and so on.    cut and paste from  urlLink here

      People, there are two things i consider that the Gods have always been inconsiderate towards me.  Women and Travel. The first is easier to explain... plastic surgery is still out of reach for a software engineer in India. Second, lets just say that some of the worst memories of my troubled little life are from the ones that involves commuting. Yep, i have been involved in all kinds of travel-messups one can imagine. Marooned in the motel, monsoon stops train spoils diwali, sleep in the bus-cabin with seven other strangers, ticket torn/lost/wet, drunken cargo loading guy, luggage lost.... U name it, i got it. I can officially publish "Murphy's laws: The Travelers edition".  That said, I went home to Trichy from Pune last week after a really long gap. The only thing that serves as a motivation against that morbid fear of mine is the assurance that i'll meet friends and family. The journey, with me involved was bound to be an eventful one. My Volvo booking from pune to b'lore was cancelled. I came to know this four hours before my departure time and i had to settle for an ordinary Southern-travels-airbus which leaves two hours later (9PM) than the volvo. The promised fifteen hours travel was lenghtned by no less than six hours. I set foot in b'lore on saturday around 5PM minus my spinal cord. Meet friends. The purpose of the journey and the torture was rewarded when Moosa, Bals, Jap, Manix, PK, Ulti said things like "reduce ur tummy", "u look different", "U write lovely", "do MS in US only", "what happened to u?". Everybody had a different prespective. But everyone agreed that i needed a haircut. Saw Van Helsing(sorry, no more reviews... im taking Bal's advice). Much talking and some nostalgia later it was time to leave. Manix dropped me at Madivala amidst pouring rain(a Thanks cum congrats cum visa-treat is in order). I was as wet as Sridevi in Mr.India. Boarded the bus that would take me home, trichy. Slept like the drunkurd guy lying in the alley near `Gandhi wines`. Six and a half hour later i was in Trichy. I disembarked before anyone noticed that my seat was totally ruined because of all the rain water i carried from b'lore. When i reached home i was as loose as sand and gravel mix. I hit the bag and thought what i hated most the travel or the journey.   ...to be continued  (The return journey involves a flight from Madras to Pune)

      Sorry guys for the trickling number of post. But have no fear, im not running out of ideas. In fact im fearful that i might forget to post some of the wonderful ideas i get, that i decided to prioritize them. This one came to the top of the list today. Here goes...  Preamble: 	I had this huge cruch on this girl from school days. From 7th grade to 10th. Her name is KALAIvani. (The word KALAI is capitalized because of another reason. I love that word as much i love women. It follwed me my enire life. Well my first crush's name has it. My favourite person cum teacher in the world is KALAIchelvi. My mother's name is KALAIarasi. And my college crush... her name do not have KALAI in it. But wait a minute... I felt miserable and asked the Gods why not. The answer came: She fell in love with a guy named KALAIko. Life was artful again! Now u know one of the minimum criteria i would impose for my to be wife. Okay, now to the subject..) The first cruch(fc). It will always remain in ur minds, doesnt it? Like a scar. Like a curse. Till the grave. I still remember her face and poise so well that i can close my eyes anytime and her delectable face is recalled in seconds (nothing close to Hannibal Lecter). She often comes in my dreams(not those kind of dreams) wearing the same smile and the same perfume, and i go crazy once again. If i had an guardian angel i would know how she would look like. I never told her anything abt my feelings because i was too shy and withdrawn. By God, how i regret that? Today morning, i had this dream.  The Dream: 	I was back in my school. Kalaichelvi madam was teaching Physics like she always does. My school friends were also there sitting besides me. Even my current roommate, S.P.Bala was there: we were discussing a mathematical problem. I immediately realized that im dreaming. So i turned around to the see whether she is also present. Yes, yes, she was there.. as ever, as beautiful, as sweet. My heart was filled with a sense of euphoria even though i knew she isnt real.  	The teacher interupted and announced that she had corrected the Physics exam papers and she would like someone to distribute it. Kalai popped up and collected the papers from the teacher. She started handing out the papers, and when she came to me with my paper, i thought "She is more beautiful the closer she is to me". Then the teacher turned to me and said "you got the first mark". And i think she heard it as well for she had this distinguishably pleasant smile. After she finished with the papers she turned towards me and sat next to me (wishful thinking, i suppose). I was trying hard to see my exam papers while my heart beat was skipping and i broke into a sweat because she is near. She saw my paper and said "i got that problem wrong, can u explain how u solved that?". Even i dreams this was a rare oppurtunity. I grabbed. I was very excited and i wrote all the steps even the ones which i didnt bother to do in the exam. I didnt realise how animated i was getting while explain the things to her, but the teacher did. She came close to us and said "Why dont u two keep your romances outside the classroom?". As i was able to appreciate the teacher's subtle comment, when she went back to taking the class, i turned to kalai and said "May be we should give it a try. The romance i mean." Only after the words came out of mouth i realised how it might have sounded for her. She was stoned by the teacher's comments itself it seems. Mine petrified her. I dont know what to say now. I collected myself up and waited for the class to end without another word. After the class (it was the last class) everybody started to go out and i caught her outside in the corridor. She still refused to see me in the face. As i have never suggested my feelings to her before (even in my dreams) i wanted to find out what she thought abt this(or is it what i think she would think abt this, remember this is my dream still). A drop or two tears formed in her eyes as i muttered something like "sorry...". I went weak in the knees. She looked up and started "You.....only...."  Thats when my roommate decided to increase the voulme of the TV. I woke up with a start and swore under my breath first thing in the morning(i havent done this until India lost to Australia in the world cup finals). Then after my thoughts returned, it struck me that i'll never find out what she thought abt me. It is a curse upon me. The mind can only think where the heart is willing to go. Im still not ready to hear her answer positive or negative. That is essentially the love i have for her. And one more decision was in order.   The next time i see her in person(in reality) im going to tell her everything.

      A few days back Mathi talked abt those gory days of falling for the delectable curves...Just started a small trigger...will be writing on it more...but here's a song that fits to everybody who have fell in love with a woman noticed daily standing in the busstand, the next door project girl who walks by your place, some gal whom you regularly see at the cafeteria at lunch times...for whom you are prepared to do anything (or atleast you think so..) but they dont even know you exist in the same goddamn world they are in.. I dunno how many of you have heard this song...this is by goo goo dolls..But this is one hellova song for one-sided love...Its the OST of City of Angels, starring Cage and Meg Ryan...here you go...   And I'd give up forever to touch you 'Cause I know that you feel me somehow You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be And I don't wanna go home right now  And all I could taste is this moment And all I can breath is your life And sooner or later it's over I just don't wanna miss you tonight  And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  And you can't fight the tears that ain't comming Or the moment of truth in your lies When everything feels like the movies Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive  And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am

       Be warned: Im not a natural reviewer/critic. Please excuse my un-professional naïve style below. It just some of my observation and not a review. If u havent seen the movie i wouldnt make much sense. Probably u would think im the official blurb writer for the movie. Dont stop there, watch the movie and come back here again.      `Amelie`. I had no idea about the movie except i knew it was nominated for Oscars in the best foreigh film category. As my previous experience with an oscar nominated foreign film, "No man's land": is still fresh and won my hearts many times over (btw it won the Oscars also. Our `Lagaan`, same year nomination, was a joke compared to it), i had high hopes for Amelie as well.   The first time i saw Amelie i missed more than an hour. Because of that i didnt understand most of the scenes. Amelie's father leaving for airport wasnt funny at all. The next door widow saying "...mountain climbers found proof that my husband loved me" didnt ring any bell. But the next time i saw it -from the start- for the same scenes and dialogues i went down on the grounds with laughter.  Combined with a stupendous performance from the lead actress and an orthodox cameraman the director has performed a miracle. I called the cameraman orthodox because the experience of him shows and it always follow the narration like in the old movies. Im not saying there wasnt variety, mind you, it had every shot from the book.  I have never seen so many close-ups in a single movie. Everytime a surprise is reveiled to the character or the viewer (which is a lot of time in Amelie) the camera does a close-up. The movement and the ken of the camera was a thing any cameraman would aspire for(cat disturbing the bead-blinds when Amelie is dreaming Neno coming into her house, Neno's hesitative motions: dipping his hand in the sugar.. at the cafe, Amelie melting after Neno leaves - the camera moved so well that i didnt even feel the movement). Not to mention the pan and the aperture - they were simply inspirng(Amelie throwing her pebbles collection into the pond in the evening time, the cafe scenes which are quite colorful). There are a few shots with strapped camera. And there were only two or three crane shots but still conventional(like Neno chasing someone and Amelie chasing Neno). All in all the cameraman get the oscar from me.     Coming to the story: the story is all screenplay. No shot is longer than 45 seconds. Almost 50% of the scenes has only Amelie in it. This tells a few things. That the editor had to do quite a job compiling. The dialogues had to be crisp and no monologue can be allowed. And as i said before a scene wouldnt make sense unless u get the connection from the previous scenes(the garden gnome's tour and Amelie's father leaving for the airport is wisely and sparingly kept in the screenplay). Almost all the characters (more than 20 people) in the film are devoted an almost equal time & attention in the screenplay.  The director `Jean-Pierre Jeunet` is a perfectionist. I am all praise for him. Every scene is very felt and then filmed. The artistry of him is overwhelming and it oozes in every shot. The visual representation is undenyable and has an upper hand and rather than the conversation between characters. You can understand whats happening even without the sub-titles since it is shown rather than told. The narrative way of telling a story is a risk since it needs a really resourceful script or a gripping story. Here it is the script itself that eliminted the risk totally. The narration had an extempore touch to it but it also provided mood. The entire movie reminds me of dominoes toppling show since the whole story is a huge collection of bits of trivial incidents (somehow attached to Amelie). It needs careful editing and scripting to make those bits interesting and engrossing. Full marks to the editor and the director for this.  If i had to list the top scenes i would have to write the entire screenplay, so i would refrain. But some aspects i liked, i can list..  1) Parfaite of emotions. 2) Cinemascope. Cinematography. (Every frame can pass for a greeting card) 3) Narrative style. 4) Camera tricks. (especially the black&white scenes, Amelie watching herself in the tv, the close-ups) 5) Leaves u with a sense of hope always. Never dismissive. 6) Joyfully sentimental. 7) Amelie's reactions. 8) Connectivity through scenes. 9) The album, especially the mystery man at the photo counters.  Score: 10/10

      Vienna waits for you By Billy Joel..  Slow down you crazy child You're so ambitious for a juvenile But then if you're so smart tell me why You are still so afraid? Where's the fire, what's the hurry about? You better cool it off before you burn it out You got so much to do and only So many hours in a day  But you know that when the truth is told That you can get what you want Or you can just get old You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through When will you realize...Vienna waits for you  Slow down you're doing fine You can't be everything you want to be Before your time Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight Too bad but it's the life you lead You're so ahead of yourself That you forgot what you need Though you can see when you're wrong You know you can't always see when you're right  You got your passion you got your pride But don't you know only fools are satisfied? Dream on but don't imagine they'll all come true When will you realize Vienna waits for you  Slow down you crazy child Take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while It's alright you can afford to lose a day or two When will you realize... Vienna waits for you.  But you know that when the truth is told That you can get what you want Or you can just get old You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through Why don't you realize...Vienna waits for you When will you realize...Vienna waits for you

      It was every sports afficianado's dream come true. And if you happen to fall in the category of movie buff, you would have been exhausted by the intake by the time you went to sleep this sunday. It all started with Singaravelan in Raj TV, ofcourse you have to multiplex that with the England - NewZealand cricket match. Simultaneously, after some time, you also have to include Harikrishanans from Asianet in the plan. Mohanlal and Mamooty were an ultimate combo wooing Juhi all the way down to the end of the movie. Watch out for the scene where Juhi spills the tea on Mamooty's lap. Followed by MohanLal's snicker to which Mamooty responds with an angry face. Juhi comes out and wipes out Mamooty's lap with her bare hands. Then you should watch that erotic expression(with the oohs and aahs) in Mamooty's face to piss off MohanLal. Humor can't get better than this. And when MohanLal takes the tea cup and spills it on his lap, it really does get better. Worse, the following scenes evoke more rip roaring laughter. If you dont understand Malayalam, probably this would be the scene that would stand out. But, it was a race of a different kind in Magney Cours. Alonso keeping Schumacher at bay for nearly 30 laps. Still more exciting was the tussle between the trio Button,Barichello and Trulli for the last podium position. It went all the way down the wire before Barichello pulled off a miracle on the second last turn before the finish line to leave Trulli despondent. While you would be multiplexing between these two, Federer and Roddick start to slam. Ofcourse, you cant be impartial, so you also include them in the plan. Roddick's start can't be better. Slams four aces to win the first game. Ofcourse, only after this would you get some breathers 'cause by the time Harikrishanans and the GP finishes. After seeing Federer lift the cup, you had to run all the way to channel # 44 to watch Amelie. You can watch the movie any number of times. A great proof of how artistic French can get. Watch out for the scene, where Amelie melts when Nino walks out of the cafe. Also, the dangling pointer in the brain which got initialised when Smitha wrote about me getting kidnapped and becoming a mujahideen would finally get the memory address. What a way to uncover Smitha's plagiarism!!!! By the time you watch Amelie and Nino ride in the moped, you'd have had to get mentally prepared for the last ride of the night. So, if you are an underdog supporter, you'd be thouroughly satisfied when you go to sleep, replaying Charisteas' header again and agin in you head. Ofcourse, the only thing that can spoil your sleep is the thought getting caught in the vicious circle of office and project releases and issues the next day. Otherwise, it was really a super sunday.

      Greece!! Greece!! went the world y'day. Yep, a golden page was added to the footballing gaint, Greece's history. Sorry, no more comments. Im suffering from severe digestion problem from y'day night... cant figure the reason out. Say `TROY` last week. Had to go on a weekday to get the tickets: very crowded these Multiplex gets on weekends. By the skin of the teeth managed to get the tickets and in we(me+2friends) pushed to enjoy the movie. And enjoy we did.  It is a film that provides food for every type of person there is. That is to say it has all the ingredients to it. Action(a lot of it), romance(not as much as many would have expected), comedy(royal humor is always a way in historical movies), heroism(the entire movie is based on it), unexpected twists(u would expect Menelaus to hang around till the end of war...think again), director's touch(handled the protagonist Achilles's relationship with his cousin Patroclus as platonic as possible) and many other things.. The screenplay is not straight out of Illiad. The writers had a go at it. The eight years war was shrunk to a few days and justice was done i would say, sparing the viewer's a bloodbath.  Homer in Illiad would have had more to say about the love of Paris and Helen. But apprently the director's hurry shows when in both Paris and Helen's introduction scene there were caught deep in adultery. Add a bit of humor to the scene and the viewer is engrossed. And hints of humor is placed sparingly in the movie for sake of variety, but not amateurish as to reveal this to the viewer.  Achilles (Brad Pitt) carries a impressive person in every shot. Be it when he says "..it's immortality.. take it.. its yours" or when he is duelling with Hektor in a fight to death.    Hektor, sometimes i felt that Eric Bana should have been cast as Achilles. But at the end of the movie when all is done and said, i changed my opinion. The casting was perfect. The heroism and protaganism of Achilles side-tracks the love story and other things. I havent read Illiad, but i feel if the movie could have been easily made into two parts. 1) Love: Paris and Helen 2) The war: Achilles and Hektor But i have to agree that both of them would have failed miserably at the box-office. Thats what Wolfgang Peterson and David Benioff could do to a movie. Score: 9/10 -Smitha

      Bala has long since planned to get his own DVD collection. He hears about this place where you get DVDs for 180 bucks. Thinks might be a good try to start there.  Visits the place in the pretext of seeing off his friend. Goes to the shopkeeper and asks for a DVD list. It looks like he wants to buy everything out there. But his small pockets would allow only two. So, after a lot of self debating, he goes for Amelie and Shawshank Redemption. Now he comes back home and plays Amelie. So far so good. Plays Shawshank Redemption but the player says "No Disc". Bala is angry now. He goes to the shokeeper in a maddening traffic. Breaks his rear view mirror of teh bike in the process and asks the shopkeeper for exchange. The shopkeeper plays the DVD and it works. Bala can't believe his eyes.  Comes back to his house and plays it. Surprise, it doesn't play. He becomes like a madman trying out the DVD in all the players. But no player would play it except the one kept in that small shop. Bala is reformed. He says "Yes, sir. Absolutely. I've learned my lesson. I can honestly say I'm a changed man. I'm no longer a fool in the society. That's the God's honest truth. No doubt about it."

      Honestly guys..I'd like to post more articles because this is one blog that reveals my more humane side rather than the mask of famous writer that I have to wear. I can already see some disgusted faces. OK..now the fact is I have to write two more blogs that sorts of leaves a meagre amount for this one. I had thought of writing an article about Times of India on this blog but then decided to put it as a Tamil version. Because thats the blog thats yielding me a lot of readership cos thats listed on the tamil bloggers list as newcomers. Being listed in the newcomers is like joining as a fresher. Everywhere you go you are noticed. Everybody asks about you. You are the superstar before the axe falls shortly. So I thought if I post more I run the chance of more hits and regular readers. Well, things backfire. If I had kept silent,  I think more peple would have revisited. But then fools cant keep silent. Now what am I writing?? I'm really sorry for the reader who has read till this word. I really apologise.  I can't believe you are so idle. Yeah, now for the big news. I'm going on a vacation. where else but my dream destination and dreamland!!!! Kerala.... The Plan goes like this...Tirunelveli -> Kuttralam -> Trivandrum -> Alapuzha -> Ambalapuzha -> Cochin -> Guruvayoor -> Palaghat(Hopefully from here on..) -> Coimbatore -> Bangalore. So, I'm off for one week. Hopefully planning to meet you guys back with my views on Malayala Panorama. Meet you guys again should I survive the trip.

      Im back! But a pact is in the agenda. U see, im preparing, in many's views, for one of the toughest exams in the world. MEOW(3). So expect a post per week, max. Saw `Catwoman` promos. I love Halle Barrey. But I like Michelle Pfiffer better. For quite sometime i was not able to tell the difference between Gwyneth Paltrow & her. The same happened with Deepti Bhatnagar & Sonali Bendre(I think this is common atleast). But im wiser(definitely) and older(22 years and 11 months of it) now and capable of remembering faces like the back of my palm. That reminds me, im still due one post. The return journey i did from Trichy to Pune on 18th last month. Well, as i  urlLink already told  u guys, the Gods have this thing against me. Now i try to remember what happened during the flight. I realized, I've a very bad memory. But then again, i can recognize all the five airhostess if i see them anytime, anywhere in my life. The other thing i remember was the take-off and landing. 3 to 5 Gs the plane reached during those times. About the plane itself, a Boeing 737, a congested KPN airbus with 3 seats on either side of the aisle is what it is. Nothing great. Greatness was the stewardess.  There was a rookie in the lot and my fellow hot-blooded passenger tried to flirt with her. Boy what nerve this guys have...I just asked for more water...very politely.  And to top it all, Star Movies showed `View from the top` that evening.  All in all, it was one of those rare journeys i did without any embarrasing moments.

       (True incident that happened during the riots in b'lore over cavery water. I know i promised u guys a short story with characters and all... but forgive me i can only manage a monologue here.)   I passed out of college in May, 2002. I was offered a job in a good(`paying` is silent) company through the wonderful thing called `Campus selection`. But nobody told me that they could defer my joining by eight months. They did. Believe me when i say those were the longest eight months of my life. Star Movies ad HBO gave me company through those lean times at home, Trichy. After some time i had to get off that couch, since it was developing a huge dent because of all the lying around. I went to Bangalore where most of my friends(already joined their companies) and two of my cousins lived. I fell in love with the city the moment i disembarked(they have females for bus conductors!). And the daily walk through MG and Brigade road were the best i have done. We would give each girl a score in the Aish-scale (Aish being 100). It was like trying to sort an almost ascending array that is infinitely long. I even managed to get a full-time job in Mangalore for a meager pay. And i would visit my friends in b'lore every other weekend as they were the closest.   One weekend when i was over in b'lore...the still standing Cauvery water issue rose to its zenith in years. With farmers from both states commiting suicide, the tamil film industry getting involoved, buses burnt and all the political stunts it was indeed an acme. The problem is that Karnataka would send the alloted water across the border. TN retorted or rather the stunt parties suggested that Karnataka who are marginally dependant on the electric power from the dams of TN should be given the finger. Im sure it added fuel. There was a sort of mild-curfew in tamils predominant areas of b'lore. It was nothing like in the Mani Ratham movies, where a mob would walk around with assorted varieties of spears and spades. Since nobody was allowed to come outside and even if they did there should never be more than three persons standing together for more than a minute, it was quite calm, nevertheless tense. The situation was under control simply because it never went out of control. Although Mysore and the related areas still showed hostility towards their tamil neighbours b'lore was still unmenacing. My mom got panicky and called me to ask me to rush home immediately. I assured her that there is little trouble and im not coming home and i have to go to work on monday to M'lore.   The Majestic. Sunday night. Cool air. Shoulder bag and water bottle.  I cant read kannada, but i was never not able to find a Mangalore bus from Bangalore. I inquired the condutor standing infront of such a bus whose starting and destination point's words differed only by the first letter, "when does the bus depart to m'lore?". The conductor told me it would do so in fifteen minutes. He was a 45-years-uncle-next-door sort of guy complete with a beer belly, thick glasses and gutka. I gave him Rs.500 and asked for a ticket to m'lore. ...click... The entire area went black. Power-cut. The conductor was actually entertaining a small group and the power-cut made to change their point of discussion to the cauvery issue. The conductor seemed eager to join the conversation. As he gave me the ticket and the change and went back to it. As i was mildly interested in the topic i stood there and tried to decipher the kannada. Im was not good at that. But i know profanity when i hear one. The carefully thought out blasphemy were directed at the Tamils who by their view are directly responsible for this power-cut. The conductor was the most heated one. I had a feeling that he called out to the entire Kannada community to unite against the dark force that is Tamilnadu. He even used some tamil swear-words. Being an orthodox Tamil i couldnt take it anymore.  I walked away and saw the ticket read Seat#35("Penultimate row, God! My spine!"). I went into the bus and depositted my overnight bag in the luggage slot over the seats. I came outside again to light a cigerette. In the light i checked the change the conductor gave me. There was a Rs.500/- bill in the change. He must have thought it was a 100. It would be very simple to just ignore the mistake and walk away a few hundreds richer not to mention the free bus ride. But my upbringing would never allow that. I promptly went back to the conductor to inform him of the mistake. He was still engaged in the same conversation if not with more might. I interpretted him right in the middle of "..all tamils are arrogant bast.." and told him "U gave me a 500 instead of a 100." in Tamil.

       The Impossible Dream   To dream the impossible dream,  to fight the unbeatable foe,  to bear with unbearable sorrow,  to run where the brave dare not go...   To right the unrightable wrong,  to love pure and chaste from afar,  to try when your arms are too weary  to reach the unreachable star!   This is my quest —  to follow that star  no matter how hopeless,  no matter how far —  To fight for the right  without question or pause,  to be willing to march into hell  for a heavenly cause!   And I know  if I'll only be true  to this glorious quest  that my heart  will be peaceful and calm  when I'm laid to my rest.   And the world will be better for this  that one man, scorned and covered with scars,  still strove with his last ounce of courage  To reach the unreachable stars!

      Operational Insights on Cron.  Cron is a very handy and very easy to manage utility(shall I dare call it a utility?). We can manage complex task scheduling by a single line entry in the crontab file.  But there are some nuances which we have to note. Very interesting ones. Here goes:  I created the following cron entry for one of my poller jobs.  00 0-23 * * * /RAPproj/ConsApps/smsapps/nse/poller/nseTimer.sh   To exactly understand this entry, start reading from the begining: 00 	: Minutes 0-23 	: Hours * 	: Day of Month * 	: Month of Year * 	: Day of Week  This will run my following shellscript: /RAPproj/ConsApps/smsapps/nse/poller/nseTimer.sh   whenever the minute figure becomes 00; for hours 0-23; for all days; for all years.  In effect run my shellscript at every hour.  Now take a look at my script nseTimer.sh:  rrr=`ps -aef | grep nseTimer | grep  "java" | awk '{ print " "$2" " }'` kill -9 $rrr CLASSPATH=j2ee.jar:classes12.jar:ftp.jar:.:/RAPproj/ConsApps/smsapps/nse/poller/ export CLASSPATH nohup java nseTimer &  OK to cut the crap for every line above read the description:  #Find whether already a process by name nseTimer is running. #If yes Kill it. #Do the classpath settings. #export classpath (I donno what that means but we have to do it anyways) #Start the nseTimer timer class.  Now every things fine. When I run this shell script from the directory /RAPproj/ConsApps/smsapps/nse/poller (where it actualy resides) everything works perfect.  It finds already running process nseTimer; kills it; and then restarts the same process.  But when I make that cron entry run this shell script, what happens is this: 1.It finds the already running script by the same name. 2.Kills it. 3.Then does nothing(It is supposed to restart the process).  Well guys...I must admit that I invested 2 long days here just trying to figure this out.  And the correction is this new script:  rrr=`ps -aef | grep nseTimer | grep  "java" | awk '{ print " "$2" " }'` kill -9 $rrr cd /RAPproj/ConsApps/smsapps/nse/poller CLASSPATH=j2ee.jar:classes12.jar:ftp.jar:.:/RAPproj/ConsApps/smsapps/nse/poller/ export CLASSPATH nohup java nseTimer &  Notice the third line here: cd /RAPproj/ConsApps/smsapps/nse/poller  This is the directory where my script was residing.  Now to summarise this whole story up,  I told the cron that where is my shell script (remember the cron entry?) 00 0-23 * * * /RAPproj/ConsApps/smsapps/nse/poller/nseTimer.sh   So I thought that now cron will do its job. It will run the script which will find the nseTimer class and then fire that class(which is in the same directory as the script). But then the script looks for the class file in the current directory. And the current directory here is not the one in which the script is. But it is the one in which cron resides. So it looks for nseTimer in the directory where cron is and not in /RAPproj/ConsApps/smsapps/nse/poller/  Thats why that line: cd /RAPproj/ConsApps/smsapps/nse/poller saved the day  DUH!! now you guys will say what the heck .... for this small intuitive stuff you have written this huge story !!!! But believe me guys.....come to think of it. Now that I have told you this, it sounds intuitive. But if you stand in isolation, its not that intuitive too. Well ... to be honest not for me....   :-D  May be my intuition is not that strong.   Heheheh  And for those of you who are still reading..... whats your name?? we can be good friends you know !! :-) :-)    you can go thru the grind of my hopeless blabber.  :-)  take care

       urlLink Code Kata . The blog of Dave Thomas (of Pragmatic Programmer fame) has some excellent 'practice sessions' for practising your coding. What he says makes absolute sense. Every other profession requires practise, practise and more practise. Except programming it seems.  No wonder then that the quality of most code is extremely poor. Hey are you still reading this ? Start practising.   How do you get to be a great musician? It helps to know the theory, and to understand the mechanics of your instrument. It helps to have talent. But ultimately, greatness comes practicing; applying the theory over and over again, using feedback to get better every time.  How do you get to be an All-Star sports person? Obviously fitness and talent help. But the great athletes spend hours and hours every day, practicing.  But in the software industry we take developers trained in the theory and throw them straight in to the deep-end, working on a project. In software we do our practicing on the job, and that’s why we make mistakes on the job. We need to find ways of splitting the practice from the profession. We need practice sessions.

      The Zen of Python A Conversation with Bruce Eckel Part 2 of the interview is now up, its right  urlLink here    Python would make an even better first language to teach programming. It's such a gentle learning curve. You can start with scripts, and of course some people dismiss Python as a scripting language, because you can script with it. You start teaching scripts. You can teach functions. Then later you can add classes. Then you can go onto things like metaclasses. Python has many more of these powerful constructs that you can learn when you're ready. And I think that's very impressive, because it doesn't say you should only be an object-oriented programmer.

      A very very impressive quote by Dheerubhai Ambani I see written on one of those green-blue boards(those are the colors of the Reliance Info logo) in the DAKC (Dheerubhai Ambani Knowledge City)  "We should not give less importance to the seemingly smaller tasks at hand. We should do them with equal effort and focus. Cos every time we conquer such small task, we become more refined and get mor confident about solving the bigger and more complex problems."  Look at this quote in light of this discussion I had with one of the newly recruited Deployment Engineer at Reliance Infocom.  He was not interested in doing the job at hand (application deployment) cos he said that its a trivial and small task. And he supposedly wanted to do a bigger and more complex job of J2EE related software development.  And this guy who wanted to do "bigger" jobs screwed my app (a very simple serverside web app with no J2EE components) while he was deploying it. He took 1 full day to deploy my app cos he actualy screwed up the server itself while deployment (Websphere provides a complex GUI for deployment of apps, which in itself is a menace to manage; and when the GUI did not respond for some time, he started clicking his way to glory....he was litrally clicking every thing on the screen......the server died as a result)  So I was wondering that even I ...rather every one of us at one point or the other have wanted to do 'bigger' jobs while we are still an amatuer doing the things which are small but add up to be that one big job.  Hope the above stuff made sense....  :)

      Very very interesting:  urlLink Microsoft Aims At Google , and  urlLink MSNbot  -- hmm... I've beem more or less sure of this myself. Havent studied it properly though:  urlLink Intrusion Detection Systems a Market Failure   But to be fair, there are exceptions, so we'll put up the rest of the voices:  (Grefer): Distributed IDS with all their sensors can provide a wealth of information not readily available from the intrusion prevention systems he is touting.  The audit function of an IDS should not be eliminated from an information security in depth strategy without spending considerable thought on the ramifications of such a decision.  [I agree]  (Schultz): The Gartner Group has done it again--made yet another wild prediction from its "ivy tower" in the complete absence of hands-on experience or having to live with the consequences of its  prescriptions. Part of what Gartner has said, namely that intrusion detection involves a high financial cost, is true, but writing off intrusion detection altogether, as Gartner has done, is completely irresponsible. [Just a polar point of view, lets keep it in mind]   (Ranum): In private communications with Stiennon (the Gartner analyst), he offered the shocking fact that - for all that they are hyping IPS - the team at Gartner "doesn't know anyone who is using an IPS in inline mode."  That runs utterly contrary to the perception they are trying to create that IPS is the "wave of the future"  It just shows that P.T. Barnum underestimated severely when he made his famous assessment of Gartner's customer base. "There's a Gartner Customer born every minute." [Ditto]  (Northcutt): HYPE ALERT, they aren't actually saying ditch IDS, they are really saying use a firewall with IDS capability instead, the so called intrusion protection approach.  This is an ancient discussion; is an all in one plastic stereo like the one you had in your college dorm room better than a carefully selected set of devices.  It comes down to the level of investment an organization wants to make, is the increase in quality worth the price from an organization's perspective? Since well over 50% of most organization's value is intellectual property, the answer is probably a resounding yes; it is worth having monitoring systems and people trained to analyze what they detect.  An intrusion detection system with trained analysts provides a means of seeing the attacks and adjusting your defenses. IPS does not. [I agree]  Here's what other people say about the value of IDS: Arrigo Trizulli - Phd. & IDS Designer, Geneva  The reason IDS has been ineffective is that it has been badly deployed and nobody bothered to train the analysts.  An initial, guaranteed, road to failure in any security model is to deploy monitoring systems and then never look at the screens.  Then you can complete the failure by mis-configuring the monitoring systems:  CCTV cameras pointing at the sky have rarely caught burglars coming through the front door. [Absolutely true, the best for last :)]

       This is why I hate forced exceptions    Well, what a coincidence. Just talking about forced exceptions a few hours ago, and it comes down and bites me minutes later.   Java has forced exceptions, so if a method throws an exception, it has to either be handled or rethrown. While this is generally a good idea, the extra syntax of java makes this a real pain if you decide not to handle the exception after all.  So I have this program that calls various methods many many times, and once in a while the methods throw (expected) exceptions depending upon the state of the program. When certain exceptions are caught, a stacktrace is printed out on the screen, along with a timestamp and certain state variables.  The program is then run, and all output redirected into a file. The file is then examined to see what exceptions were thrown and the state at that time.  So I had a bunch of methods like so -  public void myMethod1() { try { blahblah.method(); } catch (Exception1 e) { e.printStackTrace(); } catch (Exception2 e) { ... } ... { } catch (ExceptionN e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }  When I mean a bunch, I mean a big bunch, around 250 methods, maybe more.  And there is a calling method -  public void callingMethod() { Determine which method to call (say myMethodX) myMethodX(); }  After running this, we found too many exceptions being thrown around to read the file properly, so a change of design was in order - put the output of different exceptions in different files. Unfortunately, this meant either pass the file objects upstream so that the method could write into it when an exception occured, or to propogate the exception down to callingMethod, so we decided to go with the latter.  Now we had to remove all try-catch blocks from every myMethodX and also declare that they throw Exception1, Exception5,... whichever exceptions they throw, and then catch these in callingMethod and write it to the appropriate place.  Removing try-catch blocks is easy - a simple vim  macro will do it. But declaring what exceptions are thrown must be done manually -- which means running through every one of those 250+ methods and declaring the exceptions that might be thrown.  If this was Python, removing the try-catch would have been enough; the exceptions would automatically pass through to the calling method without the need for any more changes. This is where the verbose syntax of Java makes me go absolutely nuts. In order to effect a small design change like passing exceptions on to the calling method, I have to go and modify hundreds of lines of code.  Is this what programmer efficiency is all about ? Does this verbose syntax actually help in producing better code ? I should think not. I am irritated. The prospect of going through every method, figuring out which exceptions might be thrown and then declaring those exceptions does not excite me at all. It is pure drudgework -- just to get the bloody thing to compile.  I've learnt my lesson. Java is utterly inflexible to design changes, even minor ones. Everything must be planned down to the finest detail, or else you get screwed later. The design did not work out as well as you thought ? Tough luck, you now have a major uphill climb (in the form of manipulating syntax all over the place) for your minor design change.  This sucks.

       urlLink Paul Graham , the noted lisp hacker, recently gave the keynote address at PyCon 2003 (a Python convention). His keynote address, The Hundred Year Language, is available on his website -  urlLink The Hundred Year Language   As can be expected, he dwells mostly on lisp, but its interesting anyhow.   I think that, like species, languages will form evolutionary trees, with dead-ends branching off all over. We can see this happening already. Cobol, for all its sometime popularity, does not seem to have any intellectual descendants. It is an evolutionary dead-end-- a Neanderthal language.  I predict a similar fate for Java. People sometimes send me mail saying, "How can you say that Java won't turn out to be a successful language? It's already a successful language." And I admit that it is, if you measure success by shelf space taken up by books on it (particularly individual books on it), or by the number of undergrads who believe they have to learn it to get a job. When I say Java won't turn out to be a successful language, I mean something more specific: that Java will turn out to be an evolutionary dead-end, like Cobol.

      Aamir Khan, Salman Khan and Vivek Oberoi die together in an accident and go to heaven. When they get there, St. Peter says,  "We only have one rule here in heaven: Don't step on the ducks!"  So they enter heaven, and sure enough, there are ducks all over the place. It is almost impossible not to step on a duck, and although they try their best to avoid them, Aamir accidentally steps on one. Along comes St. Peter with the ugliest woman he has ever seen. St. Peter chains them together and says, "Your punishment for stepping on a duck is to spend eternity chained to the ugly woman!"  The next day, Vivek Uberoi steps accidentally on a duck, and along comes St. Peter, who doesn't miss a thing, and with him is another extemely ugly woman. He chains them together with the same admonishment as for the Aamir Khan.  Salman has observed all this and not wanting to be chained for all eternity to an ugly woman, is very, VERY careful where he steps. He manages to go months without stepping on any ducks, but one day St.  Peter comes up to him with the most gorgeous woman he has ever laid eyes on: a very tall, tan, curvaceous, sexy Aishwarya Rai. St. Peter chains them together without saying a word. Salman remarks, "I wonder what I did to deserve being chained to you for all of eternity?"  She says, "I don't know about you, but I stepped on a duck!"

       Convocation Address at the IIT Delhi, 2001    by    Shri. N. R.Narayana Murthy,   on  The Indian of the 21st Century    Dear graduating students, families, guests, faculty members, the Director, the Chairman and members of the Board of  Governors: my felicitations to you on this happy occasion. I am thankful to the Chairman of the Governing Council and the Director for the honour of participating in this landmark event. My young friends: today, by your hard work and smartness, you have been certified as learned by the elders of this institution. For me, there is no greater joy than being with the young and the learned. I am reminded of a Sanskrit sloka that glorifies the educated person:  Swagruhe poojyate jheshtha; swagraame poojyate prabhuhu; swadeshe poojyate raja; vidwan sarvatra poojyate  (The eldest is respected in the house; the head-villager is respected in his own village; a king is respected in his own country; a learned person is respected everywhere).       Graduation is a watershed event in one's life. On this important day, it is worthwhile to ponder over what the purpose of all these years of education has been, and how you can use your education to make a difference to society. Progress is based on dreams and requires change. Change requires learning. Education is about learning to learn. I recall the words of Eric Hoffer who said:  In a time of drastic change, it is the learners who inherit the future. The learned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists.  Indeed, we live in a world where change is everywhere and constant learning is essential.   In today's world, natural resources or military strength do not determine the pace of a nation's progress. Education does. Education is about raising the confidence of an individual to think a worthy dream and to translate that dream to reality by high performance action. It is about opening up one's mind to accept new ideas, to evaluate them and to use them for progress. In a country where 28% of the youth is illiterate, you must be grateful to your parents, your teachers and your country for providing you with this instrument.    It is appropriate that you think about a few important questions on this day. Has India made sufficient progress since independence? Can we be happy about this progress? Have we kept up with pace of progress in the rest of world? Have we achieved progress that is sustainable? Have we fulfilled the dreams of our founding fathers who wanted an India where every individual will be free and will be provided with wherewithal to rise to his / her fullest stature? Can we dream of an India where poverty, ill-health and ignorance will have vanished? To borrow the words of Rabindranath Tagore, an India  where the mind is without fear and the head is held high; where knowledge is free.     Dear students: the India where we - your fathers and mothers and I - started our careers is long gone. When India started its tryst with destiny, there was an enthusiasm for nation-building that lasted till the early 1960s. As you know, this dissipated into frustration by the 1970s. I was a die-hard socialist at that time - concerned about removing poverty. Among other things, the travails of creating and running a business put paid to all illusions I had about the merits of centralized planning. Importing a computer required the head of a corporation to make 20 to 25 trips to Delhi. A clerk in RBI would take five days to decide whether the MD of a software firm could travel abroad for a day! In those days, the successful Indian was one who had good contacts with the omnipotent Babudom.   With the 1991 reforms, we secured a measure of freedom to make economic decisions within the corporation. Now, we could get down to the serious business of creating wealth and, consequently, creating a better society. The sense of enthusiasm was a marked contrast to the earlier years. In the decade gone by, several Indian companies have competed successfully with the best in the world. Indian professionals now command the highest respect across the globe. Rajat Gupta, Vinod Khosla and other alumni from your institute have gone on to mould and create institutions to be proud of. It is against this backdrop that you graduate into a time full of opportunities.   Yet, are we there where our founding fathers wanted us to be? Over five decades of independence - what does our nation have to show for it?   We have political freedom but not economic prosperity - the vast majority still do not have freedom from hunger, disease and illiteracy. Political freedom without economic prosperity is meaningless. With an adult literacy rate of 56.5% and with 35% of the population below the poverty line, the nation's social welfare efforts are an unqualified disaster. Even in technology, where India has made rapid advances, the country's progress is lopsided and disparate. India ranks 63 on the Technology Achievement Index in the  Human Development Report 2001  compared to China's ranking of 45. This is despite Bangalore being ranked 11 among the 46 hubs of technological innovation across the world.   It is our responsibility to raise India to the ranks of the developed nations.  In a civilized society, every individual has to give back to the society, in some form or other, more than what he or she has received from it. That is how countries achieve progress. Every hardworking, sincere and honest citizen - teachers, politicians, bureaucrats, military personnel, professionals, administrative staff and janitors, just to name a few professions - has an important role in this undertaking. Nobody is too small for this task. However, the educated ones among us have benefited from the sacrifices of our less fortunate brethren and have a greater opportunity and a greater responsibility to contribute to society. If we have to eradicate poverty from this country, we need a new Indian mindset for the 21st century. Let me talk a little about the cardinal attributes of this mindset.    First, we need high aspirations. Aspirations energise us to overcome limitations posed by the context. They engender and sustain hope, the main fuel for progress. They help us achieve miracles. Mahatma Gandhi's aspiration for an independent India is the main reason why you and I can live today as free people. In sum, aspirations build civilizations. Raise your aspirations high in whatever you do.     Cynicism has no role in the task of building a nation - more so among you bright, learned youngsters. As Ralph Emerson said:  I cannot forgive a scholar his homeless despondency. Cynicism takes away energy and enthusiasm, which we require in plenty if we have to realize our dreams.    Confidence is extremely important for progress. Openness is a sign of self-confidence. Hence, the ability to accept, evaluate and adopt new ideas is what will separate the successful from the not-so-successful. We have to shun any thoughts and ideas that take us towards jingoism, chauvinism and parochialism. In these days of an interconnected global village, no nation desiring economic progress can isolate itself from the rest of the world. Several nations that did so in the fifties and sixties realized the futility of such isolation, reversed the trend successfully and benefited from the resultant openness. We, in India, in all our wisdom, carried this isolation for a couple of decades longer than these countries and suffered the inevitable consequences. It is time that we overcame the East India Company syndrome. Clearly, we have work towards adopting the best practices of nations that have achieved economic prosperity.    Thanks to colonization of over a thousand years, our society is one where people are distrusted and oppressed. A society where the interest of the government is seen as more important than the interest of the people; where the jobs of a few thousand people in public sector institutions are held more sacrosanct than the millions of consumers they are expected to serve; where an Indian multinational feels less trusted by its own government than by governments abroad; and where bureaucrats assume that they know more about running world-class technological institutions than the finest intellectuals in those organizations. Unfortunately, even after fifty years of independence, we have not overcome the legacy mindset of our erstwhile rulers who, ironically, have themselves changed rapidly in their own country. We have to understand that public sector interest is not public interest and that the interest of the government is not the same as the interest of the people. One demonstration of this understanding is the proactive removal of all monopolies for the government. Government monopolies all over the world invariably create asymmetry between the benefits to government officials and the people. It is difficult for me to understand why the government retains licensing in education while it has disbanded industrial licensing to a large extent. Over a period of ten to twenty years, the government should gradually get out of all activities other than defence, external affairs, home, macroeconomic policy-making, and regulation in all areas of commerce. Our elite continues to behave like people with brown skin and a white mask. I urge you to help in changing this mindset and in bringing about these transformations.   Another bane of this thousand-year long enslavement is apathy. The main reason why India is still very backward is our unwillingness to take proactive action even when the solution to the problem is staring us in the face for a long time. A fatalist mentality conveniently blames reality and refuses to take responsibility for solving problems. Let us remember the words of Prophet Muhammad who said:  God changeth not what is in a people until they change what is in themselves.  My own interaction with people from all walks of life confirms this thesis. We have become a nation that is good in rhetoric but poor in action. Like our national cricket team that looks good on paper but consistently fails to deliver! We have to downplay rhetoric and focus on action.   Ego, vanity and contempt for other people have clouded our minds for thousands of years and have impeded our progress. Humility is scarce in this country. Even Al Berouni, the famous Persian writer who visited India in the 11th century and met many Indian pundits, has remarked about this tendency. It is time we realize that India is at the bottom rung in economic prosperity, accept it, develop a healthy respect for people who are better than us, learn from them and work hard to improve our own economic status.     No society that has shunned merit has succeeded in solving its problems. While reservation in admission to schools and financial assistance for economically weaker sections of society is desirable for a limited period of time, there are grave doubts whether economic backwardness should be determined by castes, as is done today in India. It is ironical that people see sustenance of backwardness as an instrument for progress rather than turning to hard work, smartness and honesty. Thus, we have become, perhaps, the only nation in the world where people fight to be called backward rather than forward!  You have a responsibility to debate this issue and take appropriate action to create a climate of opinion where people aspire to economic progress the right way.    We adopted an economic model where the government took on the responsibility to create and sustain jobs without any regard for efficiency and accountability. The result is underemployment, inefficiency, insubordination, demoralisation of the merited ones and value destruction in the economy. There have been, in recent times, some discussions on dismantling this model. However, it takes vision, courage and rapid action to perform this creative destruction. You are in a powerful position to encourage leaders who have taken on this task and to lend a hand in disseminating the positives of such an initiative to the masses.   You, the cynosure of all eyes in the society, have a duty to lead by example in work ethic, honesty, following the rule of law and contract, and charity.   In my opinion, the Indian professional, unlike his / her western counterpart, is rather poor in charity. Unless you can give back to your alma mater at least a small part of your life's earnings, it is difficult to strengthen these institutions for future generations. This is a mindset issue and not an economic issue. Further, the reputation of the Indian professional is very poor in living up to contractual obligations. In fact, a large number of the professionals who received financial assistance either from the government or from educational institutions for studies abroad have gone back on their repayment commitments in a manner that neither they nor their children can ever be proud of. One hundred percent compliance with contracts is the only way to help future generations benefit from initiatives to provide financial help to worthy and needy students.    Let me finally close with yet another Sanskrit sloka that summarises all that I said today.  Ahimsaa prathamam pushpam; pushpam indriya nigraham; sarvabhootha dayaa pushpam; kshamaa pushpam visheshathaha; shanthi, dhyaana, dhaana pushpa thathaivacha; sathyam ashtavidham pushpam; vishnum praseedham kareth  (Non-violence, controlling the sensual desires, forbearance, forgiveness, peace, meditation, charity and truth are the eight kinds of flowers that pleases Lord Vishnu). Indeed, these attributes characterise the ideal Indian of the 21st century.     You are the best among the best - the chosen few. You are in a unique position to change the course of India and perhaps even the world. I have no doubt at all that you will serve as role models for the 21st century Indian and will help the larger masses realize the power of such a mindset. This is the only way we can redeem the pledge of our founding fathers. Best wishes and God bless you all.

       The man who made a mockery of the term 'disadvantage'   Dream and Dare.  Lifetime Achievement Award Acceptance speech by Dhirubhai H. Ambani Chairman, Reliance Industries Limited  'Honourable Finance Minister Yashwant Sinhaji, respected Dr. Kurien, chairman of the jury Shri Deepak Parekh, Shri Amitabh Bachchan, Shri Samir Jain and Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to thank The Economic Times for this prestigious award. These days an award for a positive achievement is 'news' by itself. Coming from a leading newspaper it is a great honour indeed. A leader focuses on the positive and encourages it. And Economic Times, we know, is the leader.I would like to thank the jury and The Economic Times for bestowing this honour upon me. This award has been earned by the entire Reliance family. It consists of thousands of employees who work with total dedication. Managers who are 'owners' of operations under their charge. Business associates who share Reliance's commitment to customers and investors. And millions of investors who have unshakable faith in 'Reliance'.  'They are the pillars of my achievements. They are my family. I am proud of this family. With great humility I accept this award on their behalf. I accept the award as the son of a village school teacher from Gujarat. For me, this award has one simple message. For those who dare to dream, there is a whole world to win. Today, I would like to share this message with all young Indians: Dream and dare. My message is very simple: Let no one demoralize you. Do not allow any one to deter you. Pursue your goal, even in the face of difficulties. Convert difficulties into opportunities. Keep your morale high, inspite of setbacks. At the end, you are bound to succeed.  'Often friends ask me, Have I achieved all that I wanted? The simple reply is : No. There are many more miles to go. What has been achieved is history. I only believe in looking at the future. I still cherish several dreams: The dream of assured water supply for all our villages. The dream of a manifold increase in our agriculture output. The dream of connecting all our villages with the rest of the world. The dream of giving world-class education. The dream of providing millions of jobs. The dream of winning a war against diseases and malnutrition. The dream of employing the latest science and technology. All for the people of India. In short, I dream of India becoming a great economic super-power. Undoubtedly this dream has yet to become a reality.  'The question is : What should we do to realise this dream? First, we must know the problems. However, it is even more important to know the solutions. Let us acquire knowledge and then apply it. Knowledge is the key to greatness. Second, we must respect creators of wealth. Unfortunately, creators of wealth are ridiculed in our country. A farmer is dismissed as an 'illiterate'. Lip service is paid to him only because he is a voter. A worker is condemned as a troublemaker. Businessmen are labelled as crooks. Those who do not produce wealth discredit those who create Wealth. This attitude kills the productive spirit. A society, which condemns creators of wealth will always remain poor and miserable. Acquisition of knowledge and creation of wealth are part of our culture: That is why we worship Saraswati as well as Lakshmi.Third, we must learn to trust. For several centuries, Indians have been brainwashed to distrust other Indians. This saps national energy. Distrust kills initiative. Distrust compels people to maneuver and manipulate. Trust and transparency stimulates entrepreneurship. If India wants to be a great nation, we must have the courage to trust. This is my sincere belief. We must learn the difference between a mistake and a crime. We must have the wisdom to correct and encourage. Fourth, we must always go for the best. Do not compromise on quality. Reject if it is not the best not only the best in India, but globally.  'Friends, These principles have guided me in my life's journey from a village school boy in Gujarat to the metropolis of Mumbai via Aden.I have trusted people and they have put their trust in me. I have encouraged youth, and they have never let me down. I have asked my people to take initiative and to take risks. It has paid me rich dividends. I insist on excellence. This helps us to be leaders. Reliance is built on some of these principles. I sincerely believe that these are the principles that can help us to build a greater India.  'Ladies and Gentlemen, these are exciting times. Times of change and transition. We cannot afford to be complacent. These are times of big challenges. These are also times of great opportunities. Let us seize them. For this, we must change and discard old attitudes. We must forge a new partnership for a great India. A strong and constructive partnership between industry, government and society. We must learn to work together and reject the negative mindset. We can then prove to the world that India can do it. That Indians are not afraid of competition. That India is a nation of achievers.  This is the legacy I would like to leave behind.  Thank you.   urlLink Dhirubhai Ambani  (December 28, 1932 - July 6, 2002)   It's been one long year...

      This makes sense:    "Seven decades ago, machine-wise managers could embrace nearly any information technology, such as the mimeograph, with the faith that it would help them collect and disseminate information--the more information the better--and thus improve their businesses. Today machine-wise executives will not only know when and how to use the new tools technology brings them but also when to switch off their computers and take their own counsel."     In my day to day work, dealing with n number of issues, I prefer using my notepad (the real one ... one with papers in it...not the windows one) to jot down things to do and other notes.......while I see many others use outlook notes and tasks utilities to do the same.....I personaly find them very counter-productive.

      Faced a peculiar problem.....here goes....  Working on a Unix System,  Doing a "ps -aef" on the prompt returns all the running processes. Something Like this:       UID   PID  PPID  C    STIME TTY      TIME CMD =====================================     root     0     0  0   Jun 18 ?        0:01 sched     root     1     0  0   Jun 18 ?        3:16 /etc/init -     root     2     0  0   Jun 18 ?        0:01 pageout     root     3     0  3   Jun 18 ?       2899:18 fsflush     root   235     1  0   Jun 18 ?        0:01 /usr/lib/sendmail -bd -q15m     root   182     1  0   Jun 18 ?        1:13 /usr/sbin/cron     root   305     1  0   Jun 18 ?        0:00 /usr/lib/saf/sac -t 300     root    48     1  0   Jun 18 ?        0:00 /usr/lib/devfsadm/devfseventd 	root  3397     1  0   Aug 08 ?       331:30 /prud/portal/weblogicnew/jdk131_06/bin/../bin/sparc/native_threads/ja     root  1553     1  0   Aug 08 ?       2177:00 /prud/portal/weblogicnew/jdk131_06/bin/../bin/sparc/native_threads/ja    iuser 29300     1  0   Aug 26 ?       269:42 /prud/portal/weblogicnew/jdk131_06/bin/../bin/sparc/native_threads/ja     Notice in the last 3 entries, the CMD ie the full command is not printed, a truncated line (till the maximum limit) is printed.     I was searching for a way which will print the full command line and not the truncated one. Tried all the operators which were suggested in the man page for ps.     Then after 4-5 hours of hunting on the net, I found this:     The conventional ps is the one which lies in /bin     There is another ps and that is in /usr/ucb/      Now the command /usr/ucb/ps -auxww returns the same stuff as above but with the complete (long listing) of the command line.     Therefore the last line in the output of /bin/ps -aef becomes the following:  	USER       PID %CPU %MEM   SZ  RSS TT       S    START  TIME COMMAND ========================================================= 	iuser    29300  0.0  0.55384020296 ?        S   Aug 26  0:35 /prud/portal/weblogicnew/jdk131_06/bin/../bin/sparc/native_threads/java ScheduleTimer  	So now I can do a grep on the string "ScheduleTimer" to find out my process which I was not able to do earlier.

      Hmm....  Adding on to the last post about SUN and Scott, I got some figures and statistics in  urlLink this  article. Well ..... I think if these figures are to be believed then there is something realy wrong with SUN.   I would like to be as optimistic as Scott and others in this article.......  I think this calls for a good discussion......   Later Sachin Sharma

      During the second world war, the initial military successes of Japan in Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore, Burma and the Philippines, resulted in thousands of POWs becoming available for slave labour.   All these POWs were put to work on a very ambitious and very difficult (technically) railroad project called the  urlLink  Thai Burma Railroad  .   Following is a recount of the one of the POW who made it till the end of the war. I find a very very close similarity in today's software developers deployed on ambitious technical projects and those POWs.   You carried a basket from the digging area to the top of the embankment, emptied it and down again to be filled for your next trip up the hill. Or you carried a stretcher - two bamboo poles pushed through an empty rice sack - one chap at each end, and off you went. Simple really. But in reality this job was far from easy. The slopes of the embankments consisted of loose earth, clambering to the top was a case of sliding and slithering with a weight of earth in attendance. This proved to be very tiring on thigh muscles and painful, often resulting in crippling cramp. You just had to stop, you could not move. Whenever this occurred the Japs were on you with their heavy sticks, and beat the living daylight out of you. Somehow you got going again, if only to escape the blows. Also, the soil alongside the track varied considerably, affecting the volume of earth an individual could move during a day. At the start of each day a Jap would decide the total volume of earth to be dug out that day. By the nature of things, some finished earlier than others. The volume the following day was fixed by the fastest time obtained the previous day, thereby increasing the total workload of the entire team. It was a truly 'no win situation'. If a team was running late, everyone worked on until the volume for that day was achieved. This meant that the Japs also had to stay behind. They relieved their anger and frustration by random beatings of POWs, sometimes resulting in serious injuries.

      11 Rules of Life by  Bill Gates  !!   Bill Gates' recent speech at Mount Whitney High School in Visalia, California is worthwhile reading for anyone. Love him or hate him, he sure hit the nail on the head with this one. To anyone with kids of any age, and to all of us who were kids once, here is some advice Mr. Gates recently dished out at a speech to the Mount Whitney Student Assembly.  He talked about how feel-good, and politically correct teachings created a generation of kids with no concept of reality, and how this method was setting them up for failure in the real world.  He concluded by outlining the following 11 Rules:   Rule 1:  Life is not fair ... get used to it.  Rule 2:  The world won't care about your self-esteem. However, the world will expect you to accomplish something BEFORE you start feeling good about yourself.  Rule 3:  You will NOT make $40,000 a year right out of high school, and you won't be a vice-president with a car phone until you earn both.  Rule 4:  If you think your teacher is tough, wait until you get a boss.  Rule 5:  Flipping burgers at McDonalds should not be beneath your dignity. Your grandparents had a different word for burger flipping . . .. they called it OPPORTUNITY.  Rule 6:  If you mess up, it's not your parents' fault, so don't whine about your mistakes, learn from them.  Rule 7:  Before you were born, your parents weren't as boring as they are now. They got that way from paying your bills, cleaning your clothes and listening to you talk about how cool you are. So before you save the rain forest from the parasites of your parents' generation, try delousing the closet in your own bedroom.  Rule 8:  Your school may have done away with recognizing that there are winners and losers, but life has not. In some schools they have even abolished failing grades, and they'll give you as much time as you want to get the right answer on an exam. This doesn't bear the slightest resemblance to ANYTHING in real life.  Rule 9:  Life is not divided into semesters. You don't get summers off, and very few employers are interested in helping you find yourself. You are supposed to do that on your own time.  Rule 10:  Television is NOT real life. In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop, and go out and find a job.  Rule 11:  Be nice to NERDS. Chances are you will end up working for one.

      Had gone to a military-maintained Gurudwara [in Hyd] the other day, fully expecting to make a flying return :D but no one seemed to mind, so looked around a long time, nice place :)  Fundamentals of Sikhism: There is only one God. His Name is Truth. He is the Creator. He is without fear. He is without hate. He is beyond time. He is beyond birth and death. He is self-existent. He is realised by the Guru's grace.  Quote: Almighty grant me this boon. May I be not afraid from doing noble deeds, be never afraid when on the battlefield, may steel the will and fight with determination to win.  I like the fundas :) Go Sikhism!

        ~A Dream Pang~  I had withdrawn in forest, and my song Was swallowed up in leaves that blew away; And to the forest edge you came one day (this was my dream) and looked and pondered long, But did not enter, though the wish was strong: You shook your pensive head as who should say, "I dare not--too far in his footsteps stray-- He must seek me would he undo the wrong."  Not far, but near, I stood and saw it all, Behind low boughs the trees let down outside; And the sweet pang it cost me not to call and tell you that I saw does still abide. But 'tis not true that thus I dwelt aloof, For the wood wakes, and you are here for proof.   - Robert Frost

       Thought for Today by Andy Hunt   It is impossible to sharpen a pencil with a blunt ax. It is equally vain to try to do it with ten blunt axes instead.     -- Edsger Dijkstra   How many blunt axes are piling up in the corner of your desk? Do many of them have some sort of coffee-related pun in the name? Perhaps a smaller, sharper tool would be more appropriate. I've got Ruby on my Sharp Zaurus, and it's a real kick to be able to write good code on the go. The small screen isn't an issue, because it doesn't take much Ruby code to do something interesting.  Teams aren't immune from this effect, either. Ten inadequately skilled people can't get a project out the door no matter what wonderful IDE or process they use. But one sharp person can.  At some point, corporations will realize this, and take action to retain only the best people, and let the others go. Maybe they have already started.  If they have, then you need to make sure YOU are the one sharp person...

       Sun Tzu Says:    If you know the enemy     and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a     hundred battles.  If you know yourself but not the enemy,     for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.      If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will     succumb in every battle.

       It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted     with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand     the profitable way of carrying it on.    The Art of War (Sun Tzu)   The above observation is very similar to the one I am coming to realise these days:   A large part of being a good professional has got to do with your ability to know and understand how   not   to do things.

       Convince your enemy that he will gain very little by attacking you. This will diminish his anthusiasm.  Even if you are very strong, never be ashamed to feign weakness; this will make your enemy act imprudently and attack too soon.  In war, the key to victory is the ability to surprise one's opponent.            The Art of War  (Sun Tzu)

        The warrior of light sometimes behaves like water, flowing around the obstacles he encounters.     The warrior of light sometimes behaves like water, flowing around the obstacles he encounters.  Occaisionally, resisting might mean being destroyed, and so he adapts to the circumstances. He accepts without complains that the stones along the path hinder his way across the mountains.  Therein lies the strength of water: it cannot be shattered by a hammer or wounded by a knife. The strongest sword in the world cannot scar its surface.   The waters of a river adapt themselves to whatever route proves possible, but river never forgets its one objective: the sea. So fragile at its source, it gradually gathers the strength of the other rivers it encounters.   And, after a certain point its power is absolute.      The warrior of light cannot always choose his battle field     The warrior of light cannot always choose his battlefield.  Sometimes he is taken by surprise in the middle of battles not of his choosing, but there is no point in running away,  those battles will merely follow him .           - Paulo Coelho (Manual of the Warrior of Light)

      Random  email forward -  There was a millionaire who collected live alligators. He kept them in the pool in back of his mansion. The millionaire also had a beautiful daughter who was single.  One day, the millionaire decides to throw a huge party, and during the party he announces, "My dear guests, I have a proposition to every man here. I will give one million dollars, or my daughter, to the man who can swim across this pool full of alligators and emerge unharmed!"  As soon as he finished his last word, there was the sound of a large splash in the pool. The guy in the pool was swimming with all his might, and the crowd began to cheer him on. Finally, he made it to the other side of the pool unharmed.  The millionaire was impressed. He said, "That was incredible! Fantastic! I didn't think it could be done! Well, I must keep my end of the bargain. Do you want my daughter or the one million dollars?"  The guy catches his breath, and then says, "Listen, I don't want your money! And I don't want your daughter! I want the jerk who pushed me in the pool!"

A banker is a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining and wants it back the minute it begins to rain. (Mark Twain)   An economist is an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday didn't happen today.   A statistician is someone who is good with numbers but lacks the personality to be an accountant.   A programmer is someone who solves a problem you didn't know you had in a way you don't understand.   A lawyer is a person who writes a 10,000 word document and calls it a "brief."   A psychologist is a man who watches everyone else when a beautiful girl enters the room.   A professor is one who talks in someone else's sleep.   A schoolteacher is a disillusioned person who used to think they liked children.   A consultant is someone who takes the watch off your wrist and tells you the time.   A diplomat is someone who can tell you to go to hades in such a way that you will look forward to the trip.

      If the build takes too long,  urlLink G C F L !   Those kids    - A Sunday school teacher was discussing the Ten Commandments with her five- and six-year-olds. After explaining the commandment to "honor thy father and thy mother," she asked "Is there a commandment that teaches us how to treat our brothers and sisters?" Without missing a beat one little boy answered, "Thou shall not kill."   - An honest seven-year-old told her parents that Billy Brown had kissed her after class. "How did that happen?" gasped her mother. "It wasn't easy," admitted the young lady, "but three girls helped me catch him."   - One day, a little girl is sitting and watching her mother do the dishes at the kitchen sink. She suddenly notices that her mother has several strands of white hair sticking out in contrast on her brunette head. "Why are some of your hairs white, Mom?" she asks. Her mother replies, "Well, every time you do something wrong and make me cry or unhappy, one of my hairs turns white." The little girl thinks about this awhile, then asks, "So how come ALL of Grandma's hairs are white?"   - For weeks, a six-year old lad kept telling his first-grade teacher about the baby brother or sister that was expected at his house. One day the mother allowed the boy to feel the movements of the unborn child. The six-year old was obviously impressed, but made no comment. Furthermore, he stopped telling his teacher about the impending event. The teacher finally sat the boy on her lap and said, "Tommy, whatever has become of that baby brother or sister you were expecting at home?" Tommy burst into tears and confessed, "I think Mommy ate it!"

      The Speech  Somewhere in England, June 5th, 1944  The big camp buzzed with a tension. For hundreds of eager rookies, newly arrived from the states, it was a great day in their lives. This day marked their first taste of the "real thing". Now they were not merely puppets in brown uniforms. They were not going through the motions of soldiering with three thousand miles of ocean between them and English soil. They were actually in the heart of England itself. They were waiting for the arrival of that legendary figure, Lieutenant General George S. Patton, Jr. Old "Blood and Guts" himself, about whom many a colorful chapter would be written for the school boys of tomorrow. Patton of the brisk, purposeful stride. Patton of the harsh, compelling voice, the lurid vocabulary, the grim and indomitable spirit that carried him and his Army to glory in Africa and Sicily. They called him "America's Fightingest General". He was no desk commando. He was the man who was sent for when the going got rough and a fighter was needed. He was the most hated and feared American of all on the part of the German Army.  Patton was coming and the stage was being set. He would address a move which might have a far reaching effect on the global war that, at the moment, was a TOP-SECRET in the files in Washington, D.C.  The men saw the camp turn out "en masse" for the first time and in full uniform, too. Today their marching was not lackadaisical. It was serious and the men felt the difference. From the lieutenants in charge of the companies on down in rank they felt the difference.  In long columns they marched down the hill from the barracks. They counted cadence while marching. They turned off to the left, up the rise and so on down into the roped off field where the General was to speak. Gold braid and stripes were everywhere. Soon, company by company, the hillside was a solid mass of brown. It was a beautiful fresh English morning. The tall trees lined the road and swayed gently in the breeze. Across the field, a British farmer calmly tilled his soil. High upon a nearby hill a group of British soldiers huddled together, waiting for the coming of the General. Military Police were everywhere wearing their white leggings, belts, and helmets. They were brisk and grim. The twittering of the birds in the trees could be heard above the dull murmur of the crowd and soft, white clouds floated lazily overhead as the men settled themselves and lit cigarettes.  On the special platform near the speakers stand, Colonels and Majors were a dime a dozen. Behind the platform stood General Patton's "Guard of Honor"; all specially chosen men. At their right was a band playing rousing marches while the crowd waited and on the platform a nervous sergeant repeatedly tested the loudspeaker. The moment grew near and the necks began to crane to view the tiny winding road that led to Stourport-on-Severn. A captain stepped to the microphone. "When the General arrives," he said sonorously, "the band will play the Generals March and you will all stand at attention."  By now the rumor had gotten around that Lieutenant General Simpson, Commanding General of the Fourth Army, was to be with General Patton. The men stirred expectantly. Two of the big boys in one day!  At last, the long black car, shining resplendently in the bright sun, roared up the road, preceded by a jeep full of Military Police. A dead hush fell over the hillside. There he was! Impeccably dressed. With knee high, brown, gleaming boots, shiny helmet, and his Colt .45 Peacemaker swinging in its holster on his right side.  Patton strode down the incline and then straight to the stiff backed "Guard of Honor". He looked them up and down. He peered intently into their faces and surveyed their backs. He moved through the ranks of the statuesque band like an avenging wraith and, apparently satisfied, mounted the platform with Lieutenant General Simpson and Major General Cook, the Corps Commander, at his side.  Major General Cook then introduced Lieutenant General Simpson, whose Army was still in America, preparing for their part in the war.  "We are here", said General Simpson, "to listen to the words of a great man. A man who will lead you all into whatever you may face with heroism, ability, and foresight. A man who has proven himself amid shot and shell. My greatest hope is that some day soon, I will have my own Army fighting with his, side by side."  General Patton arose and strode swiftly to the microphone. The men snapped to their feet and stood silently. Patton surveyed the sea of brown with a grim look. "Be seated", he said. The words were not a request, but a command. The General's voice rose high and clear.  "Men, this stuff that some sources sling around about America wanting out of this war, not wanting to fight, is a crock of bullshit. Americans love to fight, traditionally. All real Americans love the sting and clash of battle. You are here today for three reasons. First, because you are here to defend your homes and your loved ones. Second, you are here for your own self respect, because you would not want to be anywhere else. Third, you are here because you are real men and all real men like to fight. When you, here, everyone of you, were kids, you all admired the champion marble player, the fastest runner, the toughest boxer, the big league ball players, and the All-American football players. Americans love a winner. Americans will not tolerate a loser. Americans despise cowards. Americans play to win all of the time. I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed. That's why Americans have never lost nor will ever lose a war; for the very idea of losing is hateful to an American."  The General paused and looked over the crowd. "You are not all going to die," he said slowly. "Only two percent of you right here today would die in a major battle. Death must not be feared. Death, in time, comes to all men. Yes, every man is scared in his first battle. If he says he's not, he's a liar. Some men are cowards but they fight the same as the brave men or they get the hell slammed out of them watching men fight who are just as scared as they are. The real hero is the man who fights even though he is scared. Some men get over their fright in a minute under fire. For some, it takes an hour. For some, it takes days. But a real man will never let his fear of death overpower his honor, his sense of duty to his country, and his innate manhood. Battle is the most magnificent competition in which a human being can indulge. It brings out all that is best and it removes all that is base. Americans pride themselves on being He Men and they ARE He Men. Remember that the enemy is just as frightened as you are, and probably more so. They are not supermen."  "All through your Army careers, you men have bitched about what you call "chicken shit drilling". That, like everything else in this Army, has a definite purpose. That purpose is alertness. Alertness must be bred into every soldier. I don't give a fuck for a man who's not always on his toes. You men are veterans or you wouldn't be here. You are ready for what's to come. A man must be alert at all times if he expects to stay alive. If you're not alert, sometime, a German son-of-an-asshole-bitch is going to sneak up behind you and beat you to death with a sockful of shit!" The men roared in agreement.  Patton's grim expression did not change. "There are four hundred neatly marked graves somewhere in Sicily", he roared into the microphone, "All because one man went to sleep on the job". He paused and the men grew silent. "But they are German graves, because we caught the bastard asleep before they did". The General clutched the microphone tightly, his jaw out-thrust, and he continued, "An Army is a team. It lives, sleeps, eats, and fights as a team. This individual heroic stuff is pure horse shit. The bilious bastards who write that kind of stuff for the Saturday Evening Post don't know any more about real fighting under fire than they know about fucking!"  The men slapped their legs and rolled in glee. This was Patton as the men had imagined him to be, and in rare form, too. He hadn't let them down. He was all that he was cracked up to be, and more. He had IT!  "We have the finest food, the finest equipment, the best spirit, and the best men in the world", Patton bellowed. He lowered his head and shook it pensively. Suddenly he snapped erect, faced the men belligerently and thundered, "Why, by God, I actually pity those poor sons-of-bitches we're going up against. By God, I do". The men clapped and howled delightedly. There would be many a barracks tale about the "Old Man's" choice phrases. They would become part and parcel of Third Army's history and they would become the bible of their slang.  "My men don't surrender", Patton continued, "I don't want to hear of any soldier under my command being captured unless he has been hit. Even if you are hit, you can still fight back. That's not just bull shit either. The kind of man that I want in my command is just like the lieutenant in Libya, who, with a Luger against his chest, jerked off his helmet, swept the gun aside with one hand, and busted the hell out of the Kraut with his helmet. Then he jumped on the gun and went out and killed another German before they knew what the hell was coming off. And, all of that time, this man had a bullet through a lung. There was a real man!"  Patton stopped and the crowd waited. He continued more quietly, "All of the real heroes are not storybook combat fighters, either. Every single man in this Army plays a vital role. Don't ever let up. Don't ever think that your job is unimportant. Every man has a job to do and he must do it. Every man is a vital link in the great chain. What if every truck driver suddenly decided that he didn't like the whine of those shells overhead, turned yellow, and jumped headlong into a ditch? The cowardly bastard could say, "Hell, they won't miss me, just one man in thousands". But, what if every man thought that way? Where in the hell would we be now? What would our country, our loved ones, our homes, even the world, be like? No, Goddamnit, Americans don't think like that. Every man does his job. Every man serves the whole. Every department, every unit, is important in the vast scheme of this war. The ordnance men are needed to supply the guns and machinery of war to keep us rolling. The Quartermaster is needed to bring up food and clothes because where we are going there isn't a hell of a lot to steal. Every last man on K.P. has a job to do, even the one who heats our water to keep us from getting the 'G.I. Shits'."  Patton paused, took a deep breath, and continued, "Each man must not think only of himself, but also of his buddy fighting beside him. We don't want yellow cowards in this Army. They should be killed off like rats. If not, they will go home after this war and breed more cowards. The brave men will breed more brave men. Kill off the Goddamned cowards and we will have a nation of brave men. One of the bravest men that I ever saw was a fellow on top of a telegraph pole in the midst of a furious fire fight in Tunisia. I stopped and asked what the hell he was doing up there at a time like that. He answered, "Fixing the wire, Sir". I asked, "Isn't that a little unhealthy right about now?" He answered, "Yes Sir, but the Goddamned wire has to be fixed". I asked, "Don't those planes strafing the road bother you?" And he answered, "No, Sir, but you sure as hell do!" Now, there was a real man. A real soldier. There was a man who devoted all he had to his duty, no matter how seemingly insignificant his duty might appear at the time, no matter how great the odds. And you should have seen those trucks on the rode to Tunisia. Those drivers were magnificent. All day and all night they rolled over those son-of-a-bitching roads, never stopping, never faltering from their course, with shells bursting all around them all of the time. We got through on good old American guts. Many of those men drove for over forty consecutive hours. These men weren't combat men, but they were soldiers with a job to do. They did it, and in one hell of a way they did it. They were part of a team. Without team effort, without them, the fight would have been lost. All of the links in the chain pulled together and the chain became unbreakable."  The General paused and stared challengingly over the silent ocean of men. One could have heard a pin drop anywhere on that vast hillside. The only sound was the stirring of the breeze in the leaves of the bordering trees and the busy chirping of the birds in the branches of the trees at the General's left.  "Don't forget," Patton barked, "you men don't know that I'm here. No mention of that fact is to be made in any letters. The world is not supposed to know what the hell happened to me. I'm not supposed to be commanding this Army. I'm not even supposed to be here in England. Let the first bastards to find out be the Goddamned Germans. Some day I want to see them raise up on their piss-soaked hind legs and howl, 'Jesus Christ, it's the Goddamned Third Army again and that son-of-a-fucking-bitch Patton'."  "We want to get the hell over there", Patton continued, "The quicker we clean up this Goddamned mess, the quicker we can take a little jaunt against the purple pissing Japs and clean out their nest, too. Before the Goddamned Marines get all of the credit."  The men roared approval and cheered delightedly. This statement had real significance behind it. Much more than met the eye and the men instinctively sensed the fact. They knew that they themselves were going to play a very great part in the making of world history. They were being told as much right now. Deep sincerity and seriousness lay behind the General's colorful words. The men knew and understood it. They loved the way he put it, too, as only he could.  Patton continued quietly, "Sure, we want to go home. We want this war over with. The quickest way to get it over with is to go get the bastards who started it. The quicker they are whipped, the quicker we can go home. The shortest way home is through Berlin and Tokyo. And when we get to Berlin", he yelled, "I am personally going to shoot that paper hanging son-of-a-bitch Hitler. Just like I'd shoot a snake!"  "When a man is lying in a shell hole, if he just stays there all day, a German will get to him eventually. The hell with that idea. The hell with taking it. My men don't dig foxholes. I don't want them to. Foxholes only slow up an offensive. Keep moving. And don't give the enemy time to dig one either. We'll win this war, but we'll win it only by fighting and by showing the Germans that we've got more guts than they have; or ever will have. We're not going to just shoot the sons-of-bitches, we're going to rip out their living Goddamned guts and use them to grease the treads of our tanks. We're going to murder those lousy Hun cocksuckers by the bushel-fucking-basket. War is a bloody, killing business. You've got to spill their blood, or they will spill yours. Rip them up the belly. Shoot them in the guts. When shells are hitting all around you and you wipe the dirt off your face and realize that instead of dirt it's the blood and guts of what once was your best friend beside you, you'll know what to do!"  "I don't want to get any messages saying, "I am holding my position." We are not holding a Goddamned thing. Let the Germans do that. We are advancing constantly and we are not interested in holding onto anything, except the enemy's balls. We are going to twist his balls and kick the living shit out of him all of the time. Our basic plan of operation is to advance and to keep on advancing regardless of whether we have to go over, under, or through the enemy. We are going to go through him like crap through a goose; like shit through a tin horn!"  "From time to time there will be some complaints that we are pushing our people too hard. I don't give a good Goddamn about such complaints. I believe in the old and sound rule that an ounce of sweat will save a gallon of blood. The harder WE push, the more Germans we will kill. The more Germans we kill, the fewer of our men will be killed. Pushing means fewer casualties. I want you all to remember that."  The General paused. His eagle like eyes swept over the hillside. He said with pride, "There is one great thing that you men will all be able to say after this war is over and you are home once again. You may be thankful that twenty years from now when you are sitting by the fireplace with your grandson on your knee and he asks you what you did in the great World War II, you WON'T have to cough, shift him to the other knee and say, "Well, your Granddaddy shoveled shit in Louisiana." No, Sir, you can look him straight in the eye and say, "Son, your Granddaddy rode with the Great Third Army and a Son-of-a-Goddamned-Bitch named Georgie Patton!"   -  urlLink General George S.

      From NYTimes (via Slashdot):  urlLink The Farewell Dossier  - Intelligence shortcomings, as we see, have a thousand fathers; secret intelligence triumphs are orphans. Here is the unremarked story of "the Farewell dossier": how a C.I.A. campaign of computer sabotage resulting in a huge explosion in Siberia — all engineered by a mild-mannered economist named Gus Weiss — helped [the west] win the cold war.

      Friends, Romans [ok, Indians/NRIs :-D], Countrymen, blahblahbleh:  Today is an important day. Today is March 31st. Today is the day... *funny _toing_ sound* the Squawkbox commenting account for this blog expires. So...  What I expect is that the database will be locked up tomorrow and the links will be disabled in either case. Lite :) As I said when I put it up, will use it so long as its free, and then we'll see. So HaloScan's in. Will probably remove the older thing in a couple of days.  End of raving dynamic gigantic speech! Can we have a standing ovation please!!! :-D

      The Tavern  All day I think about it, then at night I say it. Where did I come from, and what am I supposed to be doing? I have no idea. My soul is from elsewhere, I'm sure of that, And I intend to end up there.  This drunkenness began in some other tavern. When I get back around to that place, I'll be completely sober. Meanwhile, I'm like a bird from another continent, sitting in this aviary. The day is coming when I fly off, But who is it now in my ear who hears my voice? Who says words with my mouth?  Who looks out with my eyes? What is the soul? I cannot stop asking. If I could taste one sip of an answer, I could break out of this prison for drunks. I didn't come here of my own accord, and I can't leave that way. Whoever brought me here will have to take me home.  This poetry. I never know what I'm going to say. I don't plan it. When I'm outside the saying of it, I get very quiet and rarely speak at all.  We have a huge barrel of wine, but no cups. That's fine with us. Every morning We glow and in the evening we glow again.  They say there's no future for us. They're right. Which is fine with us.   - Jalaluddin Rumi

      Exercise in Reality  The Moon is dark it helps me see but is this really reality? I stay awake and I see things that make me shake the wind is still my hair is blowing I want to know where am I going? Daylight has come but I can't see if this is really reality. My eyes are open but still I sleep I still see things that make me shake the wind is blowing but all is still now I know That I am here.   - Jason Raymer

I think you $hould be under$tanding of the need$ of u$ worker$ who have given $o much $upport including $weat and $ervice to your company.   I am $ure you will gue$$ what I mean and re$pond $oon.   Your$ $incerely,   Norman $oh   The next day, the employee received this letter of reply:  Dear NOrman,   I kNOw you have been working very hard. NOwadays, NOthing much has changed. You must have NOticed that our company is NOt doing NOticeably well as yet.   NOw the newspaper are saying the world`s leading ecoNOmists are NOt sure if the United States may go into aNOther recession. After the NOvember presidential elections things may turn bad.   I have NOthing more to add NOw. You kNOw what I mean.   Yours truly,   &lt;Manager&gt;

All prove to be false in the long run and all cause big trouble and painful learning experiences.   1.  The network is reliable  2.  Latency is zero   3.  Bandwidth is infinite   4.  The network is secure   5.  Topology doesn't change   6.  There is one administrator   7.  Transport cost is zero   8.  The network is homogeneous    Too impressed?

      Graham also shares ideas on how to produce work from other creative fields and advises hackers to apply these tools to their own endeavors. Writers and painters know that good work is the result of an enormous amount of reworking or rewriting and are taught to be patient with the process of figuring out what they are trying to create. But programmers, Graham writes, are taught that they should "figure out a program completely on paper before even going near a computer."  "I found that I did not program this way.... Instead of patiently writing out a complete program and assuring myself it was correct, I tended to just spew out code that was hopelessly broken, and gradually beat it into shape. Debugging, I was taught, was a kind of final pass where you caught typos and oversights. The way I worked, it seemed like programming consisted of debugging."  :-) Brand new addition to the hit-list:  urlLink Hackers and Painters   and btw, I picked this up from the Random Wired search on the side-bar :-) I rock!

      I like this one :-)  --  From GCFL: http://www.gcfl.net/archive/archive.php?funny=19981023  Friday, October 23, 1998  /* This is a long, but good inspirational piece. It'll give you something to ponder during the weekend... */  From Guideposts (don't know exact issue)  --   Information Please   When I was quite young, my father had one of the first telephones in our neighborhood. I remember well the polished old case fastened to the wall. The shiny receiver hung on the side of the box. I was too little to reach the telephone, but used to listen with fascination when my mother used to talk to it. Then I discovered that somewhere inside the wonderful device lived an amazing person - her name was "Information Please" and there was nothing she did not know. "Information Please" could supply anybody's number and the correct time.  My first personal experience with this genie-in the-bottle came one day while my mother was visiting a neighbor. Amusing myself at the tool bench in the basement, I whacked my finger with a hammer. The pain was terrible, but there didn't seem to be any reason in crying because there was no one home to give sympathy. I walked around the house sucking my throbbing finger, finally arriving at the stairway.  The telephone! Quickly, I ran for the foot stool in the parlor and dragged it to the landing. Climbing up, I unhooked the receiver in the parlor and held it to my ear. "Information Please," I said into the mouthpiece just above my head. A click or two and a small clear voice spoke into my ear.  "Information."  "I hurt my finger..." I wailed into the phone. The tears came readily enough now that I had an audience.  "Isn't your mother home?" came the question.  "Nobody's home but me." I blubbered.  "Are you bleeding?" the voice asked.  "No," I replied. "I hit my finger with the hammer and it hurts."  "Can you open your icebox?" she asked. I said I could. "Then chip off a little piece of ice and hold it to your finger," said the voice.  After that, I called "Information Please" for everything. I asked her for help with my geography and she told me where Philadelphia was. She helped me with my math. She told me my pet chipmunk, that I had caught in the park just he day before, would eat fruit and nuts.  Then, there was the time Petey, our pet canary died. I called "Information Please" and told her the sad story. She listened, then said the usual things grown-ups say to soothe a child. But I was unconsoled. I asked her, "Why is it that birds should sing so beautifully and bring joy to all families, only to end up as a heap of feathers on the bottom of a cage?"  She must have sensed my deep concern, for she said quietly, "Paul, always remember that there are other worlds to sing in." Somehow I felt better.  Another day I was on the telephone. "Information Please."  "Information," said the now familiar voice.  "How do you spell fix?" I asked.  All this took place in a small town in the Pacific Northwest. When I was 9 years old, we moved across the country to Boston. I missed my friend very much.  "Information Please" belonged in that old wooden box back home, and I somehow never thought of trying the tall, shiny new phone that sat on the table in the hall.  As I grew into my teens, the memories of those childhood conversations never really left me. Often, in moments of doubt and perplexity I would recall the serene sense of security I had then. I appreciated now how patient, understanding, and kind she was to have spent her time on a little boy.  A few years later, on my way west to college, my plane put down in Seattle. I had about half an hour or so between planes. I spent 15 minutes or so on the phone with my sister, who lived there now. Then without thinking what I was doing, I dialed my hometown operator and said, "Information, Please." Miraculously, I heard the small, clear voice I knew so well, "Information."  I hadn't planned this but I heard myself saying, "Could you please tell me how to spell fix?"  There was a long pause. Then came the soft spoken answer, "I guess your finger must have healed by now."  I laughed. "So it's really still you," I said. "I wonder if you have any idea how much you meant to me during that time."  "I wonder," she said, "if you know how much your calls meant to me. I never had any children, and I used to look forward to your calls."  I told her how often I had thought of her over the years and I asked if I could call her again when I came back to visit my sister.  "Please do," she said. "Just ask for Sally."  Three months later I was back in Seattle. A different voice answered "Information."  I asked for Sally.  "Are you a friend?" She said.  "Yes, a very old friend," I answered.  "I'm sorry to have to tell you this, she said. Sally had been working part-time the last few years because she was sick. She died five weeks ago."  Before I could hang up she said, "Wait a minute. Did you say your name was Paul?"  "Yes."  "Well, Sally left a message for you. She wrote it down in case you called.  Let me read it to you." The note said, "Tell him I still say there are other worlds to sing in. He'll know what I mean."  I thanked her and hung up. I knew what Sally meant.   - Anonymous  Never underestimate the impression you may make on others. Whose life have you touched today?

      GCFL :-)      Memorial Stone     A woman's husband dies. He had $20,000 to his name. After everything is done at the funeral home and cemetery, she tells her closest friend that there is no money left.      The friend says, "How can that be? You told me he had $20,000 a few days before he died. How could you be broke?"       The widow says, "Well, the funeral cost me $6,500. And of course, I had to make the obligatory donation for the church and the organist and all. That was $500, and I spent another $500 for the wake, food and drinks, you know. The rest went for the memorial stone."       The friend says, "$12,500 for the memorial stone? My stars, how big was it?"       The widow says, "Three carats!"      Bachelor Cooking     Two confirmed bachelors were sitting and talking. Their conversation drifted from sports to cooking.      "I got a cookbook once," said the first, "but I could never do anything with it."       "Too much fancy cooking in it?" asked the second.       "You said it. Every one of the recipes began the same way, 'Take a clean dish and...'"           Get Back In There!     Working as a secretary at an international airport, my sister had an office adjacent to where security temporarily holds suspects.      One day security officers were questioning a man when they were suddenly called away on another emergency. To the horror of my sister and her colleagues, the man was left alone in the unlocked room. After a few minutes, the door opened, and he began to walk out. Summoning up her courage, one of the secretaries barked, "Get back in there, and don't come out until you're told!"       The man scuttled back inside and slammed the door. When the security people returned, the woman reported what had happened.       Without a word, an officer walked into the room and released one very frightened telephone repairman.      Hospital Regulations     Hospital regulations require a wheelchair for patients being discharged. However, while working as a student nurse, I found one elderly gentleman--already dressed and sitting on the bed with a suitcase at his feet--who insisted he didn't need my help to leave the hospital. After a chat about rules being rules, he reluctantly let me wheel him to the elevator. On the way down I asked him if his wife was meeting him.      "I don't know," he said.  "She's still upstairs in the bathroom changing out of her hospital gown."

      :)) Zen stories:  --  When the spiritual teacher and his disciples began their evening meditation, the cat who lived in the monastery made such noise that it distracted them. So the teacher ordered that the cat be tied up during the evening practice. Years later, when the teacher died, the cat continued to be tied up during the meditation session. And when the cat eventually died, another cat was brought to the monastery and tied up. Centuries later, learned descendants of the spiritual teacher wrote scholarly treatises about the religious significance of tying up a cat for meditation practice.  --  Four monks decided to meditate silently without speaking for two weeks. By nightfall on the first day, the candle began to flicker and then went out. The first monk said, "Oh, no! The candle is out." The second monk said, "Aren't we not suppose to talk?" The third monk said, "Why must you two break the silence?" The fourth monk laughed and said, "Ha! I'm the only one who didn't speak."  --  There was once a stone cutter who was dissatisfied with himself and with his position in life.  One day he passed a wealthy merchant's house. Through the open gateway, he saw many fine possessions and important visitors. "How powerful that merchant must be!" thought the stone cutter. He became very envious and wished that he could be like the merchant.  To his great surprise, he suddenly became the merchant, enjoying more luxuries and power than he had ever imagined, but envied and detested by those less wealthy than himself. Soon a high official passed by, carried in a sedan chair, accompanied by attendants and escorted by soldiers beating gongs. Everyone, no matter how wealthy, had to bow low before the procession. "How powerful that official is!" he thought. "I wish that I could be a high official!"  Then he became the high official, carried everywhere in his embroidered sedan chair, feared and hated by the people all around. It was a hot summer day, so the official felt very uncomfortable in the sticky sedan chair. He looked up at the sun. It shone proudly in the sky, unaffected by his presence. "How powerful the sun is!" he thought. "I wish that I could be the sun!"  Then he became the sun, shining fiercely down on everyone, scorching the fields, cursed by the farmers and laborers. But a huge black cloud moved between him and the earth, so that his light could no longer shine on everything below. "How powerful that storm cloud is!" he thought. "I wish that I could be a cloud!"  Then he became the cloud, flooding the fields and villages, shouted at by everyone. But soon he found that he was being pushed away by some great force, and realized that it was the wind. "How powerful it is!" he thought. "I wish that I could be the wind!"  Then he became the wind, blowing tiles off the roofs of houses, uprooting trees, feared and hated by all below him. But after a while, he ran up against something that would not move, no matter how forcefully he blew against it - a huge, towering rock. "How powerful that rock is!" he thought. "I wish that I could be a rock!"  Then he became the rock, more powerful than anything else on earth. But as he stood there, he heard the sound of a hammer pounding a chisel into the hard surface, and felt himself being changed. "What could be more powerful than I, the rock?" he thought.  He looked down and saw far below him the figure of a stone cutter.

      J Krishnamurthy related a joke about a Soviet astronaut. There was this Soviet astronaut, he said, who had gone to the moon and returned to Moscow. The astronaut was feted by the Soviet people and the final reception before his world tour was held in the Kremlin. The Kremlin reception rooms, with their high domes, huge chandeliers and plush red carpets were packed to capacity.  The Soviet President, Brezhnev took the astronaut to a quiet corridor and asked: "Tell me, when you went up there, did you see God?". The astronaut, looked around cautiously and replied in a whisper "Yes, I did." Brezhnev said: "I thought as much, but make certain that you do not tell anybody else about this."  The astronaut left on his world tour and he was given grand receptions in Germany, in England and in the United States. The final reception of the world tour was in the Vatican in Rome. The reception rooms in the Vatican with their high domes, huge chandeliers and plush red carpets were packed to capacity. The Pope invited the astronaut to a secluded corridor and asked: " Tell me, when you went up there, did you see God?"  The astronaut looked around cautiously, and remembering Brezhnev's command, replied: "No, I did not see God." The Pope said: "I thought as much, but please do not tell anybody else about this."  :))

       urlLink Amnesty International - India    What is this link ?    Amnesty International has released their human rights report 2004 (covering January to December 2003). This report covers the human rights situation in a variety of countries. The link given above points to the report on India.   What should I do ?    First, read the report. Next, forward it to as many friends as possible, and urge them to read the report.   What does it say ?    Following are some points taken from the report. Do read the complete report for context -   Socially and economically marginalized groups, such as dalits, adivasis, women and religious minorities, including Muslims, continued to face discrimination at the hands of the police, the criminal justice system and non-state actors.    The Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) continued to be used to detain political opponents and members of minority populations.     Members of the security services continued to enjoy virtual impunity for human rights violations.     At least 33 people were sentenced to death in 2003. (Also read  urlLink Sentenced to die, non-unanimously )    The majority of those sentenced to death are poor and illiterate.
