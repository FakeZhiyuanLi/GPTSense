       Change of plans. Staying in Vancouver after all.  My "Papa" is heading to Greenwood as my cousin will be there and he is rarely home, as he is in the Navy.  So... have postponed my trip to mid September now.  :-(     Have devised new ways of keeping the loft cool. Remembered the block of ice in front of the fan trick. Plus have rediscovered the joy of theatre air conditioning and have seen Spiderman II, DeLovely and Bourne Supremacy (not all the supreme). Expect to check out a few more this weekend.    The place smells fantastic as have several bunches of fragrant Lilly's about the place. I finally got my proper ottoman. (had to file complaint with BBB) Filling up the long weekend with lots of local activities.  Am planning to visit a Corn Maze (not maize haha)  in the valley. A giant one that Canadian Tire has done. If I get lost in it...can I still get some oil for the car? Will try swimming again outdoors with SPF 30 this time.  Friends coming over for a dinner party on Saturday and then to watch fireworks.      On Wednesday I made an important discovery. Sherwood hates fireworks due to unfortunate incident in puppyhood.  He will bark for the first 10 minutes and then go hide in the bathroom.  I came home and turned out the lights, lit the candles, put on the music (kinda loud) and sipped on fresh lemonade to watch the fireworks.  No barking. He can't here it when the music is on. It took me how many years to figure this out? Answer: 10....!    Have decided to spend Christmas &amp; New Years in Newcastle/London this year with my friends and have started making plans. Must find excellent babysitter for Sherwood. The hard part.

      After a long walk in Shaughnessey I lit some candles, cranked up Cheryl Crow, smoked a few american cigarettes,  sipped on fresh lemonade and watched the firworks light up the sky.  Dreaming of loves now and then.  Goodnight.

      Woke up to thunder and lightening this morning and Sherwood nosing his way through the bed curtains to make sure I was all right, before he went and hid in the bathroom.  Been back at work.  I am tired, I have done allot of growing this past year. A sad but good tired.   I feel that I am finally coming to terms with all the "crap" from my past. Not happy about it (who is) but finally able to accept it. I think this past year, with my Sister in town and some new information coming to light a few weeks ago, that I am finally in control and it doesn't control me. It has taken 42 years for the truth and the secrets to be unraveled and exposed. I am still a bit pissed and in mourning for the life I could have had if I had grown up in a relatively normal family.  I don't think I am necessarily feeling sorry for myself, I know some have it better and some have it worse. However, I see now very clearly what it did to me, who I am because of it and am ready to accept it and move on. I am writing all sorts onto a diary/blogg and it is very cathartic. I have an appointment with the shrink on the 15th and this may be helpful.  Although I am tired, I feel stronger and more resolved than ever before.  I know I am moving on to a life with a steady calm and boundless joy no more "hidden fears and dark secrets".  This will be a wonderful new season to my life. I must begin meditating and connecting to the "infinite intelligent" or God as some call it on a daily basis.  Previously it was a bit hap hazard. This is where I will get my energy and inspiration from.  Light a single candle. This is the one thing I must do every single day and the rest of the things I want to achieve will follow. Have you ever felt you have been in direct contact with God?  I think we touched briefly on this once.

      Please excuse my grammar and spelling. This blog does not have spell check and you can't even cut and paste. It is very tiring emotionally to write this and I can't be bothered at the moment to fix the mistakes.  Thanks for bearing with me.

      The thing is I feel overwhelmed by my past. I feel I am basically programmed since birth to have an extremely difficult life because of the abuse I suffered, mostly from my father as a child. As a result I have become a victim and I have unknowingly sought out men that are just like my dad. These are my father's traits: physically, emotionally and verbally abusive, he suffered a serious life altering head injury and now it turns out was sexually molested. These are all the same traits of the men I have been involved with. Mostly the victim pattern has resolved itself after one therapist taught me how to stop someone from abusing me.  I had done so much work to ensure I would not be involved with someone that was emotionally or physically abusive. Years ago I was dating a great guy and then he is attacked and suffers a serious life altering head injury, which effectively ends the relationship. The same as my father. Then I date a guy who it turns out has been sexually abused by his mother. This really fried my brain. He even seemed to have multiple personalities. There was a time when he became a 4 year old child for several days. After this I started to suspect my father had been sexually abused and then one day my sister came out with it. Yep, our father had been sexually molested... although I don't know by who. My father had mentioned this to her one day.  When do my fathers nightmares stop haunting or stalking me? What's next? That is why I feel so hopeless. And to top it all off my father is still managing long distance to abuse me emotionally and verbally. I try to have as little contact as possible with him but he says things to my mother or sister that eventually gets to me. Horrible outrageous things that they actually believe at times. For instance when I was in Broadcast Journalism school my father (in Kamloops) told me to stop lying. He said he knew I was not going to school and that I was probably prostituting myself to pay the rent. Even though my mother had come down one weekend to help me study... this rumour persisted in my family. Absolutely outrageous and completely untrue.  My sister lived here in Vancouver for the past year. She came to take a one year course and was away from her husband and dog who were in Kamloops. At first it was very difficult to spend time together. She had a lot of negative pre-conceived notions about my life that stemmed from my father's "bullshit" about me. I had to set a lot of boundaries. With patience, consistency and some good communication tools I feel she got to know the real me and in fact she acknowledged this. However, there was a point where my back was hurting me incredibly bad and I was at my sisters house. I went to get off the couch and I yelled out in agony when I moved and then swore. Instead of offering me help to get to the hospital or even to my car. She just stood there and said "you are abusing me... don't swear at me." I said somewhat calmly I am not swearing at you I am swearing because I am in so much pain. I managed to get myself out the door... barely able to walk and she said don't bother to come back. It was unbelievable. I went over this with her a few times and then I think she finally got how horrible it was that she didn't help me. That's how I felt all my life with my family. I can be in incredible pain physically and emotionally and they just ignore me.  I recently figured out what happened to the dog that was around our home when I was about 2 years old. My father either beat it to death or why trying to beat it it ran away and was hit by a car. Now I know why my Mother insisted whenever my sister and I wanted to get a dog that she was allergic. It turns out she is not and she babysits my sisters dog all the time.  I still carry this constant irrational fear of something unknown since childhood with me. I don't enjoy life like someone from from a relatively normal family. My family has not helped me they have hindered me in every possible way. I mourn for the life I could have had, I really do. I have natural intelligence, beauty and compassion and it has mostly been untapped. I have no real idea of what it feels like to receive unconditional supportive love and therefore will never be able to attract it into my life. Unless, by some miracle God sees fit to give me a fucking break and bring someone decent into my life. There are many things I can do to change my life but I can't make someone love me and it is the only thing I want out of this life.  I have spent my whole life digging myself out of this nightmare of a whole called my "family".   Last week I was so depressed I could not get myself to leave the apartment or go to work. On Thursday I finally reached out to a friend (someone that I have been dating) that I trust. Talking with him helped me and I have managed to start moving again.  He is older than me by 10 years, successful, divored with grown children and grandchildren.  He is "eccentric" but very intelligent and kind.  I have what I hope is an irrational fear that he may have sexually molested his daughter.  I have absolutely no basis for this.  In fact he spends a great deal of time staying in his families homes when he is not working.  It is just more bullshit from my families legacy that I have to unravel.  More Later..

       I can see it all now. What I could have been if only I had been supported and loved instead of abused. I am 42 years old and my father is till verbally and emotionally abusing me.  A few weeks ago I fell into a depression after I was having a telephone conversation with my Mother and my father started screaming and swearing at her to get off the phone.  I found out that the whole year my Sister had been here in Vancouver he called her at least once a week.  My father has called me once in 16 years and that was because my Mother made him.  This past Christmas on Christmas Day he raged at me and told me to get the FUCK OUT OF HIS HOUSE… because my dog was barking in excitement along with my sisters dog while we were opening presents.  I will never go back there again.  I am depressed and in mourning for a life I could have had, for the things I could have experienced and achieved if I had grown up without an abusive father. All this pain that I seem to carry with me daily my whole life.  Normal loving supportive families don’t have that.  I have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder because of the trauma I experience as a child.  I lived terrified, terrified for my life. In constant fear year after year. The person that was supposed to be protecting me was continually threatening my life and hurting me.  Here is a list of the abuse that I remember;  I have no memory of my father picking me up and hugging me in anyway at anytime. My father never raged at or hit my sister.  I was the one he single out to hurt and abuse. At about 1.5 years old he put me out in the middle of the yard in a chain link fence held up with stakes.  I was out there all day until it was dark.  I don’t know where my mother was. Another time he put me out on a narrow strip of grass with a one foot decorative picket fence with a 6 foot drop to the sidewalk below, he left me out there for a long time. At about 2.5 years I remember him screaming and swearing at me because I would not put my foot down.  I had cut it very badly in the backyard and had a big bandage on it.  He grabbed me and shook me when I winced when it hurt when I finally did put my foot down. At about 4 years my sister fell off the bunk bed slide while we were playing.  He asked me if it happened accidentally or on purpose.  I had no idea what the words meant and I repeated on purpose.  He spanked the hell out of me and threw me around the room raging in my face. One night I got ready for bed, when I came out of the bathroom.  He screamed at me about brushing my teeth.  He asked my sister if I had brushed my teeth.  She knew I had but she said NO.  He spanked the hell out of me, threw me up the stairs.  I crawled into bed.  I could not stop sobbing.  He would scream from downstairs that if I did not stop making noise he would come upstairs and give me something to cry about.  He came upstairs and choked me… raging in my face to stop crying.  He said he would kill me if I didn’t stop. When I was about 6 years old.  I came home from school. It was noticed that I had lost a mitten.  He raged at me for losing it.  Then he told me to get out of the house and not come home until I found my mitten.  It was winter and pitch black dark.  I could not find the mitten, I spent most of the night in a snow bank… late into the night he came in the car and found me.  He screamed at me to get in the car. I was put to bed without dinner.  Every day he would ask me if I had found my mitten and give me a lecture about losing things. I was always a good kid. Quiet and polite. When we were in family gatherings he would come up behind me and press his thumb into the back of my neck.  It would look like he was resting his had on my shoulder but he was actually hurting me. Learning to ride a bike was a nightmare.  He would scream and yell and swear at me.  My confidence was so erased I would crash into walls and he would be so angry. More concerned about the bike than me.  It got so bad that finally I said I did not want to learn how to ride a bike.  They told me they had taken back the bike and I was so relieved. I didn’t want to go through that again.  One day in the basement I discovered they had hidden it in the rafters.  I don’t remember what happened but I did learn how to ride a bike. I remember he took us to a big field at the school.  Of course he was much kinder to my sister while she learned. I remember being across the field and watching and feeling ostracised.  I used to feel that my mom dad and sister had secret meetings without me.  I always felt on the outside like I did not belong and was not wanted. That is how I still feel today about the whole world.  That I do not belong and that I am not wanted. I remember having my tonsils out and being in the hospital for a week.  I don’t remember my dad ever visiting just my Mom. I wondered if they would leave me there cause I knew my dad did not want me back and would be glad I was not at home. I became a victim.  I got picked on in school…especially when we moved from Trail to Kamloops.  One day they through really hard icy snowballs at me and hit me in the face.  This broke my glasses and I got a black eye.  When I went home and told my dad he was not concerned that someone had hurt me he was raging angry that I would need knew glasses. He said to teach me a lesson I would have to wait a month and wear them with tape on them.  Learning to water ski was a nightmare.  He kept me in the water in the middle of the lake for hours. Screaming and raging at me because I couldn’t get up on skis.  My sister and Mom were crying begging him to let me back in the boat and he wouldn’t.  He just ruined things that could be fun.  Even if we were having fun there was always the underlying threat that he would lose his temper and rage at us. I remember my dad spanking the cat “Jingles” and then throwing him off the balcony one day. It horrified me. I was and I guess still am very talented.  I excelled in track and field, acting, singing and in school in general.  I was never supported or encouraged. In fact my Mom often discouraged me.  My dad never came to a track meet.  At one point I remember my Mom being called in to the school for a meeting with the counsellor.  We were told together that I had an exceptional IQ and that they wanted to put me in more challenging classes. My Mom said No.  Later in the car she said that men don’t like smart women and that you are nothing if you are not loved.  She implied no man would love me if they knew I was smarter than them.  It turns out I have a genius IQ. I was discouraged from doing things I loved like exercising, working out etc.  I was very good in track and field and made it to the BC Finals where I won second. I was asked to train on the BC Team but my Mom said no. I feel that it would have required extra energy and money and that my Dad was all my Mom could handle.  A lot of energy was spent manoeuvring around him. My family had a kind of three day look perfect on the outside limit.  We always looked good on the outside.  Rarely did anyone ever see how my dad terrorized us. So if someone came to visit they would not realize as my Dad would be on his best behaviour.

      I have a varied background. Lead singer/writer for an alt. Rock Band, CBC-TV Journalist, Media Relations/Communications for Fortune 500 companies, on the executive board of a provincial political party (now in power) and finally e-Commerce.  I have benefited from this experience and feel I have a fairly broad view of the world and it's workings. I really do appreciate "artistic types" and I would put you in that category.  However I found it so frustrating that they don't all seem to have a broader view of the world.  Especially it's economic workings, politics and what it takes to make the world go around.  My artistic friends seem to do whatever they can to avoid any kind of long term commitment (especially any kind of corporate job) or understand the difficult nature of international politics.  Most find research on these subjects very droll indeed and tend to skim off the top of satirical comedy and well.... movies like Mr. Moore's.  The whole Moore 911 thing I find infuriating and have taken it upon myself to encourage you to get a bigger picture. This is an excerpt from Christopher Hitchens article.  Probably the most damning and insightful piece on Moore I have read.  "To describe this film as dishonest and demagogic would almost be to promote those terms to the level of respectability. To describe this film as a piece of crap would be to run the risk of a discourse that would never again rise above the excremental. To describe it as an exercise in facile crowd-pleasing would be too obvious. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a sinister exercise in moral frivolity, crudely disguised as an exercise in seriousness. It is also a spectacle of abject political cowardice masking itself as a demonstration of "dissenting" bravery."  This is just a teaser. Hitchens backs himself up very well.  You can find the full article here  urlLink http://www.slate.com/id/2102723   Oh and the whole "Gay" thing... I am a bit impatient.  Can we all get beyond this?  I don't care who you love, just love them.  I read your coming out article and I wondered if part of your guilt wasn't about having sex with men, per say, as it was having had so many seemingly frivolous sexual relationships.  Of course you should be out there meeting and experiencing people... but should you be having sex with all of them?  As I got older and hopefully wiser I realized that knowing someone wasn't just about having sex... it goes so far beyond that. In fact having sex seemed to get in the way of really getting to know someone.  You can have too much of a good thing. Everything in moderation is my motto. I have to admit that I like sex and have gleefully rushed into it.  Later on I also have to admit eewww yuck I had sex with THAT person? I believe in an eventual (go out there and experience people and then settle down) monogamous sexual relationship.  To be able to love someone unconditionally for the rest of their lives is truly "love" whether they are male or female it doesn't really matter.  I am looking forward to watching your show on "meditating".  I have learned to meditate and being able to tap into that source of "infinite intelligence" I think, is they key to all the worlds problems.  Religion in any form I believe is very evil in the end. I find them limiting and controlling.  Their intentions were correct but their means are a bit suspect. Who is anyone to tell me what the exact road to "heaven" is.   I have read books by Steven Covey (where I was able to really get the nature of unconditional love) and many of the "spiritual" authors.  It will be many many decades, possibly centuries before these views are globally adopted but I have great hope that this is the direction we are going.  I can't help but feel that separating church from state is a very good thing and a great start towards a completely peaceful world. For me democracy's best cornerstone is the separating of church and state.  It is very brave of you to put yourself "out there" and encourage feedback.  As they say life is a buffet "take what you like and leave the rest".  All the very best in your life's endeavours.  Cheers, Rachel

      Originally Written September, 2003 A bit of a synopsis of my life from the time I was about 27... a few struggles have been left out... but this is the gist of it. I was finally granted the gift of being free and clear of my debt. This was a rough copy and I did end up sending in a much better version but I can't find it right now. It still hurts at times to read about my life.  I have grown but let's just say that being born into a violent and extremely dysfunctional family has nearly killed me. Quite literally. By not only my so called "father's" hand but my own. An abusive childhood still sneaks up on me and robs me of the joy of life. I am growing but the horrors still manage to present themselves.  I can remember being ten years old and learning about suicide. I was so elated by it. My life at ten was so horrible and when I realized that there was a way out I was so entirely relieved. It helped me cope with the horrors. If it got too bad I didn't have to stay I could leave. I imagined the peace of the "nothingness" of death and it would seem a great relief from the pain I was experiencing. From that day on I have held suicide close by.... "Just in case".   Dear Sarah Berryman,  The following is to inform you of the nature of my financial situation over the past 12 years. To date, during this bankruptcy process nowhere has there been any opportunity for me to formally outline my financial situation and how I came to file bankruptcy. I am an individual and my situation is therefore unique. I insist that this letter become a part of my permanent record and be given to each and every debtor, individual and agency involved in my bankruptcy case.  On Friday, August 25th, 2003 I watched a ½ hour video regarding a couple who are spending too much money on microwave ovens and blenders. They never do come to the crisis of losing their jobs.. A crisis which I have faced at least five times in the past 11 years.  You have just informed me that because I now have a full-time permanent job, the very first full-time permanent job I have ever had in my life, that you will be recommending that I pay another $500.00 for a whole entire year. With all due respect, I have paid and paid dearly over the past 12 years and deserve to be free of the shackles of this burden at the end of the formal 9 month bankruptcy period.. Please read the following information carefully and consider the true spirit of the bankruptcy law in the manner of which it was intended. I have read the Bankruptcy Law, it is there to give individuals a fresh start. I deserve a fresh start.  I came alone to Vancouver to change my life after leaving my common-law husband behind. He had put me in the hospital after beating the hell out of me. Little did I know that I would live very near or below the poverty line for the next 10 years. I graduated from B.C.I.T. in the spring of 1991. It was a two year course it left me with over $7,000.00 in debt. I graduated from the Broadcast Journalism program in the top of my class. At the very same time the federal government decided to lay a total of 5,000 people off from the C.B.C. the largest employer of journalists in Canada. Normally 95% of the class would be hired before the end of their final term. None of my graduating class got jobs. I was competing for 3 month contracts against people who had 10 years experience and I was on social assistance.  I worked for a total of 9 months as a journalist. I have never been able to find work as a journalist or in broadcasting since. I worked sporadic bits and pieces of work as a temporary and finally landed a one year contract with the BC Paraplegic Association. During this year I paid $100.00 a month on my student loan and sincerely thought I would be able to pay it off one day. I remember the creditor scolding me because that amount a month was not even covering the interest. The Provincial government had cancelled the BCPA’s permit to collect monies from the casinos, the program I was working on was cancelled. I was out of work again.  Within a 3 month period I suffered the loss of not only my job but my fiancé and my unborn child. At about the same time the federal government changed the bankruptcy laws and I would not be able to file bankruptcy for 10 years after I had graduated. A financial advisor encouraged me to file bankruptcy before the law came into place. I said no, I want to be responsible and pay my debt. I believed I would find some sort of permanent work and eventually be able to pay it off.  After about a year of paralyzing depression severely aggravated by unemployment and the pressures of this unpaid debt, I finally landed a 6 month contract with CIBC bank. After stretching that out to 9 months the project was cancelled. I lived off of my credit card for a month and half and over drafted an account to pay my rent and eat. This is the $2,000.00 debt I owe, ironically to the CIBC bank.  I eventually found gruelling work selling subscriptions for one year standing outside on the sidewalk of the skyscraper I had previously worked in. After this low paying sales program was cancelled .I worked another low paying sales job. There was no money for a student loan. I had barely enough to get by on. I decided to borrow $3,000.00 on a credit card to start a home based business while I also worked full time. I hoped I could use the profits from this to pay off my student loan. I was attacked by a stranger while walking my dog and was not able to work at my home business as I suffered another bout of depression.. They never caught the man that attacked me. When the company went bankrupt after 10 months I was entitled to some employment insurance.  At that point I had been so unemployed that I was entitled to be retrained and the government put me through a 3 month course to learn digital production and web work. I was on welfare again once that class ended, but did manage to find work at first for two weeks (AeroInfo) and then I was renewed every two weeks for 8 months and was then sent home again as they ran out of money. After being unemployed for another 3 months I was asked back by AeroInfo. They kept me on 3 month contracts for 9 months and then finally hired me full-time with a warning that they thought the job would only last two years. I was finally getting on my feet and bought a car for the first time since I had been living in Vancouver. I needed the car for the job as I was required to use it for work. I had to pay cash as I have no credit. Unfortunately, the job only lasted one year. I remained unemployed for another year fighting another bout of depression. During this time was finally able to file bankruptcy and get the burden of this debt off of my shoulders. A burden that I woke up with every single morning for the past 12 years. I could have filed about 6 months sooner but I was so debilitated by the depression that looking for work was all I could handle. My psychiatrist urged me to file as the burden of this debt was a key factor in my illness.  For the first time in my life I have a full-time permanent job. I hope I pass the probation period at the end of October. I need to be able to save. I am 41 years old with no husband or children. I live alone, all I have is my dog. It is very hard for me to find places to rent with a dog. Many will do a credit check and I have lost many lower rent places because they would not rent to someone with bad credit. I want to move on to be free of this burden to have some money in the bank for emergencies.  I have not gone out and spent money foolishly on vacations, electronics, fancy dinners or clothes. I have never been fired, only laid off. I have been just getting buy at the poverty level for at least 8 of the past 10 years. My tax records will prove this. In the true spirit of the bankruptcy law as it was intended I feel I should finally be set free of this burden and allowed to move on with my life, not in another 12 months, but now. For the sake of my mental, spiritual, physical and financial health I urge you to not sentence me to one more year of waking up to the burden of this debt.
