      My baby sister is turning 30.  We're 8 years apart with 2 brothers in between, so she was just a little kid to me for a long time after she grew up.  But now she has two kids of her own, and she continually impresses me with her drive and skills.  Now I've had a career that I've been developing since right out of college, with the exception of 3 months off when I had my daughter in 1993.  My sister (who was a music teacher) has been home since her second kid was born, but she does the mom/homemaker thing so well!  Her kids are fantastic - she enjoys them - she has a wonderful husband - she is so caring about her family and her in-laws.  But she lives 10 hours away.  I miss her.  I'm listening to a CD of accapella music she recorded with a group in college.  It's making me miss college days, things that might have been, but most of all being able to be close to her, my brother-in-law, my nieces.    I've got to put more effort into it.

      So I am said to be the only Territo sibling without a blog?  Is that a bad thing?  Am I a better or worse adjusted person without feeling the need to talk to people I don't know (or worse, do know) on the internet?  How long do you think it will take for me to really piss someone off by sharing my viewpoint in this impersonal forum that gives you the false sense of security that you are not really talking to anyone when in truth you are talking to EVERYONE!!!  I won't be left out...I'll blog if I must...but it is up to you all to find my blog...don't think I am going to be sending it right to you nosey people...  Do you think I am getting the hang of it?

      I've discovered, that once uncovered, I do not care to blog.&nbsp; I'll leave you with this quote from  The Blind Assassin , by Margaret Atwood:  "The only way you can write the truth is to assume that what you set down will never be read.&nbsp; Not by any other person, and not even by yourself at some later date.&nbsp; Otherwise you begin excusing yourself.&nbsp; You must see the writing as emerging like a long scroll of ink from the index finger of your right hand;&nbsp; you must see your left hand erasing it.&nbsp; Impossible, of course."  So, if you wonder what's going on with me in the future, just call and ask.

      As I drove to WORK on this beautiful Saturday, Paterson (where my office building is) looked, well, different.  During the winter, when I arrive and leave in the dark, the neighborhood has a dingy look - depressing, deprived, scary even?  Now that it is summer I see it in a different light - not exactly where I would want to live, but beautiful in its own way.  This morning the air was cool and fresh, the sunshine sparkling across the farmer's market by the railroad tracks, turning the fruits and vegetables into colorful gems.  Those working at the stands looked happy, bright, and ready for the day ahead.  The customers were beginning to build, everyone looking excited at the prospect of shopping beautiful produce for an equally beautiful 3 day holiday weekend.   Enjoy!

      Two nights ago flipping around the channels when I outght to have been sleeping I ran across the movie "Trainspotting" - the sex, drugs, rock and roll movie about a group of young adults in Scotland that go in and out of heroin addictions.  Now I generally do have a taste for the macabre, but this movie has some pretty GROSS scenes and not much great drama in between (although the music is good!)- BUT I COULDN'T STOP WATCHING IT!  I had to see the scene where they wake out of drug stuppors to find the baby (her name was Dawn), dead from neglect and decomposing in her crib.  Why do I find that so compelling?  Is it wrong to be drawn to the horrific?  Compounding my thoughts in this area is the release of Joel Steinberg, the crazy druggie lawyer who was sent away for the death of his adopted daughter Lisa.  His lover Hedda Nussbaum got off without any jail time as she testified against him and had also been the victim of his abuse.  I recall reading about the case, watching the trial on TV and reading a book or two when this was all occuring back in the late 80's.  And it has always stayed with me, so vividly, the horrors of a sordid apartment, the physical and mental torture of Hedda, Lisa and a baby brother who survived.  Apparently I am not alone in this strange fixation, as a web search last night revealed websites protesting his release, criminal case studies, and current news articles and posts speculating that he will not survive for long out in the NYC population.  Personally I would not be at ALL surprised if he turns up dead within the month.  So back to my question - does my appetite for knowledge of gruesome horrors indicate a sick attraction?  Does it mean I have strange thoughts and tendencies in my subconscious?  Or does the horror stay with me as a reminder of how GOOD my life is, myself and my loved ones out of harm.  Does it just make me feel more normal?
