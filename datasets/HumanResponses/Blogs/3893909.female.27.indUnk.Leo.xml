       Not long after I crawled into bed the other night, Ethan came in and crawled in next to me.&nbsp; I was under the covers he was on top for all of you perverts.&nbsp; We talked about our friendship, how long we have been friends, and how much the three of us rely on each other.&nbsp; It was just nice, he was running his hand through my hair the way he always does when something is really weighing on his shoulder.&nbsp; Then the conversation diverted.... &nbsp; Ethan started talking about how&nbsp;our friendship will change as we get older.&nbsp; His biggest argument being that JAKE &amp; I should consider taking our relationship to the next level regardless of the friendship.&nbsp; His rationale behind this is that if any of us ever do get in a committed relationship the friendship will begin to fall apart and we will spend less and less time together.&nbsp; If JAKE &amp; I make a serious relationship out of what we already have then at least that friendship will be kept in tact.&nbsp; This of course made me cry.&nbsp; I hate it when he talks about the end of the friendship between the 3 of us.&nbsp; It is like thinking about death.&nbsp; No one wants to die, no one really knows what it feels like when it happens, and everybody hurts.&nbsp;  &nbsp; The BOOTLEG BAND has six members ETHAN, JAKE and myself along with 3 more of our friends KURT, MATT, and DAMON.&nbsp; Being in a band has never been easy on the friendship between the six of us so this feeling of loss is nothing new to me.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I am now convinced that I have misread ETHAN's feelings for me&nbsp;so after some thought I told him that I would think about it. &nbsp; Then he proceeded to tell me that he would not be going to MEXICO with us.&nbsp; He said that JAKE already knew that he would not be going, but I should let JAKE know if I am still going to go.&nbsp; I told him that I was still going, but it would not be the same without him. &nbsp; So I was crying like a baby at this point... JAKE stayed and held me most of the night.&nbsp; When he left the next morning, I stayed in bed and cried some more.&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;

       A good portion of SHADY CREEK runs through my land.  Many years back, JAKE, ETHAN and I asked my parents if we could use an old tire and some rope to make a rope swing down by the creek.  We have spent a lot of time back there... fishing, swimming, laughing. When my parents were killed in a tragic motorcycle accident a few years back, that swing became a place where I could go to have a good cry all by myself.  JAKE and ETHAN have never let me cry by myself.  They have always given me a friendly shoulder to cry on.  Today is the 6 year anniversary of their death and I had a rough day.  JAKE & ETHAN were over at the crack of dawn to make me breakfast.  We spent most of the day back on the tire swing reminiscing about the good ole days.  They do their best to keep my mind off my parents but the truth is... I really miss them and there are days when I just do not want to get out of bed.  That is why JAKE & ETHAN suggested we do the morning run thing.  I would always have a good reason to get out of bed in the morning.  They are my life lines and I could never repay them for their friendship.  It's late and I promised JAKE I would give him a call later.  ETHAN is sleeping in one of the extra bedrooms so I don't have to be alone tonight.  GOOD NIGHT.

       I went running with JAKE today.  Every morning JAKE, ETHAN, & I go for a 6 Mile run cross country.  ETHAN couldn't make it today because he had a Dr. Appt that he couldn't miss.  We usually take the same route everyday, but today JAKE thought it would be fun to take a shortcut through FARMER LARRY's sheep & goat pasture for a little MUTTIN BUSTIN(this is where you ride the sheep around the pasture-person who gets the farthest wins).  WHY NOT I thought?  Now if you know anything about sheep farming, you will know that these farmers generally keep llama's in with the sheep.  And again you may ask why would they do that?  Well forget what you've seen on PUBLIC TELEVISION...llama's are very territorial and aggressive animals.  Generally these animals are put in the pastures to keep wolves and coyotes out-not weirdo's like JAKE just out to have a good time.  Well I could see that llama did not take a liking to JAKE from the get go.  She started showing her teeth and spitting at him and well...she sounded a little like a heifer in heat.  But JAKE just kept on a going and finally he found a sheep that would get close enough for him to hop on.  Unfortunately, the sheep could not run as fast as the llama with all that extra weight.  Would't you know it the llama caught up with JAKE and bit him right in the hinder.  Now he has what appears to be a large pair of purple lips on his butt.  This one is going to be hard for him to explain and I am hoping that he just doesn't go there---we will keep this a secret.  Running has been a tremendous stress reliever for us lately.  We are working out several new songs so we are ready for SHADY CREEK's annual festival.  It's a big deal for this little town.  They block off the street's.  People put up tent's out at the airport.  The whole town goes crazy for the entire weekend.  I feel a little mixed up after today.  JAKE always makes me laugh.  I can be having the worst day of my entire life and JAKE will go and do something like jump in FARMER LARRY's sheep pasture.  JAKE is fearless and anyone who loves him will love him for who he is because there ain't no other way.  There were several times during our run today that I wanted to just get it out there in the open so that we can at least talk about it, but...the moment just passed me by.  I really did not want to betray the trust that JAKE has for ETHAN.    ETHAN stopped by tonight.  He was just not himself and I couldn't probe him enough to see what was wrong.  He just said "Everything was fine."  He can say that, but I am calling his bluff.  Maybe tomorrow he'll be back to himself.  Got a lot of SONGS to get through tomorrow-so better get to bed early.

       This will begin the story of my journey.  I play guitar for THE BOOTLEG BAND.  We are a barn band that was created about 5 years ago when my friends Ethan and Jake thought..... IT WOULD BE SO COOL TO BE IN A BAND.  Well, they were right, it is really cool and along the way we picked up a few more band members.  Now we are the house band for THE SMOKING GUN TAVERN & OASIS.   The three of us have been best friends since we were 7.  In some crazy way we are almost like triplets-we can read each others minds and that is scary.  We have no secrets and no regrets.  Life has dealt us a good hand in that we will always have each other.  I am certain that when we are 92 we will be in the same nursing home and I will be able to count on them to tell me the truth when I ask them "Does this Moo Moo make me look fat?"  I have a lot of great memories at THE SMOKING GUN-all of which include ETHAN & JAKE.  Tonight was no exception.  As we were doing our final song of the night-I LIKE IT-I LOVE IT-I WANT SOME MORE OF IT-a fight broke out between 2 cowboys in the audience.  It was insane-for cowboys anyway.  I have seen some good cowboy fights in my day, but this one was like 2 little boys fighting over a soccer ball at recess.  Anyway, I got hit by a little debris (a flying beer bottle-I had to get 7 stitches-bummer-I hope it don't leave a mark)and ETHAN just lost it.  He through down his guitar and FLEW off the stage-unfortunately this was about the same time that the police arrived so after I got my stitches JAKE and I had to go bail him out of jail.  HOW DOES LIFE GET SO CRAZY ONE MIGHT ASK?  Well, the fact is that the THREE of us are best friends and as I said we have no secrets...or so I thought.  ETHAN and I were instant messaging today.  If there is anything you need to know about ETHAN it is that HE CANNOT KEEP A SECRET TO SAVE HIS SOUL.  ETHAN said that JAKE is falling apart because he has feelings for me.  Now one might think what could be so bad about this-the way I see it the 3 of us are common law married by the laws of Wisconsin anyway.  This does however pose a problem.... I have secretly been in love with ETHAN for the past 2 years and I do not see my heart changing its mind anytime soon.  Either way someone will get hurt, plus the friendship will be damaged.  So for now, we will just bide our time very quietly because the FRIENDSHIP is worth so much more than anything else I have right now. And patiently I am waiting for some sort of DIVINE INTERVENTION.
