Yesterday I stayed the night at Jordan's and today we made some sorta chocolate things. It was fun. Lately I havent been doing much just hanging out. I am saving up my money in a box in my room i roll it up in a rubberband thingy. so far I have $61 and in about a week i will have $101 even though I should have $121 in about a week because i didnt get half of my allowance a little bit back. but thats ok I am sure I will. But anyways.... I am going to save it up and probably go shopping with Crissy or someone. I got a lot of new cloths over the summer so far. Well I am going to go now. C YA EVERYONE!

        Song:   Nothing right now     Quote:   Stupid Mother Fuddrucker!!     Feeling:   Happy   and yet   sad       Well today was this thing at youth where we were supposed to go to FunSpot and then to eat and then to a movie but we ended up going to FunSpot and eat at festival bay and hang out a little bit and then rent a movie and watch it at Dwight's house. Nikki came with me cause Crissy sorta ditched me but let's not get into that everything is fine again. So no need to fret. Me and Nikki left early before the movie because it was all highschoolers and I thought it was best if us middle schoolers left and stuff so they wouldn't get annoyed and have like their own little high schooler group thing going on. I hate going to youth with out Crissy or Raeanne because then I feel left out around the highschoolers even if I have someone else there like Nikki but Nikki is no fun...she is fun to hang out with at school but longer then that she gets really really annoying. I wish becky could have come. That would have been fun. This is reason I am said is just.....I don't know it's hard to explain and I don't feel like putting it in this because then everyone will know who I like and so will he and it wouldn't be good but if you really want to know you can ask me and I will tell you depending on who it is...well anyways I'm done so maybe tomorrow I will have more boring stuff to write about. C YA!       *+*Ari*+*
