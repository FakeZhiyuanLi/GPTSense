        LOVE starts with a SMILE, grows with a KISS, and ends with a TEAR. DON'T cry over anyone who won't cry over you. Good FRIENDS are hard to find, harder to leave, and impossible to forget. You can only go as far as you push.  ACTIONS speak louder than words. The HARDEST thing to do is watch the one you love, love somebody else.    DON'T let the past hold you back, you're missing the good stuff. LIFE'S SHORT. If you don't look around once in a  while you might miss it. A BEST FRIEND is like a four leaf clover, HARD TO FIND and LUCKY TO HAVE.    Some people make the world SPECIAL just by being in it.   BEST FRIENDS are the siblings God forgot to give us. When it HURTS  to look back, and you're SCARED to look ahead, you can look beside you and your BEST FRIEND will be there.     TRUE FRIENDSHIP "NEVER" ENDS. Friends are FOREVER. Good friends are like STARS. You don't always see them, but you know they are ALWAYS THERE.    DON'T  frown. You never know who is falling in love with your smile. What do you do when the only person who can make you stop crying is the person who made you cry?  Nobody is perfect until you fall in love with them.      Everything is okay in the end. If it's not okay, then it's not the end. Most people walk in and out of your life, but only FRIENDS leave footprints in your heart.    "I believe that friends are quiet angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have trouble remembering how to fly."

      One of the things that make us happy is when we love and we are loved. Life is a continuing effort of loving others and experiencing love in return for love always seeks expression. Yet when the person who is loved does not return the love that we express, when our love is unrequited, our love sometimes turns to hatred… We need to know what love really is in order to understand and truly love others. By doing so, we may heal ourselves and continue loving for it is by loving others that we find meaning and purpose in life. It has been said that no man is an island. We all love in order to have a reason to live… The first lesson is that you must know the ultimate thing that everyone seeks… love? no! not love but happiness.. So, if you want him to come back to you, you must have happiness within and he will come back for she will be seeking that which is within you- happiness… You must know that happiness is found not outside of you but within you... Try to detach yourself from your emotions. Remember always that the greatest love of all is to love yourself first for you cannot love others when you do not have it. Otherwise you will be just using the other person to make you happy. This is how we heal our heart. We use our mind to heal our heart… The next time you fall in love, know that you’ve nothing to prove to the one you love. There is only everything to express for love means that the love that we give to others is what we surely receive. We do not expect or demand others to give it back to us. Love is not blind. Love sees every shade and color of the light. When someone we love does something wrong to us, we should correct it in a constructive manner without anger or hatred and without the feeling that we are better than the other but because we know that it is the right thing to do. Love is about something, we give and express love to others simply because we want love in return. We want the other person to express love in a way that pleases us and makes us feel good... So, what should we do to truly love others? Let it begin within... love begins within ourselves. When we love others, we must be willing to set them free if and when they so desire. No one belongs to anyone. Each man has his own personal path to follow and a destiny to fulfill. We may be with each other for a short or a long while but in the end, we will leave everybody behind and move on our spiritual journey. What matters most is the experience of loving. Our life is simply the announcement that there is love in our hearts. This is the same reason why love eludes us when we seek it because we are absolutely sure we do not have it. We attract only that which we have and what we have is what we are. We attract every person that is in our life through our consciousness. What we are and we have within is what we will attract… so, if you want to attract a handsome, honest, and intelligent person, first you have to be the ideal that you desire to have and you will attract the kind of love that you are. To love others is not to use them when we are sad, lonely or depressed or when we are having a problem. To love others is to love them by being with them without demands and no expectations. When others do not return our love and goodness, let us not feel bad. Its spiritual purpose is for us to know how it feels and we will never ever do it to another. Just give without expecting something from someone and just let the universe return the love that we give… let us therefore stop seeking love for love is everywhere. Just a motto I want to add: Dance as if nobody’s watching. Sing as if no one is listening. And love as if you have never been hurt before…

      we had our 1st day last june 1.. medyo advance kesa sa ibang schools kya medyo may hang-over pa ng summer vacation... being a transferee is really hard, i knew that before i decided to transfer pero hindi ko inexpect na ganito pla ka-hard! new school, new environment, new people and new friends.. hirap mag-adjust... i miss my old school and my old chums.. sobra! pero am still hoping na i will gain more friends... kaya sa mga ibang transferee jan tulad ko, don't worry.. "u'r not alone!" kaya natin 'to! ;)

      all my life, i've dreamed and really wished to have a younger brother or sister.. being the youngest and the only girl in the fam makes me feel "sabik" sa mga bata.. parang nabu2hay ung "ate instinct" within me.. pero dahil nga cguro my mom can't have children anymore (after me...), parang nag-give up n ko sa pangarap ko na yun lalo na after my mom died months ago... but one unexpected night, while i was in my room, my dad came up to me and opened the topic na ayokong pinag-uusapan.. parang nakakapaso! then he asked me kung bakit ayaw ko cyang magpakasal ulit.. (dinaan pa s joke! argh!) pero d k cnagot.. hanggang napunta sa tanong na, pano kung may kapatid daw ako.. i WASN"T shocked with dat, kumbaga being a 17 yr old teenager (am turning 18 on october) i think i was matured enuf to handle thos kinds of issues...(kung issue b ang tawag dun?) ok lng nman eh.. wla nmang ksalanan ung bata sagot ko pa! un pala, TOTOO! as in a have a 4 yr old brother.. pinakita p ung pics nya.. (s celfon nga lng) kamukha ko at ng kuya ko.. hindi pwdeng itanggi n kapatid nga nmin.. cguro nga, wla ng magagawa p kundi tanggapin n lng cya.. kapatid naman nmin un eh.. ung nga lng, half pro kapatid p rin.. dun ko narealize n un ang tnatawag n "BLESSING in DISGUISE".. a granted wish dat i never expected to happen...

      after 6 weeks in a new environment, new school and with new people, i realized that being as transferee is not bad after all... in fact, mas madali nga ng ganito kaysa nung nasa old school p ko kasi at least ngayon di ko kailangan problemahin ang mga d n dpat iniicip... kata2pos lng ng prelims nmin and i feel sooooo satisfied with my grades! whenever i pass by the office nga eh see those DL's names, im hoping na sana next sem nandun rin ang name ko... but i guess, tama ung cnasabi ng iba, "you can't always have d best of both worlds." am doing great sa school, pero sa haus medyo hindi.. masydo kong nappressure dhil sa sobrang expectations ng mga tao sa bahay pero "CARRY" pa rin.. kailangan kasi kayanin eh..
