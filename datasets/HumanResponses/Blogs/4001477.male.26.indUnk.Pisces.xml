						   that's a name i use online sometimes and it just popped in my head a minute ago and made me chuckle. so anyway, went to see my buddy Kryss at her lil' kids theater production last night, and i must say it was not what i expected. although something must be said for when you leave a show like that and feel a little creeped out. maybe it was the kids, maybe it's that lil' miss muffit was a hottie or maybe it was seeing a black man in tight pants was more than my mind could comprehend. more than likely, i was just a bit nervous to see kryss again...not having seen her in 2 years. in any event, the meeting went off without a hitch and leaves the possibility for meeting again in the very near future. and i guess that's all i can ask for. i ate way too much mexican food last night and topped it off laying in front of the TV nursing my swollen stomach and weary head. also talked to my sister last night on the phone. it's odd. we still have fun as though she were standing right next to me...even though she is 850 miles away. i hope that lasts. now, there's no point in me wasting a perfectly good morning on the PC, so i'm off.....er, to probably do nothing at all.  ...the big, good wolf.

						   just love the days when i have to get up early for a training and then go home, only to return to work again later in the day.&nbsp; actually i don't mind it all that much...so i'm really not being sarcastic.&nbsp; i guess i don't have much to say other than i still don't understand why i am "blogging" and what it is this is actually supposed to be doing for me.&nbsp; if you have any ideas, feel free to let me know.

						    This would be my first entry.&nbsp; At this point, having just woken up...i don't have a vast amount of enlightening things to say.&nbsp; So i'll leave it at THIS IS ONLY A TEST ...and who knows if i'll even remember to come back and update this thing...or even care.

						    urlLink    I'm probably over-reacting but i expect nothing less than a perfect evening on October 30th, when i will be seeing Type O Negative in Milwaukee.  Halloween show, you say?  oy vey!  and just announced...TON in Chicago on Halloween!!  very much looking forward to this october.  it's set up to be nothing short of exhilirating.  i know i'm a nerd when it comes to these things... but that's what people say they love about me.  well, not really.  but i like to think they say that.  Happy Halloween in August...

						   got tomorrow off and i frickin need it!  don't feel too much like talking about work so i wonder what i could talk about instead?  i know...  how unusually cool the weather has been lately...are they cancelling summer early this year?  not that i really mind...i can't wait for the fall!  it's so damn exciting that time of year.  though i wonder how i will spend it this year...seeing as i won't be going to corn mazes and pumpkin farms really all that much this year.  unless i can convince my buddies to enjoy it as much as i do.  it's unlikely.  although i plan to spend sometime in NYC with my sis, the big city halloween will be different than i'm used to.  i wish i could just have the whole autumn off work so i could enjoy it completely.  take in some traveling and spend time in search of the ever elusive "moment" that usually happens once that time of year.  blame it on too many movies, but one of these days i'll come upon a wooded area...surrounded by a dense mist..with a small overgrown path leading to an old graveyard.  the only light to guide my way is a yellow moon casting an eerie glow upon my surroundings.  shadows seem to move with me and my ears are filled with the sound of my own, heavily beating heart.  but i only fear that this place is all but too unreal and i am searching for something.  something...sweet and soft.  my pale goddess awaits me there.  she has bewitched me... she cast a spell unto which i can not be released but for her flesh.  ....and, so forth...  again, too many movies and bad music, but it keeps me coming back every year.  i will find that place...and she will be there.

						   got one today at work.  apparently i suck at most things.  i don't want this new position!   i remember when i used to have fun at work.  when did that all change? luckily i might have an ace up my sleeve.  an old friend offered me a position at his store.  i'm giving it some serious though.  and that's all i can say for now.  also, all the work i did for WHUT's CD,  apparently was in vain.  it will not make it onto the CD in time for the Machine Head show.  i guess it doesn't really matter anyhow.  just though it'd be exciting.  i remember excitment....
