      I've got waaaaaaaaaaaay too much time on my hands. It's the longest summer break I'll ever have, and on only day two I'm bored. Thought that's probably the fault of these things-  1) Rain, insecent rain!!!!! 2) two huge bruises on my thighs, a nailed wrist and two twatted elbows. Cool bandages though. 3) The fact that everyone appears to have vanished. Hello?  So, I've decided to make this. It's for when things actually kick off. And they will- this summer I've got loads of stuff planned. On the summer soltice I'm off on an uber bike ride from sun up to sun down. Thing is, my other bike mates are either in school, at work or they've got the food tech exam. I'm just praying for good weather- according to the BBC sun up is at 4:36, so I've got to wake up at 4 o'clock. Sun down is twenty to ten. And it's lighting storms. WOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOO! I don't give a toss- I'm doing it anyhow.  The weekend before that it's the southern area championships for our class of boat. Mmmmmmmm needless 5-6 hour drive burning 122kg of carbon dioxide. To put things into perspective, walking for 6 hours burns only 300 grams. But what dad wants, we must do.   Then there's the olympics to watch (sailing and mountain biking only for me), two weeks in Greece ourselves, the national sailing championships (where I'll get 1st junior even if it kills me), my birthday the day after that, then 4 days in the lakes with Oli and Will, home on the results day. Then it's back to the grinder at college.  It's going to be mint, and even if it hoons it down all holiday, I'm going to make it mint.

      This Weekend Thanks To- Big fat waves, surfing, sunshine, rainbows dancing in the waves, talent  No thanks to- Big fat waves, rain, falling in, crap rudder fittings, huge southern prices  Quote of the weekend- Bloomin' 'Eck  OK, I know you're not all sailors, so I won't bore you to fuck with technical stuff.  Getting dragged out of bed at 5am (FIVE FUCKING AM!!!) by an angry father is never a good start to the day. Off and out by 7, my dad angrier than ever, and onto the motorway.  Why do so many people walk their dogs at such unsociable hours? Why are they not in bed?  Anyhow, after enduring 6 traffic jams (howl!) and getting stuck behind just about every slow driver in Kent and Sussex, we arrived at Bexhill-on-Sea (the name says it all).   It's howling a gail, and the sea's rougher than a Barnsley lass. Oh dear.  Throw the boat together (we're late), get out and sail. We survive (just) the huge 6 foot waves, I get soaked through and we finish 5th. Out of only 13.  The evening livened up when we went to the club and joined int eh getting drunk. I wandered round the town (my god, there is a lot of talent on the streets of Bexhill- and some sail!) for a while, and then we headed back to the tent.   The 2nd day was windier, wetter nd it rained for a bit. We were doing ace- and then the rudder fell off! After that we capsized, and so we gave in on that race. The 2nd race of the day resulted in me nearly getting knocked out, and two capsizes which really knocked the energy out of me. But it was fun. We came 9th overall.  The drive home, well, the less about that the better- 2 hours in a traffic jam...

But what dad wants, we must do. It's looking wet with no wind, and I'm wrecked as it is.  Then there's the olympics to watch (sailing and mountain biking only for me), two weeks in Greece ourselves, the national sailing championships (where I'll get 1st junior even if it kills me), my birthday the day after that, then 4 days in the lakes with Oli and Will, home on the results day.
