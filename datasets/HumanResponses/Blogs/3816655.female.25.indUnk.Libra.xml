      All of you know just how close I am to my sister, so can you imagine just how close I feel to the most special part of her - Tailah Xenoi.  I feel it necessary here to tell you just how special Ms. Tai is. She was born in a rush last Thursday (3 months & change before her due date. Because of the determination and strength of her Mother and Grandmother they did all they could to keep her from harm. Her grandmother stood by her daughter making sure that she was clothed properly to keep Tai from escaping too early and he mother (the Fabulous Charleen) walked to the ambulance between contractions - no pain medication - and got her and her baby safely to the ambulance.   From there things took extraordinary turns. As soon as Tai - momma got to the ambulance, Tai came into the world. Thank god for the back up EMT crew who was more experienced. They cut Chars clothes off and found that Ms. Tailah was already here. She was blue with a little heart beat - it looked bleak - But the hand of Jesus was right there with my family. After not to long, they were able to find a heartbeat and get oxygen into her lungs and she has breathing since.   There is nothing left in be but admiration for my mother and sister, love for Tailah, and most importantly a love and devotion for the lord that no one can take away. The devil may try, but I promise he will NOT succeed. I hope that you all can share the same faith, but if not, don't worry if you stand still and let time catch up to you - you will not be able to miss the blessings of God. Don’t look for the big things, but pay attention to the small. That laugh, when you feel like crying; that painless moment; that accomplishment of breathing your first breath. These are the things that are important - Tai almost didn’t live to see it but she got her first blessing the moment she was conceived to my sister - My hero and so far, her blessings have not stopped. The devil will try to sway her, but God and I will be there to protect her.   I love God, I love my Family, I love Tai, and I love all of you who love us.  Thanks Carlie
