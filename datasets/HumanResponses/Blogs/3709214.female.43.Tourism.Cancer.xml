      Don't you just hate it when you expect a certain response out of someone and you don't get it.  Or if you're expecting them to help you accomplish a task and the help isn't there?  I thought if I emailed R and told him that I needed to talk to him, that I was bothered by something that he'd immediately help me.  Maybe ask what was wrong and coax the right words out of me... that isn't happening.  So now I'm sitting here trying to decide if I want to put the whole thing off....bury it and carry on.  Except I know that it won't stay buried...it will lie inside my mind until it is resolved.  Fuck...why can't everything be black and white?  I'm off to feed the kids and get our plans ironed out for the evening.  x

      I spent Saturday evening and night with R.  We went out to dinner, then stopped in at this kewl little bar called Laide.  I was quite impressed with it.  Afterwards we went back to his place....  I lose all sense of understanding what happened next  When R & I made plans for this night the general gist of the conversation was that we hadn't been together in a while (he's in TO, I'm in the far North - 2 hours away).  He's a Dom.  I like him a lot but don't always understand him.  I'm working on communicating with him a little more.  He gets quite frustrated with me at times because I tend to make assumptions rather than ask outright if I'm misunderstanding him.  Anyway... back to Saturday.  We got back to his place and sat talking for a bit.  I'd bought a new book that afternoon and wanted to read the first page.  He sat in his chair and read his book.  I ended up reading the whole first short story (about 20 minutes) and passed the book to him to read.  It was a book on BDSM.  We talked a bit more then he went and lay on the bed.    At this point I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do.  I couldn't get up the courage to ask what he wanted.  I honestly don't think he understands that if I'm unsure about what do to, I'll just do nothing at all.  So I continued to sit in the chair and make small talk with him.    At some point he tossed me this latex tape stuff that I like to play with (just cuz it's kewl).  I tossed it back to him, and joined him on the bed.  He read his book for a bit, showed me his new riding crop, tested it on my leg, then turned out the lights and settled in for the night.    I asked him then if I had done something wrong.  (What I had meant to ask was if I had or hadn't done something that was expected of me.. but I couldn't get those words out).  He said no...that he was tired and going to sleep.    This devastated me.  I didn't then and I still don't know if it was some point that he was trying to get across of if he truly was tired.  I just lay there quietly and tried not to let him know that tears were rolling down my face.  He never once touched me, or kissed me or hugged me or anything.    I must have layed there for a couple of hours before I was calm enough to sleep.  Woke up around 6.  I'm not sure he was awake or not but as he was moving around I ran my fingers down his back.  He asked what I was doing... I replied "trying to give you goosebumps" to which he replies ...well it's making me itchy.  I took that as a hint to stop...  We got up a while later, he had some things he needed to prepare for a party that afternoon.  I lay in bed and watched him.  He made breakfast then said he was going in the shower.    I joined him there .. and we played for a bit, but it wasn't the same.  I couldn't get past this feeling that I'd done something wrong.  Then it was time for me to leave... once again...no hug...nothing.   This has been playing in my mind all day now.  I keep going over what I should've said and done but couldn't.  I want to talk to him about it, but can't.  I don't know how to get the words out.   I don't know if  this uncertainty comes from being disappointed that the night didn't go the way that I'd imagined it would or due to the fact that deep down I know that this is it.  That me being me..I can't be what he wants me to be and I've disappointed him.  Why can't I talk to him about this.  Why am I always so uncomfortable around him that I end up making small talk and sounding like a blithering idiot?  Wtf is wrong with me?  Several times today I've thought of picking up the phone and talking to him, but I always hold back.  I'm afraid that I'll screw things up even more that I imagine they already are.  I know that communication is a vital part of any D/s relationship and I want to communicate..I really do, but I can't.  grrrrrrrrrrr  hmmm..this isn't helping...now I feel worse than I did when I started this blog  time for bed...maybe I'll look at this in a new light tomorrow.  x

      Everyone in my life fits into a certain box...well almost everyone.  I have my friends, my family, my children, etc...It's easier for me this way.  Except for with my children I don't like forming strong emotional attachments to anyone.  In fact, if I feel that this may be happening I walk away.  No apologies or explanations... it's something that I let be known up front.  It's the way that I am...it's me.  Then I have some that won't stay in the box that I originally put them into and some that a box just can't seem to define.  It's for this purpose that I'm starting this blog.    Things get so complicated sometimes that maybe writing them down will help to sort out my thoughts.  Me:  I don't know if there is any one person that can describe all of me.  I'm different to and with different people.  I tend to change into what I think the person I'm with wants me to be.  I'm a swinger... a submissive... a mother... a frigid bitch... an innocent... a slut... take your pick.  I'm me.   M&M, J&C, R&R(&J), M&K are my swinging friends. R, M of M&K, D are my BDSM friends  I've never really had people that crossed the boundaries from one box to the other until I met M&K.  They were supposed to be me BDSM friends... but we've sort of moved past that.  K is no longer interest in that side of things and M pretty much just wants to get fucked.  I love K and like that she's sort of pretty well set into my Girlfriends box.  M on the other hand causes me grief.  I don't know where to put him.    R is even harder to define.  I think a good deal of my blog will be taken up in sorting out my feelings with regards to him.  He challenges me, and annoys me, and angers me and teaches me so much about myself.  Somedays I totally convince myself that I won't have anymore to do with him...and other days it just seems so natural to email him with some little tidbit that I've learned or with a question that I have.  I don't like that.
