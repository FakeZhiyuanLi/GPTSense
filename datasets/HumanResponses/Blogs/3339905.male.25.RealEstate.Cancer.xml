           We all knew the recent beheading of American contractor Nick Berg. Militant Islamist group Muntada al-Ansar allegedly broadcast a video with the opening title of "Abu Musa'b al-Zarqawi slaughters an American" which shows Berg being decapitated. Both al-Zarqawi and Muntada al-Ansar are associated with the Al-Qaida movement. These lead to a public outcry among some Americans.  But first, I've always believed there is a reason for everything that happened. Is this what we called an eye for an eye over the humiliation of prisoners over in Abu Gahrib prison in Iraq? The Iraqis were forced by the US military police to perform certain inhuman acts..and how inhuman could this acts be when they were forced to pile up in pyramid naked, masturbate in front of their captors, being hooded up Ku Klux Klan style and not to mention the beatings that they had endured.  Is there such a need to treat these prisioners? Something must had gone wrong terribly with the administration down the line. Being a national serviceman in my country, I was taught about the Geneva Convention during my first few lessons of the Basic Military Training. 7 years had passed and till now I can still clearly remember that in an event of a war, any captives will have to be interrogated in a human way. (which includes proper food, drink, rest etc..) If you are captured as a soldier, your duty is to only reveal your name, nationality and IC no., that's all.   All these made me contradicted..you know, religious wise. As the song "Where Is The Love" lyrics said..."Do you practice what you preach?" whereby Americans had so much faith in god and their teachings are always to be about love. However on the hindside people all over are starting to have the misconception that Muslims are extremists who are just a group of trouble makers using Allah as a reason to start war..  So if the captors do practice what they preach, won't they feel the slightest of guilt when they humiliate the Iraqis?   It's a like being slapped by one of your friends in the public. Won't it be natural that you retaliate by throwing him a punch as well?

      Funny how one only realise how much or little time they had until certain scenerios pop up. For example, right now I'm doing the practice questions for my Statistics exam, I've realise there's aplenty to cover and working backwards, there might not be enough time till Zero-Hour. Why do people take time for granted? Why can't I start the revisions earlier? Right now I have 24 x 2 dys - 10 (sleep) = 38 hrs excluding the time I take to eat, bath and pass motion etc....with 3 more chapters left untouched...I'm going back.

      Well, usually only when I've reached extreme boredom, will I think about starting a blog..guess this time it might have really hit me hard. My 4th paper which is about Statistics is gonna take place on next Monday. Hell! I can swear this is definitely by far the most difficult one. Coz it's all about Mathes, which means there's really nothing I can do if I don't apprehend it..but come to think about it...if I really do pass this paper, I'm left with only 2 to go! So do or die I must endure and hang on..-'Endure' is a word which I've came to understand only during my army days..never to expect to use it again but under completely another sort of environment..

      Woohoo...I've got a C for my stats exam, not a great deal to some but considering that only 6 passed out of a class of 21, think I deserved a pat on my back.   Guess self-acheivement is a feeling which money can't buy and words can't really decribe but only when you acheive it do you really feel it.
