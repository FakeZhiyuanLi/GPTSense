       My name is Travis. I am the youngest son of Dwight(57) & Becky(53). I was born on June the 18th, 1987 at 11:01AM in Birmingham, Al. at St. Jude's Hospital. I have an older Half brother, Scott, and an older sister, Michelle. I didn't ask to be born into such a bizzare circumstance, but I had no say in the matter. You see, my family is, well, for lack of better wording, crazy. Yes, however, even amongst the chaos, there is an eye to the storm. This is where I come in. Let me just give you a rundown on the situation. I'll call my Paternal Family "The P's" & my Maternal side "The M's" to keep the guilty innocent and vice versa.  The P's   The P's are the steriotypical southern family of the 1940's. Hardworking, easy going, farmers. My Grandfater C.B. & my Grandma Maxie had my Father & his older brother Wayne. They divorced shortly after my father's birth though. My Dad & uncle grew up with their 6 uncles like brothers instead of figures of authority. Such was life on a Moulton Farm. Disputes were settled with shotguns & the biggest worries were the fields. My Grandma was later married to another man by the name of Frank & they had a daughter named Martha. My Dad & uncle always liked to pick on her. They'd draw in her coloring books & make the pictures ugly & thump her on the head & give her a hard time in general. Frank passed away when he was 47. However my Grandmother married again, several years later, this time to a man named Charles.  The P's are very conservative. They like Alabama Football & family get togethers. There are a good deal of skeletons in the closet, which makes for very interesting conversation on Sunday evenings.   The M's   Dear Lord. The M's are nothing short of insane. Most of them are hilarious/hazardous/heavy drinkers or all three. Such is the case with my Mother, Becky. My Papa, Willis, and my Grandmother Mae, were an ecsentric pair. My Grandfather was an Army Captain during WW2, and my Grandmother is a lady shrouded in mystery, at least to me. She was from England, and her mother was a Paranoid Schitzophrenic. They had 6 children 2 of which were from pevious relations. My Aunt Bebe (insane) was my Papa's oldest child. My Aunt Marilyn (sane) was my Grandmother's oldest child. My Aunt Sandra (medicated) was born next, then my Uncle Willis "Bud"(Manic Depressive/drunk/you-name-it), next my Mother (out-of-it/drunk), then my Aunt Michelle (probably drunk). My Grandfather worked with the feds after he retired from the Military, but he opened up a hotel in Destin, Florida. This is where the M's grew up. They had a life full of beaches, suntans, blonde hair, skiing (My mom & my uncle were state champions of skiing), and lots of money. The M's have so many skeletons in their closet that I could write a book on the subject. You'll come to find out that several posts will be about The M's & their antics. Since the death of Willis & Mae, The M's have grown to hate one another & refuse to talk to each other except for at funerals.   I'll wrap this post up now. -Travis :(
