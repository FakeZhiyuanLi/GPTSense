						   well hello all. i have no idea who will read this, and if you are, you will never meet me. this is my most recent post in my other blog, which you will also never know. i started this blog because i cant talk freely there, and i like being able to get comments etc. so here i can use names and specifics, i dont have to worry about what you my readers might find out about me. so heres my post, just LOADED with things i can finaly say.  i found out last night talking to my best friend, ally is a bad idea. talking to frankie (another near-best friend) was never really an option, talking to stacy (a crush/really good friend) would be akward (its probably all in my head, but hey). all it takes is those three little words. jotted down on a peice of paper and passed under a restaurant table, typed into a little grey box in the corner of a screen, muttered into a banged up red cell phone. 'i wanna cut'. it sparks reactions...usualy now theyre ones i dont want to hear. ally starts preaching with all that crap, 'you have to get fixed, you have to confront your feelings now so it doesnt hit you tomorrow with everything your feeling then too' frankie freaks out, nearly starts crying. no guilt for sarah there. of course not. listening to ally's preaching made everything 5 million times worse. it was everything she said to me the last time my parents found out 'im worried everythings going to change, that i wont be able to talk to you anymore'. and here we are, shes so different i hardly know who she is, she sounds like one of my old fucking therapists. hearing how much this all upsets frankie kills me, so ofcourse im not going to tell him because he'll start talking about how worried he is, how much he doesnt want me to get hurt, but instead of that motivating me to be better, it makes me feel worse for imposing all of this on him.  but what i did was good. i felt so fucking awful, and i really wanted to cut, so i told someone, and talked about it. problem is i picked the wrong person to tell (ally). but i told someone. i swallowed my pride and did it. thats a step in the right direction right? yes it is. and since i cant admit to anyone else what happened, and i dont want to bring it up with her again, im going to tell you my new readers that i dont have to worry about offending. i was good. be proud of me. im taking steps in the right direction. granted i stepped onto a bed of hot coals and jumped backwards, but now i know and wont step there again, and can go forward from there.  i feel like i did that day a few weeks ago when stacy told me she was going to tell magge (our dance teacher, we were on a school trip) about everything id been doing. half feeling so awful wanting to scream and rip something apart, half knowing that this is really really good, and so relieved that its finaly going to get better.    so thats the entry. now, just for kicks, im going to give a little bit of background as to ^^ all that stuff. about 2 or 3 weeks ago i got back from a 3 week trip to thailand and china with the dance program at our school. we performed at the opening ceremonies of this big festival, after about 2 weeks of non stop traveling. over the three week trip we took 9 different flights and an overnight train. so i was a little stressed out, so my cutting was getting worse, but my roommate cat and stacy (they both knew) were working with me to find things to do other than cut. they had taken all my sharp objects, with my help, and stacy and i would talk for hours or cat and i would have pillow fights, they were wonderful. but the night before the opening ceremonies i just lost it. the hotel we were in the night before had provided shaving razors in the bathroom, and out of impulse, i grabbed one. so the night before the OCs, i...went crazy. i disected the razor, got the blades out and cut about 4 times on my thigh. you have no idea how sharp those things are. and theyre really thin, flexible, and tiny. so i taped them to the back of my CD player so i wouldnt lose them/drop them. i dont know if i intended to use them again. these cuts were bad. so, fast forward to 4pm the day of the OCs. stacy took my cd player to listen to (she used to cut btw, and is the most wonderful person in the world) and i guess found the blades and of course guessed. i looked up about 5 minutes later and see stacy and frankie standing off to the side, deep in conversation, and frankie looks totaly freaked out, turns out stacy told him she was going to tell maggie, and when i found that out (stacy and i were talking a few minutes later) this flood came over me. i was upset of course, this meant my parents would have to find out, but there was this wonderful feeling of 'finaly. im really glad. its finaly time'.  ok, maybe more to come later, theres a lot ive been wishing i could say in my other blog. goodnight wonderful readers.
