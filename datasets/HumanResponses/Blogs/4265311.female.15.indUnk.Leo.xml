      its so great when the person who is probly the WORST at keeping secrets gets mad at you for telling something that they didnt even tell you not to tell...well they did at one point...but THEN THEY were the one who hinted to the person that they cheated at camp...even tho camp doesnt count..but they were the one who told the person about the other person so when the person asks bout the other person...dont they deserve to kno...and its not like the cheater and person are even gonig out anymore or EVEN LIKE EACHOTHR ANYMORE....and besides...its not like my best friend knows how to keep secrets

           things seem to be goin my way...for now at least. its weird to think that im going to be seeing all those people again, most of whom i havent seen since last year. i mean i wonder how much they have changed. i kno that ive changed a lot during this summer- for once i dont feel totally naive. i wonder if im goin to get to kno different people and change who i hang with...well guess i wont kno till i see. people really do change in only a few months. i hung out with someone who was my other best friend and theyre a whole new person...and yeah its a good thing :)   now, for my day. i went to an asb thing which was fun i think that this is gunna be a good way for me to expand my friends. then i went to solano and got "lunch" then i went to c's house and then i went to g's house and had dinner and played baseball and soccer and stuff- it was acutally really fun. today was a pretty awesome day  when i look back at this summer its been totally insane-but its over now. and things are going to be different beacuse im different
