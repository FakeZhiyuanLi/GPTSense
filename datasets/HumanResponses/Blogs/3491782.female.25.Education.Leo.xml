      Call it reminiscing, but I find myself going back to listening to all or most of the music I listened to in high school or during my freshman/sophomore years of college. I haven't listened to Public Image Ltd. since probably my senior year of HS, but here I sit, really appreciating every last part of it like I never have before. I encourage every last one of you to break out your old music collection and listen to every single CD until it gives you meaning. It'll be well worth your time.

      I'm reading this book called "Stiff". It's about cadavers, the different things that they are used for, the stages of decomposition, autopsies, etc. I found out something that was really disturbing, considering the fact that I am planning to donate my body to science when I kick it. Cadavers are used by medical students who are going to school to specialize in plastic surgery. I already knew that before you die, you're not going to know what your corpse will be used for, and neither will your friends or family. The most degrading situation that could happen to me would be lying on a table, dead, with a med. student practicing a face lift on me. Or a fucking tummy tuck, liposuction, goddamned implants.... Pretty much, regardless of how much I've denounced superficiality while I was living, there is a slight possibility that I could do the exact OPPOSITE when dead. I now consider cremation...

      So here I go again, signing up for yet another "Let's meet people on the Internet" website, when in all reality, I really DON'T want to meet people on the Internet. The reason why I sign up for this shit is because I constantly need something to create the illusion of business at work, and unfortunately, the Internet's all I've got. I figure, by the time I'm 30, I'll have more Internet acquaintances that I will have friends and acquaintances in real life. I am the biggest walking contradiction that exists. I hate society, but am insanely social. Oh well, fuck it.

      So, my sleeping habits have always been rather sporadic, and I believe that I will soon be coming down with another fit of insomnia. I took one of my five-hour naps last night and woke up covered in sweat and humidity at 4:00am. Pittsburgh this time of year feels like a fucking rainforest, only not nearly as picturesque and with a lot more pollution, filth and concrete. This weather lasts for about 3-4 months, and I try to venture into the outside world as little as possible during the summer months. So anyway, I walked downstairs into the comfort of my living room, turned on the air conditioning and decided to watch my favorite thing at 4am, the History Channel. The best thing about watching the History Channel at 4am is that you don't have anyone sitting next to you complaining about your dorkdom and asking you repeatedly to turn it off. The second wonderful thing about watching the History Channel at 4am is that it has some of the most fascinating stuff on it in the middle of the night. I watched an hour-long biography about Rasputin last night. Before I started watching it, I took some Tylenol PM to help me sleep, but even though it started to knock me out about half an hour after I took it, I wouldn't let myself sleep until I was done learning about Rasputin. Which brings me to the point I have made time and time again... I should've attended school at night. Things just aren't as interesting when it's daylight out.
