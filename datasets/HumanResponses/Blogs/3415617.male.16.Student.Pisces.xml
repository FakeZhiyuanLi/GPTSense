      My friend Matt said this the other day: "If you think life is bad now, how would you like to be an egg? You only get laid once. You get eaten once. It takes four minutes to get hard, only two minutes to get soft. You share your box with 11 other guys, but worst of all, the only chick that ever sat on your face was your mom! So cheer up, your life isnt that bad!" Thanks Matt

      I hate thunder. It's not like it scares me, its just that it messes up the electricty. And well, I need to finish a 33 page biology report due for tomorrow and I can't with the power fading in and out.

      Just got back from my gf's junior prom. Fun stuff. Really long though. And all they played was hip hop, only one rock song the whole time, Enter SAndman. DJ was a douche bag. Hurt my back dancing because Katie is so short. I shoulda gone to the after party though.

      My sister is such a spaz. She comes home from softball after losin and she's all upset. She opens the screen door and then it shuts on her finger and she starts cryin like she lost her hand. Then I give her some ice and my mom takes a look at it and goes "Well it hurts because its cut." Cue rediculously louder crying. Rofl

      I was just looking at the Lixasone website and I decided to  see how many posts on average I make a day (4.7) and it says I make over 25% of all the posts there. I am the uber spammer

      Anybody here play on Xbox Live? My name is Anti Le1 in game and I usually play Splintercell: Pandora Tomorrow and Rainbow Six 3. Sometimes I'l play Crimson skies too. Really good guy to play SC:PT is Xvpower. Hes the man and a half. If you do have Live put your Account name and what games you play in the comment so I can stalk you in the virtual world.

      Lol the seniors at my High School had their last day of classes today. The Vice Principle got on the PA this morning and was said "Today is the first step on the end of your journey." Lol stupid guy. Then he goes "Anyone caught out of dress code will have to wear a jakcet, tie, and blazer." (I go to a priv school and we have gay uniforms.) He was onfire with the stupid today. Then the seniors for the last day of school for them pick a song to play over the PA between periods, well aparently the VP didnt like the song so he played Hotel California instead, which was way too long to hear in 3 minutes. So everybody figured he'd start it up where he left it off. Oh no, not commander dumb fuck, he played it from the begining until the same point every period. He ruined the song for me. I hope his Jaguar explodes tomorrow.

      Anybody ever seen this shit, it looks cools so I'm gonna buy it, just wondered if anybody has seen it. Its likes Blue Submarine #6, with the mix of 3d and anime. Weird setting, planet where its divided by a super storm thing and people fly planes called Van Ships that have no wings and shit. Weird stuff.  urlLink Last Exile site  Found it by accident looking for a mech picture.

      Hey, real name's Mike, but I go buy the name Anti in these parts. I'm an anti social guy who's whole focus in life is to play all the games I possibly can. I'm getting into sound editing/mixing and I'm a decent mapper. I belong to a gaming clan, Lixasone. We're a motley crew when you first meet everybody, but with a short amount of time you'll see we're a strong gaming community thats queer as hell.Woo  urlLink Lixasone Home page (check out the forums)
