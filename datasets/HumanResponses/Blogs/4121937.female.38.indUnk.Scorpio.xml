       In Johannesburg electric fencing seems to be the norm, and I always believed that is was not necessary down here in Cape Town. We don't live in an upmarket suburb, but close to town and houses here are not cheap, but then they aren't cheap anywhere in Cape Town anymore.    We have quite a few families living in our road, with lots of little kids, and the domestics all know each other, go to the park or the local cafe together, and walk to the station after work. So it's not like it's a deserted road during the day which would kind of be more enticing for burglars.    It all started a few weeks ago, the first incident was that our domestic worker was in the house when somebody was trying to kick down our back door. We have great alarming and panic buttons all over, so she reacted fast and the guy ran off.    Two weeks later, same kind of scenario, but she now saw the guy, a person wearing a balaclava and carrying a panga knife. Again she reacted and the police arrived quickly as did the armed response. No sign of the guy though.    Last week it got considerably worse. Our nanny was putting our smallest child down for a nap, walked back to the kitchen to see a man in the house. She screamed, he turned around saw her, started cursing her, grabbed a knife out of his socks or shoes and walked toward her. She ran, screaming, opened the front door, activated the panics, - all the neighbours came out, and actually saw the guy face to face as he ran off down the road. He of course wasn't caught, but I don't even care about that. Our little one woke up in midst of all the screaming and he is still not well, he keeps talking about it and waking up at night. I just get really mad, the bastards, coming into the house like that.    However, we were all truly shaken and made some frantic phonecalls to a whole lot of customers and withing 24 hours we had the whole bloody place surrounded by electric fencing. All modern, connected to alarms, panics, sirens, armed response etc. Doesn't look as bad as I feared, and worth the peace of course.   Haven't bothered putting up warning signs yet, and am secretly hoping someone will come and try climb over the walls again. And it will take me a while to call an ambulance...

       Having grown up in Germany, a country that prides itself on efficiency and cleanliness, living in South Africa, with all kind of bugs being part of life, can sometimes be a bit taxing. Well so I thought, I never realized how bad it can get.   Until   Saturday morning.    We live in Cape Town, and it is winter here, and very cold and rainy. So this very vibey, trendy restaurant in town, decided to hold a Christmas in July charity ball. Beautifully organised, the whole place set out in glittering, shiny Christmas decorations, a marquee in front of it, with a stage and dance floor. Lots of entertainment, magicians that come to the table, body painted "artists" twisting and doing yoga kind of movements for you. Music, food stations, everything. Came at a fee, but the proceeds go to a charity for Aids orphans, so every penny was worth spent.    As I'm not very good at doing my own hair I booked an appointment in a salon for a wash and blow dry. Normal thing. I had been a few days before. When I arrived, I saw the stylist look up from her magazine with a more than usual "I've been waiting for you" look. Just something in her eyes made me think: what's that about, I'm not late..   Instead of sending me straight to the basin for the wash thing, she said, "have a seat."    "I noticed you have a very dry scalp." She continued. Then she started examining my hair, putting clips in it, moving strands of hair around and then turning to her collegue, calling her over. The funky purple haired collegue came over, took a look, nodded - and left. Just like that.    I felt my heart beat go up, we do live in Africa and I have 3 children, two of which are at school. And when people start investigating your hair like that, you kind of have an inkling of what the hell is going on.    "I'm awfully sorry, but you have nits in your hair" -    Yes,you heard right, nits as in lice! OHHH my God. It all came to me in an instant. There had been an outbreak of lice at one of my kids schools, and we had struggled to get rid of it, I won't bore you with the details. Of course, I never, ever ,thought that I could catch it, and I wasn't sure who to kill first, or if I should just drop dead myself, right there.    "You are kidding? Nits? That can't be! Are you sure? " I asked. The stylist continued to tell me that,apparently they had had a problem at the salon, that there had been some kind of lice epidemic, and that a few of their "ladies" had been affected. - Didn't believe a word. She just said that to make me feel better, or to try and pretend that this was no big deal. But she didn't fool me. Sweet as she was. She kind of apologized that she was not able to touch my hair and could I please go home and sort it out. I kind of pretended I didn't know what to do, and she filled me in that the pharmacists have special shampoos etc.    I then asked her how on earth I can get up and leave without dying of embarrassment, and she assured me that no-one knew and I could just go. LOL. Another lie. ALL the stylists knew,I'm sure.    Well, I just got up with my messy, nit infested hair and walked out.    Outside I immediately grabbed my mobile phone and called my husband who was at a play center for little kids called Dingy Dungles in our family, better known as Jimmy Jungles in the adult world.    He answered and asked me how things were. I gave him hell, telling him that I was not good at all, that we can cancel the bloody ball, and that I was going to kill each of the three kids, and that it was his fault for having so many kids and that he chose a bad school which was lice infested.    He knows me well, and loves me, he started laughing, and said buy the lice stuff and I'll meet you at home and I will help you get the nits out.    So I bought some lice killing new age plus lice spray, a nailpolish which was on sale, a conditioner, a bubble bath at the pharmacy. On my way to the parking lot I bought a pair of black and silver highheels ( also on sale).    At home, my husband swore I had nothing of the sorts in my hair, while pulling little bits of "dry scalp" out..    I landed up putting rollers in my hair and wasn't to unhappy with my appearence in the end, considering the circumstances.    So we went to the ball and it was great, although it was also not what it was supposed to be, but that's a story for another day....   Oh, I won't even bother mentioning what I discovered when I checked the two older kids hair... Fact is, the pharmacy scored when my husband hotfooted it there to do another purchase. :)   I don't know if I will ever go back to that hairdresser though, I'm still trying to figure out a story I can tell them when I go back. Any ideas?
