      So. I've been gone. Because it turns out, I did venture home. had to come back before memorial weekend because there are many important parties at which to be, but spending time with my family was a good break from city life. Annoying little brother, bitchy older sister, curious mother, and unusually pleasant father, all were deserving of some time with me. As a note, I'd like to add the next time I go back, I call in advance and have them lock aforementioned little brother in a cage. I swear, I was so close to spilling blood on the carpet.  Plenty of good things going on in life currently. I'm living the dream, as it would go. I finally did find a woman, which you may know if you've been reading. Everything looks like it's going to be pretty permanent with her. Besides that, I'm fairly set in my career. Having much fun with it. I promise not to post these same things anymore. Last time, honestly.  Have any of you readers.. I think your total comes to about one(Just you, I believe, Satan).. anyway, have you ever experienced one of those out of body feelings? It could be while you're riding in something, or sitting in front of the TV, and you just feel kind of off, like you're not there? Happened to me on the plane ride back from home. Looking out the window, I just dazed off, and felt likng I was watching myself from another viewpoint. Odd thing to feel, really. It's quite usual for me to daze off, about every half hour I suddenly stare into nothing because of something I think about. But never this intensely. I was thinking so much, I'm pretty sure I actually ended up thinking about -nothing-.  Anyway... blah, blah, blah. I'm done. I've had enough for the moment. I intend to play Halo until my fingers are raw now. I would get on, but any minute I'm supposed to be getting picked up to go out. My ride is unpredictable, though, so I have to be ready to run out in seconds, and the computer just isn't that easy to get away from. So, until next time, have fun, don't drink and drive, and don't run with scissors.

      Okay. So, I was walking down the hallway out of my apartment, when I bump into some dude. There's a mumbled sorry, but then the guy takes another look at me, and says "Hey, your name is Clint, isn't it?" "Yeah... any reason for asking?" And the guy walks off. Nothing else. Creeeepy. I don't even know who it was.  Now, a word about the movie Van Helsing. The plot could definately use some work, but the fight scenes are fun to watch. Especially the final fight, which I'll only explain as a demon-type creature vs. a werewolf. It was so extremely cool, just watching two superpowerful fantasy creatures beating the hell out of each other.Barely blocking anything, just blow after rip after blow delivered every time. So cool.  That's about it for now. Same routine, same as always. I may be venturing home soon, as I haven't seen any of my family in a long time. I'm happy about that because my father wasn't exactly the msot caring person, but meh. I still miss everyone else. Out for now.

      Meh. Mood of the day, kids: Overworked-ness. Haven't had much sleep just lately. worked alot. Gotten very little rest. Starting to snap at people. Think I'm going to go to bed early, way early, and get plenty of sleep in. But before I do, i figured I'd update.  So, yeah, you get the idea of what Monday and today have been like. Working. A lot. very little sleep, because I'm an idiot, and like to stay up late. So it -is- my fault. It's not my fault that some of my habits include waking up very early with things to do, and going to bed very late because I sit in a chair and watch TV in a zombie-like state. So I've got to fix that.  So, yeah.. not gonna say much else. Not much else to say. Heh, I'm like Yoda, 'cept with words... Anyway. Right. Sleep for me. I'll apologize for this being such a meager update, but meh.. you all know how it is when you've worked too much, and not slept enough. I'd wager most of the College kids do right now(Heh... finals). So, I'm off to sleep. Have fun.

      Okay... update. Something incredible has happened.  Remember how I mentioned going on a date? Well, I've always been a strong believer in true love, and I've turned down a lot of women just because it didn't feel right. I don't know if that makes me a jerk or a hopeless romantic. You pick.  But now.. it all paid off. The girl I happened to meet.. the date started off like any other. Blah blah blah, smalltalk, laughter. But soon, I actually started paying attention.I know.. how would I expect to meet a girl if I ignored all of them? The same thought hit me on that date, so I started listening. turns out, this girl is wonderful. Funny, smart, sexy without being slutty. I felt like I was talking to a friend, not a date, and that's always been important to me. We got home, talked. Nothing happened. Absolutely nothing. We talked, drank wine, I drove her home (Err... I may have been a little drunk, so it was unsafe to drive.). All that happened was a little good night kiss. Rather than disappoint me, it just makes me excited. Just thinking about her makes me nervous, and excited and happy, and all that jazz. So, end of the deal, Clint will probably not be a whiny single guy for much longer. He'll be a whiny guy with a girlfriend.  Enough about that. If I haven't sickened you by now, I'd be surprised. In any case... yes, subject change time. So, another update on the money situation. Let me just inform you that having money to spend is great. And being able to support yourself... such a wonderful feeling. I'm not yet to the point of saving up for an Escalade, but it shouldn't be too many months.   Work is wonderful. Many people hate their job. I do not. I've gotten to meet sao many new people, got to go to so many upperclass parties, learned so much from people that have been through life and become very successful. Let me advise you of some. Judge a man or woman not by how he or she treats a superior, or even an equal, but by how they treat someone of a lower status. If your boss treats you bad.. get the hell out. Believe it or not, there are plenty of bosses out there that are nice, incredible people. Also, take into account they have bad days just like you. Try talking to your boss sometime, just having a normal conversation, asking them how they are. You may learn something.  Also, as a last comment... this will be continued. I got a comment. I have readers. I'm so proud. It makes me all, happy, and joy-like. Hopefully. I'll be able to update at least three times a week. hell, maybe every day. It all depends on how things happen. That's all for now. Over and out.

      So, I'm beginning to believe no one reads this. Which means I'm talking to myself. venting my thoughts is not enough. I demand comments before I post any more.

      First real post.. in case you couldn't guess. feel free to comment, as otherwise, I don't know if anyone is actually reading this. Bit of a warning, I'm going to vent right now.  How can people make fun of others that are mentally handicapped? Honestly, how does a human being find that even remotely possible? It's just like making fun of a blind person, or a deaf person. Maybe worse. The story is this: I was taking a stroll down the street, when I came across a group of kids sitting with a mentally handicapepd boy about their age. They were making fun of him, from what I caught. Most of it stopped as soon as they noticed me, because kids don't do that in front of adults. But I knew they had been. And it pissed me off. The worst thing was, they led this boy to think he was their friend. Can you believe that? It just... agh. It almost makes me sick when I think that humanity could have sunk so low.  On a less tender subject... money. Finally got some. Paying off everything I owe for living situations, paying friends back for what they loaned me.. finally out of debt, with a bit to spare that I don't need to save away. That means a night on the town. I'm thinking Friday. Go out and get as drunk as possible. When there are three different places to grab a drink less than half a mile from where you live.. Whoo. It's like the world is just -asking- you to party. I might not get so drunk.. still hoping to meet a girl. Still single. Imagine that, eh? If only the story in 'Pretty Woman' was true. I could pick up a hooker, and refine her, and fall in love. Sadly, doesn't work out this way. What I can do, is go out with a recent girl I met through my job. Ivy League education, fairly attractive, funny, and she wants to save the whales. Hoping something will get started there, but meh.. optimism is not Clint's major point. Anyway.. that is it for now. Again... comment. Please. I'm desperate.

      Gonna attempt to keep a blog. Attempt. Right now, I don't know. I have about five minutes to be out the door. Some first post this is going to be. Ever had a contractor yelling at you to hurry up? I'd rather be getting attacked by rabid wolverines. Is that the right spelling? Anyway...  Looks like some of my friends have lives that aren't going so well. Well, join the club, eh? Looking at their blogs is depressing. It's like reading a tradgedy you missed the first half of. For any of you reading this.. you know who you are. And I know how most of you think. I'm going to lay this straight. STOP BEING SO DAMNED DEPRESSED. Flow with it, baby. Let the bad times roll.  Anyway... that's it for the moment. Update, soon, I'm hoping to manage. (Hahahahah.. got you. No, really, I'll try.) Next time, I'll actually post. I don't think this could classify as a post. Anyway, before Bob the Builder stabs me with a letter opener, I'm gonna go. A big see you later from Vegas.

      Too lazy to think of a title. Anyway, about this time I feel it necessary to warn you. Don't see 'The Day After Tomorrow'. The movie sucked. Big time. No realy characters you can cling to and really feel good with, the plotline centers around being whatever it needs to be so the director has an excuse to wipe out landmarks with massive tornadoes, and flooding.  Now, besides that, I have -big- job coming up. May be absent for a long while. This job, while it will be quite difficult, should put a fair amount of money in the bank. And leave some left over to go towards E3 tickets for next year. Hey, when I'm this close to Cali, I'm not going to pass up E3. That would be stupid. But I gotta start my saving up for it now.  Besides that, I feel that I need to relate something. This is my first full summer in Nevada. I came here late last summer, and it was laready cooling down somewhat. Let me just tell you... I am glad beyond reason I have Air Conditioning. I could crack some eggs on the street, and they would be done in less than a minute. It's a wonder car tires aren't suddenly popping from heat expansion. I swear, neither Ohio or Delaware -ever- got this kind of heat. It's going to take getting used to for me. I should've expected it, moving to the middle of a desert...  That's about it for now. Not much. Not too little, either, though. So I'll sign off here, and get back to worshipping the AC. While I do paperwork. Paperwork, fun, yay. I just hope I don't find a lighter, or I may be tempted to start a fire with all that fun paperwork.
