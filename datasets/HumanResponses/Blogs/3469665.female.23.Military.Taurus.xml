      Ok, so yesterday was better. There is just something about getting out of work and home by noon. It always brings a insipid smile to my face. So anyway, I got home, stripped down and hopped in bed. I've got one of those beds with a pillowtop mattress...I added a feather bed on top of that, covered it with 300 count Egyptian cotton sheets and then put four more down comforters on top of that. It makes for some happy heavenly sleeping. Anyway, I got up after a solid three hour nap, fought with my family on the phone and then went to my Brazilian ju-jitsu class. Talk about an ass whooping. Good grief. My upper body didn't stop quivering until after dinner. It was an odd sensation. Anyway, after my class I went to my favorite grocery store, ordered a yum yum sandwich and headed back to my apartment where I sat cross-legged on the floor and ate. My best friend was there too, we were too tired to do much more than gossip feebly. I was going to meet up with the guys to go mountain biking, but I hurt too much. I wanted to go, but then again, I'm still a bit skittish about my lack of mountain biking skills.  Today I have duty...for those of you who are unaware, duty is a cruel and unusual punishment the military dreamed up to ruin perfectly good weekends for Armed Forces members. Someone has to be on the ship at all times and we each take turns on a rotating basis enjoying this special form of torture. So I'm here, sitting, hoping I can sneak over to my room and take a nap, wishing I could go home or at least get outside for a bit. Maybe I'll eat lunch outside.   This is what I hate...you get this bullshit line about joining the Navy and living an adventure, but in reality you're going to spend months on end staring at the same people, watching the same four walls, hoping that maybe if you're lucky they'll let you at some port for a day or so. Even better, they're repeating the same ports over and over and over again so you're really not going anywhere new. By the time I get off work, (when we're in home port) I'm so desperate to see light and have a normal life that I end up staying up almost all night, just so I don't miss a second of my freedom. Only 3 years and 2 months and 5 days to go until I'm free again. *sigh* I guess I'd better go find somewhere to take a nap.

      So I'm sitting here at work, watching people slog back and forth and for the life of me I can't figure out how I wound up working at a place so mundane. I would give anything to be outside right now. It's just hot enough with just the right amount of wind. I wouldn't mind hitting the trails for a run, give my legs a stretch. Maybe I'd grab my bike and work on jumping stuff. I'm supposed to go mountain biking with a friend this Tuesday, but the gap between my experience and his is vastly embarrassing. He's sweet enough that he pretends not to notice (even when I randomly throw myself into the bushes...damn those clipless pedals!) At least he's a good sport!  The trail I've been riding is beautiful. I've been running/riding it for months now, watching it turn from a dull, dead ashy brown to a vibrant, dripping green. I feel like I'm watching a nephew grow up. The down side of all this fecund, viral growth is that the bugs are out in full force. Though I've eaten my fair share, I am apparently not slowing their prolific procreation habits at all! They bounce off my sunglasses, my shirt, dive into my hair and get stuck to my sweat/mud covered legs. *shrug* At least I'd be outside.

      Two weekends ago, I haphazardly stuffed my pack, grabbed my best friend J and headed for the woods. I picked a section of the Appalachian Trail for our little three day hike and J reluctantly acquiesced. We drove for about five glorious hours, through some of the most adorable towns I've ever seen. These were the kind of places that didn't even have a McDonald's and had names like Cuckoo and Gordonville. We finally made it to the mountains, laced up our boots, threw on our packs and hit the trail. Little did I know, this backpacking trip was going to change my life.  Right after we got on the trail, we met a guy named M. He was headed to Rock Spring Hut, only about four miles down the trail. I decided that we weren't going there because I didn't want to be deluged with other hikers. After a few hours of hiking I changed my mind. You see, I've always wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail and I figured that it would be a good idea to hit up this hut so I could meet other thru-hikers and nose around through their packs-to get a good idea of what I would need to buy and all. Anyway, we turned down the trail to the hut and set up camp on one of the pre-prepared camping flats (which actually wasn't all that flat...) Before all this, let me tell you about the trail. I'm in love with backpacking. I don't know what it is, but it has a lot to do with being outside, breathing truly clean air and waking up to birds singing. It's idealistic I know, but I wish I could live out there. Anyway, this hike was the same sort of thing. Huge rock formations, narrow trails, the legendary white blazes on tall beautiful trees. There were open meadows, clean streams and wildflowers everywhere...what more could I ask for? I sped ahead of J, only because I enjoyed the solitude and because I can haul ass when I want to. I always sat on a boulder and waited for her though...to her credit, she kept up well.  Back at the Rock Spring Hut...so we are setting up camp and talking away with TJ and WL, two guys who were setting up camp too and we all decided to eat together. Everyone pooled together their food and shared hot dogs, avocado dip, chocolate and all sorts of other yummies. One of the best things about backpacking a lot is that you can eat whatever you want and as much as you want-you're burning 3-6,000 calories per day anyway.  The other thru-hikers were hilarious, a product of long periods of loneliness combined with mile after mile after mile of solid physical exertion made them talkative, friendly and informative. I got lots of great advice and even better, received a trail name from TJ (if you didn't know, thru-hikers use pseudonyms while hiking to sign the various trail books along the way.) After dinner and a lot of beer (I shared M's vodka and gatorade,) we all went to our tents. Right before I drifted off, I heard, in a loud voice, "YEAH, I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD GET A TAXI TO COME PICK ME UP TOMORROW..." I started laughing. Being the smart-ass that I am, I couldn't resist shouting up the hill at M "AND COULD YOU GET HIM TO BRING A PIZZA? EXTRA CHEESE?" At this point, the other hikers started laughing as well. Who brings a cell phone and calls a taxi from the AT? Fortunately M had a great sense of humor and we all had a good chuckle over it.  The next morning as we were packing up, one of the thru-hikers, WL asked if he could join J and I on our little lap around WhiteOak Canyon. We agreed to drop him off further up the trail so he wouldn't be behind schedule. We started off, adding another hiker to our party, JB which had our group topping off at four hikers. We found the WhiteOak trail and headed down it, WL and myself darting ahead. After a while we came upon our first waterfall (WhiteOak has a concentration of waterfalls which is why I originally picked the trail-I probably should have equated the waterfalls with immense changes in elevation, but I wasn't thinking that clearly!) Anyway, we got in our bathing suits and hopped into the chilly/freezing water for a little refreshment. It was great...there is nothing in this world that beats a dip in a waterfall, followed by some sun-drying on a rock, followed by some lunch cooked over a camp stove, followed by some more hiking. I was in heaven...honestly I could have stayed there forever. Anyway, we repeated our little swimming trip two more times, each time, hurriedly stripping down and jumping (against our common sense,) into a pool of frigid water. At this point WL (S) and I had discovered that we had tons of things in common including a trip to DC planned for the next weekend. We agreed to swap phone numbers and hang out when we got there.  The hike was a tinsy bit harder than I thought and J was ready to beat me senseless when we finally got out of the canyon. She was even more angry when I shot down the suggestion that we stay in a hotel for our next night. I did concede a hot dinner at the trail restaurant, but I could tell she wasn't happy with me.  Anyway we hit the trail again, this time rushing to find a place to camp before dark. After nearly running down the trail, S found us a spot and we put up our tents by headlamp. We each grabbed our booze and sat on our sleeping pads, getting good and drunk to the sound of light rain falling on the canopy of leaves over us. Finally J went to be while JB, S and I took a drunken night hike to a nearby outlook. We sat there for a while, watching the stars and finishing off our booze and then we stumbled back to our tents. The next morning, J took off early for the car while JB, S and I packed everything up. As we were walking to the car, I invited S to come stay with me in Virginia Beach (he said earlier that he missed the beach a lot,) and I'd drive him to DC on the weekend. After a short hesitation, S agreed and headed back to the car for the ride home. We dropped off JB at his truck, swapped e-mail addresses and said goodbye through the misty morning air and J,S and I drove home...TO BE CONTINUED...
