       Some things, some people, prove so important to kids, and in the course of their everyday, mundane lives, they never know the impact they've made on the little ones they touch.     &nbsp;   "Kenny is the sweetest kid!" I hear it everywhere I go! Especially from his teachers! Kenny is the kid every teacher wishes she could clone.&nbsp; It all began during a parent-teacher coference&nbsp;in first grade when his over-fifty, experienced teacher gushed with tears in her eyes "I have to tell you, I just love Kenny!" And it was mutual. Kenny was so in-love with Mrs. Hotten that the love was transferred over to all things educational.&nbsp; Every child should be blessed with a first grade teacher who so loves her job that the children in her class are sad to go to second grade! Working in the high school, I see plenty of students whose first grade teachers failed to realize the importance of experiencing "Henry and Mudge" or "Clifford the Big Red Dog."&nbsp; Personally, I have two favorites: "Harold and the Purple Crayon" and anything with "Miss Spider" in it.&nbsp; The illustrations in Miss Spider's books are so wonderfully created that the pages would be perfect for escaping into a fantasy.    Kenny's first love is fairly obvious to anyone who has the opportunity to visit with him for ...a nano-second. It is his guitars that make the boy's heart pound like the drums in a head-hunter movie. I know, I've heard them when I watched him walk into the Guitar Center.&nbsp; He acquired this love of guitar through a music teacher who was donating his time at Kenny's elementary school when he was in the third grade.&nbsp; The minute he picked up the guitar, you could tell it was love at first sight. The polished wood of the guitar seemed to glow under his little hands.&nbsp; We purchased his first electric guitar for his ninth birthday: A BC Rich Warlock!&nbsp; Okay, so it's a little extravagant for a nine-year old. We wanted him to be able to experience his dreams early to see if they would stick.&nbsp;Our neighbor bought him an amp (don't ask me, I don't know what kind.) to go with the guitar. Heaven for a ten year old boy is created with a nine year old girl, an 11 year old girl and&nbsp;two 13 year old boy standing on the sidewalk as Kenny played the Star Spangled Banner, ala Jimmy Hendrix. The girls squealed, which is, I think, today's equivalent of swooning, the boys' heads jerked like the spasms of dying birds, which I take to mean enthusiasm. And Kenny? Kenny flipped guitar picks like Rick Nelson from Cheap Trick. It was genius, pure genius! Thank you Jeff Bretz for offering the time . You'll never know what you did for him.   Lord, please bless all those teachers who heard your call, who make everyday an adventure for our children. Lord, to those who are discouraged, send a little blonde haired child who melts their hearts. To those who are tired, send a little red-haired&nbsp;child to make them laugh. To those who are hurting, send a little dark-haired child to encourage their hearts.&nbsp; To those who have joy, please Lord, send my children. I thank you, In Jesus' name, Amen. GracieFairy's Mommy   &nbsp;

      Bobby wanted a baby. Not a girl baby or a boy baby. Just a baby. At the age of three, after asking why Nicholas, his cousin could have a baby and he couldn't, I decided to leave it in God's hands and teach him a lesson about praying in the meantime. I simply told him, "You'll have to ask God, He sends the babies." He asked. In a crowded grocery store, when a lady with a cute baby walked by, he would lift his head toward heaven and yell, "God! I want a baby!" At the pool, when the mommies walked by with strollers, he'd yell "God! I want a baby!" In Toys R Us, walking past the baby toys, he'd yell "Hey God! WHERE'S MY BABY?" Evening prayers began and ended with "God, I reaaallly want a baby!"  For two years, selfish mother that I am, I went along with it. I only needed one carseat to handle. No more diapers, yet, if ever. I was so smug! God does NOT like smugness! Nope, nosireee Bob. God heard Bobby!Two weeks after the rabbit committed suicide, I decided to surprise him. "Bobby, remember when you asked God for a baby the other night?" "Yes." "Well, God's sending you a baby." I expected the equivalent of fireworks bursting in the air in our apartment. Instead, I got "okay." For days I would see him talking at the mailboxes to the mailman. His little face would fall, and he'd drag his feet back into the apartment. I asked him, "Bobby, what's wrong? Was the mailman mean to you?" "No, I'm mad because I'm not getting a baby. I tried to tell him I was, but he keeps telling me that he's not gonna' bring my baby to me not matter what God says!So I guess I'm not getting it!" Isn't that what we do to God? We ask and ask and ask for the same things, and we listen to other people asking for things knowing full well, in our infinite wisdom that God wouldn't possibly answer that prayer! And when it finally is about to be delivered, we fall back into disbelief, or we let ourselves listen to that voice of doubt in our friends or our families, or even ourselves. God is waiting for our faith to move the mountains before us, not our need. Despite the outward appearance, or modern wisdom, He is waiting for us to acknowlege that He alone, is the Most High God who answers our call! Isn't He wonderful!

      No amount of preparation could have prepared me for Bobby's first day of school.  Books have been written about how watching a kindergartener go off to school with a brand new lunchbox, newly purchased tennis shoes and fresh scrubbed face created bathtubs of tears. Did I glance wistfully as he walked away, or walk into walls as a looked for a last glimpse of my precious baby? HEAVENS NO! I jumped into the car to race home to do what I thought every sane mother of a five year old boy would do...rip off my clothes, run to the tub and turn on the faucet without someone with little grubby fingers beating me to the faucet. My first quiet bath in a hundred years, or so it seemed! After the long soak, I realized, MY Goodness! The phone! I could actually talk on the phone without listening to the Ninja turtles battle, or holding the phone under my chin while I wiped peanut butter and jelly off the keyboard! Everyone I knew who didn't still have kids at home was at work! I still had hours! I needed a plan! Sitting down with a pencil and pen, I devised a schedule: I could get all the housework done in two hours, and still have two hours to pursue other things!Adult things! When my little hero came home, he'd be excited, I'd be excited, it would be wonderful.Two weeks later, he came home with head lice. Three weeks later, his red bumps were chicken pox. Six weeks into school, I struggled to get his lunchbox, homework, and clothes together in time for him to be ON TIME for school! Standing before the mirror, I noticed my blotchy eyes, queasy stomach, dull hair, sore boobs and made a mental note to do "something" about myself. And "where,' I wondered 'had all my free time gone?" I'd look into it as soon as I took a short nap. Two days later, as my insides exited through my mouth for the third time in the last three days, I knew it! Fate, that master of irony had done it again. My free time would be replaced with doctor's visits and weigh-ins and sonograms and stretch pants. That rabbit hadn't just died, he committed suicide!

      Why is it that we always seem to hurt the ones we love the most? And we start it at such a young age! Gracie, Katie, Joey and Kenny were outside playing with a little girl down the street. The little girl asked GracieFairy "who do you like more, Katie or me?" Of course, Gracie said, "Karen."  "Who do you like more, Moses (Karen's brother) or Joey?"  "Moses."  Who do you like more, Bobby or Daniel (Karen's other demon brother.)"  "Daniel."  To Gracie, she was telling the truth. Daniel, Karen and Moses don't care if she goes in the street, or walks around with her pull-up looking like a thong under her tee shirt. They don't have to share their prized possessions, and they don't tattle when Gracie erupts with a bad word here or there.  To Katie, who is 12 going on 23, Gracie was choosing children over her family. And it hurt.  It made me think about God, and how he must feel when we get involved in things we shouldn't...like hurtful gossip, or fighting to get to the top at work even if it hurts others. He asks us, "Who do you like more? Me, or the world? When I discipline you, do you grumble and snivel, and turn to the things of the world to lick your wounds.  Would that we could all choose the things, the people who love us the most, but it's nice to know that when we miss the mark, He's still there, like Katie, to give us His grace, or a cookie, when we ask.

      Being the mother of children of such a wide age range is amazing! The Prince took a picture of Bobby when he was 5 or 6 sitting on the toilet. It's a nice picture, side view, and all you can see is the toilet and the pants around his ankles. He has always had this thing about the toilet. When it's his turn to take out the trash...in the bathroom; clean out the car...in the bathroom; wash dishes...in the bathroom.  It really frustrates his two younger brothers. Joey, aged 6, is also a throne sitter. We are currently remodeling our house. Wallpaper border just seems to stick better with spray adhesive. I don't know how it happened, I am not pointing any fingers, but recently I came home to find disgusting hair around the toilet seat in the hall bathroom.  When I went to clean it, it wouldn't come off. Apparently, Bobby's aggressive demand that Joey let him in the bathroom resulted in Joey spraying the adhesive on the toilet seat. Yep. A half an hour later, according to Katie the Chronicler (tattletale to most of us,) a roar erupted from the bathroom.  Bobby was stuck to the toilet seat. So, do I laugh 'til I pee or do I rid myself of any responsibility?

       I am leaving today&nbsp;for&nbsp;two weeks.&nbsp;One of my sisters has been ill and one of my sisters is getting married, so, I am going to Oklahoma and Kansas for two weeks with my eldest sister. &nbsp;While I am excited about being with the sissies, I am so anxious about leaving the Prince and the Princelets. It isn't as if I won't be in contact with them, I have my cellular leash, my lap-top, and all the sissies have desktops and phones, too. I just won't get to see her and she changes so quickly these days. I can't imagine fourteen days without her sucking my eyeballs out (it's really a covert way to get extra kisses from her.) I don't want to think about who will paint the nails on her little "stinkies" (Probably, Katie, she's such a good mommie junior!) My heart hears her crying in the middle of the night when she can't find mommy's love handles. I worry that the Prince and the Princelets won't understand what is going on when she is cranky.   Her vocabulary is growing exponentially every day. Her expressions are so darling, I cringe thinking I won't be here to hear them. Yesterday, from the backseat, I heard her tell her brother and sister, "You two need to stop talking, I'm talking to Mommy! I talking to you, Mommy!"&nbsp;   Most of all, I am worried that she is so young, her feelings will be hurt because Mommy is leaving her behind. I cannot fathom&nbsp;how a 2 3/4 years old child interprets that.&nbsp; While I'm excited, I'm anxious.      Lord, you said "Be&nbsp;careful for nothing, but in everything, by prayer and supplication, make your requests known unto God." I know&nbsp;Lord that you are not saying, to be imprudent, but rather, you are saying, don't be full of care, worry or anxiety&nbsp;over anything. So, my supplication is that you would bless and protect the Prince. Give&nbsp;him wisdom to be blessed, to be diligent, to&nbsp;fervently seek you while I am&nbsp;gone. Please bless Robert that he will be the support his father needs. Please let little discordant notes not escalate between the children. Please fill our home with&nbsp;favor and peace. Please help Princess Katie bless&nbsp;her sister, brothers and daddy. Please help her to make good choices while I am gone. Lord, Please comfort Kenny. Lord, he tries too hard to be the perfect child. Please give us patience when he needs to walk his own path, and let us have wisdom to recognize when it is rebellion, and quench it fast. Lord, please walk with Joey. Please let him know the gentleness of your love, and the strength that comes from choosing obedience. &nbsp;Please protect and provide for GracieFairy. Be especially attentive to her heart, Father, so she will know her mommy loves her. Please watch over all the children and the Prince and keep them safe until I come home. I thank you and praise you for your mercy and grace. In Jesus' Name, I pray,       Amen.      Gracie, please know that Mommy loves you, and I will be home before you know it.     &nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Princess Katie loved water when she was little. Front yard water? Loved it! Pool water? Loved it! Mud puddle water? Loved it! Bathtub water? Loved it! I even caught her dipping a glass into the toilet, taking the glass to Bobby, who thought it came from the cooler, and I barely stopped him from drinking it! Little Katie sunshine still loves water! At 12 years old, she will still take her fashion dolls into the shower and sit in the bottom of it playing until the waterheater runs out. "It's like playing in the rain, mom!" She loves to try to take Gracie into the shower or the tub with her and Gracie hates it!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is it that the same child who sambas in the rain, skips through puddles, shimmies through the sprinklers and can swim the Englis Channel suddently becomes "'llergic" to water the minute the faucet is turned on in the tub?&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the time Bobby and Katie were little, we had problems with bathtime. Bobby, the Ninja Turtle lover hated bathtime. No amount of coaxing, no pretty little soap crayons, no growing sponges would make it easier for him. He hated it and that was it! Katie was so different! Katie loved it all---the pretty soaps, the loofah, the sponges, the moisturizers in mommy's bathroom. She had to try it all. When she was small, I usually let her take one bath by herself in the morning---yes, I watched her, it was just really a morning ritual play time. Then, at the end of the day, she took a bath that included the soap, shampoo and baby lotion and powder. Just like mommy. That lasted quite a while, until the Prince got the water bill. He told me that Katie had to be dirty at least part of the day, or she had to bathe at the neighbor's house. Or I had to bathe at the neighbor's house.Today, she still likes to take two baths a day.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It isn't that Gracie likes being dirty. It isn't even that she hates baths.&nbsp; Still, being the youngest child of five, she takes the brunt of their teasing.&nbsp; In the pool, in the front yard, Gracie can be sitting there minding her own business, and Joey will come flying in like a buzzard and splash water all in her face!&nbsp; If she takes a bath with Joey and Kenny, inevitably,&nbsp;in her&nbsp;babyfairy mind, they're trying to kill her!&nbsp;They get her hair wet, and put that&nbsp;burning stuff on it trying to&nbsp;take out her eyes! If she is&nbsp;"helping" mommy water the front yard plants, someone runs to tell on her and she gets in trouble...To her, there just&nbsp;is nothing good about water!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gracie is smart. She knows Joey is allergic to smoke and can't be anywhere around it. Bobby is allergic to work and cinnamon and can't be anywhere around either of them. Katie thinks she is allergic to school, and does her best to avoid all parts of it. With the smoke from the firestorm in the mountains around us, she has a good idea of what it means to stay away from whatever you are allergic to.&nbsp; For a while, Kenny insisted he was 'llergic to kisses. It stemmed from his giggle. Every time I kissed him, I had to "get the sugar" from his neck because he laughed so infectiously. He was 'llergic to kisses to be tickled more.&nbsp; Last night,&nbsp;Gracie announced she&nbsp;was&nbsp;not taking a bath with Joey, because she was&nbsp;"llergic." Something in my memory clicked...She's too young to understand that Bobby was 'llergic to bathwater... I wonder if it is genetic.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gracie has decided she's 'llergic to: taking showers with Katie; sharing my bed with Joey; and&nbsp;letting&nbsp;Bobby tell her what to do.&nbsp; Thank Goodness, she's not 'llergic to kisses.&nbsp;

        Sometimes, I wonder what it is that I love so much about Gracie's feet! We already know she loves shoe'ies, a trait I passed on to both my precious girlies. Still, even when she runs around outside in her sling-back sneakers (yes, they make sling-backed sneakers for little fairies), and decides to unleash the smell of a toxic waste dump as she takes them off and insists I kiss her "stinkies," I love them.&nbsp; With dirt around and under every little toenail, from playing outside all day, I will still lift them to my lips for a nibble or a kiss just to hear her erupt in infectious giggles.   At night, when she is bathed, powdered and has that sleepy, warm, snuggly milky scent to her, the toes are right there, perfect pink pearls peeking out from her pajamas. You would never know that as Graciefairy drifts off to sleep, the feet become demented, raging monsters that must subdue everything in their path.  To understand the mystery behind this, you must realize that Graciefairy has a beautiful toddler bed of her own. She has Humpty Dumpty sheets (since he's one of mommy's heroes,) a Barbie (yes, Nanny, Barbie-not beheaded Barbie, either) comforter and pillow, and a Scoob and Shag throw blanket on her perfect bed. This bed is two feet from my bed. We can reach out and touch hands.&nbsp; Every night, she is placed in her little perfect bed with her little perfect pillow and her little perfect toes, and a bottle.&nbsp; Somewhere between "Oh God, this is a great dream: an Estate Sale full of quilts, bakelite, embroidered hankies, rag dolls and books and everyone else is lost;" and "No, Mel, I cannot go to dinner with you, I'm married to the Prince," I feel the beating begin. The beating is not the beating of my heart. It is the beating of me to death by those little perfectly pink pearlized toes that have become monsters. Gracie has entered the bed, right between the Prince and I. She is laying or lying, which ever you prefer, diagonally across the bed between us.&nbsp; For the sake of the Prince, I always try to keep the feet on my side of the bed. It's a humanitarian gesture.&nbsp; She begins her assault by using the love handles-on my legs (known as saddle bags, garment bags, steamer trunks, to me) to boost herself up in the bed. Then, she begins boosting herself further with all the rolls I have conveniently grown over the years for her rock-climbing/bed climbing assistance.&nbsp; The end of her ascent occurs when her head reaches the headboard, or the Prince is innocently injured in the journey.&nbsp; This child has the agility of a prima ballerina and the finesse of Wayne Gretzky before he earns the penalty box.     The Bible says "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring the gospel of good news." It also says in Psalms 91 that "He will give his angels charge over you to guard you in all your ways, lest you dash your foot against a stone."   Lord, I thank you for watching over Gracie's feet. Thank you for keeping her safe in all her ways. Thank you for letting her take the Gospel of Peace everywhere she goes. And thank you most of all Lord, that her feet don't smell like those of Grandpa and the Prince.

        I really don't want to be an alarmist, but Graciefairy seems to have questionable taste in men and I'm a little concerned for her.&nbsp; I can appreciate all the unique effort that went in to making Mike Meyers' movie "Shrek." I can see the potential draw to little girls who like to pretend they are princesses in distress, being held captive by a fire-breathing dragon. I even understand the likeness of some fire-breathing dragons to daddies. So, I wasn't even a little concerned when Shrek came out in a double pack with a 3-D version to entice my little fairy. I figured it was good for her to exercise her imagination...It would give me a break from having to watch that evil, dreaded, dvd (demonic video device): SPIDERMAN. Just in case you were wondering, I have nothing against Peter Parker, Spidey, or even the Green Goblin. I have a problem with watching it at least twice a day for three weeks. So, I thought the story with the green ogre would be entertaining, a welcome break from the web-slinger. The second time we watched the movie, GracieFairy looked sweetly up at me and said, "Mommy, Shrek is my boyfriend!"&nbsp;    Boyfriend!? She isn't even 3 years old! What does she know of a boyfriend? How in the world did she watch this movie and come to this decision? "Hmm, green skin? Okay."    "Tube horns on the head? That's different, okay."    "Anti-social? Okay."    I know sometimes her daddy isn't quite the gentleman he should be, but it appears as if, at the age of 2 and 3/4 years old, that she is either on a mission to reclaim someone, or she's got a thing for bad (and smelly) boys.    Even more than her choice of boyfriend, I mean this isn't an inter-racial problem, it's an inter-species problem, I am worried that her little sensibilities should not know&nbsp;what a boyfriend is before the age of 3 years. Still, on the Cartoon Network, on The Disney Channel,&nbsp;and in the movies they watch, boyfriends are desirable. It's too soon.     &nbsp;    Lord, Please keep GracieFairy a baby as long as possible. Please&nbsp;give me the tools to&nbsp;slow her down when she's moving too fast, and the tools to release her when it's time. Lord, order her steps and please give your angels charge over her in all her ways, according to Psalms 91, lest she dashes her foot against a stone. I thank you and praise you for watching over&nbsp;us.      In Jesus' Name I pray,      Amen.    &nbsp;   GracieFairy, please slow down. Be a baby as long as you can. And when it's time for you to fly, let Jesus fly with you and pick out your friends and paths.    I love you,    Mommy &nbsp;

      Gracie is one of those children that change the way people around her live their lives. I originally saw her in a dream when I was pregnant with Bobby, eighteen years ago. A little brown haired girl was running to the Prince looking like an italian princess, giggling and crying out, "Papa! Papa!" I was sure Bobby, and each of the next three pregnancies was that little italian girl. Nope, not a dark-haired one of the four. They all looked like me.  When Gracie arrived, the day before Thanksgiving 2001, she was special. My heart had stopped during the delivery and many complications created havoc in my body. For her first 11 days, I was in the hospital without her all but two days.  She seemed to know that Mommy needed her. I lived, and began to get better, because I knew God sent her to me. On her first birthday, a week before Thanksgiving, I was at my father's bedside in Oklahoma, as he lay dying. It was the feel of Gracie's chubby hands wiping away my tears when I got home that pulled me through the grief. As she handed me a "nose monster" to make me stop crying, I had to laugh and be thankful for the gifts of life God had given me. It isn't just me that Gracie has touched. She wears her love for us like a cloak and we are all smitten.  She but wimpers in the night and her brothers and sisters are at her side. Her oldest brother Bobby is her loyal slave, a post for which he gladly volunteered.  Katie, the woman-child, tenderly brushes the hair of the sister for which she waited 11 years. Kenny, the musician, turns over his most prized possession, his electric guitar, at Gracie's request. Joey, whose six-year old hands can make china shop bulls proud, gently lays on the pillow with her to watch "Scoob and Shag" for the three-hundredth time. And the Prince. To the Prince, she is the embodiement of all things soft and wonderful. When she runs to his car yelling "Daddy, you're home!" He melts as if he's been gone six months instead of twenty minutes. To Grandma Josephine, she is a "mini-me." It is as if someone put my mother-in-love in the dryer everytime Gracie runs!  Yes, this child is  part fairy dust and part nose monster, and I am so thankful she's mine.
