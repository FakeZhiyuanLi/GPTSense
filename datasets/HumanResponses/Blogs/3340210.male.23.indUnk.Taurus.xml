      ....rollover! rollover! unfortunately i did not win yesterdays triple lottery rollover. gutted. i had so many plans about what id do with the lottery. i tend to dream a bit. i was gonna buy a dead expensive swiss watch and some quality brown leather shoes, and a house in australia and one in spain and one in devon. id also buy a recumbant bicycle, a segway human transporter and a fleet of shopmobility trollies.  if you had to make the choice would you rather be blind or deaf? thats a ponderer for ya.

      man i feel as rough as twigs this morning. last nite was fookin ace from what i rememeber. havent been to snobs in ages, and its all the better for it- they say absence makes the heart grow fonder. got absolutely off my trolley. so much for taking it easy. some quality tune-age last nite. including the mighty roses and reef- place your hands, which always reminds me of the Glenn Hoddle/Eileen Drewery affair. and how fookin ace are Delays?!!! if anything can sooth the roughness of a sunday morning its the delays at a moderate volume on the old stereo system. or a bit of embrace if you wanna be old skool about it.

         how sweet would it be cruising down the beach front on this baby? Granted i havent been on a skateboard since the age of 12, and would probably fall off a lot, and also i dont live by the coast, and its never that sunny over here... but still it would be sweet. unfortunately it costs £160, so i wont be getting it unless i win the £20million rollover this evening.

      a coupla months back a new family moved in up the road from my house. they have the most annoying kids ever. i dont think ive ever seen the parents and i cant count how many kids there are cuz there are so many. about 4 or five juniors aged from 2 to 7, one lad about 14 and a girl around the same age.  the other night nearly tipped me over the edge. i had an early shift the next morning so needed to get to sleep about 10pm. thing is its still light then so the kids are out in the garden, im pretty used to their constant screaming by now (none of them can talk properly and all have ADHD) but this nite they started playing with their new bell- the kind a town crier or school teacher uses. Fortunately this soon became drowned out by the elder male sibling blasting out hardcore drum and bass or whatever at a million decibels. i can tolerate a lot of things. i like to think im pretty relaxed. but sleep deprevation and shit music really get on my tits. old man rant over.

      public transport is poor. for what it is, it is relatively expensive. you get all the usual crazies, plus scallies with attitude problems and perhaps worst of all old grannies repeating the same unimportant drivel to their deaf buddies over and over again. Its cramped, slow, smelly, unreliable. However cars are extremely inefficient. one person in a five seater car is wrong, they are polluting. being caged up in a self contained micro-environment is one reason, in my opinion, why there are so many accidents and road rage incidents. there is no connection to the outside world, and the driver loses the sense of responsibility that comes with driving a two tonne, potentially lethal piece of metal at high velocity. the solution in most cases would be the pedal cycle; it takes up little road space, is non polluting, has positive health benefits for the rider, does not deplete the planet of natural resources and does not take up parking spaces which can cause further congestion. however, journeys over about 7 miles become difficult as one begins to exert substantial physical effort and perspiration follows- not all destianations have changing facilities or showers.  THE ANSWER...   a motorcycle, like this bad boy.  Benefits; extremely fuel efficient, takes up little road space and has less impact on road surfaces, easy to park, fast, provides a connection with the outside world- such that most riders take the responsibility given by the power of the machine seriously and endeavour to ride safely at all times (the majority of motorcycle injuries are caused by careless car drivers not paying due attention to their surroundings).  Ive decided. Im going to buy me a motorbike. A big noisy one like the one above, so that everyone can hear me coming (noisy bikes save lives, car drivers in a world of their own are suddenly snapped out of their day dreams by throbbing engine). im gonna religiously save £130 a month out of my measly £460 NHS bursary. in about 2 years time i reckon i should have enough to get myself a reasonably reliable, nearly new, big-ass cruiser style bike, which i will be able to commute long distances on. i could go for a cheaper option but its a false economy because i dont want to be spending on repairs all the time and i want something that will be able to put the miles in. its a long term, slow burner of a plan and im gonna have to make sacrifices- like when i go out- not buying rounds but getting my own and watching how much i drink (you would not believe how much i spend on the average nite out, and i always end up subsidising the majority of the taxi fare home), and not rushing out to buy the latest CD ive heard is any good. i will keep yous updated as to how my savings scheme is working out.

      ....is Charlotte Hatherley from Ash?    hummana, hummana, hummana..... oooooohhhhhhhh yesh.      wow. she be hot. very very very hot. och aye. apparently she used to be in a band called nightnurse. man, would i like her to be  my  night nurse. shes recorded a solo album according to todays metro news (probably the best paper in the world), which featured a v.nice photo of her, looking particularly nymphish.  on a related note, how fit is hilary woods from JJ72? with the added bonus that she is Oirish and therefore would be able to give tremendous fone sex as well.     well its a tough choice but i reckon charlotte just edges it. hilary reminds me a tiny little bit of my sister, and also i reckon she has a little bit of a twitch or something going on. but just to make sure id have to take them both into a darkened room at the same time and see what happened.

          pretty good day at work today, after the shitter that was yesterday. actually did a bit of learning, and completed a whole discharge by myself- i even came up with an idea for a discharge "check list" form- this seemed to impress the boss, as she loves forms and the filling in thereof. so if i actually do a draft form and try to get it implemented i reckon it will be pretty impressive for my report. also managed to get a whole load of my competences signed off. and had an extra long morning break. and finished early.   got an email saying my Isle of Wight festival tickets have been dispatched. corkin. lookin forward to it now. the delays are playing, they are super cool. also charlatans who are v.good. stereophonics too, but i dont like them that much. shud be good. camping. havent tested out my tent in "combat action" as yet, so will be interestin to see how it goes. got it at a bargain knockdown price last summer when i planned to go on a cycling tour round scotalnd or spain but i ran out of cash so didnt go.

      sheet.  was on placement today, so up bright and early at 5.20am. Got home this evenin at 5.40pm. suffice to say im knackered, but i'll tell ya about my day anyhoo....  well, somebody died on my ward in the early hours, so i got to carry out "last offices", which basically means washing the body and putting it in a shroud, wrapping it up and sorting out all the bubbins ready to send it away to the mortuary. nice start to the day. not really. bit freaky to be honest, especially when leagage occurs.  rest of the day was spent carrying out cleaning, and doing bits and bobs like fetching the commode, taking out venflons, making beds, carrying stuff. I cant wait till i qualify cuz i'll be able to make excuses about not being able to do basic patient care cuz i'll be "bogged down" in paperwork.  All the staff nurses moan about having to write loads of stuff. i wish. anything to be able to sit at a desk all day instead of cleaning shit off peoples backsides and running about answering bells.  went to radiotherapy this avo to watch someone having treatment but due to the inept porters (whom i had to wait three quarters of an hour for) i didnt finish my shift until 10 to four (should have gone home at 3.30). if i tried to claim this time back off tommorows shift i would get arsey comments about being petty and it being only 20 mins- but heres the thing they dont seem to understand I DONT GET PAID! i get a measly f*cking bursary to cover living costs. no overtime, no nothin. those arseh@les get 18k a year, so they can afford to give some of their own time.  journey home was a piss take. bus in to cov took forever, missed train by 10 seconds, then bus to my house from station was stuck in traffic for ages, cuz of all the selfish drivers in massive estate cars with no passengers takin up too much room on the roads.  soz for the rant. but im in a take no prisoners sort of mood this evenin.  laters.

      anyone heard about the transit of Venus? its happening on the 8th June, when venus will come directly between the sun and earth, and you will be able to see it moving across the sun. http://www.transit-of-venus.org.uk/transit.htm  this is pretty cool because it hasnt happened for over 120 years. it will happen again in 8 years time but after that not for another 105 years. There is no person alive today who has seen this before.  Captain Cook wouldnt have discovered Australia if it werent for the transit of Venus. Captain Cook is another one of my heros, ive read loads of books about him and his journals and stuff. anyway. The whole purpose of his first voyage around the globe was to observe the transit of Venus in 1769, in order to help establish the distance of the earth from the sun. It needed to be seen from several locations across the globe and Cook was chosen to lead the expedition to Tahiti.  History guys. its good stuff.

      went to work thurs, fri, sat. completely knackered. lates followed by early shifts, gives me about 8 hours in the house- 7 of which are allocated to sleep. so have basically had no time to write anything. the commute is now turning into a joke. saturday morning the train was cancelled and replaced by a bus service because of engineering works. engineering works will be going on from now until july sometime, so reduced services etc, but the fun really starts over the bank holiday weekend when there will be no trains to Cov at all. i left work on sat at 3.30pm (after working through my break on a nitemare shift) got home 5.40. not impressed.  good nite out last nite tho. we bundled on over to Cov in my mates car. few pubs followed by the colluseum. stayed over at the Hilton hotel (for free) where said mate works. top notch. must do it again.

      okay. so everyone has a dream right? what they wanna do, where they wanna be in ten years time. well this is mine.  fingers crossed i should qualify as a nurse in 2006. Hopefully i will come out with a pretty good degree, but if it all goes pear shaped i could end up with a diploma, i can still practice and even get up to management grades it just takes a bit longer. Once i qualify i want to work either in Cov or Bham for a year or two- just to get some cash in the bank and get some add on skills that you can only get once qualified, such as IV assessment and bloods. also if i do end up with a diploma i will take my degree modules to top up, part time while workin. I will probly decide what department i want to specialise in and see who will have me, because i need to build up my experience for the second part of my plan....    ....emigrating to Australia. this is the biggy. i want to get a residence visa in Australia and work over there as a nurse. They have a similar system to over here, and i wont have to take any conversion exams or owt. Also they have a nursing shortage just like we do, so hopefully it wont be too hard for me to get in. im dreaming of the gold coast or maybe Perth. I dont mind working in a big city for a while, just till i adapt to the culture and job. it will be easier finding a job and place to live, but eventually id like to live out in the country a bit- have a bit of land to grow veggys, have a pool and some chickens.  i would like to retire back in europe. either in italy or spain. have a house on a mountainside a couple of miles from the nearest village, with a terraced veggy plot system, a fruit orchard, some vines and a massive wood fired pizza oven. i would also keep a donkey      id call him dave and he'd help me bring my shopping up from the village.

      today was pretty hot. went into uni for my one and three quarter hour lecture. last in the module. got a coupla ideas for my essay on care plans, but a bit of a waste of time overall. over 2 hours total commute time. well at least it got me out of the house and i got a chance to catch up with my uni buddies. we went for a drink afterwards and chewed the hay.  i must say a little thank you to Mr Michael Fish for making the weather turn out so nice, and a special thank you goes out to all the lovely ladies of coventry, who provided such an excellent display this afternoon.

      ... Lance Armstrong.       Five times tour de France winner.  I cannot overestimate how tough professional cyclists are. these guys ride over a hundred miles a day during the tour de france and it lasts about a month.  Now lets put this in perspective. I like riding, and do it a lot. i can manage about 60 miles a day at the mo without collapsing in utter exhaustion. this is with breaks and at no great pace, on the flat. i could do about 20 at full race pace. your average Joe on the street probly couldnt do more than 10 miles on a bike without dying. it takes training.  Now these guys are doing over 100 miles PER DAY, at RACE PACE, UP MOUNTAINS in the Pyrenees and Alps, for a month with only a couple of rest days in the whole race. it has been described as the toughest endurance race of all time. people have died just doing single hill climbs in the Alps on bikes, because they are that tough. let alone doing it day after day after day as part of a race. i dont know how i can explain how hard it is. You think of a hill near you, and see how hard it is to climb it on a bike. now imagine that hill was twice as steep and over 30 miles long... and thats just one part of one days race in the tour.  and why is Lance so special; yeah hes won it five times and is going for his sixth this year- but what makes it amazing is he won all these races after coming back from cancer that the docs said would kill him. He had lung cancer that metastesised to his brain. and he fookin beat it. he had chemo and came back to win the hardest race in the world 5 times.  Legend.

      ...ride your bicycleet. as finlay quaye used to sing. its another glorious day, so seeing as ive got no uni or work, thought id get the old steed out and ride her hard through the warwickshire countryside. Havent been out on the bike for about a month due to shite workin hours, essays and going out and feeling sick the morning after. was all geared up and ready to go. started my pre-ride checklist; water, keys, banana, flapjack, spare tube, multitool, mini pump, tyre pressure, brakes.... shit front brake not working... shit rear not working... cant fix either cuz its the cables that have gone and im a poor mechanic. gutted. wouldve had an ace day.   This is a pic of my bike. her name is juliet. she is a 2001 Bianchi gold race 600. bottom of the range, its all i could afford at the time and cost me 600 odd quid. she has served me well but her cheap componants are starting to wear. She is an Italian bike with Campagnolo shifters. she handles well and does the job. i dont often race her but have ridden with a club, and she keeps up well with the flash harrys on their £3k cock extensions. As the great man Lance said "its not about the bike". Anyway took her to my favoured bike shop for repairs but they are so busy ive had to book her in for next wednesday, which means all this good weather will probly be gone by the time shes fixed. all the other shops round here are staffed by morons who only sell mountain bikes. i would love to get me a new bike. have had my eyes on a principia or an orbea (theyre made in the basque country and ridden by one of my heros- Iban Mayo), but a half decent one would set me back a grand and a half minimum. money i just dont have. im trying to save up for a motorbike so i dont have to get up so early for work (currently takes me 1.5 hrs- bus, train, bus). its going to take me 12 months at predicted save-age rates to scrimp the money together for that. and i always end up spending my savings on something else that comes along. ah well... still havent checked my lottery tickets.

      couple of things i thought id show you while im thinking about it. heres a picture of columbos dog.   Its name is "dog" because thats what it answers to. hes a basset hound. we often find him in or around columbos classic Peugeut car. both attract comments.  this is a picture of the t-shirt i was wearing last night.   thats not me in the picture by the way, thats a model. although i would quite like his hair.  this is pretty much what my hair looks like right now

      well yesterday was alright. went the match, we lost 2-0 but not too bothered, caught up with my old mate jon- got his businesscard- god everyone is growing up now, two of my mates have just bought houses, and one is planning on getting married. went to mosely last nite, which was good and then ended up in the academy in town which was not so good as i didnt intend on going and spent far too much money for a bit of an average nite. got ok twards the end as i decided to get wasted. the music was a bit shit but the company was good on the whole, and you'll dance to anything come 1.30. aaaaaanyway... the original point of this post was to say that i am in the process of growing my hair. at the moment its at an irritating stage where i cant do owt with it and it just looks wrong. i have been shaving my hair reel short, like number 3 or summat, cuz i used to do a hell of a lot of cycling last year and it was more practical (less wind resistance, cooler) and i guess i was just lazy, short hair being easy to wash and you dont need to style it. now i want it long and shaggy. right now i cant even spike it properly. it seems like its taking ages to grow back though- watched pot and all that i guess.

      quick one. im off to the game in a bit. watching the footy- villa vs man utd, last game of the season. not really that into the footy anymore, i used to go when i was a kid, had a season ticket and everything. only been about 3 times this season, but its a good chance to catch up with one of my old muckers from school days whos now living in london. will most likely update you on the scores/events tommorow. but maybe not cuz im off out tonight, and may be in no fit state to face the world in the morning. pub crawl round mosely village, perhaps followed by a trip into one of birminghams many happenin nite spots.

      i like to get about a bit, and in the past ive had a coupla adventures. i will now endeavour to add some pictures and talk you through them.    This is me aged 18, at uni in Lancs after getting trollied one night and letting the guys in my halls paint my face (in the colours of Aston Villa apparently), we then went to the kebab shop, 'Popeyes' to show the general public how cool we were. oh those heady days of youth.    These are some lazy ass kangaroos that i encountered while travelling in Australia. The place is full of them. you cant walk down the road without tripping over sleeping kangaroos or squelching a lost joey underfoot.  when i get time i like to visit my sister who lives in Scarborough. a quality place cuz its got a beach and loads of countryside around it, such as the moores- quality bike riding territory.   they should move birmingham up to the coast, but then everyone would want to live there.  a while back my mate went to work in Gibraltar for a while, so i hopped on a bus, a plane, and two more buses to visit him for a bit and check out "the rock". this is a pic of me at the top.   i like it, cuz although its cold, wet and windy i am pleasantly warmed by the thought of monkeys over yonder. much hilarity was had as i fed one of the barbary monkeys a piece of chocolate and it literally went "ape shit", scaring the bejeezus out of my buddies who were travellin with me.  on the way to 'Gib', as i like to call it, we stopped off in spain which is full of cool stuff like this here piece of art  i couldnt tell if it was supposed to be a dove or a hand, but thats the beauty of art, so i shook the hand, fed it some trill and was on my way.  ive had many more adventures but not all with my camera in tow. im sure i will be of a mind to relate some of them to y'all in time, but for now- stay true and stick it to the man

      columbo is the best televisual programme ever created, its even better than neighbours. In case anyone doesnt know, columbo is a murder detective show, staring Peter Falk as the seemingly bumbling Lieutenant Columbo. It ranged from the late sixties all the way upto the late 90's on and off. each episode (or T.V movie) lasted about an hour and a half with the basic formula of a murder at the start, (usually we the viewers are privvy to whodunnit), then columbo comes in and digs and digs until he gets enough evidence to put the killer away. simple eh? not so. there is never any violence and little "action", where columbo succeeds is in the brilliance of the storylines (real sleuth style scripts)and the characterisation of columbo played by the impeccable Falk. The quirkiness of the lieutenant (we never learn his first name)provides the comedy which is subtle and all the better for it. There is a tremendous back story which is well maintained. above all the habits and manerisms of columbo never cease to keep me giggling.  here is a list of some of the idiosyncrasies you should watch out for next time columbo is shown on T.V.:  "just one more thing..."  he looks astounded by some "new" piece of technology, like the VCR.  he mentions his wife  he gets an autograph/souveneir for her.  he wants to take up the profession of the person he's talking to  he gives some lame excuse why he hasnt taken up the  profession,     like "...but my thumbs are too big".  he uses the phrase "just tying up loose ends"  he refers to the "boys downtown" as being "real strict".  he uses the phrase "just a formality".  he uses the phrase "sorry to bother you".  he gets mistaken for a tramp, and then introduced as the leader of the investigation.  he expresses cultural patheticness (like mentioning in an art gallery that his wife is a painter, and then mentioning how she gets the "ones with the numbers on them that you paint with the right colors").  he rubs his bottom eyelid with his index finger.  he gets a phone call at someone else's house/office  there are tonnes more but my favourite is his way with food- just watch it and you'll know what i mean!

      im a "dirty veggy" as one of my mates likes to put it, but i do eat fish, which perplexes some- but there is a logic to it; i dont eat meat cuz the faarmers are bad (not all of 'em, just the ones who supply the supermarkets). animals are kept in shite conditions (ive got plenty stories about chickens- pecking each other to death and burning in their own faeces and urea) and they pump 'em full of chemicals (whats that white stuff that froffs up when you cook bacaon? dems the antibiotics), aaaaanyway- the fishes, they swims in the sea all day- happy as larry (and i dont eat farmed fish- lice on salmon- a whole other story). im not a militant veggy to be honest and often have lapses (perhaps once every 2 months or so), its the idea of the farming that does it for me. i mean id happily eat a cow if id shot it myself in the wild and knew itd had a happy life and all. its natural and everything for us to eat meat, but raising a cow for the sole purpose of killing it, pumpin it full of chemicals and stuff- just bad.

      hi, im bob. im taking a sicky off work today, for the first time in ages. im actually a student nurse, so its not real work as i dont get paid for it, but i wouldnt call cleaning shit off a pensioners backside anything but hard work. aaaaanyway... thought id try this blogging thing out, see if its any good. my uni course encourages reflection through writing a diary, so this might be an alternative way to go about it. That'll do for now, dont want to write too much in case i balls it up and this entry doesnt post correctly. i'll get the hang of it shortly im sure.

      food.  i am a veggy, but i do have the occasional lapse. never at home, mostly when im out and have had a few drinks, or if there is absolutely nothing else to eat. i do all my own cooking. Im a big fan of Italian food. i make my own pizza from scratch- flour, water, yeast touch of salt and sugar for the base. they turn out quality all of the time. I also make loads of pasta sauces. Pasta is probably the main constituent of my diet. i tend to make a huge batch of pasta sauce and freeze a lot of it in batches for when i get in late from work- then all you have to do is microwave it and put the pasta on to boil for 10 mins.  i like most foods and am willing to try anything. i love spanish cooking. i like the indian style as well. not so keen on chinese, but now and again its ok. i like to try out new grains and starch alternatives like bulgar wheat, wild rice, quinoa and maize. im increasingly fond of seafood- good heart benefits, but only 2 portions a week due to all that mercury level gubbins theyve been talkin about. with this in mind and being a veggy i eat a good variety of nuts and pulses in order to keep my protein levels up. i especially like our native hazelnut and also the brazil nut. i try to eat a good mix of beans as they are especially good for you- kidney beans, cannallini, borlotti, butter beans, black eye, haricot and chick peas.  i love my fruit. i endeavour to eat my five portions a day. as well as all the usuals (apples, oranges, pears, bananas) i love kiwis, peaches, plums and especially summer fruits like blackberries, redcurrants and blackcurrants. blueberries are a fave mainly when frozen cuz they have a better zing than when fresh. i have a spoonful of native honey every day. This is to build up my immunity to local pollens and so help my hayfever. honey also has tonnes of antioxidants and is really good for your immune system. i buy it from a local beekeeper in North Yorkshire so i know its pure. The stuff you buy in the supermarkets aint British. its usually a mix of different refined honeys from Argentina, Mexico and Australia.   i have a penchant for the potato crisp. i know they are bad for me but they tempt me so. yes they have a high salt content, a high fat content (25-35%) and loads of E-number preservatives- but they taste so good. At the moment i am loving Sea salt and Balsamic vinegar Kettle chips.    i also love all golden wonder crisps. Monster Munch, pickled onion being one of my all time faves.  Flavour wise i like salt and vinegar, pickled onion, worcester sauce, tomato sauce and prawn cocktail, but i do experiment with spicy ranges now and again. i most definately do not like cheese and onion. ready salted, chicken and beef flavours are also out of favour. theres a brand of crisps that i love, but they only seem to sell them up north and i cant remember the name, but they do loads of good flavours. i'll ask my sister and get back to you- she lives in scarborough.

      more getting to know you stuff- often people ask "what do you drink then bob?" well generally when out with my mates its pints of lager, mostly because its what everyone else is drinking so its easier to remember the order and fairer when paying for rounds. I dont like carling as it tastes like metal. any other lager is fine, but i prefer Nastro Azzuro, Italian premium imported, touch of class. or if having bottles i dont mind sol. i dont really have a great liking for beer in all honestly though. id much prefer a short and mixer, cuz beer makes you feel so bloated and you have to go for a wazz every 20 mins. they also all taste much of a muchness and are very calorific. however shorts can be expensive, dont last very long, get you wasted too quick and arent very masculine when watching the footy or summat. i do like a nice southern comfort with lemonade and a slice of lime. if planning to get very wasted i like snakebite and black (half lager, half cider with a shot of blackcurrent cordial). this gets you extremely drunk, extremely quickly, and stops all inhibitions on the nite, and all memory the following morning. much like voka and coke from snobs.     The dudes drink of choice is of course the white russian. Ingredients: 1.0 part  Coffee Liqueur (kahlua)              1.0 part  Milk/light cream              1.0 part  Vodka Method: mix the vodka and kahlua together and pour over ice, float the cream on top.    i never drink alcohol at home or with a meal. Those are the golden rules. Generally never before 3pm either. At home i drink tap water (pints), fresh orange/apple juice, the occasional glass of milk and the odd cup of tea now and again. im not a fan of coffee and i dont drink fizzy drinks as a rule.

      came 3rd in the quiz yesterday. damn it, the teams ahead of us had 7 and 5 people, we were only 3- we could easily kick ass if more people turned up. Next week we shall have the last laugh however, as its going to be a general knowledge quiz, not a pop quiz. lets just say i know a lot of stuff. i watch plenty of quiz shows and have the kind of mind which stores up facts good.  whats annoying me at the moment? when people sit behind you in a lecture talking absolute crap. and saying the word "like" in every single sentence.  what am i looking forward to? The tour de france. this saturday.    The route Running from Saturday July 3rd to Sunday July 25th, the 2004 Tour de France will be made up of one prologue and 20 stages and will cover a total distance of 3,390 kilometres.  These 20 stages have the following profiles: * 11 flat stages, * 6 mountain stages, * 2 individual time-trial stages, * 1 team time-trial stage.   Distinctive aspects of the race * 3 mountain finishes, * 2 rest days, * 75 kilometres of individual time-trials, * 65 kilometres of team time-trials, * 1 transfer by plane and 1 transfer by train (TGV), * 21 Category 1, Category 2 and highest level passes will be climbed, * 7 new stop-over towns: Waterloo, Cambrai, Chartres, Lamballe, Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat, Guéret, Annemasse.

      i was just having a read of someone elses blog. a nurse, like wot im trying to be, but from america. he was talking about how he coped with a dying patient and their family. it just got me to thinking about what im doing. sometimes my placement feels like just another job- youve gotta get up, get in and get the day over as quickly as possible. but then at other times its so much more. you make a real difference to peoples lives. like the other day when i went out of my way to talk to a guy whos wife has cancer, i listened to him for i dont know how long as he was so unsure as to what was going on with the treatment, and then i went and looked in her medical notes and nursing notes, got him some other information and phone numbers of people he could talk to, and chatted to him again. He was so appreciative. and that makes all the sheet you have to take worth it. at times i cant see the bigger picture, i just look in my diary and groan at the early shift ive gotta do next sunday. and at others all i can think about is the long term goals; qualifying, moving to Oz, specialising, doing volunteer work for MSF when ive got the experiance under my belt. life man. just thinking about it.

      im so hardcore. i had to get up at 5am on sat to go to work. i did a 12 hour shift, followed by a two hour bus journey home (trains cancelled- engineering work), didnt have any tea, and i still had the energy to go to my best mans housewarming party. AG is my best man, im his best man. thats the deal. when i eventually get married he'll be the dude sortin stuff out. when he gets married (possibly in the not so distant future), i will be organising the stag etc, which i already have embryonic plans for. party was cool. woeful music though, as is usually the case at these things.  13.7

      in the words of alan hanson- shockin! watchin the footy last nite was a real heart wrenching feast of emotions. watched it at my mate AGs new house, with his crazy wolf hound dog howling in the background, in-between bouts of chasing its tail and chewing peoples arms in its footlong mouth. it was good watchin it with the lads as they really appreciate the finer points of the game and it all adds to the atmosphere. and in the words of nearly everyone i have seen interviewed about the match- gutted!  heads up!- the tour de france starts on 3rd July and goes on until 25th. more updates to follow.  ive opened an online betting account with William Hill. but do not worry, i will not become a gambling addict. ive only put £10 in, and will quit when that runs out. my bets are never more than 25pence each, and im just betting on stuff like Villa to win the league. just a bit of fun. i know my limits. my grandad used to be a gambler and my nan has told me stories about how she had to pawn his suit during the week till he got paid. so im not gettin into that situation.     just in case anyone had forgotten how great the mighty delays are. go out and buy their album, or get me to copy it for you. class.

      how weird is Coventry? or as they refer to it 'Cov'. the more time i spend in the place the more i find peculiarities, but they arent so conspicuous or obvious that you will pick up on them straight away. Ive lived in various places and travelled far and wide, and you always get local sayings and ways of life that seem odd but it is in Coventry, a city not more than ten miles from my place of birth, that these foibles have begun to weird me out.  it started with me noticing the Warickshire towns obsession with the their local symbols- lady godiva(who rode naked thru the town), the elephant (on the cities coat of arms) and the phoenix (symbolising how cov rose from the ashes of the blitz).  there is not a cab company, take away or pub in coventry that does not have the word phoenix or godiva in its name. i think that local by-law must state that all new small businesses feature such a word when registering their name. also every other street name conforms to this law. the elephant features prominantly in sign-age and bollards (they all have a little elephant on top).   "do you know what i mean?" -lots of places use this phrase but in this town its said in such a rapid manner you might not even notice it. in fact they all talk exceptionally fast in coventry. another funny thing about the way they talk is that people from coventry genuinly believe that they dont have an accent- of any shape or form. of course they do. yes, i know most people dont recognise that they themselves have an accent but generally they  will admit that there is a regional accent for their area- all people in Coventry deny that there is a coventry accent.  they also have a good deal of phrases and idiosyncratic word usage in cov. i cant think of any right now, i will update you as and when they come to mind but my good mate ste will back me up on this issue- himself noting the line "box it off", when refering to something that needs doing.  another point. how freakish people around the place look. ive suddenly started noticing how everyone is just a little bit wrong. I live in Bham so im experianced in spotting the dodgy person in the crowd, and you'd think id be used to it. But Cov doesnt just have an above average quota of scallies, drunks, crazies and nuts- every, and i mean every person in the town has that 'special' look about them in some way.

      i did my first 12 hour shift at work yesterday. boy. it was pretty tough, but then so's an 8 hour- and i keep the pleasant thought in my head that i get an extra day off for doing it. plus it saves so much travel time. i reckon the hardest bit about work is actually getting out of bed and getting in on time. the shift did drag a bit especially in the middle 4 hours.  anyway. thought id do another little blog about me, and specifically about my musical tastes. Unlike a lot of clueless people who when asked what type of music they like answer "oh, a bit of everything", when actually they mean chart sheet, i have a very specific taste. i dont like much outside my genre. i like 'indie' music, which is basically guitar based bands, in the student style that grew up in britain in the late 1980's early 90's with the rise of groups like the stone roses. often called alternative, although this word is used to describe many other styles nowadays. right. im going to list some of the bands i like (this list is by no means extensive);   the bluetones, embrace, delays, charlatans, the stone roses, idlewild, mercury rev, snow patrol, the thrills, muse, REM, soulwax, badly drawn boy, haven, easyworld, chris T-T, turin breaks, JJ72, ash, coldplay, mull historical society, the longpigs, ooberman, sleeper, echobelly, ben folds five, fountains of wayne, doves, hefner, crashland, captain soul, travis, lowgold, the mock turtles, pavement, weezer, i am kloot, goldrush, the flaming lips, belle and sebastian, aqualung, ed harcourt, minuteman, teenage fanclub, spearmint, electric soft parade, the shins, the zutons, the coral, kings of convenience, the lemonheads, the stills, the strokes, third eye blind, the wannadies, the crescent, the boo radleys, keane, tompaulin, 60ft dolls, gay dad, mansun, ocean colour scene, supergrass, the killers, the beta band, feeder, stereophonics, gomez, super furry animals, the verve, manic street preachers, kula shaker, pulp, interpol, the cardigans.  thats just off the top of my head.   13.8

         i bought this album the other day, at a bargainous £4, i paid £3.60 with NUS discount from HMV. sweet. id forgotten how much of a legend Rolf is. Not just the music (think of how many tracks you know- loads) but the art, the cartoons, the writing, the TV presenting- hes a genius. We've grown up with him. What a guy.

      its that time of year again. the beeb have gone crazy. yes the BBC are the best broadcasters in the world but come the end of june they always make the same mistake- cancelling neighbours for 2 whole weeks and showing the tennis from wimbledon on both BBC1 and 2 nearly all day long. Why they dont realise that not everybody is interested in the tennis i dont know.its on from abnout 9 till 6, then they show a highlights package then later at night another one. its overkill. i cant praise the beeb enough for their footy coverage- ten times better than ITV. the pundits are quality- Wrighty, Hanson and Scmeichal provide a mix of comedy, sense and insight.  a moments silence to mourn the passing of my sideburns. i shaved them off at the end of last week due to the increasing number of "quips" from the philistine and fashion ignorant members of staff and patients at work. do not worry. they will be back. as my hair evolves into an ever longer mop, the sideburns shall emerge like a phoenix from the flames. they look a bit conspicuous with short hair, so when i get a bit more length over the ears i will bring them back.

      i finally christened my new running shoes this morning. i bought them about a month ago, but have not been out for a jog since, for various reasons including work, weather, hangovers and plain laziness. thought id take the opportunity on this fine, clear and cool sunday morning to break them in gently. i only ran about a mile and paced myself very slowly. i was still knackered at the end of it. i feel a bit less guilty now ive actually used them. i wont run at night because its too dangerous around here- too many scally kids hanging about. and its a bit hot in the middle of the day since its summer. that only leaves early mornings, and when ive a day off work i would generally prefer a lie in or will have a hangover from the nite before. but ive got flabby since starting uni- been going out more, and with work im struggling to eat properly- i looked at a coupla pics from my spanish holiday before i started at Cov, and i look pretty skinny, but at the mo i would be embarassed to take my shirt off in company, so i need to do something. am planning to join a gym but the council one is a bit pikey- full of people wearing gold, and to join a private one would be too expensive with me saving for my bike. im full of excuses.

      my god. im tired. and i hate reading other peoples blogs when all they have to say is how tired they are from work and how they really havent got much to say cuz theyve been at work for ages. those type of posts are even worse to read than people blogging about god or java script, and only slightly better than teenage angst women and people tying to be clever by writing in obscure song lyric references. so im not gonna do that. instead i shall post some more isle of wight pics. cuz a picture is worth loads of words, so they say.    above is a picture of the ferry that ferried us from southampton to the magical isle. it was called osprey or hawk or summat. the foreground features JPs torso, we were all lying quayside in the beautiful sunshine, feeding the seagulls.    this is me playing at a form of sword in the stone with a mooring ring at the dockside. i'll leave you to guess if i succeeded in pulling it out.    to prove it wasnt just me who looked cool in the sombrero here is bec sporting the mexican headgear. and below JP- even he can pull it off (notice the apparition on his left).

      okay. ive just picked my pictures up from the developers of our jaunt to the isle of wight festival. Im not at my own house so have only scanned a couple in. the england match is on in a bit so this is just a quicky, more photos to follow in a couple of days, but this is just to be getting on with.    okay, this is me with the mallett and sombrero -already looking a bit sozzled, but it aint the beer, i swear guvnor, its the heat and lack of sleep that are making me look like some sort of crazy.    and above is my good mate JP (chin) sporting the dukes of hazard tee, in front of a load of tents.     me and chin in our tent.    me and chin in front of our tent.    me and chin with all our stuff by the quay-side in Cowes before the long journey home.

      just booked my CBT (compulsory basic training), for the motorbike. cool. it was dead easy and they were ever so nice on the fone. only cost £110 for everything- bike hire for the day, leathers, gloves. its guaranteed pass- if i mess up i will have to come in for another days training. its for 125cc training which means bikes with gears- none of your lame ass moped sheet. glad ive got it booked and paid for, as it means its no longer one of my many pipe dreams- its actually getting moving. and since ive told nearly everyone i know that im gonna get myself a bike, i will look pretty stoopid if i dont get one. its a way off yet- august 4th- but thats the only time i know ive definately got 2 days off work in a row. i cant afford a bike until at least the end of august anyway.  right. ive put the isle o wight photies in for development, they should be ready to pick up tommorow, dont know if i'll have time to put them up here straight away cuz its a pretty busy day- i got uni and its the england match.  ive just remembered ive got library books overdue. looked on the website. the fine is currently £4.80. i think it will be another quid tommorow.   morisseys new song is ok- first of the gang. just heard it on radio. desperately want the new Ash album but ive gotta cut down on buying stuff in order to get my bike. just got an email saying theres gonna be a new Embrace album out and i want the new Charlotte Hatherley album too. why is there so much good music out at the mo?

      i got back from the isle of wight just over an hour ago. im pretty knackered, so this is just a quick taster of what went on. i will update when i get time, theres a fair bit of news, but i might be a little busy the next coupla days. i will also post some photos when i get them developed. it was extremely hot all weekend, not a spot of rain, temperatures in the mid-twenties celcius. a long journey there and back including a fun ferry ride. adventures camping in a field with lots of noisy fellow festival goers. an absolute feast of quality bands. some extortionately priced food vendors. queues for water. stinky lavatories. sleep deprivation. many hot ladies, walking around looking hot. crowds and crowds of people. sunstroke. intrigued? you'll just have to wait.

      im off to the isle of wight tommorow morning, for the festival . so probably wont be able to keep up the blog for the next 4 days or so.  should be a pretty ace weekend except for the journey down there on the coach, reckon it will be hot. lookin forward to it mucho. not sure about david bowie, but the rest of the line up is pretty sorted; snow patrol, the mighty delays, charlatans and stereophonics. just tried my tent out in the back garden and its in good order. good day at uni today. got an essay back. quality mark- 70%, which is pretty damn good for a uni assignment. blew everyone else i know out of the water, but i didnt make a big thing of it cuz theyd think i was an arse. secretly dead chuffed though. also invited the fittest girl on my course to sit next to me during the second half of lecture. we have a mutual friend, and shes really cool to chat to. she is married though. literally. shes way out of my league anyhow. but one can still have dreams. nice to have her as a friend.

      the following is a set of weird coincidence type things that have been happening to me lately. first of all i bought a pack of dried mushrooms for a risotto i planned to make. the same day i heard a programme on the radio about "urban mushroom farming", this guy grows mushrooms on a massive scale on an urban farm under the M25 in London. the next day i heard a programme on the same radio station about road humps, and how in one belgian city the interviewee said, they were "springing up all over the place like a kind of urban mushroom". then at work today, a patient could not manage to eat his dinner, so i offered him some soup- guess what flavour he asked for.... fookin mushroom! this has freaked me out somewhat.

      phil collins. lets face it. wrong. if i even hear one bar of a phil collins (or Genesis for that matter) song on the radio i will dive acrooss the room and beat the said wireless with a hammer.   tonights episode of neighbours. well not all of it obviously, since it is the 2nd best TV show of all time. just the scene with sky and boyd stuck in one lift and karl and izzy stuck in another. and specifically the background music. they were gettin hot and sweaty, as you do, one can imagine, when stuck in a lift in Oz. anyway, so the implication is that both couples start to get it on. fine. nowt wrong yet. but then instead of the usual generic neighbours lovey dovey music they played a Craig David track as backing. not right.  Golf.  Dance, trance, techno, hard house.  Eastenders; cockneys on TV. speaking cockney, acting cockney. incorrect. Coronation street. Its on every night and then on sundays. twice. with eastenders in between. sweet baby jesus and the orphans! how can people sit thru such drivel? i would shoot myself rather than watching a night of british soaps. with a low impact gun, with a rusty bullet soaked in vinegar, for maximum pain and in the leg so that id slowly bleed to death.

      madre de dios! as they say in spain and parts of latin america. man alive. my head is aching. went out to the academy in bham last nite, via the sunflower (best indie pub in brum). my bezzy mate spunky D was back in town. hes just finished uni and is off to the states. here is a pic of me and him at malaga bus station.     we go way back. so had to have a good send off. too ill to go into work today. hopefully no reprecussions cuz i didnt fone in. was a pretty good nite. got absolutely trollied, but youre only young once. at least i think im still young. the 5 people immediately in front of us in the queue for the club got asked for id and refused entry. we must all look old cuz none of us did. we just got let in. mustve been a good nite. i dont remember a thing after the second snakebite. probly danced like a fool. no action. i did find a massive stick on the way home, which is now in my room.

         birmingham. its wonderful. thought id put up a few pics, to give a bit of context to where i live. just in case anybody who may be reading this hasnt been to birmingham (or b'ham as its sometimes abbreviated and brum as its known to locals).    above is the fluzzie in the jacuzzie with the council house in the background. not many people know this but its real name is "the river" and its supposed to represent the life force of the city. interesting. and below is a WM travel bus. they are some classy vehicles. especially on the top deck of a saturday nite.

      carrots are shooting up. onions continue on their slow but steady growth rate. american spinach is growing v.quick but is getting blackfly attacks pretty regularly. the salad crop is doing ok. giant mustard and rocket are being picked and continuously planted, but the american cress and pak choi havent even sprouted. herbs are coming on nicely, should pick up as the sun comes out a bit more. on the fruit score. the blueberries have flowered and it looks like a very small crop will form this year. not surprised. they take a few years to fruit normally. same with the cherry tree. the apple tree is much too immature and not even flowering. the grape vines are fairly established and the kiwi is almost uncontrolable. updates to follow as summer progresses.

      as you may be able to tell from todays multitude of postings, its my day off. although "technically" its not my day off because im a student and when on "placement" i am considered "supernumary", not counted in the staffing levels, im really only there to learn. but thats a load of balls. im used and abused. well, the only way to learn is to get stuck in, but sometimes it feels like theyre taking the pee, cuz as i keep saying- i dont get paid. if they need more staff, they shud employ them- not rely on the students as free labour. its a balancing act. and with the managers on our ward i would be suprised if theyve ever done a course in man management at all. different people respond to different things to get them motivated. i, for instance would prefer to be taken to one side and quietly explained to if i did something wrong. i wouldnt do it again, and id buck my ideas up. If i was told in front of other people it would make me pissed off.  anyway... i was gonna post about something different. Good news. As from next week its two days a week at uni, 3 days on the wards. HAPPY DAYS. and ive just found out that in the 3rd year i get a full 6 month stretch at uni with no placement. cool. from september i'll only be doing 7 weeks on placemnet followed by 7 weeks at uni. and i will be in all different wards and hospitals and stuff. corkin.  i got a coupla quick book recomendations. At the mo im reading Fat Wars by Ellen Shell, the inside story of the obesity industry. a topic that really interests me. is it our own fault if we are fat? not such an easy question if you look deep into it. The love hexagon by William Sutcliffe. he's done a few good books. easy to read. good for the beach. along the same lines is Stretch 29 by D.Lanigan. about a 20-something bloke and his love life etc. trashy lad lit really.  that'll do for now. neighbours is on in a bit. make myself some lunch first. dunno whats in.

      ooooh. its a toughy. you see it depends what mood your in doesnt it? sometimes its just gotta be peanut butter and jam (sunpat creamy crunch with robinsons strawberry). but then theres equally a time for the classic cheese and pickled onion. in my meaty days i used to like corned beef and brown sauce (HPs) or a salami/pastrami choice if available from a take out place. increasingly im favouring philedelphia cream cheese on plain white, to take to work, wrapped in foil.  must give some respect though to the mighty Subway. the fastest growing convenience food/retail outlet in western europe. healthy. reasonably priced. good selection of breads and filling. if you can find a store that has cream cheese (i know of only one and am keeping it secret), then try that with a selection of pickles, onion and honey mustard sauce on italian bread. mmm mmm.

      thats what i sound like to talk to at the moment. i have the most stuffy nose ever. constantly blocked. head feels like its stuffed with cotton wool. sore throat. dont know if my tablets are making it better or worse. when i stop them the symptoms seem to alter- runny nose, sneezing replace stuffy nose, cant breathe. and the tablets are making me really drowsy but unable to sleep any longer than normal. cant seem to win. wasnt this bad last year. and it stopped by the start of june. oh well.

      i read in the paper yesterday that a woman hit and run driver who killed a man got a fine of 90 odd quid and a 2 year ban. she had no tax, no insurance, no MOT and her tyres were in a dangerous state. she is also a convicted smack addict. the guy she killed was just 22.  she admitted running him over. she admitted leaving the scene without stopping to check how he was.  as there were no witnesses to say she was driving dangerously, all she was sentenced with was the tax, mot and insurance evasion. £90?!! for a mans life. road tax alone costs £160, insurance at least tripple that. And how can not having an MOT not be considered dangerous driving? having an unfit car on the road is just like strapping a bomb to yourself and jumping up and down.  and a 2 year ban. she should be in prison for at least that long.  sorry. im starting to sound like a daily mail reader. obviously i dont know the womans circumstances, i dont know the ins and outs of the case... but it just really gets to me that drivers think its their right to drive. its not. its a privelege. thats why you have a liscence. think what the word liscence means. it implies some form of responsibility. especially when your driving two tons of high performance metal around. people dont stop to think the damage they can do with a car. think of this young guys family. robbed.  and it happens all the time. people who kill other people using a car get charged with wreckless driving. very rarely manslaughter. they get short sentences, usually fines and a ban.  now lets imagine i had a gun (i dont). and its my hobby to shoot. ive had this gun and a liscence for it for 10 years. been very responsible. no accidents. in fact ive got certificates saying im a top class marksman. one afternoon i have a coupla drinks with lunch, then my mate rings up and says, wanna come duck shooting? i say alright then, whats the worst that could happen? then in a field a bit later, my gun accidentaly goes off and i blast my mates head off. goes to court. i get charged with manslaughter, in posession of a gun under the influence. ive got no police record. im a fine upstanding citizen. heck im an advanced marksman with certificates. it was an accident.....10 years minimum. never allowed to own a gun again.  slightly different but equally plausible situation.  lets say i own a car (i dont). and its my hobby to drive. ive had this car and a liscence for it for 10 years. been very responsible. no accidents. in fact ive got certificates saying im an advanced driver. one afternoon i have a coupla drinks with lunch, then my mate rings up and says, wanna come for a drive? i say alright then, whats the worst that could happen? then on a street a bit later, little johnny steps out in front of the car and gets splattered over the bonnet. goes to court. i get charged with dangerous driving and being slighlty over the legal limit. ive got no police record. im a fine upstanding citizen. heck im an advanced driver and jonny just stepped out between parked cars, it was an accident...2 years suspended sentence, 5 year ban plus court costs.  its just wrong.

      the greater part of my bank holiday monday was spent writing an essay. not fun. still have about a thousand words left to do. ive got today and friday off and its due in on monday. should finish it ok. i really should listen to the advice of the lecturers and start it earlier, doing little chunks at a time, but ive never really worked that way before. we've had months to do it.  also, as is traditional, we went to the pop quiz at the sunflower. i think we came 3rd. we came 2nd last week, winning 4 pints of beer, first prize is a gallon. its dead hard though.

      and they said id never  urlLink make  it.     due to the large amount of time i now find on my hands, i have managed to find some amusing/entertaining links. i am not bored.  i like quizez and stuff (cuz they boost my ego). heres a  urlLink geography   test i found on some american blokes blog, he suprisingly got a very low score. i got 88. it is quite hard- the balkan region being particularly challenging. im gonna take some of their other tests in a bit.  and why have we never heard of  urlLink this  concept before? its ingenious. a train and lorry all in one. road and rail transport integrated. i bet there are vested interests at work stopping the development of this idea, cuz i reckon its a blinder and should have been got off the ground ages ago.  i was watchin the local news on telly last nite and it had this report about a young photographer who had won prizes, and ive also been reading another persons blog who is quite keen on the old photies. im a bit poor at taking pictures. cant get them to look classy or professional. anyway. this  urlLink blokes  photos are quite good. think he does advertising and stuff.

      Day two of my summer holiday (or is it  day 3? cant remember) has seen me enjoying the same heady mix of cable TV with breakfast, bidding for some stuff on ebay and soaking up the marvelous english summer weather in my garden.  i might have spent a bit too long in the sun though, as my nose has started to peel. read loads of my book- Hakluyts voyages and discoveries- but my eyes hurt as the sun was bouncing off the white pages, cant find my sunnies.  oh yesh- i got my helmet. It came via UPS, in one of those big brown vans like you see on american films. How very continental.  It fits. it looks pretty good i reckon, although i am getting a touch of pizza delivery boy vibes off it, that should pass as i wont be getting a 50cc scooter, but a mini harley lookalike bike if all goes to plan. heres a pic of me in it.      and here is what wearing a helmet for too long can do to you. (note the massive amounts of shine on my face are due to the early evening sun blazing in through the window.)

      Happy Days! im on holiday. and loving it. today i am going to trim the hedge in the garden. at my own leisurely pace. it is shaping up to be a pretty hot day by British standards. so far we have had 2 weeks of summer weather, back in june. it has been raining or overcast ever since.  but the true summer starts here. cuz im free. get in.  this morning i have been mostly listening to the mighty Hefner. id forgotten how good this album was.     the past few days ive been beavering away on ebay and some motorbike sites looking at equiptment/accessories and bikes. Ive got my test next Wednesday, and hopefully a few weeks after that i'll be getting a bike if all the finances are in place. Ive already bought myself a helmet off ebay so i better get a bike, or i'll just look very eccentric walking round in a crash hat all day. this is the one i got.    its a kinda retro, cream and red, open face one. got a little peaked visor too. hoping its delivered soon. so far i havent been scammed on ebay. fingers crossed. im also bidding on some cool brown leather gloves and a flying jacket- you know the RAF, sheepskin and leather type. i wanna go for a retro cool look on the bike, so when i fall off it at the traffic lights, people wont laff as much.

         i was thinking about flowers the other day, and how i like bright yellow and orange ones, none of your morbid purple or deep reds for me. then i got to thinking about funerals, and how what if at my funeral , the folks arranging it gave me shitty flowers. that would be rubbish. i want flowers in the style of a celebration, no wreaths or plain somber stuff. exotics all the way. cheers to  urlLink pause4thought  for the above  urlLink tombstone  link.  also i want some quality music to be played. seahorses, stone roses, bluetones, a bit of delays. i dont want to be cremated. just in case. and i want to be buried somewhere cool like on a mountainside, not in a cemetary. so that in a thousand years when they find my bones i can be on telly on one of those "meet the ancestors" style archaelogy programmes.  also, i want to be taken to the chapel on a trailer pulled by bicycles, and i want everbody who comes to my funeral to travel there by bike, (motor or pedal), and be dressed in 60's/70's retro gear.  it should be a celebration, with baby photos and stuff shown on a slide projector, and a massive buffet after.

      ive been reading a few other blogs this week, and have found some good links which im gonna basically nick if i can find them again. this is a quality  urlLink T-shirt  sales site. i particularyly like the "i came on Eileen" shirt.  work this week has been alright. ive been acting all professional and that. i actually did a doctors round by myself yesterday. 2 docs, a consultant and me, walking around seeing patients. It was fookin cool. the docs were young and not all arsey. they were asking me loads of questions about the patients, and actually making medical decisions based on my opinions and evidence. Rock on. the consultant was even havin a laff with me about random stuff.

      This is my onehundreth post. its like a birthday for my blog. aw, im getting all emotional. id like to celebrate by posting a few pictures of friends and family. &nbsp;  &nbsp; This is my family a few years back when we took my nan to Scarborough. &nbsp; below is a pic of my sister Laura and her fiance (my future brother in law) Lee.    &nbsp;   dogs   this is my old dog jasper, he died when i was about 14   &nbsp; this is my current dog, jack. hes crazy as a cococnut. he was a rescue dog from the home. i reckon his previous owner mustve dropped him on the head. several times.&nbsp;hes getting on a bit now, slowing down, but still eccentric in his manner.    &nbsp; this is my sisters dog, amy. still a bit of a puppy and very timid, but extremely energetic. it never sleeps.    &nbsp;   friends    i dont have enough pictures of my mates. i dont think&nbsp;i have any photies of my mates from uni at all. i got loads from lancaster, but ive kinda lost touch with all those guys. also mates from previous jobs or those met through ex-girlfriends or when travelling etc are the kind of people you tend not to keep in contact with, but these i suppose are the hardcore of my friends from home;     andy, ste, chin and bec. and i suppose dunc deserves a mention. this is him.    apologies if you have been left out, but i probly dont have any pics of you.

      Im feeling a bit guilty today, cuz i should be at work, but i couldnt face it- went to quiz last nite, didnt get home till 12, so i would have had a max of 5 hours sleep. not enuff before a 12 hour shift. going to say i got my days mixed up. but i still feel guilty. &nbsp; reasons to be joyful: -I bought myself a webcam! many photos of interesting things in my house will follow im sure. -this is my 99th post. i better make the next one a good 'un. -its nearly holidays. -tour de france is still on. -olympics on soon. &nbsp; Ive decided to go on a diet.  Ive been looking at myself in the mirror lately and its not good. im no longer 'getting' a beer belly, ive got one. and my face is getting fatter- which is always a bad sign. admittedly ive been letting myself go a bit; eating the wrong things, drinkin pints when out, not much exercise. my legs have lost all tone, and i weigh 86.8kg. bad. i havent been out on my bike much at all this summer- yes im busy with work and uni and relaxing when not there, but last summer i was out every day without fail. i was lithe last year, now im flabby. its not good. so im going on a serious and strict diet. since i cant seem to find the time to&nbsp;burn calories off through exercise, im going to have to reduce my intake in order to slim down. i can tone up with the occasional run and weights session i reckon. This is the plan: I will cut out all sweets, crisps, chocolate and cheese. no white bread- only wholemeal. no pints of beer. no desert- only fruit as a pudding. no snacking between meals, except for fruit. no chips. no fast food. no high sugar, high fat foods. cut down all portion sizes. &nbsp; right. I will keep you updated. &nbsp;

      i was thinking, what if i ever went missing- fell down a hole, or lost my memory and ended up living as a tramp in Denmark- what picture would they use on my missing persons poster. or if i was wanted by the police&nbsp;or summat. i dont have many decent photies of myself. i was lookin today, and the only recent ones ive got are of me doing something stoopid or on holiday in ridiculous poses. Ive got some passport size photos i use for ID cards and stuff, but i tend to recycle them, ripping them out of one card to use in another, so they're a bit old. heres a few examples:    they arent really representative of me now though. i tend not to wear my glasses as much, and my hair isnt like that anymore. I'll have to get a webcam sometime.

      i had my second work related blood spurting incident last week. i reckoned i coped with it ok, which is just as well since i caused it. i took this guys venflon out (thats the needle that goes in your vein for drips). he was being discharged and wanted to go home as soon as poss. ive taken out plenty of venflons, its not hard, so i guess i was a bit blase about it all. anyway. i took it out, applied a bit of pressure, checked it wasnt bleeding, covered and taped it up. told him he could take it off in 20 mins and sent him on his merry way.  next thing i know he was coming back down the ward, arm covered in blood, dripping on the floor. Shit, thinks i. i cleaned it up, fixed his arm,&nbsp;he was ok. i shouldve applied more pressure, for longer. put the cover on tighter. asked him to keep his arm elivated for a while and not use it for a few minutes. &nbsp; my first work related blood spurting incident was in theatre, watching a transplant. This was in a more comedy spurting style as it pulsed out and up from the patient on the operating table, covering the surgeon.  &nbsp; My non-work related blood spurting incident was when i was aged 8 and fell down a canal bank into some broken glass, i had to have 14 stitches in my wrist. it looks like ive tried to top myself, cuz they didnt do the best sewing job and the scar is not the most aesthetically pleasing. i dont really remember much about the incident except my mom wrapping my arm up in dish cloths and rushing me to hospital in the car, with me puking on the back seat.

      i think i might start posting some more stuff about work on here now and again. just to add a bit of variety. &nbsp; Yesterday was ok, though our ward is becoming more and more "medical" every day. it is technically a surgical ward, with a speciality in renal transplants- but we seem to be getting all sorts of shit dumped on us.  Basically for those of you not in the know, a surgical patient does what it says on the tin- they come in for surgery, get better and go home. Your basic medical patient is long term unwell, usually over 70, needs a lot of help and doesnt seem to get any better. they seem to get stuck in the system. &nbsp; i suppose its all experiance, but i really dont want to work on a medical ward. now and again its ok, but its really 'heavy' work. lots of toileting, basic care and lifting etc. I prefer surgical because generally the patients are younger and have a focus to get better. you can make a difference as a nurse and help them progress. the other day i was helping a lady in her nineties drink and all she was saying, for the 45mins it took her to finish the cup of tea, was how she wanted it to end and how useless she was etc.  Dont get me wrong this is proper nursing, and i really felt for her and did my best, used all my communication skills etc and i did get something out of it. i just couldnt see me doing this day in, day out for the next few years. &nbsp; ideally when i qualify id like to do summat in a clinic with day patients. maybe an asthma or diabetes clinic. fractures, day surgery maybe. i dont really want to work on a ward but if i had to itd be a surgical ward with a specialisation so i can progress up the ladder quicker. or perhaps a cardiac ward- thats interesting. i wouldnt mind doing a roving hospital based job like being part of a critical outreach team or a tissue viability nurse- someone who sees patients all over the hospital and wonders about at leisure with a set caseload. im really interested in obesity and nutrition issues, so if theres that sort of role out there id go for that. im not interested in community nursing as yet but its gonna be interesting when i get my community placement, see what its like. theres loads of other nursing roles i havent experianced yet, so one of them might take my fancy before i qualify. theres also loads of jobs in the private sector for people with health related degrees, also charities and government health programmes- might move into these desky type jobs later in life. &nbsp; If i wasnt doing this- dream job wise, id be a dog handler or dog trainer. i also quite like the idea of horticulture or organic small scale eco-farming, growing niche crops like chilli or blueberries, breeding rare&nbsp;animals;&nbsp;processing it small scale&nbsp;and selling at farmers markets. Park ranger in scotland would be good, or forrester. Lighthouseman- but theyre all automatated now. Owning an old book shop with dusty ancient books. &nbsp; &nbsp; footnote: theres loads of new fonts and stuff been added to the posting framework. might have a muck about in upcoming posts. &nbsp;

      just in case anyone hasnt seen me with the new and improved sideburns, i would like to take this opportunity to tell you that they do not look anything like this:     they actually look altogether more civilised than the eccentric John McCririck of Channel Four racing, whose sideburns in my opinion look more like overgrown, crazy man, ear lobe hair. my burns look cool- like Wolverine.

      a few reasons to celebrate:  ~for all those of a french persuasion- it was Bastile day yesterday. ~its St Swithens day today- therefore according to tradition the next 40 days will see the same weather as today, and its not been too bad so far. ~i only have 5 more shifts till my summer holiday. ~the tour de france has hit the pyrenees.   my sideburns are coming on nicely again, although im still subject to a few comments from the simple minded folk of this world. they dont seem to realise people can dress and look different for a sense of irony/comedy or just to be alternative. mostly its your townie, label wearing, celeb loving knuckledraggers with this attitude but some people who appear normal still dont get it. and they say americans have no sense of irony. i think its all part of a wider dumbing down in our culture.  i was thinking the other day how lucky i was to be born at the right time and place. not just because theres no war and technology has made life easy, but also because when i was a kid in the eighties with the recession money was tight for my family so i learnt how to appreciate things, also stupid things like there being only 4 channels on TV so when i meet people from similar backgrounds to me and the same age we immediately have things in common. Coming of age in the affluent late 90's has given me opportunities and allowed me to enjoy my early adulthood. the kids today have had it dead easy from the start and so wont fully appreciate their siuation.  im starting to sound like an old man. i'll stop.

      i dont often blog about my work but today was a doozy of a day. another 12 hour shift but it was split up by a meeting with my practice facilitator- a kind of go between for the uni and hospital, who makes sure im getting on Ok. she reckons im doing really well. and then 2 hours of "crash training" which was exhausting mentally and physically. basically i didnt know it was gonna be crash training toaday, i thought it would be a student support session- just a chance to air grievences and have a moan. but then they like to surprise you with this sort of emergency training beacause you never know when a cardiac arrest will happen, so youve always gotta be ready. i wont go into all the details but the set up was basically that a patient had stopped breathing, no pulse and we were first on the scene and had to do resuss. this involves getting the crash trolley, setting up the heart monitor, intubating, bagging the patient, heart massage and administering adreneline.  It was an extremely realistic set up. its knackering cuz you have to remember so much, it isnt just bouncing on the chest and breathing for the patient, theres a lot more to it than the stuff you see on telly. hearing some of the stories is pretty tough mentally as well. ive only been at one crash- i actually helped by setting up the oxygen, and the lady was ok in the end. its pretty frightening. the amount of responsibility is hard to think about. hopefully i wont freeze if it happens to me for real- and the way our ward is getting (more high dependency patients each month), it probably wont be too far away.  anyway, when i got back to the ward i thought it would be a nice easy afternoon. no such luck. i got roped into sitting in on tracheostomy training. sort of stuff you really need to pay attention to, cuz if you get it wrong when sorting someones tracky out it can cause the kind of crash situation id been training for earlier in the mornin. so i didnt get a lunch break till 4. and after that it was just mental with bells going every five mins and relatives asking this and that. im knackered now. oh well.

      or so said my old I.T. teacher. another favourite phrase of his was "dont bang the keys, or i'll bang you!" quite what he meant by 'bang' i dont know. anyway. ive been procrastinating a fair old bit the last coupla days and so have been mugged of a sizeable wad of time, which couldve come in handy for my essay. basically ive got all day tommorow to do it from just about scratch.  today is a write off. went out last nite. was decent. some quality examples of the fairer sex out and about in the old city. as per norm for me- no action. its been too long. unwittingly we were apparently dancing next to the members of an all female band called  urlLink Planet of Women , who were pretty snazily dressed and excellent dancers. they shoved some flyers in our hands, which i thought was just a club promo or summat, but on closer inspection this morning is a postcard with a pic of the band and an invite to join the mailing list. there was this arts event on this weekend in bham, called ladyfest, they mustve had a gig for that.  so ive had a lazy day due to a slight hangover combined with weeks of sleep deprivation starting to catch up with me. also thanks go to my mate ste who sent me this  urlLink game  site link which i have grown quite addicted to, along with this quality  urlLink retro  gaming site that JP sent me a while back. this means that each time i turn the computer on to start some research or do a bit of typing, i have a 'quick' game of pacman or pool first.  im growing my sidies back. bigger.  13.7

         i saw somebody nearly getting knocked down by a bus today. the bus driver was not impressed. the pedestrian was oblivious. how bad is the traffic around my house at the mo? v.bad. the M6/aston expressway shutdown has led to the A45 near me, being named as a primary alternative route, even though its a diversion of about 15 miles. anyway, it adds about 10 minutes onto my already 'leisurely' commute. dagnammit.  i blame my good friend chin, as his job involves deciding where to put traffic jams (or summat like that).

      im all for freedom of choice in fashion. i like alternative style clothing. im an indie kid. student style clothes. free and easy. why should you have to dress up to go out, if you dont want to? there is however one area where i will not compromise. Trainers. White trainers are wrong. and no longer are they just being worn by kevs and townies with their tracky bottoms tucked into their socks. they are starting to cross over into mainstream and even indie circles. its not right. the following are pictures of acceptable leisure style footwear.   the classic addidas samba suede. also available in leather for all you old skool fans. a good flat design, low profile almost deck shoe in nature.    puma speed cat low, my current trainer. it manages to encompass both modern and retro styling. good wholesome suede.     a generic brown, flat, striped trainer.

      im not usually one to blow my own trumpet, but today i think i shall pucker my lips. last night we triumphed. Our quiz team, "Brian Blesseds Mountaineering Club" won the general knowledge quiz at the Sunflower Lounge. its usually a pop quiz, and we come about 3rd out of 8 most weeks. this week we came 1st out of 12 teams. and we had the smallest team- just 3 of us. Our prize- a gallon of beer (thats eight pints). get in. it was an awesome display, with the deepest recesses of our minds being probed by the quizmistress. We excelled in the history, geography and soap rounds.

          "This is a story about an ordinary teddy-bear. When he was made, they found something wrong with him, and threw him away like a piece of rubbish into an old dark storeroom. Then from outer-space, a spotty man bought him back to life with his cosmic dust. He took him to a magic cloud where Mother Nature gave him special powers. That bear became Super Ted!"   some of my mates tend to go on about cartoons and kids programmes from the 80's, and i can never remember them. but one that does stick in my mind is superted. i used to watch it avidly, and even had a duvet cover with him on.  Super Ted lives in a space station, or a tree-house. He shares his humble abode(s) with his friend Spotty, who was the guy who rescued him in the first place. By day he’s your average walking talking teddy bear, but by muttering some secret words, he becomes Super Ted!   His main foe is Texas Pete with his sidekicks Bulk and Skeleton. They’re always up to something or other that causes a problem for someone or other.

          Catweazle was an eccentric Saxon hermit and would be magician whose spells seldom worked. Living in eleventh century England he often got himself into trouble with Norman soldiers, so one day when a group of them tried to capture him, he desperately attempted a spell to escape. For once it worked, though not in the way it was intended. Instead of moving him in space it shifted him through time to the twentieth century. He ended up in Hexwood Farm, in a world where everything he saw - motor cars, telephones, electric light ('Electrickery') - appeared to him to work by magic.

      over the past coupla months ive been slowly increasing the amounts of cayenne pepper and chilli in my cooking in order to increase my tolerance to spicey foods. i think its working.  on a not all too unrelated vein, i was munching on a bag of Walkers taste sensations thai sweet chilli flavour crisps on the way home from work last night. very nice, but not as classy as they try to make out. certainly no kettle chips. ....anyway, my point; i was looking at the ingredients on the back and noticed the phrase "contains a source of phenylalanine". Bloody hell thinks i. whats that then? its gotta be bad if theyre forced to mention it. well ive googled a bit and apparently Phenylalanine is a neutral, genetically coded amino acid. It is essential in human nutrition.  and like most things can be good and bad. i shall now cut and paste a few bits of description from various websites:   GOOD:  It is used in elevating the mood since it is so closely involved with the nervous system, as well as help with memory and learning and has been used as an appetite suppressant.  It is used to treat depression and the D form may also be helpful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and chronic pain in both osteo-arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis with mixed results. Increases blood levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine - all three required for neurotransmission. Dietary deficiency is rare but symptoms may include lethargy, edema, weakness, skin lesions as well as liver damage and slow growth. A deficiency in diet would only occur with an extremely low protein intake.    BAD:  Most consumers don't know that too much Phenylalanine is a neurotoxin and excites the neurons in the brain to the point of cellular death.  ADD/ADHD, emotional and behavioral disorders can all be triggered by too much Phenylalanine in the daily diet. If you are one in ten thousand people who are PKU or carry the PKU gene, Phenylalanine can cause irreversible brain damage and death, especially when used in high quantities or during pregnancy. Phenylalanine is 50% aspartame, and to the degree humans consume diet products, Phenylalanine levels are reaching a dangerous peak. It is important to learn about the ingredients within your foods, especially isolated amino acids like Phenylalanine. They are in combination within nature for a reason - they don't belong in isolated form for the healthy human diet. Nature provides amino acids in combination; only man isolates them for processing purposes. The 1976 Groliers encyclopedia states cancer cannot live without phenylalanine.   Bloody hell! eh?

         this is my favourite apple juice. its so nice. and made from 100% reel english pressed apples- not from concentrate, with only vitamin C or ascorbic acid added in order to slow discolouration. The vast majority of "fresh juices" that you will buy will actually be made from concentrate and water, not squeezed fruit. So they get the fruit, freeze dry it and crush it into powder so it keeps for longer, and then add water when they are ready to distribute it. This is bad enough but if you buy a product described as apple or orange "juice drink" then it means it probably has little or no fruit (or even concentrate) at all, and is made with flavourings and sweeteners. Tropicana pure premium is my orange juice of choice. look out for the "not from concentrate" message on the label.  ive been thinking about food a lot recently. as may be seen from the past couple of blogs.

      i dont like it when people correct other peoples english. we should rejoice in non-standard english. more than 90% of english users speak a "non-standard" form. English is an evolving language. just think of the way BBC broadcasters spoke as recently as the 1950's as compared to now. you cannot stop the changes from happening, therefore it is pedantry to try to do so by nitpicking on a persons language usage.  i hate tennis, especially wimbledon, since its on all the time and means neighbours is cancelled for over 2 weeks. but this more than makes up for it.   that shaparova from russia is quality. if i ever get too old and desperate im gonna buy me a russian bride.    13.10

      the final countdown! The Prologue to the 2004 Tour de France starts on Saturday. Cant wait. I havent really been keeping up with the Grand Tours this season. I couldnt tell you who won the Vuelta or the Giro, but that doesnt matter cuz its the Tour that counts. so whos gonna win? well ive narrowed it down.   Lance Armstrong. The big man. Five times winner going for his sixth. nobody has done it before. hes getting on a bit at 32. revelations about taking drugs have just come out in America. he had a messy divorce last year. but he lives for le tour. he has the most experiance, is in the best team and everybody fears him.    Jan Ullrich. 30. won it aged 23, since then perennial second placer. But just off the back of a convincing win of the Tour of Switzerland. hes strong and knows the tour and its contenders well. a good team behind him, but is it enough?    Iban Mayo. My fave rider at the mo. From the Basque country. i have a T-shirt featuring the fella. hes a quality climber and will get good support in the mountain stages. but theres a lot of flat stages in this race, can he keep the pace during time trials?    Tyler Hamilton. American. Fourth last year. A good all rounder, but doesnt excell in any one aspect of the game. he is consistent though. And get this- he rode the majority of last years race with a broken collarbone!    Roberto Heras. defected from Lances team last year, now riding for the dubious spanish Liberty Seguros outfit. Always the understudy and donkey worker for Armstrong, but is it too late for the 30 year old to break free and show his own potential?    Ivan Basso. 26. Italian. At the prime of his career. Climber. Power rider. Tactician. Admired by the big man himself as a threat. 7th last year. A quality team in CSC behind him. some say hes been riding too much this season. does he have the mental strength to challenge for the yellow jersey?

      i got my leather bikers jacket in the post this morning. it looks v.cool. i dont think this photo does it justice. it makes my shoulders look dead big.     i just found out where my next nursing placement will be. and its not good. its in Rugby, which for those of you who dont know is about 35 miles away from my house. the placement itself looks okay, its on a critical care unit, so lots of high dependency cardiac and respiratory patients. bit intense, but at least im not on A+E just yet like 2 of my mates. its not till the end of november, so i just hope ive got my motorbike by then. only prob is that it will be seriously poor weather at that time of year.  im off to scarborough tommorow, till thursday, so probably wont be able to update the old blog. but i will be back.

      i went out for a little pootle around on the back of my uncles 125cc scooter style bike this morning. it was pretty ace. we got up to 60mph easy, and thats with 2 hefty grown men on the back. he's trying to convince me to get an automatic, twist and go style bike, he reckons i'll find it much easier and less hassle than a bike with gears. i have to agree with him. and you get just as good performance out of them.  i even had a go on it by myself in a car park, and i have to say it was really easy, nice and smooth, and fun. however, despite all the arguments in favour of me getting this type of bike, i just dont like how they look. it may seem silly, but for me, in this instance it really is a case of style over substance. you cant get away from the fact that a cruiser style 125, with chopper style seating and plenty of chrome looks damn cool and like a bigger bike, while a 125 scooter looks just the same as a 50cc scooter that a 16 year old kid would ride on.

      sweet baby jesus and the orphans! i failed my CBT today. as they say in sporting circles "Gutted!"  well i didnt really fail as such, since it isnt really a test, but rather 'training'. lets just say that i didnt obtain my certificate today. in any case i have to go back to the training centre when next there is an available slot and do the days course again, because im "not safe" to go on the roads.  the course was alright; only 3 of us and one instructor who was a sound fella. the one trainee was an advanced car driving instructor, and the other lad was only doing the course because he had let his previous CBT run out, so hed been on the road for 2 years already. therefore i was the only complete novice, and it all went a bit quickly for me. i didnt even have a clue what a clutch was for at the start of today.  my main problem was that i kept stalling. i was ok once i got going, it was just starting off and stopping i had probs with. anyway the instructor said that he could tell i didnt have the confidence to go on the open road just yet. im quite happy with that. id prefer a bit more practice. he said some schools would have just let me through, but they wanted to make certain we were safe.  i get to take as many goes as i like, since i paid for a guaranteed pass.   never mind. i'll try harder next time.

         thats a picture of one of my new motorcycling gloves. it smells really good. all leathery, but not like an old man who has spent his life working in the sun, no, more like the lovely leathery smell from a shop selling wallets and bags at an airport. note the picture of a bull/buffalo on the wrist of the glove. nice.  below is a picture of my number one bonsai tree. ive forgotten what make of tree it is, but i bought it at the garden centre and it was a big bushy old thing. but with Mr Miagi style patience and Roy Castle style dedication (for dedication is what you need if you want to be a record breaker), i have clipped and pruned it down to its present state.    note the leaning appearance of the above example, this is known as Shakan or slanting style. My number two bonsai, below, is an informal upright style tree or Moyogi if you will.

      did you know about Ewen Mcgregor and a pal of his going round the world together on their motorbikes? i heard about it when they set off and apparently they finished yesterday. i thought it was gonna be massive but its been pretty low key in the press. ewen is pretty cool, ive decided, since seing him do a prog in the jungle with Ray Mears about survival and stuff. theyve got a website about the journey called  urlLink long way round  Pretty good.   urlLink Ray Mears  is pretty cool too. hes the bloke who does all the woodlore/bushcraft/how to survive if your lost in the jungle sort of stuff.  in a similar vein, remember this chap?   thats right. its Orinoco, one of the wombles of wimbledon common. if i remember correctly Orinoco loved sleep and food. and picking up litter, like wot all wombles do.
