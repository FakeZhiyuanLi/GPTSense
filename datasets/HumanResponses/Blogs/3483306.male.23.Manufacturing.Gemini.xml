        And I pay my respects to my late uncle Richard. Always the first one to punch me in the stomach. :) My grandma and grandpa of my dad's side. Miss ya all. On a side note, today might actually have some good in it. Got invited to a cookout by the Attracted One. Should be fun..

        ...relationships happen. Nobody can. It's common sense. And here I have Peaches telling me to make things happen. Sure, I can make Devry happen. I can make Lawrence happen. I can make Network Administration happen. But I can never make a relationship happen. One, it's free will. Free will can't be controlled. Two, it take mutual emotions for it to happen. As far as I'm concerned, there isn't one person I know now that I'll spend my life with. It just doesn't happen. I obviously haven't met her, and quite frankly I'm getting very impatient. But what the hell, don't tell me to make something that I cannot control happen!

        So I found out the start dates at Devry. Turns out there are 6 different start dates in a year. The next one is July 12th. Then it starts again in October. I'd love to start in July, but there are some conflicts. First is my internship I have here. I get out of class in June, which would only give me a month for my internship. And internship requirement is to do 200+ hours. Plus I'm not real sure if I can get all the paperwork done and turned in and all set up by that date. Plus I gotta have a job by then and a place to stay. What I think I would really love to do is go in October, although it's 5 long months away, but save money and get up there a few months early, kind of get aquainted a little with the new surroundings. That would mean that after I'm done with my internship, I'd have to get a second job. A day job. Taking all this into consideration, it looks like I have a hell of alot to do. Alot of planning and thinking and organizing. I just want to have this thought out so I won't be calling for help or something like that. It has to be carefully thought out and planned. But I do have one concern...how hard is it to get a job up there after summer? Let's hope the 3rd time is a charm...

        Is wanting something now and not later pure excitement or impatience? Because I don't want to wait to get into devry. I guess part of it is because I want to get the hell out of this town. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice town. There just isn't anything here. I just found out that the next semester starts on July 12th. Even less time to get this done. Looks like I'm still on the late and fast track. I think I'll eventually end up going to the one after this next semester, since they have 6 different start dates. I believe this is something that you have to do alot of planning and preparation for. I even started a new savings account, just for this one thing. How unusual of me. I must be pretty damn serious about this. Peaches is supposed to help me today, so hopefully she'll come soon...

        They say patience is a virtue. It may be a virtue, but it's something I lack. I don't like spending to much time on anything. Why do you think I couldn't make it through Pitt State 5 years ago. Yet, here I am, thinking of going to Devry for 4 long ass years. It would be a miracle if I pulled it off. My life doesn't even have patience. People come and go quickly. But that's my life. The fast lane. Now if I could just slow it down, if I could just get people to stay around longer. If I could just...

        ..I can feel it deep inside of  me. I can feel  the war that I am fighting with myself. And for the first time in my life, I am  truly winning. I am dominating my own mind. It's kind of weird how the path I took to get here. All I had to do was see my mistakes. All I had to do was lose someone important to me. And now my thoughts are forever changed, my way of thinking. I will no longer be negative.  I will always be positive. I will not worry that no one likes me. I will not worry that I will fail. I will not worry that I'll be alone. I will not worry wheather no one cares or not. I will not worry if I'm accepted or not. I will not worry about anything. But most importantly, I will not let life get me down anymore. Happiness will flow through me one way or another, wheather I'm alone or with someone. I  just want to say thanks Ash & Peaches. Thanks for making me see and teaching me. I wouldn't have seen this is it wasn't for you two. Peaches, I'm glad I met you. And I'll miss you as you start life in Lawrence. Who knows, maybe I'll run into you up there. But for  now, let's just enjoy our convos.... And I can feel people looking at me as I act differently. With   more energy, with more excitement. Life can only get better!

        ..Who is Blache23. I'm the analizer, the observer of the room. The one that sits quietly and watches your every move, listens to every word you say, and  analizes  both sides of it. I'm the one you see passing by. The one that lives his life with YIELD. I'm the hometown boy. Going for the home teams. I'm  the thinker. The person that takes everything in and tries to  think to much, before I do anything. I'm  the italian food lover. I'm the person that takes everything you say or do and never forgets, well rarely. I'm also the one that makes mistakes and pays for them dearly, not the one that makes mistakes and gets away with them. I grew up  outside the world. So I'm quite a ways behind in certain aspects of others in world. I see things differently, so much that it makes no sense to most. In the end, I'm the person that is inexperienced in many things and have alot to learn. Hell, I'm the one that wonders if anyone reads this...

        ..In cases like mine. I don't know how I'm going to do it since this goes all the way back to my childhood. The way I was brought up, the kind of father I was around. Just like at work, I was watching people flirting and playing around. And I thought to myself, is this the real world? I mean I was brought up to be serious and not to play around. That was the real world. I was brought up with hate, not love. Hate towards my father and my peers. And hate triggers anger. And too much anger and I blow steam. It's gotta change. I guess the first step is anger management or counseling. One way or another, it's gotta change..

        Like getting arrested  for resisting arrest and speeding in from of you're classmates. Just makes me realize that the person   you're sitting next to isn't all  he/she claims to be. Everyone does stupid things, be we learn from them. Well, the ones of us  that actually pay attention to what goes on, that is...  Noticed I haven't been writing much lately. Yeah, my life has gotten a little busy. I  may be moving out in 3 weeks...away from my parents that is. In with a  really good friend. Good thing I have friends. Couldn't survive without them.   And   yeah, I'm am an ex-smoker! What can I say, it's about damn time. It's like I always felt, theres a time to quit everything. Things will come...when it's time for them to come...

        ...Towards the end of the semester. I dream of that day. But with one book left to go through in 3 weeks, everyone has decided that we should go through the first one again as well. Imagine that, going through two books at the same time. How much crazier is this going to get? I wonder...  ...Good news! I called and confirmed my tour date with Devry on Friday. I've been so tired lately. Work is wearing me out. And it's not paying me enough. I think the problem is all the money I spend on gas. After I get out from class, I'll be able to save some money. I hope these 3 weeks go by fast...But then, that's the life I live. Look ahead, fasten my seatbelt, don't look back, and don't slow down!

        ...That I got my pin number for my FAFSA. I think it totally freaked Khat out. I even freaked myself out a little. I mean I haven't been that excited or even showed it since I was in love. Now I gotta go get a copy of my parents tax returns. I'm 23 and I still gotta have their tax info. How lame is that?!?! It's like you're not an adult untill you're 25. Car insurance doesn't go  down untill you're 25 either. Grr... But yeah, the good news is that I have a meeting with Devry on Friday, June 11th. Supposed to be an hour and a half or some long ass time like that. Gotta call and confirm it. Plus I'll be staying up there for the weekend. Going to a concert Khat invited me to. 'The Darkness'...sounds hardcore to me...Should be fun!

        ..Of doing Lynn? I'm a better man than one that has to go to the past to get things. If I want sex, I'll get it where I am. Not some two hours away, back in the past. Just the fact that I thought about it makes me vulnerable! Grrr!!!!! Lynn, if you read this, yes, I still have feelings for you. I still care about you, love you, but I cannot do this! I firmly believe our time is over. Yes, I can and would love to be friends, but that's all that I can offer you anymore. I will not get back into the ways that we once knew each other. You come to me only because you're lonely. I am a better reason than that! So, if I was to see you, nothing, and I mean nothing will happen. We can be friends without benefits. We still connect...on some levels. That's what starts good friendships. Let's just see if at least this can last...  Another thought...My priorities are now set. No one will change them and I will live my life according to them. They are in this order: 1 - Graduate from Devry. 2 - Make a good income. 3 - Friends. 4 - Love. Now notice, I put love last. Those that know me know I am obsessed and impatient with love. I'm sure that along the priorities of the first 3, love will come my way. I'm just done being negative and worrying about it. It's all a matter of time...;)

        ...isn't easy. It's very hard. But sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. One thing I will not be is vulnerable, no matter what anyone means to me. If I gotta be alone in everything I do, then by god, I'm ready!  In more pleasant talk, I've taken the first step in getting to where I want to go. Opened a new savings account today. Hopefully, I'll have enough to spare by October. Go me!

        ...I go for the wrong ones. They say they care, they say all the right words. Why can't they mean it.&nbsp; Why do they have to lie? What did I do to deserve these people? To deserve this hurt? To deserve this anger? To deserve this hate? I just don't get it...Hopefully there is a woman out there that is loyal and truthful...but I wonder...is there such a thing?

        ...Again. Is it the same square one that I was at a few months ago? Yes, I believe so. How so? First, everyone I know has a distance from me. They are 'net' friends. That means I'll be spending all my time sitting on my ass in front of this damn computer...just to talk...or not.. I know if someone doesn't come along soon, I just may be back to my old self...or not...I'm still trying to figure out what to do...Oh, what to do?!? Lonliness is a bitch!

        ...obsessed with getting out of here. As a matter of fact, I just applied for a new job. This job calls for 12 hour shifts. That's 72 hours a week. And the whole point in doing this is to pay off my car in a mere 4 months instead of 14. That'd come in handy when I get bill I have to pay later. Today, I went to Computer Plus and see if I can get my internship there. The boss was on call when I arrived, so I should get a call sometime soon. Speaking of getting calls, don't you hate it when someone calls you and you don't know the number or who it is. I totally HATE that! Especially since I haven't give out my new number to many people. Grrr... In short, I have a busy life..thats about to get even busier...Hope I don't fall over dead before it's over!
