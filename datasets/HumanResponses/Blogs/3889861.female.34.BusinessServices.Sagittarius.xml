      I just read this entry on another diary site by Tatiana...  ::begin entry::  got a chance to help someone today.  And I did it without thinking. John and I were driving home from Winnipeg today, it's about two hours from where we live and is my home city. Anyway we were driving down the highway, I was dosing a little but I was still totally with it and suddenly I hear John say, "Oh Shit!" and it takes a lot to get a reaction like that out of him. So suddenly I was awake. The truck in front of us lost it's back rear wheel swirved and rolled a few times and then landed in the ditch. We pulled over John got out of the car to help I just grabbed my cell phone called 911. I didn't think I just did. A van stopped behind us and a lady and a gentleman got out. The gentleman ran towards the truck with John and the woman helped me tell the 911 operator where exactly on the highway we were. Another man pulled over and started directing traffic. Another guy going the other way pulled over and ran across the ditch dividing the road to help, he started clearing depree and tended to the girls. Two got out by themselves and John and the other gentleman helped the driver out she was stuck. Later the guy who had been directing traffic came over and said he saw me call and thanked me for doing that. After we gave our statements (because we were directly behind them) and were free to go, as we were pulling away John asked me, "Did I tell you to do that?" and I said, "Um no I just did it." and John just said, "good for you."   The people on the scene before the police and ambulence were amazing. It was a little scary at the beginning because all I could see is the uncarrage of the truck because it was on it's side, stuff all over the highway, John and another gentleman running over there and all I could hear is a girl screaming while I'm waiting for someone to pick up (it took 2 rings). As I paced while on the phone with with 911 operator who was patching me through and wanted me to stay on the line I watched John and what he was doing. I was overcome with a sense of pride. He didn't seem to think he just acted. I thought to myself wow my boyfriend is brave. So brave. When I went over to tell them that there was help on the way John wanted me out of the way and away from the truck so I wouldn't get hurt because there was glass and fluid of some kind leaking from the truck.   Just before John left after dropping me off at home John was hugging me and said, You can put this down on your list of things I've done, you helped someone.  We did what we could of course we don't think it was enough but it boils down to we did what we could and that is more than enough. However, I certainly hope I don't have to use my cell phone for emergency purposes again any time soon.  ::end entry::

      God created the heavens and the earth to manifest the truth; let him be exalted above all gods. He created human beings from a single seed; yet human beings openly dispute with him.

      My soul cries out, snared by the beauty of the formless one. As I cry by myself, night and day, beauty amassed before my eyes surpasses numberless moons and suns. If I look at the clouds in the sky, I see his beauty afloat; and I see him walk on the stars blazing my heart.

      The Self cannot be pierced by weapons or burned by fire; water cannot wet it, nor can the wind dry it. The Self cannot be pierced or burned, made wet or dry. It is everlasting and infinite, standing on the motionless foundations of eternity. The Self is unmanifested, beyond all thought, beyond all change. Knowing this, you should not grieve.

       For God commanded, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him surely die.' But you say, 'If any one tells his father or his mother, What you would have gained from me is given to God, he need not honor his father.' So, for the sake of your tradition, you have made void the word of God. You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said: 'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me;in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.'

       While they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place. And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sum of money to the soldiers and said, "Tell people, 'His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.' And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble." So they took the money and did as they were directed; and this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.   Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. And when they saw him they worshiped him; but some doubted.   And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age."

       In this time when we constantly interact with people of other cultures and nationalities, the Christian and Interfaith Relations Committee (CIRC) of FGC invites Friends to consider the challenges and opportunities inherent in a world in which the many religions confront each other daily. Religious differences play a role in many contemporary wars. Religion is too often used as a weapon to frighten or a tool to incite violence and hatred. Friends must demonstrate a different way.  Friends recognize the living Spirit of God as a Reality that transcends all names and forms. Our avoidance of creeds and simple manner of worship testify to this. Our form of worship is open and unstructured because we recognize that the Spirit cannot be contained! We cannot therefore dismiss the possibility that the Reality we worship is present under a name and form that is unfamiliar to us and present in other religions.   The end of words (even of Christ's own directions in the days of His flesh) is to turn men to the holy life and power from whence the words came.   —Isaac Penington  Friends readily acknowledge the presence of the divine Light within all, the living spirit of God present within all persons, in all times and places.   There is a principle which is pure, placed in the human mind, which in different places and ages hath had different names. It is, however, pure and proceeds from God. It is deep and inward, confined to no forms of religion nor excluded from any, where the heart stands in perfect sincerity. In whomsoever this takes root and grows, of what nation soever they become brethren in the best sense of the expression.    --- John Woolman  Since the Light is within all, we must suppose that it is reflected in others' religions. This gives us a basis for deep spiritual sharing with persons of other religions.   Love was the first motion, and thence a concern arose to spend some time with the Indians, that I might feel and understand their life and the spirit they live in, if haply I might receive some instruction from them, or they be in any degree helped forward by my following the leadings of truth among them.   --- John Woolman  This is not to say that all religions are one. The religions are indeed different. While Friends avoid creeds, our Testimonies---Truth, Nonviolence, Equality, Simplicity---are clear and not to be compromised, as is our practice of submitting to the guidance of the Spirit. These give us the guidance we need in our relating to other religions.  Yet we know the presence of the Spirit by its fruits. Where we see unconditional love, saintly lives, care for the needy, courageous defense of Truth, selflessness, submission to the guidance of the Spirit, etc., we may be sure that the Spirit is at work. There is no religion without some evidence of these.   The humble, meek, merciful, just, pious and devout souls are everywhere of one religion; and when death has taken off the mask they will know one another though the divers liveries they wear here makes them strangers.   — William Penn  The Religious Society of Friends has at its roots an illumination that is simultaneously Christian and Universalist. Our affirmation of the Light within is an affirmation of a universal divine reality. Our language, imagery and inspiration, however, is Christian. How are our Universalism and our Christianity two sides of the same coin?   Friends have always identified the Inner Light with the living Christ. Christ, in Quaker theology, is the Light. . . . In the final analysis, the Quaker doctrine of the Inner Light is really a radically Universalist interpretation of the Christian doctrine of the Holy Spirit.   —Samuel D. Caldwell   I owe all to God in Jesus Christ and say so to all sorts of people, but if someone says he finds the same in Ram or Buddha, what right have I to say he does not? . . . "Where love is, God is;" where the fruits of the spirit are displayed, there the spirit must be---the Eternal Christ, the loving caringness of God expressed in time and in human form, but not to be equated only with the Carpenter of Nazareth.   —Mary Barr, Quaker from about 1934, co-worker with Gandhi from 1932  We are called as Friends to lead lives that "take away the occasion of all wars." In today's shrinking and pluralistic world this surely includes reaching out in friendship to members of other religions. For the many whose faith is an important part of their lives, this requires us to take a sincere interest in their religion.  CIRC recommends:  a. Friendly discussions with members of other religions, held in a spirit of mutual respect and open mindedness.   b. Mutual visitation in which Friends meetings may well want to take the initiative in inviting other faith groups to visit one's own Friends meeting or asking permission to visit others' religious services.   c. Outreach to other religions in one's local community for joint engagement in service projects.   d. Joint youth events, especially if relations are estranged in local schools.   e. Vigilance in ensuring that local community events are welcoming to and inclusive of all religious, ethnic and cultural groups in the community.   One of the greatest fruits of such sharing is often one's own spiritual growth. Douglas Steere urges Friends to engage in a practice of:   mutual irradiation in which each is willing to expose [him or herself] with great openness to the inward message of the other, as well as to share its own experience, and to trust that whatever is the truth in each experience will irradiate and deepen the experience of the other.   We don't own the Spirit. The Spirit owns us, and all others. It is vast and great beyond our imagining. Though, as Friends, we acknowledge this, still we are accustomed to conceiving the Spirit, and too often even experiencing it, from our own inevitably limited perspective. Our experience, however cherished, cannot be but a glimpse of something infinite and infinitely beautiful. Deep listening and experiential sharing with members of other religions holds the possibility of deepening our experience of the Spirit by awakening us to aspects of that same Spirit that so far remain outside our awareness. This is a treasure we should not neglect.  At the same time, Friends are right to feel that we likewise have gems of great value in our own tradition and experience to share with others. We join with, and extend, George Fox's invitation to Friends to "walk cheerfully over the world, [listening to] and answering that of God in every one."

       I had a curious, curious dream last night.   I found myself visiting a beautiful church that I’d never been to before. It was everything I would imagine a church to be, done in the classical Greek style, with gorgeous white columns and rich red carpeting, and there were a lot of people there – men, women, children, all ages, all races, everything. There seemed to be some kind of celebration going on, and everyone was looking forward to some kind of festive occasion. Everyone there was very friendly and nice to me, and I felt so at home there – in that building, with those people. I felt like I’d found a new church home.   All of this occurred in the evening in this dream; it was an early summer evening, just coming on towards twilight, and the whole energy of the dream was peaceful yet lightly festive and friendly and welcoming.   I could go into all kinds of detail about what it looked like, but the most important thing to me was that feeling of peace, welcome, happiness, and “coming home.”   I knew I was in a different church from Woodside United Methodist, my first church home, but I realized that in this new church, I had found a place just as warm, just as welcoming, a fitting sequel as it were to that part of my spiritual life.   And I think the church was, by denomination, a Unitarian Christian church.   I’m wondering about that.  Many months ago, I had a dream wherein a voice said, “In Buddhism is salvation.” But now I’m seeing visuals of a church and I’m feeling strong feelings of welcome and peace and happiness there.   What does this tell me? I’ve never been good with dream interpretation. Even my own.   Shall I move on from the Pagan faiths? Is it just time in my life to do that?   As a living, growing being, is it that time in my life to shift and change?  Rain is lashing outside at the moment. I am watching and remembering…remembering a moment in my childhood. Standing in the den of the house where I grew up in Silver Spring, I gazed out the window into the backyard, and into the boughs of a pine tree that grew right up against that window. I could see, through the boughs, snow covering the ground. And I could also see, sitting in the boughs of that protective tree, a single cardinal, just sitting there in all his scarlet glory.   I couldn’t have been more than five or six years old, but there was such a powerful Zen quality to that moment, a timelessness, that has stuck with me all my life to the point where I can call up the deep feelings that attended that memory even now, in my mid-30s.   Somehow in that moment, with snow and bird and tree and child, there was a deep connection there of life, even in the midst of winter. I suppose what I’m getting at is that the peace and serenity I found there, is what I’m looking for in my spiritual search now.   I’m thinking that once I find that, I’ll know I’ve found my spiritual home. Last night’s dream conjured up similar sentiments. And what else would I think, but that’s what I want in my spiritual life?

        By Mary K. Blackmar   At the very center of the Quaker faith lies the doctrine of the Inner Light.   Briefly stated, the principle of the Inner Light is this: In every human soul there is implanted a certain element of God’s own spirit and divine energy. This element, known to the early Friends as “that of God in everyone,” or the “seed,” or the “seed of Christ,” or the “seed of Light,” means to them in the words of John “the Light that enlighteneth every man who comes into the world.”  The Quakers believe that no first hand knowledge of God is possible except through that which is experienced, or inwardly revealed to the individual human being through the working of God’s quickening spirit. So George Fox, in his Journal, is repeatedly shown commending troubled questioners to the “teacher within.” In his long, anxious search for eternal life and peace, he found no help until he learned to listen to the inner voice.  So basic is the article of belief that it governs and explains the attitude of the Friends toward many things. they include the person and ministry of Christ, the scriptures, the establishment and authority of the church and its usages of ceremony, symbolism and sacraments, and especially the intimate obligations of the individual life.  Broadly speaking, the office of the inner Light is twofold. First, it discerns between good and evil, revealing the presence of both in human beings and, through its guidance, offers the alternative of choice. Second, it opens to human consciousness the unity of all human beings.  The Quakers believe that the potentialities of evil as well as good are latent in every one. But Quakers do not share the Calvinistic conception of a chasm separating God and humans.  They feel, with Barclay, that the idea of inherited or “imputed” sin is an “invented and unscriptural barbarism.” They believe that the seed of God is as universal and potent in us as the seed of evil, and, if not resisted but nourished and cultivated, will become the controlling force in our lives. As George Fox saw an ocean of light overcoming an ocean of darkness, so the modern Quaker sees the power of God available to overcome the evil in the nature of anyone who truly wants to do the will of God. To a great extent, therefore, we are the arbiter of our own destiny, having the power of choice. Salvation, in the Quaker sense, lies in our power to become the children of God.  Closely related to this conception of salvation is the Quaker ideal of perfection, affirming that by “minding the Light,” waiting for ever fuller revelation of divine direction, the illuminated soul may eventually find it natural to live above the power or ordinary temptation. Such a life is never static, but always in a growing frame of wisdom, “shining more and more unto the perfect day.”  The Quaker sense of God’s immediate presence is the groundwork for a consciousness of human unity. Believing that all people partake in some measure of divine indwelling, the Friends are able to believe that where goodness is, there is God.  So it is possible for Friends to sympathize with the sincerity of all religious seekers. In this spirit they discover with Peter, after his vision, “Of truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons; but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.”  The attitude of the Friends toward the scriptures is a natural outgrowth of their belief in the Inner Light, Since the written word arose out of the inspiration of the spirit of God in humans, it is the spirit and not the word which is the final authority of truth.  While some religious groups have emphasized the Bible as the final and finished charter of spiritual governance, the Quakers believe in a “continuing revelation.” As the Light has shone, in the past, it has stirred the prophets, the saints and the apostles to record their deepest experiences of life and truth. So in the future, as the Light continues to shine, it should lead to further and fuller insights, to the understanding of divine new purposes, and to new powers of fulfillment.  Though the Inner Light, or the divine spirit, has always been available, the Quakers believe that in Jesus Christ the fullness of God’s divine revelation is made manifest—“made flesh and dwells among us, full of grace and truth.”  Since a sincere Friend aspires at all times and in all places to be conscious of the presence of God within, ceremonies and sacraments have but minor value.  Baptism means an inward or spiritual experience, not a ritual act. Communion is also of the spirit, and entails no outward act, being but a conscious openness to all divine intimations. The sabbath may differ in observance from other days but is not more holy.  Because Friends believe so ardently in the possibility of “immediate” or direct communion, they have felt no need of elaborate ecclesiastical establishments, organizations or authority. They were and are individualists, as well as group seekers, and in their individual lives they assume the obligation of searching out and following the will of God as it applies to them.  Through their acceptance of direct accountability, they have endeavored to make of religion a way of life. Through their individual concerns they have resisted oppression and started great movements for the righting of human wrongs.   About the Author:   Born in 1873, Mary K. Blackmar was graduated from the University of Iowa in 1910 and went on to obtain a Master’s degree from Columbia University in 1928 at the age of 55. Her literary experiences include the writing of a column for a New York newspaper and working on Columbia University’s Columbia Encyclopedia.  She was a member of Solebury Friends Meeting in Pennsylvania for many years until her death in 1964.

       There are more reasons why I don't embrace mainstream Christianity...many of them issues I have with the theology behind it all, let alone the sometimes poor social justice record.   Given what I have learned about it, it seems to me that Christianity is NOT so much an organic religion born of the experiences of the Jewish people, but a mishmash, a mutt, a combination of Jewish lore, Greek mysticism, and Mithraic/Zoroastrian tradition.   And that to me strongly suggests that this whole business about the Virgin Birth and a Savior and the very existence of Jesus and all that, are forfeit.   In other words, it's NOT eternal truth. It's all man-made. Every bit of it. It's not a product of subjective experience at all, it's not "real" in the way a tree is real in that it was born of the very Earth, its Mother.   It's not real in the way that a robot isn't real like a human being is. Make sense?  And quite often I do wonder if it's possible to "reclaim" it at all, given that there was nothing there to claim to begin with.  Yes, to me its very existence is questionable. And the human mind is perfectly capable of devising a "sacred text" such as the Bible, to answer any questions about its veracity. Circular reasoning, yes. But people accept that from it! And I can't see why. I always come back to the "consider your source" argument. OF COURSE the Christian church wants to maintain its status as the world's most powerful religion. OF COURSE they're going to manipulate every inch of information to maintain that position!   It's like my ex. OF COURSE he wouldn't own up to whether or not he was having cyber affairs or seeking new partners online. He didn't want to lose me, until he had something else lined up.  See how that works???? It's all suspect to me.  That's why over the last several years, I've come to think that the Heathen religions were more  sincere.  They don't have a position of power to defend. They're not out to win votes, as it were.   And this is what makes it so very, very hard for me to believe that there's any truth at all to Christianity. One can find the same spiritual values it advocates in other paths that don't have an agenda, that aren't defending its position in the world.

        Jesus said to his disciples,  "If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you."   -Matthew 17:20 (NRSV)  WE live near snow-capped Mount Robson, the highest mountain in the Canadian Rockies. That mountain would be impossible to move.  Sometimes our problems can seem as big and as immovable as Mount Robson. Take the Bible story about the man whose son was very sick. In desperation he brought the boy to the disciples, but they were unable to cure the man's son.  Next, the heartsick father knelt before Jesus and begged for help. Jesus answered, "All things can be done for the one who believes." The man pleaded, asking for help that he might believe more. Jesus healed the boy. (See Mark 9:14-27.)  This story tells us not to look at our mountain-sized problems but to look to Christ for mercy and help. Jesus' parable of the mustard seed says that even a weak faith can do gigantic things because it connects us to God. We do not have to face our mountains alone. Christ is as near as a prayer.    Today's Prayer   Thank you, Lord Jesus, for helping us with our mountainous problems. Remind us that we never face those problems alone. Amen.  Even weak faith has great power because it connects us to God.

       I found this on ChristianMystics.com:    Born at Böckelheim on the Nahe, 1098; died on the Rupertsberg near Bingen, 1179; feast 17 September. The family name is unknown of this great seeress and prophetess, called the Sibyl of the Rhine. The early biographers give the first names of her parents as Hildebert and Mechtildis (or Mathilda), speak of their nobility and riches, but give no particulars of their lives.  Later writers call the saint Hildegard of Böckelheim, of Rupertsberg, or of Bingen. Legends would make her a Countess of Spanheim. J. May (Katholik. XXXVII, 143) shows from letters and other documents that she probably belonged to the illustrious family of Stein, whose descendants are the present Princes of Salm.  Her father was a soldier in the service of Meginhard, Count of Spanheim. Hildegard was a weak and sickly child, and in consequence received but little education at home. Her parents, though much engaged in worldly pursuits, had a religious disposition and had promised the child to the service of God.   At the age of eight she was placed under the care of Jutta, sister of Count Meginhard, who lived as a recluse on the Disenberg (or Disibodenberg, Mount of St, Disibod) in the Diocese of Speyer. Here also Hildegard was given but little instruction since she was much afflicted with sickness, being frequently scarcely able to walk and often deprived even of the use of her eyes. She was taught to read and sing the Latin psalms, sufficient for the chanting of the Divine Office, but never learned to write.   The life of Hildegard as child, religious, and superioress was an extraordinary one. Left much to herself on account of her ill health, she led an interior life, trying to make use of everything for her own sanctification. From her earliest years she was favoured with visions. She says of herself:   "Up to my fifteenth year I saw much, and related some of the things seen to others, who would inquire with astonishment, whence such things might come. I also wondered and during my sickness I asked one of my nurses whether she also saw similar things. When she answered no, a great fear befell me. Frequently, in my conversation, I would relate future things, which I saw as if present, but, noting the amazement of my listeners, I became more reticent."   This condition continued to the end of her life. Jutta had noticed her gifts and made them known to a monk of the neighbouring abbey, but, it seems, nothing was done at the time. When about forty years of age Hildegard received a command to publish to the world what she saw and heard. She hesitated, dreading what people might think or say, though she herself was fully convinced of the Divine character of the revelations. But, continually urged, rebuked, and threatened by the inner voice, she manifested all to her spiritual director, and through him to the abbot under whose jurisdiction her community was placed.   Then a monk was ordered to put in writing whatever she related; some of her nuns also frequently assisted her. The writings were submitted to the bishop (Henry, 1145-53) and clergy of Mainz, who pronounced them as coming from God. The matter was also brought to the notice of Eugene II (1145-53) who was at Trier in 1147. Albero of Chiny, Bishop of Verdun, was commissioned to investigate and made a favourable report. Hildegard continued her writings.   Crowds of people flocked to her from the neighbourhood and from all parts of Germany and Gaul, to hear words of wisdom from her lips, and to receive advice and help in corporal and spiritual ailments. These were not only from the common people, but men and women of note in Church and State were drawn by tbe report of her wisdom and sanctity.  Around 1150 Hildegard moved her growing convent from Disibodenberg, where the nuns lived alongside the monks, to Bingen about 30 km north, on the banks of the Rhine. She later founded another convent, Eibingen, across the river from Bingen. Her remaining years were very productive. She wrote music and texts to her songs, mostly liturgical plainchant honoring saints and Virgin Mary for the holidays and feast days, and antiphons.   There is some evidence that her music and moral play Ordo Virtutum ("Play of Virtues") were performed in her own convent. In addition to Scivias she wrote two other major works of visionary writing Liber vitae meritorum (1150-63) (Book of Life's Merits) and Liber divinorum operum(1163) ("Book of Divine Works"), in which she further expounded on her theology of microcosm and macrocosm-man being the peak of god's creation, man as a mirror through which the splendor of the macrocosm was reflected. Hildegard also authored Physica and Causae et Curae (1150), both works on natural history and curative powers of various natural objects, which are together known as Liber subtilatum ("The book of subtleties of the Diverse Nature of Things").   These works were uncharacteristic of Hildegard's writings, including her correspondences, in that they were not presented in a visionary form and don't contain any references to divine source or revelation. However, like her religious writings they reflected her religious philosophy-that the man was the peak of god's creation and everything was put in the world for man to use.   In the last year of her life Hildegard had to undergo a very severe trial. In the cemetery adjoining her convent a young man was buried who had once been under excommunication. The ecclesiastical authorities of Mainz demanded that she have the body removed. She did not consider herself bound to obey since the young man had received the last sacraments and was therefore supposed to have been reconciled to the Church. Sentence of interdict was placed on her convent by the chapter of Mainz, and the sentence was confirmed by the bishop, Christian (V) Buch, then in Italy.   After much worry and correspondence she succeeded in having the interdict removed. It is said that she died a holy death and was buried in the church of Rupertsberg.    She's another Christian female leader and mystic I find quite inspirational. And there is one thing about being a Unitarian Universalist - I can look to examples like the saints, yet I don't have the Catholic guilt thing going on. Hmmmmm.   Yes, I know, most mainstream Christians would say, "You need to look to Christ, not Hildegard, for inspiration." Well, people such as Hildegard in a way direct me to Christ, and that in a far different way than just doing it myself on my own. These are my teachers...

          Luke 14:15-24 (NRSV)    One of the dinner guests, on hearing this, said to him, "Blessed is anyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!" Then Jesus said to him,  "Someone gave a great dinner and invited many. At the time for the dinner he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited, 'Come; for everything is ready now.' But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, 'I have bought a piece of land, and I must go out and see it; please accept my regrets.' Another said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out; please accept my regrets.' Another said, 'I have just been married, and therefore I cannot come.' So the slave returned and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and said to his slave, 'Go out at once into the streets and lanes of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.' And the slave said, 'Sir, what you ordered has been done, and there is still room.' Then the master said to the slave, 'Go out into the roads and lanes, and compel people to come in, so that my house may be filled. For I tell you, none of those who were invited will taste my dinner.'"    I'm trying to work out what this parable says as well. Sometimes taking things one bit at a time is a little easier.

         Well, I wasn't sure where I should put these thoughts, so I'll put them here.  This recent pregnancy scare of mine got me to thinking about a lot of things, and it sort of ties in with the idea of me learning to not punish myself so much for not being just like Pulchritude or Pandora or any other "empowered woman" I have seen.   Most of this relates specifically to the area of sexuality, but it does expand further than that.  I don't know why it's taken me so long to learn what "self-respect" really is - I'm almost 35 years old and I'm just now getting a glimpse of what that means.   Some may wonder why I ever left Christianity. Well, a big part of it is because I felt very alienated from my own peers in my late high school and early college years. Walking as a Wiccan (at least at first) justified a lot of things for me, including my explorations into bisexuality and all.   I was also being routinely sexually molested by my alcoholic stepfather, and I didn't see why God was allowing that to happen. I think that event is the biggest reason I am where I am today. I left Mom's home, and have had to struggle to earn a living ever since then, and I've never had financial support enough to go back to school.   Anyway, I had to get away from that home. Place - I shouldn't call it a home, not when I lived in such terror there every day. I was so afraid to come "home" at night, because I was certain that there would be another fight, lots of drinking, and no sleep for me YET AGAIN.  Where Mom lives, is no home to me, because I still have that fear to stay where she and her husband are.   So anyway, I became Wiccan. I was looking for something to justify my ego-driven desires.   I DID find something I thought was worthwhile - Goddess spirituality. I became very involved in the women's spirituality movement. I became a local household name in that scene, in fact.   Yeah, there was my 15 minutes of fame. Whoop de doo.  Oh yes, I was striving to BE SOMETHING or BE SOMEONE. I suppose in a way, this could be a natural outgrowth of human creativity and the desire to express oneself - see Maslow's Hierarchy Of Needs - but nevertheless, this is how it manifested itself.  So where in the hell am I going with this, and what does this have to do with my explorations in Christianity?  Part of this involved a lot of wide-ranging sexual experimentation. I've done it all. And of course, at least in the Wiccan scene, the line from the Charge of the Goddess that says "all acts of love and pleasure are My rituals" justifies pretty much anything you want to do with your body.   But I'm coming to a point in my life where I'm figuring out what I'm really looking for. As Tori Amos put it in her song "Crucify" so many years ago:   I've been looking for a Savior in these dirty streets Looking for a Savior beneath these dirty sheets I've been raising up my hands, drive another nail in Just what God needs - one more victim   What I really want, and what I've always wanted, is real, substantial love and acceptance.  I don't need sex.  I'm not looking for that. I'm starting to realize that the Christian position on sexuality isn't necessarily based on something as overly simple as "it's bad, just don't do it."  Thankfully, I grew up Methodist and I don't have a lot of guilt associated with that kind of thing from my childhood. So, I'm a little freer to move around and explore this.  I am starting to think that the Christian attitude on sexuality is based in self-respect, in seeing the gift of sex as something very worthy of respect and a very powerful force, and therefore not something to be treated in an offhand manner.   Absolutley NO ONE I KNOW would even BEGIN to see this, methinks, but it's an avenue I hadn't explored before, and where I was expecting barrenness and rocky throughways, I'm finding green trees to shade my way, and a beautiful thoroughfare.   Now, Jesus didn't talk about homsexuality specifically that we know of, and in looking at the overall pattern of the kinds of things he talked about, it seems to me that he likely had better things on his mind. The Nazarene seemed to be a lot more concerned with treating people with compassion, especially as evidenced in the way he handled the situation with the adulteress.   Now, then, there are times when I think to myself, "Why can't Paganism and Wicca and all that take more of an attitude about relationships and sexuality like Christianity does?" You don't have to be Christian OR Pagan OR Wiccan OR anything at all to simply have a great deal of respect for yourself as a person and your body and the gift of your sexuality.   But given what the Pagan world has become lately - a clearinghouse for bitter former Christians (how many bitter former Jews does one see becoming Pagan - not many) - it seems that Pagans and Wiccans just want to do whatever is opposite of what Christianity would have them do.  And they don't even bother to sit down and really ponder WHY Christianity has certain guidelines. Oh, they think they do, but they put it down to "they were just suppressing Pagan religions, so they did it first, they did everything opposite Pagans just as a reactionary thing."  Is it not possible that perhaps there can be some spiritual value in these things, in controlling and focusing the vast power that is sexuality for higher purposes? Have the Christian mystics who have studied these things for centuries wasted their efforts?  I'd like to find a synthesis of woman-affirming spirituality with Christian attitudes of self-respect and self-control. Funny. Many Pagans and Wiccans can accept stringent self-control from a Zen master. But let it come from a Christian and the view changes; the Christian is seen as being repressive, the Zen master as enlightened.   Even as I write this, I'm getting articles in my email about the evil conservative Christians who are restricting everything, censoring everything, all in the name of either "national security" or "community decency."  I'm sure that most who are sending me these articles would think I'm shading in the direction of the conservatives if they read this thing I writing now. Maybe.   But I speak from a perspective of figuring out what I want in my life. There's room enough here for everyone, it seems to me, in this great country. Let people do their own thing. But let me also do MY own thing.   Dating Joe opened my eyes to a lot of things, and I'm still not settled in my mind about it all. There's a lot about him I strongly admire. He isn't afraid to color outside the lines and try new things. He can be an innovate thinker and is ever willing to defend freedom to explore, to learn. It seems that he probably thinks that his own former religion, Catholicism, also supports learning and intellectual power. He himself had planned on becoming a Jesuit priest, so that he might learn and be able to teach other young people coming up behind him.   His is a powerful presence, a fine mind.   But he doesn't always turn it to what I think are the most beneficial ideas. They aren't things I want in my world, in my life.   Yeah, maybe in a way I'm shading a little more in the conservative direction, at least with regards to my personal life. I do tend to be somewhat astrologically minded, and given that I have Capricorn on my 1st House and Cancer on my 7th House, my conservative streak doesn't really surprise me.   Perhaps I am exploring a form of a Middle Path (as the Buddha would call it). Perhaps I see that extremism in either direction can be unhealthy, and I need to work out a balance in my own life.   This is why I look for examples of female leadership in Christianity. I often struggle with poor self-esteem, and having examples like this really helps me a lot. Any psychologist worth his or her salt would say this isn't a bad thing, if it helps me feel more capable, more confident, more valuable.   And I don't go in for this business of "I'm a horrible awful sinner." I DO make mistakes, but that doesn't mean I'm inherently worthless. That's about the most psychologically unhealthy position to take, and I'm not going to go there.   Better to take the position of, I am so beautiful and worthwhile in the eyes of God that He sent His son to die for me - how valuable must I be in His eyes! If He didn't care about me, if He didn't think I was worth it, would this have happened at all?? No. Not likely.   "For God so LOVED the world..."  He LOVED the world. He didn't hate it. There's a MYSTERY there that needs pondering.   Anyway, there's my stray thoughts. Probably none of it made any sense at all, but I had to try and get it out, out, out.

       I have long been fascinated by exemplary female leadership under Christ, and one name that really got my attention was that of Juliana of Norwich...here is a blurb on her from the New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia:   English mystic of the fourteenth century, author or recipient of the vision contained in the book known as the "Sixteen Revelations of Divine Love". The original form of her name appears to have been Julian. She was probably a Benedictine nun, living as a recluse in an anchorage of which traces still remain in the east part of the churchyard of St. Julian in Norwich, which belonged to Carrow Priory. According to her book, this revelation was "shewed" to her on 8 or 14 May (the readings differ), 1373, when she was thirty years and a half old. This would refer her birth to the end of 1342. Her statement, that "for twenty years after the time of this shewing, save three months, I had teaching inwardly", proves that the book was not written before 1393. An early fifteenth-century manuscript, recently purchased for the British Museum from the Amherst library, states that she "yet is on life, Anno Domini 1413". It is probable that this is the manuscript cited by Francis Blomefield, the eigtheenth-century historian of Norfolk, and that a misreading of the date led to the statement that she was still living in 1442. Attempts have been made to identify her with Lady Julian Lampet, the anchoress of Carrow, references concerning legacies to whom occur in documents from 1426 to 1478; but this is manifestly impossible. The newly-discovered manuscript differs considerably from the complete version hitherto known, of which it is a kind of condensation, lacking the beginning and the end. Only three, much later, manuscripts of the fuller text are known to exist. The earliest, in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris (from which the book was first edited by Serenus de Cressy in 1670), dates from the sixteenth century; the other two, both in the British Museum and not independent of each other, belong to the seventeenth. The better of the latter is evidently a copy of a much earlier original.   Whatever be their precise date, these "Revelations", or "Shewings", are the most perfect fruit of later medieval mysticism in England. Juliana described herself as a "simple creature unlettered" when she received them; but, in the years that intervened between the vision and the composition of the book, she evidently acquired some knowledge of theological phraseology, and her work appears to show the influence of Walter Hilton, as well as neo-Platonic analogies, the latter probably derived from the anonymous author of the "Divine Cloud of Unknowing". There is one passage, concerning the place in Christ's side for all mankind that shall be saved, which argues an acquaintance with the letters of St. Catherine of Siena. The psychological insight with which she describes her condition, distinguishing the manner of her vision and recognizing when she has to deal with a mere delusion, is worthy of St. Teresa. When seemingly at the point of death, in the bodily sickness for which she had prayed in order to renew her spiritual life, she passes into a trance while contemplating the crucifix, and has the vision of Christ's suffering "in which all the shewings that follow be grounded and joined".   The book is the record of twenty years' meditation upon that one experience; for, "when the shewing, which is given for a time, is passed and hid, then faith keepeth it by grace of the Holy Ghost unto our lives end". More than fifteen years later, she received "in ghostly understanding" the explanation, the key to all religious experience: "What? wouldest thou wit thy Lord's meaning in this thing? Wit it well: Love was His meaning. Who sheweth it thee? Love. Wherefore sheweth He it thee? For love. Hold thee therein, thou shalt wit more in the same. But thou shalt never wit therein other without end." With this illumination, the whole mystery of Redemption and the purpose of human life become clear to her, and even the possibility of sin and the existence of evil does not trouble her, but is made "a bliss by love". This is the great deed, transcending our reason, that the Blessed Trinity shall do at the last day: "Thou shalt see thyself that all manner of thing shall be well." Like St. Catherine, Juliana has little of the dualism of body and soul that is frequent in the mystics. God is in our "sensuality" as well as in our "substance", and the body and the soul render mutual aid: "Either of them take help of other till we be brought up into stature, as kind worketh." Knowledge of God and knowledge of self are inseparable: we may never come to the knowing of one without the knowing of the other. "God is more nearer to us than our own soul", and "in falling and rising we are ever preciously kept in one love." She lays special stress upon the "homeliness" and "courtesy" of God's dealings with us, "for love maketh might and wisdom full meek to us." With this we must correspond by a happy confidence; "failing of comfort" is the "most mischief" into which the soul can fall. In the Blessed Virgin the Lord would have all mankind see how they are loved. Throughout her revelation Juliana submits herself to the authority of the Church: "I yield me to our mother Holy Church, as a simple child oweth."   Sometimes the stories of saints like this prove to be very motivating and inspirational to me, especially those of women leaders and saints. For years and years, I have thought that Christianity was unfriendly to female leadership...but I'm starting to see that "leadership" is not only defined in one way, that being "serving as an ordained minister/priest" or something like that.  There is no reason to think that Christ would have been unfriendly to women or disallowed them into the life of the Spirit. He seemed to have a more transcendent attitude about things like that. Naturally, those who are more conservative may argue with this. But something about that idea feels right.   More to come...

         Sometimes I have difficulty putting certain insights into words, but I am nevertheless inclined to try, so here is a verse from the book of John to get started:    Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh.    John 6:47-51   I have a feeling this requires great meditation and sensitivity, and I'm not as knowledgeable on the Bible as I used to be.   "I am the bread of life." What does that statement mean? This to me indicates that he's saying that when you do things the way he does, you are partaking of something that will serve you, feed you, nourish you in ways that other more temporal ways will not. This seems to be a very, very strongly mystical passage, especially given that last statement, specifically "...the bread with I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh."

       I'm going to be using this blog to keep information here about my explorations in liberal Christianity. I don't know how well this will work, but I have to give it a shot. &nbsp; I figure, it's part of my personal religious history as it is, so I might as well make attempts to come to peace with it. And it's hard, given that the conservatives are trying to define what a real Christian supposedly is.  &nbsp; I don't want them to have the power to do that. I want to have that power to define what a real Christian is for myself.  &nbsp; OK so I'd better start posting, then.

      VATICAN CITY (AP) — The Vatican assailed radical feminism for what it views as efforts to erase differences between men and women, warning in a document released Saturday that the movement threatens the traditional family based on a mother and a father.    The document approved by the Pope reiterates the church's prohibition on women becoming priests.    Such a push for equality, the Vatican said, makes "homosexuality and heterosexuality virtually equivalent, in a new model of polymorphous sexuality."   The warning came in a 37-page document addressed to bishops on the role of women in the church, the latest salvo in a Vatican campaign to protect what it calls the Christian family. It has previously denounced same-sex marriages and called on politicians of all religions to block their legal recognition.   Drawn up by the Vatican's orthodoxy chief Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger and approved by Pope John Paul II, the document reiterates the Roman Catholic Church's prohibition on women becoming priests but said this in no way hampers a woman's access "to the heart of Christian life."   Reflecting John Paul's positions during his 25-year papacy, the document said women should not be stigmatized or penalized financially for wanting to be housewives. "Indeed, a just valuing of the work of women within the family is required."   But it also said that women who choose to work should be granted an appropriate work schedule and "not have to choose between relinquishing their family life or enduring continual stress."   The document reserved its toughest language for what it called recent "new approaches to women's issues," saying an emerging tendency is that "to avoid the domination of one sex or the other, their differences tend to be denied, viewed as mere effects of historical and cultural conditioning."   "The obscuring of the difference or duality of the sexes has enormous consequences on a variety of levels," the document said, asserting it has inspired ideologies that "call into question the family, in its natural two-parent structure of mother and father."   It also warned of challenges to fundamentals of church teaching, saying the blurring of differences "would consider as lacking in importance and relevance the fact that the Son of God assumed human nature in its male form."   The document — "On the Collaboration of Men and Women in the Church in the World" — addressed what it said were "certain currents of thought which are often at variance with the authentic advancement of women." Instead, what the church seeks is "active collaboration between the sexes precisely in the recognition of the difference between man and woman."   In stressing that men and women are different, the document said, "From the first moment of their creation, man and woman are different, and will remain so for eternity."   But it said the "temporal and earthly expression of sexuality is transient," and cited Scripture suggesting that a married couple's existence in heaven would be celibate.

       By Mary Steichen Calderone   “Who comprises mankind?” Everyone, men, women, and children.  “Who comprises womankind?” Women.  “Why the separate-but-equal term womankind, as if women were a sub-species?” Why, indeed?  “Why not use humankind to mean men, women, and children, and mankind only as the equivalent of womankind?” Why not?  “In a large southern city I noticed in some of the older public buildings that there were separate washrooms still labeled ‘colored women’ and ‘white ladies’.” Separate but never equal.  “Didn’t that seem to black women like an insult?” It surely did.  “If the signs had read ‘colored ladies’ and ‘white women,’ wouldn’t black women have felt just as much put down?” Maybe more so.  “Then what about the washroom signs I saw in a large modern building—these signs read ‘Men’ and ‘Ladies’.” Same kind of put down, by sex instead of color.   Being a Quaker lays on one the responsibility for engaging in a continuing internal process of finding out what one really believes in, and relentlessly tracking down one’s own bigotries, prejudices, inconsistencies, blindnesses, and refusals to recognize truth and accept it as such. Conversations with oneself like the above are part and parcel of that process.  It is a kind of gadfly one carries around within one as a Friend — but gladly. If one cannot achieve such open conversations with oneself, it is certain that communication with God will not be open.  Friends have always been especially sensitive to and questioning about the ways in which human beings relate to each other, in a continuing reexamination of their own inner and outer relationships. This consistent component of Quakerism has resulted in the equally consistent and insistent habit Friends have of looking upon treating all human beings as persons, regardless of age, color, economic status, religion, occupation, or gender.  “Walk cheerfully over the land, seeking that of God in everyone” . . . George Fox never assumed that spiritual development was the sole province of men. Men and women Friends have always shared their responsibility, ministry, and accomplishment, as well as their seeking and suffering. Mary Dyer was hanged for persisting in her right to be a Quaker. Elizabeth Fry initiated one of the longestheld Friends’ concerns — prison reform. Friends were among the first to educate men and women equally. Some of the women’s movement’s great heroines are Quakers — Lucretia Mott and Susan B. Anthony, leading abolitionists and feminists, and Alice Paul, author of the women’s rights amendment.  To Friends, a woman is first and foremost a person; as it happens, a female one, but a person in her own right. As such, she is separate and equal to, but not the same as a man, who is a person in his own right.  Friends perceive “personhood” as uniquely human. It is bestowed upon us as humans, by God. It is a gift claimable by each of us on behalf of ourselves, but only as we work to make it available to all others. Because Quakers recognize that the process of change starts at home, within oneself, the struggle for “personhood” is an individual one that moves toward achievement only as one helps others achieve theirs.  Today we see a rising of women in groups, acting on behalf of themselves as individuals and collectively, but not often enough on behalf of men. There are probably two main reasons, both hopefully moving into past history, for this one-sided concern by women.  The first one lies in the undoubted sexism of males. Collectively, throughout centuries, men controlled women in all of their activities, by any number of subtle and not-so-subtle devices — legal, social, economic, or psychological. Women today are quite rightly identifying and resisting these devices. Happily, so are some men on behalf of women, in recognition that these devices have served both sexes very poorly.  The second reason is perhaps a general unawareness of how shackled men have become by their own self-forged bonds. Consider the terrible demand the “male role” makes on male human beings: they must wage war on each other, be strong and never weep, brave and never admit to fear, achieve “success” at all costs, bear the brunt of the economic responsibilities for their families, be able always to “score” sexually with women. And consider how many things they have been prevented from being or doing because it was “unmasculine:” dancing, cooking, being intimately involved in raising their children, being affectionate to their male friends, etc. It is always risky to generalize, but these things are probably true for many men within the Society of Friends, as well as in society at large.  One hardly thinks of Friends, men or women, as revolutionaries and, in truth, their outer demeanor, comportment, and life style have tended to be quite conservative. But on major social issues — slavery, peace, alternative service during war, religious ecumenicism, racial equality — on such issues Quaker concern and conscience come on strong. Quaker voices are usually heard loud and clear “speaking truth to power.”  Friends can witness to the need of males, as well as of females, for liberation on many fronts simply as human beings. The significance of revolutions never lies in what they are against, but in what they are for.  And, despite some objections to tactics, it is clear that Friends have much to gain from the women’s movement in our own search for “personhood” for all people. Behind the rhetoric and the clamor is a heartfelt and justified plea from women on behalf of women, to be allowed to become full human beings, with maximum possible fulfillment. Clearly, humankind will not be able to find and witness to that of God in each of us until its major elements—men and women—perceive and witness to that of God in themselves and in each other. This must be in the course of all of their daily relationships, whether in the family, at work, in recreation, or worship.

       Pope attacks 'lethal effects' of feminists on family life  By Nicholas Pyke 01 August 2004    Feminist thinkers have hit back at the Catholic Church after a Vatican statement criticised the female liberation movement and insisted that men and women are fundamentally different.  Published yesterday in the form of a letter to all Catholic bishops, the statement says that feminism can persuade women to become "adversaries of men" and that this can have "lethal effects in the structure of the family".  The 37-page document was signed by the hardline conservative thinker Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who heads the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and was approved by Pope John Paul II.  It said women should be respected and have equal rights in the workplace, that but differences between the sexes must be recognised. It criticised feminist attempts to erase gender differences, saying they have "inspired ideologies which, for example, call into question the family in its natural two-parent structure of mother and father, and make homosexuality and heterosexuality virtually equivalent".  The Vatican called for greater recognition of motherhood and urged society to recognise caring for children as real work. Yet women's access to positions of authority should not be limited, it said. Governments should make it easier for women to hold jobs without "relinquishing their family life".  Erin Pizzey, founder of the international women's refuge movement, said: "I don't think the Catholic Church - whose own priests and bishops cannot marry - is in a position to make such statements. It is one of the most emotionally illiterate organisations I know, and they need to put their own house in order first."  Angela Phillips, a lecturer at Goldsmiths College, London, said: "Social changes are uncomfortable for people who are part of structures of a previous society, and so they try to maintain the status quo that women have fought against."  The letter, titled "On the collaboration of men and women in the Church and the World", is an attempt to take account of the changing role of women. Catherine Pepinster, editor of The Tablet, a liberal Catholic weekly, said that the document is less "anti-feminist" than the hostile reaction suggests. In Vatican terms, it is a breakthrough because it recognises the wider debate, she said.  "It does emphasise that there's a physical difference that you can't deny or ignore between men and women. It talks about men and women being complementary. But that's not the same as saying women should be subservient or acquiescent," she said.  "Much as people may want to welcome what this document has got to say, many would also like to have seen more recognition for the role of women in the Church. We're starting to see that, but only very recently."  It is an irony, she said, that much of the document has been informed by feminist thinkers - but this fact is not acknowledged by the Vatican.

By the way kerry abortion is not a good thing!!! if people would use there brains for once and use a condom we shouldnt need to make abortion 100%legal!! USE YOUR BRAINS PEOPLE!!!! Bush, to me, has done a great job at being president! and i think he will do a great job 4 years more! Kerry kan kiss my ass!"  Here's my response:  My first note: "we dont need anymore homework or disaplin!"  Apparently we do, because you can't even spell "discipline."   My second note: Oh dear Lord, looking at ALL the spelling errors here, you remind me of an inbred show dog who doesn't have two brain cells to rub together to get a spark. YOU are one of the reasons why Bush should NOT be re-elected, quite frankly.   Oh, you're from TexASS. I should have known. Uneducated redneck. That explains everything.    My third note: "if they werent so stupid and maybe didnt drop out of skool they would be in the same spot my parents are now!"  Maybe if you'd shut up and pay attention, you'd realize that it's more of a case of, some of us don't have wealthy parents like you, where Mummy and Daddy can pay for everything, put kid through college, and everything is hunky dory.  I know of one woman who would LIKE to complete her education but HAD to leave home because she was facing sexual abuse there, and has been struggling to survive ever since. Just working full time trying to keep bills paid and all has prevented her from returning to college. It's not that she "dropped out of school" (another word you spelled wrong, by the way). She graduated high school. But two years into college she had to leave home for her own safety.  But I suppose you're too much of a dumbass to think of those things. It's not always a case of people are too LAZY. In fact, quite often, it's the opposite - they're working too hard to just get by.   You need to pull your head out of your ass and look around at life some more before you go making statements like that.  I can say this because I'm that woman who is struggling to survive and had to leave home because my stepfather was molesting me.   Bite me, you spoiled Republican brat.   My fourth note:  You don't have any clue how easy you've got it, little brat. And it's wealthy people like you who SHOULD be obligated to give something back to society, to make it better and more just and where more people can contribute what they can.  But I expect you're too stupid to understand that idea.   You'll just cop a 'tude and say, "Oh well, I've got money and you don't, sucks to be you!"  I'm putting this all on my other blog on blogger.com for an example of Republican brainlessness. I'm also emailing this to everyone in my church, so that those people who DO have money can see what kind of attitude the kids of the wealthy and privileged are taking with them to the outside world.  I'm making an absolute example of you as the quintessential (big word, do you know what it means) spoiled snotty rich kid.   I put this here to show what kind of attitude is coming from the future voters of America. What a snotty brat.

						    By JANE WARDELL, AP  LONDON (July 29) - A British parliamentary committee called for more troops and resources to be sent to Afghanistan, warning the country could "implode" if its fragile situation is not shored up.  In a wide-ranging report on the war against terrorism, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee said warlord violence and the struggle between U.S.-led troops and insurgents threatens security in Afghanistan.  "There is a real danger if these resources are not provided soon that Afghanistan - a fragile state in one of the most sensitive and volatile regions in the world - could implode, with terrible consequences," the report said.  It added that "there is little, if any, sign of the war on drugs being won," and it called on the British government to explain how it intends to meet targets on reducing poppy cultivation by 75 percent by 2008.  The report came as the French humanitarian group Medecins Sans Frontieres pressed ahead with its plan to leave Afghanistan because of the deteriorating security situation. The agency, known in English as Doctors Without Borders, said it was pulling out because the government had failed to act on evidence that a local warlord ordered the June 2 slaughter of five of its staff.  On Iraq, the report said that the refusal of countries other than the United States and Britain to send significant numbers of troops has produced "serious and regrettable consequences."  It said that the coalition's failure to bring law and order to parts of Iraq had created a vacuum for criminals and members of the former regime, making the country a battle ground for al-Qaida.  Other countries, including Islamic nations, should be encouraged to send troops, the report said, backing a Saudi Arabia proposal that a new, Muslim military force be sent to Iraq.  The plan was raised in talks between Secretary of State Colin Powell and senior Saudi officials in the city of Jeddah. Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi has also expressed support for the idea.

						    By BARBARA EHRENREICH, The New York Times  The Dems couldn't be more butch if they took to wearing codpieces. Every daily convention theme contains the words "strength" or "strong," and even Hillary has been relegated to the role of wife. The idea, according to the pundits, is that with more than half of the voters still favoring Bush as the guy to beat bin Laden, Kerry needs to show that he's macho enough to whup the terrorists. Of course, everyone knows that the macho approach is notably less effective than pixie dust - otherwise, we wouldn't be holding our political conventions under total lockdowns.  Well, I've been reading bin Ladin - Carmen, that is, not her brother-in-law Osama (she spells the last name with an "i") - and I'd like to present a brand-new approach to terrorism, one that turns out to be a lot more consistent with traditional Democratic values. First, let's stop calling the enemy "terrorism," which is like saying we're fighting "bombings." Terrorism is only a method; the enemy is an extremist Islamic insurgency whose appeal lies in its claim to represent the Muslim masses against a bullying superpower.  But as Carmen bin Ladin urgently reminds us in "Inside the Kingdom," one glaring moral flaw in this insurgency, quite apart from its methods, is that it aims to push one-half of those masses down to a status only slightly above that of domestic animals. While Osama was getting pumped up for jihad, Carmen was getting up her nerve to walk across the street in a residential neighborhood in Jeddah - fully veiled but unescorted by a male, something that is illegal for a woman in Saudi Arabia. Eventually she left the kingdom and got a divorce because she didn't want her daughters to grow up in a place where women are kept "locked in and breeding."  So here in one word is my new counterterrorism strategy for Kerry: feminism. Or, if that's too incendiary, try the phrase "human rights for women." I don't mean just a few opportunistic references to women, like those that accompanied the war on the Taliban and were quietly dropped by the Bush administration when that war was abandoned and Afghan women were locked back into their burkas. I'm talking about a sustained and serious effort.  So John and John: Announce plans to pour dollars into girls' education in places like Pakistan, where the high-end estimate for female literacy is 26 percent, and scholarships for women seeking higher education in nations that typically discourage it. (Secular education for the boys wouldn't hurt either.) Expand the grounds for asylum to all women fleeing gender totalitarianism, wherever it springs up. Reverse the Bush policies on global family planning, which condemn 78,000 women yearly to death in makeshift abortions. Lead the global battle against the traffic in women.  I'm not expecting these measures alone to incite a feminist insurgency within the Islamist one. Carmen bin Ladin found her rich Saudi sisters-in-law sunk in bovine passivity, and some of the more spirited young women in the Muslim world have been adopting the head scarf as a gesture of defiance toward American imperialism. We're going to need a thorough foreign policy makeover - from Afghanistan to Israel - before we have the credibility to stand up for anyone's human rights. You can't play the gender card with dirty hands.  If Kerry were to embrace a feminist strategy against the insurgency, he'd have to start by addressing our own dismal record on women's rights. He'd be pushing for the immediate ratification of the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which has been ratified by 169 countries but remains stalled in the Senate. He'd be threatening to break off relations with Saudi Arabia until it acknowledges the humanity of women. And he'd be thundering about the shortage of women in the U.S. Senate and the House, an internationally embarrassing 14 percent. We should be aiming for at least 25 percent representation, the same target the Transitional Administrative Law of Iraq has set for the federal assembly there.  In my dreams, you say, and you're probably right. Maybe Kerry will surprise me in his speech tonight, but it looks as if the Democrats are too frightened of being labeled "girlie men" by the party of Schwarzenegger to do what has to be done. If you want to beat Osama, you've got to start by listening to Carmen.

						    WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A campaign worker for President Bush said on Thursday American workers unhappy with low-quality jobs should find new ones -- or pop a Prozac to make themselves feel better.   "Why don't they get new jobs if they're unhappy -- or go on Prozac?" said Susan Sheybani, an assistant to Bush campaign spokesman Terry Holt.   The comment was apparently directed to a colleague who was transferring a phone call from a reporter asking about job quality, and who overheard the remark.   When told the Prozac comment had been overheard, Sheybani said: "Oh, I was just kidding."   While recent employment growth has buoyed Bush's economic record, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry has argued the new jobs are not as good as those lost due to outsourcing in recent years.   Nearly 1.1 million jobs have been lost since Bush took office in January 2001.

						    By Ron Reagan  It may have been the guy in the hood teetering on the stool, electrodes clamped to his genitals. Or smirking Lynndie England and her leash. Maybe it was the smarmy memos tapped out by soft-fingered lawyers itching to justify such barbarism. The grudging, lunatic retreat of the neocons from their long-standing assertion that Saddam was in cahoots with Osama didn't hurt. Even the Enron audiotapes and their celebration of craven sociopathy likely played a part. As a result of all these displays and countless smaller ones, you could feel, a couple of months back, as summer spread across the country, the ground shifting beneath your feet. Not unlike that scene in The Day After Tomorrow, then in theaters, in which the giant ice shelf splits asunder, this was more a paradigm shift than anything strictly tectonic. No cataclysmic ice age, admittedly, yet something was in the air, and people were inhaling deeply. I began to get calls from friends whose parents had always voted Republican, "but not this time." There was the staid Zbigniew Brzezinski on the staid NewsHour with Jim Lehrer sneering at the "Orwellian language" flowing out of the Pentagon. Word spread through the usual channels that old hands from the days of Bush the Elder were quietly (but not too quietly) appalled by his son's misadventure in Iraq. Suddenly, everywhere you went, a surprising number of folks seemed to have had just about enough of what the Bush administration was dishing out. A fresh age appeared on the horizon, accompanied by the sound of scales falling from people's eyes. It felt something like a demonstration of that highest of American prerogatives and the most deeply cherished American freedom: dissent.   Oddly, even my father's funeral contributed. Throughout that long, stately, overtelevised week in early June, items would appear in the newspaper discussing the Republicans' eagerness to capitalize (subtly, tastefully) on the outpouring of affection for my father and turn it to Bush's advantage for the fall election. The familiar "Heir to Reagan" puffballs were reinflated and loosed over the proceedings like (subtle, tasteful) Mylar balloons. Predictably, this backfired. People were treated to a side-by-side comparison - Ronald W. Reagan versus George W. Bush - and it's no surprise who suffered for it. Misty-eyed with nostalgia, people set aside old political gripes for a few days and remembered what friend and foe always conceded to Ronald Reagan: He was damned impressive in the role of leader of the free world. A sign in the crowd, spotted during the slow roll to the Capitol rotunda, seemed to sum up the mood - a portrait of my father and the words NOW THERE WAS A PRESIDENT.   The comparison underscored something important. And the guy on the stool, Lynndie, and her grinning cohorts, they brought the word: The Bush administration can't be trusted. The parade of Bush officials before various commissions and committees - Paul Wolfowitz, who couldn't quite remember how many young Americans had been sacrificed on the altar of his ideology; John Ashcroft, lip quivering as, for a delicious, fleeting moment, it looked as if Senator Joe Biden might just come over the table at him - these were a continuing reminder. The Enron creeps, too - a reminder of how certain environments and particular habits of mind can erode common decency. People noticed. A tipping point had been reached. The issue of credibility was back on the table. The L-word was in circulation. Not the tired old bromide liberal. That's so 1988. No, this time something much more potent: liar.   Politicians will stretch the truth. They'll exaggerate their accomplishments, paper over their gaffes. Spin has long been the lingua franca of the political realm. But George W. Bush and his administration have taken "normal" mendacity to a startling new level far beyond lies of convenience. On top of the usual massaging of public perception, they traffic in big lies, indulge in any number of symptomatic small lies, and, ultimately, have come to embody dishonesty itself. They are a lie. And people, finally, have started catching on.   None of this, needless to say, guarantees Bush a one-term presidency. The far-right wing of the country - nearly one third of us by some estimates - continues to regard all who refuse to drink the Kool-Aid (liberals, rationalists, Europeans, et cetera) as agents of Satan. Bush could show up on video canoodling with Paris Hilton and still bank their vote. Right-wing talking heads continue painting anyone who fails to genuflect deeply enough as a "hater," and therefore a nut job, probably a crypto-Islamist car bomber. But these protestations have taken on a hysterical, almost comically desperate tone. It's one thing to get trashed by Michael Moore. But when Nobel laureates, a vast majority of the scientific community, and a host of current and former diplomats, intelligence operatives, and military officials line up against you, it becomes increasingly difficult to characterize the opposition as fringe wackos.   Does anyone really favor an administration that so shamelessly lies? One that so tenaciously clings to secrecy, not to protect the American people, but to protect itself? That so willfully misrepresents its true aims and so knowingly misleads the people from whom it derives its power? I simply cannot think so. And to come to the same conclusion does not make you guilty of swallowing some liberal critique of the Bush presidency, because that's not what this is. This is the critique of a person who thinks that lying at the top levels of his government is abhorrent. Call it the honest guy's critique of George W. Bush.   The most egregious examples OF distortion and misdirection - which the administration even now cannot bring itself to repudiate - involve our putative "War on Terror" and our subsequent foray into Iraq.   During his campaign for the presidency, Mr. Bush pledged a more "humble" foreign policy. "I would take the use of force very seriously," he said. "I would be guarded in my approach." Other countries would resent us "if we're an arrogant nation." He sniffed at the notion of "nation building." "Our military is meant to fight and win wars. . . . And when it gets overextended, morale drops." International cooperation and consensus building would be the cornerstone of a Bush administration's approach to the larger world. Given candidate Bush's remarks, it was hard to imagine him, as president, flipping a stiff middle finger at the world and charging off adventuring in the Middle East.   But didn't 9/11 reshuffle the deck, changing everything? Didn't Mr. Bush, on September 12, 2001, awaken to the fresh realization that bad guys in charge of Islamic nations constitute an entirely new and grave threat to us and have to be ruthlessly confronted lest they threaten the American homeland again? Wasn't Saddam Hussein rushed to the front of the line because he was complicit with the hijackers and in some measure responsible for the atrocities in Washington, D. C., and at the tip of Manhattan?   Well, no.   As Bush's former Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, and his onetime "terror czar," Richard A. Clarke, have made clear, the president, with the enthusiastic encouragement of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz, was contemplating action against Iraq from day one. "From the start, we were building the case against Hussein and looking at how we could take him out," O'Neill said. All they needed was an excuse. Clarke got the same impression from within the White House. Afghanistan had to be dealt with first; that's where the actual perpetrators were, after all. But the Taliban was a mere appetizer; Saddam was the entrée. (Or who knows? The soup course?) It was simply a matter of convincing the American public (and our representatives) that war was justified.   The real - but elusive - prime mover behind the 9/11 attacks, Osama bin Laden, was quickly relegated to a back burner (a staff member at Fox News - the cable-TV outlet of the Bush White House - told me a year ago that mere mention of bin Laden's name was forbidden within the company, lest we be reminded that the actual bad guy remained at large) while Saddam's Iraq became International Enemy Number One. Just like that, a country whose economy had been reduced to shambles by international sanctions, whose military was less than half the size it had been when the U. S. Army rolled over it during the first Gulf war, that had extensive no-flight zones imposed on it in the north and south as well as constant aerial and satellite surveillance, and whose lethal weapons and capacity to produce such weapons had been destroyed or seriously degraded by UN inspection teams became, in Mr. Bush's words, "a threat of unique urgency" to the most powerful nation on earth.   Fanciful but terrifying scenarios were introduced: Unmanned aircraft, drones, had been built for missions targeting the U. S., Bush told the nation. "We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud," National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice deadpanned to CNN. And, Bush maintained, "Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists." We "know" Iraq possesses such weapons, Rumsfeld and Vice-President Cheney assured us. We even "know" where they are hidden. After several months of this mumbo jumbo, 70 percent of Americans had embraced the fantasy that Saddam destroyed the World Trade Center.   All these assertions have proved to be baseless and, we've since discovered, were regarded with skepticism by experts at the time they were made. But contrary opinions were derided, ignored, or covered up in the rush to war. Even as of this writing, Dick Cheney clings to his mad assertion that Saddam was somehow at the nexus of a worldwide terror network.   And then there was Abu Ghraib. Our "war president" may have been justified in his assumption that Americans are a warrior people. He pushed the envelope in thinking we'd be content as an occupying power, but he was sadly mistaken if he thought that ordinary Americans would tolerate an image of themselves as torturers. To be fair, the torture was meant to be secret. So were the memos justifying such treatment that had floated around the White House, Pentagon, and Justice Department for more than a year before the first photos came to light. The neocons no doubt appreciate that few of us have the stones to practice the New Warfare. Could you slip a pair of women's panties over the head of a naked, cowering stranger while forcing him to masturbate? What would you say while sodomizing him with a toilet plunger? Is keeping someone awake till he hallucinates inhumane treatment or merely "sleep management"?   Most of us know the answers to these questions, so it was incumbent upon the administration to pretend that Abu Ghraib was an aberration, not policy. Investigations, we were assured, were already under way; relevant bureaucracies would offer unstinting cooperation; the handful of miscreants would be sternly disciplined. After all, they didn't "represent the best of what America's all about." As anyone who'd watched the proceedings of the 9/11 Commission could have predicted, what followed was the usual administration strategy of stonewalling, obstruction, and obfuscation. The appointment of investigators was stalled; documents were withheld, including the full report by Major General Antonio Taguba, who headed the Army's primary investigation into the abuses at Abu Ghraib. A favorite moment for many featured John McCain growing apoplectic as Donald Rumsfeld and an entire table full of army brass proved unable to answer the simple question Who was in charge at Abu Ghraib?   The Bush administration no doubt had its real reasons for invading and occupying Iraq. They've simply chosen not to share them with the American public. They sought justification for ignoring the Geneva Convention and other statutes prohibiting torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners but were loath to acknowledge as much. They may have ideas worth discussing, but they don't welcome the rest of us in the conversation. They don't trust us because they don't dare expose their true agendas to the light of day. There is a surreal quality to all this: Occupation is liberation; Iraq is sovereign, but we're in control; Saddam is in Iraqi custody, but we've got him; we'll get out as soon as an elected Iraqi government asks us, but we'll be there for years to come. Which is what we counted on in the first place, only with rose petals and easy coochie.   This Möbius reality finds its domestic analogue in the perversely cynical "Clear Skies" and "Healthy Forests" sloganeering at Bush's EPA and in the administration's irresponsible tax cutting and other fiscal shenanigans. But the Bush administration has always worn strangely tinted shades, and you wonder to what extent Mr. Bush himself lives in a world of his own imagining.   And chances are your America and George W. Bush's America are not the same place. If you are dead center on the earning scale in real-world twenty-first-century America, you make a bit less than $32,000 a year, and $32,000 is not a sum that Mr. Bush has ever associated with getting by in his world. Bush, who has always managed to fail upwards in his various careers, has never had a job the way you have a job - where not showing up one morning gets you fired, costing you your health benefits. He may find it difficult to relate personally to any of the nearly two million citizens who've lost their jobs under his administration, the first administration since Herbert Hoover's to post a net loss of jobs. Mr. Bush has never had to worry that he couldn't afford the best available health care for his children. For him, forty-three million people without health insurance may be no more than a politically inconvenient abstraction. When Mr. Bush talks about the economy, he is not talking about your economy. His economy is filled with pals called Kenny-boy who fly around in their own airplanes. In Bush's economy, his world, friends relocate offshore to avoid paying taxes. Taxes are for chumps like you. You are not a friend. You're the help. When the party Mr. Bush is hosting in his world ends, you'll be left picking shrimp toast out of the carpet.   All administrations will dissemble, distort, or outright lie when their backs are against the wall, when honesty begins to look like political suicide. But this administration seems to lie reflexively, as if it were simply the easiest option for busy folks with a lot on their minds. While the big lies are more damning and of immeasurably greater import to the nation, it is the small, unnecessary prevarications that may be diagnostic. Who lies when they don't have to? When the simple truth, though perhaps embarrassing in the short run, is nevertheless in one's long-term self-interest? Why would a president whose calling card is his alleged rock-solid integrity waste his chief asset for penny-ante stakes? Habit, perhaps. Or an inability to admit even small mistakes.   Mr. Bush's tendency to meander beyond the bounds of truth was evident during the 2000 campaign but was largely ignored by the mainstream media. His untruths simply didn't fit the agreed-upon narrative. While generally acknowledged to be lacking in experience, depth, and other qualifications typically considered useful in a leader of the free world, Bush was portrayed as a decent fellow nonetheless, one whose straightforwardness was a given. None of that "what the meaning of is is" business for him. And, God knows, no furtive, taxpayer-funded fellatio sessions with the interns. Al Gore, on the other hand, was depicted as a dubious self-reinventor, stained like a certain blue dress by Bill Clinton's prurient transgressions. He would spend valuable weeks explaining away statements - "I invented the Internet" - that he never made in the first place. All this left the coast pretty clear for Bush.   Scenario typical of the 2000 campaign: While debating Al Gore, Bush tells two obvious - if not exactly earth-shattering - lies and is not challenged. First, he claims to have supported a patient's bill of rights while governor of Texas. This is untrue. He, in fact, vigorously resisted such a measure, only reluctantly bowing to political reality and allowing it to become law without his signature. Second, he announces that Gore has outspent him during the campaign. The opposite is true: Bush has outspent Gore. These misstatements are briefly acknowledged in major press outlets, which then quickly return to the more germane issues of Gore's pancake makeup and whether a certain feminist author has counseled him to be more of an "alpha male."   Having gotten away with such witless falsities, perhaps Mr. Bush and his team felt somehow above day-to-day truth. In any case, once ensconced in the White House, they picked up where they left off.   In the immediate aftermath and confusion of 9/11, Bush, who on that day was in Sarasota, Florida, conducting an emergency reading of "The Pet Goat," was whisked off to Nebraska aboard Air Force One. While this may have been entirely sensible under the chaotic circumstances - for all anyone knew at the time, Washington might still have been under attack - the appearance was, shall we say, less than gallant. So a story was concocted: There had been a threat to Air Force One that necessitated the evasive maneuver. Bush's chief political advisor, Karl Rove, cited "specific" and "credible" evidence to that effect. The story quickly unraveled. In truth, there was no such threat.   Then there was Bush's now infamous photo-op landing aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln and his subsequent speech in front of a large banner emblazoned MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. The banner, which loomed in the background as Bush addressed the crew, became problematic as it grew clear that the mission in Iraq - whatever that may have been - was far from accomplished. "Major combat operations," as Bush put it, may have technically ended, but young Americans were still dying almost daily. So the White House dealt with the questionable banner in a manner befitting a president pledged to "responsibility and accountability": It blamed the sailors. No surprise, a bit of digging by journalists revealed the banner and its premature triumphalism to be the work of the White House communications office.   More serious by an order of magnitude was the administration's dishonesty concerning pre-9/11 terror warnings. As questions first arose about the country's lack of preparedness in the face of terrorist assault, Condoleezza Rice was dispatched to the pundit arenas to assure the nation that "no one could have imagined terrorists using aircraft as weapons." In fact, terrorism experts had warned repeatedly of just such a calamity. In June 2001, CIA director George Tenet sent Rice an intelligence report warning that "it is highly likely that a significant Al Qaeda attack is in the near future, within several weeks." Two intelligence briefings given to Bush in the summer of 2001 specifically connected Al Qaeda to the imminent danger of hijacked planes being used as weapons. According to The New York Times, after the second of these briefings, titled "Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside United States," was delivered to the president at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, in August, Bush "broke off from work early and spent most of the day fishing." This was the briefing Dr. Rice dismissed as "historical" in her testimony before the 9/11 Commission.   What's odd is that none of these lies were worth the breath expended in the telling. If only for self-serving political reasons, honesty was the way to go. The flight of Air Force One could easily have been explained in terms of security precautions taken in the confusion of momentous events. As for the carrier landing, someone should have fallen on his or her sword at the first hint of trouble: We told the president he needed to do it; he likes that stuff and was gung-ho; we figured, What the hell?; it was a mistake. The banner? We thought the sailors would appreciate it. In retrospect, also a mistake. Yup, we sure feel dumb now. Owning up to the 9/11 warnings would have entailed more than simple embarrassment. But done forthrightly and immediately, an honest reckoning would have earned the Bush team some respect once the dust settled. Instead, by needlessly tap-dancing, Bush's White House squandered vital credibility, turning even relatively minor gaffes into telling examples of its tendency to distort and evade the truth.   But image is everything in this White House, and the image of George Bush as a noble and infallible warrior in the service of his nation must be fanatically maintained, because behind the image lies . . . nothing? As Jonathan Alter of Newsweek has pointed out, Bush has "never fully inhabited" the presidency. Bush apologists can smilingly excuse his malopropisms and vagueness as the plainspokenness of a man of action, but watching Bush flounder when attempting to communicate extemporaneously, one is left with the impression that he is ineloquent not because he can't speak but because he doesn't bother to think.   George W. Bush promised to "change the tone in Washington" and ran for office as a moderate, a "compassionate conservative," in the focus-group-tested sloganeering of his campaign. Yet he has governed from the right wing of his already conservative party, assiduously tending a "base" that includes, along with the expected Fortune 500 fat cats, fiscal evangelicals who talk openly of doing away with Social Security and Medicare, of shrinking government to the size where they can, in tax radical Grover Norquist's phrase, "drown it in the bathtub." That base also encompasses a healthy share of anti-choice zealots, homophobic bigots, and assorted purveyors of junk science. Bush has tossed bones to all of them - "partial birth" abortion legislation, the promise of a constitutional amendment banning marriage between homosexuals, federal roadblocks to embryonic-stem-cell research, even comments suggesting presidential doubts about Darwinian evolution. It's not that Mr. Bush necessarily shares their worldview; indeed, it's unclear whether he embraces any coherent philosophy. But this president, who vowed to eschew politics in favor of sound policy, panders nonetheless in the interest of political gain. As John DiIulio, Bush's former head of the Office of Community and Faith-Based Initiatives, once told this magazine, "What you've got is everything - and I mean everything - being run by the political arm."   This was not what the American electorate opted for when, in 2000, by a slim but decisive margin of more than half a million votes, they chose . . . the other guy. Bush has never had a mandate. Surveys indicate broad public dissatisfaction with his domestic priorities. How many people would have voted for Mr. Bush in the first place had they understood his eagerness to pass on crushing debt to our children or seen his true colors regarding global warming and the environment? Even after 9/11, were people really looking to be dragged into an optional war under false pretenses?   If ever there was a time for uniting and not dividing, this is it. Instead, Mr. Bush governs as if by divine right, seeming to actually believe that a wise God wants him in the White House and that by constantly evoking the horrible memory of September 11, 2001, he can keep public anxiety stirred up enough to carry him to another term.   Understandably, some supporters of Mr. Bush's will believe I harbor a personal vendetta against the man, some seething resentment. One conservative commentator, based on earlier remarks I've made, has already discerned "jealousy" on my part; after all, Bush, the son of a former president, now occupies that office himself, while I, most assuredly, will not. Truth be told, I have no personal feelings for Bush at all. I hardly know him, having met him only twice, briefly and uneventfully - once during my father's presidency and once during my father's funeral. I'll acknowledge occasional annoyance at the pretense that he's somehow a clone of my father, but far from threatening, I see this more as silly and pathetic. My father, acting roles excepted, never pretended to be anyone but himself. His Republican party, furthermore, seems a far cry from the current model, with its cringing obeisance to the religious Right and its kill-anything-that-moves attack instincts. Believe it or not, I don't look in the mirror every morning and see my father looming over my shoulder. I write and speak as nothing more or less than an American citizen, one who is plenty angry about the direction our country is being dragged by the current administration. We have reached a critical juncture in our nation's history, one ripe with both danger and possibility. We need leadership with the wisdom to prudently confront those dangers and the imagination to boldly grasp the possibilities. Beyond issues of fiscal irresponsibility and ill-advised militarism, there is a question of trust. George W. Bush and his allies don't trust you and me. Why on earth, then, should we trust them?   Fortunately, we still live in a democratic republic. The Bush team cannot expect a cabal of right-wing justices to once again deliver the White House. Come November 2, we will have a choice: We can embrace a lie, or we can restore a measure of integrity to our government. We can choose, as a bumper sticker I spotted in Seattle put it, SOMEONE ELSE FOR PRESIDENT.    Ron Reagan is the son of the late Ronald Reagan who was the 40th President Of The United States from 1981 - 1989. The Reagan family has declined to attend the Republican convention this year which will honor Ronald Reagan. Ron Reagan instead choose to address the Democratic convention.

						    GOP gets scolded on recruitment  Naturalization ceremonies in Jacksonville are to be relocated after complaints that GOP activists registered new citizens as Republicans.  BY GARY FINEOUT AND ALFONSO CHARDY  The citizenship ceremony in Jacksonville seemed to go off as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people going home as new Americans.  Just before the new citizens left the June 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in urged them to stop by a voter registration table -- a not uncommon sight at naturalization ceremonies.  But this table was unusual: Those handing out forms were Republican volunteers -- and the party affiliation box had been checked off ahead of time to make all of the new voters members of the GOP.  All of it was suspicious to Linda Cross, who was there to watch her husband, Dario Cruz, take his citizenship oath. Cross asked one of the women sitting at the table in the foyer of the University of North Florida auditorium whether there were any forms that left the party affiliation blank.  NO CHOICE OFFERED  She was told no.  ''They said they didn't have any forms that weren't checked,'' Cross recalled. 'She said, `We're a Republican organization.' ''  Now, after complaints from Democrats, immigration officials say the table was unauthorized and that the incident will mean delays in swearing in naturalized citizens in Jacksonville. Top Republican party officials insist they did not authorize the voter registration effort, but Democrats remain skeptical as to how a Republican group would know when and where to show up.  ''We don't know if this is happening anywhere else,'' said Ann Farra, voter registration director for the Duval County Democratic Party. ``Our other concern is, how long has this been going on?''  Jack Bulger, the Florida district director for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, told The Herald that the group was not authorized to pass out pre-checked voter registration forms. He said that from now on, naturalization ceremonies in Jacksonville will be held at the local immigration office or in a federal courthouse, where immigration officials can have better control of the premises.  ''The outcome of all this is that I understand better than anybody the sensitivity of voter registration, at any time . . . and I will not permit the naturalization process to be politicized in any way,'' Bulger said. ``It will not happen.''  A top immigration official sent an e-mail last week to aides to Florida's two senators to alert them to the naturalization ceremony changes, ``because of a recent flap regarding the registration of voters.''  A spokesman for U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson said Wednesday that the Melbourne Democrat wants assurances that those eligible for citizenship will not endure lengthy delays because of the change.  Bulger said no other cities in Florida have reported any similar occurrences and that no limitations on where to hold citizenship ceremonies will affect other cities. Only one ceremony in Jacksonville will be delayed a few days, he said, to accommodate the change of venue from the university campus to the Jacksonville immigration office.  Joseph Agostini, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Florida, said that voter registration efforts are directed by local clubs and local party organizations and that the state party had no involvement in the June 29 registration drive.  ''At the loca l level, volunteers often attend these kind of events to register voters,'' said Agostini, who said he had registered voters at swearing-in ceremonies in Hillsborough County in past years.  Dick Carlberg, assistant supervisor of elections for Duval County, said that on the basis of complaints from Democrats, the elections office set aside 36 registration forms from June 29 that were dropped off by the Duval County Republican Party. It is a third-degree felony in Florida to alter voter registration forms without the voter's consent.  But he said those registrations were processed after the office got an opinion from the division of elections that nothing illegal had happened. Carlberg said that while the forms were pre-checked Republican, some voters had crossed it out and selected another party affiliation, indicating they understood they had a choice.  ''At worst it was unethical,'' Carlberg said. ``It depends on your point of view. But illegal, no.''  Bulger, the immigration chief in Florida, said that immigration officials typically allow nonpartisan groups or local election offices to register voters at ceremonies and no one thought to question the identity of the people who showed up to register voters in Jacksonville.  'In this particular incident, when our people were almost ready to start the ceremony, a group came in and had a nondescript sign that said `voter registration,' and our people made the assumption, without verifying it, that it was one of the nonpartisan groups we typically have dealt with,'' he said. ``Later, someone approached one of our people and said they thought they had received a form that was pre-checked. That would be inappropriate.''  SOMEONE NAMED  While immigration officials said that the organization that offered voter registration cards to new citizens was ''unknown,'' a story about the initial controversy in The Florida Times-Union identified one of those registering voters as being a Republican volunteer named Millie McLean.  McLean was identified last October as being in charge of voter registration drives for the Republican Women's Club of Duval County Federated, one of dozens of clubs statewide that are chartered by the Republican Party of Florida. McLean refused to answer questions from The Herald, but she denied any wrongdoing to the Times-Union.  Judith Albertelli, a Jacksonville resident and president of the Florida Federation of Republican Women, said she had been told that the women's club itself did not sponsor the voting booth at the June 29 naturalization ceremony.  Herald staff writer Mary Ellen Klas contributed to this report.

						    By TERESA HAMPTON Editor, Capitol Hill Blue July 28, 2004  President George W. Bush is taking powerful anti-depressant drugs to control his erratic behavior, depression and paranoia, Capitol Hill Blue has learned.  The prescription drugs, administered by Col. Richard J. Tubb, the White House physician, can impair the President’s mental faculties and decrease both his physical capabilities and his ability to respond to a crisis, administration aides admit privately.  “It’s a double-edged sword,” says one aide. “We can’t have him flying off the handle at the slightest provocation but we also need a President who is alert mentally.”    Angry Bush walked away from reporter's questions.  Tubb prescribed the anti-depressants after a clearly-upset Bush stormed off stage on July 8, refusing to answer reporters' questions about his relationship with indicted Enron executive Kenneth J. Lay.  “Keep those motherfuckers away from me,” he screamed at an aide backstage. “If you can’t, I’ll find someone who can.”  Bush’s mental stability has become the topic of Washington whispers in recent months. Capitol Hill Blue first reported on June 4 about increasing concern among White House aides over the President’s wide mood swings and obscene outbursts.  Although GOP loyalists dismissed the reports an anti-Bush propaganda, the reports were later confirmed by prominent George Washington University psychiatrist Dr. Justin Frank in his book Bush on the Couch: Inside the Mind of the President. Dr. Frank diagnosed the President as a “paranoid meglomaniac” and “untreated alcoholic” whose “lifelong streak of sadism, ranging from childhood pranks (using firecrackers to explode frogs) to insulting journalists, gloating over state executions and pumping his hand gleefully before the bombing of Baghdad” showcase Bush’s instabilities.  “I was really very unsettled by him and I started watching everything he did and reading what he wrote and watching him on videotape. I felt he was disturbed,” Dr. Frank said. “He fits the profile of a former drinker whose alcoholism has been arrested but not treated.”  Dr. Frank’s conclusions have been praised by other prominent psychiatrists, including Dr. James Grotstein, Professor at UCLA Medical Center, and Dr. Irvin Yalom, MD, Professor Emeritus at Stanford University Medical School.  The doctors also worry about the wisdom of giving powerful anti-depressant drugs to a person with a history of chemical dependency. Bush is an admitted alcoholic, although he never sought treatment in a formal program, and stories about his cocaine use as a younger man haunted his campaigns for Texas governor and his first campaign for President.  “President Bush is an untreated alcoholic with paranoid and megalomaniac tendencies,” Dr. Frank adds.  The White House did not return phone calls seeking comment on this article.  Although the exact drugs Bush takes to control his depression and behavior are not known, White House sources say they are “powerful medications” designed to bring his erratic actions under control. While Col. Tubb regularly releases a synopsis of the President’s annual physical, details of the President’s health and any drugs or treatment he may receive are not public record and are guarded zealously by the secretive cadre of aides that surround the President.  Veteran White House watchers say the ability to control information about Bush’s health, either physical or mental, is similar to Ronald Reagan’s second term when aides managed to conceal the President’s increasing memory lapses that signaled the onslaught of Alzheimer’s Disease.  It also brings back memories of Richard Nixon’s final days when the soon-to-resign President wondered the halls and talked to portraits of former Presidents. The stories didn’t emerge until after Nixon left office.  One long-time GOP political consultant who – for obvious reasons – asked not to be identified said he is advising his Republican Congressional candidates to keep their distance from Bush.  “We have to face the very real possibility that the President of the United States is loony tunes,” he says sadly. “That’s not good for my candidates, it’s not good for the party and it’s certainly not good for the country.”   http://www.capitolhillblue.com/artman/publish/article_4921.shtml

						    By DOUGLASS K. DANIEL, AP  WASHINGTON (July 23) - The Republican National Committee has asked Bush-backing Roman Catholics to provide copies of their parish directories to help register Catholics to vote in the November election, a use of personal information not necessarily condoned by dioceses around the country.  In a story posted Thursday on its Web site, the National Catholic Reporter said a GOP official had urged people who attended a Catholic outreach event in January to provide parish directories and membership lists to the political party.  ''Access to these directories is critical as it allows us to identify and contact those Catholics who are likely to be supportive of President Bush's compassionate conservative agenda,'' wrote Martin J. Gillespie, director of Catholic Outreach at the RNC. ''Please forward any directories you are able to collect to my attention.''  The RNC is using the information from parish directories only for its nonpartisan voter registration drive, RNC spokeswoman Christine Iverson told The Associated Press on Thursday. Those efforts target members of other faiths as well as people who belong to nonreligious organizations, she said.  Parish directories often contain personal information about church members, including names of family members, home addresses and phone numbers. Iverson said she did not know if the GOP had sought similar directories from other religious organizations or how many Catholic directories it received in response to Gillespie's request.  Susan Gibbs, the spokeswoman for the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., which oversees 140 parishes in Washington and Maryland, said parish directories publish information only for use among church members and not for use by outside organizations no matter what their purpose.  ''Parish directories are for helping parishioners get to know each other better and are strictly for that purpose. They are not intended to be used for any outside commercial purpose, solicitations or anything else,'' Gibbs said. ''Parish directories or priest directories are not given to outside groups even if it's for a good cause.''  Catholic parishioners provided that personal information with an expectation of what it would be used for, said Rebecca Summers of the office of communications for the Catholic Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Mo., which has more than 90 parishes.  ''I'm not certain under any scenario that we would encourage someone responding to that appeal - for any purpose, whether it would be an environmental cause or any purpose other than what the people volunteered the information for,'' Summers told the AP.  The Catholic Church has its own nonpartisan voter registration initiatives and candidate forums, Gibbs said.

						    In This Digest:  House OKs Gay Marriage Jurisdiction Bill  'Fahrenheit 9/11' Making GOP Nervous     House OKs Gay Marriage Jurisdiction Bill  By MARK SHERMAN, Associated Press Writer   WASHINGTON - Gay marriage opponents wanted more, but House Republicans gave them at least a symbolic election-year victory. Republicans passed legislation in the House on Thursday, 233-194, to prevent federal courts from ordering states to recognize same-sex unions that took place in other states. Democrats objected to the bill as an unconstitutional attack on gays and the federal judiciary to satisfy the GOP's political base.   Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council said the legislation is a welcome interim step. "It provides us the opportunity to isolate some of these judicial rewrites of marriage. Until we can get an amendment to the Constitution, this will keep it from spreading," Perkins said.   Supporters said the House legislation would protect the institution of marriage by reining in federal judges who might otherwise impose gay marriage on states that have banned it. "Marriage is under attack," said Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., referring to the Massachusetts state court decision allowing same-sex marriages.   One after another, Republicans criticized what they called "activist" judges, with one lawmaker comparing the Supreme Court to the Soviet Politburo. Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., responded that Republicans did not complain of judicial activism after the high court's 5-4 ruling that ended ballot recounts in Florida and effectively called the 2000 president election for George W. Bush.   The Bush administration backs the bill, which is not likely to advance in the Senate, but said more is needed. "To fully protect marriage from activist judges, including activist state court judges, the administration also urges Congress to pass ... a constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman," the administration said in a statement.   However, Senate Republicans last week were forced to shelve the marriage amendment for lack of support.   The fallback House bill would strip the Supreme Court and other federal courts of their jurisdiction to rule on challenges to state bans on gay marriages under a provision of the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act. That law defines marriage as between a man and a woman, and says states are not compelled to recognize gay marriages that take place in other states.   Democrats said the bill is an unprecedented attempt to choke off federal judicial review, a claim backed by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.   The effect of the bill would be to single out gays and lesbians, barring them from going into federal court to seek to have their marriages recognized, several Democrats said. Civil rights groups said the bill is unconstitutional for that reason.   "We face no less than a sign on the courthouse door: 'You may not defend your constitutional rights in this court. You may not seek equal protection here,'" said Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., the House's lone declared lesbian. "Today, the 'you' is gay and lesbian citizens. But who would be next?"    Some Republican opponents of the legislation also said they wanted to avoid setting a precedent that could used by a Congress controlled by Democrats to satisfy their allies or by lawmakers who wanted to shield future unconstitutional legislation from federal court review.  ___    The bill is H.R. 3313.  ****************************  'Fahrenheit 9/11' Making GOP Nervous  By MIKE GLOVER, AP  DES MOINES, Iowa (July 22) - Republicans initially dismissed "Fahrenheit 9/11" as a cinematic screed that would play mostly to inveterate Bush bashers. Four weeks and $94 million later, the film is still pulling in moviegoers at 2,000 theaters around the country, making Republicans nervous as it settles into the American mainstream.  "I'm not sure if it moves voters," Republican party consultant Scott Reed said, "but if it moves 3 or 4 percent it's been a success."  Two senior Republicans closely tied to President George W. Bush's White House said the movie from director Michael Moore is seen as a political headache because it has reached beyond the Democratic base. Independents and Republican-leaning voters are likely to be found sitting beside those set to revel in its depiction of a clueless president with questionable ties to the oil industry.  "If you are a naive, uncommitted voter and wander into a theater, you aren't going to come away with a good impression of the president," Republican operative Joe Gaylord said. "It's a problem only if a lot of people see it."  Based on a record-breaking gross of US$94 million through last weekend, theaters already have sold an estimated 12 million tickets to "Fahrenheit 9/11." A Gallup survey conducted July 8-11 said 8 percent of American adults had seen the film at that time, but that 18 percent still planned to see it at a theater and another 30 percent plan to see it on video.  The film has not helped Bush's image overseas either. It won the highest award at May's Cannes Film Festival and received standing ovations in Britain, where it broke the box office record for a documentary in its opening weekend earlier this month by taking in $2.4 million on 132 screens.  More than a third of Republicans and nearly two-thirds of independents told Gallup they had seen or expected to see the film at theaters or on video.  "Fahrenheit 9/11" opened in June mainly in locally owned arts theaters that specialize in obscure films and tiny audiences. Drawn in part by the buzz surrounding the film, people packed the theaters and formed long lines for tickets. Within a week, it was appearing in chain-owned theaters along with "Spider-Man 2," "The Notebook" and other big summer attractions.  When he sat down to watch the film at the Varsity Theater in Des Moines last weekend, Rob Sheesley didn't harbor anti-Bush feelings. Two hours later, he left with conflicted emotions.  "You want to respect the president," Sheesley said. "It raised a lot of questions."  Bush's leadership in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks had impressed retired teacher Lavone Mann, another Des Moines moviegoer. After watching the film, Mann wanted to know more about its claims.  "I guess that I think it makes me want to pursue how much of it is accurate and not just get carried away with one film," she said. "I don't hear Bush and (Vice President Dick) Cheney saying that this is incorrect."  Retired college professor Dennis O'Brien, a Bush voter in 2000 and a movie buff who has seen other Moore films, said "Fahrenheit 9/11" hasn't changed his view of Bush but may well serve a larger purpose by sparking debate.  "Moore forces you to think about the role of oil in the politics of American life," O'Brien said. "This goes back a long way."  In Republican-stronghold Columbia, South Carolina, watching the movie last week at the Columbiana Grande tipped 26-year-old David Wood's support more to the left.  "I don't consider myself a Republican or a Democrat. I just vote for whoever is right for the job," the University of South Carolina student said. "I think most people don't bother to really research, and all they need is something popular to sway them."  Others at the screening in Columbia were put off by what they saw as the film's biased approach to examining Bush and the reasons he took the country to war. For Scott Campbell, 19, the movie reinforced his apathy toward politics.  "We didn't even stay to see the whole thing," Campbell said. "It was one-sided."  Former Iowa Republican Chairman Michael Mahaffey said the movie's impact could be dulled over time. "It's July," he said. "Conventional wisdom will change completely every four or five weeks."  Still, "Fahrenheit 9/11" is likely to gain an even wider audience when it's released on home video in the weeks before Election Day. The Gallup survey found that nearly half of the Republicans and independents who expect to see the film said they were likely to view it on video.  "In all honesty, in a very close election, who knows what will sway the public?" Mahaffey said.  Associated Press writer Jennifer Holland in Columbia, S.C., contributed to this report.

						    By ADAM GOLDMAN, Associated Press Writer   LAS VEGAS - Singer Linda Ronstadt not only got booed, she got the boot after praising filmmaker Michael Moore and his new movie "Fahrenheit 9/11" during a performance.   Before singing "Desperado" for an encore Saturday night, Ronstadt called Moore a "great American patriot" and "someone who is spreading the truth." She also encouraged the audience at the Aladdin hotel-casino to see the documentary about President Bush.  Ronstadt's comments drew loud boos, and some of the 4,500 people in attendance stormed out of the theater. People also tore down concert posters and tossed cocktails into the air.   "It was a very ugly scene," Aladdin President Bill Timmins told The Associated Press. "She praised him and all of a sudden all bedlam broke loose."   Timmins, who is British and was watching the show, said he didn't allow Ronstadt back in her luxury suite afterward and she was escorted off the property.   Ronstadt's antics "spoiled a wonderful evening for our guests and we had to do something about it," Timmins said.   Ronstadt, 58, had been booked to play the Aladdin for only one show.   On Monday, Moore released a letter to The Associated Press that he intends to send to Timmins.   "For you to throw Linda Ronstadt off the premises because she dared to say a few words in support of me and my film, is simply stupid and Un-American," Moore wrote.   Calls to Ronstadt's manager were not immediately returned.   In an interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal before the show, Ronstadt said, "I keep hoping that if I'm annoying enough to them, they won't hire me back."   Timmins said Ronstadt would not sing at the Aladdin again: "As long as I'm here, she's not going to play."   Moore said Timmins owes Ronstadt an apology.   "I have an idea how you can make it up to her — and to the millions of Americans you have offended," Moore wrote. "Invite her back and I'll join her in singing 'America the Beautiful' on your stage. Then I will show 'Fahrenheit 9/11' free of charge to all your guests and anyone else in Las Vegas who wants to see it."   Here is a comment from a friend of mine about this article when asked, "Do you believe this??" "Yes, I not only believe it, I would expect no other outcome in today's AmeriKa.  Linda did nothing wrong.  She exercised her rights as much as Toby Keith, Lee Greenwood, and other such do for the republiFacists they so adore.  The wrongdoers here were the ones who BROKE THE LAW by disturbing the peace, endangering others, almost certainly committing assault (thrown glasses and drink hitting someone constitutes assault), and destroying property.  Instead of having the guilty mob arrested and jailed, (WHERE are all those "Law And Order " types when you need 'em?), Mr Timmins chose to condone and reward and thereby promote law-breaking mob violence, which is essentially TERRORISM on a local scale.  WHERE are all those "Good Ol' Cawntry Sangin' God and Country Homeland Security" types when you need 'em?   I don't have any plans to visit Las Vegas that I know of, but if I do not one dime will go to the Aladdin or any of it's parent or subsidiary business, and furthermore I will send this to that company so that they damn well know why!"  Further editorial from AmericanGoddess: Please note that Timmins is a BRIT, and is on OUR AMERICAN SOIL, dissing OUR AMERICAN RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, and yet is RAKING IN AMERICAN DOLLARS while censoring an AMERICAN PERFORMER. He needs to get over himself. If he doesn't like our freedom and doesn't want to preserve it, let him go back to the UK.

						    July 17, 2004 By Christian Dewar   In the June 21st edition of Time Magazine, the cover story is entitled, "Faith, God and the Oval Office", in which George W. Bush's religious beliefs are contrasted with those of John Kerry. In the same edition, there is an article entitled, "Redefining Torture", in which the origins of the use of torture by our government are traced to the highest levels of Bush's administration. Who would Jesus torture? Apparently, Time Magazine has no sense of irony.   Around 900 US troops have been killed in Iraq. Thousands more are casualties, many missing limbs. Around 12,000 innocent Iraqi civilians are dead. An unknown number of Iraqi conscripts and soldiers died. The "Coalition of the Willing" has sustained death and casualties. Our "Shock and Awe" blitzkrieg has devastated the already damaged infrastructure including plumbing and sewage, insuring that tens, if not hundreds of thousands, more civilians will die of sickness and disease. Our use of the radioactive and toxic depleted uranium munitions will no doubt cause cancer and birth defects among Iraqis and US vets for generations to come.   Meanwhile, the 9/11 Commission has declared that Saddam did not have WMD, he was not linked to Osama or al-Qaeda, he was not behind the World Trade Center attacks and his decimated army posed no imminent threat to the US. Oops!   If you kill one innocent human being it is murder. If you slaughter thousands, it is "regime change."   Accounts of Saddam's ability to attack us with WMD were lies. Shipments of Niger uranium to Iraq were lies. Claims that aluminum tubes were for centrifuges were lies. Stories of drones that could attack the US with chemical and biological weapons were lies. Assertions that Saddam had mobile trucks with WMD were lies. Who would Jesus lie to?   Bush better hope that there is no heaven, no hell and no judgment day.   Ron Reagan Jr. recently commented that while his father believed in God, he didn't wear his religion on his sleeve. While he did not mention Bush by name, most observers assumed that he was talking about the man selected by the Supreme Court to be our president. Bush often uses code words familiar to his critical evangelical base that fly under the radar of mainstream, moderate Christians. Still, it does not seem to be too cynical to believe that Bush's supposed religion is simply a ploy to gain votes from the rubes among fundamentalist Christians. Or if he is a religious man, few genuine Christians would believe that his God was the one they pray to.   What would St. Peter have to say to George Bush once he stands before the Pearly Gates of heaven on judgment day? Has he been a good Christian? Has he led a pious life according to the teachings of Jesus?   In the world of Roy Moore, it is more important for Christians to display their faith by placing a huge granite rock with the Ten Commandments inscribed on it in a court room rather than to follow those tenets of Christianity. For the Bush family, patriotism is displayed by appearing before huge American flags and wrapping themselves in red-white-and-blue bunting even as they chip away at the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Symbols trump substance any day for these Christians and patriots.   According to childhood friends, Bush used to blow up frogs with firecrackers and shoot them with BB guns. As several therapists have pointed out, this cruelty to animals is a trait he shares with many serial killers.   Bush was embroiled in a scandal at Yale when it was discovered that he branded pledges at his fraternity with red-hot wires.   A drunken George W. Bush once challenged his own father to a fight, "mano a mano."   Several therapists have commented about Bush's sadistic tendencies and his lack of empathy. A recent book, "Bush on the Couch; Inside the Mind of the President," written by the respected Justin A. Frank M.D., is one of many attempts to describe Bush's inherent cruelty. The book points out how comfortable Bush is being outside the law, whether it is his two arrests at Yale, his DUI, his apparent AWOL status in the Texas National Guard, alleged insider trading, possible perjury or his reported drug abuse.   Polls report that many of those in the Red States believe that Bush is "likable" and the candidate they would most like to have a beer with. This about a man who mocks and ridicules those with whom he disagrees. A reporter who asks a foreign politician a question in French was derided as being an "internationalist." A citizen who expressed his displeasure with Bush's policies was told, "Who cares what you think?" He makes fun of bald journalists. He has cruel nicknames for aides. He calls Karl Rove, "Turd Blossom."   During his father's presidential campaign. Dubya served as the "loyalty enforcer", the heavy who was brought in to fire or chastise disloyal campaign aides. He once yelled drunken obscenities at reporter Al Hunt in front of his wife and young child for an innocuous statement that he had written about his father. Unaware that his microphone was on, he called a New York Times reporter an asshole. According to White House insiders, his conversations are laced with profanity.   Dick Cheney recently told a respected senator who is critical of his war profiteering to go "fuck yourself." Bush failed to admonish his vice president. Is this a Christian sentiment? Who would Jesus curse?   As governor of Texas, Bush presided over a record number of executions including the mentally ill and juveniles. He mocked born-again Christian Karla Faye Tucker's plea for clemency, "Please don't kill me, Mr. Bush." Many of those sentenced to die had incompetent attorneys, including one who slept through parts of the trial. Bush's legal counsel omitted mitigating circumstances about many of the defendants. Bush reportedly only gave a cursory review of the defendant's legal background.   During the debates with Al Gore, Bush smirked when he mentioned the pending execution of neo-nazis who dragged a black man to his death, even as he spurned the dead man's family who begged the governor to back hate-crime legislation. What part of "Thou Shall Not Kill" doesn't this man understand? What of "vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord"? What of "judge not, least ye be judged"? Are there loop holes and exceptions to the teachings of Christ or the Bible, as there apparently are in US and international law when it comes to torturing detainees?   As a failed business man in the Texas oil business, Bush apparently unloaded around $850,000 in stock before it crashed -- A far greater amount than what Martha Stewart realized in her insider trading scam. Bush was never exonerated, although Bush Senior's cronies at the head of the SEC dropped the investigation. "Thou Shall Not Steal?"   As governor, Bush steered much of the University of Texas's investments to his cronies. He may well have perjured himself in a Texas funeral home scandal. The Texas Ranger's stadium was paid for by taxpayers, although Bush and his cronies realized a huge profit at their expense. They even created a quasi-governmental agency to condemn the soon-to-be valuable private property around the ball field in order to buy the land at fire-sale prices.   As president, his administration has awarded no-bid, cost-plus multi-billion dollar contracts to his campaign contributors. His father has profited from his son's wars as a consultant to Carlyle. Dick Cheney's stock in Halliburton increases in value as the company gouges US taxpayers with inflated invoices and phantom services.   The vice president is being investigated by the SEC. He may be indicted for a felony concerning bribes by Halliburton to corrupt Nigerian officials. Bush's good friend and campaign contributor, "Kenny Boy" Lay has finally made to perp walk. His company defrauded California and his employees lost their careers along with their life savings. The "Golden Rule?" He who has the gold, rules.   Around $20 billion dollars from the sale of Iraqi oil has gone missing. Oil pumped from the Iraqi wells is unmetered. Money allocated for Iraq by the US government is similarly unaccounted for with little oversight.   Are we sure that this war wasn't about oil as ten million protesters alleged before the bombing of Baghdad began? What of the proverb that "it is harder for a rich man to enter heaven than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle?" Bush's tax cuts mostly benefit the richest one per cent of US citizens as the deficit soars to record heights and social programs are gutted. This is compassionate conservative?   What mountain would Jesus strip mine? This administration is giving away America's resources to his wealthy contributors as they despoil the land and strip the forests. The extraction industries dump toxins and pollutants into our water. Mercury from coal mines renders seafood dangerous for pregnant women's unborn children. Death and illnesses are directly linked to pollution. Under Governor Bush, Houston overtook Los Angeles as the country's most polluted city.   This administration is the most vengeful in US history, as Richard Clark, Paul O'Neil and Joe Wilson, among many others, have discovered. Turn the other cheek? If you do, this administration will punch you on the other side of your head.   Cheney voted against sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa. He opposed efforts to free Nelson Mandela. What race would Jesus hate?   Bush seems to also harbor racist tendencies. He recently refused to address the NAACP. He opposes affirmative action. He reportedly collaborated with Lee Atwater on the racist Willie Horton ads. Rove's minions circulated rumors that John McCain fathered an illegitimate black child. Jeb Bush disenfranchised thousands of black voters, most of whom would have supported Al Gore. Asked by a black woman what he would do for blacks if he became governor of Florida, Jeb Bush replied, "Probably nothing." Who would Jesus hate?   John Ashcroft, the attorney general whose department approved the use of torture, is affiliated with neo-confederate, racist groups like the Southern Partisan and the Council of Conservative Citizens, the uptown Ku Klux Klan.   Ashcroft is one of the NRA's strongest supporters. What about beating swords into plowshares? Who would Jesus shoot? What heat would Christ pack?   Both Cheney and Bush fought to pass a constitutional amendment forbidding gay marriages, even though Cheney's daughter is a lesbian. What group of citizens would Jesus hate?   Some of the more strident evangelicals believe that adulterers should be stoned and that gays should be executed. They are in favor of the death penalty. As for those innocent death row inmates, they actually believe God will sort it all out in the next world. It is doubtful that any of these "Christians" would even recognize Jesus if he returned to earth, especially if he came back as a black, gay or an Iraqi.   America's Best Christian (with apologies to the devout Christian Betty Bowers), John Ashcroft, also presided over many executions while in office in Missouri. Who would Jesus electrocute? It would appear that his illegal campaign contributions amount to stealing.   His Justice Department says that torture stops just short of organ failure. What "stress positions" would Jesus advocate? Would he "water board" detainees until they thought they were about to drown? Would he specifically approve the use of dogs to intimidate prisoners as Rumsfeld did? Would he sexually humiliate them, leading them naked on a leash? Would he force them to masturbate and simulate sexual acts with one another as he video taped the proceedings? Ashcroft's god is not one most Christians would recognize from the Bible.   Bush has called our war in the Middle East a crusade. General Boykin, who believes God placed Bush in the White House, not the Supreme Court, says this his God is the real God, not the one worshipped by Muslims. His God helped him kill the infidels. Who would Jesus crusade against?   It certainly is remarkable that such an insipid, callow, little man like George W. Bush, who has slaughtered thousands of innocent civilians as surely as if he pulled the trigger himself, can be described as deeply religious by one of America's most mainstream magazines with no sense of irony. American lemmings are now so brain washed that they believe this war criminal is a man of God. It would seem that the God he worships is really the Viking god of war, Thor, with his thunder of ongoing, preemptive "Shock and Awe" extending as far as the eye can see into our future.   Heaven save us from these Christians.

						    In today's digest: FL Lawmaker Says 2000 Election 'Stolen' Four On Ethics Panel Accepted DeLay Money Election Troubles Already Descending Upon Florida   Fla. Lawmaker Says 2000 Election 'Stolen'    By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer   WASHINGTON - Think the passions from the 2000 presidential election have cooled? Certainly not in the House, which voted Thursday to strike a Florida representative's words from the record after she said Republicans "stole" that closely fought contest.   The verbal battle broke out after Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., proposed a measure barring any federal official from requesting that the United Nations (news - web sites) formally observe the U.S. elections on Nov. 2. His proposal was approved 243-161 as an amendment to a $19.4 billion foreign aid bill, with 33 Democrats joining all 210 voting Republicans in voting "yes."   Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Fla., and several other House Democrats have made that suggestion. They argue that some black voters were disenfranchised in 2000 and problems could occur again this fall.   "We welcome America to observe the integrity of our electoral process and we do not ask, though, for the United Nations to come as monitors at our polling stations," Buyer said.   "I come from Florida, where you and others participated in what I call the United States coup d'etat. We need to make sure it doesn't happen again," Brown said. "Over and over again after the election when you stole the election, you came back here and said, 'Get over it.' No, we're not going to get over it. And we want verification from the world."   At that point, Buyer demanded that Brown's words be "taken down," or removed the debate's permanent record.   The House's presiding officer, Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, ruled that Brown's words violated a House rule.   "Members should not accuse other members of committing a crime such as, quote, stealing, end quote, an election," Thornberry said.   When Brown objected to his ruling, the Republican-run House voted 219-187 along party lines to strike her words.   *********************   Four on Ethics Panel Accepted Delay Money   By SUZANNE GAMBOA, Associated Press Writer   WASHINGTON - Four of the five House ethics committee Republicans investigating Majority Leader Tom DeLay have accepted money in the past from the fund-raising operation involved in the complaint against him.   While leaders in both parties maintain organizations to raise money for candidates, the appearance of a conflict in DeLay's case is enough alone to warrant hiring an independent counsel of the type that investigated dethroned former speakers Jim Wright and Newt Gingrich, watchdog groups said Thursday.   "Mr. DeLay's stature as one of the most powerful members of Congress - with the capacity to extract retribution from anyone - makes it especially difficult for his peers to sit in judgment of him," said Common Cause president Chellie Pingree.   DeLay, who has denied the charges against him, said through a spokesman that an independent counsel is unnecessary. "We have full confidence the ethics committee will handle this in a proper manner," said aide Jonathan Grella.   The Texas Republican's political action committee, Americans for a Republican Majority, or ARMPAC, contributed $38,731 to four standing ethics committee members in the 1994 to 2004 election cycles, according the Center for Responsive Politics and PoliticalMoneyLine, groups that track political money.   Ethics committee members who got money include Doc Hastings of Washington, $5,930; Judy Biggert of Illinois, $1,764; Kenny Hulshof of Missouri, $14,964; and Steven LaTourette of Ohio, $16,073. Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo., the ethics panel's chairman, did not receive any contributions from ARMPAC during the period.   In 2001, DeLay used $75,000 from ARMPAC to establish another campaign cash chest, Texans for a Republican Majority (TRMPAC).   Rep. Chris Bell, D-Texas, filed a complaint last month charging that DeLay illegally solicited and accepted political contributions from Kansas-based Westar Corp. for TRMPAC in return for legislative favors.   Bell's complaint also alleges that DeLay abused his office by getting the Federal Aviation Administration (news - web sites) and FBI (news - web sites) agents to help track down Texas Democratic legislators when they left the state to prevent Republicans from passing a redistricting bill DeLay wanted. Bell was defeated in a March primary for re-election after he was redistricted.   Hefley expressed confidence that the Republicans on his committee who received money from DeLay's political committee would not be influenced by the contributions - a view echoed by two of the four GOP recipients.   "I know them well," Hefley said Thursday. "I don't have any question that they will do a fair and honorable job, without letting the contributions affect their judgment." But he also said he would support hiring an independent counsel if there was an "overwhelming reason."   The watchdog groups said the ethics cloud over DeLay's head can be removed only through an independent counsel.   His "political opponents would be deflated and accusations of partisanship on the part of the (ethics) committee would be meritless," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics.   Grella and another DeLay aide attended a news conference by the watchdog groups. They handed out lists of contributions by leaders of watchdog groups to Democrats, and contributions from Democratic leaders to Democrats on the ethics panel.   "It's worth noting that we're in the summer of the election year and this is the Democrats' strategy. They don't have any policy or accomplishments or agenda to speak of, so they are going to stick to politics of personal destruction," Grella said.   The ethics committee, officially known as the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, is reviewing Bell's complaint. It has to decide by early August whether to launch a formal investigation, dismiss the complaint or take more time reviewing it.   Last week, DeLay hired attorney Ed Bethune, a former Arkansas congressman who represented Gingrich in his ethics case. Bethune, a former FBI agent, prosecutor and lobbyist, previously represented DeLay in a fund-raising lawsuit filed by Democrats in 2000.  A Texas district attorney also is investigating whether Republicans funneled corporate contributions to Texas' 2002 House races through DeLay's TRMPAC. Texas law prohibits corporations from contributing to state legislative races. Prosecutors have said DeLay is not a target of that investigation.   *************************************   Election Troubles Already Descending on Florida  By ABBY GOODNOUGH  Published: July 15, 2004   IAMI, July 14 - Three years after Gov. Jeb Bush announced a new voting system that he called "a model for the rest of the nation," Florida is grappling with some of the same problems that threw the 2000 presidential election into chaos, as well as new ones that critics say could cause even more confusion this November.   The touch-screen voting machines intended to cure many of the ills of 2000 have raised a host of other concerns here just four months before the election. A new state rule excludes the machines from manual recounts, and the integrity of the machines was questioned after a problem was discovered in the audit process of some of them. Voting rights groups filed a lawsuit last week challenging the recount ban, and a Democratic congressman has also sued to request a printed record of every touch-screen vote.  The controversy over the new equipment is just one of Florida's challenges, which also include confirming which voters are ineligible, training poll workers on new policies and processing a flood of new registrations.   State officials announced on Saturday that they would throw out a controversial list used to remove felons from the voting rolls, acknowledging that Hispanic felons were absent from the list. Secretary of State Glenda E. Hood, appointed by Governor Bush last year, had earlier dismissed concerns from lawmakers and advocacy groups about the list of 48,000 suspected felons, which the state made public only after a judge's order.  The United States Civil Rights Commission, which issued a scathing report on the last election here in 2001, will examine problems with the list of felons in a hearing Thursday in Washington.  "The most important thing is to really show the voters that there are reasons to have confidence in these systems," said Bobbie Brinegar, president of the League of Women Voters of Miami-Dade County. "But the mantra has been 'trust us.' And that is not good enough."  Jacob DiPietre, a spokesman for Governor Bush, said the governor was "taking full responsibility" for the problem with the list, adding: "His No. 1 priority is to have a seamless election and an election where people have confidence that their vote will be counted."  The state, whose 36-day recount after the 2000 election stunned and divided the nation, is expected to be a major battleground again this year, with President Bush (the governor's brother) and Senator John Kerry, his probable Democratic opponent, fighting fiercely for its 27 electoral votes. Mr. Bush won Florida by 537 votes last time, but thousands of votes were discarded because of voter error on poorly designed ballots and other problems.   The Republican-led Legislature quickly passed an overhaul of the voting system in 2001, banning the punch-card ballots that caused so much trouble in 2000, giving counties money for new voting equipment and setting recount guidelines. It adopted two-thirds of the recommendations from a bipartisan task force that Governor Bush appointed after the 2000 election, but stayed away from some of the more contentious issues.  Most notably, lawmakers passed over recommendations to make the positions of county elections supervisors nonpartisan and to review the state's policy of permanently stripping felons of voting rights. The package that the Legislature adopted has played a role in the new turmoil. Tucked into the law was a provision keeping registration records secret. A state judge struck it down on July 2, opening the way for a close examination of the list of suspected felons to purge from the rolls.  Newspapers then reported that the list had a simple but glaring flaw: it guaranteed that no Hispanics, who tend to vote Republican here, would be purged, while thousands of blacks, who tend to vote Democratic, might be purged. Governor Bush moved quickly to drop it, but he was too late to avoid accusations from Democratic lawmakers and groups. The critics have denounced the effort to keep the list secret, the touch-screen problems and other troubles as purposeful efforts by Florida's Republican leadership to give President Bush an advantage here.  Unlike her predecessor Katherine Harris, who was co-chairwoman of President Bush's 2000 campaign in Florida even as she oversaw elections, Ms. Hood has publicly stayed away from politics. But critics say that Ms. Hood, a Republican and former Orlando mayor whom Governor Bush appointed, has sown doubt by dismissing criticism of the electoral system and by not answering questions sufficiently.  The abrupt resignation of Ed Kast, the state's director of elections, last month - he said he wanted to pursue other interests - only deepened public distrust, said Sandy Wayland, a member of the Miami-Dade Election Reform Coalition.  While previous secretaries of state were elected, Ms. Hood was the first appointed by the governor, the result of a 2003 change in the State Constitution. She reports to Governor Bush, who is therefore more directly responsible for her office's successes and failures.  "She is dealing with some really sophisticated, aggressive partisans," said Lance deHaven-Smith, a political science professor at Florida State University, speaking of the Jeb Bush administration. "She has been a good soldier, getting up and saying, 'Everything is fine, not to worry.' And come to find out, some of the problems that people feared were actually there. "  The coalition asked Ms. Hood's office last month to allow an independent review of the touch-screen machines now used by 15 of 67 counties, including Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach. The office said that only counties were authorized to seek such audits, and told reporters that the request was an effort to undermine voter confidence.   Through a public-records request, the coalition obtained e-mail messages and other documents from Miami-Dade election officials who referred to a flaw in the touch-screen equipment's ability to audit election results, a backup way of recording votes. The e-mail messages date back as far as June 2003.  Constance Kaplan, the Miami-Dade County elections supervisor, publicly acknowledged the problem this spring. This month, the company that makes the machines, Elections Systems and Software, provided software to correct the flaw, which the county and state say will not affect the machines' accuracy.  "It is important to note that the anomaly was rare, and all votes were counted as the anomaly did not affect the vote itself but rather the audit after," Ms. Hood's office wrote in a statement Tuesday.   Nicole de Lara, Ms. Hood's communications director, said that Ms. Kaplan's office had "unfortunately" not alerted Ms. Hood to the problem, and that she first learned of it from an article in The Daily Business Review in late May. Some critics suspect that Mr. Kast's resignation was related to the malfunction, but Mr. Kast said in aninterview it was not.   Ms. Wayland is among many here who contend that counties like Miami-Dade and Broward adopted touch-screen technology too soon, swayed by aggressive lobbyists. The 52 counties that do not use touch-screen equipment use optical-scan machines, which produce records that can be manually recounted.   A recent analysis by The Sun-Sentinel found that touch-screen machines in South Florida failed to record votes eight times more often than optical-scan machines in the March presidential primary.  Nonetheless, Ms. de Lara said touch-screen machines were wholly reliable for tabulating votes. She added that they would never require a recount because under state law the only reason for a manual recount is "voter intent" when a voter makes too many or too few choices. Touch-screen machines do not allow people to vote for more than one candidate, she said. And if people do not choose any candidate for a given office, that is their prerogative, she said.  The rule says no manual recounts will be conducted when votes are cast by touch-screen machine.  The election reform coalition and other groups have also expressed concerns about a new policy on provisional ballots, used by Floridians if poll workers cannot verify their registration on the spot. The Legislature decided that provisional ballots cast outside a voter's home precinct can be thrown out, which voting-rights groups call unfair.   Florida is one of several states where people are questioning touch-screen technology. California's secretary of state, Kevin Shelley, has prohibited the use of machines from Diebold Election Systems in four counties for the November election, and has ordered that touch-screen systems bought after July 1, 2005, produce a paper record that is verifiable by the voter.  "There's no question in my mind that ultimately there will be paper trails in every county in Florida," said Representative Robert Wexler, a Florida Democrat whose suits challenging paperless voting systems are on appeal. "The only question is when."   Ford Fessenden contributed reporting from New York for this article.

						    This week, our campaign for Voter Verified Paper Ballots is kicking into high gear.  Rallies were held yesterday in 19 states, calling on state election officials to require paper ballots.  More than 120,000 of our petition signatures were delivered to these officials.   Congress now has two weeks left before its summer recess to act on two key federal bills that would require paper ballots: a Senate bill sponsored by a Republican, Sen. John Ensign, and a House bill sponsored by a Democrat, Rep. Rush Holt.  Both need our immediate support.  Please call your Senators and Representative:    Senator Bob Graham   Washington, DC: 202-224-3041    Senator Bill Nelson   Washington, DC: 202-224-5274    Congressman Tom Feeney   Washington, DC: 202-225-2706  Urge your Senators to:    "Please co-sponsor Senator Ensign's 'Voting Integrity and Verification Act,' # S 2437."      Urge your Representative to:    "Please co-sponsor Rep. Holt's 'Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act,' # HR 2239."  Please let us know you're calling, at:  http://www.moveon.org/callmade7.html?id=3092-4210388-mbBXrtv9OYlOe9rdSTqplg  The evidence is overwhelming: electronic voting terminals are susceptible to manipulation before and after voting.  If they malfunction, votes may be lost irretrievably.  That's why we should be able to verify our votes on secure paper ballots that can be counted and re-counted.  The Senate and House bills above would require that all electronic voting systems provide a Voter-Verified Paper Ballot, and would make the paper ballot the official ballot of record.  Ensign's Senate bill would do this by 2006 and Holt's House bill would do it by 2004.  Even a 2006 deadline should be enough to show state election officials that they shouldn't buy electronic voting terminals this year or next unless they produce Voter-Verified Paper Ballots.  We deserve the most reliable and trustworthy voting systems available anywhere. Please make these calls today.

						     Dear MoveOn Member,     Yesterday, President Bush's effort to write divisiveness and hate into the Constitution went down in flames. Republicans needed 67 votes in the Senate to pass the Federal Marriage Amendment, but they got only 48 on yesterday’s vote – not even a simple majority. It's a huge victory.     Despite the defeat in Congress, Republicans threaten now to make this "an election year issue." Our response: Bring it on. Today, we're highlighting four great Democratic candidates who are running against some of the staunchest supporters of writing discrimination into the Constitution. If we all chip in a little to their campaigns, we can demonstrate that when you try to deny people their civil rights, you don't just lose a vote in Congress – you lose your seat.     You can make a secure, easy online contribution to these campaigns right now at:   urlLink  http://www.moveonpac.org/give/04endorsed.html        &nbsp;   While all four of our new featured candidates oppose the Marriage Amendment, they're also each good progressives on other issues as well. Each of these individuals has a compelling personal story and a record of leadership that inspired MoveOn members to nominate them. We believe it will also inspire their constituents to elect them this November.     Each of these candidates also has the opportunity to knock off a conservative right-wing politician, moving us closer to control of the U.S. House.     Our first candidate is Jim Stork, an openly gay man locked in a one of the most competitive races in the country. Jim is running against conservative Republican Clay Shaw in Florida's 22nd District, a Democratic leaning seat that Gore won in 2000 by 5% and John Kerry is currently leading in by the double digits. Stork, the former mayor of Wilton Gardens and a highly successful small business owner, is running an aggressive and intelligent campaign in the center of Presidential battleground politics – Broward County, Florida. His election to Congress would make him only the fourth openly gay member serving in the U.S. House.   Gloria, a MoveOn member from Miami says of Jim, "Jim Stork is a man who is well-respected and is interested in restoring rights for all of us – rights that are being removed by the Patriot Act and rights that are being denied to people due to sexual orientation. He is a man of honor and that is much needed in the US Congress."     Next up is Kalyn Free, running for the 2nd district in Oklahoma. Kalyn became the youngest prosecutor ever hired at the U.S. Department of Justice at the age of 23 and then spent 10 years prosecuting environmental polluters. An intelligent advocate who has worked hard her entire life, Kalyn is a native Oklahoman and member of the Choctaw nation. If elected Free would become the first Native American woman to be elected to Congress. She's in a tight primary race against a very conservative Democrat who supports the Marriage Amendment, supports the war in Iraq, and has received significant backing from the oil and gas industry and the NRA. By supporting Kalyn, we can demonstrate not just to Republicans but to conservative Democrats as well that writing hate into the Constitution just won't fly.   Brian from McAlester, Oklahoma nominated Free and wrote: "Kalyn helped me when I was down and in trouble. With her help and support I made it. I just finished 3 years in the Navy and am happily married and working back in Oklahoma. Kalyn cares from the heart. She is knowledgeable about issues that are important to labor groups, veterans, children and all Oklahomans. She is the one we need in Congress."     In New Mexico's 1st Congressional District, we're highlighting Richard Romero, an outstanding New Mexico State Senate President Pro Tem as well as former teacher. Romero is taking on incumbent Congresswoman Heather Wilson. Wilson is a right-wing Republican who has rubber-stamped nearly every piece of legislation Bush Administration legislation she has seen. Romero is pro-choice and opposed to the constitutional ban on gay marriage. He is running a strong race in this swing state, where voters are responding to his positive message. The race is already neck and neck. With our support, Richard Romero can win.   Of Romero's politics at home, Kathryn from Santa Fe, New Mexico said, "While in the State Senate he took on the old powers and started a reform movement. He was successful and became a symbol of progressive politics for the state. His warm personality, brilliance and knowledge of the First District are exceeded only by his commitment to progressive politics."     Last, we are endorsing Jon Jennings, an Indiana Democrat with a strong chance of beating one of the most conservative members of the U.S. House in Indiana's 8th Congressional District. His opponent, John Hostettler, recently gained notoriety for trying to carry a loaded firearm onto an airplane. Hostettler said he would vote against the Federal Marriage Amendment because it does not go far enough and instead introduced the Marriage Protection Act (HR 3313) which removes the power of the courts to determine the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act.     Jennings, the son of an Alcoa steel worker who worked the 3rd shift to support his family, began his career as an assistant coach and scout for the Boston Celtics. Jon was the first person in his family to graduate from high school and go to college. Jon left sports with a calling to public service and was selected for the prestigious White House Fellow's program by the Clinton Administration and later became the Principal Deputy U.S. Attorney General for Legislative Affairs for Janet Reno in 1999. Jon is running a strong campaign in Indiana and attracting national attention for his important race.   Vicki from Terre Haute, Indiana said: "Jon Jennings is a bona fide Democrat who opposes the antics of the Bush administration and its minions. Jennings has shown an ability to organize and fundraise and has a real chance to take this seat for the Democrats."     Together, our thousands of small contributions can make a big difference in each of these races. And when these candidates win in November, it will demonstrate for years to come that politicians lose when they support discrimination. Please consider making a gift of $10, $25, $50, or more if you can today, to each of these four candidates.   Just go to:&nbsp;   urlLink  http://www.moveonpac.org/give/04endorsed.html        Thank you,  --Eli Pariser and Hannah Pingree  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MoveOn PAC  &nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday, July 15th, 2004

						    July 12, 2004 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ and ANDREA ELLIOTT   A group of antiwar advocates is accusing Clear Channel Communications, one of the nation's largest media companies, with close ties to national Republicans, of preventing the group from displaying a Times Square billboard critical of the war in Iraq.   The billboard - an image of a red, white and blue bomb with the words "Democracy Is Best Taught by Example, Not by War" - was supposed to go up next month, the antiwar group said, and it was to be in place when Republicans from across the country gathered in New York City to nominate President Bush for a second term.   But members of the group, Project Billboard, contend that Clear Channel backed out of a leasing agreement last month that the two had reached in December for the billboard site, on the Marriott Marquis Hotel at Broadway and 45th Street.   A Project Billboard spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said the group planned to file a lawsuit today in federal court in Manhattan charging Clear Channel with breach of contract and asking it to live up to what the group said were the terms of the deal.   Last night, the president and chief executive of Clear Channel, Paul Meyer, said the company had objected to the group's use of "the bomb imagery" in the proposed billboard. Mr. Meyer said Clear Channel had accepted a billboard that would replace the bomb with a dove. However, he said, any billboard at the site required the approval of the Marriott Marquis management, which he said also objected to the bomb.   "We have no political agenda," Mr. Meyer said. "It's the bomb imagery we objected to."   A spokeswoman for the hotel, Kathleen Duffy, said that the management considered the ad with the bomb "inappropriate," but that it had not seen the version with the dove.   Told of Mr. Meyer's comments, Mr. Wolfson said that earlier, Clear Channel had rejected the ad with the dove as well as the one with the bomb, demanding that the words be changed, too. "It's news to us, and not reflected in any prior communications between Clear Channel and Project Billboard," Mr. Wolfson said last night. "This contradicts Clear Channel's demand that the copy be changed."   The dispute had led members of the antiwar group to accuse Clear Channel of censorship.   "I think the idea that political advertising is banned from some part of New York City would be repellent to New Yorkers," Mr. Wolfson said. "I guess we can have a war, but we can't talk about it."   This is not the first time that Clear Channel, one of the nation's largest owners of radio stations, has found itself in the middle of a debate over free speech and censorship.   The company has been accused of using its radio stations to rally support for the war in Iraq, while trying to silence musicians who oppose it.   The company's critics point out, for instance, that some Clear Channel country music stations stopped playing the songs of the Dixie Chicks last year after the group's lead singer, Natalie Maines, told fans during a London concert, "We're ashamed the president of the United States is from Texas."   The company's critics also point out that the Federal Communications Commission is considering regulations that would make it easier for companies like Clear Channel to own more television and radio stations.   But even some of its fiercest critics agree that some claims against Clear Channel are overstated. As it turns out, for example, its stations were only sporadically involved in a boycott against the Dixie Chicks.   Part of what may be fueling speculation about the company's motives is the close relationship that its executives have with the Republican Party and the Bush  administration. In the 2000 and 2002 election cycles, for instance, the company and its officials donated slightly more than $300,000 in unregulated money, almost all of it to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, an organization in Washington that monitors political contributions.   In addition, Tom Hicks, the Texas Rangers' owner who has longtime ties to President Bush, is a top executive at Clear Channel.   Project Billboard's representatives said the contract they signed in December with Spectacolor, a division of Clear Channel, required the antiwar group to pay $368,000 to use the billboard space from Aug. 2 through Nov. 2, Election Day.   But they said Spectacolor began balking after company officials saw the ad that included the image of the bomb.  The group then sent a second ad, which replaced the bomb with a red, white and blue dove accompanied by the same words, but Mr. Wolfson said that was also rejected.   A lawyer for Project Billboard, Doug Curtis, said that at one point Clear Channel suggested that the group use a less provocative billboard ad, one with the image of a little girl waving a flag accompanied by the words, "Democracy is best taught by example."   Mr. Curtis said that earlier this month, a vice president for marketing for Spectacolor and Clear Channel, Barry Kula, sent the group an e-mail message that said, in part, "We hope you will appreciate that New York City has endured a horrific attack and businesses in this area that serve a wide array of clientele are extremely sensitive to references to war."   Project Billboard's director, Deborah Rappaport, indicated that the reaction of Clear Channel executives was not a complete surprise given what she described as its poor record on free expression. "This is not the first time," she said. "They try to suppress speech with which they don't agree."   The dispute between Clear Channel and the antiwar group drew a mixed reaction yesterday from visitors in Times Square.   When shown a printed copy of the antiwar ads that Clear Channel is said to have rejected, Nene Ofuatey-Kodjoe, 36, of Stamford, Conn., became visibly upset. "Clear Channel should not have a position one way or another about what they put up there as long as it's not obscene," he said.   He also scoffed at the alternative billboard proposed by Clear Channel, with a little girl waving the flag. "All the fence-sitting is what has gotten us to where we are today," he said. "You have got to take a stand."   Terry and Jim Baugh, two Californians strolling north on Seventh Avenue, said the image of the bomb bordered on treason. "That looks like they're trying to blow up America," said Mrs. Baugh, 59, a retired dental hygienist.

						    JG has sent me a snotload of articles, and I'm going to include them in a digest, all in one entry right here....I may get more from him later this evening.    IN THIS DIGEST:   Officials Want Election Rescheduling Rules Red Cross Fears That US Is Hiding Detainees Bush Seeks Shift In Logging Rules More Voters See Bush As Arrogant   Officials Want Election Rescheduling Rules    By ERICA WERNER, Associated Press Writer   WASHINGTON - The head of a new federal voting commission suggested to congressional leaders Monday that there should be a process for canceling or rescheduling an election interrupted by terrorism, but national security adviser Condoleezza Rice said no such plan is being considered by the administration.   Federal officials warned last week that intelligence indicates al-Qaida wants to attack the United States to disrupt the upcoming elections.   "There does not appear to be a clear process in place to suspend or reschedule voting during an election if there is a major terrorist attack," DeForest B. Soaries, chairman of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, wrote in a letter to Republican and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the one-page letter.   Rice said the Bush administration, while concerned about the impact of terrorism, is not thinking of postponing the elections.   "We've had elections in this country when we were at war, even when we were in civil war. And we should have the elections on time. That's the view of the president, that's the view of the administration," Rice told CNN on Monday.   Soaries also sent lawmakers copies of an earlier letter he wrote to Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge. In that letter, dated June 25, Soaries noted that Sept. 11, 2001, fell on Election Day in New York and state officials delayed voting until later that month. He wrote that no federal agency has the statutory authority to cancel or reschedule a federal election.   Soaries also expressed concern in the earlier letter that increased Election Day security could intimidate some voters, highlighting the need for communication between security officials and election administrators. He raised that issue again in his letter to lawmakers.   Soaries said Monday he was scheduled to meet early next week with Homeland Security officials to discuss the issues.   The Help America Vote Act of 2002 created the Election Assistance Commission.  *****************   JG's comment: Of course, stuff like this is rarely reported, and most people think "So what, it's just a bunch of terrorists, this makes us safer" and don't think about the fact that tomorrow THEY could be the ones who disappear.    Red Cross Fears U.S. Is Hiding Detainees   By NAOMI KOPPEL, Associated Press Writer   GENEVA - The international Red Cross said Tuesday that it fears U.S. officials are holding terror suspects secretly in locations across the world.   The Geneva Conventions on the conduct of warfare require the United States to give the Red Cross access to prisoners of war and other detainees.   "We have access to people detained by the United States in Guantanamo Bay, Afghanistan and Iraq, but in our understanding there are people that are detained outside these places for which we haven't received notification or access," said Antonella Notari, a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross.   The United States says it is cooperating with the organization and has allowed Red Cross delegates access to thousands of prisoners, including former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.   But Notari told The Associated Press that some suspects reported as arrested by the FBI on its Web site, or identified in media reports, are unaccounted for.   "Some of these people who have been reported to be arrested never showed up in any of the places of detention run by the U.S. where we visit," Notari said.   She said she had read media reports that some people are being held at Diego Garcia, a British-held island in the Indian Ocean used as a strategic military base by the United States, but the ICRC has not been notified of any prisoners there.   "We just simply have absolutely no confirmation of this in any formal way," she said.   The U.S. government has not officially responded to a Red Cross demand for notification of all detainees, including those held in undisclosed locations, she said.   That request was made by ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger in January during a visit to Washington that featured meetings with Secretary of State Colin Powell, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice.   "So far we haven't had a satisfactory reply," Notari said.   An Army report on the abuses at Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison found that military police there "routinely held persons brought to them by Other Government Agencies without accounting for them, knowing their identities, or even the reason for their detention."   On at least one occasion they moved these "ghost detainees" around the prison to hide them from a visiting Red Cross delegation, the report by Maj. Gen. Antonio Taguba said. He described the actions as "deceptive, contrary to Army Doctrine, and in violation of international law."   In an interview in Tuesday's edition of the German business daily Handelsblatt, Kellenberger defended the Red Cross policy of refusing to comment publicly on the conditions that it finds in places of detention, preferring to negotiate directly with the authorities.   The international Red Cross came under criticism for not speaking out about the abuse at Abu Ghraib until it was revealed in the media.   "Certain people had the impression that our repeated, confidential approaches to the U.S. authorities were falling flat," Kellenberger said.   "But impressions can be wrong. When we visited Abu Ghraib in January 2004, we found improvements compared with October 2003, and when we visited in March it was better than in January."   The ICRC has, however, spoken out on its concerns over the continued detention without trial of prisoners at Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba.   "I made it clear in January that we were not happy with the improvements," Kellenberger said.   ******************   JG's comment: I guess he's trying to strip as much environmental protection & business regulation as he can now, in case he loses.    Bush Seeks Shift in Logging Rules  By FELICITY BARRINGER  Published: July 13, 2004   WASHINGTON, July 12 - The Bush administration on Monday proposed scuttling a rule from the Clinton administration that put nearly 60 million acres of national forest largely off limits to logging, mining or other development in favor of a new system that would leave it to governors to seek greater - or fewer - strictures on road construction in forests.  The announcement abandoning the so-called roadless rule was made by Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman in Boise, Idaho, where opposition to the rule issued by President Bill Clinton as he was leaving office was most pronounced.  Ms. Veneman described the proposal as a way to sidestep the tangle of litigation over building roads through national forests and to improve local participation and federal flexibility in determining the use of national forests.  "State governments are important partners in the stewardship of the nation's lands and natural resources," she said.  A spectrum of environmental groups reacted with disappointment and outrage to the announcement.   "This doesn't ensure that a single acre of roadless area gets protected," said Marty Hayden, legislative director for Earthjustice, one of several groups that are defending the Clinton rule in federal court.  "Everything could be up for grabs," Mr. Hayden said.  Ms. Veneman's announcement was a signature moment for the Bush administration's environmental policy. After three years of gradually retreating from Mr. Clinton's sweeping preservationist rule, which covered about 30 percent of the 191 million acres of national forest and was embraced by environmentalists, the administration is decisively rejecting it and substituting a process that makes state officials the moving force in deciding whether to log or to conserve forest lands.  The administration had offered at best a perfunctory defense of the rule when it was challenged by the State of Idaho, but the preliminary injunction by a federal district judge there striking down the rule was later overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. Last summer, another federal judge, in Wyoming, struck down the roadless rule; Earthjustice and other groups are appealing that ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver.  James L. Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said in an interview: "The context for this was: ad hoc doesn't get us to where we want to be; one-size-fits-all was creating some real issues at the margins. Can we construct a process that will be respectful of local needs and still let us put an important focus on conservation of roadless areas? That's what this is about."   Under the proposal, Mr. Connaughton said, a governor could petition the Forest Service to expand existing roadless protections, keep them the same, or contract them. For each state, he added, "it will put in place a more strategic vision of how roadless conservation will be handled."  The announcement Monday also reflected the administration's willingness to break with allies in the conservation field. Jim Range, a former senior Republican Congressional staff member who in 2001 helped establish the Forest Road Working Group to advise the administration on the issue, issued a statement saying that the loss of the protections was a disappointment.   "The current regulation established an important degree of certain protection to these valuable areas, which provide important fish and wildlife habitat and recreational opportunities for American hunters, anglers, campers, hikers and others," Mr. Range, who is also chairman of the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, said.   "The new process by which state governors can submit new roadless area protection plans will perpetuate the uncertainty associated with this issue,'' he said, "and may lead to a substantial reduction in the level of protection that roadless areas are afforded."  The proposal, which will be open to public comment for the next 60 days, includes a provision for an 18-month period in which governors can prepare their requests. During that time, changes to a roadless designation could be made with the approval of the Forest Service chief, Dale Bosworth.   After that, the governors could seek changes in designations in individual forest management plans that predated the Clinton rule. At the time the rule was proposed, about 58.5 million acres of national forest was roadless, but roads were contemplated on more than 34 million.  The national division over the issue of roads and timber harvests was visible in Congress last month. In a close vote, the House approved a measure prohibiting the use of federal money for new logging roads in the Tongass National Forest.  The Tongass, a West Virginia-size swath of rock and timber in southeastern Alaska, had been exempted from the Clinton rule's protections by an earlier decision. Last week, the Forest Service announced the approval or likely approval of two timber projects in the forest, which are likely to require more than 25 miles of new roads.  The 12 states most affected by the roadless issue, which contain 97 percent of all roadless areas in the country, are Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.   Gov. Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho, a Republican, appeared with Ms. Veneman at Monday's news conference and said of roadless protections: "There's a right way and a wrong way to make that determination. Today the federal government and the Bush administration is doing it the right way. We now have a roadless process that can be accomplished by respecting state sovereignty."   Montana's governor, Judy Martz, a Republican, said in a statement, "The president has again proven that he and his administration understand that state, tribal, and local governments are best equipped to make key decisions about the future of our public lands."  But in a conference call with reporters, New Mexico's governor, Bill Richardson, a Democrat and energy secretary under Mr. Clinton, said, "These are areas that the federal government should manage consistently from state to state."  Mr. Richardson called the current proposal " bad policy, bad environmental policy, bad Western policy." The Bush administration, he said, "wants to drill, drill, build, build."   Allison Dobson, a press officer for John Kerry's Democratic presidential campaign, said in a statement: "This battle has been hard-fought. A clear majority of Americans support the roadless rule, and it's unfortunate that George Bush has chosen to ignore the needs of not only the wildlife, but the many Americans who enjoy recreation in these areas."  Mr. Connaughton, in his interview, said, "They are national lands for a public purpose."  Most of the people who use the lands, he added, "are state citizens." Each governor, he said, is free to apply for the full protections afforded by the Clinton rule.  Asked if in a decade, under this proposal, there would be more or fewer roadless areas, he said, "Couldn't say. Couldn't say."  ******************************   JG's comment: AOL had this story posted too, but they changed the headline from "Arrogant" to "Decisive"    AP Poll: More Voters See Bush As Arrogant   By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer   WASHINGTON - President Bush is viewed by more American voters as decisive and arrogant than Democratic rival John Kerry, according to an Associated Press poll. Voters are more likely to see Kerry as intelligent.  Asked who makes them feel more optimistic about the future, slightly more voters choose Bush than Kerry, the poll conducted for the AP by Ipsos-Public Affairs found. Both candidates are viewed as wealthy by nearly all voters, with slightly more seeing Bush as wealthy than Kerry. Two-thirds in the poll think the president is decisive, the biggest character advantage the president has over Kerry in the poll. But a majority, 52 percent, also say they think Bush is arrogant. "The quality I like about the president is he knows what he wants, and he focuses on what he wants to do. He's not wishy-washy," said Sam Werzberger, a 26-year-old independent from New York City, who hasn't decided for whom he will vote. "I've seen very little of Kerry, but he seems to say what people want to hear."   The poll asked voters whether they would or would not use each of seven words - likable, intelligent, decisive, compassionate, honest, arrogant and wealthy - to describe Bush and then Kerry. Kerry and Bush are evenly matched on qualities like compassion, honesty and likability. But Bush has a 22-point edge over Kerry on the question of who is decisive. Two-thirds said Bush is decisive and fewer than half said that of Kerry. Only two-thirds of Democrats said Kerry is decisive.   As Kerry prepares to introduce himself to the public at the Democratic National Convention in two weeks, one of his biggest obstacles is convincing voters he can provide the kind of firm leadership needed in a time of war and terrorism. Bush's confidence and unwillingness to change his stand despite opposition are viewed negatively by some. A majority, 52 percent, said he's arrogant, more than the 44 percent who view Kerry that way. "I think they both kind of come off as arrogant," said Becky Robertson, a 31-year-old independent from Radcliffe, Ky. "That's a typical political thing."   The Bush re-election team spent more than $80 million during the spring trying to portray Kerry as a flip-flopper and a tax raiser. While the president has been unable to gain a lead in the race against Kerry, his campaign succeeded in raising doubts about Kerry's willingness to take a stand.   Kerry played a role in that perception after voting to authorize the war in Iraq, then struggling to explain his views on war when it was clear many Democratic voters in the primaries were opposed.   Four in five voters, 83 percent, say Kerry is intelligent, compared with 63 percent who view Bush as intelligent. "I haven't heard much about Kerry, but he seems like a pretty sensible fellow," said Judy Bryson, a 56-year-old independent from Dalton, Ga. "I really like the man he's chosen to run with him as vice president."   Nine in 10 voters view the president as wealthy while nearly as many, 85 percent, see Kerry as wealthy. Both men are multimillionaires, but Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, inherited more than $500 million from her late husband, Republican Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania.   Within the last week, Kerry's campaign has been energized by the selection of John Edwards, a senator from North Carolina, to be his running mate. They projected a sunny, optimistic message as they barnstormed through swing states last week. But when voters were asked which of the candidates makes them feel more optimistic about America, Bush had an edge. Half, 50 percent, chose Bush and 44 percent chose Kerry. "Since 9/11, there has been no major terrorist attack on this country," said Bob Shea, a 52-year-old independent-leaning Democrat from Westfield, Mass. "So I have to say Bush and his administration have done a reasonable job."  The AP-Ipsos poll of 804 registered voters was taken July 5-7 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

						    I thought I should present a couple of questions posed by CD:   1.  Why are ALL military members REQUIRED to leave their records in the tender loving care of the Gov't, regardless of the fact these records are absolutely VITAL to their future and the Gov't has a piss-poor record of safe keping?   2. Given the above, why for the last 30 years (as I've been somewhat keeping track  does the Gov't have a 100% SUCCESS rate locating records when the only person to suffer is some average Citizen Schmuck or someone the republiFacists don't like, and has a 100% FAILURE rate in cases like that of Traitorshrub?   Anyone ever considered this before???

						     Lynne, Dick Cheney Differ on Gay Marriage  By WILL LESTER, AP      WASHINGTON (July 11) - Lynne Cheney, the vice president's wife and mother of a lesbian, said Sunday that states should have the final say over the legal status of personal relationships.  That stand puts her at odds with the vice president on the need for the constitutional amendment now under debate in the Senate that effectively would ban gay marriage.  "I think that the constitutional amendment discussion will give us an opportunity to look for ways to discuss ways in which we can keep the authority of the states intact,'' Cheney told CNN's "Late Edition.''  The Senate began debate Friday on an amendment that defines marriage as a union of a man and woman as husband and wife.  Supporters acknowledge the proposal is endorsed by only about half the Senate, well short of the two-thirds needed to approve a change in the Constitution. Still, a vote would put lawmakers on the spot in an election year as they seek to balance backing traditional marriage and gay rights.  Cheney has two daughters, both of whom are working in his campaign. The Cheney's gay daughter, Mary, is director of vice presidential operations for the Bush-Cheney re-election campaign. She held a public role as her father's assistant in the 2000 campaign and helped the GOP recruit gay voters during the 2002 midterm elections.  She has been less visible this year while traveling with the vice president or working at campaign headquarters in Arlington, Va. As the election nears, she will play a more public role, campaign aides say.  President Bush said in his weekly radio address Saturday that legalizing gay marriage would redefine the most fundamental institution of civilization. A constitutional amendment is needed to protect marriage, he said.  During the 2000 campaign, vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney took the position states should decide legal issues about personal relationships and that people should be free to enter relationships of their choosing.  When Massachusetts' high court ruled last year that gay couples are entitled to wed, the issue became a very hot political topic. Republicans hope it will take votes away from the Democratic presidential ticket.  Both Bush and Cheney have voiced their support this year for the proposed constitutional amendment. Their Democratic rivals, Sens. John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina, oppose the amendment.     The Democrats also oppose gay marriage, but defend a gay couple's rights to the same legal protections as those conferred in marriage.  Asked Sunday about her husband's stand on gay marriage in 2004, Lynne Cheney said, "I thought that the formulation he used in 2000 was very good.  "First of all, to be clear that people should be free to enter into their relationships that they choose. And, secondly, to recognize what's historically been the situation, that when it comes to conferring legal status on relationships, that is a matter left to the states,'' she said.  Lynne Cheney said the situation in 2004 is somewhat different from the one four years ago because of the Massachusetts court ruling and its effect on states.  Asked again about the difference between the Democrats and the Bush administration on the amendment, Cheney reaffirmed her preference for local solutions.  The vice president's press office had no immediate comment Sunday.    Flaws Reportedly Found in Florida Touchscreen Voting   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (July 11) - Touchscreen voting machines didn't perform as well as devices that scanned paper ballots in this year's Florida Democratic presidential primary, raising questions about the state's voting process for the November election, a newspaper reported Sunday.  Gertrude Epstein tries out a touch screen voting machine made by Sequoia Voting Systems during a 2001 demonstration in Delray Beach, Florida.       An analysis of just under half of the ballots from the March 9 election shows that votes were not recorded for about one out of every 100 people using the new machines, or a 1.09 percent rate of undervotes, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported. An undervote is when a selection cannot be detected on a ballot.  That's at least eight times the number of undervotes in the same election on paper ballots marked with pencils and tallied by an optical scanner, which had a 0.12 percent rate of undervotes, the newspaper reported.  Undervotes were a problem in the contested 2000 presidential election, in which many Floridians cast their ballots on punch-card machines. After 36 days of legal wrangling and recounts, George W. Bush won Florida, and thus the White House, by just 537 votes.  According to a review sponsored by The Associated Press and other news organizations, about 61,190 of 6.1 million total ballots in that election were undervotes, or a 1 percent rate.  The state outlawed the punch-card machines after the 2000 election, and the touchscreen machines were billed as a way to avoid a repeat of the problems. Fifteen Florida counties now use touchscreen machines.  A spokeswoman for Secretary of State Glenda Hood, Florida's top elections official, did not return calls seeking comment Sunday.  The Sun-Sentinel analysis of the March 9 election reviewed nearly 350,000 ballots statewide, or about 44 percent of all ballots cast. The ballots analyzed had only one choice, selection of a Democratic Party presidential nominee.  The analysis found optical scan machines counted 12 overvotes in the March sample, where voters chose more than one candidate. Overvotes are impossible to cast on touchscreen machines. The media-sponsored review of the 2000 election found 113,820 overvotes, a 1.9 percent rate.  The newspaper's findings did not surprise officials of Sequoia Voting Systems and Elections Systems & Software, two companies manufacturing touchscreen machines sold in Florida.     ''The most important thing to take from the (Sun-Sentinel) survey findings is that both electronic systems and precinct-based optical scan systems dramatically reduce voter error. ... The Florida numbers demonstrate a substantive improvement over the 2000 presidential election,'' said Alfie Charles, vice president of business development for Sequoia.  Meghan McCormick, spokeswoman for ES&S, said some voters simply choose to cast blank ballots.  Theresa LePore, Palm Beach County elections supervisor, said it is almost impossible to eliminate undervotes because some people will choose not to vote for any candidate or will make mistakes.  ''There is only one perfect voting system,'' LePore said. ''That's the one that doesn't involve humans.''    Critics Sue Electronic Voting Company   Diebold Targeted Under Whistleblower Law  By RACHEL KONRAD, AP   SAN FRANCISCO (July 11) - Critics of electronic voting are suing Diebold Inc. under a whistleblower law, alleging that the company's shoddy balloting equipment exposed California elections to hackers and software bugs.  California's attorney general unsealed the lawsuit Friday. It was filed in November but sealed under a provision that keeps such actions secret until the government decides whether to join the plaintiffs.  Lawmakers from Maryland to California are expressing doubts about the integrity of paperless voting terminals made by several large manufacturers, which up to 50 million Americans will use in November.  The California lawsuit was filed in state court by computer programmer Jim March and activist Bev Harris, who are seeking full reimbursement for Diebold equipment purchased in California.  Issues cited by the case include Diebold's use of uncertified hardware and software, and modems that may have allowed election results to be published online before polls closed.  They are asking California to join the lawsuit against Diebold. The state has not yet made a decision.  State election officials have spent at least $8 million on paperless touchscreen machines. Alameda County, for one, has spent at least $11 million.  Under the whistleblower statute, March and Harris could collect up to 30 percent of any reimbursement.  ''This is about money now - a case of the capitalist system at work,'' said March, of Sacramento. ''The laws on voting products and processes are unfortunately unclear. But the law on defrauding the government is really, really clear. Going after the money trail is cleaner than going after proper procedures.''      Diebold spokesman David Bear said Saturday the company has not been served with the lawsuit and would not comment until it reviewed the case.  Election officials have until Sept. 7 to decide whether to join the lawsuit, said Tom Dresslar, spokesman for state Attorney General Bill Lockyer.  Alameda County also has not yet decided whether to participate, said Elaine Ginnold of the county's registrar of voters office. She said Diebold has been ''extremely responsive'' in addressing problems with its system used in the March primary, which forced at least 6,000 of 316,000 voters to use backup paper ballots.  ''I think we avoided a major crisis - it would have been much, much worse had we not had those paper ballot backups,'' Ginnold said.  Earlier this year, California Secretary of State Kevin Shelley banned one Diebold voting system unless counties met a host of conditions, including precautions to prevent tampering and giving paper ballots to voters who prefer them.  In the March primary, 573 of 1,038 polling places in San Diego County failed to open on time because of computer malfunctions. A software bug in North Carolina's 2002 general election deleted 436 electronic ballots from six paperless machines in two counties.  Some people are critical of the use of the whistleblower statute with its reward system for plaintiffs.  ''I would like to see people support a real solution rather than just try to cash in,'' said Alan Dechert, founder of Open Voting Consortium Inc., whose voting system relies on nonproprietary software. ''There are a lot of people who could be a tremendous asset, but they're grandstanding and reveling in the expose.''    (on story below) How much do you want to bet those "provisional ballots" will only be approved if they're for the "right" choice? - JG    Florida Scraps Flawed Felon Voting List    MIAMI (July 11) - Florida elections officials said Saturday they will not use a disputed list that was designed to keep felons from voting, acknowledging a flaw that could have allowed convicted Hispanic felons to cast ballots in November.  The glitch in a state that President Bush won by just 537 votes could have been significant - because of the state's sizable Cuban population, Hispanics in Florida have tended to vote Republican more than Hispanics nationally. The list had about 28,000 Democrats and around 9,500 Republicans, with most of the rest unaffiliated.  "Not including Hispanic felons that may be voters on the list ... was an oversight and a mistake,'' Gov. Jeb Bush said. "And we accept responsibility and that's why we're pulling it back.''  Gov. Bush said the mistake occurred because two databases that were merged to form the disputed list were incompatible.  The problem in compiling the list was unintentional and unforeseen, said Nicole de Lara, a spokeswoman for Secretary of State Glenda Hood.  "Nevertheless, Supervisors of Elections are required to uphold their constitutional obligation'' and will find other ways to ensure felons are removed from the rolls, Hood said in a statement.  Florida is one of only a handful of states that does not automatically restore voting rights to convicted felons once they've completed their sentence.  The decision to scrap the list was made after it was reported that the list contained few people identified as Hispanic; of the nearly 48,000 people on the list created by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, only 61 were classified as Hispanics.  That was because when voters register in Florida, they can identify themselves as Hispanic. But the potential felons database has no Hispanic category, which excludes many people from the list if they put that as their race.  The law enforcement list was compared to the voter rolls to determine who should be barred from voting.  The glitch, first reported by the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, affected only those who identified themselves as Hispanic. A review of the voter list by The Associated Press found others with Hispanic surnames who did not identify themselves as Hispanic.  The purge of felons from voter rolls has been a thorny issue since the 2000 presidential election. A private company hired to identify ineligible voters before the election produced a list with scores of errors, and elections supervisors used it to remove voters without verifying its accuracy. A federal lawsuit led to an agreement to restore rights to thousands of voters.  The new list was released July 1, with officials saying Gov. Bush's administration was simply complying with federal election law. Problems with the list were quickly detected.  State officials have said there are people on the list who are not felons, and elections workers have flagged more than 300 people listed who might have received clemency.  Another problem was that about 2,700 people who had received clemency were still on the list. That was because they had registered to vote before they received clemency. The state initially required them to register again, but later backed off.  Gov. Bush, the president's brother, spoke with Hood early Saturday and agreed with the decision that her office made.  "It was the right thing to do,'' Bush said.  Since the 2000 election, the secretary of state's office has been moved from Cabinet status in Florida to an agency under the Republican governor.  Many Democrats were convinced state officials purposely culled too many voters from the rolls in order to ensure President Bush's re-election. Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe called it a ``potential careless and needless disfranchisement of thousands of voters.''  Civil rights advocates who wanted the list thrown out applauded the decision, but said some damage has already been done.  "Certainly there will be some people who received a letter, telling them effectively that they're going to be purged, who have been dissuaded from going to the polls altogether,'' said Jessie Allen, associate counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law.  State Sen. Les Miller, a Tampa Democrat who opposed the list, said he was pleased with Saturday's decision, but remained cautious.  "I still have a question mark in the back of my head, wondering what happens now,'' Miller said. "Are they saying 'that's it, we're not going to utilize it henceforth and forever more?' I need to know that.''  Bush said the list will not be available to elections supervisors until he's comfortable that it actually will be "a useful tool.''  Bush added, however, that he's concerned pulling back the list could mean "that more people who shouldn't be voting will be voting.''  Election officials emphasized that the list is intended to be a starting point for county election supervisors.  On Election Day, anyone who feels they have been inadvertently removed from the voter rolls will be allowed to use a provisional ballot that will be examined later to determine eligibility.

I notice the bit about them calling him names...what is he, in second grade? I also like the "drak underside" line - JG    NAACP Head Asks Bush to Rethink Convention Snub  By Jon Hurdle, Reuters   PHILADELPHIA (July 10) - The head of the largest and oldest U.S. civil rights group criticized President Bush on Saturday for once again refusing to speak at its convention this year and urged him to reconsider.  Kweisi Mfume, president of the NAACP, said it was "unbelievable" that Bush had declined an invitation to speak at the organization's annual meeting for the fourth consecutive year.  "When you are president, you are elected to be president of all the people," Mfume said at a news conference as the convention opened. "You won't do that if you refuse to talk."     He asked Bush to change his mind and promised that the Republican president would be treated with respect at the Philadelphia event this week even if many delegates oppose his politics.  A candidate who refuses to talk to any group risks losing votes in what is likely to be a tight presidential contest, Mfume said.  More than 12 million black people are registered to vote, according to the NAACP. Most are Democrats.  "I would ask the president to reconsider his unnecessarily harsh stance and to show America that he's bigger than that," he said.  Mfume, a former congressman from Maryland, said Bush was courteously received the last time he spoke to National Association for the Advancement of Colored People at its 2000 meeting in Baltimore.  Bush, campaigning in Pennsylvania on Friday, said he would not attend this year's NAACP event. He said his relationship with its leadership was "basically nonexistent" and he referred to being called "names" by organization members.  NAACP Chairman Julian Bond last month said Bush and other Republicans were part of a "dark underside of American culture."  Founded in 1909, the NAACP says it has 500,000 adult and youth members.    (on story below) More on the NAACP thing.  He obviously has written off black people.  All the campaigns have written off people under 25.  Bush has written off women who're under 30 & single.  Makes you wonder, if he's not considering them for votes, is he considering them for ANYTHING?    NAACP Chairman Condemns Bush Policies  By PATRICK WALTERS, AP  PHILADELPHIA (July 11) - NAACP chairman Julian Bond condemned Bush administration policies on education, the economy and the war in Iraq on Sunday, imploring members of the nation's oldest civil rights organization to increase voter turnout to oust the president from office.  ''They preach racial neutrality and practice racial division,'' Bond said Sunday night in the 95th annual convention's keynote address. ''They've tried to patch the leaky economy and every other domestic problem with duct tape and plastic sheets. They write a new constitution of Iraq and they ignore the Constitution here at home.''  Bond, a leader in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee during the 1960s civil rights movement and a Georgia legislator for 20 years, became chairman of the Baltimore-based National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1998.  During the Philadelphia convention, volunteers have been working on voter drives in black communities.  Leaders of the group are upset that President Bush has no plans to attend. Bush spoke at the 2000 NAACP convention in Baltimore when he was a candidate but has declined invitations to speak in each year of his presidency, officials said.  Democratic challenger John Kerry has accepted an invitation to speak Thursday on the final day of the convention, the NAACP said.    Assets, Edwards' and others'   And will the current map of battleground states hold?  Thursday, July 8, 2004 Posted: 2:59 PM EDT (1859 GMT)   Carlos Watson SPECIAL REPORT     (CNN) -- This week in The Inside Edge, I take a look at some of the less obvious sides of several issues.  First, some subtle points in John Edwards' favor as the newly announced running mate of John Kerry.   Then, another unexpected-help possibility.   And third, the lay of the land -- can we depend on a list of battleground states to stay the same all the way through the electoral skirmish to come?   Edwards' other assets    While conventional Democratic wisdom holds that John Edwards will contribute strong campaigning skills and some Southern appeal to this year's ticket, he may help John Kerry's team in a couple of other ways, as well.  First, in selecting Edwards, John Kerry is actually getting two great campaigners for the price of one. Not only is Edwards a good campaigner, but keep your eye on his wife Elizabeth (also a lawyer), who is an easygoing, affable person and a strong campaigner, herself.  Second, while many people have predicted that Edwards may help Kerry in the South and Midwest, don't be surprised if he proves to be an effective campaigner in the West and Southwest as well. Edwards' sunny personality and "Two Americas" message could be every bit as popular in New Mexico and Nevada as the Kerry team hopes they will be in Ohio and  Pennsylvania.  Third, Edwards' popularity among trial lawyers (arguably one of the three most important fund-raising groups for Democrats) may help him to raise even more money from that influential group for state parties and Democrats running for the Senate. In states like Louisiana, Florida and even his native South Carolina, that extra money (to be spent on  commercials and get-out-the-vote efforts) could make an important difference in a close election.  Fourth, in an era of photo-ops, the joint picture of the Kerry-Edwards families including Edwards' two young children may ultimately be a valuable and much-used image for the Democrats' ticket -- implicitly conveying warmth, vitality and family values. You can bet you will see this picture multiple times in the campaign -- in television ads, e-mails and more.  Finally, for all the ways that Edwards may help Kerry, the experience issue and his relationship with trial lawyers will be heavily scrutinized. Also, Edwards will very quickly have to prove that he can in fact be an asset in the South, particularly in his home state of North Carolina.   More unlikely help   Several months ago, I wrote about the possibility of Russia playing a crucial role in President Bush's re-election campaign by helping the Bush administration secure passage of a U.N. resolution and therefore move Iraq closer to stability. (Can Russia deliver votes for Bush?)  Sure enough, in June that happened and Russian President Vladimir Putin joined President Bush to announce the passage of a unanimous U.N. resolution on Iraq.  As Iraq enters a new phase, instead of turning to Germany or France, President Bush may once again look to an unlikely source for international help in Iraq.   In particular, the president may turn to the Arab world for critical support as more leaders there increasingly appreciate the risks to them of a failed Iraqi state. Last week, Jordan's King Abdullah II surprised many observers by suggesting that he would be willing to send troops to Iraq if asked. And don't be surprised in coming months to hear of new financial support for rebuilding Iraq from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and  new diplomatic support (and maybe more) from Egypt.  All three U.S. allies have played critical roles in past U.S. efforts in the Middle East, but have been largely silent during the recent engagement.   But again, the recent Iraqi-related events in Saudi Arabia (bombings and kidnappings) have reminded many in the region of the risks to them from Iraqi instability. Also, the fact that there are now Iraqi faces to deal with, too -- instead of just L. Paul Bremer -- may make helping out in Iraq a more palatable internal political option for some Arab  leaders.   The coming realignment   Generally, it's held that there are 17 to 19 battleground states in which the 2004 presidential election will be fought out to the bitter end. But don't be surprised to see some revisions in that list over the next two months.   Indeed, with the selection of a Democratic VP candidate, two major party conventions, hundreds of millions of dollars in political advertising, some vigorous Senate contests, Ralph Nader's impact and changes in the economy and Iraq, the political terrain may shift by the early fall in such a way that several states that seemed "in play" come off the list -- and several that did not seem competitive begin to draw more attention.  In the West, Washington (for Kerry) and Arizona (for Bush) could come off the battleground list by early fall.   In the South, I could envision Georgia, Virginia and/or North Carolina possibly becoming more competitive for Kerry and getting added attention, but Arkansas might lean more definitively for Bush.   In the North, I think Maine and Delaware (only peripherally mentioned even now by some Republicans) may come off the toss-up list and move toward Kerry.   In the Midwest, I expect that all the toss-up states will remain on the heated battleground list as we enter the fall.  Finally, it's worth noting that while some states may get taken off one side's target list, it does not mean that the final contest will or will not be close.  Witness Ohio, which was de-emphasized by Democrats at the end of the last presidential election, but turned out to be closer than either side expected (less than 4 percent).  Keep your eye out for these critical battleground map revisions as November 2 approaches.   (On story below)  I was hoping "Political Paddling" would be something else entirely.

FBI says Patriot Act used in Vegas strip club corruption probe  Associated Press ^ | 11-04-03  LAS VEGAS (AP) - The FBI used the USA Patriot Act to obtain financial information about key figures in a political corruption probe centered on striptease club owner Michael Galardi, an agent said.   Investigators used a section of the Patriot Act to get subpoenas for financial documents, said Special Agent Jim Stern, a spokesman for the Las Vegas FBI office.   "It was used appropriately by the FBI and was clearly within the legal parameters of the statute," Stern said.   The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported Tuesday that records were subpoenaed from Galardi, the owner of Jaguars in southern Nevada and Cheetah's in Las Vegas and San Diego; his lobbyist, former Clark County Commissioner Lance Malone; former Commissioner Erin Kenny; County Commission Chairwoman Mary Kincaid-Chauncey; former County Commission Chairman Dario Herrera; and Las Vegas City Councilman Michael McDonald, who lost a re-election bid in June.   The Patriot Act, passed after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was originally touted by the government as a tool to help federal law enforcers combat and prevent terrorism.   Civil libertarians have criticized the Bush administration for employing the wide-ranging act to also crack down on drug traffickers and child pornographers.   The measure lets federal investigators seek financial records of people suspected of being terrorists or laundering money.   Malone's lawyer called it an outrage that the FBI used anti-terrorism measures in an effort to gather information on his client.   "The Patriot Act ... clearly was not intended for this," Las Vegas lawyer Dominic Gentile said.   Gary Peck, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, said the Patriot Act included provisions "that in no way had anything to do with the threat of terrorism, but could help them in your more garden variety criminal prosecutions."   Attorney Richard Wright, who represents McDonald, said he was unaware investigators had used Patriot Act powers.   "It isn't anything that's lawfully known," he said.   Federal authorities in San Diego say Galardi and Malone paid San Diego city officials to lift a ban on contact between topless dancers and their customers. Malone and three San Diego city councilmen await trial on public corruption charges.   A federal grand jury in Las Vegas also has been hearing evidence regarding allegations of public corruption in southern Nevada. No indictments have been announced in that case.    (on story below) Here is an article where a Justice guy says the PA wasn't "just for going after terrorists"    Using the Patriot Act in Vegas strip clubs  November 12, 2003  By: Clarence Page Chicago Tribune   WASHINGTON - In our latest episode of continuing adventures with the USA Patriot Act, FBI agents say they've used the new anti- terrorism law to prosecute a political bribery case centered on the owner of some Las Vegas strip clubs. What do topless dancers in Vegas have to do with terrorism, you may ask? Nothing, everyone agrees, unless perhaps you count the violence that some of the ladies inflict on the wallets of their  clientele.   Nevertheless, the FBI now confirms local Las Vegas newspaper reports that the agency used the Patriot Act's provisions to subpoena financial information about four local politicians and one local businessman, Michael D. Galardi, the owner of the Jaguars strip club in Las Vegas and Cheetahs clubs in Las Vegas and San Diego.   The Patriot Act, passed in the panicky weeks after 9/11, allows the government to peek into the personal affairs of many people, not just suspected terrorists. The law's powers only begin with suspected terrorists. We have yet to learn how far it extends.   That's the part that Attorney General John Ashcroft does not talk about much as he tours the country touting the powers the Patriot Act has given the federal government to fight terrorism.   "We have used these tools to save innocent American lives," Mr. Ashcroft told a convention of law officers at the federal courthouse in Las Vegas in August. "We have used these tools to provide the security that ensures liberty."   He neglected to mention how, even as he spoke, Las Vegas FBI agents were using those "tools" to go after a strip club owner and the politicians he allegedly paid off.   It turns out that Section 314 of the Patriot Act allows federal investigators wider leeway in obtaining financial information from stockbrokers, banks and other financial institutions on people "suspected, based on credible evidence, of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering." Pay close attention to that last phrase: "or money laundering." Ah, what legal power that little word "or" contains. Thanks to that teeny  but mighty conjunction, the Patriot Act is not limited to money laundering that is linked to suspected terrorist acts but to any suspected money laundering.   "The Patriot Act was not meant to be just for terrorism," Justice Department spokesman Mark Corallo told a reporter.   Now they tell us.   Before the Patriot Act became law, FBI agents needed a subpoena from a grand jury to demand financial records. Under Section 314, agents no longer need trouble themselves with facing a grand jury, which is, after all, made up of only ordinary citizens. Instead, agents need only certify in a secret documentation a reasonable suspicion that money laundering is taking place.   Only after the case comes to trial can a judge rule on whether the agents' certification was adequate. If not, the judge can throw out all the evidence gathered as a result of the bogus certification, according to the Justice Department spokesmen.   Why, one wonders, is the normal subpoena process such a bother all of a sudden? Since when it is so hard to prosecute public corruption in Las Vegas, a possibility that rivals gambling in Casablanca on most people's shock-o-meters?   The Justice Department spokesman said the American people expect law enforcement officers to use any and all constitutional and legal tools to fight all crime, whether it is terror-related or not.   Maybe that's so. After all, it is just allegedly corrupt politicians and strip club owners we're talking about here and not the sort of people for whom, say, the Moral Majority would go to bat.   Most anti-abortion groups probably felt that way about the federal RICO (Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) law until pro-choice groups persuaded the federal government to use it against aggressive protests at abortion clinics. Anti- abortion groups cheered when the Supreme Court overturned that use of anti-crime law last spring in Scheidler vs. NOW. Now we shall wait to see how many of them join hands with civil libertarians as the government overreaches with the Patriot Act.   Some members of Congress on both sides of the aisle are expressing reservations about the potential for wretched governmental excesses under the Patriot Act. Fortunately, the law must be renewed in 2005. That gives Congress time to reconsider its 342 pages in a calmer atmosphere than that which followed the 2001 terrorist attacks.   I hope they debate wisely. Concern for civil liberties should be equally important to both political parties. After all, the privacy you save may be your own.

						    WASHINGTON (AFP) - Inquiries into the mistakes of the US intelligence services ahead of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks and leading up to the US-led war on Iraq are taking a toll on President George W. Bush's reelection efforts.   Republican Bush is to face Democrat John Kerry in the November 2 presidential election. Bush and Kerry are nearly evenly split in opinion polls.   "Leading up to September 11, our government didn't connect the dots," said Democratic Senator John Rockefeller on Friday. "In Iraq, we are even more culpable because the dots themselves never existed."   Rockefeller made the comments after the release of a Senate report that concluded Bush's main reason for going to war with the regime of Saddam Hussein in March 2003 was hollow, because Iraq had no banned chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.   Bush acknowledged some intelligence failures. "Listen, we thought there was going to be stockpiles of weapons. I thought so, the Congress thought so, the UN thought so," Bush said on Friday.   Bush, however, insisted that Saddam "had the capacity to make weapons. He had the ability to make them. We haven't found the stockpiles but we do know he can make them, so he is a dangerous man."   And he pounded away on a line he has repeated often: "The world is better off without Saddam Hussein in power. America is safer."   The war on terror -- especially on Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network, responsible for the September 2001 attacks that left some 3,000 dead in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania -- and the US-led invasion of Iraq are key components of Bush's reelection campaign.   Bush seeks to portray himself as a "war president" and as the candidate best qualified to defend the nation.   But the president's position could be further eroded by conclusions from the independent bipartisan panel investigating the September 11 attacks. The panel is due to release its report by the end of the month.   The final report will be vetted by the Central Intelligence Agency (news - web sites) to make sure all information that could threaten US national security is censored before publication.   The panel's public hearings have already produced information embarrassing to the Bush administration, including the existence of an August 6, 2001 memo titled "Bin Laden determined to attack inside the US."   A second part of the Senate report, due to examine Bush's use of the flawed intelligence, will come only after the November election, over protests of opposition Democrats.   The Senate report released Friday "does not acknowledge that the intelligence estimates were shaped by the administration," said California Senator Dianne Feinstein and a committee member.   "In my view, this remains an open question and needs more scrutiny," she said.   Also upcoming: results from an inquiry into who, allegedly in the White House, leaked the name of CIA agent Valerie Plame to news reporters. Revealing an agent's name is a federal crime.   The leak was apparently made in an attempt to discredit Plame's husband, Joseph Wilson, a US diplomat who publicly cast doubt on Bush's claim that Saddam's government was seeking uranium in Niger for an alleged nuclear program.   A US Justice Department special prosecutor has been looking into the case for weeks, and has interviewed top White House officials, including Bush himself.

						    Regarding this story: This rehashes the last one, but has additional statements from a Republican congressman saying that they need these powers to keep up with criminals, not just terrorists, and that's why they should renew the law & keep all its powers.  Notice that some of the FBI guys say THEY didn't even knwo the PA was used for this??  Who's in charge?   Patriot Act gets mixed review in Vegas  Its use in investigation of strip clubs questioned By Steve Friess, Globe Correspondent, 11/8/2003  LAS VEGAS -- This scandal has everything: Top politicians indicted on multiple counts of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from the owner of local strip clubs in exchange for looser regulations of what strippers can do.     But what has this got to do with terrorism?  Nothing at all, everybody involved agrees. Yet FBI agents in Las Vegas used a provision of the USA Patriot Act to obtain the financial records of several suspects in the case. It is one of more than a dozen cases in which federal investigators have relied on the Patriot Act -- passed a month after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, as a response to terrorism -- for purposes unrelated to homeland security, according to The New  York Times.  Part of the law, Section 314, allows federal investigators to obtain from stockbrokers, banks, and other financial institutions the records of people "suspected, based on credible evidence, of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering." Since the law does not specifically require that the money laundering relate to terrorism, the application in a public corruption probe such as "Operation G-Sting" is permissible.  "What it points out is how certain aspects of the Patriot Act are so expansive that they allow for invasions of people's basic rights in ways that go far beyond reasonable national security needs," said Allen Lichtenstein, attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada.  A Justice Department spokesman, Mark Corallo, insisted the section was inserted at the request of then-Senate Banking Committee chairman Paul Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, who sought to give the FBI new tools to fight money laundering. The provision allows an FBI agent to demand financial records without a grand jury subpoena by certifying that the suspicion of money laundering is reasonable. If a judge at trial believes  the certification is inadequate, the judge may throw out the evidence, Corallo said.  "The Patriot Act was not meant to be just for terrorism," Corallo said. "A lot of the uninformed criticism was obviously misplaced."  The FBI office in Las Vegas has said Section 314 was applied in the corruption case, but would not confirm local news reports that it was used to subpoena records from the stockbrokers of the Clark County Commission chairwoman, Mary Kincaid-Chauncey; former commissioners Dario Herrera, Erin Kenny, and Lance Malone; Las Vegas City Councilman Michael Mack; and club owner Michael Galardi. The commission regulates areas outside  the city limits.  In a 28-count indictment handed down Thursday, Kincaid-Chauncey, Herrera, and Malone were charged with accepting thousands of dollars in bribes from Galardi. Malone was also accused of acting as a middle man between Galardi and the commissioners after he left office in 2000. Also Thursday, guilty pleas from Galardi and Kenny were unsealed. In them, Galardi admitted to giving as much as $400,000 in kickbacks to commissioners, and Kenny conceded she took bribes via Malone in exchange for voting for laws favorable to Galardi's clubs.  Kenny was the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, and Herrera was a Democratic nominee for Congress in 2002. Both lost. It is unclear how Mack may be involved in the case.  The FBI probe also has resulted in the August indictment of three San Diego City councilmen on similar charges of taking Galardi's bribes through Malone in exchange for preferential treatment. The California councilmen have pleaded not guilty; the Nevada politicians are scheduled to be arraigned Nov. 21.  Kenny's lawyer, Frank Cremen, said the perplexing part of the use of the Patriot Act was that prosecutors could have subpoenaed the financial records using other laws, although not as quickly. "Quite truthfully, I don't know why they used it, but it's going to have no impact on my client," Cremen said.  But the disclosures have led to sharp rebukes from Senator Harry Reid and Representative Shelley Berkley, both Nevada Democrats. Berkley, who represents Las Vegas, has sent a letter to Attorney General John Ashcroft asking whether he believes this use of the law was appropriate.  "When I voted for the Patriot Act one day and one month after Sept. 11, I was voting to give the FBI the necessary tools to fight terrorism," Berkley said. "It was never my intention that this act would be used in garden-variety crime or political corruption cases."  Reid said this is another reminder that a careful review of the act is in order when it comes up for renewal in 2005. "We have to be tough on terrorists, but we also have to guard the privacy of American citizens," he said.  But Representative Jim Gibbons, Republican of Nevada, said the Patriot Act was designed not only to enhance antiterrorist activities, but also to modernize the way the FBI conducts investigations.  "Criminals nowadays use cheap, throwaway cellular phones and free e-mail accounts, but the laws did not address those things," said Amy Spanbauer, a spokeswoman for Gibbons. "This empowers law enforcement to keep up with modern technology so they are not hamstrung as terrorists run free."

						    By SCOTT LINDLAW, AP  WASHINGTON (July 11) - When an influential group of conservatives gathers in downtown Washington each week, they often get a political pep talk from a senior Bush administration official or campaign aide. They don't expect a fellow Republican to deliver a blistering critique of President Bush's handling of the Iraq war.  But nearly 150 conservatives listened in silence recently as a veteran of the Nixon, Ford and Reagan administrations ticked off a litany of missteps in Iraq by the Bush White House.  "This war is not going well," said Stefan Halper, a deputy assistant secretary of state under President Reagan.  "It's costing us a lot of money, isolating us from our allies and friends," said Halper, who gave $1,000 to George W. Bush's campaign and more than $83,000 to other GOP causes in 2000. "This is not the cakewalk the neoconservatives predicted. We were not greeted with flowers in the streets."  Conservatives, the backbone of Bush's political base, are increasingly uneasy about the Iraq conflict and the steady drumbeat of violence in postwar Iraq, Halper and some of his fellow Republicans say. The conservatives' anxiety was fueled by the Abu Ghraib prisoner-abuse scandal and has not abated with the transfer of political power to the interim Iraqi government.  Some Republicans fear angry conservatives will stay home in November, undercutting Bush's re-election bid.  "I don't think there's any question that there is growing restiveness in the Republican base about this war," said Halper, the co-author of a new book, "America Alone: The Neoconservatives and the Global Order."  Some Republicans dismiss the rift as little more than an inside-the-Beltway spat among rival factions of the GOP intelligentsia. Indeed, conservatives nationwide are still firmly behind Bush. A Pew Research Center poll last month found that 97 percent of conservative Republicans favored Bush over Kerry.  But anger is simmering among some conservatives.  "I am bitterly disappointed in his actions with this war. It is a total travesty," said Tom Hutchinson, 69, a self-described conservative from Sturgeon, Mo., who posted yard signs and staffed campaign phone banks for the Republican in 2000. Hutchinson said he did not believe the administration's stated rationales for the war, in particular the argument that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.  Hutchinson, a retired businessman and former college professor, said his unease with Iraq may lead him to do something he has not done since 1956: avoid the voting booth in a presidential election.  Jack Walters, 59, a self-described "classical conservative" from Columbia, Mo., said he hadn't decided which candidate to vote for.  "Having been through Vietnam, I thought no, never again," Walters said. "But here comes the same thing again, and I'm old enough to recognize the lame reasons given for going into Iraq, and they made me ill."  The tension has been building in official Washington, where conservative members of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees have pressed the administration for answers on combat operations; disagreed with the Pentagon on troop levels; and expressed frustration with an administration they feel has shown them disdain by withholding information.  Chief political adviser Karl Rove's formula for re-election is primarily to push Bush's conservative base to the polls.  Another administration official involved in Bush's re-election effort has voiced concern that angry conservatives will sit out the election.  But Matthew Dowd, the Bush-Cheney campaign's chief strategist, described the fear of losing conservative support as "just ludicrous."  Bush is "as strong among conservative Republicans as any Republican president has been" - higher than President Reagan's approval among conservatives during his re-election campaign of 1984, Dowd said.  Yet, Halper said his critical review on the administration's performance on Iraq last week was met with expressions of support in the conservatives' weekly meeting, which is closed to journalists.  The marquee speaker sent by the administration was Eric Ciliberti, who spent several weeks in Iraq this year and told the audience of broad progress being made there.  Ciliberti complained to the group that the news media was not reporting the positive developments out of Iraq. Ciliberti did not return several calls late in the past week from a reporter seeking his account.

						    This is NOT GOOD. And it's something Joe saw coming from MILES AWAY.  ::begin article:: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. counterterrorism officials are looking at an emergency proposal on the legal steps needed to postpone the November presidential election in case of an attack by al Qaeda, Newsweek reported on Sunday.   Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge warned last week that Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network may attack within the United States to try to disrupt the election.   The magazine cited unnamed sources who told it that the Department of Homeland Security asked the Justice Department last week to review what legal steps would be needed to delay the election if an attack occurred on the day before or the day of the election.   The department was asked to review a letter to Ridge from DeForest Soaries, who is the chairman of the new U.S. Election Assistance Commission, the magazine said.   The commission was created in 2002 to provide funds to the states to the replace punch card voting systems and provide other assistance in conducting federal elections.   In his letter, Soaries pointed out that while New York's Board of Elections suspended primary elections in New York on the day of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, "the federal government has no agency that has the statutory authority to cancel and reschedule a federal election."   Soaries wants Ridge to ask Congress to pass legislation giving the government such power, Newsweek reported in its latest issue that hits the newsstands on Monday.   Homeland Security Department spokesman Brian Rochrkasse told the magazine the agency is reviewing the matter "to determine what steps need to be taken to secure the election."   ::end article::  How did he know...?

						    By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer   WASHINGTON - Now that a Senate committee has concluded the CIA falsely claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, expect more caution on Capitol Hill the next time a president seeks approval for pre-emptive military action. But don't expect America to strike only after an attack.   Even the harshest critics of the Bush administration's policy of pre-emption say the United States must act in the face of a clear threat.   What is a clear threat? Can the public trust what U.S. intelligence says about that threat?   "Iraq was the first case of pre-emptive war by the United States, and we have learned an important lesson — that pre-emptive war depends on good, actionable intelligence," said Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif.   "In this case, the intelligence was both bad and wrong," said Feinstein, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which just released its report on prewar intelligence about Iraq.   Months before the Iraq invasion in March 2003, the White House published a "national security strategy." It abandoned the Cold War reliance on deterring potential enemies with overwhelming military strength — and nuclear weapons.   The Sept. 11 attacks showed that America cannot rely on deterrence and must at times strike to prevent attacks, Bush reasoned.   The public version of the document left unstated the implied threat of using nuclear weapons to strike first against weapons of mass destruction.   "The United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have in the past," Bush wrote. "We cannot let our enemies strike first."   Critics, including many Democrats, say the emphasis on pre-emption needlessly antagonized U.S. allies and projected an image of America as a military giant willing to shoot first and ask questions later.   "It really contributed to this sense of an out of control, cowboy foreign policy," said analyst Michael O'Hanlon of the liberal Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.   The administration and its supporters say abandoning a policy of pre-emptive war would only invite attacks on the United States. They contend the war in Iraq was justified even if Iraq had no chemical or biological weapons because President Saddam Hussein had a longing for such weapons and had used them in the past.   "You have to be an idiot not to attack someone when you're convinced they're ready to attack you," said Michael Ledeen of the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank ideologically aligned with the administration.   "Governments are paid to protect us against worst-case scenarios, not to think the best about potential enemies and hope things will work out," Ledeen said.   Democratic criticism of Bush's pre-emption policy has been nuanced, acknowledging that first strikes can be necessary, especially during the fight against terrorism.   The Democratic Party's platform, for example, reserves the right for a pre-emptive war if candidate John Kerry becomes president.   Like Kerry, the platform says Bush has damaged American credibility and strained relations with allies by appearing to act unilaterally. Democrats say Bush should have built more international consensus for action against Iraq rather than planning to invade and then asking for support.   Bush and administration officials bristle at the use of the word unilateral to describe the war, saying that 30 countries have joined the coalition that ousted Saddam.   Regardless of politics, members of both parties now say Congress will demand more detailed and accurate information before agreeing to any future military action, no matter who is president.   "The shaping of intelligence and analysis over this year and a half has called into question the basis for America's military action in Iraq," said Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.   "This cannot happen again."  __   EDITOR'S NOTE — Matt Kelley covers military issues for The Associated Press.    AmericanGoddess' Editorial: So what's to stop any other nation from attacking the US first? See, this policy of premptive striking is good for both the goose and the gander - and it's going to open up a whole snotload of opportunity for ANYONE to attack the US first, because we DO have WMDs and lots of them, and we MIGHT use them on another country. And they know it.

						    Many readers may wonder, why is she doing this? Why has she created this blog? What difference does it make what Bush does anyway? Why come down so hard on him?  Because that man - whose military service is in question, whom I believe is ordering records of his service destroyed, who refused to serve in combat himself, who lied to the American people about why we attacked Iraq - has the blood of people such as Kenneth Conde Jr on his hands. And this is BULLSHIT. This demonstrates a truly evil mind, a complete lack of morality and sense of ethical behavior...and all to protect his precious money.   So who is this Kenneth Conde Jr? Have a gander at this story from the Orlando Sentinel:  :: begin story ::  Marine Sgt. Kenneth Conde Jr. confided to his grandmother shortly before he was killed that he was tired and wanted to come home.  "Grandma, this is a hellhole," Norma Conde, 72, said he told her by phone from Iraq. "Grandma, I'm tired of killing. I'm tired of body parts. I'm tired, and I want to come home."  Norma Conde paused as she related the story, gazing up toward the high ceiling inside Aloma Baptist Church in Winter Park, where about 300 people gathered Friday for Conde's funeral.  The Orlando infantryman was killed July 1 in Al Anbar province in an explosion that injured five other Marines. Conde, nicknamed "Kee-Kee" since birth, died eight days after his 23rd birthday.  "You heard him, Lord," said Norma Conde, raising her arms. "You heard our Kee-Kee. And you brought him home."  Although Conde yearned to return to his family in Orlando, he stayed in Iraq even after he was wounded and had the chance to leave. In April, Conde was shot in the shoulder in Ramadi, where insurgents fired at his platoon with submachine guns.  Conde refused to be airlifted to a hospital and kept firing until all the insurgents were killed. A corpsman treated his wounds on the battlefield, and Conde stayed with his platoon. Conde decided to complete his tour of duty and return home with the others in September.  On Friday, Kenneth Conde Sr. kissed his son's flag-draped coffin and accepted a Bronze Star medal awarded to his son for combat heroism in Iraq.  "Semper Fi -- always faithful," said Conde Sr., a retired 17-year Marine whom his only son sought to emulate. "That's what I taught my son, and that's why we're here today."  The crowd swayed, clapped and joined in as a blue-and-plum-gowned choir repeated the lyrics: "I ain't gonna study war no more, no more ..."  Then the Rev. Anthony George stepped to the podium behind Conde's coffin and quoted John 15:13.  "Kenneth didn't just decide to go back to the battlefield for kicks," George told the crowd. "He went back for the sake of others. 'Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.'"  Enormous photos of Conde covered the walls during a slide show of his brief life.  Kee-Kee as a toddler, wearing a Smurf birthday hat, blowing out candles on his cake. Little Kee-Kee smiling broadly, showing missing front teeth. Another of him proudly holding his pet turtle. A preteen Kee-Kee with his baby sister in his lap.  Most of the photos show Conde with a long, lanky arm wrapped protectively over the shoulder of his mother or one of his sisters. Another shows him laughing with his father.  Others show him with his fiancee, Yuri Ozaki, whom he met while stationed in Japan. At those slides, Ozaki, who traveled from Japan to attend the funeral, cried out as she huddled with Conde's mother, Theresa.  The photos taken at the end of his life show Conde in the Iraqi desert wearing a camouflage uniform and facial camouflage. This time, his lanky arms were around the shoulders of his fellow Marines.  At his funeral, Conde's two sisters had a message for their big brother.  Kenesa Conde, 11, remembered her brother's sensitive side, how he liked to draw cartoons and write poetry.  "You did what you needed to do," Kenesa said, wearing two long pigtails, a polka-dot dress and a pink sash. "You held on as long as you could. And I'll see you in heaven."  Kimberly Conde, 18, remembered building forts with her brother.  "Remember that one in California we built?" Kimberly said. "Remember how we got so dirty? That was the best one." She recalled all-night talks with her brother as they sat around the kitchen table. She laughed remembering how he danced.  "You had zero rhythm," she said in one of the few light moments during the three-hour funeral.  "I'm the oldest child now. Don't worry, Kee-Kee, I won't let this family fall apart. I won't let you down."  Nine-year-old Jade Green said that as an airplane brought her from her home in New York to Orlando, she looked out the window and thought of her cousin's pain.  "I wanted to feel all the pain that he must have felt," Jade told the crowd. "And today, I think I do."  Outside, the BOOM-BOOM-BOOM of shots rang out during a 21-gun salute for the fallen Marine. Some of Conde's family members wept openly at the sound of gunfire.  After the funeral, people from the community who had never before met the Condes waited in a long line to offer them comfort.  One was Nina Schrage, whose son, Marine Cpl. Dustin H. Schrage, 20, was killed as he attempted to swim across the Euphrates River in a covert mission. His body was recovered in early May in Al Anbar province, along with the body of another infantryman.  Dustin Schrage belonged to the same unit as Conde -- the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division. Like Conde, Schrage also had been expected home in September, his mother said.  Nina Schrage came to the funeral from Indian Harbour Beach to be with the Condes.  When she met Kenneth Conde Sr., the two embraced for a long while.  "My heart just breaks for you all," she told the Condes. "We are now part of the same family. Our boys are up there. They are watching the gates of heaven. And they're kicking butt and taking names."  At a private memorial Thursday, Conde's family gathered at Collison's Howell Branch Funeral Home in Winter Park.  Kenneth Conde Sr. read a poem to the small gathering he wrote one night after his son's death when he couldn't sleep:   War in my eyes is it realized the dangerous steps I take?  I don't know, but I have a job to do.  And if the price is my life, I will carry my mission through.   "My son has been put on a pedestal and now no one can touch him," Conde Sr. told the gathering. "To others he's Marine Sergeant Kenneth Conde killed in Iraq. To us, his family, he was our Kee-Kee."  Then, the half-filled room was quiet except for the piercing sound of a grieving mother's wail.  "My baby!" cried Theresa Conde, waving her fists in front of her face as she sat at her son's coffin.  "I want my baby back!" she cried. "My heart is just broke. And for what? For what?"  :: end story ::  Except the story doesn't end here.   It's hardly begun.   The next generation of Iraqis will remember how THIS generation of Americans treated them, and they will make sure the next generation of Americans PAY FOR the flaws of THIS generation.   I can only hope that in the name of people like the Conde family, many Iraqis will find it in their hearts to forgive us.....not every American wanted this. I'm sure they didn't want their Kee-Kee to die in a war like this, for this dishonest SOB in the White House and for such idiocy as his precious money.   Really, Bush shoud be impeached. Why is it that the whole fucking country was so worried about Clinton's sex life, when this subject had nothing to do with war and national security and all that - but Bush is doing things just as dishonest and playing with soldiers' lives and no one is investigating HIM? The average American isn't demanding his impeachment. WTF is this???

						    "There was no mention of the loss, for example, when White House officials released hundreds of pages of the President's military records last February in an effort to stem Democratic accusations that he was AWOL."   July 9, 2004   Pentagon Says Bush Records of Service Were Destroyed   By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   HOUSTON, July 8 - Military records that could help establish President Bush's whereabouts during his disputed service in the Texas Air National Guard more than 30 years ago have been inadvertently destroyed, according to the Pentagon.   It said the payroll records of "numerous service members," including former First Lt. Bush, had been ruined in 1996 and 1997 by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service during a project to salvage deteriorating microfilm. No back-up paper copies could be found, it added in notices dated June 25.   The destroyed records cover three months of a period in 1972 and 1973 when Mr. Bush's claims of service in Alabama are in question.   The disclosure appeared to catch some experts, both pro-Bush and con, by surprise. Even the retired lieutenant colonel who studied Mr. Bush's records for the White House, Albert C. Lloyd of Austin, said it came as news to him.   The loss was announced by the Defense Department's Office of Freedom of Information and Security Review in letters to The New York Times and other news organizations that for nearly half a year have sought Mr. Bush's complete service file under the open-records law.   There was no mention of the loss, for example, when White House officials released hundreds of pages of the President's military records last February in an effort to stem Democratic accusations that he was "AWOL" for a time during his commitment to fly at home in the Air National Guard during the Vietnam War.   Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director who has said that the released records confirmed the president's fulfillment of his National Guard commitment, did not return two calls for a response.   The disclosure that the payroll records had been destroyed came in a letter signed by C. Y. Talbott, chief of the Pentagon's Freedom of Information Office, who forwarded a CD-Rom of hundreds of records that Mr. Bush has previously released, along with images of punch-card records. Sixty pages of Mr. Bush's medical file and some other records were excluded on privacy grounds, Mr. Talbott wrote.   He said in the letter that he could not provide complete payroll records, explaining, "The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) has advised of the inadvertent destruction of microfilm containing certain National Guard payroll records."   He went on: "In 1996 and 1997, DFAS engaged with limited success in a project to salvage deteriorating microfilm. During this process the microfilm payroll records of numerous service members were damaged, including from the first quarter of 1969 (Jan. 1 to March 31) and the third quarter of 1972 (July 1 to Sept. 30). President Bush's payroll records for these two quarters were among the records destroyed. Searches for backup paper copies of the missing records were unsuccessful."   Mr. Talbott's office would not respond to questions, saying that further information could be provided only through another Freedom of Information application.   But Bryan Hubbard, a spokesman for Defense finance agency in Denver, said the destruction occurred as the office was trying to unspool 2,000-foot rolls of fragile microfilm. Mr. Hubbard said he did not know how many records were lost or why the loss had not been announced before.   For Mr. Bush, the 1969 period when he was training to be a pilot, is not in dispute. But in May 1972, he moved to Alabama to work on a political campaign and, he has said, to perform his Guard service there for a year. But other Guard officers have said they had no recollection of ever seeing him there. The most evidence the White House has been able to find are records showing Mr. Bush was paid for six days in October and November 1972, without saying where, and the record of a dental exam at a Montgomery, Ala., air base on Jan. 6, 1973.   On June 22, The Associated Press filed suit in federal court in New York against the Pentagon and the Air Force to gain access to all the president's military records.   The lost payroll records stored in Denver might have answered some questions about whether he fulfilled his legal commitment, critics who have written about the subject said in interviews.   "Those are records we've all been interested in," said James Moore, author of a recent book, "Bush's War for Re-election," which takes a critical view of Mr. Bush's service record. "I think it's curious that the microfiche could resolve what days Mr. Bush worked and what days he was paid, and suddenly that is gone."   But Mr. Moore said the president could still authorize the release of other withheld records that would shed light on his service record.   Among the issues still disputed is why, according to released records, Mr. Bush was suspended from flying on Aug. 1, 1972. The reason cited in the records is "failure to accomplish annual medical examination."   Mr. Bartlett, the White House spokesman, said in February that Mr. Bush felt he did not need to take the physical as he was no longer flying planes in Alabama. Mr. Lloyd, the retired colonel who studied the records, gave a similar explanation in an interview.   But Mr. Lloyd said he was surprised to be told of the destruction of the pay records that might have resolved some questions.   New York Times   AmericanGoddess Editorial: As I understand it, Bush didn't go AWOL, but was marked as "FTR" or Failure To Report. This as a certain Army veteran explained to me. But it goes to show how important it is to at least attempt to get one's terminology straight.  DLi's Editorial: Isn't funny that only those records around 1972-73 were 'inadvertently' lost? There should be a citizens' demand for a full Congressional investigation into the circumstances of those 'lost records.' Exactly how many servicemen's records were lost, how were they 'lost,' when did the proper authorities find out when they were lost, and who is accountable for such losses???

						    Here is the text of an email that has been circulating amongst many people, trying desperately to make the Democrats look bad so they will lose the election:   Q: Which party took Social Security from an independent fund and put it in the general fund so that Congress could spend it?  A: It was Lyndon Johnson and the Democratic-controlled House and Senate.  Q: Which party put a tax on Social Security?  A: The Democratic party.  Q: Which party increased the tax on Social Security?  A: The Democratic Party with Al Gore casting the deciding vote.  Q. Which party decided to give money to immigrants?  A: That's right, immigrants moved into this country at 65 and got SSI Social Security. The Democratic Party gave that to them although they never paid a dime into it.   Then, after doing all this, the Democrats turn around and tell you the Republicans want to take your Social Security.  And the worst part about it is, people believe it!   Now, here's the refutation of this email, point by point - I shall put false statements in bold red text:    Q: Which party took Social Security from an independent fund and put it in the general fund so that Congress could spend it?  A: It was Lyndon Johnson and the Democratic-controlled House and Senate.    FALSE  These articles should help to clear up the misconceptions.  From the Cato Institute  urlLink SSP Report No. 24 p. 6    "All of those proposals reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the trust fund. Social Security payroll taxes are currently bringing in more revenue than the program pays out in benefits, a surplus that is projected to continue until approximately 2016. Thereafter, the situation will reverse, with Social Security paying out more in benefits than it brings in through taxes. The surplus is used to purchase special issue Treasury bonds. The Social Security surplus used to purchase the bonds becomes general revenue and is spent on the government's annual general operating expenses. What remains behind in the trust fund is the bonds, plus an interest payment attributed to the bonds (also paid in bonds, rather than cash). Government bonds are, in essence, a form of IOU. They are a promise against future tax revenue. When the bonds become due, the government will have to repay them out of general revenue."    urlLink "The Social Security Trust Fund is an accounting fiction."   The Social Security tax has been raising more money than is needed to pay for current benefits, in order to build up a surplus to help finance the retirement of the Baby Boom generation. All of this surplus is lent to the U.S. Treasury when the Social Security Trust Fund buys bonds from it. The money is then used to finance the federal deficit, just like any other money the government borrows. The bonds held by the fund pay the same interest as bonds held by the public. These bonds are every bit as real (or as much of a fiction) as the bonds held by banks, corporations, and individuals. Throughout U.S. history the federal government has always paid its debts. As a result, government bonds enjoy the highest credit ratings and are considered one of the safest assets in the world. Thus the fund has very real and secure assets."    urlLink "Trust Funds: A Healthy Picture"   Although "trust fund" is the term generally used, there are actually four trust funds - two for Social Security and two for Medicare. At the last accounting, they held assets totaling almost $1.3 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office projects they will grow by $2.5 trillion over the next decade. Their holdings consist of U.S. securities currently earning 6.9 percent."   These are the 4 Funds: It is in Public Law No: 104-121. http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c104:1:./temp/~c1040uihHp:e30331: H.R.3136  Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996 (Enrolled as Agreed to or Passed by Both House and Senate)  SEC. 107.

He pushed and signed the legislation for Medicare benefits. He went to Independence Missouri, Harry Truman's home town, to sign it. LBJ signed Harry's card as the first recipient. These are some of his words  urlLink **click**    Remarks With President Truman at the Signing in Independence of the Medicare Bill--July 30, 1965   "PRESIDENT TRUMAN. Thank you very much. I am glad you like the President. I like him too. He is one of the finest men I ever ran across.  Mr. President, Mrs. Johnson, distinguished guests:  You have done me a great honor in coming here today, and you have made me a very, very happy man.   This is an important hour for the Nation, for those of our citizens who have completed their tour of duty and have moved to the sidelines. These are the days that we are trying to celebrate for them. These people are our prideful responsibility and they are entitled, among other benefits, to the best medical protection available.  Not one of these, our citizens, should ever be abandoned to the indignity of charity. Charity is indignity when you have to have it. But we don't want these people to have anything to do with charity and we don't want them to have any idea of hopeless despair.  Mr. President, I am glad to have lived this long and to witness today the signing of the Medicare bill which puts this Nation right where it needs to be, to be right. Your inspired leadership and a responsive forward-looking Congress have made it historically possible for this day to come about.   Thank all of you most highly for coming here. It is an honor I haven't had for, well, quite awhile, I'll say that to you, but here it is:"  THE PRESIDENT. "The people of the United States love and voted for Harry Truman, not because he gave them hell--but because he gave them hope.  I believe today that all America shares my joy that he is present now when the hope that he offered becomes a reality for millions of our fellow citizens.  I am so proud that this has come to pass in the Johnson Administration. But it was really Harry Truman of Missouri who planted the seeds of compassion and duty which have today flowered into care for the sick, and serenity for the fearful.  Many men can make many proposals. Many men can draft many laws. But few have the piercing and humane eye which can see beyond the words to the people that they touch. Few can see past the speeches and the political battles to the doctor over there that is tending the infirm, and to the hospital that is receiving those in anguish, or feel in their heart painful wrath it the injustice which denies the miracle of healing to the old and to the poor. And fewer still have the courage to stake reputation, and position, and the effort of a lifetime upon such a cause when there are so few that share it.  But it is just such men who illuminate the life and the history of a nation. And so, President Harry Truman, it is in tribute not to you, but to the America that you represent, that we have come here to pay our love and our respects to you today. For a country can be known by the quality of the men it honors. By praising you, and by carrying forward your dreams, we really reaffirm the greatness of America.  It was a generation ago that Harry Truman said, and I quote him: "Millions of our citizens do not now have a full measure of opportunity to achieve and to enjoy good health. Millions do not now have protection or security against the economic effects of sickness. And the time has now arrived for action to help them attain that opportunity and to help them get that protection."  Well, today, Mr. President, and my fellow Americans, we are taking such action--20 years later. And we are doing that under the great leadership of men like John McCormack, our Speaker; Carl Albert, our majority leader; our very able and beloved majority leader of the Senate, Mike Mansfield; and distinguished Members of the Ways and Means and Finance Committees of the House and Senate--of both parties, Democratic and Republican.  Because the need for this action is plain; and it is so clear indeed that we marvel not simply at the passage of this bill, but what we marvel at is that it took so many years to pass it. And I am so glad that Aime Forand is here to see it finally passed and signed--one of the first authors.   There are more than 18 million Americans over the age of 65. Most of them have low incomes. Most of them are threatened by illness and medical expenses that they cannot afford.  And through this new law, Mr. President, every citizen will be able, in his productive years when he is earning, to insure himself against the ravages of illness in his old age.  This insurance will help pay for care in hospitals, in skilled nursing homes, or in the home. And under a separate plan it will help meet the fees of the doctors."    Q: Which party put a tax on Social Security?  A: The Democratic party.     FALSE  Actually, it was Ronald Reagan, a Republican, who signed a bill taxing Social Security benefits.  urlLink "The 1983 Amendments"   In the early 1980s the Social Security program faced a serious short-term financing crisis. President Reagan appointed a blue-ribbon panel, known as the Greenspan Commission, to study the financing issues and make recommendations for legislative changes. The final bill, signed into law in 1983, made numerous changes in the Social Security and Medicare programs, including the taxation of Social Security benefits, the first coverage of Federal employees under Social Security and an increase in the retirement age in the next century."   Q: Which party increased the tax on Social Security? A: The Democratic Party with Al Gore casting the deciding vote.  TRUE  Since the statement does not mention any specific bill that Al Gore cast the deciding vote, it led to an exhaustive search. As a Vice President, he could have exercised his constitutional powers to break a tie vote in the Senate.  I did find as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, the VP did cast a vote in the Senate to break a tie.

A: That's right, immigrants moved into this country at 65 and got SSI Social Security. The Democratic Party gave that to them although they never paid a dime into it.     FALSE   urlLink 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30   "Other Eligibility Provisions Citizenship and Residence"  The individual must reside within one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia and be a citizen or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence or permanently residing in the United States under color of law. Persons living outside the United States for an entire calendar month lose their eligibility for such a month." The SSI (Supplemental Security Income) and the automatic annual COLA (Cost of Living Adjustments) based on the Consumer Price Index were pushed, signed, and implemented during the Nixon administration. So immigrants first received SSI under the Republican administration of President Richard M. Nixon.  It was actually Bill Clinton that signed legislation barring immigrants from receiving SSI as part of The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. This changed the following year with the signing of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.   urlLink "SSI"   In the 1970s, SSA became responsible for a new program, Supplemental Security Income (SSI). In the original 1935 Social Security Act, programs were introduced for needy aged and blind individuals and, in 1950, needy disabled individuals were added. These three programs were known as the "adult categories" and were administered by State and local governments with partial Federal funding. Over the years, the State programs became more complex and inconsistent, with as many as 1,350 administrative agencies involved and payments varying more than 300% from State to State.  In 1969, President Nixon identified a need to reform these and related welfare programs to "bring reason, order, and purpose into a tangle of overlapping programs." In 1971, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, Elliot Richardson, proposed that SSA assume responsibility for the "adult categories." In the Social Security Amendments of 1972, Congress federalized the "adult categories" by creating the SSI program and assigned responsibility for it to SSA.  SSA was chosen to administer the new program because of its reputation for successful administration of the existing social insurance programs. SSA's nationwide network of field offices and large-scale data processing and record-keeping operations also made it the logical choice to perform the major task of converting over 3 million people from State welfare programs to SSI."   urlLink "The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of1996."   This "welfare reform" legislation, signed by the President on 8/22/96, ended the categorical entitlement to AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) that was part of the original 1935 Social Security Act by implementing time-limited benefits along with a work requirement. The law also terminated SSI eligibility for most non-citizens. Previously, lawfully admitted aliens could receive SSI if they met the other factors of entitlement. As of the date of enactment, no new non-citizens could be added to the benefit rolls and all existing non-citizen beneficiaries would eventually be removed from the rolls (unless they met one of the exceptions in the law.) Also effective upon enactment were provisions eliminating the "comparable severity standard" and reference to "maladaptive behavior" in the determination of disability for children to receive SSI. Also, children currently receiving benefits under the old standards were to be reviewed and removed from the rolls if they could not qualify under the new standards.   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997  This bill passed the House on 7/30/97 by a vote of 346 to 85, and passed the Senate the next day on a vote of 85 to 15. This law restored SSI eligibility to certain cohorts of non- citizens whose eligibility otherwise would be terminated under the "welfare reform" of 1996. It also extended for up to one year the period for redetermining the eligibility of certain aliens who may ultimately not be eligible for continued benefits."   These are the present requirements for SSI eligibility: urlLink "96.006 ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS   Applicant Eligibility: The eligibility of an individual who has attained age 65 or who is blind or disabled is determined on the basis of an assessment of the individual's monthly income and resources, citizenship or alien status, U.S. residency, and certain other eligibility requirements. In determining a month's income, the first $20 of Social Security or other unearned income is not counted. An additional $65 of earned income ($85 if the person had no unearned income) received in a month plus one-half of the remainder above $65 (or $85) also is not counted. If, after these (and other) exclusions, an individual's countable income, effective January 2002, is less than $545 per month ($817 for a couple, both of whom are aged, blind or disabled) and countable resources are less than $2,000 ($3,000 for a couple), the individual may be eligible for payments. The values of household goods, personal effects, an automobile, life insurance, and property needed for self support are, if within limits set out in regulations, excluded in determining value of resources. Burial spaces for an individual and immediate family and burial funds, up to $1,500 each for an individual and spouse, are excluded from resources. The value of a home which serves as the principal place of residence is also excluded in resource valuation.  Beneficiary Eligibility: Individuals who have attained age 65 or are blind or disabled, who continue to meet the income and resources tests, citizenship/qualified alien status, U.S. residence, and certain other requirements. Eligibility may continue for beneficiaries who engage in substantial gainful activity despite disabling physical or mental impairments.  Credentials/Documentation: Proof of age, marital status, income and resources, establishment of blindness or disability, proof of residence in the U.S. and citizenship, or alien status is required."  The implication is that if one did not pay much into the system, they should not be entitled to receive benefits beyond their contribution. Certainly, many of the retirees over the past couple of decades have received much more than they ever put in. A case in point is the first recipient of a monthly check.   urlLink click   "Ida May Fuller worked for three years under the Social Security program. The accumulated taxes on her salary during those three years was a total of $24.75. Her initial monthly check was $22.54. During her lifetime she collected a total of $22,888.92 in Social Security benefits."

						     Voting troubles may not be over in FL, elsewhere  By Larry Wheeler, Gannett News Service  WASHINGTON DC: The nation may never see another butterfly ballot or hanging chad from Florida, but the Sunshine State still hasn't fixed its voting system.   That could mean big trouble again if the Nov. 2 presidential election is as close as it was in 2000, as many anticipate it will be.   Two factors that made the 2000 vote recount so controversial - the confusing butterfly ballots and faulty punch-card voting systems - have been eliminated.    Fifteen of Florida's 67 counties now have new touch-screen voting machines. The rest will use optical scanning devices. Both methods are considered more reliable than the old punch-card system, but they aren't without problems.   A programming error in an optical scanning machine caused an erroneous result in Florida's presidential primary election earlier this year.   (AmericanGoddess' comment: BIG SURPRISE)  And touch-screen voting machines have come under fire because they can't produce a paper trail in case a recount is ordered. State and county officials are working on a temporary fix.   Civil rights groups in Florida also are concerned about a potential repeat of the 2000 election mess. They say the state's list of 48,000 ex-felons contains inaccuracies that could cause local election officials to wrongfully purge eligible voters.   "The right to vote is still at stake in Florida's elections," said Courtenay Strickland, coordinator for the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, dedicated to protecting and restoring voter rights.   Several lawsuits are pending in Florida seeking changes to protect voter rights, including one filed Wednesday that seeks to reverse a Division of Elections rule that excludes touch-screen ballots from manual recounts.   Florida is one of six states that does not automatically restore the voting rights of felons after they have served their sentences. Just before the 2000 election, Florida officials conducted a purge of voter rolls seeking to exclude convicted felons that caused confusion at the polls and prompted claims of discrimination and disenfranchisement.   Republican Gov. Jeb Bush and state election officials have dismissed criticism of the list as politically motivated.   (AmericanGoddess' Comment: BIG SURPRISE AGAIN)  A report by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights concluded Florida blacks were systematically denied the right to vote because of the felon list and other factors.   Some voters are taking steps this year to ensure that their vote is counted.   Laura Fuller, a freelance photographer in Palm Beach County, already has called the county's supervisor of elections to make sure her name is on the list of registered voters. And she plans to call again in September.   In 2000, Fuller, a member of the Green Party, was unable to cast a ballot because her name wasn't on her precinct's list of registered voters. She spent more than two hours dialing into the county's election office but couldn't get through.   She never learned why her name was left off the voting list.   "I was pretty ticked off," Fuller said.   Florida may not be the only trouble spot this fall. Across the country, election officials are dealing with a mounting list of problems.   * California's secretary of state restricted the use of new touch-screen voting machines after computer glitches were discovered.   * Voting machines in Maryland presented some voters with an incorrect list of  state primary candidates.   * Election officials in some counties in Iowa have resisted efforts to modernize antiquated voting machines because they don't see a need to change.   After the 2000 election, many states installed new touch-screen voting machines, replacing the old punch-card technology that proved so vexing in the Florida recount.   But about 11% of registered voters (16 million people) will cast ballots on the old punch-card machines this November, according to a Gannett News Service analysis of information from Election Data Services Inc., a political consulting firm in Washington.   "The 2004 election is in danger," said Kay Maxwell, president of the League of Women Voters. "Many of the problems we saw in the 2000 election still have not been fully solved."   President Bush and Democratic candidate John Kerry are tied in Florida, each pulling the support of 43% of registered voters in the most recent statewide poll by Quinnipiac University Polling Institute of Connecticut.

						    Here are some tips for making sure your vote gets counted Nov. 2.  ONE: Register to vote. Call your county election supervisor to find out how and when to register.  TWO: Confirm that you are registered to vote, which precinct you will vote in and the location of the polling place.  THREE: Bring photo identification with you to the polling place, along with a current utility bill or something else to show who you are and where you live.  FOUR: Vote between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. to avoid long lines. Know when polls close in your area.  FIVE: Obtain a sample ballot ahead of time to learn its format, view candidate names and make your selections.   SIX: If you have problems with the voting machine, step outside the booth and ask a poll worker for assistance.  SEVEN: If you know you can't get to the polling place on Election Day or simply don't want to go there, you can request an absentee ballot from your local election supervisor's office at least 30 days prior to Election Day.  EIGHT: Vote early. Many states allow voting before Election Day at central locations and through the mail.   Sources: League of Women Voters and Gannett News Service research.

						    My friend JG sent me this, preceded by his commentary:  JG's Comment: Funny how the R's are accusing the D's of disenfranchisement when Bush only won the election due to almost 45,000 African-Americans being denied voting rights in Florida....   GOP Admits It's Pushing Nader in Michigan   Democrats Ask Green Candidate to Reject Republican Assistance  By KATHY BARKS HOFFMAN, AP  LANSING, Mich. (July 8) - Michigan Republicans are helping gather signatures to place independent Ralph Nader on the presidential ballot in the battleground state, irritating Democrats who accuse the GOP of trying to pull votes away from candidate John Kerry.  "It's another example of state Republicans willing to try every unethical trick in the book to hold power," Democratic Executive Chairman Mark Brewer said Thursday. "This clearly shows that a vote for Ralph Nader is a vote to re-elect George Bush. The Republicans know that, and that's why they are desperate to have Nader on the Michigan ballot."  Greg McNeilly of the state Republican Party said the GOP is doing nothing wrong and hopes Nader will draw votes from the Democratic candidate. Republicans will make sure Nader has more than the 30,000 valid signatures he needs by July 15 to qualify for the Michigan ballot, McNeilly said.  "Unlike the Democratic Party, where 'D' stands for disenfranchisement, we want voters to have choices," he said.  Brewer sent a letter to Nader on Thursday asking that he refuse the GOP's assistance and any petition signatures collected by the Republican Party, its staff or volunteers.  "We're not out there focusing on getting Libertarians on the ballot," Brewer said. "If the Republicans refuse to stop their efforts and Nader accepts their help, we will have no choice but to oppose his petition effort, review every signature and challenge his petitions if they are insufficient in any way."      When Nader was denied a spot on the Arizona ballot last week, he accused the Democrats and Kerry of engaging in political "dirty tricks" by challenging his ballot access.  Voters are far more focused on the presidential election now than they were at this time in the 2000 campaign, says a poll released Thursday.  Nearly six in 10 voters, 58 percent, say they are giving quite a lot of thought to the election, compared with just under half who felt that way in June 2000, according to the poll by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press.  Almost two-thirds, 63 percent, said it really matters who wins the presidential election, compared with 45 percent who felt that way in June 2000.  The poll of 1,426 registered voters was taken June 3-13 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Sen. John Kerry's plans to host a Boston Pops concert on the city's Esplanade during the Democratic National Convention were rejected Thursday by officials from Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney's administration who refused to issue a permit because of logistical and security concerns.  Katherine Abbott, commissioner of the state Department of Conservation and Recreation, decided against granting the permit for the July 28 concert and fireworks show after state Public Safety Secretary Ed Flynn advised against it. In a letter to Abbott, Flynn said that with the convention three weeks away, there was not enough time "to properly develop a sound plan for public safety and security."  Kerry, the four-term Massachusetts senator, had planned the event to show appreciation to his hometown for hosting the convention, at which he'll accept the Democratic nomination for president. Jack Corrigan, Kerry's convention liaison, had no comment.   Flynn was appointed by Romney, a Republican who chairs the Bush-Cheney campaign in Massachusetts. Flynn said that the recommendation was not motivated by politics.  An Internet site that Indiana businessman Kerry Edwards started two years ago has become hot property.  Edwards, 34, of Indianapolis, started his kerryedwards.com Web site two years ago to show off photos of his toddler son. But interest in the site boomed Tuesday after Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry named John Edwards as his running mate.  Calls have been coming into Kerry Edwards' bail bonds business from people asking to take over the site. One of the first inquiries came from John Kerry's campaign, who asked if the Indianapolis man would donate the domain name.  Kerry Edwards, who pays about $25 a year for the domain, says he won't give up the Web site for free and has received offers of up to $30,000 for the name.  He says he will probably place the domain name for sale on eBay. "I'll sell it if the price is right, that's for sure," he said.  Some congressional Democrats are asking the United Nations to monitor the U.S. presidential election, saying they want to prevent a repeat of voting rights violations reported in the 2000 Florida recount.  The group, led by Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, said they want U.N Secretary-General Kofi Annan to deploy election observers to the state.  "African-Americans, women and other U.S. citizens have fought too hard and too long for us to allow our votes not to be counted. We have to instill some trust and accountability back in the process," Johnson said.     The Florida recount helped President Bush win the 2000 election. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights later found that the ballots of black voters in the state were disproportionately tossed out and the election was plagued by faulty machinery, among other problems.  The United Nations received a letter from members of Congress and has not replied, said U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe. She said the United Nations responds to requests from national governments, though not specifically from legislative bodies.  All requests for electoral assistance also require approval from the U.N. General Assembly, she said.  Several of the members who signed the letter to Annan belong to the Congressional Black Caucus.  Besides Johnson, the letter also was signed by Reps. Corrine Brown of Florida; Julia Carson of Indiana; William Lacy Clay of Missouri; Joseph Crowley, Carolyn Maloney, Jerrold Nadler and Edolphus Towns of New York, Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who is president of the black caucus; Danny Davis of Illinois; Raul Grijalva of Arizona and Michael Honda and Barbara Lee of California.

						    Sat Jul 10, 6:25 AM ET     By KATHERINE PFLEGER SHRADER, Associated Press Writer   WASHINGTON - Following the release of a Senate report harshly criticizing U.S. intelligence gathering and analysis, the focus will soon shift to whether and how to make sweeping changes to the intelligence community.   After a yearlong investigation, the Senate Intelligence Committee released nearly 120 conclusions about the intelligence community's performance on estimating the threat from Iraq (news - web sites), found primarily in a 2002 assessment that served as the Bush administration's leading arguments for war.   Following release of the 511-page review Friday, the panel's top Democrat, West Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller, said three-quarters of senators would not have voted to authorize the invasion if they had known how weak the intelligence was.   "This report cries out for reform," said committee chairman Pat Roberts, R-Kan.   In the unanimously approved report, senators concluded that the CIA kept key information from its own and other agencies' analysts; engaged in "group think" by failing to challenge the assumption that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction; and allowed President Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell to make false statements.   "Most, if not all, of these problems stem from a broken corporate culture and poor management," which won't be fixed simply by giving the agency more money or people, the report said.   Among much-discussed reform proposals, some have suggested centralizing the intelligence community under a Cabinet-level Director of National Intelligence who would oversee the roughly $40 billion budget of the 15-agency intelligence apparatus. Currently, the CIA director also oversees the intelligence community, but he doesn't control the vast majority of the money.   Deputy Central Intelligence Director John McLaughlin, who said the CIA and other agencies are adapting and making internal reforms, urged caution against disruptions while the nation is in the middle of the anti-terror fight. "Some sort of reordering of the boxes here will not bring you perfection in the intelligence business," he said.   But politics may play more of a role in reforms than anything else. Few believe significant changes will happen before the November election.   The report was yet another blow to the credibility of the Bush administration and U.S. intelligence agencies. The committee concluded that key assertions used to justify the Iraq war — that Saddam Hussein had chemical and biological weapons and was working to build nuclear weapons — were either wrong or overblown.   Bush called the report a useful accounting of intelligence agencies' shortcomings. He defended the decision to go to war, however, as well as his prewar assertions about Saddam's government and weapons of mass destruction.   "We haven't found the stockpiles, but we knew he could make them," the president said. "The world is better off without Saddam Hussein in power."    (AmericanGoddess' note: HE EVEN ADMITS IT!!!!!!!!!!!)   Although senators from both parties agreed in harshly criticizing the CIA, Democrats and Republicans clashed over whether administration officials had pressured intelligence analysts to reach predetermined conclusions on the Iraq threat. Democrats said there was pressure; Republicans said there were tough questions but no inappropriate influence.   Democrats also said the investigation should have examined whether the White House had twisted the intelligence it received — a second phase of the probe that probably won't be finished until after the elections.   "The fact is that when it comes to national security, the buck stops at the White House, not anywhere else," said Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry.   The report comes as Bush looks for a new leader for the intelligence community. CIA Director George Tenet has resigned, effective Sunday, and McLaughlin will take over as a temporary replacement. But the report's across-the-board criticism of the CIA could indicate that any nominee from within the intelligence community would have a tough time winning confirmation by the Senate.   McLaughlin said the CIA is learning from its mistakes and has already made changes, including adding reviews from a "devil's advocate" perspective to all future national intelligence estimates.   "We get it," McLaughlin said at a rare news conference at CIA headquarters. "Although we think the judgments were not unreasonable when they were made nearly two years ago, we understand with all we have learned since then that we could have done better."   Among conclusions in the report:   1: Most major judgments in the October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate about Iraq's alleged nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs were "either overstated or were not supported by the underlying intelligence reporting."   2: Intelligence officials didn't explain to policy-makers the uncertainties behind their judgments.   3: Intelligence agencies suffered from a collective presumption that Iraq had an active and growing program to develop weapons of mass destruction.   4: The United States depended too heavily on defectors and foreign governments' intelligence.   ~~ ** ~~ ** ~~ ** ~~ ** ~~  On the Net:   The report is available  urlLink here

						     Federal Statutes On Asset Forfeiture May Not Be Published   In another move towards federal tyranny, the Attorney General John Ashcroft has ordered the American Library Association to destroy all copies of the federal laws on asset forfeiture and to deny access to those laws to the general public.   The unprecedented move, in which US citizens would be unable to read or know the text of the laws they are expected to obey, was another stage in the growing power of President George W Bush.   The American Library Association has refused the request of the "Justice" Department to destroy copies of the law, and made the following statement:   Statement regarding DOJ request for removal of government publications by depository libraries   The following statement has been issued by President-Elect Michael Gorman, representing President Carol Brey-Casiano, who is currently in Guatemala representing the Association:   July 30, 2004   Statement from ALA President-Elect Michael Gorman:   Last week, the American Library Association learned that the Department of Justice asked the Government Printing Office Superintendent of Documents to instruct depository libraries to destroy five publications the Department has deemed not "appropriate for external use." The Department of Justice has called for these five these public documents, two of which are texts of federal statutes, to be removed from depository libraries and destroyed, making their content available only to those with access to a law office or law library.   The topics addressed in the named documents include information on how citizens can retrieve items that may have been confiscated by the government during an investigation.   The documents to be removed and destroyed include: Civil and Criminal Forfeiture Procedure; Select Criminal Forfeiture Forms; Select Federal Asset Forfeiture Statutes; Asset forfeiture and money laundering resource directory; and Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 (CAFRA).   ALA has submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for the withdrawn materials in order to obtain an official response from the Department of Justice regarding this unusual action, and why the Department has requested that documents that have been available to the public for as long as four years be removed from depository library collections. ALA is committed to ensuring that public documents remain available to the public and will do its best to bring about a satisfactory resolution of this matter.   Librarians should note that, according to policy 72, written authorization from the Superintendent of Documents is required to remove any documents. To this date no such written authorization in hard copy has been issued.   Keith Michael Fiels  Executive Director  American Library Association  (800) 545-2433 ext.1392

						    How George W. Bush became the head of the new American Dominionist Church/State   By Katherine Yurica With Editorial and Research Assistant Laurie Hall February 11, 2004   The First Prince of the Theocratic States of America    It happened quietly, with barely a mention in the media. Only the Washington Post dutifully reported it.[1] And only Kevin Phillips saw its significance in his new book, American Dynasty.[2] On December 24, 2001, Pat Robertson resigned his position as President of the Christian Coalition.  Behind the scenes religious conservatives were abuzz with excitement. They believed Robertson had stepped down to allow the ascendance of the President of the United States of America to take his rightful place as the head of the true American Holy Christian Church.  Robertson’s act was symbolic, but it carried a secret and solemn revelation to the faithful. It was the signal that the Bush administration was a government under God that was led by an anointed President who would be the first regent in a dynasty of regents awaiting the return of Jesus to earth. The President would now be the minister through whom God would execute His will in the nation. George W. Bush accepted his scepter and his sword with humility, grace and a sense of exultation.  As Antonin Scalia, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court explained a few months later, the Bible teaches and Christians believe “… that government …derives its moral authority from God. Government is the ‘minister of God’ with powers to ‘revenge,’ to ‘execute wrath,’ including even wrath by the sword…”[3]  George W. Bush began to wield the sword of God’s revenge with relish from the beginning of his administration, but most of us missed the sword play. I have taken the liberty to paraphrase an illustration from Leo Strauss, the father of the neo-conservative movement, which gives us a clue of how the hiding is done:  “One ought not to say to those whom one wants to kill, ‘Give me your votes, because your votes will enable me to kill you and I want to kill you,’ but merely, ‘Give me your votes,’ for once you have the power of the votes in your hand, you can satisfy your desire.”[4]  Notwithstanding the advice, the President’s foreign policy revealed a flair for saber rattling. He warned the world that “nations are either with us or they’re against us!” His speeches, often containing allusions to biblical passages, were spoken with the certainty of a man who holds the authority of God’s wrath on earth, for he not only challenged the evil nations of the world, singling out Iraq, Syria, Iran, and North Korea as the “axis of evil,” but he wielded the sword of punishment and the sword of revenge against his own people: the American poor and the middle class who according to the religious right have earned God’s wrath by their licentiousness and undisciplined lives.  To the middle class he said, “I’m going to give you clear skies clean air and clean water,” then he gutted the environmental controls that were designed to provide clean air and water. The estimated number of premature deaths that will result: 100,000.[5] He said to the poor and to the middle class: “I’m going to give you a prescription drug program, one that you truly deserve.” Then he gave the drug industry an estimated $139 billion dollars in increased profits from the Medicare funds and arranged for the poorest of seniors to be eliminated from coverage, while most elderly will pay more for drugs than they paid before his drug benefit bill passed.[6] After that he arranged for the dismantling of the Medicare program entirely, based on the method outlined by his religious mentors.[7] He said to the people of America, “I’m going to build a future for you and your children,” then he gutted their future with tax breaks to the rich and a pre-emptive war against Iraq, and the largest spending deficit in history.[8]  This article is the documented story of how a political religious movement called Dominionism gained control of the Republican Party, then took over Congress, then took over the White House, and now is sealing the conversion of America to a theocracy by taking over the American Judiciary.  It’s the story of why and how “the wrath of God Almighty” will be unleashed against the middle class, against the poor, and against the elderly and sick of this nation by George W. Bush and his army of Republican Dominionist “rulers.”    How Dominionism Was Spread    The years 1982-1986 marked the period Pat Robertson and radio and televangelists urgently broadcast appeals that rallied Christian followers to accept a new political religion that would turn millions of Christians into an army of political operatives. It was the period when the militant church raised itself from centuries of sleep and once again eyed power.  At the time, most Americans were completely unaware of the militant agenda being preached on a daily basis across the breadth and width of America. Although it was called “Christianity” it can barely be recognized as Christian. It in fact was and is a wolf parading in sheep’s clothing: It was and is a political scheme to take over the government of the United States and then turn that government into an aggressor nation that will forcibly establish the United States as the ruling empire of the twenty-first century. It is subversive, seditious, secretive, and dangerous.[9]  Dominionism is a natural if unintended extension of Social Darwinism and is frequently called “Christian Reconstructionism.” Its doctrines are shocking to ordinary Christian believers and to most Americans. Journalist Frederick Clarkson, who has written extensively on the subject, warned in 1994 that Dominionism “seeks to replace democracy with a theocratic elite that would govern by imposing their interpretation of ‘Biblical Law.’” He described the ulterior motive of Dominionism is to eliminate “…labor unions, civil rights laws, and public schools.” Clarkson then describes the creation of new classes of citizens:  “Women would be generally relegated to hearth and home. Insufficiently Christian men would be denied citizenship, perhaps executed. So severe is this theocracy that it would extend capital punishment [to] blasphemy, heresy, adultery, and homosexuality.”[10]  Today, Dominionists hide their agenda and have resorted to stealth; one investigator who has engaged in internet exchanges with people who identify themselves as religious conservatives said, “They cut and run if I mention the word ‘Dominionism.’”[11]  Joan Bokaer, the Director of Theocracy Watch, a project of the Center for Religion, Ethics and Social Policy at Cornell University wrote, “In March 1986, I was on a speaking tour in Iowa and received a copy of the following memo [Pat] Robertson had distributed to the Iowa Republican County Caucus titled, “How to Participate in a Political Party.” It read:  “Rule the world for God.  “Give the impression that you are there to work for the party, not push an ideology.  “Hide your strength.  “Don’t flaunt your Christianity.  “Christians need to take leadership positions. Party officers control political parties and so it is very important that mature Christians have a majority of leadership positions whenever possible, God willing.”[12]  Dominionists have gained extensive control of the Republican Party and the apparatus of government throughout the United States; they continue to operate secretly. Their agenda to undermine all government social programs that assist the poor, the sick, and the elderly is ingeniously disguised under false labels that confuse voters. Nevertheless, as we shall see, Dominionism maintains the necessity of laissez-faire economics, requiring that people “look to God and not to government for help.”[13]  It is estimated that thirty-five million Americans who call themselves Christian, adhere to Dominionism in the United States, but most of these people appear to be ignorant of the heretical nature of their beliefs and the seditious nature of their political goals. So successfully have the televangelists and churches inculcated the idea of the existence of an outside “enemy,” which is attacking Christianity, that millions of people have perceived themselves rightfully overthrowing an imaginary evil anti-Christian conspiratorial secular society.  When one examines the progress of its agenda, one sees that Dominionism has met its time table: the complete takeover of the American government was predicted to occur by 2004.[14] Unless the American people reject the GOP’s control of the government, Americans may find themselves living in a theocracy that has already spelled out its intentions to change every aspect of American life including its cultural life, its Constitution and its laws.  Born in Christian Reconstructionism, which was founded by the late R. J. Rushdoony, the framers of the new cult included Rushdoony, his son-in-law Gary North, Pat Robertson, Herb Titus, the former Dean of Robertson’s Regent University School of Public Policy (formerly CBN University), Charles Colson, Robertson’s political strategist, Tim LaHaye, Gary Bauer, the late Francis Schaeffer, and Paul Crouch, the founder of TBN, the world’s largest television network, plus a virtual army of likeminded television and radio evangelists and news talk show hosts.  Dominionism started with the Gospels and turned the concept of the invisible and spiritual “Kingdom of God” into a literal political empire that could be taken by force, starting with the United States of America. Discarding the original message of Jesus and forgetting that Jesus said, “My kingdom is not of this world,” the framers of Dominionism boldly presented a Gospel whose purpose was to inspire Christians to enter politics and execute world domination so that Jesus could return to an earth prepared for his earthly rule by his faithful “regents.”   How Machiavellianism, Communism, Secular Humanism and Neo-Conservatism Inspired a New Militant and Evil Anti-Christian Religion   In the fifties and sixties, right-wing Christians worried about communists and communism taking over the world. Along with communism, another enemy to Christianity was identified by ministers. In 1982, Francis Schaeffer, who was then the leading evangelical theologian, called Secular Humanism the greatest threat to Christianity the world had ever seen. Soon American fundamentalists and Pentecostals were seeing “humanists” everywhere. Appearing on Pat Robertson’s 700 Club show, Schaeffer claimed that humanism was being forced on Christians; it taught that man was the “center of all things.” Like communism, secular humanism was based on atheism, which was sufficient enough for Schaeffer to conclude that humanism was an enemy to the Kingdom of God.[15]  “The enemy is this other view of reality,” Schaeffer spoke emotionally. Citing the Declaration of Independence as his authorizing document, he said:  “Today we live in a humanist society. They control the schools. They control public television. They control the media in general. And what we have to say is we live in a humanist society….[Because] the courts are not subject to the will of the people through elections or re-election… all the great changes in the last forty years have come through the courts. And what we must get in our mind is the government as a whole, but especially the courts, has become the vehicle to force this view on the total population, even if the total population doesn’t hold the view.”[16]  Schaeffer claimed that the major “titanic changes” to America occurred since 1942:  “If you don’t revolt against tyranny and this is what I call the bottom line, is that not only do you have the privilege but [you have] the duty to revolt. When people force upon you and society that which is absolutely contrary to the Word of God, and which really is tyranny…we have a right to stand against it as a matter of principle. And this was the basis upon which the founding fathers built this country.”  The appeal to evangelicals went further. On April 29, 1985, Billy Graham, the respected and world famous evangelist, told Pat Robertson’s audience on the 700 Club show that:  “[T]he time has come when evangelicals are going to have to think about getting organized corporately….I’m for evangelicals running for public office and winning if possible and getting control of the Congress, getting control of the bureaucracy, getting control of the executive branch of government. I think if we leave it to the other side we’re going to be lost. I would like to see every true believer involved in politics in some way shape or form.”  According to Schaeffer, Robertson, and Billy Graham, then arguably the three most famous and influential leaders in the American protestant church world, “God’s people” had a moral duty to change the government of the United States.[17]  Significantly, at the time, many other fundamentalist ministers were identifying communism and secular humanism as religions. However, the equating of a political ideology on the one hand, and a philosophy that rejects supernaturalism on the other hand, with religions was not accidental.[18] It allowed the preachers to revile an economic-political system as well as a philosophy as false religions, even demonic religions, which Christians should reject at any cost.[19]  Underneath the pejoratives, however, there was a grudging admiration on the part of Pat Robertson and the other politically astute Dominionists, for they saw that a political agenda that wrapped itself in religious robes had the innate power to explode exponentially into the most politically dynamic movement in American and world history.  The result of the new religion was that by the year 2000, thirty-five million Americans would declare war on the remaining 245 million. Karl Rove, President Bush’s political advisor, told the Family Research Council in 2002, “We need to find ways to win the war.”[20] One is tempted to respond, “Wait a minute, they’re in power so why do they need to continue the war?”  That is the salient question. The answer is frightening.   Starting with a simple idea, Robertson perceived the enormous advantage of placing an otherwise unacceptable political theory into a religious context. By doing so it would stand Christianity up-side-down and end American democracy.   A Machiavellian Religion Was Born   American Christianity had already seen extremes. For Dominionists, perhaps the single most important event in the last half of the twentieth century occurred when the Reverend Jim Jones proved that the religious would follow their leader to Guyana and even further, to their deaths. That fact could hardly have escaped the notice of even the dullest of politically minded preachers.  Indeed, Jim Jones’ surreal power over his congregants leaps out from the grave even today. If a man desired to change the laws in America—to undo Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal for instance, and allow corporations the unbridled freedom they enjoyed prior to the Great Depression (which included the freedom to defraud, pillage, and to destroy the land with impunity on the way to gathering great fortunes), what better way to proceed than to cloak the corruption within a religion? If a few men wanted to establish an American empire and control the entire world, what better vehicle to carry them to their goal than to place their agenda within the context of a religion? Jim Jones proved religious people would support even immoral political deeds if their leaders found a way to frame those deeds as “God’s Will.” The idea was brilliant. Its framers knew they could glorify greed, hate, nationalism and even a Christian empire with ease.[21]  The religion the canny thinkers founded follows the reverse of communism and secular humanism, it poured political and economic ideology into a religion and that combustible mixture produced “Dominionism,” a new political faith that had the additional advantage of insulating the cult from attacks on its political agenda by giving its practitioners the covering to simply cry out, “You’re attacking me for my religious beliefs and that’s religious persecution!”[22]  But how could a leader get away with a religious fraud that barely hides its destructive and false intent?  Jim Jones’s history holds the answer. He not only proved the obvious fact that people are blinded by their religious beliefs and will only impute goodness, mercy, and religious motivations to their leader, but Jim Jones proved the efficacy of the basic teaching of Machiavelli: a leader must only appear to have the qualities of goodness—he need not actually possess those attributes.  In fact, Machiavelli taught that it is dangerous for a leader to practice goodness. Instead, he must pretend to be good and then do the opposite. Machiavelli taught that a leader will succeed on appearances alone. A good leader puts his finger to the wind and changes course whenever it is expedient to do so. Machiavelli wrote this revealing passage that could be applied not only to false religious leaders but to a false President:     “Alexander VI did nothing else but deceive men, he thought of nothing else, and found the occasion for it; no man was ever more able to give assurances, or affirmed things with stronger oaths, and no man observed them less; however, he always succeeded in his deceptions, as he well knew this aspect of things.”  “Everybody sees what you appear to be, few feel what you are, and those few will not dare to oppose themselves to the many, who have the majesty of the state to defend them; and in the actions of men, and especially of princes, from which there is no appeal, the end justifies the means.” (p. 93)  Chillingly Machiavelli advises his readers:  “Let a prince therefore aim at conquering and maintaining the state, and the means will always be judged honourable and praised by every one, for the vulgar is always taken by appearances and the issue of the event; and the world consists only of the vulgar, and the few who are not vulgar are isolated when the many have a rallying point in the prince.” (p. 94)  Machiavelli also wrote how to govern dominions that previous to being occupied lived under their own laws. His words eerily reflect the Bush Administration’s decisions on how to rule Iraq:  “When those states which have been acquired are accustomed to live at liberty under their own laws, there are three ways of holding them. The first is to despoil them;[23] the second is to go and live there in person; the third is to allow them to live under their own laws, taking tribute of them, and creating within the country a government composed of a few who will keep it friendly to you. Because this government, being created by the prince, knows that it cannot exist without his friendship and protection, and will do all it can to keep them. What is more, a city used to liberty can be more easily held by means of its citizens than in any other way, if you wish to preserve it.” (p. 46)  However Machiavelli has second thoughts and follows with this caveat:  “…. [I]n truth there is no sure method of holding them except by despoiling them. And whoever becomes the ruler of a free city and does not destroy it, can expect to be destroyed by it, for it can always find a motive for rebellion in the name of liberty and of its ancient usages…”[24] (p. 46)  (The above quotes are from The Prince in the original Oxford University Press translation by Luigi Ricci, 1903; revised by E. R. P. Vincent, 1935)  Machiavelli’s books, The Prince and The Discourses are not abstract treatises. Christian Gauss, who wrote an important introduction to the Oxford edition, called them by their rightful name: they are in fact a “concise manual—a handbook of those who would acquire or increase their political power.” Gauss tells us that a long line of kings and ministers and tyrants studied Machiavelli, including Mussolini, Hitler, Lenin and Stalin.     How Can Evil Deeds Be Reconciled With Christian Beliefs?   It’s important to understand that the founders of Dominionism are sitting on the horns of a moral dilemma: How can a leader be both good and evil at the same time? For if biblical moral proscriptions are applicable to him, he will certainly suffer some form of censure. And if proscriptions are applicable, the leader could not lie to the citizenry with impunity or do evil so that “good” could be achieved. The answer to the dilemma of how a Dominionist leader could both do evil and still maintain his place of honor in the Christian community lies in the acceptance and adoption of the Calvinistic doctrine that James Hogg wrote about in The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner.  (W.W. Norton, N.Y. 1970.)  This novel, published in 1824, is concerned with psychological aberration and as such, anticipates the literature of the twentieth century. The protagonist is a young man named Robert, who drenched in the religious bigotry of Calvinism, concluded that he was predestined before the beginning of the world to enter heaven, therefore no sin he committed would be held to his account. This freed Robert to become an assassin in the cause of Christ and His Church.  Fifty years ago a variation on the concept was expressed disapprovingly as, “Once saved—always saved.” In this view, salvation had nothing to do with “good works or a holy life.” A drunk who had a born again experience would be among God’s chosen elect whether he stopped drinking or not. But the logical extension of the reasoning is the idea that Christianity could have within itself not ex-sinners but active sinners: as Christian murderers, Christian pedophiles, Christian rapists, Christian thieves, Christian arsonists, and every other kind of socio-pathological behavior possible. As we have sadly witnessed of late the concept is broadly accepted within the American churches.  But the Dominionists needed the aberrant extension of Calvinism; they believe as did Calvin and John Knox that before the creation of the universe, all men were indeed predestined to be either among God’s elect or were unregenerate outcasts. And it is at this point Dominionists introduced a perversion to Calvinism—the same one James Hogg utilizes in his The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner—its technical name is “supralapsarianism.” It means essentially that the man called from before the foundation of the world to be one of the elect of God’s people, can do no wrong. No wonder then observers noted a definite religious swing in George W. Bush from Wesleyan theology to Calvinism early in his administration.[25]  How comforting the Calvinistic idea of a “justified sinner” is when one is utilizing Machiavellian techniques to gain political control of a state. It’s more than comforting; it is a required doctrine for “Christians” who believe they must use evil to bring about good. It justifies lying, murder, fraud and all other criminal acts without the fuss of having to deal with guilt feelings or to feel remorse for the lives lost through executions, military actions, or assassinations.  If this doctrine seems too wayward to believe as it might have done had I not heard a recent interview with a Pentecostal minister—rest assured the twisted doctrine is horribly alive and thriving in America today.  The interview conducted by Brian Copeland a news talk show host for KGO, San Francisco on September 5, 2003, was with the Reverend Donald Spitz of Pensacola, Florida who is involved with a Pro Life group in Virginia and with the Army of God. The occasion was the execution of Paul Hill, another Pentecostal minister who murdered a doctor and his body guard outside an abortion clinic. Hill was caught and convicted of the crimes. Spitz admitted that he was Paul Hill’s spiritual counselor. He said Hill died with the conviction he had done the Lord’s work. Spitz who approved of the murder said, “Someone else is going to handle the publishing of Paul Hill’s book On How to Assassinate.”  Spitz believed that Hill was completely justified in murdering the physician because, according to him, “twenty-six babies’ lives were saved by the killing.”  When Copeland pointed out that the scheduled abortions for the morning of the murders would have simply been postponed to another day—and that the lives of the fetuses were only extended for a day or so, Spitz refused to accept the argument.  Not surprisingly, Spitz opposed the use of birth control methods. Copeland asked, “If a woman is raped should she be forced to carry the fetus to term?” Spitz said, “Yes.”   “What if the pregnancy will kill the mother?” Spitz replied that under no circumstances could “the baby be killed.” When Spitz was asked, “Why haven’t you gone out and killed an abortionist?” he replied calmly, “God hasn’t told me to do the killing.”   The Neo-Conservative Connection with Dominionists and Machiavelli   I suspect that most Americans have never heard of Machiavelli, nevertheless, it should be no surprise to us that Machiavelli has been accepted, praised, and followed by the Neo-Conservatives in the White House and his precepts are blindly adopted by the so-called “Christian” Dominionists. Kevin Phillips tells us in his masterful book, American Dynasty that Karl Rove, political strategist for President George W. Bush, is a devotee of Machiavelli, just as Rove’s predecessor, Lee Atwater had been for the elder Bush.[26] In fact, there has been an incredible effort to dilute the immoral implications of Machiavelli’s teachings. Today’s best apologist for Machiavelli is one of the most influential voices in Washington with direct connections into the oval office.  Michael A. Ledeen was a Senior Fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a counselor to the National Security Council and special counselor to former Secretary of State, Alexander Haig in 1985. His relationship with Pat Robertson goes back at least to the early 1980’s.[27]  Like Robertson, Ledeen was an advocate for military intervention in Nicaragua and for assistance to the Contras. (Ledeen was also involved in the Iran-Contra affair.)[28]  Today, in 2004, Michael Ledeen is a fellow at the conservative think tank, the American Enterprise Institute and according to William O. Beeman of the Pacific News Service, “Ledeen has become the driving philosophical force behind the neoconservative movement and the military actions it has spawned.”[29]  Ledeen made a number of appearances on the 700 Club show during the 1980’s. Always presented as a distinguished guest, Robertson interviewed him on April 30, 1985 and asked him on this occasion: “What would you recommend if you were going to advise the President [Ronald Reagan] as to foreign policy?”  Ledeen responded:  “The United States has to make clear to the world and above all to its own citizens, what our vital interests are. And then we must make it clear to everyone that we are prepared to fight and fight fiercely to defend those interests, so that people will not cross the lines that are likely to kick off a trip wire.” (Emphasis added.)  If Ledeen’s advice sounds ruthless and Machiavellian—it may be because it is Machiavellian. (By definition his statement presupposes the existence of something or several things that are life threatening to the nation by the use of the word “vital.” Yet Ledeen asserts that which is life threatening must be made manifest or defined. If an interest must be defined, then it is not apparent; yet the nation will nevertheless ask its sons and daughters to fight and die for something that is not apparent. Therefore, whatever “interests” Ledeen wanted to be defined, cannot have been vital interests, which are apparent—so in reality he advised the President to call discretionary interests vital—which is a lie.)  Be aware that Ledeen is in complete accord with Machiavellian thinking. And so is Pat Robertson.[30] Robertson agreed to virtually every nuance Ledeen presented. In fact, it’s not clear which of the two first proposed invading Syria, Iran and Iraq back in the 1980’s,[31] a refrain that also echoed in the reports of the Project for the New American Century (PNAC), one of the major homes for neo-conservatives in 2000. Both Ledeen and Robertson targeted the same nations that PNAC lists as America’s greatest enemies in its paper, “Rebuilding America’s Defenses” (published in September 2000.)[32]  In 1999, Ledeen published his book, Machiavelli on Modern Leadership: Why Machiavelli’s Iron Rules Are as Timely and Important Today as Five Centuries Ago. (Truman Talley Books, St. Martin’s Griffin, N.Y. 1999.) Here is a sample of how Ledeen smoothes rough edges and presents a modern Machiavelli:  “In order to achieve the most noble accomplishments, the leader may have to ‘enter into evil.’ This is the chilling insight that has made Machiavelli so feared, admired, and challenging. It is why we are drawn to him still…” (p. 91)  Again, Ledeen writes:  “Just as the quest for peace at any price invites war and, worse than war, defeat and domination, so good acts sometimes advance the triumph of evil, as there are circumstances when only doing evil ensures the victory of a good cause.” (p. 93)  Ledeen clearly believes “the end justifies the means,” but not all the time. He writes “Lying is evil,” but then contradictorily argues that it produced  “a magnificent result,” and “is essential to the survival of nations and to the success of great enterprises.” (p. 95)  Ledeen adds this tidbit:  “All’s fair in war . . . and in love. Practicing deceit to fulfill your heart’s desire might be not only legitimate, but delicious!” (p. 95)  William O. Beeman tells us about Michael Ledeen’s influence. Writing for the Pacific News Service he says:   “Ledeen’s ideas are repeated daily by such figures as Richard Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz…He basically believes that violence in the service of the spread of democracy is America’s manifest destiny. Consequently, he has become the philosophical legitimator of the American occupation of Iraq.”[33]  In fact, Ledeen’s influence goes even further. The BBC, the Washington Post and Jim Lobe writing for the Asia Times report that Michael Ledeen is the only full-time international affairs analyst consulted by Karl Rove.[34] Ledeen has regular conversations with Rove. The Washington Post said, “More than once, Ledeen has seen his ideas faxed to Rove, become official policy or rhetoric.”[35]   Leo Strauss the Father of Neo-Conservatism   Leo Strauss was born in 1899 and died in 1973. He was a Jewish scholar who fled Germany when Hitler gained power. He eventually found refuge in the United States where he taught political science at the University of Chicago. He is most famous for resuscitating Machiavelli and introducing his principles as the guiding philosophy of the neo-conservative movement. Strauss has been called the godfather of Newt Gingrich’s “Contract with America.” More than any other man, Strauss breathed upon conservatism, inspiring it to rise from its atrophied condition and its natural dislike of change and to embrace an unbounded new political ideology that rides on the back of a revolutionary steed, hailing even radical change; hence the name Neo-Conservatives.  The father of neo-conservatism had many “spiritual” children at the University of Chicago, among them: Paul Wolfowitz and Abram Shulsky, who received their doctorates under Strauss in 1972. Harry V. Jaffa was a student of Strauss and has an important connection to Dominionists like Pat Robertson as we shall see below. However, Strauss’s family of influence extended beyond his students to include faculty members in universities, and the people his students taught. Those prominent neo-conservatives who are most notable are: Justice Clarence Thomas, Robert Bork, Irving Kristol and his son William Kristol, Alan Keyes, William J. Bennett, J. Danforth Quayle, Allan Bloom, John Podhoertz, John T. Agresto, John Ashcroft, Newt Gingrich, Gary Bauer, Michael Ledeen and scores of others, many of whom hold important positions in George W. Bush’s White House and Defense Department.  To understand the Straussian infusion of power that transformed an all but dead conservative realm, think of Nietzsche’s Overman come to life. Or better yet, think of the philosophy most unlike Christianity: Think of pure unmitigated evil. Strauss admits that Machiavelli is an evil man. But according to Strauss, this admission is a prerequisite to studying and reading Machiavelli: the acknowledgement is the safety net that keeps the reader from being corrupted. One is tempted to talk back to Strauss and point out an alternative: the admission could be the subterfuge that keeps a man from being ridiculed and rejected for espousing Machiavellian methods.  In one of the most important books for our times, Shadia Drury’s Leo Strauss and the American Right, undertakes to explain the ideas behind Strauss’s huge influence and following. Strauss’s reputation, according to Drury, rests in large part on his view that “a real philosopher must communicate quietly, subtly, and secretly to the few who are fit to receive his message.” Strauss claims secrecy is necessary to avoid “persecution.”[36]  In reading Strauss, one sometimes encounters coded contradictory ideas. For example, Strauss appears to respect Machiavelli because—as he points out—in contrast to other evil men, Machiavelli openly proclaimed opinions that others only secretly expressed behind closed doors. But we have just noted that Strauss teaches that secrecy is essential to the real philosopher. Strauss concluded, some would say that Machiavelli was after all, a patriot of sorts for he loved Italy more than he loved his own soul. Then Strauss warns, but if you call him a patriot, you “merely obscure something truly evil.”[37] So Strauss dances his way through the Machiavellian field of evil, his steps choreographed with duplicity and it’s opposite. The reader cannot let go.  In Strauss’s view, Machiavelli sees that Christianity “has led the world into weakness,” which can only be offset by returning the world to the ancient practices of the past. (Implied is not a return to the pagan past, but rather a return to the more virulent world of the Old Testament). Strauss laments, “Machiavelli needed …a detailed discussion revealing the harmony between his political teaching and the teaching of the Bible.” [38]These statements of Strauss, by themselves, were sufficient to send neo-conservative Christians to search for correlations between Machiavellianism, radical conservatism and the scriptures.[39]  Strauss’s teaching incorporated much of Machiavelli’s. Significantly, his philosophy is unfriendly to democracy—even antagonistic.  At the same time Strauss upheld the necessity for a national religion not because he favored religious practices, but because religion in his view is necessary in order to control the population. Since neo-conservatives influenced by Strauss are in control of the Bush administration, I have prepared a brief list that shows the radical unchristian basis of neo-conservatism. I am indebted to Shadia Drury’s book (Leo Strauss and the American Right) and published interviews for the following:  First: Strauss believed that a leader had to perpetually deceive the citizens he ruled.  Secondly: Those who lead must understand there is no morality, there is only the right of the superior to rule the inferior.  Thirdly:  According to Drury, Religion “is the glue that holds society together.”[40] It is a handle by which the ruler can manipulate the masses. Any religion will do. Strauss is indifferent to them all.  Fourthly: “Secular society…is the worst possible thing,” because it leads to individualism, liberalism, and relativism, all of which encourage dissent and rebellion. As Drury sums it up: “You want a crowd that you can manipulate like putty.”[41]  Fifthly: “Strauss thinks that a political order can be stable only if it is united by an external threat; and following Machiavelli, he maintains that if no external threat exists, then one has to be manufactured.”[42]  Sixthly: “In Strauss’s view, the trouble with liberal society is that it dispenses with noble lies and pious frauds. It tries to found society on secular rational foundations.”   Strauss’s Student, Harry Jaffa on the 700 Club with Pat Robertson   For four days in 1986, from July first through the fourth of July, Pat Robertson interviewed neo-conservative Dr. Harry Jaffa, a former student of Leo Strauss, on the 700 Club show. The topic was the importance of the Declaration of Independence. Joining with Jaffa was Robertson’s own man, Herb Titus, the Dean of CBN’s School of Public Policy. This series of interviews was one of the most important philosophical moments in the development of the political agenda and political philosophy of the Dominionists.  Robertson found in Harry Jaffa, the champion he needed, whose reasoning would influence how the Constitution should be interpreted by conservatives and would provide a “Christian” view of the establishment of the United States that excluded the secular social contract view. Harry Jaffa would influence both Clarence Thomas (who would be appointed to the Supreme Court by President George Bush senior in 1991) and Antonin Scalia (who would be appointed to the Supreme Court by President Ronald Reagan on September 26, 1986).  During the four days of interviews Jaffa and Titus agreed that the Declaration of Independence was the premier document and it superceded the Constitution. Titus said, “The Declaration…is the charter of the nation. It is what you might call the articles of incorporation, whereas the Constitution is the bylaws. The Constitution is the means by which to carry out the great purposes that are articulated in the Declaration.”  Robertson asked: “Let’s assume that eighty percent of the people are just totally immoral, they want to live lives of gross licentiousness and they want to prey on one another, that’s what they want and they want a government to let them do it. How does that square with the Declaration of Independence and its consent of the governed?”  Titus said, “Even the people can’t consent to give away that which God says is unalienable.”  Robertson then asked, “The principles enunciated in the Declaration of Independence, how far have we gone from it and what can we do to redress some of these problems?”  Jaffa responded cryptically:  “I’d say that today, for example in the Attorney General’s [Edwin Meese’s] warfare with the liberals on the Supreme Court, in his appeal to original intent, he appeals to the text of the Constitution. Jefferson and Madison said together in 1825, ‘If you want to find the principles of the Constitution of the United States, you go first to the Declaration of Independence.’”  First, Jaffa means by the term “original intent” that the Constitution must be interpreted according to what it meant when it was originally adopted. It is a revolutionary and brilliant idea that will allow the Dominionists to effectively repeal most of the judicial decisions made in the last century. [43]     Secondly, if we take Jaffa and the Dominionists at their word and go to the Declaration of Independence, we can see just how radical the conservative revolution and Dominionism are. The only portion that is ever quoted publicly are these words:  “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,”  The quote stops in the middle of the sentence—the part that is never quoted is this:  “That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.”  Dominionism then, takes its authority to overthrow the government of the United States from our own Declaration of Independence. By the time all Americans wake up to the Dominionist’s intent, it may be too late.  Though Harry Jaffa speaks with a high minded sense of political righteousness, Shadia Drury exposes his Machiavellian side. Like Strauss, he “clearly believes that devious and illegal methods are justified when those in power are convinced of the rightness of their ends.”[44] Jaffa and Robertson saw eye to eye on more than one topic: for instance, Jaffa like his host Pat Robertson, found Oliver North to be a hero (and by extension Michael Ledeen) when both North and Ledeen went around the law to provide military aid to the contras.[45]   How Dominionism Stealthily Swept Over America   Within a period of twenty to thirty years beginning in the 1970’s, Dominionism spread like wild fire throughout the evangelical, Pentecostal and fundamentalist religious communities in America. It was aided and abetted by television and radio evangelists. More than any other man, Pat Robertson mobilized the millions of politically indifferent and socially despised Pentecostals and fundamentalists in America and turned them into an angry potent army of political conquerors.[46]  But it would be a mistake to limit Dominionism to the Pentecostals and fundamentalists alone: conservative Roman Catholics and Episcopalians have joined and enlarged the swelling numbers.[47] Robertson, like other media preachers, used every form of communication: television, radio, books and audio tapes available for sale. One book stands out. Originally published in 1982 and written with Bob Slosser, a key Robertson loyalist, Pat Robertson’s The Secret Kingdom soared on the bestseller charts. It underwent four printings during its first year. By 1984 Bantam published a mass paperback in cooperation with Thomas Nelson, the original publisher. (Though the book has since been revised, my quotes are from the original version.)  However, it was the Pentecostals and fundamentalists who made up the core of Robertson’s audience. To a people who were largely uneducated and who often remained ignorant even if they went through college because of their fear of becoming tainted by the “world and worldliness,” Dominionism came as a brilliant light that assuaged their deep sense of inferiority. Pentecostals in particular could take comfort from the notion that no longer would the world think of them as “Holy Rollers” who danced in the “Spirit” and practiced glossolalia. This time, they would be on top—they would be the head and not the tail—and the so-called elite, the educated of the world, would be on the bottom.  A new world was coming. To help the transition along, Pat Robertson, along with other pastors, evangelists and churchmen, founded schools, universities and colleges throughout the United States to train “Christians” how to run for office, how to win, and how to manage the affairs of government after they gained office. To get an idea of how successful the plan was, Robertson’s Regent University now has a $100 million endowment. After watching the Dominionists takeover the Republican Party and observing their ruthless methods, it is indeed apparent that Machiavellian principles are the fuel running their “How to Manual.”  Starting with a class of only twelve in 1985, Robertson began his Journalism Department at CBN University where 800 other graduate students were earning Master degrees in a fully accredited institution. Later Robertson changed the name of CBN University to “Regent University”—based on Dominionism’s teaching that the national government of America and governments of the world will be ruled by Dominionists, who will act as regents on an interim basis, that is, until the true King—Jesus Christ—will return to earth again and gratefully accept His Kingdom from the hands of His faithful regents.   The Dominionist Plan: Today Control the USA, Tomorrow the World   Significantly, Dominionism is a form of Social Darwinism.[48] It inherently includes the religious belief that wealth-power is a sign of God’s election. That is, out of the masses of people and the multitude of nations—wealth, in and of itself, is thought to indicate God’s approval on men and nations whereas poverty and sickness reflect God’s disapproval. The roots of the idea come from a natural twist of an Old Testament passage, which I discuss below. Essentially there were two elements necessary to establish Dominionism among Christians who previously believed helping the poor was a mandate of Christianity.[49]  First, Old Testament law had to be accepted as an essential part of a Christian’s theology.  Secondly, the Christian had to undergo a second conversion-like experience that went beyond being born again and demanded not only a commitment to reestablishing the Old Testament legal structure but required the implementation of that law in the nations of the world (including the U.S.) based upon a different understanding of the Great Commission (Matthew 28: 18-20).[50]  Under this concept Dominionists are to go into all the world to take dominion and “make disciples” teaching the disciples to “observe all” that Jesus “commanded.” All nations under Dominionist’s teaching are to convert to biblical laws, which are ranked superior to secular laws that were not God given or God directed and are found wanting. The Christian therefore must be willing to overthrow all laws that are secular.  In other words, a measure of one’s spirituality rested upon the individual’s willingness to accept the concept of taking dominion over not only the people of America, but taking dominion over the people of the entire world. From Dominionists’ actual words, the taking of America is perceived as a violent act. Ben Kinchlow who co-hosted CBN’s 700 Club with Pat Robertson told an audience, “We need to grab the American dream by the short hairs and snatch it back to where it was originally designed to be.”  As Robertson wrote approvingly in his book, The Secret Kingdom, the kingdom of heaven “suffers violence, and violent men take it by force.” He explained, “Zealous men force their way in. That’s what it means.” (Page 82.)   What “Dominion” Means   There were an estimated 110,000 Pentecostal and fundamentalist churches in America in the 1980s. Robertson taught them—through his vast television network and through his books—that the role of the Christian is to rule over the wicked. Dominionism’s purpose is to create theocrats (a Christian class of rulers). But in order to successfully place only certain Christians in positions of power, Dominionism divides Christian believers into classes based upon political ideology and certain hot point issues such as the privatization of Social Security and Medicare, freedom to decide on medical procedures with ones own physician, freedom of the press and freedom of speech, freedom of the arts, and certain rights like the right to a fair trial and protection from governmental intrusion into the privacy of marriage and adult associations.  The believers who are destined to rule are called the “elect,” and are separated from those believers who do not and will not accept the predestined superiority of the chosen ruling class. A Christian who raises his voice against the “elect” could be labeled a “false prophet or a dreamer of dreams,” and therefore, according to the Deuteronomic law “shall be put to death.”  Placing his own words in the mouth of God, Robertson wrote in The Secret Kingdom:  “It is clear that God is saying, ‘I gave man dominion over the earth, but he lost it. Now I desire mature sons and daughters who will in My name exercise dominion over the earth and will subdue Satan, the unruly, and the rebellious. Take back My world from those who would loot it and abuse it. Rule as I would rule.’” (p. 201.)  On his 700 Club television show (5-1-86) Robertson said:  “God’s plan is for His people, ladies and gentlemen to take dominion…What is dominion? Well, dominion is Lordship. He wants His people to reign and rule with Him…but He’s waiting for us to…extend His dominion…And the Lord says, ‘I’m going to let you redeem society. There’ll be a reformation….We are not going to stand for those coercive utopians in the Supreme Court and in Washington ruling over us any more. We’re not gonna stand for it. We are going to say, ‘we want freedom in this country, and we want power…’”  Charles Colson, the former Special Counsel to Richard Nixon, who was called “Nixon’s Hatchet Man,” pled guilty to charges in the Daniel Ellsberg case during the Watergate Scandal. He served a prison sentence, and started a prison ministry afterward. Pat Robertson has called him “the most brilliant political strategist in the world.” Over the years, Colson made many appearances on the 700 Club. On one occasion, he laid out the battle lines:  “It always has been a conflict between the kingdoms: the kingdom of God and the kingdom of man. When you really look at what Jesus is saying, He is saying the time is fulfilled, repent and believe, the kingdom is at hand. And He is calling for the kingdom of God to rule over the affairs of man. And so inevitably there’s going to be a conflict.” (The 700 Club 5-21-86)  Robertson said on his program the 700 Club (5-13-86):  “We’ve sat idly by long enough and said, ‘Well religion and politics don’t mix.’ Don’t you believe it. If we don’t have moral people in government then the only other people that can be in government are immoral. That’s the only way it goes. Either you have moral people in there or you have immoral people.”  On another show (5-7-86) he revealed a partial list of changes the Dominionists planned for America:  “We can change the government, we can change the court systems, we can change the poverty problem, we can change education…We can make a difference.”   Who Rules? And Who Are to Be the Ruled?   In an earlier section, I discussed the principle held by both Machiavelli and Leo Strauss that religion is necessary as a tool for a leader to control the masses. If conformity—not dissent is required, then religion is the power tool of choice, for it will insure a controlled populace. We’re about to examine its uses, its ingenious gifts and its powers, in this and the following sections. Be aware that Dominionism is in fact, a brilliantly executed road that leads to total power.  In his book, which tended to be more formal and less expansive, Pat Robertson began the listing of those Americans not fit for public office:  “Obviously the drunk, the drug addict, the lustful, the slothful do not have the discipline to rule the earth and to correct its evils.” (p. 82)  “If we remain unrighteous, the Bible says, we will miss the kingdom.” (p.83)  Then he quoted Paul’s epistle to the Corinthians:  “Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God.”(1 Corinthians 6:9-10) (p. 83)  If “Secular Humanists are the greatest threat to Christianity the world has ever known,” as theologian Francis Schaeffer claimed, then who are the Humanists? According to Dominionists, humanists are the folks who allow or encourage licentious behavior in America. They are the undisciplined revelers.  Put all the enemies of the Dominionists together, boil them down to liquid and bake them into the one single most highly derided and contaminated individual known to man, and you will have before you an image of the quintessential “liberal”—one of those folks who wants to give liberally to the poor and needy—who desires the welfare and happiness of all Americans—who insists on safety regulations for your protection and who desires the preservation of your values—those damnable people are the folks that must be reduced to powerlessness—or worse: extinction.  Dominionists determine who is among God’s elect—not solely by a religious experience such as being born again, but by a political determination of whether one is a Republican or a Democrat, a liberal or a conservative or simply a person who questions the deeds of Dominionist political figures. The politics of exclusion, including bigotry, is in fact wide spread throughout the United States.  Take, for instance, Sean Hannity’s remarks to Time Magazine, “You can play golf with liberals, be neighbors with them, go out to dinner. I just don’t want them in power.”[51] Or take Ann Coulter’s assertions: “Liberals have a preternatural gift for striking a position on the side of treason.” Or, “Whenever the nation is under attack, from within or without, liberals side with the enemy.” (It turns out that every single “liberal” in the country is a member of the Democratic Party and therefore is a traitor.)[52]  The Machiavellian nature of the Dominionist cult explains why Bill Clinton who is a Christian believer was attacked so viciously for his sexual folly but Newt Gingrich, Bill Livingston, Henry Hyde, Strom Thurmond and scores of other Republicans escaped the punishment of public ridicule, verbal abuse, and humiliation for the same sexual peccadilloes. (It appears only Democratic “liberals” must be held to the fire of biblical standards and biblical punishments because as we all know, they are “unregenerate from the beginning of time.”)  Robertson’s book acknowledges that his followers, the “Christian” army raised up for political purposes are the elect chosen to rule. Robertson’s transcribed television interviews and dialogs give shocking evidence to the legitimization of greed, hatred, violence and cruelty by members of the various fundamentalist branches of the American clergy and by elected officials of the Republican Party, which can be cited as evidence that Dominionism is not a Christian religion—that above everything else, Dominionism is synonymous with Machiavellianism: the ends justify the means. Under Dominionism, true Christianity is a target to destroy, not a goal to achieve.   Who Lives and Who Dies? How Justice Scalia Would Expand the Death Penalty   In one of those peculiar moments when a host on television seems to have a disconnect with his guest, I realized that Pat Robertson was using “code” with Herb Titus, his “guest” on the show on May 27, 1985. Titus was the Dean of CBN University’s School of Public Policy and was a known Christian Reconstructionist (Dominionist) who had written position papers arguing that government has exceeded its authority by requiring individuals such as doctors, lawyers, and teachers to be licensed by the state. Robertson, himself, revealed what the School of Public Policy was teaching on a later show (July 5, 1985). “What are we going to teach them? We’ll teach them the foundation of our government. We’re going to teach them how to win elections.”  This exchange with Titus occurred on May 27, 1985:  Robertson:  “We have with us today Constitutional authority, Herb Titus. Herb . . . . How about the biblical concept of war? You know there are many people who don’t think we should ever fight wars and yet we’re talking about brave men who died for freedom.” (Emphasis added)  Titus: “Well I believe the scripture is very clear that if you are attacked by evil whether within the country or outside the country, that it’s the duty of the civil authorities to defend the nation and the people of the nation from evil whether it comes from an aggressor outside or an aggressor inside. We can see that in Romans 13 for example.”  Curious about the meaning of what was being said, particularly since Robertson had asked a question about war, and Titus’ answer included war against one’s own population, I looked up Romans 13. I had always read this passage to be St. Paul’s concept of a good government providing beneficial services to the governed and I restricted its meaning to only a lawfully constituted government that rules justly.  But read Romans 13 in the light of Machiavelli’s and Leo Strauss’s discourses on religion and its uses by a political leader, and one glimpses the danger that Dominionism represents to the American people and to the American way of life. For it can be read to mean that any lawful government is ordained by God to execute retribution and punishment upon those who challenge (resist or rebel against) unjust policies of a government. When read this way, it takes on a new and sinister meaning. Or, it can be read to mean that once a new government of the United States of America has been established under biblical law—then no citizen will have the right to resist it or rebel against its edicts. In other words, the Declaration of Independence will no longer be applicable to the regency established by the Dominionists.  This is how Romans 13 reads in the New English Version:  “Every person must submit to the supreme authorities. There is no authority but by act of God, and the existing authorities are instituted by him; consequently anyone who rebels against authority is resisting a divine institution, and those who so resist have themselves to thank for the punishment they will receive. For government, a terror to crime, has no terrors for good behaviour. You wish to have no fear of the authorities? Then continue to do right and you will have their approval, for they are God’s agents working for your good. But if you are doing wrong, then you will have cause to fear them; it is not for nothing that they hold the power of the sword, for they are God’s agents of punishment, for retribution on the offender. That is why you are obliged to submit. It is an obligation imposed not merely by fear of retribution but by conscience. That is also why you pay taxes. The authorities are in God’s service and to these duties they devote their energies.”  This section, if taken literally as fundamentalists are apt to do, appears to prohibit any kind of resistance against the policies of a government, including peaceful protests, petitions, and writings. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia appears to endorse that position, for he quoted this same Romans 13 passage in his article, “God’s Justice and Ours,” to prove that Christian doctrine states “government—however you want to limit that concept—derives its moral authority from God.”[53] Government is not only the “minister of God” but it has the authority to “execute God’s wrath.”  The power of the sword is surely the power to kill or maim and certainly the power to intimidate. Scalia believes the power of the sword in this passage is “unmistakably a reference to the death penalty.”  At this point, Scalia demonstrates the absolute brilliance of the judicial rule created by neo-conservatives that requires a judge to determine the “original intent” of the writers of the Constitution. As Scalia himself describes it, “The Constitution that I interpret and apply is not living but dead…It means today not what current society…thinks it ought to mean, but what it meant when it was adopted.”[54] Once the original thinking is determined, the judge can enforce the Constitution only as a document that is bound by the time zone in which a particular passage was written.  When I first read articles by authors who were exposing the Dominionists’ intention to extend the death penalty to cover “crimes” like adultery, rebelliousness, homosexuality, witchcraft or effeminateness, I found the death penalty extension goal to be laughable. It couldn’t be done in America.  I was wrong. I now realize that we are very close to seeing the Dominionists achieve their goal. All they need to do is to appoint a majority of judges who will adhere to the “dead Constitution” construction rule of Scalia (or what Harry Jaffa called “the original intent” construction rule). At the point when the Dominionist’s control the judiciary—that judiciary can roll back America’s body of legal jurisprudence to a century or more ago as Law Professor Patricia J. Williams pointed out.[55]  Scalia spilled the beans in his article, “God’s Justice and Ours” when he explained how he would determine whether the death penalty is constitutional or not. His reasoning goes like this: since the death penalty was “clearly permitted when the Eighth Amendment [which prohibits ‘cruel and unusual punishments’] was adopted,” and at that time the death penalty was applied for all felonies—including, for example, the felony of horse-thieving, “so it is clearly permitted today.”[56] Justice Scalia left no doubt that if the crime of horse stealing carried a death penalty today in the United States—he would find that law constitutional.  All a willing Dominionist Republican controlled congress need do to extend the death penalty to those people who practice witchcraft, adultery, homosexuality, heresy, etcetera, is to find those particular death penalty laws existing as of November 3, 1791, and re-instate them. No revolution is required. That’s why the battle over Bush’s judicial appointments is so crucial to the future of the America we know and love. And that’s why the clock is running out on freedom loving Americans.  Scalia himself appears to be a Dominionist, for he believes that Romans 13 represents the correct view— that government authority is derived from God and not from the people; he asserts his view was the consensus of Western thought until recent times. Like Pat Robertson, he laments that the biblical perspective was upset by “the emergence of democracy.”[57] Taking his cue from Leo Strauss, Scalia argued, “a democratic government, being nothing more than the composite will of its individual citizens, has no more moral power or authority than they do as individuals.” Democracy, according to Scalia, creates problems, “It fosters civil disobedience.”[58]  As Patricia Williams wrote: “God bless America. The Constitution is dead.”[59]   Dominionism’s Theocratic Views   What would a “reconstructed” America look like under the Dominionists?  K.L. Gentry, a Dominionist himself, suggests the following “elements of a theonomic approach to civic order,” which I strongly suggest should be compared to the Texas GOP platform of 2002, which reveals that we are not just talking about imaginary ideas but some things are already proposed on Republican agendas.[60] Dominionism’s concept of government according to Gentry is as follows:  “1. It obligates government to maintain just monetary policies ... [thus prohibiting] fiat money, fractional reserve banking, and deficit spending.  “2. It provides a moral basis for elective government officials. ...  “3. It forbids undue, abusive taxation of the rich. ...  “4. It calls for the abolishing of the prison system and establishing a system of just restitution. ...  “5. A theonomic approach also forbids the release, pardoning, and paroling of murderers by requiring their execution. ...  “6. It forbids industrial pollution that destroys the value of property. ...  “7. It punishes malicious, frivolous malpractice suits. ...  “8. It forbids abortion rights. ... Abortion is not only a sin, but a crime, and, indeed, a capital crime.”[61]  The fourth item in Gentry’s list, “abolishing of the prison system and establishing a system of just restitution” has been worked on extensively by Dominionist Gary North, who holds a doctorate degree in Economics. North has written volumes of books, essays and articles, (many of which falsely predicted that the year 2000 computer problem would bring down modern civilization.) He is most famous among Dominionists for reconciling economic theory with Old Testament passages.    Gary North describes the ‘just restitution’ system of the bible, which happens to reinstitute slavery, like this:  “At the other end of the curve, the poor man who steals is eventually caught and sold into bondage under a successful person. His victim receives payment; he receives training; his buyer receives a stream of labor services. If the servant is successful and buys his way out of bondage, he re-enters society as a disciplined man, and presumably a self-disciplined man. He begins to accumulate wealth.”[62]   The Immorality of the Medicare and Medicaid Programs   If the blithe acceptance of slavery isn’t shocking enough, here is one of the coldest attitudes I ever heard expressed in an interview on American television. I can’t help reading it in light of the coercive bullying tactics resorted to by Dominionist leaders in the House of Representatives to get the necessary votes to pass the controversial new Medicare Prescription Drug law.[63] The following interview reveals the deep seated hatred Dominionists have against governmental medical assistance to the elderly. The interview was conducted on August 1, 1985 with Dr. Walter Williams, professor of economics at George Mason University and author of thirty-five books. Danuta Soderman was a co-host on Pat Robertson’s 700 Club. She began the interview with a question about Medicare and Medicaid fraud, suggesting cost possibly “millions and billions” of dollars:  Williams: “Well, I think that the abuse and fraud in and of itself is a relatively minor problem. That is, the bigger problem is the whole concept of funding somebody’s medical care by a third party. And I might also mention here, that is, I saw in the audience many older and senior citizens. Now whose responsibility is it to take care of those people? I think it lies with their children and it also lies with themselves. That is, I think Christians should recognize that charity is good. I mean charity, when you reach into your pocket to help your fellow man for medical care or for food or to give them housing. But what the government is doing in order to help these older citizens is not charity at all. It is theft. That is, the government is using power to confiscate property that belongs to one American and give, or confiscate their money, and provide services for another set of Americans to whom it does not belong. That is the moral question that Christians should face with not only Medicare, Medicaid. But many other programs as well….Well, people should have insurance. But I would say if our fellow man is found in need, does not have enough, well that’s a role for the church, that’s a role for the family, that’s a role for private institutions to take care of these things.”  Danuta Soderman: “I thought it was interesting you talked about Medicare and Medicaid as not being a moral issue. A lot of people would think that to want to eliminate the program is rather uncompassionate—that there is something immoral about taking away something that people are relying so heavily upon, but you said that there is no moral issue here.”  Williams: “I think the moral issue runs the other way. That is, we have to ask ourselves, ‘What is the moral basis of confiscating the property of one American and giving it to another American to whom it does not belong for whatever reason?’ That is, I think we Americans have to ask ourselves is there something that can justify a legalized theft? And I think that even if the person is starving in the street that act, in and of itself, doesn’t justify my taking money from somebody else.”   How to Destroy the Social Security Program   On August 14, 1985, Pat Robertson unveiled his ingenious program on how to get rid of Social Security. The plan amazingly resembles sections of the Bush Administration’s Medicare Prescription Drug bill passed in December of 2003. Robertson, however, outlined what to do twenty years ago as follows:  1.  “We should say to all the elderly, ‘You’re going to be taken care of. The government’s going to pay you. Don’t worry about it. [You’ll] get your Social Security like you’re expecting, ‘cause you’re counting on it.”  2. “There should be a gradual moving [up] of [the retirement] age to reflect the fact that we’re healthier and we live longer and people should have dignity and be allowed to work a little bit longer.”  3. “The last thing we should do is to begin to let the younger workers slowly but surely go into private programs where the money is tax sheltered and over the years build up their own money and that would in turn, through the intermediary organizations, banks, insurance companies, would invest in American industry. They would buy plants and equipment, put people to work and it would help a tremendous boom. Imagine …$100 billion dollars a year flowing into American industry. It would be marvelous.”   Wealth is a Sign of God’s Favor, Poverty is a Sign of God’s Disfavor   How did the Dominionists get so far from the Lord’s edict to help the poor, the sick, and the elderly? Using the text of Deuteronomy 28, which is a list of God’s blessings and curses, Robertson and other Dominionists believe that the chapter reveals God’s covenanted economic law. God only bestows “material wealth or blessings” upon those who are among his elect and he does so because these are the individuals and nations who obey his commandments and laws. So what about the poor? Dominionist Gary North explains it this way:  "God is sovereign over the poor. He raises them up—not all of them, but some of them. ‘The Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.’”[64]  I grant that the verse cited leaves government assistance out of the picture. North claims, the blessings and sanctions of Deuteronomy 28 are historical. He says, “They are predictable. Covenantal rebellion by a society will lead to God’s imposition of these sanctions.”[65] North then ties the package up neatly: “The blessings and cursings of God under the Mosaic Covenant were sure. They were not disconnected from God’s law. There was a bedrock objectivity that united covenant-keepers and covenant-breakers.”[66]  To understand what North is talking about, we have to read a portion of the text of Deuteronomy 28:  “The Lord shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, as he hath sworn unto thee…and the Lord shall make thee the head and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath…”  A conclusion drawn by the scripture itself is that a nation who follows the commandments or laws of God will be “high above all nations of the earth…and all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the Lord, and they shall be afraid of thee.” On the other hand, the Dominionists believe those who are poor, sick, and weak are so situated because God’s wrath has been visited upon them—they are the “wicked” of this earth and they deserve the wrath of God because their behavior is bringing the entire nation under condemnation.  The litany of the curses of God on those who do not keep his laws and commandments are among the most horrendous descriptions of torture in literature. Here is a sample from Deuteronomy 28:  “The Lord shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies…thy carcass shall be food unto all fowls of the air…The Lord will smite thee with [boils]…and with …tumors, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed. The Lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart [fear]; thou shalt grope at noonday; thou shalt not prosper in thy ways; and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore…thou shalt betroth a wife and another man shall lie with her; thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein, and thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof; thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face and shall not be restored to thee; they sheep shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to rescue them. Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long; and there shall be no might in thine hand. The fruit of thy land, and all thy labors, shall a nation whom thou knowest not eat up, and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed always…”  Gary North explained: “The point of Deuteronomy 28 is this: the way to wealth, both individual and corporate, is through systematic adherence to God’s Bible-revealed law.”[67]  Hence the idea that should a nation minister to the poor or attempt to lift the poor out of poverty or save people from poverty and ill health, that nation is contravening the will of Almighty God and such legislation is contrary to the laws of God. It is only one step further to say that if this is God’s attitude toward the poor, it is morally wrong to help them. So it’s easy to see how Social Security and Medicare are viewed by Dominionists as “evil” programs that rob money from some citizens to enrich others.  There’s one other little trap for the unwary Dominionist; when a government is seen to be the enforcer of the Deuteronomic laws, it’s easy to take the next step and say that it is the duty of the “Christian” Dominionist government to subdue the wicked of the world, especially the vast American middle class, because its collective licentious life style is bringing the nation down as a whole; therefore the government must “minister the wrath of God” against the citizens of America as punishment for “rebelliousness.” That the entire scheme is an unending circular argument, escapes the notice of the rank and file sitting in the pews.  In their new role as ministers of God’s wrath against this nation, Dominionist political strategists are aware they must not be seen as being cruel and hateful. So at first, until the population is completely subdued and dominated by the elect, Dominionists are forced to devise laws that will create the political, social, and medical environment that will ultimately ensure that the wicked are punished—but it will appear—at first blush to be a gift. The truth, of course, according to Machiavellian/Straussian dictates, must be hidden from the population; not just once or twice, but over and over again.  In the end, Dominionism should be viewed as a backboard that bounces the New Deal and FDR’s social safety net programs, social security (as well as Medicare) into its political opposite: laissez-faire economics (the motto of 18th century French economists who protested excessive government regulation of industry.) Laissez-faire is a doctrine opposing governmental interference (as by regulation or subsidy) in economic affairs beyond the minimum necessary for the maintenance of peace and property rights. Dominionism opposes the licensing and regulating power of the government.  One last comment on Pat Robertson. On November 3, 1986, the 700 Club ran a piece on the use of computers in counting votes. Robertson ended his Perspective by saying there should be some kind of control on computer voting to assure an honest count. How prescient this man is! And how worrisome his prescience is.   Who Is on the Side of Freedom? Let Him Speak Now!   There is an infection, a religious and political pathology that has corrupted our churches. Those we trusted the most have embraced evil. That knowledge is almost more than we can bear. Who among us will stand in the gap and make up the hedge to save our nation?  When we look for help—for the wealthy leaders with the means to help rescue America, we find they have all defected to the Dominionists. They do not realize that if the middle class of America is wiped out—there will be no one to buy their cars, their computers or their products. Only one or two brave souls like George Soros have made massive contributions to combat the think tanks and the organized political machine of the Dominionists. The corporate press lies sleeping, not realizing they will be allowed to report only what they are instructed to report.  Freedom is under siege. There is only one free major political party still left in America. I know the Democrats look chaotic, unfocused and generally unsmooth and thank God, unprogramed. Make no mistake, these plain ordinary citizens are holding the candles that together form the great torch of liberty. For all their faults, they love America and they love freedom and they love the Bill of Rights. America’s independents, its true Conservatives, its sensible Republicans, and its Libertarians must join hands together with the homely Democrats and take back America for all Americans.  The livelihood of the working people of America is at stake. The Dominionists have lost more American jobs in the last three years than since the days of Herbert Hoover. And now they want to eliminate the minimum wage laws too. America’s unions have helped to create a better life for millions of workers. The Dominionists want to break all unions apart (especially the teacher’s union). As Americans, we love our schools and are proud of our educational system. The Dominionists want to destroy all public education in America and force Americans to be educated in their religious schools. Americans love our culture and the arts. The Dominionists want to destroy that culture.  The election of 2004 is not just another election. It is the battle of the century. It is the gravest political war since the Civil War, which if lost, spells the end of Independence Day and every right in the Bill of Rights that we have fought so hard to preserve. Is there an American, regardless of his or her party, who would not fight for our Democracy? It’s in jeopardy now. Our friends and cousins in Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand and scores of other nations have seen our jeopardy and have been crying out for months and days and years to wake up America!  Let me see your face and look into your eyes. Let me hear you say, “There is no difference between the two parties.” May God help us and grant us discernment when we vote.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Notes to The Despoiling of America  [1] “Religious Right Finds Its Center in Oval Office,” Washington Post, December 24, 2001.

This is the product of a conspiracy that has been growing over the past few decades through the use of evil tactics and strategies, lies and deceptions to transform America.  “Deception is now the hallmark of the Bush administration. Read of the frightening chicanery in furthering an imperial strategy, nurturing the military-industrial complex, waging war on the environment, plunging the nation into debt, demeaning the needy, antagonizing the world and using terrorism to frighten and exploit.”  The author calls on patriots to apply the principles of democracy now to retake America from a conservative elite that controls the country.

[12] See Joan Bokaer’s article in “The Rise of the Religious Right in the Republican Party,” a public information project from TheocracyWatch.org  http://www.4religious-right.info/taking_over.htm  [13] Ben Kinchlow, co-host of the 700 Club with Pat Robertson, was made Vice President of CBN in charge of CBN’s charities program “Operation Blessing.” On March 27, 1985, while criticizing farmers for wanting a government bailout he said: “What’s wrong in this country is that so many people have substituted the government for God. Instead of looking to God to supply their needs, they’re looking to government.” Railing at financially stressed people was very common on the show.  [14] Tim LaHaye predicted on Pat Robertson’s 700 Club show on September 25, 1985 that 110,000 evangelical, fundamentalist, and Pentecostal churches could sponsor one person per church to run for office and win, that in a decade they would hold every office in the U.S. At the time, he said there were only 97,000 public offices in the U.S. so “we would have more Christians in office than there are positions.” By 1994, for the first time in forty years, Republicans regained control of Congress. Similarly Ralph Reed predicted that by the year 2,000 they would control Congress. Gary North wrote in 1985: “I propose a program. Some variant of this program must be adopted if we are to have any meaningful hope in recapturing the machinery of civil government, the media, and the educational institutions. It will be done. It has already begun. How long it will take is problematical; I think we will begin to see major victories before the year 2005.” http://reformed-theology.org/ice/books/conspiracy/html/8.htm at page 5 of 11 pages.  [15] Francis Schaeffer originally appeared on the 700 Club with Pat Robertson in 1982. The series of interviews with Schaeffer were repeated on the show in the week of July 7, 1986 as Robertson presented the legal and biblical foundations for Christian political action. Francis Schaeffer, however, died between the first and second airing. The Schaeffer interviews were tape recorded and transcribed, my quotes are from my transcript. The accuracy of my transcript can be compared to the video tapes of the shows. At the time, People for the American Way was recording the shows and establishing a Pat Robertson 700 Club library for future reference.  [16] All 700 Club quotes in this article were recorded and transcribed by the author and her assistant unless otherwise indicated.  [17] Although neither Robertson nor Schaeffer used the words “Dominionism” or “dominion” in this interview series they used the word “dominant” when asking which culture was dominant in the United States: the Christian culture or the humanistic culture. They asserted the humanistic culture was the dominant force in America and “Christians” had to regain dominance.  [18] The most successful ministers knew the psychological importance of creating “enemies” that were attacking the church. Jerry Falwell maintains the rule: “To be successful, keep a good fight going all the time.”  [19] Psychiatrist Scott Peck has written about the phenomena groups resort to almost universally in his book, The People of the Lie, “There are profound forces at work within a group to keep its individual members together and in line...Probably the most powerful of these group cohesive forces is narcissism…group pride….A less benign but practically universal form of group narcissism is what might be called ‘enemy creation,’ or hatred of the ‘out-group.’”  [20] “War on Secular Society” at http://www.4religious-right.info/introduction2.htm  [21] In short, they needed a religion of their own to justify evil acts and to counter the political acceptance by many Christians who were attracted to the communal and “communistic” principles of the early church (Acts 2:42-47), where the early Christians sold all their possessions, gave them to the needy, and held “all things [in] common.” Such Christian ideas were a direct threat to capitalism’s future robber barons. How could great fortunes be amassed if one had to give it all away to the poor and follow Jesus? (Matthew 19:16-30.)  [22] Pat Robertson is particularly adept at changing the issue from questioning an aggressively religious political agenda into an attack on religion. The Constitution prohibits a religious test for office in America (Article 6). However, a battle over the nomination of Herb Ellingwood in 1985 to the position of Assistant Attorney General for Legal Policy caused a fire storm. (That office screens candidates for the federal judiciary.) During the same period dominionists like Ellingwood and Tim LaHaye were advocating that twenty-five percent of all government positions should be handed to Christian fundamentalists (dominionists) since they made up twenty-five percent of the nation’s population. Pat Schroeder, former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado and chairman of the Civil Service Committee strongly opposed the view as a religious quota system and a violation of Article VI of the Constitution. She said the questions that were asked of judicial candidates, apparently prepared by Ellingwood, amounted to a religious test for office. She spoke on the Phil Donahue show on (September 6, 1985):  “If you look at some of the questions that are being asked by some of the senators of judges, they don’t have to do with their background, their training, whether or not they understand the law, they have to do with personal beliefs. That’s not where we have been in the past, and that’s a very dangerous turn…”  During the same period of time (August-September) Pat Robertson easily turned the legitimate questioning of Herb Ellingwood’s agenda into an attack on Christianity by framing it this way on his 700 Club Show on August 9, 1985:  “Can an evangelical Christian hold high office in the United States of America? Now that is the question. Or are evangelical Christians going to be discriminated against? And indeed will there be a religious test for public office which disqualifies anybody who speaks to a religious group? . . . .Herb Ellingwood is Chairman right now of the Merit Protection Review Board and he has done a superb job. He was the former legal counsel to President Reagan in California and has worked closely with Ed Meese for years. He’s been a very distinguished attorney. It just seems like this campaign of assassination that goes on against good men like that should be brought to a stop. . .And if you feel that Christians ought to be allowed to serve in positions of responsibility in the government…and you don’t think that Christians should be discriminated against…here’s the number of the White House: 202 446-7639…” (700 Club 8-9-85)  [23] One cannot help comparing this passage with the fact that 27,000 bombs were dropped on Iraq in the 2003 air war and in a demonstration of cold indifference, the Bush administration ignored the advice of prominent archeologists to protect Iraq’s museums, which contained the greatest collection of ancient relics, art, and ancient treasures in the world, and in so doing, allowed the looting—the despoiling—of that nation’s treasures.  [24]Again, because we will learn in this article that Machiavelli is a handbook in the Bush administration, one must ask if the George W. Bush administration perceives despoiling as a plan of action to control the American populace. The question must be asked.  [25] See Kevin Phillips, author of American Dynasty, Aristocracy, Fortune, and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush. Viking Press, 2004, at page 239-240.  [26] Ibid. at page 321.  [27] Robertson’s and Ledeen’s relationship continues.  For a recent CBN interview of Ledeen conducted by Pat Robertson and transcribed by CBN.com go to: http://cbn.com/CBNNews/News/030623e.asp?option=print  [28] Ledeen tried to arrange the sale of arms to Iran in order to divert the profits to the Contra militants who were fighting the Nicaraguan government’s Sandinistas. However, Congress had voted to cut off U.S. aid to the Contras and therefore any such transaction was illegal.  [29] William O. Beeman’s article, “Who Is Michael Ledeen?” was published on May 8, 2003 and may be read at the alternet.org: http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=15860  [30] Gerard Thomas Straub worked at CBS for eight years before joining the 700 Club as executive producer. After leaving CBN’s employment, he went to work for ABC’s “General Hospital” as associate producer. His 1986 book, Salvation for Sale, (Prometheus Books, N.Y.) offers insights to how Pat Robertson conducted business off camera from the perspective of an insider. The dichotomy between his public friendly “pastoral” role and his actual business conduct is stark evidence that he understood Machiavelli’s rule that only appearance counts. Straub wrote: “In reality Pat is a pompous pope of the video Vatican of Christian broadcasting, and he rules his empire with absolute authority. He does not tolerate debate, discussions, or dissent…His television followers never get to see the tough-minded, hard-driving cut-throat leader.” In addition, over the years, Pat Robertson revealed his Machiavellian political philosophy repeatedly and openly on his show in discussions of how to handle foreign policy and in his ruthless approach to the poor and needy of America.  [31] On June 19, 1985: Danuta Soderman, the second member of Pat Robertson’s daily team, asked Pat Robertson how the United States should deal with middle-east terrorist groups: “Speaking about being decisive in dealing with terrorists’ groups, yesterday you offered some opinion on how Iran should be one of the places we should target our energies on, any other thoughts on this?  Robertson: “Just like the last guest in that clip our news department did, he said it’s pretty much undeclared war. Khomeini has declared war against the United States. He has told people that if they die against the infidel, they go to heaven. The Islamic Jihad is controlled out of Iran, and the other factor of course is Syria, which is giving some sanctuary to all of these people. Syria controls the Becca Valley now— practically all of it, since Israel withdrew its forces. So up in the Becca Valley the Shiite Muslims from Iran are forcing the Lebanese women to wear veils and practice the various extreme views of the Islamic faith in the Shiite traditions. We’ve got to go after the source. If you want to go after a snake you don’t cut inches off his tail.”  Robertson also focused on the Becca Valley on July 12, 1985 and on several other occasions. The refrain has not changed in nineteen years. A recent January 2004 article published in the Jerusalem Post states Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is considering invading the Becca Valley, which is still controlled by Syria.

[39] The only example of this possibility I have found so far is in the work of Dominionist Gary North who wrote tirelessly on the correlations between conservative economic principles and the Old Testament laws and rules. See Gary North, “The Covenantal Wealth of Nations,” from Biblical Economics Today, Vol. XXI, No 2, February/March 1999. It can be read at: http://reformed-theology.org/ice/newslet/bet/bet99.02.htm See also an article by J.

For instance, Gary North has written volume after volume deriving principles of economics from his studies of the Pentateuch.”  [40] Shadia Drury, Leo Strauss and the American Right, St. Martin’s Press, 1999 at page 11-13.  [41] Shadia Drury is quoted in an analysis by Jim Lobe for the Inter Press Service News Agency. http://www.ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=18038  [42] Shadia Drury, Leo Strauss and the American Right, St. Martin’s Press, 1999 at page 23.  [43] I’m indebted to Patricia J. Williams, Professor of law at Columbia University for this insight. See her article, “Infallible Justice,” The Nation; October 7, 2002 at http://www.thenation.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20021007&s=williams   Not only is the concept of “original intent brilliant and revolutionary, it in fact goes further than any other political format to legitimize the conversion of present day jurisprudence back to the judicial weltanschauung (world view) of eighteenth century jurists. It is the key factor in the Dominionist’s intent to establish biblical law over all Americans. Two Supreme Court justices subscribe to it already. In other words, as Law Professor Patricia J. Williams has pointed out, the rule would effectively repeal most of the judicial decisions made in the last century.  [44] Shadia Drury, Leo Strauss and the American Right, St. Martin’s Press, 1999 at page 106.  [45] Ibid.  [46] See the excerpts from my book, The New Messiahs which trace the political machinations of the Dominionists within the Republican Party and the plot to take over all three branches of the government of the United States.  [47] J. Ligon Duncan, III “Moses Law for Modern Government: The Intellectual and Sociological Origins of the Christian Reconstructionist Movement,” Premise, Vol. II Number 5, May 27, 1995. http://capo.org/premise/95/may/ssha2.html.  [48] Social Darwinism is the discredited extension of Darwin’s evolutionary theory to the human social condition. Social Darwinism takes Charles Darwin’s concept, “the survival of the fittest,” and applies it to the idea that the ladder to material wealth and to the “good life” may be climbed only after one has successfully engaged in group battles and conflicts and prevailed in the pit of life by drop kicking one’s opponents. Those who climb out of the pit and up the ladder become the socially recognized victors in the competition and are considered biologically superior to those who fail. The illogical fallout from this concept is the circular argument that the existence of a socially elite class must be proof that those who possess wealth and power are necessarily superior to those in economic classes below them.  [49] Dominionists may argue with some credibility that they do believe in helping the poor; however, they want churches to undertake that task and adamantly fight against government social aid programs funded from tax monies—unless of course—it is a so-called “faith based” initiative. Pat Robertson forgot his objections to the government handing out money and gratefully accepted the $500,000 Mr. Bush sent him early in his administration for “good faith based charitable work.” Regardless of their protestations, however, the churches of America cannot and do not have the billions of dollars to provide the social safety net for the poor, elderly and sick among America’s population. In 1985, for example, Robertson bragged CBN gave $50 million worth of food, clothes, and supplies to 8.5 million people, but that was what he called “leveraged” contributions, in which CBN had joined with other charities. Robertson admitted they gave only $10 million. Deducting the $2 million of CBN’s contributions to the Contras in Central America, CBN’s total contribution amounted to only about eighty-eight cents to every hungry, needy person he said CBN helped.  [50] Pat Robertson wrote in The Secret Kingdom: “Unhappily, evangelical Christians have for too long reduced the born-again experience to the issue of being ‘saved.’ Salvation is an important issue, obviously, and must never be deemphasized. But rebirth must be seen as a beginning, not an arrival. It provides access to the invisible world, the kingdom of God, of which we are to learn and experience and then share with others. Jesus Himself said it clearly before His ascension: ‘All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.’ [Matthew 28:18-20 New American Standard Bible]. The commission was to make followers and learners—converts—and to teach them the principles of the kingdom. Entry into the body of believers was not enough. They were to learn how to live in this world…The invisible was to rule the visible. Christ has authority over both.” Emphasis is Robertson’s.

GOVERNMENT:  We reclaim freedom of religious expression in public on government property, and freedom from government interference. Support government display of Ten Commandments.  Dispel the "myth" of the separation of church and state. A strong and vibrant private sector [should be] unencumbered by excessive government regulation. Oppose Campaign Finance Reform.

						    By Paul Davidson, USA TODAY The Federal Communications Commission plans to propose a ruling Wednesday that would require Internet-based phone and broadband services to design their networks so they can be easily wiretapped, two FCC officials say.  The move is designed to resolve the Justice Department's fear that FCC plans to deregulate broadband could keep the FBI from monitoring the communications of criminals and terrorists, FCC officials say.   That's not an issue for most phone calls. The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) requires "telecommunications" carriers to make their networks wiretap-friendly.   But the law exempts "information services." And in 2002 the FCC ruled that cable's broadband offerings are information services. It also plans to put phone-company DSL services in that category.   Analysts and officials expect the information-service label to lead to further FCC rulings that exempt both cable and phone companies from obligations to open their broadband networks to rivals such as EarthLink and AOL.   Phone DSL providers are currently subject to open-access and CALEA rules; cable firms aren't.   Justice has said the information-service ruling could hamper its efforts to monitor criminals and terrorists. They increasingly make calls on broadband lines via Internet-based phone services.   The FCC plans to propose that CALEA rules apply to broadband and Internet-based phone services because they "substantially" replace traditional phone networks.  Internet-based phone providers, such as Vonage, as well as the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, which represents cable operators, say they don't oppose a requirement to make networks CALEA-compliant.   In exchange, analysts say, the FCC wants Justice's solicitor general to seek Supreme Court review of an appeals court ruling that struck down the FCC's decision to call cable broadband an "information service." That ruling could force cable services to open their broadband networks to rivals. The deadline for appeal is Aug. 30.  The FCC pro-wiretap proposal "certainly moves the ball in the right direction," says Legg Mason analyst Blair Levin.   But Medley Global Advisors analyst Jessica Zufolo calls the plan "a political effort to reach out to the law enforcement community."   Jim Dempsey of the Center for Democracy & Technology says the FCC is exceeding its authority because, "Congress decided the Internet should not be regulated."   The FCC is also expected to rule that walkie-talkie services, must comply with CALEA wiretap rules.

						    There is increasing evidence that U.S. doctors, nurses, and medics have been complicit in torture and other illegal procedures in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay. Such medical complicity suggests still another disturbing dimension of this broadening scandal.  We know that medical personnel have failed to report to higher authorities wounds that were clearly caused by torture and that they have neglected to take steps to interrupt this torture. In addition, they have turned over prisoners' medical records to interrogators who could use them to exploit the prisoners' weaknesses or vulnerabilities. We have not yet learned the extent of medical involvement in delaying and possibly falsifying the death certificates of prisoners who have been killed by torturers.  A May 22 article on Abu Ghraib in the New York Times states that "much of the evidence of abuse at the prison came from medical documents" and that records and statements "showed doctors and medics reporting to the area of the prison where the abuse occurred several times to stitch wounds, tend to collapsed prisoners or see patients with bruised or reddened genitals."1   According to the article, two doctors who gave a painkiller to a prisoner for a dislocated shoulder and sent him to an outside hospital recognized that the injury was caused by his arms being handcuffed and held over his head for "a long period," but they did not report any suspicions of abuse. A staff sergeant-medic who had seen the prisoner in that position later told investigators that he had instructed a military policeman to free the man but that he did not do so. A nurse, when called to attend to a prisoner who was having a panic attack, saw naked Iraqis in a human pyramid with sandbags over their heads but did not report it until an investigation was held several months later.  A June 10 article in the Washington Post tells of a long-standing policy at the Guantanamo Bay facility whereby military interrogators were given access to the medical records of individual prisoners.2 The policy was maintained despite complaints by the Red Cross that such records "are being used by interrogators to gain information in developing an interrogation plan." A civilian psychiatrist who was part of a medical review team was "disturbed" about not having been told about the practice and said that it would give interrogators "tremendous power" over prisoners.  Other reports, though sketchier, suggest that the death certificates of prisoners who might have been killed by various forms of mistreatment have not only been delayed but may have camouflaged the fatal abuse by attributing deaths to conditions such as cardiovascular disease.3  Various medical protocols - notably, the World Medical Association Declaration of Tokyo in 1975 - prohibit all three of these forms of medical complicity in torture. Moreover, the Hippocratic Oath declares, "I will use treatment to help the sick according to my ability and judgment, but never with a view to injury and wrongdoing."  To be a military physician is to be subject to potential moral conflict between commitment to the healing of individual people, on the one hand, and responsibility to the military hierarchy and the command structure, on the other. I experienced that conflict myself as an Air Force psychiatrist assigned to Japan and Korea some decades ago: I was required to decide whether to send psychologically disturbed men back to the United States, where they could best receive treatment, or to return them to their units, where they could best serve combat needs. There were, of course, other factors, such as a soldier's pride in not letting his buddies down, but for physicians this basic conflict remained.  American doctors at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere have undoubtedly been aware of their medical responsibility to document injuries and raise questions about their possible source in abuse. But those doctors and other medical personnel were part of a command structure that permitted, encouraged, and sometimes orchestrated torture to a degree that it became the norm - with which they were expected to comply - in the immediate prison environment.  The doctors thus brought a medical component to what I call an "atrocity-producing situation" - one so structured, psychologically and militarily, that ordinary people can readily engage in atrocities. Even without directly participating in the abuse, doctors may have become socialized to an environment of torture and by virtue of their medical authority helped sustain it. In studying various forms of medical  abuse, I have found that the participation of doctors can confer an aura of legitimacy and can even create an illusion of therapy and healing.  The Nazis provided the most extreme example of doctors' becoming socialized to atrocity.4 In addition to cruel medical experiments, many Nazi doctors, as part of military units, were directly involved in killing. To reach that point, they underwent a sequence of socialization: first to the medical profession, always a self-protective guild; then to the military, where they adapted to the requirements of command; and finally to camps such as Auschwitz, where adaptation included assuming leadership roles in the existing death factory. The great majority of these doctors were ordinary people who had killed no one before joining murderous Nazi institutions. They were corruptible and certainly responsible for what they did, but they became murderers mainly in atrocity-producing settings.  When I presented my work on Nazi doctors to U.S. medical groups, I received many thoughtful responses, including expressions of concern about much less extreme situations in which American doctors might be exposed to institutional pressures to violate their medical conscience. Frequently mentioned examples were prison doctors who administered or guided others in giving lethal injections to carry out the death penalty and military doctors in Vietnam who helped soldiers to become strong enough to resume their assignments in atrocity-producing situations.  Physicians are no more or less moral than other people. But as heirs to shamans and witch doctors, we may be seen by others - and sometimes by ourselves - as possessing special magic in connection with life and death. Various regimes have sought to harness that magic to their own despotic ends. Physicians have served as actual torturers in Chile and elsewhere; have surgically removed ears as punishment for desertion in Saddam Hussein's Iraq; have incarcerated political dissenters in mental hospitals, notably in the Soviet Union; have, as whites in South Africa, falsified medical reports on blacks who were tortured or killed; and have, as Americans associated with the Central Intelligence Agency, conducted harmful, sometimes fatal, experiments involving drugs and mind control.  With the possible exception of the altering of death certificates, the recent transgressions of U.S. military doctors have apparently not been of this order. But these examples help us to recognize what doctors are capable of when placed in atrocity-producing situations. A recent statement by the Physicians for Human Rights addresses this vulnerability in declaring that "torture can also compromise the integrity of health professionals."5  To understand the full scope of American torture and abuse at Abu Ghraib and other prisons, we need to look more closely at the behavior of doctors and other medical personnel, as well as at the pressures created by the war in Iraq that produced this behavior. It is possible that some doctors, nurses, or medics took steps, of which we are not yet aware, to oppose the torture. It is certain that many more did not. But all those involved could nonetheless reveal, in valuable medical detail, much of what actually took place. By speaking out, they would take an important step toward reclaiming their role as healers.  Source Information From the Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston.   References  1..

						    By PAUL KRUGMAN, NEW YORK TIMES  Published: July 30, 2004  Under the headline "Voters Want Specifics From Kerry," The Washington Post recently quoted a voter demanding that John Kerry and John Edwards talk about "what they plan on doing about health care for middle-income or lower-income people. I have to face the fact that I will never be able to have health insurance, the way things are now. And these millionaires don't seem to address that."  Mr. Kerry proposes spending $650 billion extending health insurance to lower- and middle-income families. Whether you approve or not, you can't say he hasn't addressed the issue. Why hasn't this voter heard about it?  Well, I've been reading 60 days' worth of transcripts from the places four out of five Americans cite as where they usually get their news: the major cable and broadcast TV networks. Never mind the details - I couldn't even find a clear statement that Mr. Kerry wants to roll back recent high-income tax cuts and use the money to cover most of the uninsured. When reports mentioned the Kerry plan at all, it was usually horse race analysis - how it's playing, not what's in it.   On the other hand, everyone knows that Teresa Heinz Kerry told someone to "shove it," though even there, the context was missing. Except for a brief reference on MSNBC, none of the transcripts I've read mention that the target of her ire works for Richard Mellon Scaife, a billionaire who financed smear campaigns against the Clintons - including accusations of murder. (CNN did mention Mr. Scaife on its Web site, but described him only as a donor to "conservative causes.") And viewers learned nothing about Mr. Scaife's long vendetta against Mrs. Heinz Kerry herself.  There are two issues here, trivialization and bias, but they're related.  Somewhere along the line, TV news stopped reporting on candidates' policies, and turned instead to trivia that supposedly reveal their personalities. We hear about Mr. Kerry's haircuts, not his health care proposals. We hear about George Bush's brush-cutting, not his environmental policies.   Even on its own terms, such reporting often gets it wrong, because journalists aren't especially good at judging character. ("He is, above all, a moralist," wrote George Will about Jack Ryan, the Illinois Senate candidate who dropped out after embarrassing sex-club questions.) And the character issues that dominate today's reporting have historically had no bearing on leadership qualities. While planning D-Day, Dwight Eisenhower had a close, though possibly platonic, relationship with his female driver. Should that have barred him from the White House?  And since campaign coverage as celebrity profiling has no rules, it offers ample scope for biased reporting.  Notice the voter's reference to "these millionaires." A Columbia Journalism Review Web site called campaigndesk.org, says its analysis "reveals a press prone to needlessly introduce Senators Kerry and Edwards and Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, as millionaires or billionaires, without similar labels for President Bush or Vice President Cheney."  As the site points out, the Bush campaign has been "hammering away with talking points casting Kerry as out of the mainstream because of his wealth, hoping to influence press coverage." The campaign isn't claiming that Mr. Kerry's policies favor the rich - they manifestly don't, while Mr. Bush's manifestly do. Instead, we're supposed to dislike Mr. Kerry simply because he's wealthy (and not notice that his opponent is, too). Republicans, of all people, are practicing the politics of envy, and the media obediently go along.  In short, the triumph of the trivial is not a trivial matter. The failure of TV news to inform the public about the policy proposals of this year's presidential candidates is, in its own way, as serious a journalistic betrayal as the failure to raise questions about the rush to invade Iraq.  P.S.: Another story you may not see on TV: Jeb Bush insists that electronic voting machines are perfectly reliable, but The St. Petersburg Times says the Republican Party of Florida has sent out a flier urging supporters to use absentee ballots because the machines lack a paper trail and cannot "verify your vote."  P.P.S.: Three weeks ago, The New Republic reported that the Bush administration was pressuring Pakistan to announce a major terrorist capture during the Democratic convention. Hours before Mr. Kerry's acceptance speech, Pakistan announced, several days after the fact, that it had apprehended an important Al Qaeda operative.
