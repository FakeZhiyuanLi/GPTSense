      Well this week is slowly making it's way to the end.&nbsp; It's Thursday now and I'm so tired already.&nbsp; Yesterday and the day before, I had worked 12 hours each day.&nbsp; I only do it every so often but when I do.....*whew*...it really drains me.&nbsp; Well with the weekend coming soon I will finally be able to take our cat to the vet.&nbsp; Not that it's important to anyone but me.&nbsp; Also I will probably start workin' on some more graff, it's been a few days since i've really tried to plug away at it so I think that will e my stress relief for the weekend.&nbsp; If anything interesting happens I'll be sure to post it....so until then.....

      So I got to start the day off with a good fight with my signifigant other.&nbsp; Apparently public vandalism isn't a good idea in your own apartment building....lol.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know she was right but it was just one of those things that I had to argue.&nbsp; Anyways all has been patched up and we're off to bigger and better things now.&nbsp; As for the vandalism...more specifically graffiti...if you haven't figured out by now its my preferred weapon of choice.&nbsp; in the near future I'll be sure to post up some pics of work thats been done by myself or other TOPS members.......Stay Tuned!

      Hi Everybody..........  So my birthdays comin in a couple weeks and I am very excited.  For 6 years i've been trying to go to Casino Niagara on my birthday....i've been before but theres a novelty of being there on my birthday that I just haven't been able to give up on.  So wish me luck as I go hit the slots and throw the dice and make my first million...haha I wish....The other big thing is I get to go down to see my best bud and most likely go paint the town red...literally...so i'm off for now and I'll try to get back and post my results at the casino along with maybe a pic or two....we'll see how I feel.
