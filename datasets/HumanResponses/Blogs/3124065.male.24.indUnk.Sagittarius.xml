       BANK HOLIDAY 'BONANZA'!   Here's what's been happening in the world this bank holiday weekend. (Note: Some of the following material may be familiar to those who have had the displeasure to have visited the old BaronSaladBack site which has now been abandoned like an unwanted pet on an electronic street corner. New and pointless crap will be  available shortly)  Chris   WASP CONFERENCE CALLED OFF.   The yearly gathering of the insect worlds biggest and brightest was called off today as a mark of respect to those mullered in the recent slug pellet tragedy. The conference, which is made up of wasps from around the country, was supposed to discuss foreign politics and the future of the honey market. Wasp minister Steven Sting said, “The conference will go ahead sometime in the near future but for now we have decided to fly around stinging random children”    ‘BIRCHFIELD’ PREMIERES TONIGHT!    The longly awaited sitcom dubbed by many as  ‘The British ‘Friends’ is being shown on Channel Four at nine p.m. tonight. The show, written and produced by creative team Tim Chips, Raymond Silk and Debra McNuggets, centres on a group of young people who live and work in the picturesque town of Oldbury. The show marks a first for British Television as the series weighs in at hefty fifty-six and a half episodes.  Channel Four has faith in the series and hopes it will boost their Thursday comedy night which has so far been clogged up with repeats of ‘Fraiser’ and the dire sock puppet comedy ‘You need hands’. Tim Chips and his cohorts believe the success of the show will be down to the young and enthusiastic cast who have had little break through success thus far. “We wanted to cast unknowns” Says Debra “We didn’t want to cast big names because we felt it wouldn’t work if it was a star driven show. Plus, it’s cheaper” To find the five characters Tim, Debra and Raymond cast their nets across the nation. It took six months of auditions with over one million eager people to find their future stars. Here’s the low down:  Frances Lowenbrow ‘Fran’ Star of the popular sitcom ‘The Grimsby’s’ and ‘Animal Husbandry’ Frances is the most familiar face of the bunch. Trained in stage acting and monkey training, Frances plays ‘Fran’ the new girl in town who moves in with the cast.  “She’s a bit of a mystery” Frances said of her character “She’s a little vulnerable, a tad naïve and sensitive but if pushed she’ll suddenly snap and attack you with a hammer!”   Rachel Edmunds ‘Rachel’ Rachel Edmunds was born into a musical family and enjoyed brief success with her girl group ‘Lady Shapes’ who scaled the charts in the early nineties with songs like ‘The Chickens are restless’, ‘Don’t stop (even at red lights)’ and ‘Bargain Basement Baby’ Rachel has a degree in woodwork.  She plays Rachel, the less suspicious member of the group. “Rachel is nothing like me” She laughs “She swears like a trooper!”   Gavin Rock ‘Gav’ Gavin Ulysses-Rock was spotted at a small comedy club in Leeds where he was performing his surreal stand up show, ‘Gavin a laugh’. Growing up in Wolverhampton Gavin (or Havin to close friends) dreamt of becoming the first drunken Englishman on the moon. His move into comedy was accidental but has paved the way for his first major role as Gav, the quick-witted office worker in ‘Birchfield’. “My character is always there with a quip or two” Gavin Says “I think viewers will relate to him”   Samantha Chi-Chi ‘Sam’ Samantha is familiar to eagle eyed viewers of ‘Oldbury City’, ‘Senile Witness’ and ‘Loughbough’s Burning’ where she played a variety of different corpses. She has also appeared in various pantomimes’s across the country. Samantha Plays Sam a plucky young waitress prone to breaking out into song. Watch out for a series of musical numbers complete with big brass bands and high kicking ladies.   Chris Batenhead ‘Chris’ Chris Batenhead, a first time actor, plays Chris the witty yet mentally challenged room mate who gets himself into all sorts of scrapes and adventures just by turning up to work. Chris, a former Olympic owl trainer landed the role by chance. On his character Chris has this to say, “Fundamentally, Chris is a character in which the viewer can laugh at and share great amusement. He is a jester who adds a touch of slapstick to the programme. He is nothing like me at all, I’m glad to say.”    Catch the first episode on Channel Four tonight at 9pm.

       THE BEAST OF HAMMERSTRIKE   Hammerstrike, a small town on the very edge of Southern England. Not much happens here. The residents of this town that time forgot live in harmony. Crime hasn't been invented yet.  The villagers simple lives are detached from the hussle and bussle of the city. This is a town where everybody knows everybody. Hammerstrike has recently been won The Utopia Award for the tenth year running. Hammerstrike is a town of peace....that was until this week. Where harmony was barged aside by the large and disturbing shoulder of fear.  The Beast Of Hammerstrike, first captured on shaky camcorder by some old woman filming couples on the Beden Meadow. It has sent shockwaves of fear down the naive spines of the residents and brought unwanted attention from the worlds media. The footage shows a large cat like animal prowling the moors possibly looking for a man/woman/woodpecker to feast on. Boffins claim that the beast is nothing more than an escaped puma called Percy who fled his captors at Drayton Manor some months ago.  Horrice Morris, 34 says otherwise. He, like a growing number of smalltown simpletons, has claimed to have seen the beast first hand. I probed him about this and the following words tumbled from his mouth.  HORRICE: 'I was making good with my legs a few days ago across Gormless Creek when a large, shadow crossed my path. I thought nothing of it until it emerged a few moments later and stopped right in front of me. I just froze. I didn't know what to do. I remained calm and tried not to startled it. It was a magnificent thing, very graceful and big. It walked on all fours at first but after a while it stood on its back legs and extened itself to about six feet. I think it was trying to establish it's territory.'  INTERVIEWER: 'What did you do then?'  HORRICE: 'I, uh, regret to say that I wet myself. That seemed to scare it off. You're not going to mention this are you?'  Beast or no, Hammerstrike is hot right now. Papers are running wild with the story and the mystery deepens.  More soon

       YES, BUT HOW ARE YOUR TESTICLES?   Sadly, I have been struck down with mumps. Yes, I, a 24 year old man, has been knocked down flat by a kids illness. It has also given me the jawline of an old He-Man figure. I look a lot like Chandler in the eight season of Friends. Do you remember that period? When he looked a lot like Micheal Douglas and his head was so big he had to attach it to his neck with small wieghts to stop it rolling off and crushing the stick-like Courtney Cox?  I look kind of like that but not as quirky. So I haven't been up to much. I've been slowly going insane indoors, surfing the net and trying to keep myself entertained. I'm waiting for my face to go back to it's original shape before I do anything social.  Oh, and my testicles are fine. A lot of people have asked me that. "I have mumps, Mom"  "Oh, you poor dear. How are your testicles?" "-----" "Are they big?" "So, whats the weather like in Cyprus?" I didn't know that if your nuts swell up there is a good chance that the illness can effect your ability to have kids. I have kept a close on them and nothing is out of the ordinary.  Chris   OTHER NEWS    THE TOP FIVE    1. WHINEY TALENTLESS MONEY GRUBBING TART - 'F U RIGHT BACK' (Ohh, get me!) - Silly, big ear-ringed, former fuck pig of equally talentless potato head Eamon spills 'the beans' on their 'relationship' with this 'tell all' song. It's the ultimate revenge for both her and 'sista hood' not only does she really stick it to him, she also pays him royalties for using his song. Girl Power!  2. WHINEY TALENTLESS POTATO HEAD - 'Fuck it! I don't Want You Back' With a face only his mother would love and a head that could stop time, you have to feel for this particular breed of idiot, not only did his girly-girl leave him she broke his heart too. He wants to tell you about it. 'Fuck You, You Ho!' he whimpers. Hardly Bob Dylan, is he? Fuck it, he's no Peter Andre either and HE'S someone who should know pain---he dates Jordan.  3. THE AMAZING CRAB LADDER BAND - 'STOOLS' - A new entry. Features backing vocals by Norah Jones and Stella Artois. Marvellous!  4. BRITNEY SPEARS - 'Oooh, Fill My Void' (With Your Love)- Britney and her 18 man team of writers have crafted this suggestive ballad and aimed at the kiddie market.  5. UNFATHOMABLY POPULAR MALE POP PUPPET #2332 - THE SOUNDS OF SCREAMING WOMEN - Also soundtracks the new Macdonalds ad. Both make you want to vomit on your own chest.

       CHAKABOBO! THAT'S THE SOUND OF PARROT JAZZ!   This week DEXTER VON DUTCH goes to Amsterdam to uncover the new musical genre that is freaking out the beatniks and beating out the freaks. It's the sound of PARROT JAZZ.  "In a small, musty club on Horse-Varnish Avenue, Amsterdam a small revolution is taking place. It's not punk. Punks dead, everyone knows that (except John Lydon and the Americans) and it comes from an unlikely source. It appears that our new musical hero isn’t some twenty something with greased hair and a drug problem but in fact a small, feathered creature whose breed  are mostly famous for sitting on pirates shoulders and sitting in cages bashing their heads against mirrors. Beaks Mcfee is the Cole Porter of the Parrot Jazz scene. He is, what the jazz freaks would call, the 'Sho-daddy beef queen' which means that Beaks is something of a legend before his time. Beaks developed his skills while flapping around his owners music shop. The little fellow became attracted to wind instruments after falling into a trumpet. From that day forward, Beaks would practice mastering the sax until the wee small hours. "I would hone, man" he says as he takes another sip of his favourite coffee "I would play and play until I could no longer PLAY the sax...I could FEEL it" Beaks then went on to perform at the local jazz and blues bars 'The Kinky', 'Club Oooh!' and 'Bar Maaaaaan' would all play host to this winged prodigy. It wasn't long until his star was in ascendance. Beaks garnered glowing reviews and wowed audiences wherever he played. He is now on the verge of completing his first album 'Cuttle Fish Special'. He vows that the album will encompass all that makes him the talent he is "This album" he says calmly "Will jazz your face off" It seems that this bird has taken flight. Watch this space.

       GUIDE TO THE WEB   HISTORY-  The Intenet was originally designed as another way for advertisers to sell their wares but it has developed into a place where people can set up websites and be feel smug with themselves. It's a text based community where everybody wants to talk to you (espsually if you pretend to be an 18 year old bi-sexual cheerleader) However- The internet isn't just about fun and 'logging off' to pornographic images from www.eroticpandas.com. For a hapless first timer The 'web' can suck you in and spit you out. It can be dangerous, very dangerous. Oh yes. If you don't believe me I suggest you re-watch the recent 'Sarah-Louise Platt  Vs Chat Room Monster' episode of 'Cornation Street'. I have it on tape should you have foolishly missed the classic episode (It's right up there with the 'Duckworth Pigeon Saga') Watch it and learn.  Here are some sites I recommend:  www.mymomlookslikesomeoneelsesmom.com This is rather amusing website where U.S teens swap and guffaw at images of their mother who happen to look like someone elses mother. Funnier than it sounds.  www.itsnotliketheolddays.co.uk Old people are funny. Read some of their ramblingly incoherant stories.  www.geocities.com/continuityerrorproductions Some website. Leave a message on the Guestbook so they'll get the hint and update it. Plus, it will make them think you like them. Now includes XXX pictures of Chris doing the funky Gibbon.   www.eroticpandas.com *ahem*  www.franssmuthut.co.uk A collection of filthy stories, poems and dirty jokes.  www.whatstheoutsideworldlooklikeandcanitharmme.com Website for people who live their lives in front of a PC screen playing roll playing games all day.   www.hearthembuggerscheep.co.uk Website ran by Greg Fist a crazy 80 year old who has thousands of budgies which he keeps in his battered avary in Southampton. Greg likes to make them say amusing words and you can hear them LIVE on the net. Hear Bluey say 'Twat' and Polly the parrot squawk out a string of dirty words so foul they would make Chubby Brown blush.   www.whoaeasynow.co.uk Richard Turps, a young office worker exposes work innuendo for the world to hear (Site contains pitiful flirty and footage of fifty year old account managers sitting awkardly on the corner of their young secretary's desk)   www.sendthemafistintheface.co.uk Dislike someone? Hate them just by their brash websites filled with cock awful melodrama? Want to send them a stinging intenet slap in the mush? Log onto here and show someone you DONT care. The latest updates see Dark Nation, Micheal Winner and the host of www.woodyallenisrubbish.com getting the slapping they deserve!    www.hootieB.co.uk Website dedicated to a girl with a strange name and penchant for big nosed boys with crap websites.   www.isthatwhatIthinkitis.com Yes, it is.   www.heyheyitstherock.co.uk Pictures of a young man dancing around Wolverhampton and pulling girls. (Note- This site contains a level of charm most of us only dream about. Site also contains people putting their thumbs up and saying 'Quality' a lot)

       GAY CELEBRITIES LEFT REELING IN  IN, OUT SHAKE IT ALL ABOUT FANDANGO   The celebrity world was left reeling yesterday when several homosexual stars suddenly stopped being gay. A host of stars including George from Rainbow handed in their little pink notices and resigned from the exclusive club, which has millions of members "Being gay simply isn't the big thing anymore" said George "It's become too commercial."  Homosexuality has been around since man first slithered out of the ooze and has become a happy alternative to going out with moody girls. Oscar Wilde, Liberace and Queen singer Freddy Mercury have all been part of this culture that has had many image changes over recent decades. At first prudes declared gay people as 'disgusting' and 'Unnatural' but in this liberated age of tolerance and understanding the world has embraced homosexuals and warmed to their care free ways. However, is the world ready for stars to hang up their gay ways and go straight? The recent 'inning's' of several major celebrities has rocked the showbiz world leaving the question 'Is Gay cool?' hanging over our heads like some kind of lesbian albatross.  The sudden scramble to be straight again has been noticeable in celebrity circles for months. In one instance very gay actor Michael Tennis went from super gay to slightly gay in just under a week. He was then spotting 'chatting up' a woman in New York. When faced with this question at a recent premiere Tennis remarked, "What I do in my time is my own business. If you parasites spent more time reporting actual news instead of digging up any old tripe about celebrities you would earn the right to call yourself a Newspaper" Michael’s pint sized agent Les Rowe remarked that Tennis was "under a lot of stress" and had "been seeing women for research purposes"  Another celebrity converted back and forth so many times that he vanished.  "I can't see these people staying 'in' for long" said gay journalist Peter Batter "Women are like fireworks, they look pretty but if they're not handled properly they'll go off in your bloody face"    MASSIVE TURN OUT FOR CLOWN BURIAL   The circus world closed its doors for a day to bury one of its most popular entertainers. Charlie Chuckles was given an emotional send off by friends, family and fans alike. Charlie (real name Martin Green) was killed in a vicious ‘Splat and run’ incident in the early hours of Friday morning. The police have not yet named any suspects but they believe it was a rival circus gang who resented Charlie’s appearance on ‘Parkinson’.  The ceremony featured Charlie’s coffin carried by pantomime horses and a one hundred custard pie salute was given after the burial.  Charlie’s widow Scarlet the world’s hairiest woman choked back tears as she told us “Charlie would have been proud of the turn out. Everyone has made today’s service a fitting tribute to a terrific man”  His former agent and manager Barry Bigot said, “Charlie had a heart of gold. He lived only to entertain. He’s gone but not forgotten. The circus world will be lost without him”  The BBC will be broadcasting repeats of his early nineties television variety show “Charlie’s Bigtop of fun” as part of a tribute night which will also feature his appearances on Byker Grove, Blue Peter, Parkinson and The Time, The Place.

       YOU CAN’T PLEASE EVERYONE    The recent pledge to clean up Britain’s towns has been met with obvious glee from it’s many citizens but also distain from a large potion of the country.  For and against parties recently nudged aside the crazed evangelists and buskers of Wolverhampton City Centre and put their views and concerns forward. We sent down confused reporter Chandler Oxtail to investigate further.  Litter. It’s not good. It attracts vermin and it tarnishes Britain. It is a problem the government have vowed to resolve. Last week, Tony Blair took time out from playing Risk with George Bush to impart an emotional message to the bewildered public.  The gist was that it’s time for Britain to clean up and become ‘a proud nation of clean and honest people’  Vocal chest beaters filled shopping centres to shout loudly at passers by and wave badly spelt banners at them. Here in the centre of Wolverhampton are two opposing parties, ready to rumble over this latest hot news potato.   ‘Litter isn’t pretty’ blurts Peter Crump, leader of Keep Things Neat ‘I think that the government are taking giant and mature steps in the battle against filth and this will benefit everyone, old and young’  Not everyone sees it this way. In fact, pointless pro- litter party ‘Shit-hole UK’ see it as ‘an infringement of civil liberties’. Head honcho Arthur Skat agreed to chat with me in an empty skip.  What you got against cleanliness?  Arthur: ‘I think it’s nothing more than a façade, people are too hung up on image and it’s not about that. It’s about what’s inside that counts and what’s inside us all is messy guts. That’s how our cities should be’  But surely cleaner streets are safer streets? Filth caused the great plague.  Arthur, stuck for a response, decided that spinning around in a circle and humming would best answer the question. It was at this point that I decided to leave.   We’d like to hear your thoughts on this issue. You can leave your blabs in the comments section.  ‘Baron Salad Back’ is another curly hair on the broad chest of the World Wide Web

       BUSH DENIES, DENIES, DENIES!   Hapless, gun-loving, ill mannered, high-powered buffoon President 'Boom Boom' Bush has sternly denied reports that coalition forces forced Iraq POW's to partake in a humiliating version of knockabout game show 'Takeshi's Castle' currently hosted by so-so funny man Craig 'Ghost Watch'&nbsp;Charles. &nbsp;One toothless simpleton Captain Kirk Murk was overheard chuckling about one particular POW falling A over T whilst indulging in a round of 'Bridge Ball' a particular favourite round from the popular T.V show. Investigators are also prodding the armed forces over allegations that prisoners were made to perform a full version of cult stage show 'Rocky Horror' "No comment" has been the original response thus far.&nbsp; Bush pretended not to hear the question and carried on with his colouring in.    NEWS JUST IN!   Sky One have brought the rights to show 'Those Wacky Iraq's' a knockabout game show filmed on digital cameras in disused buildings.&nbsp; "This could fit right in our schedule of repeats of The Simpson’s and When Holiday Reps Have Sex" said some man in a suit.

      All is well in the land of Bate.&nbsp; The film is rolling along nicely by all accounts and casting has begun. Not sure if I'll be a physical participant during the filming in October but as long as it gets&nbsp;made then I'm happy as Larry (Whoever he is) More interesting posts may happen soon. There's a lot going on in my head at the moment. Things are shifting at a fast rate. People are moving on and moving out, some people are just getting stranger and stranger. At least it's not dull.
