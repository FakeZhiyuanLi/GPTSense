      Ok, I really like the feeling I got after posting something quasi-positive ;) I'm gonna alternate the crappy more negative stuffs with nice things. Sounds corny, but it lessens the chance of me spiraling into a constant stream of negativity/cynicism.  Woo! Woo!  Oh, I thought I might explain DemonGund, while I was at it. Ok, anyone familiar with the stuffed animal company  Gund ? Well, long ago someone kept putting a Gund rabbit-thing on my computer. So having a Demon Gund was my jab at them. ha ha ha. If I had known that I'd have to explain the meaning for the next 10 years, I woulda chose something a little more generic. John392849123758734589741834905849058@hotmail.com maybe?

      For hours the moonlight streamed through the ancient warped-glass of the second story windows. Thin to the point of transparency the white curtains flowed around the panes, moved by the summer breeze. The breeze is a sweet one, not the usual stagnant wind-across-asphalt scent, as this one is nurtured by the large trees filling the yard outside the house. The light pollution from the rest of the city is blocked completely by those trees... the only light let through is the moonlight and a bright yellow glare from a streetlight. This is when it would start.  It was felt before heard. The window panes shudder... the entire house would rock... Gently though, not at all rough. Then.... with the rain... It  comes.  The Train.  Heavy. Immense. Impossible long. The resounding of it's passing have begun. Clicky-clack... clicky-clack... The mood of the conductor would determine whether the Train sounded. Was it the same conductor from all those years ago? When the children would line the street pumping their arms in an effort to coax a few bellows from the engine. If not, it is him in spirit, as only those same children exist now. It sounds.  The Train continues.  The lullaby is deep and repetitive played by metal wheels pounding track, steel, gravel, rock, earth. The trees feel it, the wind feels it, the House feels it and in turn massages everything inside. It is a lullaby touching everything. Clicky-clack... into every crevice... clicky-clack... into every nitch... clicky-clack... into every thought... clicky-clack... clicky-clack...  Sleep.

      Figured I'd compile a list of stuff to look at while at work. I only have one requirement: only read these when you are actively screwing off at work (I.E. getting paid, on the clock etc):   urlLink www.fark.com      8 Bit Theater     urlLink MegaTokyo     urlLink The Best Page in the Universe   I'll probably add more later but if you're dedicated, these few links should fill up a months worth of unproductive time!

      So, Ken Kesey's book Demon Box has a bunch of short stories mostly revolving around Oregon. It is so STRANGE to read his perspective on everyday Oregonian life... I remember doing the catfish fishing in a pond, running through the woods and all that stuff. Something about reading his experiences with the same events is eerie. Wow, I could just write down all the random stories I remember from my childhood and be able to analyze them with a mature mind. I'm not comparing myself to Kesey!! Don't get me wrong.. let me give you an example of where I'm going with this tirade: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My mother, stepfather and I joined my stepfather's friend and nephews on a camping trip. The two nephews and I went off to explore Sharp's Creek a bit while the adults drank beer and played with the campfire. About a quarter-mile upriver we climbed down an embankment wandered a little ways then climbed back up again. This all would have been very uneventful if I had been a better climber. Unfortunately, I climbed slower than the other two. This, oddly enough, lead to them throwing rocks down at me to hurry me up (counter-productive? I think so). Anyway, a rock pushed down dislodged a BIG rock, which promptly landed on my head. Ouch. So, hazy eyed (and not feeling any pain), we walked back to camp. By the time we got back, the entire back of my jean jacket was soaked with blood coming out of my skull. My mother's response: "Ummm, hey Bud (stepdad), should we take him to the hospital" stepdad: "You going to be okay, BOY?" At this point I had everyone in camp looking at me like "Shit, the hospital is a 45 minute drive away, he better not fuckin' say yes". So maybe it was the loss of blood that made me give in to their crap guilt trip.... but I said "No" like a good passive son should. -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Now, instead of simply telling the story verbally and getting a general response of "Man, that sucks" I want this to go differently. But.. I don't rightly know what to do. I still get worked up thinking about it, all the things I would've or should've done differently. Anyway, here's the first in my installment of Oregon Memories. When I figure out what step follows 1) Write the memory down.... I'll let you know.

      Hmm... a road trip to Reno reading Ken Kesey has left me a bit meditative... I'll make this quick.  Ok, I think I found my biggest beef with large cities (at least ones in Oregon, seeing as how I've never really had experience in large cities in other states.. but I'll address this shortly... ok, I'll end the parenthesis now). Adversity and a slight bit of challenge cause growth.. well, if you have a Wal-Mart, Starbucks, Safeway, Blockbuster Video, movie theater, a job, and a 24 hour Sherries within 2 blocks of your home... would you ever have any inclination to do a goddamn thing? The average answer is probably "Well, of course I would!" ... only because noone would ever want to admit that they actually wouldn't. If I were to ask this question of any one of my friends and receive the "Well, of course I would!" response, I'd promptly setup video surveillance gear.. then, 20 years later when they're still in Eugene doing NOTHING I'd show them the 20 years worth of video, announcing that it was all time they'd never get back again.  It was a special combination of events that lead to my leaving Eugene. My girlfriend asked if I would ever consider moving somewhere else, "Sure." (my usual response) Would I consider purchasing a house, "Sure." Then ... I did some math. I added up how much money I had spent on RENT my entire life (I started paying rent at 15, long story, mebbe I'll say something about it later). Funny thing about me is that I get worked up more about numbers that normal emotional situations. Needless to say, after adding up all the money I had sent to landlords... I was GOING to move, SOON. So, after moving I can look at Eugene from a distance (hooking back into the previous paragraph).  I think business people and people in marketing are REALLY good at what they do. Which is: Get people to quit saving money. Lets build cities in such a way that people are looked DOWN upon for saving. Capitalist paradise.

      There is no better ego booster than moving from the city to a small town. I moved from a city where half a college education, advanced computer skills, a good job history, and charisma amounted to NOTHING. There were just so many goddamn people there that it was cake to find someone better qualified (probably why the Japanese are so pressured to kick ass at everything). So... instead of rising to the challenge of being a better person... I bought a house in a tiny podunk town where people with skills like mine are celebrities! Sweet!  You can type (try  urlLink MUD ding for 2 or 3 years..) !? You can use a computer!? You've been to a  urlLink college !?  Needless to say, I'm happy where I am now. Maybe more on this later.
