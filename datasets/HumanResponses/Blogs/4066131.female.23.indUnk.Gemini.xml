         Finally, after much deliberation I disregard the risk and took the plunge. Yes, I heartily succumb to my desire and surprise, supreise, it wasn't so painful after all. In fact, I actually enjoyed it. Oh yeah, I am loving every moment of it--I cannot believe that I ever had doubts of doing it. First thing that comes to mind is, would I be "good" at it? Would my awkwardness show? But then again, that is why there is such a word as "practice" right? As they say, practice makes perfect (and, oh boy am I looking forward to those "practices")--Darn, was I glad I did it! It is simply pure joy--magical would be more like it! It was like two souls merging in one body, two hearts beating as one! I find it hard to believe that I could do "these" things and be actually proud of myself. Now, I cannot stop to think of ways on how to do it. I could actually let my feelings flow and not be afraid of it. I discover a new side of me that I didn't know existed.               My very first blog entry--what a delight!!!

       --aLiaS--      It's not because I religiously watch the show (w/c of course I do)   It's not because I'm a fan of Jennifer Garner (w/c of course I am)   It's not because I go 'gaga' over Michael Vartan (whom I love btw)   It's certainly not because I adore spy daddy Jack's character (hhmm, those deadpan looks)      It's not because I just LOVE to hate Sark (and Sloane too)   It's definitely not because I missed Irina Derevko (w/c I certainly do)   Neither It's because I could relate to Sydney Bristow's double life (hhmm...)   Ok, Let me try that again...      Maybe...It's because I think, Im Sydney Bristow!!! (yeah right!)   Meaning, I'm a double agent spy?!?!? (of course not)   Or I have a Michael Vaughn in my life??? (yeah, I Wish)   None of those things mention above, I assure you (but, that doesn't mean I didn't wish for it)      It's simply because I think I live a double LIFE!   Oopps.. that didn't come out right...      What I meant is that, there's a side of me that I always held back...   I can't seem to let go the real me in front of others...   I laugh even when my heart is breaking....   I dismissed things as a non-entity even if it meant the world to me...      I've got so much doubts, angst, dreams...   w/c I just can't seem to share to others...   I am so afraid to let go of my feelings, so afraid to be judged...   So afraid to let go of my sensible side and be branded as 'emotional'...      Yeah, I'm a coward!   I refused to acknowledge that other person inside of me..   That tiny voice whose struggling to be free...      I guess, I'll have to live my double life now...   I have to go back to my tough facade...   And just ignore that little person inside...   Whose pleading to be let go.. and live the life of a FREE man      Damn, it's past 10 now.. I 'missed' ALIAS!!!

        I don't know what's wrong w/ me...    But lately I'm feeling a bit restless...   And I guess,  empty!        Urgh!!! This is really frustrating me! I'm writing this blog because I  so  wanted to analyze or at the very least... understand what I'm feeling but I just can't! Damn! I can't even convey in words the things/thoughts that's bothering me right now!       Or maybe... just maybe... a minute part of me doesn't really want to delve deeper into my thoughts and feelings.       Yeah, I guess I'm afraid again...      Afraid of what I might found out....
