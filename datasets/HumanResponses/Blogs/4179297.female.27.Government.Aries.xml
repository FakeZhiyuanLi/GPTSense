      I found out last night that I will be moving shifts at work.  This is depressing news,  as I adore the folks I work with now.  We get along so well and know how to work with each other.  Not trying to say too much in the negative about my reassignment, BUT....  Have you ever ran into people who just don't like anyone unless they're cute, drive a cool car, or have money oozing out their ears?  The ones who are so negative about most anything unless it involves something good for them?  That's this crew....well, with the exception of one.  Well, I'm cute (I think).  But I am a big woman, so that marks points against me where these folks are concerned.  My car is not cool at all.  (10 year old Toyota Tercel that has blue smoke to match the blue paint) And since I support myself and my disabled mother who lives with me, I don't exactly have money oozing out of my ears.   I'm trying to keep a positive attitude about the whole thing, though.  One of my current shift members who has more supervisory experience than I do told me to try to go into it with a clean mental slate and not to hold grudges about problems with those shift members in the past.   I believe that is certainly valuable advice.  A little difficult to do, but still good advice.  A few months back I had mentioned that I would make a shift change if needed to try to help alleviate some of the problems that come from that group.  I didn't really expect it to happen so soon!  So I suppose I will be hitting the bookstore today before work to find some books on personality types, management strategies, etc.   At least one thing went well yesterday!  The dentist appointment wasn't even half as bad as I expected it to be.  It took longer for the anesthetic to work its magic than it did to complete the procedure itself.  My appointment was at 2pm, and by 2:30 I was driving home!  Today my jaw is a bit sore at the injection site.  I guess that's a small price to pay for a tooth that is now more aesthetically pleasing, durable, and complete.  Oh yeah...Seems as if Tampa might get blown away before I get to my vacation.  I've been keeping up a little more than usual with the Weather Channel since Hurricane Charley is headed directly for my hotel room in Apollo Beach.  This is par for the course for my run of luck.  She certainly isn't a lady with me!  Off to Barnes and Noble to spend even more money on books I probably won't complete!  (Oh shit.  I just realized it's Friday, the 13th!)

      Ugh. I have a dentist's appointment this afternoon. They're going to fix a tooth that I chipped on a piece of fried okra, of all things. When I was there for my cleaning a couple of weeks ago, the good doctor mentioned that he could probably repair my chipped tooth without having to use anesthetic.  Yeah.  Wonder what brand of crack he started smoking?!  I mean, really! I'm certainly a chicken where the dentist is concerned, but not as bad as some. One of my friends gets his dentist to use nitrous for a routine cleaning. Hopefully things won't ever be that bad for me! Unfortunately I've been blessed with the curse of being completely honest. There I was in the dentist's chair whining, "Oh, no! Please use the shots! I'm such a chicken, but I don't care to admit it! Please use some Novacaine!" To make me feel like less of a moron, the dentist said that he, too, was a big ol' chicken. Hey, he gets points for at least trying to make me not feel like a dumbass!  Speaking of not getting shots at the dentist, there is an awesome book I finished not too long ago called   urlLink A Million Little Pieces .  This book is by far, one of the best I've read in a long time. It's a brutally honest and painful account of James Frey's stint in rehab. He's 23 and has been an alcoholic for ten years and has been huffing paint, snorting coke and smoking crack for three years. I don't want to talk too much about it because you can read reviews on the link. Trust me, it's well worth the time. (You'll understand the dentist reference not too far into it.)  Okay, I've procrastinated long enough. My work stuff is due this evening, so I'm going to get cracking on it before I get sleepy.

      After reading a few blogs over the years, and since my  urlLink best friend  recently started one, I decided it was time I get one, too.  Kudos to Kelly for her MANY ideas!  To let you know a bit about me, I am a 27 year-old single white female who lives in the Bible-thumping region of these here United States called  urlLink Chatsworth, Georgia .  It's a small town that is rather uneventful, but we are in between Chattanooga, TN (30 miles north) and Atlanta, GA (about 80 miles south).  Whenever there's a craving for "city life," we usually head south.  For good shopping, we typically head north. (Even though TN sales tax is highway robbery at almost 10%!)  My mother, my dog (a beautiful Sheltie named Sierra), hamster (uh.....a brown one I call Woodrow), and I all share an apartment.  It's certainly cramped and frustrating most of the time, but it's home.  I have been looking for a house to buy for the last several months.  It seems like every time I get excited about one, something happens that I can't get it.  I either get outbid,  the house is cute outside but falling apart inside, or it's 35 miles from my work, etc.  I'm sure anyone who has bought a house before knows the frustration.  I have never been married and have no kids.  I don't want to be married, either.  I have seen too many strong, smart, ballsy, and wonderful women turned into a weak, emotionally unstable, and depressed shell of a human being all in the name of "making a marriage work."  I don't see how arguing 24/7 and hating the person you're supposed to be with forever is any better than being single!    I work as a supervisor in a local 911 center.  I've been there a little over three years, and have been a supervisor since February 2004.  We dispatch law enforcement, fire departments, ambulances, as well as take all 911 emergency calls as well as the majority of non-emergency calls. We handle about 115,000 calls for service each year, and that workload is divided amongst four shifts.  I work nights and LOVE my job.  It's wonderful because I'm making sure someone's day is going to be better because of the help I've sent them.   By definition, I am considered to be a BBW.  For those of you not familiar with the acronym, it means  big beautiful woman.   I am 5'8" and proportioned, so I believe I carry it well.  I have  urlLink numerous freckles, fair skin, grey eyes, and short choppy blonde/brown highlighted hair .  Recently I have been trying to get a bit of a tan because I am going to  urlLink Tampa  in about two weeks.  It's slow getting super-pale freckled skin to tan.  Apparently I am going to be doomed to turning into a broiled lobster on the beach.....I don't think my tan will be ready by vacation time.  For those of you who keep up with astrology (if there are any), I am an Aries.  I am a true Arian except that I am nowhere near being considered an athlete.  Even if my body were in better shape, I still would suck at sports.  I could never do better than 160 on the golf course.  I had the prerequisite bicycle as a child, but as I got older and busier, that hobby just kinda went away.  On the Keirsey Temperament sorter, I score as an  urlLink ENFP . I like  urlLink good books ,  urlLink Academy Award-winning  and  urlLink nominated movies , cooking, good conversation, having nights out with friends, comedy clubs, concerts, plays, and any other typical-but-not-sports-related activities.  I have strong convictions when it comes to members of ethnic groups, alternate sexual lifestyles, and any other thing that would make a person "not normal."  I have very strong opinions on how the country is on a downward spiral since there is a Wal-Mart on every corner, (thereby putting small business out of business for a dollar) congress is trying to legislate morality, and how some folks think it's acceptable to try to throw  around "Bible-based" beliefs while hating people who are different from them.  Is it just me, or is that quite hypocritical?  Is hating people because they're different from you what Jesus would do? No, you say? Then take off that damned bracelet!!! A diatribe on that will follow in a later entry...I can't use up everything I like to fuss about in my first entry!  Golly geez, it's late....I've got to get some work stuff done.  Thanks for taking the time to read about me! I hope you'll be back for more later on!
