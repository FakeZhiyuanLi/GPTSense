						   Life is truly a wondrous thing when the right people are involved.  Last night for instance, I got home after a fairly involved day to find that my wife, Christy, was feeling wiped and frustrated about the lack of decent food in our household and restless to go out.  This was ok by me, although I was pretty wiped too and didn't want to go well out of our way just to grab a bite, which I was feeling more and more like I needed right then.  Fortunately we are going away for the weekend.  I say fortunately at this point because last night was the only night that one of our friends could come over to go through household responsibilities.  I thought back on it this morning and had to shake my head in wonder.  Time it was when I was the one going over to review household procedures for other "Grown Ups", now I have a wonderful wife who is arranging for people to watch over our place while we are away.  Does that make me a "Grown Up" too?  Hmmm.  Well, the reason for the watch care while we are gone is because of our dear cats Babee' and Tristan.  They are usually pretty good about fending for themselves; however there is always the inevitable cat box.  Everything else would be easily maintained, but Babee' and Tristan are very particular about a freshly scooped bathroom.  Guess I really can't blame them for that.  I would likely be the same way.  So, we needed a willing volunteer to watch over our furry felines whilst we schlepped down to TN for my brother, Stan, and his wife to be, Genevieve's, wedding.  And the point of this whole discourse is to say that Jamie, our friend and loyal help in time of trouble, was coming over @ 9:00pm to go through protocol with Christy and me.  (Well, mostly Christy.)  So, with an appointment in our future we couldn't stay out long.    Well, Christy has wanted to take me to this burger dive down the road from us called Red Robin.  Apparently it is a national chain, although I had never heard about Red Robin until we moved to Owings Mills.  We can see it from our Bedroom and Kitchen windows.  Though we are vegetarians, I do like a good sandwich and fries every now and again.  Toss in some fizz in a glass and I am quite happy.  As we are heading out we happen to see our next door neighbors coming out as well.  We had never really seen them before.  (Just an aside, we moved Christy into our apartment complex back in October or November.  The idea was that she would stay there until we got married and then I would move in.  This last bit has been happening since October or November and is still a work in progress.  It helps that my brother has now moved out of our old apartment.  At least now all of my stuff is filtering out somewhat and I can move it piecemeal into our new home or have a moment of silence as it sails toward the great trash heap in the sky. Anyhow, in that time we have seen very few people on our hall going in or out. So this was an odd experience already.)  It was a young couple, early 20’s, and when we acknowledged them they turned and seemed very into each other.  So, we went on our way and didn’t think too much about it.  The sky was darkening and wind began to whip.  It was clear that a storm was eminent.  We made our way to our truck.  Our neighbors had followed just after us and were driving out right behind.    We drove the short distance to the restaurant and parked.  Rain was falling when we got there and we made our way inside.  Soon after we were rejoined by our neighbors.  So, we did the awkward introductions and the hostess waited patiently.  When we finished the meet and greet she asked whether or not we would like to sit together.  It seemed unanimous that we would like to remain on our own thank you.  So, Christy and I went our way and they went theirs.  It wasn’t that we didn’t like them, we simply wanted to have an evening alone and they were thinking the same thing.  The meal was wonderful!  I had the mushroom burger with vege-meat which came with great thick fries, and I also had a Prickly Pear Soda.  Christy had the French Onion Soup and a Raspberry Soda.  Great service, great food, and great time together, who can ask for anything more?  I certainly can’t, and with that we left.  Jamie was waiting on our doorstep when we got home.  She was in her scrubs having just got off work.  It was 9 pm and we were all a tad tired, so the instructions were brief and the thanks were as plentiful as we could muster.  We could look forward to the trip now without reservation and get Stan and Gen hitched.  There is always something ahead, but we were well fed and packed and about to be well rested.  We hoped.

						   What little I know of where my life has been and where it will be going can be summed up in one small phrase,...  Well, it will come to me eventually.  In the mean time, I am going to try this mode of free expression to send my thoughts careening into the great beyond just for the ever loving fun of doing it.  File under; Everybody's doing it, so why can't I?  I don't suppose for a moment that this is a great idea, but it is a good enough idea for now and that is what really counts.  If I kept holding out for those great ideas I would never get anything done.  For example, right now I have half a dozen things that I could be doing.  I could list them out if I really wanted to, although what would the point of that be?  Except to say, there is a picnic that my department is planning and I am to facilitate the music for it.  This is usually not a big deal.  I am musical enough and can sling a banjo with the best of them (well if not the best, I can at least sling a banjo).  Although, they are wanting me to put together a country music show, and, though I am into banjo slinging, I am not really versed in secular country.  So, I am left with a bit of a quandary.  Nowthen, you might challenge my thinking and say that I got myself into this trouble by accepting the offer, and, though that is true, it doesn't help me much at this point.  I have contacted a few friends to help me, some of which have their own group and will be providing music on their own.  *Whew*.  BUT I still have to come up with a few standards on my own and I am shooting blanks at this point.  Not helpful.  So, the point of this is, (if there is going to be one), please post a comment if you are reading this and happen to know a tune or two that will go over well on the fly. From there, we'll see what happens.  Thank you in advance! :-)  I am continually getting myself in trouble like this, and if I keep this site up, and you return, you will read more about these sort of adventures that appear out of nowhere to bowl me over.  What a life!  Well, this is a start.  I am going to post this and see what happens now.

						   Before we were married I wrote my wife a poem called Looking Back for an anniversary gift. She shared it with her office and they were all aching for a copy to share with their husbands.  So, I rewrote it more generally and she passed it out to them and she encouraged me to get my writing out there. So, I started simply and registered the poem as follows with Poetry.com:  LOOKING BACK My way has not been easy; Simplicity was found in you. Everything I thought was true has been false; Truth was found in you. Days and weeks have passed quickly and painlessly; Time was found in you. Life has a natural newness that I have never known; Beauty was found in you. The future holds such great allure; Commitment was found in you. My heart is in your tender care; Love was found in you.  As it turned out the International Library of Poetry Editing Department who powers Poetry.com really liked the poem as well and asked to publish it in one of their many poetry collections.  So, I gave the go ahead and purchased a copy which I gave to my wife on our wedding night.  And she was as surprised and proud to discover that I was not only in the book but also the first entry.  Since then I have published several more poems with them and recently they honored me in a book called The Best Poets & Poems of 2003 or some such. And, again my poem is the first entry.  I am trying to keep perspective about this but it is difficult now that Stan's wedding has passed us by and I am left to my own thoughts.  So I am pretty proud and excited about it!    What I am bummed about is that there was a misprint in the text.  So, I have fixed it on their website, but it will be forever inaccurate on the page.  Bummer.  So here is the corrected version of that poem as well (the misprint was "attribute" where the word "tribute" is in the text).  THE BUR WITHIN What is this bur within my breast that maketh me ill content? To find this answer is the quest in which I'm most intent. Fortressed below my battered shell is a force that spurs me on, It provideth me no solace, pounding merciless and strong. I, therefore, shall my gauntlet throw before this mighty bur; And stalwart stand, with sword in hand, my vict'ry to insure! Oh thou vile bur, be you scared, yet quake in vain; My crusade's prize shall cherished be as freedom I attain. Time will be my friend before you cause me to retreat! I will live my life unhampered when thou fallest at my feet. And in that noble hour, mark thee well my words here said, I shall not blink, nor shed a tear, as thou liest before me dead. I shall, howe'er, thou breathless bur, rejoice in that great day, For, being gone, you shall prove I claim the final say. Thou shalt not be the guiding force within my life here laid. Instead thou shalt be buried deep within a forest glade. By this act I will tribute give for long with me you have been. I feel I owe that much to thee, whom I shall not see again. For, as much as I deny it, I know exactly who thou art; Thou art my ever throbbing, yearning, sighing, restless heart.  You can find both of these poems on the Poetry.com website along with many others under my name which just happens to be Corey Willett Cottrell. (Yea, I know.  The middle name came from my Grandfather.  When my Grandmother found out she nearly had my parents' heads.  She was not pleased with the choice.  So be it I say.)

						   . . . yesterday regarding my Tuba.  I contacted Vince Simonetti of the Tuba Exchange http://www.tubaexchange.com to find out about replacement parts and a little history for my Tuba.  As it turns out, my horn was made by F. E. Olds & Son circa 1966-1967.  (Vince was able to glean this from the serial number on the valve casing.) The Fullerton, CA plant where my horn was made has now been closed and the company still exists, but under new management.  Anyway, Simonetti said that he was very interested in my horn and would give me a half price trade in on this ¾ size tuba. http://www.tubaexchange.com/V&E%20TE-3812.htm   What Vince is most interested in is adding my horn to his collection at the Tuba Exchange because he says that they don’t have this particular horn. He also wants to front it to manufacturers in order to rally the development of new horns with the forward piston valve set up.  Apparently, companies just don’t make them anymore.    This is a bummer to me because I don’t care for the upright valve set ups on horns.  Personal preference sure, but I am entitled to my own opinion.  This is still a free country, right?  Nonetheless, I am still thinking on Vince’s proposal, but will still most likely send him a picture of my horn so that he can get a better idea what we are talking about.  When I figure out how to post pictures I will post one here too.

						   Here is a bit more in the continuing saga about my Tuba which I am now in the process of polishing.  See what happens when I have so much time to think about things? :-)  Shortly after I bought my Tuba, I get a call at work from Jim Tull, who originally sold it to me.  “Hey,” he said, “Do you still have that horn you bought from us a little while ago?”  “Sure do.”  I said.  “Are you using it this next weekend?”  He asked.  “Don’t think so,” I volleyed  “Well, I have a guy that needs a Tuba this weekend and I don’t know what to do about it,” Jim explained.  “He brought his Tuba in to be restored and it isn’t back from our Pennsylvania shop.  He needs it for a thing at Church and I wondered if you wouldn’t mind helping him out.”  “What church?” I asked, as I stalled to think about it a bit.  “Westminster,” Jim answered.  “He seems like a nice guy and has his own mouthpiece, so all we need is the horn.”  I began to grin as I knew exactly who it was.  The Tuba world is very small, and the Maryland Tuba world is even smaller.  The guy that Jim was talking about is a friend of mine.    Harold was given a gift of Tuba refurbishment for Christmas by his wife Christine.  She found out about it after I had told her about my Tuba and that Jim had suggested to me that if I ever wanted to get my horn refurbished to bring it back and they would send it away to be retooled.  Harold’s Tuba, when he sent it away, was held together by prayer and Chicken Wire.  He was hoping, and continuing to pray, that his horn would make it through the Makeover.  Harold is very particular about his Tuba.  He’ll tell you straight out that he went through a stack of Miraphones that didn’t produce the sound that this horn did.  Jim conferenced our call and we worked out the logistics.  When Harold was done with the Tuba I lent it to Daniel our Triadelphia Brass leader.  He was doing a few Tuba things and the horn made do for him.  Plus he was able to use it in our group.  At this point the Tuba was nestled in a nice gig bag that Harold had arranged with me to have.  (So nice of him!)  Although it was available, I didn’t really play it that much.  I didn’t like the way it looked or played.  Well, it was mostly the way it looked.  It bothered me that it was so tarnished and beat up.  As for playing, my lip was still fashioned to play Baritone horn so getting comfortable with a Tuba again was a BIG challenge.  So it didn’t get played.  Recently Daniel, in his wisdom, has been tossing me Tuba parts.  So, now I have had to mold my mind into acceptance of this horn for the good of our group.  Too be sure it is an uphill battle, but a worthwhile one.  Friday June 11, 2004 I got to the breaking point.  If I was going to have to play this Tuba, one, or both, of us was going to have to change for the better.  So, I went out and bought some Noxon brass polish and set to work.  (Side note: I don’t recommend this polish for lacquered instruments.  Only use Noxon brass polish on your instrument if you own an instrument like mine where anything is better than what it is now).    I didn’t get very far with the polishing before bed was calling to me, although I did work down the bell to discover a company inscription.  I had never been able to see it before.  Still, though it is nicely polished, I can’t make the inscription out really, but it is there; emblazoned on the bell.   Over the past few days I have been making a lot more head way.  So we’ll see how long this process takes.  Every day I rub a bit more shiny brass into view I get a bit more excited about what this Tuba could be.  We both have a lot of potential I think, and I am beginning to realize that if the horn looks good I had better start buckling down with my practicing.  We may both be diamonds in the rough.  Hmmm.  Extremely rough. ;-)

						   When I bought my Tuba, I simply needed something that would see me through the weekend.  There was a performance coming up and my friend Paul was on his way down from Chicago to help our brass group out.  At the time our Triadelphia Brass group was sorely lacking in Bass Brass. (Truly ironic now, because all we have currently is low brass.)  I was the only real Bass in the group and I was hashing out 4th Trombone parts on my Baritone.  So, anything would be better I thought.  I called around for rentals and had been searching E-BAY, but nothing was looking good enough to shell out money for, or even in my price range, (which was a pretty meager spread and particularly ridiculous for Tuba range).  As a last resort, I called some acquaintances of mine up at TULL MUSIC in Laurel, MD.  I told them what I wanted and they asked me if I was particular about what the horn looked like and I said, “At this point, as long as it plays, I don’t care.”  So, Jackie said, “Come on by.  We’ll find you something.”  Paul had arrived by this point, so he and I headed up there.  Jackie had hauled out this big silver Sousaphone, but it was in miserable shape and hardly played.  I was feeling a might queasy.  Jackie said, “That doesn’t sound too good.  Let me see if I can find you something else.”  With that she headed upstairs into the attic of the shop and pretty soon she was hollering down, “I think I found something!”  I was beginning to feel a twinge of relief.  She brought down a big hunk of Concert BBb brass tubing.  It was heavily dented and gold with tarnish, but, when Paul played it, the horn sang pretty well.    “I forgot we had this thing,” said Jackie.  “It was given to us from Spencerville Academy as a payment for work that they had us do here.”  “Do you think you want it?” asked Jim, Jackie’s husband who is a miracle worker in the shop as we would soon see.  “Well, how much are you asking?” I winced.   With that we negotiated a price and Jim said, “Let me get out some of these major dents for you.”  He then proceeded to disassemble the horn piece by piece and heat the metal, all the time working out the dents.  Paul and I stood slack jawed and with great interest.  While Jim worked he talked to us about bluegrass, his passion, and told stories of the old days.  We watched and listened.  Paul did much better than me in carrying on his part of the conversation.  Paul has been known to talk with authority or confidence (which are not necessarily the same thing), on many subjects that will keep himself and/or others entertained.  As long as I have known Paul, (which is quite a long time now), I have both envied and been annoyed by this gift of his.  (Just get him talking about Chicago pizza and pizzerias and you’ll understand what I mean. :-)  When Jim finished we settled the bill.  I wrapped the Tuba in a blanket and we took it home.  That night we rehearsed and Paul pedaled on that horn like nobody’s business.  Our group was blown away.  We wanted to have Paul and the Tuba on a permanent contract.  Unfortunately, Paul is unavoidably busy in Chicago, and yet the Tuba remains.

						   There seems to be this strange and unmistakable uneasiness that has come over me of late.  It is a sort of yearning for something better in facets of my life.  I am not sure what to equate it to.  Nor am I certain that there is anything that I feel drawn to particularly.  Although, come to think on it, I have been, most recently, working fairly feverishly on a Tuba that I bought a year or so ago.  It is a Tuba that has had quite a history.  The only reason I know this is because over the last few days I have been polishing this horn and, although I was told a little of the story about it when I purchased it, I have been able to find markings on the bell which indicate that this Tuba has made a little circuit of it's own through it's life.  Mostly, this Tuba had found its way through school systems.  By the time I bought it, the Tuba looked like it had gone to the school of hard knocks.  I am working on making the Tuba’s general appearance better, but we’ll see how that goes over the long haul.    What I can tell you already is Brasso is nasty to work with and doesn’t polish instruments worth a ding-dong.

						   Mmmmm, polish.  Yes, I am polishing away again.  I stopped by Super Fresh and picked up my Noxon Brass cleaner and have continued to polish the bell on my Tuba. It is almost done now, although there are some rough bits ahead.  Somehow just looking at a Tuba it is easy to overlook all of the small nooks and crannies that there are.  When polishing a Tuba, all of a sudden there are pinchy places everywhere.     For now it is a lot of rubbing and hoping that I get some of the crud off anyway.  We'll see.  Determination is the key to this job.  Not letting the tarnish win.  Taking everything bit by little bit.  It is paying off though.  There is a marked difference in the horn and to a lesser extent the player.  I am not sure if these issues are related, but I'll take any help I can get.

						   I tell you, I am going through withdrawals.  I was mentioning this to the guys at brass rehearsal last night and they wondered if I wasn't missing the fragrant fumes a bit too much. No, really, I haven’t been able to polish my horn for several days now, and it is beginning to wear on me.  Some of this hault in activity is due to time constraints and some of it is due to the fact that I have run out of my Noxon Brass polish and haven’t taken the time to pick up any more.  So, for now, that frame of reference is dead for thumb tacking my life.  There is other news, however.  As you may, or may not, recall, when I started this Blog I was actively avoiding work on a Country Courtyard Celebration that our department was putting on.  Well, as with most things, it couldn’t be put off forever and I had to do some minor scrambling at the end and get it sorted out.  It turns out that there wasn’t really much to sort out before the actual event.  Well, that isn’t quite true.  I did have to adjust my thinking a little bit with regard to how much I was going to actually invest in the program, but that is pretty much all.  What I needed to fill was one and a half hours worth of country music.  I’m not much of a country music listener myself, but I do enjoy Bluegrass (which is not the same thing, thank you) and Folk.  So, I constructed a basic list of tunes from those catalogs and consulted with the right people who made it work.  I also burned a CD to run after we had exhausted our list, so that there would be music going while we ate at the picnic.    So often musicians give all they have in a performance for a dinner, or picnic in this case, and wind up without anything to eat. Usually, by the time musicians end their set and are ready to eat everybody is cleaning up and putting everything away.  Very few people think about the musicians actually eating.  So, I made a safeguard CD to ensure that we could grab some grub.  The CD had all the sort of stuff that we couldn’t handle, played by some of the best in Bluegrass; Allison Krause & Union Station, John Hartford, Bella Fleck, Ricky Skaggs with the Chieftains, and on and on.  Good to cover the bases.  The whole thing went off like . . . well, once we got started everything went OK, let’s put it that way.  I left work to get down there in plenty of time, but halfway down I realized that I had forgotten the music.  So, I headed back, picking up steam.  Then back down the Interstate.  It is normally a 20 min drive and it was now approaching 11:15 am and I had planned to be there at 11:00 am.  Oi!  Now the clock and miles were ticking swiftly by, well the miles were after I passed all of the idiots on the road.  I have found that, in general, the more stressed the time, the more plentiful the idiots.  Yesterday was no exception.  Then just as I was approaching a mile to my exit the whole Interstate shuts down around me.  I found out later a tractor trailer had turned over on the I-495 Beltway.  Meanwhile I can’t go anywhere.  Crumb! That was an agonizing mile.  Fortunately, God saw me safely there.  Once there we had to verify Microphone set up and do a sound check.  I had sent a diagram with the Mics that we would need, and soon that was out the window because I had counted on more guitars with ¼” jacks and, sadly, that was not to be the case.  So, the AV guys scrambled a little.  I felt really bad, particularly because I have been in their shoes.  All I could do was stand there in dismay and empathy.  They were polite and professional and extremely efficient.  I was so pleased.  After a quick run through of our last number, Home on the Range, we played our opener; Life is Like a Mountain Railroad.  It went really well.  What really made the gig better was having the Johnson-Greene Quartet with me.  They are friends of mine from Church and have sung together for a while.  They provided great harmonies and music on their own. All I needed to do was keep up on the banjo and guitar.  We had another Guitarist, Rick, who added a lot to the sound and covered up some minor artistic infractions.   Thank you, Rick.  And, my friend, Frank played such sweet Violin for the first two numbers.  All in all it was a great time with great people.  How can you ask more than that?  I’m just glad it is over so that I can start getting serious about my horn project again. ;-)

						   Until I get to a few of the things that have kept me occupied of late, my brother, Nick, graciously gave me permission to place here this post of events from my family's recent trip to northern Michigan to retrieve my Grandma's remaining items at the old house in the woods.  Thanks again Nick! _____________________________________________________  Okay everyone, here's a log of our activities last week in Onaway to clear out the garage at grandma & grandpa's place, (for those of you who care):  We headed up first thing Tuesday morning.  It takes about 6 hours to get there.  Glad I didn't have to drive!  Carl had brought up his 17-foot canoe for some fun on Black Lake.  On our way up, dad found out the truck he would be picking up in Cheboygan wouldn't be ready until after 4 p.m.  Seeing as we had some time, we stopped off at Camp Au Sable.  I hadn't been there in about 20 years.  It was interesting to see that despite some significant changes to the grounds, the main camp had not changed much at all.  We stopped by the office & dad chatted with the camp director, Jim something or other.  (When you start getting older there are two things that go first – your short-term memory and I can't remember the other thing.)  Anyway, we went through the dining area, which was pretty much the same and then on to the newly attached meeting room.  Quite the large room that they claimed would hold over 250 people.  They had attached the extension for the meeting room on the dining area into where the staff cabins used to be.  Now the staff lodgings are underneath the meeting room.  They looked pretty nice.  We were able to drive the camper out to the fort.  They had torn down the old fort and erected a new one.  The new fort looks pretty much like the old fort with the exception of the corner "turrets" which were now larger.  The sleeping quarters were nicer also.  The gates were locked, so we could just peek in.  With much persuading, we managed to eat lunch while we were still stationary there and were on the road again.  We headed out to Black Lake first to drop off Carl and Evonne to claim a spot and set up their tent.  Ah tent camping, how I don't miss it.  Mom, dad & I headed up to Cheboygan to pick up the moving truck.  My dad had reserved a 24-foot truck.  We wondered if we really needed one that big.  Turns out, we did.  We got there just before 4 p.m. and the truck hadn't arrived yet.  Dad had to call in to a Adventist Heritage conference call to determine some big changes that would affect the village.  There was barely a signal up there, so after being dropped more that a few times, dad had to wander around until he found the best spot was in the waiting room of the rental office.  How fortunate, because it had started to rain outside.  The truck showed up just as dad was finishing his call and mom & I got the rental thing all settled.  We headed back to Onaway and dropped the truck off at the new church and headed to Black Lake.  When we got back to the campsite, Carl had their tent set up, a fire going and a tarp rigged up over top of the camp chairs to keep the rain off us.  What a handy guy.  We roasted vege-links and had a good supper.  And thanks to Carl's camping expertise, kept dry for the most part.  The camper has a canopy, which we extended over the picnic table, and that worked out well.  No canoeing that night.  Wednesday morning we headed off to grandma's house with the moving truck.  I think when you get older, things get smaller.  The house was much smaller than I remember it being.  But then again, I was much smaller back then too.  We surveyed Ellen & Roscoe's handiwork of packing up the house about 5 or 6 years ago and stuffing all the furniture, books, clothing and everything into the "garage" in "sealed barrels""  HA!  Sealed barrels my sweet patootie.  The garage, (for those folks who have not been there), is a glorified wooden structure my grandpa put up.  It has cedar logs, (with the bark still on), for the supporting posts and attic beams.  The sides and roof are shingled, but the doors are just big wooden things with huge gaps between them.  I was amazed that everything was pretty dry in there.  Everything had a wonderful musty aroma.  We spent most of the day Wed. sorting things and packing the truck. Fortunately, it didn't rain that day or it would have been a mess.  We could only fit the moving truck in the driveway, so the camper was parked along side the gravel road.  Evonne was getting out of the camper and turned to help mom out.  Evonne slipped on a wet log hidden in the grass and sprained her ankle.  So we sat her down in a chair and she went through boxes and bags.  By the time we were done, the truck was full.  After we were done, we headed back to the campsite. The wind had really picked up, so we rigged up another tarp between two trees for a windbreak.  That worked quite well. We roasted vege-links again and my mom had picked up some eggs at the store to make scrambled eggs for breakfast.  Well, they kind of fell out of the fridge when she opened it, so we ended up having our scrambled eggs for supper.  By the time we were done eating and putting everything away, the rain had started up again, so no canoeing.  I think everyone was too sore anyway.  Thursday we got up and the rain was still drizzling.  We gave up on the canoeing and packed everything up and headed out.  We got back to Battle Creek about 5 p.m. and unloaded all the stuff into Smith Hall, (one of the vacant Village houses next to my parent's place).  They have their work cut out for them this summer going through all that stuff.  My grandmother was a pack rat of sorts and kept all kinds of magazines, mail, files, etc.  (I know now that I get it honestly from both sides of the family!)  We just brought it all back for mom & dad to go through at their "leisure".  Corey called Sunday morning before I left, so I even got to talk with him while he was out vacationing in Washington state.  That worked out well.   Later,  Nick

       Quick report,   the kids are doing what I would term a very good (bordering on great) job with this musical. I was a bit skeptical, in light of past reports from Daniel, and the two rehearsals..., but everything has seemed to fall into place nicely.  Tonight and tomorrow for performances, as far as I know. Too bad I will miss the senior recital, it sounds like it would be good.  got the warm-ups and will print and try to use them.  I got about 15 min with the mouth piece on the way to work, and last night I got about 10 with the mouthpiece and receptacle (horn). Did this with the practice mute in defference to the neighbors, and this seems to cause me to play harder, probably due to a slight restriction in air flow, but not problematic.  I also get about 15 to 20 min with the set, mouthpiece and horn, during a performance, so 20 Thursday, and 20 more tonight, and twice that tomorrow.  Regarding music of any type, string, brass, recorder, I am willing to join. It is always more fun to play with others. (…plays well with others…)  Jamey

       Another good question:    How often would Der Chor perform per month?   The more churches we represent (i.e. we have core members from those churches) the more places we'll have an obvious reason to sing.  Bluntly: I don't know.  It depends on what the core members are willing and eager to do.  I'd like to see the program grow large enough to handle two or more churches on the same Sabbath.  As a place to start, I feel like we should aim to have 16 singers at each gig, and hope to have 32 on the roster, so not everyone is required at every opportunity.

       Reminder: Jan Wall from Spencerville Academy has asked us to play with her band for church at Triadelphia on May 15.  As I understand it, all of us are interested, but Corey anticipates dental agony over that weekend.

       Here's what I'm aware of, at the moment, in case anyone wants to co-ordinate with us this weekend.  Sabbath morning, Washington Community Brass are at Spencerville  Sabbath afternoon (tentative), bicycling with Sharon, possibly at Rock Creek Park  Sunday afternoon (tentative), 4:00 PM Sligo Atrium, Senior Recital of Dan Hall, euphonium and trombone player, musician extraordinaire, a.k.a. The Black Mozart  As I'm posting this info I'm hoping that it increases the odds of being at the same place at the same time as any of you.  Jamey, what's left for King-n-I performances?

       Hey Daniel, thank you so much for including the warms ups.  I am bursting with emotions, like excitement, intrigue, disbelief, and terror, but it’s all good. :-)  Thank you also for the responses about Der Chor.  I did need another question answered though, because I was way too slick about asking it before.  (So slick it passed right on by us all.  Hate it when that happens. ;-)    How often would Der Chor perform per month?  It does sound like fun.  I am sad to hear about the “R” word.  Not all my cup-o-tea, but I can down a pot or two for a while simply to sing again.  Been missing that a bit lately.  Sorry to hear about Vicki’s laptop troubles.  Hope alls well that ends, well…

       Corey, your pledge has been heard (received? read?) and witnessed.  More power to you!  Male Chorus: I'm not averse to the idea, although I'm cautious, given who's choosing the repertoire.  (There's that R word again.)  If it's all as good as Tschesnokoff, I'm with you all the way.  Brass: One thing that would make me happier is a better fit between our players and our parts.  Guys, please take some time to search for music sources and find out what we can buy that fits our five players.  I'll give you two stores to start with:  urlLink Robert King Music  and  urlLink Hickey's Music Online .  If we had one more trumpet player we could get into some standard brass quintet music.

       David  urlLink asked earlier  about people's summer plans, musically.  Don't overlook  urlLink Chamber Music Weekend , July 14-18.  Brass break? There are times when it seems difficult to face another rehearsal.  But I'm feeling (like Corey) encouraged with where we see ourselves going.  I'm not sure we're organized, yet, or that we have the right repertoire.  But my feeling is that we're just getting rolling, so a break now would be detrimental.  Recorders? Given De De and Jamey's recent acquisitions, we need to pursue some basic recorder ensemble opportunities; perhaps something like the afternoon of Corey and Christy's wedding.  Just get together and play and play . . . Repertoire is the tricky bit, and I'm hoping Geri proves to have a large supply.  Strings?  Same thing, basically.  We're short staffed, somewhat: we need another violin or viola who can manage to read music as well as Jamey can.  (Kudos, Jamey: your cello playing is showing excellent progress.  It's obvious that you're not having to learn music as you learn technique.  Very impressive!)  Repertoire is, again, a potential roadblock.  I have some Haydn quartets, but not much else.  Personally, I'm not crazy about music with fewer than four parts.  Five is better, etc.  But it's better to play a duet than to miss a chance to play chamber music!  We need more music that calls for strings and  urlLink chic   urlLink flutes .  (Hi Jamie!)  Impromptu chamber music?  Call me!  My number is . . .

       David, it sounds like a good beginning.  Be encouraged.  Wednesday night was, for me, a wash for practicing: we sat at the local CompUSA for about 2 hours waiting to get Vicki's Mac laptop swapped out.  Tonight I had a 90-minute (about) rehearsal with WCB, playing mostly tuba.  I did get to play trombone on one Gabrielli:  Canzon Primi Toni , or something like, I think.  It was high: it started on high F and stayed there much more than I liked.  I got little reaction from the guys, so I'm not sure how well I did.

       In  urlLink this post   Corey asked some fundamental questions.  (Great questions, Corey.  Thanks for the springboard!) Here are the answers I've been contemplating, as a place to begin discussion:   What sort of music would Der Chor sing? Would it be standard fair or high church?   You can get a feel for the kind of repertoire I like by looking at what I selected for the church service last October 25.  Those pages are still online  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .    What sort of denominations of churches, if any, are in mind?   Well, it's not the denomination that's as interesting as the motivated singers.  Given the people involved in this discussion today, we'd be focused on Sabbath morning SDA services.  As our core choir began to have members from other denominations, if their home churches wanted the music we offered, we should be willing to sing for them.    What would the frequency of guest spots be for Der Chor?   I'm picturing a core Chor of perhaps 32 people, with hopes that about half of those people would be able to show up for any given gig.  Suppose we had a chance to sing at Triadelphia.  We would arrange to rehearse with interested singers at their church once or twice before that Sabbath.  Because we would already know our music cold, those rehearsals would be very beneficial as we could interleave the local "guests" into our own ranks.  The purpose of this choir is not to build a reputation as a solo ensemble, (oxymoron?) but to provide the foundation, the core, so that every constituent church could feel as if it had its own church choir.    What would a typical service look like that included Der Chor?   A typical service would look like any other service with a standard, in-house choir.  I'd expect us to sing an introit, prayer responses, anthem and benediction, or something like that.    Would there be a collection of appropriate responses?   The SDA hymnal has a surprisingly useful collection of responses.  However, additonal response collections are available on the market.    Would this be purely vocal or a musical combo?   I'm picturing this as a vocal core ensemble, actually incomplete (too small) without local singers.  It might help to have a couple of organists on staff, for rehearsals and in case the local church organist was not available.

       Progress on practice is slow but steady: two 5-minute sessions Wednesday evening and a 10-minute session Thursday morning.  A significant portion of that time was spent trying the warmup exercise Daniel encouraged.  Result so far: EXCELLENT pedal tones, with reduced higher range.  We'll see what more practice provides.

       Der Chor is a choir concept.  Within one congregation (especially Triadelphia) we don't have enough experienced, talented, dedicated singers to maintain a church choir.  This may be true in other churches as well.  The idea is to pull together singers from all the local congregations, potentially even from other denominations.  Der Chor would run one or two rehearsals at each church during the week or two previous to singing there, giving the local church members a chance to join up and sing with a "big choir" in their own church.  Der Chor would provide the core people, skills and knowledge of the repertoire.  I like the name because it's a play on the homonyms  core  and  Chor  (German for Choir).

       I concur with David’s kudos to Danny for setting up this forum.  This will be great for spewing out thoughts and helping with concepts or ideas as we are rediscovering and reforming our ministry in music.    Last night’s Brass rehearsal got my heart racing as I felt that finally we were being honest with each other about where we were individually with the Triadelphia Brass and where we would like to go collectively.  As I processed this with Christy, she responded to my fits of gleeful expounding with the question, “Isn’t this the same place you were with Brass when I met you?”  And I have to say truthfully and surprisingly, no!  Yes, I was adjusting and feeling uneasy about where we were and where we were going / if we were going, but the feeling that I got last night was much different.  There was a lot of determination and dedication emanating from all of us.  I admit to being the weaker spirit in the group, and last night I have determined, and now pledge, that after I return from 3ABN I will take 30 minutes every day and hash out parts.  I have tried apathy and that is pathetic.  I have tried constancy and that goes no where.  So, now I am going to try brute determination and resolve.  We will all see how that goes.  I am looking forward to whatever happens with Brass, and though I admit that I am not having too much fun right now I pledge to do my part to make a difference on my own for the good of the group.  As for this summer David, this week Jim has coordinated having people meet who are interested in singing in a Male Chorus.  I have been helping him a bit with this and am looking forward to singing in a men’s group again.  I hope you guys consider coming.  Thanks again for the great talk last night.  Corey

       I enjoy Daniel's philosophy of getting things done.  Kudos to him for setting this up!  Since rehearsal was last night I'm as yet unable to brag about practice time, but I do have a question.  What's happening musically this summer in our community?  The Baroque Consort will of course be taking a break, as it is tied to the school schedule and Geri is most likely going on furlough.  How about the brass?  My hope is that we don't break.  Does anyone in the Baroque Consort want to get something together during the summer months?  Do we need a goal for the choir this quarter?  Is there a time we just want to invite our out-of-town friends and have a musical jam session?

       Yesterday i missed practice, but i worked for about 20 min on wed. Did some playing of the transposed music and worked on the warm-up exercise. Amazingly, i was able to hit a high Bb before and after the 20 min... almost squeaked a B. also playing with a practice mute... hinders a bit of air flow and i can feel it in my sinuses. better than annoyed neighbors!  Also, i have been using the finale notepad for notation entry, very easy and quick. I did three yesterday while waiting for De De to pick me up. It does have some limitations, but since it is free, i cannot complain too much.  Jamey

       May 29 I'm scheduled to play the organ for Triadelphia.  By the way, June 26 is the day that my brass-playing family (x6) is coming from out of town and playing at Triadelphia  (perhaps, in part, the very lack of brass helpers that is being referenced).  We've been hoping to combine with the Triadelphia brass for a couple of numbers, and my uncle should be sending some music along in a few days for that purpose.

       First, i must admit, I was a bit reluctant to "give up" the 'cello, as i was enjoying doing what i could, but i could see that Daniel was not really itching to go back to the audience... and i did have another instrument... Ultimately, it was a great experience, and it sounded much better with more parts. I really enjoyed it, perhaps as much as he did!!!  Second, and a complete change of subject, how about a chamber music weekend up here? at CUC or somewhere close? we are not without contacts there and certainly not without some talent in the area. Could even consist of some string and or brass clinics, perhaps some wind (recorder)???  just a thought.  Jamey

       Jamey gave me one of the best gifts I've received from anyone, ever, this weekend, quite by accident.  Vicki and I decided to attend the Sunday afternoon performance of  The King & I  at Spencerville Adventist Academy.  Although we both have reservations about encouraging academy and elementary kids to focus so much time and energy on Broadway musicals, we decided to see one show in support of Jamey and De De, who were both in the "pit" orchestra.  When I'm playing, it means a lot to me to see friends in the audience, and that's why we wanted to be there for the Maydens.  But that's not how things worked out.  Before the show we chatted with the orchestra players and with pianist/conductor Jan Wall.  Jan pointed out that she had several empty chairs and said she could use my help.  The only spare instrument to be found was the string bass, so I jumped in to cover that part.  After a number or two (as my right-hand fingertips were beginning to blister from pizz'ing) Lester Roach, the bassist, arrived and took over.  I slid into the empty chair next to Jamey, waiting for a good break in the play so I could rejoin my family.  Well, I quickly found myself watching Jamey's music, and soon I was counting along and turning pages for him.  After a few numbers it was time for him to switch from 'cello (which he was covering in the (complete) absence of the hired 'cellist) to horn, and he handed the 'cello  and music  to me.  Um, what's a guy to do?  Jamey let me continue playing his 'cello through the remainder of the play, and again during the second show.  It's very hard to describe the experience: I'm getting an adrenaline rush just trying.  As far as I can remember, I'd previously performed only one number as a 'cellist: some number by Pachelbel.  But I was able to figure out roughly where my fingers should go, and my violin/viola/bass experience helped me get the bow pressure about right, at least when I remembered to keep the bow off the bridge.  For me that afternoon and evening provided several hours of "rush," equal to anything I've heard about skiing or surfing.  That was, to me, perfect entertainment.  Jamey, I know that you were relishing your own opportunity to garner experience with your new instrument.  You unselfishly gave that up, and it meant the world to me.  My left-hand fingertips are sore today, from pressing 'cello strings, and it's the best feeling.  Thank you!  A big thank you also to Vicki, William and Beth who put up with the drastically altered schedule and delayed supper so I could be at the second show.  I love you!

       In the absence of David Greene I do not expect to be meeting with Geri this Tuesday.  Ergo, let's revert to having brass practice at Triadelphia for this week.  Yes?  No?    6:45 call time,  7:00 rehearsal.  To clarify: both David and Corey are missing tonight.  However, we have May 15 band music to review, Wes and Jamey, so let's get together anyway.

       If you're out of town, take your mouthpiece.  Get it to your lips for 30 seconds or 10 minutes a day.  Believe it or not, when you get back you'll feel less lost than if you do nothing for three days.  Find and buy a  urlLink BERP  to help you out.

       5-10 minutes per day, every day.  The treat on Sabbath was having my wife accompany me.  I might become convinced there is, in some small way, improvement.  Alas, I will be out of town Tuesday through Thursday evenings, and am choosing not to pack the trombone on the plane.

       The king and I is finished, I had an enjoyable time yesterday. Daniel and Family came to the performance, and in true musician fashion, he joined right in! Sounded much better on cello than I did (I am both impressed and a bit jealous ) In light of this additional time with the instrument, I got much more “practice” in than I had first thought I would. See you all on Tuesday.  Jamey

       I guess it depends upon how the individual that used the word defines/views it, I am guessing that based upon your post that the implication was that this is a bad habit.  I would say a habit is bad if it turns into an addiction, i.e., devoting or surrendering oneself to something habitually or obsessively to the exclusion of others or all else (this is the way I would view it).  I will say creating a "good habit" can be very helpful -- in my case, it was starting an exercise program (running) that I started 6 years ago and subsequently lost 20 pounds and got in shape (decreased my cholesterol level, blood pressure, heart rate, etc.).  Getting up the fortitude to go out and run at least three times a week was very difficult at first, however, after forcing myself to do this for several months, I suddenly realized that it had become a "habit" and now I don't feel right if I go two or more days without running.  Is this a "bad habit” or addiction?  I think not, since this benefits me in a good way and I would not do this to the exclusion or detriment of others.  The question I ask myself "is what I do a detriment to God, others, or myself"?  If the answer were yes to any one of these, I would need to seriously consider what I am doing.

       In recent conversation someone (not one of our team) referred to my musical interests as a  habit  to be supported, i.e. an addiction as to drugs.  The point being made was that Vicki deserves applause, kudos, mad props, etc. for putting up with all that I'm involved in.  And that point was spot-on.  But I've been trying to shake the analogy, and it hasn't been easy.  Is music an addiction for me?  Do I selfishly pursue it?  If so, should I go into rehab?  Quit cold turkey?  These are certainly different terms than I normally use to describe the activities that keep me busy and happy.  I write in the first person, but I suppose these questions could be asked by any of us.  Are we developing and using God's gifts according to His will?  Can we exploit this gift of music more effectively?  When does it become selfish? or a habit? or an addiction?

       Sounds like it's coming together.  I'd like to hear from the Greenes, esp. re: Mrs. Greene's friends.  But I think we'll have the parts covered even without the extra cello and bass, as long as oboe-stephanie is on hand.  Recorders would be a lot of fun, but we'll need to be sure that Geri is present and brings a wad of music with her.  Anyone with a telephone want to work on this?   CMWs:  I'm not ready to make these happen yet.  These events take a  huge  effort, and with my networking track record, I'm in doubt about getting enough good players together here to make it work.  And I'm not crazy about the facilities at CUC.  I need to hear more from this community: more ideas, more people, etc.   Soldering:  I think it should be do-able.  The trick would be to fill the lead pipe with something to keep the solder from collecting inside: perhaps cork, or tape, or something else.  It might be valuable to visit a repair shop and ask how they do it.  Be sure to ask about the solder/lacquer interaction.  I'm wondering how a hole like that is formed anyway.   Networking:  Keep your heart open to opportunities to recruit players into our ensembles.  We don't need to drag in unwilling parties, or coerce anyone, but when you find someone like Wes (kudos, Wes) who will show up on a regular basis and put some effort and outside practice into it, listen for the Spirit's guidance.

       Hey, if it floats your boat, go for it!  As far as getting your hands on one,  urlLink Zephyr Brass  in Atlanta has/had a used one they may be/have been willing to sell for around $2K, and when I was in Atlanta it was in good condition.  Recommended.  The new model I had my heart set on is the  urlLink Miraphone 181 Series F Tuba 1816VGB - 6 Valves, Gold Brass .

       for some strange reason, i am feeling the need to play a small Tuba!?????  :o)  BTW planning to bring my bass to church for dulcimer play..., as well as the horn and cello (celli) for afternoon play. How about recorders?   De De is calling oboe-stephanie to invite her.  Jamey

       Jamey, I really appreciate the offer to fix my pipe.  That is so kind!  I can't do it tonight because Christy and I have a few errands to run.  I do wonder about what the solder is going to do when affixing to the lacquer and whether or not it will drip inside the hole or widen the hole.  This is not to call into question your soldering abilities, I am simply raising possible difficulties that we should think about before attempting surgery on this horn.  Tape may be unsightly, but it doesn't have permanent effects on the horn's performance.  Just thinking out loud.  Does anybody else have any thoughts on this before we put the Tuba under the iron?  On other fronts, I second Jamey's cheers regarding the calendar!

       :o)  Great to hear that Corey had a mini practice with a visitor! how cool!  If you want, i can try to help you solder up any holes and try to make the scrap metal less scrappy  I have a small solder iron here and a large solder machine in Hagerstown. I am free tonight!   Daniel, keep us posted in and CMW weekends that would be here locally. I am really excited about that prospect.  RE music this Sabbath, i will let De De know to invite Steph with the oboe.

       Hey Daniel, thank you for the response to my musing epistle.  •	...it sounds like your trip was a success. Congrats!   Thank you.  Mark and I had a good time and from what we saw after the shoot in the director’s booth it looked good.  We had certain creative differences with the producers, but the Lord has a wonderful way of taking the best from everything and working for the greater good.   I have great faith that He will take our small offerings and reap great things.  •	Be sure to let us know when you get air-dates for your work.   I will keep everyone posted.  Just don’t expect to hear anything until the fall (August or September).  •	Do you anticipate more work like this in the future?  Funny you should ask.  Someone was just here who wanted me to do some of these stories for the Beltsville SDA Church Destination Sabbath School (Specifically the feeding of the 5K, which I didn’t even tell him I had just written for this shoot).  It is amazing how God works!  •	How has it been practicing at the warehouse?  It is working out very well.  In fact, last night the South-Eastern CA Conference driver Eric Reid was here and he happened to see my cases in the Locker Room.  So, he comes into my office and asks who the owner of the Baritone case was.  I told him it was mine and that I also owned the piece of scrap metal disguised in the very attractive gig bag.  He was so excited to find another low brass player.  “I majored in Euphonium Performance in College!” he exclaimed.  So, of course, we spent the next hour and a half playing various Tuba Christmas tunes together.  He tried out the scrap metal and I blew Baritone.  It was wild.  Eric was also able to locate a leak in the lead pipe on my tuba that we “fixed” with some electrical tape, and it made a world of difference.  All of a sudden the horn was getting solid pedals and the intonation was much more pure.  Amazing.  I was so glad for committing to practice time.  It was truly a miracle in music.  •	We'll need to choose dates to offer to the Spanish church. Suggestions, anyone?  Any time after July is good for me.  •	July 17 is in the middle of CMW in Collegedale, but we may be willing to try Linthicum on a different weekend.  I am sort of tied into this date.  This date was set a few months back and to now say, “Can we move it so that it is more accommodating” might seem strange.  But, the Church is always looking for music so I can mention to their music coordinator, Mary Brown, that we are interested in scheduling a weekend with them and she would be delighted.  •	I've sent an invitation to both of Paul's addresses.  Thank you!

        urlLink Here  are the parts to cover.  Can we all get together this Sabbath afternoon?  Yes, D2, please call Stephane.  Jamie, can your friends join us then?  (How was your final exam?)  What time?  Where?  I'm thinking two o'clock-ish in the sanctuary at Triadelphia SDA.  What do you think?

       Jamey suggested in  urlLink this post  that we should have another CMW here in the Maryland area, and it's not the first time I've heard the suggestion.  I've also heard suggestions for brass weekends, woodwind weekends, and voice weekends.  How can we gauge the level of enthusiasm for these ideas?  When will we know it's reached critical mass?  I think there's a lot of merit to each idea.  Jeremy is aware of the concept, and supportive.

We have opportunity to play 2 - 5 numbers on May 22 at Triadelphia, so we need to figure out what we're doing.  We can also run through the SAA band music for May 15.

With two more players we could even take a whack at the Hummel Septet.  We need the Greenes, the Maydens, the Ashtons and Jamie's friends.  And anyone else who's interested.

       Remarkably, I am back from my eventful and otherwise LONG trip.  When I got back Friday we figured up that I had been on the road from TUE – FRI between 6.5 & 7 hours each day.  (*Big Sigh*).  I am so glad that everything with that trip is finally done.  Mark Feldbush and I had a great time and were able to shoot 9 Bible stories for 3ABN’s show Kid’s Time.  They should be airing sometime around August.  They said that they will send us the dates for sure when the shows are in the can.  I didn’t take either of my mouthpieces along, but I am keeping my commitment and have brought my Tuba to work in order to practice for a half hour tonight before I head home.  (I too am thinking of my neighbors.  Less concerned about my coworkers.  We make enough noise during the course of our normal day, so what's a bit of brass noise at the end of the day?)    In other news, I was approached today by Xavier Covarrubias of the Washington Spanish SDA Church (off of New Hampshire Ave. just north of 29) who would like us to come sometime and do music for SS & Church.  The date he gave me was May 29, but I checked the blog and told him that Spencerville had already asked us for that day.  (Should be fine for me BTW.) So, he will wait for us to give him other possible dates.  Another date for consideration is July 17.  I have been asked to provide music at the Linthicum SDA Church (just off of W. Nursery Road on Andover Rd.) and it would be great if we could do the SS & Church thing there.  They also have a Family Praise Song Service which is basically a regular Song Service but geared to include both kids and parents.  So, I usually bring my guitar and banjo and pick good old hymns and tunes.  It would be great to have some other help on that Sabbath too.  Please….  One more thing, could we send an invitation to Paul Schilling for this Blog?  I think he might enjoy it, and he might try to come down more often if he started feeling like an extension of our Triadelphia Brass.  Wouldn’t he be such a great asset to have now and again?  Looking forward to seeing you guys again tomorrow.  BTW where will rehearsal be this week?

       Hello, just a quick practice report.  Monday, had about 3 minutes before i had to quit... tuesday, had a Dr's appt, ( missed brass practice) but got some mouthpiece time in. Wed, did about 20 min in one of the Canadian Brass books. Thursday, did about an hour with several different pieces and from a Canadian Brass book  Each day i try to get about 5 - 10 min with the mouthpiece on the way to work.  The warmups seem to really be extending my range very quickly, i had no idea it would work so quickly!!!  Keep practicing, Jamey

       Great plan, it reminds me of a house that was being built next to a house i was helping to build... there was a dance floor being installed in the basement, now home theaters are the norm, but this idea is quite akin to that idea. Even a large room without special audience seating could accommodate this concept.   Jamey

       This is an idea I've been mulling over for some time, and it came back to me this morning.  It seems appropriate to discuss it in this time when people are talking about buying or building houses.  The idea is incomplete, as if I'm seeing only some pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.  Perhaps you can see other pieces.  What I see is this: Prepare a small auditorium that comfortably stages about eight string players and a concert grand, a stage smaller than Ackerman.  Prepare very informal seating arrangements, perhaps in a steep amphitheatre style.  Offer weekly (or nightly?) non-concerts, events to which the public is invited, (advertisements?) but it's understood that the musicians are not strictly performing.  They may stop and restart a movement, for example.  The audience should be comfortable bringing books or laptops or other quiet occupations, and are free to enter and exit as needed, i.e. concert protocol need not apply.  In some cases the players might start with a more difficult work, and finish with something more approachable, for which more players could sit in. I have a strong visualization of how the hall should look.  I think the concept ties strongly to the Octet reading at CMW Saturday night.  I think some of the motivation is that so many people seem to appreciate the music we make, and we appreciate a live audience.  As word of the event got out, more players could join.

       I was thinking how fun it would be to have a candle light concert at our church in the fall or winter. I was thinking about focusing on a Baroque style, perhaps. We could announce it on WBJC! Or not. I don't know the rules regarding such activity in our church either. But I thought it would be a cool thing to do. An Episcopal church near us has frequent evening concerts. I think we should think about it at the very least. :)

       Hi everyone,  Let's plan for rehearsal at Triadelphia SDA this week.  Arrive at 6:45, set up, warm up, start practicing at 7:00.  Corey is very probably not playing with us this coming Sabbath, so I'll bring my tuba.  We can do most of the hymn arrangements with only four players.  And everyone lift up a brief prayer for Corey's swift recovery: it's no fun to have teeth pulled.

Life is going to be very complicated for me soon what with travel and such like and I need to give Xavier Covarrubias an answer so that he may tell his people.  Time grows short and expectations are long over due and out of control!!!!  Ahhh!  Run for the hills!  But first, tell me whether or not you are available on June 12.  Is that clear?  We're only 5 guys, we should be able to come to some sort of consensus on this.  Shouldn't we?

       OK--time to check in.  Jamie and I put in 20+ minutes this evening.  Friday included 30-40 minutes of trombone practice; Thursday had 5.  Before that, I don't remember exactly, but it wasn't much!  I've been mostly playing recorder sonatas on the trombone, since the range works out OK, if a bit low.  Keep on practicing, everyone!  Corey, hope you're up to it soon.  It'll be good to have you back.

What would the consensus be of asking them to come to our church?  Just checking.

       What a difference to experience the pure essence of a growing and maturing ensemble! I can not believe what a difference I heard this Sabbath Morning! You guys were fantastic. What a blessing to hear those hymns and spirituals being played with such spirit filled voice. I was sorry to sit this one out, but not really because I was able to really sense how far we have all been able to come with a little bit of concentrated effort.  I was telling Daniel the other Sabbath that I was so disappointed that I wasn't going to be able to continue practicing after my tooth got extracted because the last time I played I graduated into a new mouth piece bore that had been sitting waiting patiently in my case until I could loosen my lip again.  It was so painful to know that I was going to have to lay down the horn for a while to allow healing, but God knew that I needed to hear the four of you play to get my juices going again. It just was one more proof as to what our gift could be if we lay more at God's feet through practice and persistance.  Now onto other things, has anybody decided whether or not they would be available to play at the Washington Spanish Church on June 12?  Please let me know ASAP.  Otherwise we will be looking at a date passed July somewhere.

       Below you will find 3 selections from the pictures that were taken by Lucy Nueworth the Costume Lady (her own designation not mine) for the 3ABN show Kid's Time. (Thank you Daniel for posting them.)  Mark Feldbush and I were able to do 9 stories for them:  Miraculous Pots & Pans - Elisha and the Widow with the Jars King Jehosaphat – Returning from victory in Battle as the Lord had the musicians lead the army Ceiling Tiles – Jesus healing the paralized man A Baker’s Role – 2 stories, feeding of the five and four thousand  Road to Emmaus – Story of Passion Week The Rich Young Ruler – (Wouldn't explaining this story be redundant?) Paleg's Pitas - Tower of Babel  Noah's Sons – (Again redundant, no?)  This top picture is Uncle Japheth (me) & Uncle Shem (Mark) waiting to tell the story of the Ark.  In between us is Noah, a restless and outspoken child who was a great deal of fun working with :-)  Yes, his name really was Noah and the producers had us add it in.  One of many add ins I'm afraid.  :-}  Sorry, I should really keep on the sunny side. :-) :-) :-)  The bottom picture is us waiting for the "action" signal for Ceiling Tiles.  The middle picture is Mark waiting for me to change for the Ceiling Tiles sketch.  I'll keep you posted as to when air dates will be.  Thank you for all of the support as I went into this.  We needed all of the strength we could get.

        As mentioned in  urlLink this post , some people would receive a rejected e-mail after they posted to this weblog.  As it turns out, one of my upstream providers was doing spam filtering, and decided to reject any e-mails from the following domains unless delivered by a machine actually in that domain.   aol.com  hotmail.com  lycos.com  msn.com  yahoo.com  yahoo.com.hk  yahoo.com.tw   Because the messages were being sent from Blogger.com instead of from your actual e-mail server, they were being rejected.  I've asked to have Blogger.com added to the whitelist, and it appears that this has solved the problem.  If you get a bounced e-mail when you post here, please tell me.

       It is good to see that there will be a good representation to support Stan & Gen as they start out.  Stan says that he will be sending a schedule later on this week of events and such.  I will let you know as things progress.  By the way, Stan was able to take off Monday of this week so that he could be there to help Gen out with the last minute organization.  He told Christy and I when he phoned Monday before he left that he was so thankful to have had the Saturday night get together.  Also, when I saw him Sunday, he was bragging to Mom and Dad about his new gadget watch.  Thanks again to all those who helped make the gift and party arrangements.  It was very much appreciated.  I will be writing more here in a bit regarding the Washington Spanish Church info.  Please stay tuned. ;-)

       It looks like Hertz will charge us 29&cent;/mile, or about $320 more than quoted here, making a total of around $600 + gasoline.

        We need to clarify plans for traveling to Collegedale for Stan and Gen's nuptials.  Here's one way things could work out for the Ashton family:   Drive to Collegedale Friday night/Sabbath, leaving sometime late Friday afternoon or evening, trying to arrive before 6:00 PM.  Drive back Sunday night, leaving shortly after the wedding, trying to arrive before the workday begins.   We're pretty flexible with the scheduling.  It's not inconceivable that I could take a vacation day Friday or Monday if needs be.  We've talked about renting a larger vehicle so that we can carpool with more people in either or both directions.  David?  Jamey?  D2?  Others?  Post responses here and tell what schedule or plan works best for you.

       I promised Daniel that I would submit the time information here on the blog and then just after we spoke my whole world went into a spin.  So, now it is just 3 +/- hours until we meet and I am posting this info.  Better late than never I guess.  Xavier talked to me this morning about the best time to arrive.  He says the earlier the better.  Apparently, they have been holding an evangelistic series at their church and this is the last weekend of that series.  Throughout the series the parking has been a serious issue.  So, he recommended if we have bulky things to carry or would like to warm up, set up, and rehearse we need to be there by 8:30 am.  He will be there with a few others finishing the set up.  This is a bigger deal than I thought.  Xavier told me that this is not only recorded for the Church's use, but it will also be video/audio taped for broadcast satelite transmition to South America.  So, suck it in and look sharp, we are going live on tape tomorrow!  This is yet another reason to get there at 8:30 am for practice.  According to Xavier we are not the only music they will have, but it will be very clear in the program where we are to perform.  We are still doing the Offertory and a Special for church and one Special for Sabbath School.  If I think of anything else I will tell you tonight.  Right now I need to clean house.

       Is anyone interested in getting MDMUSIC plates for their car? Or whatever we decide to call our organization?   I called and confirmed that the number of members to get a special organization License Tag, is 25. I think we might be able to swing this. I am getting a booklet sent to me with the info for it. Probably will not have it by Friday night, but if I do, I will bring it and we can discuss it if anyone is interested.  Jamey

       We're thinking about getting [ahem]   personalized   plates for our new van.  I mean, since one of our strongest motivators in purchasing it was to be able to carry the tuba, the double bass  and  the children   all at the same time  , it seems appropriate to call it, maybe,   MUSIC VAN     [I've thought for a long time that I should have &nbsp;MUSIC MAN&nbsp; as my plates, but maybe this represents a little less hubris.]   The problem, of course, is that &nbsp;MUSIC VAN&nbsp; has nine characters, and Maryland plates have room for only seven.  What do to?  Here are some of the possible permutations:   MUSICVN    MUSCVAN    MSICVAN    MSC VN   What do you think?  Is any one of these obviously better than the others?  Maybe something completely different?  The application has room for four options, in order of preference.  Holla back now!

       I had an interesting thing happened today regarding my Tuba that I need some toss around time on.  Hope you guys can help me out.  Today I contacted Vince Simonetti of the Tuba Exchange http://www.tubaexchange.com to find out about replacement parts and a little history about my Tuba.  As it turns out, my horn is a F. E. Olds & Son Tuba circa 1966-1967.  The Fullerton, CA plant where my horn was made has now been closed and the company still exists, but under new management.  Anyway, to make a long story shorter, Simonetti said that he was very interested in my horn and would give me a half price trade in on  urlLink this ¾ size tuba .   What do you think?

       We are very seldom near the book store at a convenient shopping time, so it's not always easy for us to buy Worthington or La Loma products.  Here's what I'm thinking: If you're at the book store, grab a couple extra cans of something for us, and we'll be happy to more than pay you back the next time we get together.  Prime Steaks, Fri-Chik, Veja-Links, Chai Pow Yu or pretty much anything else.  Thanks!

       Hello friends,  This looks like a good week for chamber music after potluck.  Are you interested?  Bring instruments and music, and lets see what happens!  For those who have Trout or Hummel Septet recordings, listen up!  It really helps to know what the music sounds like.

Supper at the Ashtons (ask them how you might contribute)  Chamber music following supper, including the ever-popular Trout  Suggested lunch menu:   Strawberry shortcake  - Greenes   Sandwiches  - each bring enough to share   Chips  - each bring enough to share   Fruit and other picnic-friendly items  - welcome   Water  - each to his own    Special guest: Sherilyn Johnson, my mother   [Daniel adds the following:]  Supper is likely to be Pakistani Curry.  If, for any reason, this would discourage you from joining us, please speak up quickly!  We would far rather enjoy your company.  Please bring your parts for the Hummel Septet, as I want to have them in hand before leaving for CMW.  I believe that means flute and horn parts from the Maydens, and piano and viola parts from the Greenes.  Dooley is welcome.  Also, I really enjoyed the recorder trios, etc. that we played last time.  I hope we get to do more music like that.

       What a wonderful group of well wishers came to welcome in another year of Christy's lifetime.  Thank you all so much and I hope that we can do this again soon.  Well, the good bits.  (I'll let you sort out for yourselves which bits those were.)  Christy was still beaming when we got home and then crashed pretty hard.  Neither one of us was enthusiastic about rousing this morning, but life goes on.  This is a good thing with friends like you around.

       Further updates –  I just got off of the phone with Kevin, the Manager of the Cheesecake Factory Baltimore, and he confirmed that they only take reservations for the first seating of the day.  So, we are going to have a bit of a wait when we get there tonight.  I asked him how much of a wait to expect and he said around the hour of 7 pm a wait of 70-90 min is customary.  Nonetheless, Christy and I will be arriving around 6:30 or so and we will put in the reservation and we’ll see how long it takes.  If anybody can get there sooner, all the better.  From what I gather it will be 8 of us.  Is this right?  See you later.

       Alrighty then,  I guess comments have been long awaited.  So, let me see if I can rectify some things here.  First, I called again just now regarding reservations for tomorrow night.  I had been told when I first called that if we had a group of 7+ we could make reservations in advance.  As of today's call, that appears to not be the case.  Apparently, there are reservations taken from 11-11:30 am but after that it is a free for all.  So, I am working on a plan "B" so that we don't have to stay there all night waiting on a table.  Right now, this consists of Christy and me scuttling up there in advance and holding down the fort while others arrive in due course.  This may be the safest option considering Christy has a flexible schedule and I work closest to the ultimate destination.  As for the location, the Cheesecake Factory at Baltimore's Inner Harbor is located on Pratt St. The address is:  201 East Pratt Street, Baltimore, MD 21202 (410) 234-3990  Valet parking is available directly in front of the restaurant. Parking meters, garages and metered lots are located within easy walking distance of The Cheesecake Factory. Look for signs along East Pratt Street.  As for directions . . .  Merge onto I-95 N toward BALTIMORE.    Merge onto I-395 N via exit number 53 toward DOWNTOWN. 1.5 miles   Take the CONWAY ST exit. 0.1 miles   Stay straight to go onto W CONWAY ST. 0.2 miles    Turn LEFT onto MD-2 N/LIGHT ST. 0.1 miles  Go STRAIGHT. 0.1 miles  End at 201 E PRATT ST BALTIMORE MD  The Cheesecake Factory is located right on the Inner Harbor and directly in line with Barnes & Noble.  So if you are needing some excitement afterward, there are options available.  As for time, let us shoot for regular Brass Time, 7:00 pm and see how that goes.  All are welcome and we will be happy to see, and less likely to pay for, all of you.  Looking forward to it.  Christy is getting used to this idea of celebrating in a big group, so go easy on her.  She'll warm up to it, no doubt.

Therefore, I recommend that we forego our usual musical exertions in favor of camaraderie and the eating of cheesecake.  Details, Mr. Cottrell, we need details!

       William turns 12 this week, and he would like to see you folks.  Seeing as we will be seeing quite a few of you at brass rehearsal on Tuesday, I was wondering if it would make sense to do a little something downstairs afterwards.  No presents, just friends :-).  I'll bring some sculptured watermelon that we can stick candels in (he doesn't really like cake).  Perhaps we will have time to squeeze in a quick game of Uno, Catch Phrase, or something of that sort, he would really love that.  I will bring several things along just in case.  I would like to extend this to those of you who aren't brass memebers as well.  Rehearsal (which is at Triadelphia SDA Church) is usually over by 8:00pm so that gives you an idea of what time it would be.

       Yes, it is true.  We are back from the West Coast, although our bodies are still adjusting to the time change.  Granted it was only a few days, but still our bodies seem to adjust more quickly East to West than the other way round.  (It also helped us that we stayed up for nearly 24 hours on Thursday while traveling over.  We were good and tired by the time we crashed, so sleeping in that extra three hours was a necessity.  Good plan.)  Anyhow, are we Brassing tonight?  I have heard rumors that some of us are away, so it would seem “no” would be the answer.  Admittedly, I can’t play for another week anyway, if I am correctly following doctor’s orders.  I hate oral surgery!  I haven’t been able to play, or even take the horn out for a couple of weeks now!!!  Oi!  So, I guess unless otherwise noted we are off this week.  Let me be the first to say, I miss playing with you guys.  And, as it turns out, I may miss playing with you even more as of September, 2005.  (This is other news that was discovered while we were in Washington.)  Our Transportation staff was asked in by the Treasury Department last Thursday for lunch, and after the meal our department was subsequently let go as of September, 2005.  So, after the next Session I will be consequently unemployed.  Normally this would be bad news, but not in this case.  When we landed in Washington, Christy was hit hard with the home sick blues.  She asked me what we should do, and we both left it in the Lord’s hands.  Shortly thereafter I received a call, from our Assistant Manager with the news about our department being cut.  All of a sudden there was a world of possibilities.  We were already looking at taking off for Washington State that fall, but now it seems the Lord has opened wide that particular door and all we have to do is step through it.  (This may be slightly more complicated than it sounds, but we’ll see.  God has taken care of us so far, so we are trusting in Him to make the arrangements as smooth as possible.)  Christy and I will try to keep you all posted as things progress, but for now I will continue to polish the horn and practice as I can.  Looking forward to the next session.

        urlLink CMW : better than ever?  I think each year is better than the last, and that's saying something huge.  Are we essentially relegated to one CMW each year?  Are there things we can do locally to encourage, precipitate even, chamber music through-out the year?  What are we going to need to make it happen?  We have the Trout piano quintet, we have some Haydn string quartets, and a few Mozart piano quartets.  Are these enough to start bringing people together?  Can anyone get serious about buying string and flute music?  Can we find another strong violinist?  Geri, which string instrument will you learn first?  Should we start planning a recital?  If we do, will we feel awkward about playing together Sabbath afternoons?

       Hello friends!  Wes, David and Jason: Let's plan to meet as usual: 6:45 call time at the Triadelphia SDA church.  I have two new numbers for us to look at, too.  Corey, one of the new numbers is for bass (vocal) solo with brass and organ.  It's by Schütz, and in Latin.  The part looks difficult, but I'd like to hear you sing it if you're interested in the challenge.  Stop by rehearsal this evening to look at it with us.
