      Ok. My husband doesn't approve of all the blog reading I do. He is concerned that I might be "in search" of something. He sometimes has these moments of blind and pointless fear that I am going to leave him. (And here I could tell you the whole reason why--which has nothing to do with me--and everything to do with his own mixed up childhood--but I'm not because it's his story.)  I am not going to leave him.  I am not looking for anything like that.  But I certainly have to keep my blog a secret from him, because he would see this as an admission of a desire to be found.  Well that may be so. But not in the way he thinks.  I've been thinking about blogging. I totally believe that most bloggers (and here, even as a newbie I am including myself) share too much information.  Why do we do this. The people that know me well, would read this and know immediately who I am--either through my style , or my description of life events. Even today I feel compelled to wind out a story that is considered by myself and my husband to be knoweldge that we keep secret from the world. We DO NOT discuss it with others, we do no tell. (It is not Fight Club).  Are these secrets, taboo subjects, sharing of scatalogical and intimate behaviours an attempt at honesty and connection? I mean I have a bestfriend I tell more to than I should--isn't that pushing the envelope enough? Why do I feel compelled to tell total strangers, the internet, anyone with a computer-- secret stuff? Why is anyone interested? And certainly it can't be because we desire the advice and support of strangers. Too many of the blogs I read have talked about the ridiculous hate mail they get, the ridiculous advice. But aren't we asking for it by, posing our questions to the universe? Aren't we asking for it just in the act of telling?  Ok, I can't answer for everyone. So how did I get started. It took me two years--after I'd discovered blogging to start a site. Why do I think anyone cares what I have to say? (Evidently they don't as no one is reading yet--again with the hope).  I started with the  urlLink http://www.spoilerslayer.com . I'd become a Buffy fan after having my first child. (to those that are confused--the 9 year old is my stepson. The 3 year old is the first baby of my marriage.) I was a rabid fan. I started reading episode descriptions and posting on various boards about episodes. (The darling hubby didn't like that too much and was "mad" when he found that he liked Buffy too--aren't we too old for this we thought?)  From there it was a quick click to  urlLink http://www.tensdomain.com/ -- the owner of the Spoiler Slayer. His posts were intersting. His life COMPLETELy different from a middle aged stay at home mom. He had links on his site and I found  urlLink http://www.accidentaljulie.com . Julie seemed like me 10plus years ago. I lurked, occasionally posted and felt like a fool. I cheered her on and still do. I find her life interesting. When she got engaged I cried tears of joy for her--and for my own memory of my engagement. Is that it? Is it shared experiences? Is it living vicariously?  From there I fell down a rabbit hole on her links. I found a whole bunch of people in her circle interesting. Is it like eavesdropping? Is that it? I do that at restaurants. My husband can always tell when I have an ear turned towards the table next to us. Are humans just naturally snoopy?  I even found through this rabbit hole a girl I went to highschool with  urlLink http://www.thesoundandfury.net/ . Fascinating! I read her blog daily. I even posted and she sent me her email to catch up with her. I replied but got her email address wrong and so sent an extremely chatty and chock full of info email to a  complete stranger. I never tried to resend it--sorry Tina!  Tina is a big gateway to the world of blogging for me. After I cycle through a few of Julie's and her mutual friends I hit some of Tina's links. Most recently:  urlLink http://chezmiscarriage.blogs.com/ .  I am not infertile. In fact my husband and I are embarassingly fertile. He would be upset if I told you that he has never had the joy of having to "work" to get someone pregnant. Listen to me teenagers: it CAN happen the very first time. However, I read get up grrl and weep with her  as she travels on the roller coaster of trying to have kids. She rages at her situation and all the insensitive people in the world and I empathize with her. I think about posting on her site and stop myself because --MY GOD the woman has like 230 comments after every post. Does she really need ME to tell her RIGHT  ON! You go! And I don't want to say the wrong thing. It would be so easy to do so also--the thing I hate about this medium and emails in general is that you can't always tell if I'm being facetious, or ironic, or wry--and I could come across as just stupid.  And none of you  really  know me. So you can't tell.  Then one day, grrl posted about  urlLink http://www.dooce.com . And it's one more voice that I must check in on with regularity. Dooce is also a well read site--and for good reason. Through her I have found more than a half dozen other sites that I like to look at when I've got nothing better to do.  (SO once a week or so? And honestly I don't have the time to do this--so is that it? Is it that this is better than laundry, cooking or a billion other necessary tasks that  I'm procrastinating?)  So maybe it's about fame? Do I want 200 comments and help naming my daughter's privates? Not exactly.  I think maybe it's all of these things-- and maybe one or the other of them more than others on certain days.  Is it more than anything  else, Margaret Schlegel's admonishment (is that even a word?) to her husband--"you have only to connect" --in the great  Howard's End  by Forster?  Several of the blogs I read have talked about how important this is to them, how their blogging has bolstered them more than once when they were having a hard time of it. Is this something that started in America? (I really don't know.) Where we all finally feel we CAN have a voice--even if we can't elect a president. (And I better stop soon before I stop asking questions and start ranting.)  So I ask these questions of myself and of you. What am I doing here that I can't do in a diary? And why do I feel compelled to do it?  And so you know, my husband is a good man. He loves me and I him. He is not controlling. He just has a different comfort level with this than I do. And I feel guilty for doing this behind his back.

      Hiya empty infinity, sorry I've been away so long. Did you miss me?  The roller coaster soap opera that is my husband's employment is still in a state of flux. Today WAS his last day at the job. He has nowhere to go on Monday but the couch. I'll be in the corner slowly going out of my mind. We joked about it midweek--HE said that I would be calling my best friend and saying, "Help, there's an angry, white, unemployed, male on my couch. Can I come over!" I hope he wasn't looking for me to disagree because all I did was giggle my tuckus off. I love my husband and all, but he totally cramps my space when he's home all the time (we did this two summers ago--just LOVE this economy). I need time to miss him!  My bestfriend says she's expecting my call.  Meanwhile, we were hoping for a call today from the company that's been courting him for the last year. The company was having a meeting to discuss what they wanted to do at this point. They haven't called and I must say that my husband and I feel a bit like a prom date that saw the evening through and then never heard from him again. Still the meeting was in California where right now it's still early--Applies wishful lipgloss. My Hubster is out with the guys playing poker--and calling every hour to see if he's called--cue the stalker chorus!  I've been thinking about writing a children's book. A friend of mine in Houston told me she just pictured me writing a children's book about rabbits. Stray thoughts have been chasing their way through my head--like a sleeping dog, chasing rabbits. Both of my girls just crawled into my lap and demanded a story. I asked them if they wanted one about rabbits---"Yes," cried the three-year-old with glee.  I opened my mouth and nothing came out. When you're a housewife in suburbia, no one can hear you scream.  Happy Friday the Thirteenth to all.

      No one's reading (yet, she says hopefully) so I guess it's ok for me to spew a bit. . .  I had a big fight with the husband last night. We both behaved stupidly--we woke up still grumpy and unhappy. He went to work where the writing on the wall seemed to be glaring down at him. They won't be needing his services much longer. SO we've had to put the fight behind us and try to face the coming weeks together. Which is on the one hand a good thing when your grown up lives force you to be--well, grown up. On the other hand, I wasn't quite finished being angry. I hadn't won my point, proved my case, dusted the opposition.  I like a good fight and have a good chance at winning by my shear willingness to beat the crap out of a dead horse so that the other person just wants me to GO AWAY.  In fact, one day if I'm not careful, my husband is going to change the locks and have that song blasting out of the window as I try to get in to the house. You know the song: Girl don't go away mad, just go away.  That will be sad, because I really do love my husband. He's a good man and about as perfect as I am--so we're well suited. You decide whether I'm complimenting us or not.  I hurt for him, I'm scared for our family. I went by the library where I used to work--because right now I can't afford books--and it made me sick inside. Hind sight is such a cruel gift.  In other news, the Baby is still holding the keys hostage somewhere in the house, the 3 year old refuses to wear her glasses opting instead for her broken strawberry shortcake sunglasses which aren't helping her amblyopia at all and make her look a bit eccentric. I like the 9-year-old a lot today--he was helpful and sweet at the library and thoughtfully told me that I should try what he got at Sonic today another time, because I would like it. I'm just looking for a little kindness here! Thank you 9-year-old.  And thanks to Sonic for their mood-lifting Vanilla cokes. It's the small things in a small life like mine, you know?

      As if the previous post weren't enough, the damn baby (LOVE HER!) has taken her favorite toy, which just happen to also be my keys to the car, house, and mailbox and LOST. THEM.  Why oh why didn't I take them from her yesterday when I saw her teething on them and thought "Hmmm, I should really take those away from her."  Oh yeah, because I knew the crying and squalling that would follow and I had a migraine. OK, but where are the keys, Baby? The other kids want to go to the swimming pool.  Help, I'm being held hostage by a 9 month old, she's revoked my key privileges!

      In the category of putting all our eggs in the one basket we own and counting them before they've hatched:  So my hubby has been chasing down this job for like a year. They keep telling him how much they want him--they wine him and dine him. They invite him to play poker and tell him every once and a while what they will pay him when they can hire him. It's all been like an endless and wonderful first date.  A few months ago, we decided this job was a done deal. That the time before it would happen was limited--we felt the proverbial writing was on the wall! So I quit my job (where I was unhappy and growing an ulcer) to be home with the kids. We had some savings to get by on and I would start my own business from home--which is going well if not super profitably.  And then we were told that really the letter was drafted and we were just awaiting a rubber stamp. That the rubber stamp would happen this past Monday. There was much rejoicing at my house! We felt that truly the righteous were about to be rewarded! We had made a GOOD decision for our children, giving them their mother at home! We had made a good decision by continuing to chase this elusive but desirable job. We were GOOD people who deserved GOOD things.  We were thinking of how that basket would one day be joined by another much fancier basket and maybe a pot in which to piss! Oh happy days!  Well there was no rubber stamp. Just more disappointment. (I did however finally get a dessert from one of the fancy pants places they take him too--creme brulee. It only took a year and my finally saying--"hey you only take me to China Buffet and Sonic when is this company going to show me some love?")  We are three months in to my not working and the savings have dwindled. We have a marginal return on my business that we will use to make it to his next paycheck.  At my house we are currently perfecting the body contortions necessary for kicking oneself.

      I have spent a lot of time reading other's blogs. The stories are all interesting, some of them poignant and touching, some of them uproariously funny, some of them by excellent writers, and some by excellent observers.  I don't know which one I want to be more. I once wanted to be a writer. To do that you must write. I don't do that much anymore. But something has been calling out to me from the blogs of others. I want to shine a light on myself--the interrogation light of the police, the soft light of morning as it creeps into the rooms of my children, the candlelight of first romance (hi honey,  I love you)--the fleeting light of inspiration--that elusive spark.  Perhaps this blog will help me to get a fire going--what the hell am I saying? I'm a Mom I have so many fires and so many irons in them--CRAP, I don't have time for a blog.  Oh well, I started one. Do you ever finish?
