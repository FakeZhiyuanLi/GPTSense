      lam mo.. sa lahat ng cosmo books.. un ung hindi masyadong nag focus sa love.. it's more of.. self-actualization and faith!! it's a good book coz there are a lot of things that i realized to be true.. like, for example... "absence is presence".. not because you can't see a thing doesnt mean they're not there.. like God, for an instance! another, is that, we should know what we really want, kz we'll end up not being happy.. we should not stick to things or persons that we're used to specially wen we're dissatisfied.. bkt pa magtitiis, ayt? palitan na, kung dapat palitan.. the author used mangoes for this one, hehe!! i can say that somehow... nakarelate ako!!!

      that's what im currently reading.. i can say that i progress very slowly.. not that i dont understand it.. i just cant relate to it!! but it has a lot of good words of wisdom that i can relate to... somehow!! though im halfway through it...  here's what i learned.. as of now!!  *The joy of intimacy is the reward of commitment  *Intimacy without commitment, like icing without cake,  can be sweet, but ends up making us sick.  *Be careful what u wish for.. (nabasa ko na rin to sa princess diaries.. wen mia wished for a bf and realized dat she cant love him bak.. she said be careful wat u wish for, it myt come true.. nakarelate ako jan)  *Being in love is a patchwork of many indescribable moments..  *THE RIGHT THING AT THE WRONG TIME.. IS THE WRONG THING! (i totally believe this.. at sobrang nakarelate ako.. kung pano? ask nyo c krishna..)  *YOU DON'T NEED TO SHOP FOR WHAT YOU CANT AFFORD! (i explained this to krishna.. nakarelate sya.. haha!! alam ko kung bkt..)  un lng muna.. hehe..

      ... Dont put limits on urself.  Many dreams are waiting to be realized. Decisions are too important to leave to chance. reach for ur peak, ur goal, ur prize...  yes, i did limit myself from doing something! so dumb of me to do that!! that's why i never had the chance to be happy with THAT thing.. i hindered myself of something that i know would really make me happy.. and now., it's gone!!   hehe.. that was something of the  past ..  totally buried!  just reminiscing bout it.. dont u wori!!!  never limit urself.. spread your wings!!!

      yay!! i'm going to school on monday!! im so excited.. i realle, really am!! i wanted to wear na my new school uniform coz it's color green! i cant imagine myself wearing that with matching doll shoes and all.. what would i do with my hair? should i wear it down, or should i tie it in a pony? i'm so jittery bout my first day!!! actually, i just wanted to be soooo busy, that i would forget bout whatever's bothering me... my classes on monday starts at 10:30...  another yay!! coz my family and i is going to tagaytay tomorrow! i just wish that cheska could come so that there would be someone i could talk to, or maybe i could just sleep.. hehe.. that would be better!!!   everytime my family goes to tagaytay, i make sure that i always come along.. the place is sooo peaceful! but what i like most about going to tagaytay is when we visit the convent of the pink sisters, and my cousins joke about leaving me there so that i can focus with what i really want and start my vocation, my RELIGIOUS vocation.. and there's this church that i really cant forget... CALERUEGA CHURCH!! it's quite small but the scenery is breath-taking... it's in, i think..., nasugbu, batangas..!!  before u can even reach the church, you'd be so tired, but it eventually pays off! i think that is where sandy andolong and christopher de leon got married..

      krizia texted me if krish and i could come and accompany her at the hospital.. we came.. though i'm not that well! i think i just needed to get out of the house and find someone to talk to, take time to breathe air.. we exchanged stories for a while, then i dozed off to sleep.. i wasnt really feeling well!   krish asked me if we could have something like a "huling-hirit" before classes start on monday.. well, i dont know if we could still do that! im about to go to tagaytay with my family, but im not that sure if that would be tomorrow or on sunday!!

      Lately I have had this strangest feeling, with no vivid reasons here to find. Yet the thought of losing's been hanging, round my mind... Far more frequently you're wearing perfume, with you say, "No special place to go" But when I ask will you be coming back soon, you don't know, never know.  Well, I'm a man of many wishes, I hope my premonition misses, but what I really feel, my eyes won't let me hide, cause they always start to cry. cause it's time could mean goodbye.  Lately I've been staring in the mirror, very slowly picking me apart. Tryin' to tell myself I have no reason, with your heart. Just the other night while you were sleeping, I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name. But when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping, you just say, nothing's changed.  i really like this song!! katrina introduced this song to me.. when we were at manila pavillion!!! these past few days.. this song has been lurking in my mind... it just cant get out!! this song is by stevie wonder....

      yah, that's ryt!! still am sick! and that's the reason why i cant accompany krizia today at the hospital, she, too, is taking care of someone just like krishna.. but at least im expecting a visitor.. yay!! krishna's visiting me later, i hope.. and i pray!! coz i believe in brit's song.. "my loneliness is killing me.." and that's what makes me sad.. i have no one to talk to, no one to share gossips with.. no one to eat with.. haii!! that's why my friends usually come over whenenever im alone because being alone feels deppressing or me.. but sometimes being alone feels good coz i learn to face everything alone..sometimes!! and when we are together we pig out, we sing along with our videoke, we surf the internet, and the usual chismisan!! oh my, how i miss that!!   my cousins started school last tuesday, so im left alone with thalia!!

      its already 1:00 am and i'm still wide awake.. i was in the middle of watching A Knight's Tale when i suddenly had the urge to turn off the tv, go to our room and catch some zzz's.. hopefully!! but i cant even shut my eyes.. i even begged my cousin, cheska, to tell stories bout what happened today at her school, but she refused!   so here i am, thinking of what to write about..   just a thought... why do i let people demand from me? why cant i coerce myself to fall asleep? why cant i just close my eyes and just dream? why is it a sin to sleep late at night?  is it hard to say bye to someone ure talking to like wen ure on the phone or somethin? is it polite to start a conversation and end it impolitely? do you just leave them there? do you think thinking of the answers to all these questions will make me fall asleep?  can u answer all of these for me???

      im sick!! i cant go out of the house.. my friend krishna wont even visit me, she says that she cant leave the hospital, she's currently taking care of her grandma!! i was sleeping the whole day.. if it wasnt for katrina, i would still be sleeping.. i heard her saying something like.."ano ba yan c jan, tulog pa rin hanggang ngaun!!!" i dont have anything to do..   im really bored, though i know that starting next week i will become REALLy busy and my life would make a 360 degree turn.. why? because my classes are up to 7:30 pm.. that sked is for M, TH,and F.. i even have saturday classes.. to tell you honestly.. i am a morning person, i easily wake up early if needed.. i wish i had gotten a better sked, just like that of krizia.. but my sked was like.. whoa!!! when i saw it written at my reg. form.. i almost gone ballistic.. i said something like this to my cuz.. "7:30!! who are they kidding?!" and to think that trinity college is not that close to our home.. and it's always jampacked with cars.. and strange things happen along españa (according to some sources).. grrr...  why does suddenly our dog, thalia, makes pa-cute to me?

      just had a new haircut.. yay!!! it was waaayyy shorter than the one i had before.. i told the guy to just cut off at least an inch.. now.. its about.. uhmm.. shoulder length.. i was dissapointed for a minute.. but hey! it was good!!!  but i think it would be hard to tie it up in a ponytail.. i'll try my best though, coz its a requirement for zoology lab for girls to tie their hair..   just for you to know.. krishna had her hair cut too.. but mine was shorter.. unfair!!!

      i dont think i can come with my family to tagaytay coz i still have colds and if i dont rest, i might not be able to go to school on monday!! so.. what am i suppose to do?!   i had some catching up with camille earlier this day.. i didnt feel like staying at home.. so we went to sm mla, then krish met us there!! they made comments about me that i was full of energy! because i easily notice things, react, and even make fun of it.. while we were there, we were looking for pencil cases that we could bring to school, unfortunately, we did not find the one that suits us!! i also bought something for myself.. a journal.. or should i say a neon green journal, according to krish!! though it was not that neon-y!! she's so fascinated bout the story that she posted just the other day, that she easily notice things that are colored green.. what's up with that?! ive read the story.. didnt know that krish wasnt only good at making poems but also with stories..   also had dinner with my family.. we wanted to watch any movie, but we did not make it to any LFS..

      uhmm... as i was on the way to school.. i saw another person from my past.. well... she's an enemy.. that was before though.. way back in high school.. had petty fights with her and her "girl friend/s?".. but im ready to move on and forget bout those "misunderstanding" that we had in the past..   just a thought.. what if all my enemies come together and get back at me?! whatever.. i wouldnt even give a damn.. why am i so bothered?! i should have started a new life when i entered college.. well i did.. it was just a thought..  krizia and i went home together.. it was really hard getting through all of these things.. assignments, etc... without my friends! coz i was used to have them with me all the time! now, theyre nowhere to be found... too bad..   i feel agitated bout how badly things turned out for me because of the indecisions i made in the past.. These misfortunes that im experiencing.. they are the result of lack of ability, ignorance, laziness, wrong decisions, etc... the results of the mistakes ive made.. the results of deciding too soon..  well.. i really like this song by Avril.. dont know why!! Happy Ending....  Let's talk this over  It's not like we're dead  Was it something I did?  Was it something You said?  Don't leave me hanging  In a city so dead  Held up so high  On such a breakable thread   You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be   CHORUS:  You were everything, everything that I wanted  We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it  All of the memories, so close to me, just fade away  All this time you were pretending  So much for my happy ending  oh oh, oh oh, so much for my happy ending Oh oh, oh oh  You've got your dumb friends  I know what they say (they say)  They tell you I'm difficult  But so are they (so are they)  But they don't know me  Do they even know you?  All the things you hide from me  All the shit that you do  (all the shit that you do) You were all the things I thought I knew  And I thought we could be   [CHORUS]   It's nice to know that you were there  Thanks for acting like you cared  And making me feel like I was the only one  It's nice to know we had it all  Thanks for watching as I fall And letting me know we were done   He was everything, everything that I wanted  We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it  All of the memories, so close to me, just fade away  All this time you were pretending  So much for my happy ending   ooopss.. bye!! still have to do my psych assignment...

      cant think of an appropriate title... though this day was quite different..  while in the fx upon going to school.. (yes! i did have my class since my school is in qc...) i saw someone from my past.. but i did not talk to that person since i was inside the vehicle.. and even if i wasnt!!  i saw gurkirpal AGAIN!! he approached me coz i was alone while waiting for my friend, jodette!!  i was half-asleep during my biblical studies class.. but i had a longer last night than the night before.. why's that?!   i had an argument with a guy classmate who wasnt even close to me.. i dont like the way he talked to me.. he was shouting!! he keeps mentioning my name.. as if it was the first time he knew a girl named alex!! he really got to my nerves...  i reached home at about 7:35.. i was really happy coz i have a new cabinet.. now i can organize my things.. yay!!!

      if there's one way i would like to express my thoughts and ideas.. it is through writing!! i was an associate editor for our school paper last year..   i saw through an announcement that the trinity observer, tcqc's official paper, is having a training for next year's staffer.. i really wanted to join.. but i do not know how.. i dont even know where their office is.. i know im too busy to have an extra co-curricular activity but writing is one way of relieving stress for me..   wish i could find time for that..

      i had only a 4 hr. sleep.. woke up at 5 am so that ill be able to reach school at 7 coz my group is having a practice for our filipino presentation.. the one that we presented in bisaya!! our psych class was fun.. i also attended the opening service for trinity college.. though it was halfway through when we got to the cathedral.. it was a mass, but with differences.. they dont have a communion rite..   as i was about to exit, i saw pal, my high school classmate.. well, who would miss a guy like pal.. i learned from him that fatima arribe was at trinity too, fatima is a former classmate from grade skul.. i also saw krizia with her hair parted sideways..  i did my english assignment at carls jr. during our break.. i ate... uhmm.. pork bbq rice bowl, brownies and fries.. hehe!!!  i was dismissed at 4:30 but i left school at 6:00.. why wait that long?! just so you would ask... i waited for abu!!! i didnt take it badly though.. because he reasoned out that there was traffic along e. rod or something... but as far as i can remember... it was the longest time i waited... alone!!! but its okay... we went to sm mla.. its been quite a while since we got together..  krishna and camille texted me a while ago.. its been ages... its about time.. but as usual we still cant find time to go out together.. oh my!! how i miss them...  i really envy my friends who dont have classes tomorrow... since i study at qc.. haii.. its okay.. ill have my turn..  think thats all for now..  muah!! still have to do my algebra assignment..

      i tried the love oracle at the  urlLink seventeen website !! and this is what it said...  Beware! You're in for quite the pickle. Nettles, or grass burrs, or other sticky things that attack shoelaces and bare toes while exploring the outdoors mean that you're going to be a hot item — for several guys. At once. All the boys will be demanding your attention, and they'll all seem like great options. The jock, the loner, the bad boy, and the sweetheart will all want a little piece of your time. You won't know what to do. Your girlfriends won't know what to tell you. You'll have to go it alone and weigh everybody equally. Your judgment will prevail, however, and you'll be thrilled with the one you finally choose.   shocks... hot item daw oh?! yah ryt!!   masaya ko ngaun.. aS in!! i dont know.. i just feel that everything went right for me today..  i had the continuation of my exam for trinity observer.. and i met this really cool guy.. his name is gerard, the managing editor! he's a 3rd yr bs bio student.. ambait nya.. kc kahit na nsa editorial board na xa parang wala syang kaere-ere!! ang daldal nga nya eh kahit na nagrereview sya.. tapos pag nakaside-view para syang si piolo.. he even gave me tips.. nakaka-entertain sya kahit na naiwan na kming dlawa dun sa room.. pati ung moderator na-meet ko na rin.. how i wisah makapasok talaga ko sa t.o.!!

      i went to sm mla earlier in the day.. i bought new pair of shoes, i.d. protector for me and jodette, staple wires, invisible tape and toothpaste that i could bring to school!! krishna wasnt able to come along with me.. i understood that she was tired because of her pe.. they did the shuttle run and a lot of push-ups...   still she went to fetch me at our house and then went to ns.. ate millet didnt allow us to come inside since there was a teacher's meeting.. so we waited outside.. while waiting.. we were amused with our enemies.. the young ones.. i feel really irritated with just the sight of their faces.. if only i could write their names here.. they're still young and they act as though we're at the same level (literally speaking or not!).. my advice to those girls: "you're still young, do not waste your time on us.. act your age!! do not underestimate us.."  saw a lot of people..   benjie: i was chatting with him just the other day, he was telling me that i didnt reply to any of his messages...   joanne: i missed her so much.. i didnt notice her though she was large.. just kidding.. luv u!!!  arvin: he said hi.. i didnt notice him coz i was busy talking to benjie...  justine: she forgot to bring along the pics that i was asking her to bring..   katrina, angelica, april and the rest: they teased me that it was my bday (29) so i have to treat them... yah ryt?!   didnt get to speak to mrs. flores coz we didnt see her going home.. so our visit to our old school was useless.. haii!! but it made me happy.. whatever the reason behind my happiness is... it's between me and krishna..   somehow, after all that im going through ryt now, with all the things going round and round my mind, i still have a reason to smile.. :)

       urlLink krishna  and  urlLink krizia  paid me a visit.. at last! i did a little favor for krishna, so she came here to pick it up! krizia asked me to help her with her philosophy talk show.. i did her script for that.. we have agreed that we'll go home together every friday!! yay!!   we realized that we still have about an hour before krish goes home.. so we decided to go to dotcom.. saw  urlLink bonn  and had a little chat with him..   also txted camille and we decided to meet on sunday to watch spiderman 2 with jc.. i really hope that krizia, krish and alvin could come... krish wanted to have a videoke session but because there's only three of us, we did not have it! maybe next time.. when all of us are free..   haii.. the night of the champions concert is already on saturday.. never had the time to buy the ticket and some unexpected events happened, so? i had to change plans.. i'll never get to see erik santos..   cheska told me that she dreamt that i was dead.. that's why when she woke up, she immediately looked for me and saw that i was still sleeping.. she told me that my friends visited my wake.. she even named them.. i told her to stop.. coz i was getting the "goosebumps"!!   here's another song that i really love at the moment aside from i dont wanna know...  Notice me Take my hand Why are we Strangers when Our love is strong Why carry on without me?  Everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  I make believe That you are here It's the only way I see clear What have I done You seem to move on easy  I may have made it rain Please forgive me My weakness caused you pain And this song is my sorry  Ohhhh  At night I pray That soon your face Will fade away  owww.... congratulations to the winners in the last concluded NSSC elections at Nazareth School!!

      before i went to school, i passed by allied bank to deposit a little amount of money to my account.. i was so irritated because the teller was very slow.. to think that it was already 12:15 and my p.e. class starts at 1:00!! but fortunately, e. rod and espana wasnt that jampacked.. i was there in time.. whew!!  me and my groupmates namely, ruth, jodette, julienne, george, carlo and daryll, started our presentation for our practical exams next wik.. it was a combination of axial and locomotor movements.. it really felt good to actually move my body once again coz for the past 3 months, exercise for me would be standing and walking!! we presented the first two figures and the prof. told us that it was good.. yay!!!  group 1 started with their reporting in nstp.. i wasnt actually listening.. me and redgie was listening to the radio on my cellphone, all we did was listen to the music and copy whatever is on the visual aid.. but when we had the quiz, the result was 20/20.. that's the advantage of friends sitting together.. well, to tell the truth, almost all of 1NU24 got perfect scores...  i was supposed to go to nazareth school to attend a meeting for the sat review to be conducted to the 4th yr students but i wasnt able to come because of the difficulty of finding a ride home.. and i remembered that i have saturday classes.. so? what's the point of attending the meeting if i wont be able to come every saturday?! richard and i agreed that the first jeepney or fx that has two seats available passed by us, we'll ride it! he lives at quintos sr.! he rides the same way as i do.. the time we waited for a ride was longer than the actual time we spent in going home.. haii..

      i went to school early to pay my tuition but unfortunately the pc at the cashier's ofc has broken down.. and they advised me to come back after lunch.. too bad!!! then i found out that my friends totally forgot that there was an assignment for zoo lec.. since i was too generous.. i let them copy.. just my closest friends..   i got 51/54 for my first algebra quiz.. well, that's an achievement.. but what bothers me sooo much is my zoo lab.. i know that i didnt do good at our practical exams a while ago.. i need prayers to make a miracle out of my grades... to reach the quota of 2.00...    i promised my mom that i'll do good... i know that it's not too late.. my mom even gave me tips about the glass slides... damn those microscopes that make my eyes really teary.. how i hate them.. and i cant even draw the specimen,... but since a promise is a promise.. haii...   i need divine intervention..

      hurray for my psych quiz!! i got 9/10!! i was expecting the quiz to be much longer because of the coverage of the topics.. but then.. 9 is a good grade.. jodette, too, got nine points! we had this commercial thingy about abortion.. i was the one who conceptualized ours.. but i still think it was mediocre!! i think i have too to review more on this subject coz ive been getting average grades.. haii..  i had lunch at kenny rogers with jodette.. we wanted to taste something new.. (hindi maganda ung paulit-ulit na lng..) i didnt like the chocolate cake.. it was dry!! (sayang chocolate lover pa naman ako..)  i asked redgie to help me with our algebra assignment (my fave subject? yah ryt!!).. and he said, "sure.. cge..".... i also asked him to come a little bit early tomorrow for that!! you know, he's really good in math! he got a perfect score on our first quiz, same with richard.. while i got one problem wrong! *sighs*  krishna went to our house this afternoon to borrow a book for her book report.. she borrowed both the count of monte cristo and the breakup diaries.. she still has to present the book to her english teacher for approval.. we went to alvin's house to give the eco book that april needed, saw krizia there.. ate at brgy. 407, then went to dotcom to research for her project.. i missed her a lot.. i also missed camille specially now that she lives at q.c.!!  when i got home.. i reviewed for zoology!! hope that i pass this quiz.. i really need to..  i hope it doesnt rain tomorrow.. its the only thing that might ruin my day.. well except for my zoo lab.. tsk tsk tsk!!!

I LOVE YOU TOO PRINCE!!! thanks for everything.. i do agree, a relationship is like a rose... a pink rose.. thanks!!

      i really find it hard deciding nowadays.. remember my previous blog?! the one with the "answered prayer"?! it affects every move i make.. everything i think or do depends on that.. everything's becoming soooo complicated.. even the smallest and easiest decision!!! haii..   "the measure of your life is the love you leave when you're gone!" remember this quote?! this is from sana'y wala ng wakas.. i didnt like the ending.. i really want ara for leo.. they look good together..  i havent watched mean girls.. i still have to find time for that considering that my prelims will start on july 19.. i have to review especially for zoology..

       jodette was right!!! it is indeed an odd day today.. let me recall the things that happened today...    &nbsp;  my mom called right before i went to school.. we were talking bout "someone"!! someone very special to me.. nanibago ko coz.. i didnt realize that she was openly agreeable to that person.. kaya pla lagi na lng namin napaguusapan.. kaya pla she wants me to study hard and then transfer to up manila.. para daw my ksabay na ko pumasok..as if!! trinity nga lng hirap na ko.. dun pa kya!!!    &nbsp;  i didnt make it on time to school.. me, jodette and krislen agreed to go there earlier but because of the phone call that i received, i was late!!!     &nbsp;  there is something peculiar with these 2 classmates of mine.. i wont give names,.. but ive been noticing it these past few days.. ill give details later!!!    &nbsp;  but what made this day extra odd is that.. jodette actually told me that i was really kind and that i was really a true friend.. because i trusted her.. its only been like 1 month or so that weve known each other.. i let her borrow my other cellphone.. and since it was just given to me by mom (who live in the states).. we cant open the phone.. she thanked me and i told her that it was nothing because it didnt help her at all.. she immediately replied that"it's the thought that counts".. she even thanked me for being there (maybe because i always accompany her whenever she looks for her boylet..).. tsk tsk tsk!!!

        i havent blog for like a... a week!!  and that's a record .. i had a temporary vacation from blogging because of my preliminary exams earlier this week!! it was so tiring.. having to review all the time!  it totally sucks!!  when i was in high school, i only scan my book,, then that's it!! but ive changed.. i even made reviewers for my subjects!!     &nbsp;   krishna was like... "whoa!!! you made reviewers for these subjects" she went here last tuesday to treat me out.. coz i did her a  "little"  favor!!! yah ryt?! little? i even got colds because of that... i told her that i needed a break from the reviewing that i did.. so we watched never been kissed!! honestly, it was the first time i watched that flick!! sobra kong kinilig.. maybe because i was really tired.. haii.. david arquette really looks good.. krishna just had to agree with that!!!     &nbsp;   jodette's fone was lost a while ago.. inside burger king.. everything happened so fast!! i did pity her coz she was crying!! there was this creepy gut who tagged me and told me that my 20 peso bill dropped.. i told him that it wasnt mine,.. but he insisted.. then after 5 mins.. i told jodette to see if ruby texted.. then that was the time we realized...  it was gone!!!  just like that!!!     &nbsp;   have to go.. blog later!!! miss u ol!!!!

       went to school with krizia.. it was only now that we realized that our monday 10:30 class is on the same bldg. and floor.. hehe!! hindi man lang namin nakikita ang isat isa..     &nbsp;   a sad day it is!!       &nbsp;  i really find it hard to smile.. to laugh.. i was soooo sleepy!! specially during our c.e. class!! the aircon was in my direction.. "thanks" to martin who was seated beside me.. jodette even had to transfer to another seat because she's not feeling well.. redgie was in a world of his own.. he's not talking to anyone!! jodette and i wasnt in a good mood.. but right before zoo she saw her "crush" and drag me to the canteen just to get a closer glimpse.. sumakit talaga ung paa ko.. at mejo sumama na rin pakiramdam ko nun!! but i remember laughing before i went home.. when redgie blurted something about jodette leaving him after he waited for her..     &nbsp;   passed zoology lec prelim..       &nbsp;  you read it right.. i got 66/75!! it was quite a good grade.. im really contented.. it became my inspiration to study hard.. im really happy about that!!    &nbsp;   bout the frog       &nbsp;  we started coloring the skeleton of the frog.. we'll start the dissection next week.. im really anxious!! both excited and nervous.. im excited in wearing my new laboratary gown.. hehe!!!

       i really dont know how to describe this day!! i woke up late today.. it sucks coz i really dont want to be in a hurry!! sobrang nagmamadali ako.. i was sitting between two big guys in the fx and it made the ride to school really uncomfortable!!     &nbsp;   my professor returned our drawings(brain) for psychology.. my grade was 94%!! fair enough.. we didnt have economics class today. whatever the reason is, all of us were too happy to even find out because we wont have our filipino, too.. so we had a 4 hour break!! jodette and i ate at chowking and surfed the internet for an hour.. it made our eyes really tired and we feel sleepy!!     &nbsp;   i wasnt paying attention to my philosophy teacher.. i was too busy talking to redgie.. di lng pala sya puro kalokohan.. he talks with sense, a lot of sense.. eventhough he was sleepy and all..     &nbsp;   jodette and redgie changed their clothes at our house.. they both live in rizal.. redgie was really sleepy.. we can really see it so we let him lie down for a while in our room.. "tama bng gawing sandalan ang likod ko at relax na relax pa sya?!"     &nbsp;   the concert was alright.. though i stayed with my hyskul friends.. gusto ko rin sana makasama ang 1nu24 kaso di pwede sabay eh.. people were jumping and singing.. i was contented coz i heard them sing "love of my life" that was their opening song..     &nbsp;   im really deppressed.. there's something heavy in my chest!! i dont know if that is because of the exhaustion inside noble gym.. i just had to get that out.. i dont have an "outlet" available right now.. but ive tried telling it to some friends.. i am just not sure if they understood me.. i think ill just focus mainly on my studies..     &nbsp;   god, please be with me...

        midterms       i'm gonna start reviewing for my midterms.. i cant afford to fail a test.. the subjects that i have to really focus on are: philosophy and algebra.. i think im doing just fine with the other subjects!! please pray that i may pass all of my tests...       movies galore..     ive started watching  ella enchanted  on dvd last thursday but unfortunately i wasnt able to finish because of some unlucky circumstances.. my tito suddenly wanted to watch westlife's concert.. and who am i to object?!   me and abu watched  eternal sunshine of the spotless mind  yesterday.. elijah wood looked good in that movie.. i also saw the trailer of  the notebook  and i think that it's gonna be a nice movie though i havent read the book.. we watched  city of god  for our english class a while ago.. it's a spanish movie.. we havent finished yet.. the movie was not meant for an innocent child.. not that it's pornographic (though it has a little of that!), but it's about a little community run by gangsters who sell drugs, kill people anytime they want..       belated happy birthday!!!      belated happy birthday to my prince whom i sooooo dearly love.. i do hope that you liked my gift!! thanks for treating me out yesterday..       cliche as it may sound, but i certainly hope that you get the best of everything! muah!!

       i had a lot of fun during our psych class.. our prof. showed us pictures that would reveal other images.. i dont know if there's anything wrong with my brain that it could not perceive things, or with my eyes that i could not see it properly, or i was just too close to the monitor.. haii!! but it was fun though!!  we didnt have our english class, i dont know why.. it's the third time that sir ronald did not come!! so we just did our psych assignment, the blindfold thing.. jodette was my partner! i was the one blindfolded.. and i can say that it was very hard.. i had to rely on jodette's directions!! we went up then went out of the bldg.. after a while, jodette let go of my hand and i went hysterical.. i touched a hand.. then i felt that it wasnt jodette's.. so i shouted louder.. then i felt someone pinch my arms very hard.. i removed the blindfold..  the experience was really exciting but straining to the eyes!! huh?!  i went home early to review for the practical exam tomorrow..  i just finished watching "a beautiful mind", courtesy of joanne, i was deeply touched by the movie.. i decided to borrow it because my psych prof. always talks bout that movie.. and i cant relate!! i was moved by that movie coz the wife never left john nash despite his disorder (schizophrenia)...

       look at the new pic at the side of your screen.. that picture was taken right after i cried like a little baby begging for milk because of what happened last saturday and the other problems that contribute to it.. see how my eyes have been puffed up?! how it became that dark because of the sleepless nights?!       do you know what i realized after that day?!       wanting to cry, to let your tears wash away all your frustrations, is just as difficult as trying to hide it from everyone.. get it?      last friday, i really wanted to cry.. i can feel it.. but everytime the teardrops become very close to "falling from my eyes".. it backs out.. then last saturday.. i really tried hiding my tears because i dont want a lot of people to witness me, crying!!       i dont want anyone to know my weakness (well..except for the chosen few!!), i dont want people to know what makes me cry!! but what's the point of publishing it here?! boohoo!!

       our c.e. teacher wasnt here.. so we were led to the avr to watch  the holy scriptures !! we were asked to react on the movie!! though i was sleepy, i was devotedly watching it!! thank god i wasnt called to recite for math.. i have this really big  "singaw"..  in my tongue!!! so my mouth movement is limited and i cover with my hanky!!      i ate chocolate overload.. so.. somehow.. i forgot about my worries!!      i think,,, i answered my zoology quiz quite fairly.. i wasnt talking much during our zoology lab.! i was covering my face half the time.. coz my prof. was already distributing the frogs for dissection.. it made me feel a bit ill!!      i would just like to wish  camille ,,, luck!!! not only with her studies but also with her new " kinacareer ",, i mean  career !! to  krishna,,,  i really cant understand.. why r u stil single?! to  krizia,,,  thanks for everything.. gud luck!! i love you guys..      to my  trinity friends .. jodette, krislen, redgie.. whom i share my problems with!! thanks.. the problems im talking about are,,,, assignments, seatworks, and the likes!!!      ive already finished watching  crouching tiger, hidden dragon  (thanks to abu)..        "what really makes wishes come true.. is the trust in your heart!!"          "Id rather be a ghost floating at your side... ...than enter heaven without you!!"         id better go.. dont wanna get sick!!

       yes.. ive got my fingers crossed!! i have a lot of things to bring to school today.. lab. gown, dissecting kit, frog skeleton, etc.. i dont want them to get soaked in the rain knowing that i get into these  "clumsy moments"  with my umbrella..        but now the clouds are covering the sky.. much like the cloud of tears that are in my eyes!!       it was nice talking to  krishna  yesterday.. it made things a  bit  clear for me..   camille  : im sorry i didnt get to reply to you yesterday.. it did not pursue because they had an excursion or something.. i think, next next week it will!! heehee!! i was watching your game while trying to get zoology stuff into my not-working-really-well-today brain!! tell me when's your next game, with whom, and where.. i'll try to come..       You can erase someone from your mind. Getting them out of your heart is another story!!    that was the catchy line from the print ad of the  etarnal sunshine of the spotless mind!!

       me and my family ate at gerry's grill in front of abs-cbn for my lolo lory's despidida.. ate a lot because of my depression..      i still cant forget about what happened saturday afternoon.. cant help but cry everytime the topic was brought up by my family members, everytime the thought of it passes by!!! i really feel like dirt!! *exaggerates* i hate it!! my eyes were really puffy and all.. but i still managed to dress up for our dinner..      i spent the night at joanne's house.. though i really find it hard to sleep!! my heart was so heavy.. but this time it was not only because of the reason stated above..      i cant even memorize for my zoology quiz tomorrow.. damn this day!!       my mom called up.. she's been telling me to hurry things up because they gave us a deadline (still about the granted prayer).. and to do good in school!!      hope i can do all the things i want..      miss my friends.. hope i can talk to you soon!!!

"you should be thankful that i didnt go hysterical at barsam hall.. "      we've started with the external anatomy of the frog.. at first i find it disgusting but as time goes by... i got used to it!! my classmates were telling that i was in "full battle gear".. because i was in my lab. gown, face mask, gloves and the lab. goggles that abu gave me a month ago.. we'll have another practical exam for laboratory on thursday (jodette's bday)..       i went to merriam webster to accompany richard to buy school supplies.. i also bought things for myself..      for everybody's information... my birthday is nearing!! (ipangalandakan ba?!) i still dont know if im gonna have a party.. or just treat my friends and family out to dinner.. but one thing's for sure.. ive already have plans on the exact date of my birthday.. i was not the one who arranged it.. it was my cousin, joanne, and my mom!! i promise to make it up to all those whom i love!!      because of all the things about school.. i havent read anything good.. i havent read angels and demons.. and i dont want to start da vinci code unless ive finished with a&amp;d.. so cheska... im really expecting that from you.. you would really make me happy.. kaya nga ni-request ko tlaga yan sayo.. coz i believe that you want to finally see a broad smile on my face!! tsk tsk tsk!! there are a lot of things that i want for my birthday.. haii!!
