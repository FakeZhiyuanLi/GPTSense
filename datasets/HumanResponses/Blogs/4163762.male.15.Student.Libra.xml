       I have had a very tiring day today, last night involved at late night, with alot of DDR and 3 movies. I was pissed when for the first time i failed Orion .78 AMeuro mix on heavy, i think it had somthing to do with the comments that DAN was throwing at me. Then it was his turn to get on by now we had drawn quite a large crowd around of about 8 or 9 (yet there would have been about 15 people counting the ones looking in from the window.      Dans first song was.... i cant remember but he did really good like he always does. I became conicous again when he was on his final song, of course he choose Exotic Ethnic on 1.5 speed and heavy mode, to my suprise he acctually beat the kid he was versing (i didnt mention him before because i dont know his name) but he passed respectivly with an AA, of course i claped followed by a few smart ass comments as i was about to leave i remembered he had his main act still to come and this was his "Extra Stage"      It came with some crazy mods and was Max300 1.5 times speed in reverse (arrows scroll from the top to the bottom) he started of well, and so did the kid next to him, yes it was neck and neck until the kid fumbled it and came back to reality, and saw a pile of random arrows screaming down the page. Dan was still in it for another 43.3 seconds until he decided also to give up and i was happy to leave and wish i was that good.      By now it was about 7.30 pm and freezing, my self and another friend decided to head over the road to the local asian food store and i would releave my Hi Chu, Pocky and Qoo cravings, i ended up buying and erray of crazy products these were:      1 packet hichu   2 bottles of qoo   2 boxes of pockey   1 jar of grass jelly ( i thought i sounded funny)   1 bag of dried chilli ( dan thought he would eat one, and didnt so there just going to rot in my room)   2 bags of sweet and salty snacks   1 pack of my fav instant noodles ( i had for lunch today)   2 cans of instant coffee      we then decided to go back to the mall where we could warm up. i wanted to play more ddr but the line was so long, so i decided to waste it on Initial D and ended up missing the high score table by 3 m.secs god damn, if only i had not crashed in the corner.      By this time we were ready to go home, on the way out we crossed the main road where we nearly got run over by a speeding holden and i called him a f##king moron, to my suprise his holden must have been fitted with some form of super sattlite to pick up my voice because he puuled over to the side of the road, by this time myself, daniel and a quite heavy bag of asain food were racing down the nearest alley, lucky we werent chased, or i would of had to use some of my Kung Fu.      that night we watched sci fi movies which were "shpere" then "the core" and then "horror.com" we fell asleep in front of excel saga at 3.00am,      this is my typical friday night and am looking foward to the next      By Cactus
