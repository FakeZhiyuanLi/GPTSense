      Insomnia nights.  I hate them.  I hate lying there are night, in the dark, trying to fall asleep... wanting to fall asleep. All I can do is lie there with my eyes wide open. God, even when they are shut tightly, they still feel like they are about to spring open.  Torture.  What's worse is that I am being plagued by the hottest and most sexual dreams when I finally do fall asleep, only to wake up shortly afterwards feeling completely unsatisfied.  It's been awhile since I've had wild and naughty sex.  Actually, who am I kidding? It's been awhile since I've had any sex...  The last dream I had was about this beautiful blond stripper I use to visit at a high-class, downtown strip club. Yes, I know... 'high class' and 'strip club' normally never go together - but this one was geared towards those executive types... very clean and very expensive, but top notch women with the most gorgeous bodies.  She had long blond hair and smooth silky legs. Better yet, she had the most beautiful pair of breasts. I wouldn't be surprised if they were 'made up' to some extent but regardless, they were quite the pair... I wanted so much to touch them and nuzzle my nose between that valley.  I was tempted to get a lap dance from her that night since she smiled and winked at me from stage a lot. She even stopped right infront of me just to taunt me with her juicy pussy...  I'm going off on a tangent here...  Point is, I dreamt of her the other night. And she was standing in front of me with a wet, white t-shirt. She took my hand and lead me to her bed where she gently pushed me onto my back.  And then, I felt her slither down my body, rubbing her breasts up against my own as she made her way to that spot that was about to explode.  The last thing I remember was feeling her tongue hit my clit and sending a surge that made me arch my back...  It felt incredibly real which was why waking up at the moment left me to feel incredibly frustrated.   I think I need to go back. But I'll take a date with me. A man. Just so he can watch her give me a lap dance. It's something I've always imagined doing but have never gotten the opportunity...

      I chatted online with you last night. It's been at least a few years since I had any contact with you.   After going offline, I couldn't help but to remember that day after the big bash. I crashed at your place... in another bedroom of course... trying to fall asleep while you had sex with your wife. But all I could hear was the noises of your love-making just a couple of doors down the hall from me.   That night, I masturbated myself to multiple orgasms while listening to you two. It was the only way I could get some sleep.  The next day, she left to do some grocery shopping, leaving the two of us to sleep in and wake up at a leisurely pace.  You were on your sectional couch watching t.v. when I walked in.  I lied there beside you, still trying to decide if I really wanted to wake up. My head turned away from you...  And that's when it happened. I felt your hand reach out and caress my hair. Your palm fit firmly against my scalp and your fingers gently massaged its way through...  You gave me a tingly sensation that both startled me and gave me pleasure. Just as I didn't want that feeling to end, I was relieved when you pulled away.  It wasn't meant to be.

      It's been an obsession of mine as of lately. Not that I'm looking into getting a sex change...  It's just that if I ever find a genie lamp, one of my wishes is to be a handsome stud for one day so not only would I know exactly what it's like to have a penis, but be able to persue beautiful women somewhat more easily then not.  I'd like to know what it's like to enter a woman and feel the sensation in doing so... and I would very much like to know what a male orgasm feels like.

      It's not that I  need  constant flattery.   But every now and then, it's nice to know that I am seen as attractive to certain people.  Men and women.  I'm all for sleeping with either a man or a woman. So long as they are attractive.  Both at the same time is even more closer to equal rights if you ask me.  Yes. I'm all about equality and fairness.

      I dreamt of you again last night... that is now two nights in a row.  I'm beginning to think that you haunt my dreams. And I hate you for that.  In my dream, I was surrounded by others. But I didn't care about them... I didn't care for their chit-chat ways. In fact, I just wanted them to leave for I was awaiting for your arrival.  And then it happened. You.  You finally came into the house and into the room.  We ignored the others as we locked our lips. You ripped off my cloths and pushed me back onto the bed. It was ecstasy. I asked for it and you reciprocated... making me submissive and completely under your control.  Last imagery I had of the dream was running my hands through your curly, dark hair.  And then I woke up.  Please... leave me alone in my dreams.

      You drain me... drain me of all energy and spirit.  I wish this wasn't true. I wish you would just give me the space I need.  Trust. It all comes down to trust.  You feel that I am imcompetant about everything I do... you lack trust that I can make my own decisions...  Please... for the sake of our loved ones and our own relationship. Stop hurting my sanity.  For I fear that I am starting to loathe you.

      I woke up from such a sensual dream... one that didn't actually have any sex scenes. But there was that anticipation for sex. And not just any type of sex, but first time sex with some one I had been chasing for a long time.  Anticipation is always the best part. There is nothing more sweeter then building up to the climax... a long, euphoric build up.  In my dream, I was after this boy my age. And I say boy because I was just a girl in my dream.  He lived in a beautiful house with his beautiful family. The house was large and it's spacious green lawn connected up to a sparlking lake.  We went swimming together... many times. We'd lie under the sun and let it's rays kiss our skin until we were a golden hue. And then, we would dive into the fresh, cold water to rinse ourselves of our sweat.  It then would happen one night. I had to leave and go away for a very long time. And so... I snuck out of my house to visit this boy. I snuck out so I could spend a night with him.  I woke up feeling like I wanted to go back into this dream.  Wouldn't you? How often do we get to dream about first love so pure?

      I'm not always one to fully participate. I needn't take the spotlight for most of the show. In fact, I might be deemd a supporting cast... one to give aid and assistance for the final climax.  And so after taking our turns, I finally got a chance to be the little helper. I got to suck Mr. Terrace-man's cock just to add more natural lubrication... I got to finger fuck Blond Curves until she had an exploding orgasm... and, I got to play with her breasts while he penetrated her continuously... hard and fast.  I love feeling the jiggling of a woman's breasts as they bounce around against my hand. I love watching them as she's being fucked almost to the point where it looks like they are both going out of control.   But the best part are the sounds. To listen to a woman's voice as she moans and as she climaxes. Blond Curves had the best vocals I have ever heard. She was consumed with so much desire and passion everytime she called out.   When I realized Mr Terrace-man was going to keep on fucking her until he came, I positioned myself infront of him so he could watch me use my vibrator.  I fucked myself with it in rhythm with his own thrusting. And he watched me... he watched it go in and out of me, and he watched my facial expression as I prepared myself for my own orgasm. His thrusts became faster. By that point, Blond Curves looked like she was going to lose it. She arched backwards so I oculd see her open mouth and closed eyes.  I pulled the vibrator out of me and focused it on my clit. Rubbing it back and forth, I started to moan myself. At that moment, all one could hear was her and I... moaning as my hips started to make small, circular motions.  As I felt myself coming to my own end, I asked him to fuck her harder. And faster.   That sealed the deal. He grunted with his final thrusts as I arched my back and finally felt the sensation travel from my loins, up my back and into the back base of my head.   The explosion was exquisite.  ...  After we kissed each other on the mouth, we ordered some room service and chatted some more. We laughed and talked about all sorts of things before falling asleep.  The next morning, Mr. Terrace-man arranged for a late check out.  Just so we could have another go...

      A cheesy title for what I'm about to write.  But you see, can you blame me for being in a giddy mood? Can you blame me for feeling so light headed after such a fantastic weekend? For the past two days, I've been rushing around with my head floating high in the clouds.  This Saturday night, Mr. Terrace-man and his lady friend, Blond Curves, met up with me at  a local bar. We chatted over a few drink and some dinner.   It's been awhile... I was excited and nervous at the same time. When was the last time I did a threesome? It's been months. Many, many months. As liberated as I am, I'm damn picky with who I do a threesome with.  She had these big blue eyes that just penetrated me. And her body was even more gorgeous in person! By the end of our meal, she was running her hand up and down my thigh. Blond Curves had easy access to me as I chose, very wisely I might add, to wear my little red, knee high dress.  And she was such a tease. In the car, on the way back to the hotel room Mr. Terrace-man arranged for, she had me leaning back in the back seat. She parted my legs a bit and pushed aside my thong. Her fast finger worked my clit... just enough pressure without over-stimulating me.   I was flying. By the time we arrived at the hotel, she had my juices completely flowing. She wouldn't let me cum, so it was evident that she had me wanting for more...  To be continued...

      Mr. Terrace-Man, the fellow I met at my friend's party last Friday night, emailed me, as he promised, a photo of his lady friend.  And what caught my attention the most was her curves.  I'm not exactly sure why I get so excited when I see such smooth curves on a woman. Perhaps because my own built is on the straight, boyish side. I'm tall, but my own hips are somewhat small. I have a long torsel, and cup B size breasts.  And perhaps I'm just attracted to women who are somewhat opposite from me... I want to explore those curves that I don't possess. I want to touch such well-endowed breasts... feel them as they jiggle and bounce while she's being fucked hard by another.  That's another thing I'm looking forward to. My fascination with watching... I love to participate but in the end, I'd rather sit back and just watch... and help... and hopefully get a chance to try out my new vibrator.  Oh yeah... and she's blond. As much as she happens to have a thing for asian women, I happen to have a thing for blond women.

      After being single for over a year, I found myself staying far away from dating. I wasn't even interested in sex. The ending of my relationship with J was so bitter, it left a bad taste in my mouth for months. 11 months, to be exact... 11 months where I kept myself schedule filled with activities and outings.  Either with others or all on my own.  And then that urge started to arise. That hunger.   I wanted to be touched again. I wanted to be put into different, submissive positions. I wanted to be fucked... hard.  As usual, opportunities seems the represent themselves when I finally give up on looking.  This particular opportunity happened this past Friday night at a friend's party.  He tagged along with a friend of the hostess. And, I have to admit, he looked completely bored.  I found him outside on the terrace on the second level which was attached to the master bedroom suite. He sipped his wine, not from a wine glass, but from those little glasses. Like how people sip their red wine from Italy.   I went up there just to get some air... there must have been a hundred people at this party. And as big as my girlfriend's house was, the place seemed packed... and hot. Very hot.  It wasn't like I expected to see anyone else there. As I stepped out... he was simply just... there.  I smiled at him. He smiled back. We exchanged some extremely short pleasantries as I ran my eyes quickly up and down his body, ending up studying his face the most.  Not too long after, I knew I wanted to have him. So I downed my wine, walked up to him and asked him if he wanted to go lock the doors to the bedroom.   The next hour was spent in each other's arms. I knew only his first name but that's all I needed to call out softly as I first climaxed... he had taken his and hand slid it down between my thighs where he decided to finger-fuck me until my release. I haven't been finger fucked like that for so long. I arched my back and felt the delicious, juicy explosion.  We ended up finishing with him behind me.   It was exquisite.   At the end, he gave me his number. I'm to call him before this weekend so we can meet up again.  He has a friend. A female friend. And so I told him to email me a photo of her... if I like what I see, we'll meet again.  The three of us.

      What is it about certain women and me? Why do I trust them only to find out that they were merely just malnipulative my emotions?   How does one deal with the truth that a friend... a 'sista'... has been two-faced?  After all this time, how do I deal with the fact that she was never who she claimed to be?  It comes down to the truth about me as well. I hate it when I am put to the test. I fear failure. For I truely want to walk away... composed and indifferent.  But that side of me, the part that is more human that I'm willing to admit, hurts and silently screams inside. And then I feel it...   Revenge. Justice. I want them both.  And then... I retract back into the shadows. Too afraid to truely try anything.  Much too afraid to witness my own true colours.

      It's raining outside... and the rain feels like it's sweeped its way in.  What day is it today? Wednesday? No wonder... it's hump day. For me, that signifies the worst day of the week. I will take any crummy Monday over hump day Wednesday. Any.  I felt a bit under the weather this morning. Seeing as how I have a lot of sick days left, I decided to call in sick.  Turns out the tickle in my throat was cured after rehydrating myself.  How foolish am I?  Well, not foolish at all. As it's grey outside, I decided to turn on my computer, watch a porn mpeg of two lovely ladies share a double-ended dildo, and completed my orgasm while this gorgeous french woman lies on the floor, waiting for one of several men to take their turn on her.  God... what a wonderful orgasm it was, though I was hoping to prolong it until I could see one of my footages of a woman and a fuck-machine.   I love those fuck machines. I wish I had enough money to buy one for my very own use...  But... I digress... as usual.  Okay... I'm not quite done yet. I need to have a few more goes.   I promise my next blog won't be so sexually. It's just lately, I've been needing a release real bad...

      I'm going to T-Bay tomorrow for a big family shin-dig. I so do not want to go. I'm sure I'll find a way to have fun once I'm there, but I dread talking to some of the people whom I'll be forced to socialize with.  They don't seem like happy people. They complain. A lot. About everyone. Behind other people's back. It will be gossip city.  And I'm not a big fan of gossip.   I've only been to T-Bay a couple of times in my life (mostly for weddings), but let me just say that I can't even meet a decent, available guy there. Probably because whenever I go, I'm chained to the family.  Oh dear God... make this trip go fast.

      I had a dream last night that I had spent the weekend with  urlLink tassy  and  urlLink jimbo . Neither of them I have ever met.  I dreamt that we went out to the country side during the day and then partied in town the same evening. I was anticipating something more to happen as night approached. Too bad I woke up before the ending of the dream.  I suppose that's what allures me to stalk these lovely, online creatures. The mystery is sexy. It keeps things feeling delicious.

      Awhile ago, I was watching a special documentary of some popular red light district in Japan.   They featured a special bar called 'The Blow Job Bar'. Or something like that... I'm not exactly sure what the rough translation is from Japanese to English, but it's not the title of the bar that's of any importance. It's what happens inside that matters.  A customer can walk in and pay in 15 minute increments as he sits in a private room, getting blow jobs by the girls that work there. Every 15 minutes, he gets a new girl    The documentary was probably the hottest documentary I have ever seen. Move over Farenheit 9/11... it's all about blow job bars now.   I imagined how exciting it would be to visit one of these bars. Only... I wonder if female customers would get the same kind of treatment. Would I get a chance to get my pussy licked by different women?   Better yet, could I convince them to use different toys on me, and then get them off with a toy or two as well?   Every 15 minutes, the bell would ring... a new woman... a new toy.

      I'm excited. I'm exhilerated. I am totally fucking ecstatic!    No plans can be made with me this weekend. Sorry... no clubbing nor bar hopping. No movies... not even the Calgary Stampede (which I did get the chance to see with the help of my client and some extra, free tickets just a couple of days ago - I have a think for cowboys).     I have a date. I very important date. One that excites me because it's just one of those dates that's making my heart flutter. I even catch myself with what can only be described as a goofy grin whenever I think about this weekend.    The cynnical side of me wants to say, "Calm the hell down, girl... you've been burned before so try to play it cool for once, okay? Don't embarrass me. Sheesh." But... it's been awhile since I've been this nervous AND excited about a date.    He's funny. He's intelligent. He's just abso-fucking-lutely beautiful! We've been casually flirting with each other for the past couple of months. After spending some time emaling and chatting with him online, he started to call me. And our conversations progrssed from there.     I finally built up the courage to ask him out...    So... this Friday's the big date.     What should I wear? I've always been partial to black, slinky dresses.     A black thong will go well with the dress.

      It's not like I love watching the show... sure, I'll be the first to admit that if there's nothing else one, I'll watch it. I'm not against it in any way...  But unlike most people, I'm just not a huge Friend's fan.  So why, pray tell, was I a victim of having a sexual dream with the characters from said sitcom?  I dreamt that I got it on with Rachel while Joey and Chandler watched. And then she left us so I could have a private threesome with the boys... first with Chandler, then with Joey.  And then a DP to end the whole 'scene by the hot tub' fun.  I can't believe I had such a dream.  How embarrassing.

      I'm back and I'm exhausted.   As mentioned before, I wasn't all too pleased to be going on this little family reunion. Lets just say that the trip was anything but relaxing nor bearable.  However, I did have a very sweet and short run-in with a gorgeous brunette on the plane departing Calgary. She seemed like she was around my age. Sitting across the aisle from me at her window seat, I only first caught site of her side-profile. As well as this interesting tatoo which looked like native american art.  After the plane had landed, she got up and turned to me.  I was completely swepted away by her beauty. She had these gorgeous, native american eyes. Her lips were thick and lucious. Her skin smooth and only slightly tanned. And her hair was just this gorgeous flow of black silk.  She smiled at me. And I instantly fantasized what it would be like to have her go down on me. Honestly, I've never wanted to badly to make another woman cum right on the spot like that. Usually, I'd need to chat with another woman before I could gauge whether or not I'd be interested in her physically. This time around, it seemed almost too intense.   I still wonder what she would sound like while having an orgasm.   No such luck though in making it happen. She was with her one year old. I smiled at her and told her she had an adorable kid.  I'm starting to think I'll never join the mile high club.
