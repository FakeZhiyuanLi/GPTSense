      I know I've been far from you recently, but I was just trying to find the truth out. I didn't succeed. My blog isn't going anywhere but I've realised that I do need you. May every word I ever speak to you be true and from my heart. I want to love you like other do. I feel nothing for you Lord, but I really need you to be there. I am a nasty kid I know. I wish I could love you. I wish I could. Please help me.

      My darling.  I don't deserve to be with you. I have many problems and am dark in my core. I've been looking at pictures of girls violating their beauty and I enjoyed it. Every picture I've ever looked at has violated our sacred marriage covenant. Every time I've looked lustfully at some woman, I've commited adultery with her in my heart. Every time I've done it, I've compromised our marriage and disrespected you.   So I pledge to you before God, that from tonight I will make every effort not do do this again, not to violate you and other girls and not to sin against God.  I don't know how I will do this but I pray that God gives me strength and guidance.    I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

      I spent the evening looking at porn.    I hate this state of affairs.

      I would go off the rails. I know I would. I would hire prostitutes to try and satisfy my lust issues. I would get involved with any old girl who came along. I would do anything that felt good. I would get depressed. If there is no God, there is no point to your life. I need to have a point to my life. I have this vague memory of a darkness with no future. That was the time before I was a Christian. I do need God. I need him all the time. Even if he doesn't speak to me ever, the assurance that he is interested in my life and is using me is enough. Really. Each day has a point and is a piece in the grand puzzle if God exists. If he doesn't, each day is just another day. You eat, you sleep. Maybe you have pleasure maybe you have pain. But your existence is of no importance and you are a nothing. That really sucks.     OK, so I cannot live without a purpose. I don't know why I need it so much. I can't live without God.

      I believe in God because I want to and think it isn't irrational to do so. There. That's probably as good as it's ever going to get. I also believe in him because he seems to talk to me. Mybe it's my inner psyche, or maybe it's aliens or maybe it's my over active imagination. It's like that Matrix conundrum all over again. It doesn't matter. I can never know for sure so I'll chose to believe the most rational explanation.    OK, screw that. I want to believe in God. I can sort of. I cant run my life without the assumption that God is actually leading me. I can't live without believing that there is some purpose to what I'm doing.

      Then I could make a radical life changing commitment to God and be sincere about it. Alas my history has screwed me. I was never ANTI god, and then I became a proper Christian, because it was the right thing to do. As a result I'm now not really FOR god either. My brain has been stuffed with a lot of rhetoric that I'm battling to escape now.  I wish I could start again. Starting again isn't easy.    It's hard to live without the comfort of believing in God, that I can say. I'm trying to be honest and straightforward and only think and talk about what I know for sure. As such I'm trying to put God on hold in my life. I'm sure he doesn't mind, because he knows my ultimate objective is the truth.

      I don't feel like I am. I'm now sitting here waiting for a miracle. This is stupid. Anyway if a miracle does happen, will I be without doubt that it was God? Maybe.    AHHH! My dumb ADD ridden brain is letting me down again. It's frustrating not to be able to think clearly.

      Um nothing unusual happened, I think. Perhaps I'm not paying attention. Hold on. I did ask God to help me get through a day when I was too tired to even think straight, and I got through it OK. Not sure what that means though...

      I'm on the alert for something strange or unusual, which could be God.

      OK, I need to take some steps to achieving my goal of ultimate happiness. I need to go for my best option at his point which is direct communication with God. I will speak to God if he exists and ask for either an unnatural manipulation of the ordinary, or some kind of response to my attempts to communicate with him. I'll give it a few days. Hmmm - How long should I go though... I'll try wait for a week.

      I need to find God. He needs to be willing to communicate with me and give me an answer to my question. How can I find God? I need to search for evidence of God. I need to find out how I can communicate with God. This needs to be reasonable, though. So where can I find out about a being who has knowledge of everything? I cannot perceive such a being as far as I know. So my senses are no good here unless God chooses to speak to me through an unnatural or unusual manipulation of my ordinary experience. So unless something rather strange and out of the ordinary happens, I will have to ask others or God directly. I have to assume though, that God would be willing to listen and would be willing to respond to my candid attempt at interaction. If I do not hear from God, I am left having to rely on others. This is not ideal, as they may be misinformed. Again though, there is little to lose so this seems OK.

      There is nothing to be lost in searching for God. If I find nothing, I will have had some varied experiences and undoubtedly grown more aware of what does and doesn't make me happy. This partly fulfills my goal of ultimate happiness anyway.

      So I want to be happy, but I don't know how to be. There is no way of knowing with confidence except if God were to tell me. Time is short and this does seem to be the best option. I find myself hoping that God does exist... Hmmm. God is possible and I want him to exist so I can achieve my ultimate goal of being happy in life. Well, does a God exist? Even if so, God would need to be willing to listen to me and communicate with me. Can I know whether this is the case? No again. Uncertainty. Nevertheless, my quest is important enough to continue even if there is uncertainty.

      OK, where was I... Right. If it is unreasonable to think that 'not me' is confined to my observations of it, then it becomes reasonable at least to believe that there are parts of 'not me' that I am unable to perceive directly. God could be here, but I don't find any good reason for assuming that he/she/it is actually. However there remains a logical possibility that God could exist. In fact a whole number of things could exist and God could be one of them

      It's in my heart. If I let it go I could be a sick... I don't think I'm special in this regard. When I get sexually aroused, I flip into animal mode and stop thinking rationally. It FREAKS me out. This should not be. I've been there. Porn is a bad business. It's addictive and like any addiction you need more and more of the stuff to get the same high. Then it gets boring and you need to move onto harder stuff. So begins the descent until you plumb the depths of sickness of the soul. I know how it works. I haven't gone all the way, thank goodness, but I could easily. Porn is a problem. I either need to change myself to not get turned on by it (impossible I guess) or just not view it... I don't feel good about myself right now. It is mental abuse of women.

      My senses tell me about 'not me'. According to them, if I cannot see, hear, smell, taste or touch it, it doesn't exist. However that is not true in experience. There are countless things, that have been discovered by man that are not directly observable. Microwaves are a good example. They cannot be perceived by our senses, but the effects of concentrated microwave radiation are very obvious (think of hot microwaved food). So it's not reasonable from experience to believe that 'not me' is dependent upon my observation of it. In fact, 'not me' seems to be unaffected by my observations of it at all. This leads me to believe that 'not me' is much larger than my sense tell me.

      What is the nature of 'not me'. I can't know anything about 'not me' except from my senses. My senses tell me that 'not me' is very big, much bigger than 'me'. I also know that I can change 'not me'. I can manipulate it to suit me at times, and at times, I can't do anything about it's state at all. Not me contains what appear to be other 'me's. They seem to be similar to me in many ways. I seem to feel, sense and perceive things in a very similar way to many of these other 'me's. I know this from my experience interacting with them (The fact that we can communicate at all requires a lot of commonality between us). These other 'me's seem to have quite a lot to do with my happiness. They have the ability to make me very happy and very sad, more than most other 'not me' stuff. I'll file this in the back of my mind...

      I wanted to avoid this for some reason, but I guess you can't escape God when doing philosophy. I need to know what will bring me maximum happiness, but trial and error isn't great and other people's suggestions might or might not work. This is not particularly satisfying. The other option is to ask someone who would know, and that person would be God. Well, does God exist, because if he does, I want to ask him what can make me happy. The notion of God is tied into my understanding of 'not me'. Here we go again, I hope this doesn't get circular...

      So my goal is maximum happiness. How do I achieve that? Well, that's a good question asked by almost every soul since the beginning of time, I would imagine. This I don't know. This is a question about 'me' which I am unable to answer at the moment. However my goal must be to answer this question. How can I do this? How can I know what will bring me ultimate happiness? Well I can partly know the answer to this question from experience, but that is not enough as it is a hit and miss thing that I might not hit. I could ask other people, but that assumes that they are the same as me and will find happiness in the same things I will. This doesn't seem to be a reasonable assumption at this point in time. OK, so this is the moment when I bring God into the picture...

      I know I exist. I'm not sure what else does but I chose to believe that there is 'not me' that exists separately from me. I know that the physical me is controlled by the non physical me. I know that without eternal existence, there is ultimately no point to anything I do (I'm not quite sure about this though), Although I find this hard to explain. Now I need to know what is valuable or important, so I can focus my efforts on that. I think the answer is my well being. That is what I want. That is the most important thing. As explained above, I have nothing else to go on really. So what is in my best interests? Well I want to be happy, I don't know why, or if I can even ask such a fundamental question logically, but I know I have desires and I want them met. That's the end of that.

      My continued existence is not the top priority. The notion of hell is an eternal existnace that isn't pleasant at all. If faced  with hell, I would rather not exist. So continued existence is not the top priority. What is then? Continued existence is surely important. To cease to exist renders all previous existence completely meaningless. If one does not exist then one cannot enjoy or benefit from anything, even the thought of anything one has previously done when one did exist.  Sidetrack: It seems eternal existence is a precondition for meaning in life...

      What is important?   me of course.  me is the only thing I can know for certain and it is only because of the existence of me that I am aware of both me and non me [my logic is a bit shaky admittedly, because I keep referring to 'I' as something separate to 'me' which of course it isn't. It's just not possible to imagine anything without there existing a 'me'.] Reality is the perception of 'non me' and 'me' by 'me'. My continued existence is the most important thing. Anything I do that has no influence on 'me', is a waste of my time. Even noble notions of selflessness have a me focus. They all reward 'me' in eternal life or present life with something. Even selfless unconditional love has a me focus: The giving of love in a selfless way brings an immense amount of joy, and hence benefit, to the giver. I sincerely believe this. There is nothing truly selfless, for anything completely selfless is an utter waste of time.

      So, what is me? Me seems to be made up of a few things: 'physical me' - I can sense the presence of 'phsical me' by distinguishing it from 'not me' and by my ability to directly manipulate 'me'. 'physical me' is controlled by me - another me. 'non physical me' - this other me can control the movement of 'physical me'. Whether these two are seperate at all is a matter of debate, and not one that I think I'll be able to solve [In this whole rethinking process, I'm not going to be able to escape many of my past presuppositions about reality.]. Regardless, there are at least distinct parts of me, two of which I've mentioned above. In my experience, physical me is an extremely advanced vehicle that allows the non physical me to move, and manipulate the 'not me'. The physical me is however, much more closely linked with the non physical me than a driver is linked with his vehicle. Every tiny movement that the non physical (np) me desires is carried out instantaneously by the physical (p) me. Converesely, every sensation recieved by the np me is instantly given to the p me. The condition of the one directly affects the condition of the other. I believe (irrationally) that the link between the two is very complex.

      So, there exists a 'me' and I chose to believe in the existence of a 'not me'.

<post>

	 
      Is the 'me' and 'not me' real or just a perception? Well, the 'me' must be real, because without a real me to percieve, the perception of me wouldn't exist. I assume that a perception can't percieve itsself. As for the 'not me', I can't be sure of that. It is possible that the 'me' might percieve what isn't there and make me belive that there is a 'not me'. Regardless, I choose to treat the 'not me' as if it were real, because I have no way of verifying it's realness except by external observation of the 'me' which is logically impossible. (My perception of 'me' and 'not me' is intrinsically linked with 'me', which I can never escape.)

      Other things exist, too. In my experience, I am seperate from things which are not me, which means that reality consists of me and not me. There seems to be a lot more 'not me' than 'me' which makes me think that I am something relatively small.

      If I am here, I must exist. What 'exist' means is a whole nuther argument, but I can be absolutely sure that in some sense, there is a thing called me, because I am asking a question.

      Everything I thought I knew about myself, the universe, life and God, I shall hence ignore. I want to know the truth about life and the _rhetoric_ I've been fed for so long isn't cutting it.

      Just saw this amazing movie  It's 3:00 am and I shouldn't be here. It's just that I feel so alive, my brain is so awake. I feel like a frustrated creative type - I've got spans of pent-up mental energy and I don't know what to do with it. I feel like I could solve the worlds problems right here, right now, but I know from past experience that my thinking isn't great at this time of the night. It's very frustrating. There's something in me just bursting to get out, but it never comes out.  I guess I'll just have to go to bed. How mundane and anticlimactic. The real world is so boring sometimes.  bye.

      This ADHD thing is getting me down, and screwing me around. Things are starting to fall apart at the seams. I'm worried. I just can't seem to do what I should do. Maybe I'm just weak willed. Maybe I need God's help. Maybe I just don't know. Well in the mean time it's time for excercise to counteract the effects of my medication...  Wish me luck.
