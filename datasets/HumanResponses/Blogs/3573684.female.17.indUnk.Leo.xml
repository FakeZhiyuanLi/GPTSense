                       I dyed my hair purple today, but my hair is to dark and it didn't take. Im pissed. But, whatever. I redyed it burgundy instead. Im waiting now to wash it out, it smells bad. I hate that nasty smell. It makes me feel very light headed and dizzy. I cant breathe to well right now. Anyways. I dont want to go to Colorado. I'll miss Brian too much!! So sad. Again, its so cold in here, my fingers are like ice. Im running out of things to say. Ahhh! I never have nothing to say unless Im angry or sad. And right now Im neither. Im just content. Brian and I have to mow the yard tomorrow. Exciting isn't it? I know, Im boring myself to tears. I wonder if hair color is flammable..hehe. Do you think Wendys will take Canadian money? Cause its all I got. I cleaned out the fridge and pantry..and theres no food. Oh wait! Theres spghettios in there. Hmm, maybe I should eat that. Although I think if I do they might make me sick. Like one or 2 bites is good, but 3 or 4 is nauseating. So now Im back to square one, nothing. Oh and we have no bread, so a tuna fish sandwhich is out. Which was my next thing I felt like. Oh hell, its time to shower and rinse! After, possibly find food.

                    Last night one of the best things happen, oh by the way, listening to Marilyn Manson (Antichirst Superstar)so that helps the mood. Brian finally ended his friendship with Tashia, she is finally out of our lives! See if you don't know the whole story then you won't get it, but wrapped up in a nutshell she tried to take Brian away from me and she was in his band as well, but now she's not and he ended their friendship so now we will never have to asociate with her again! Yay! Life is good! Anyways. Im going to dye my hair purple today! Im excited, I just hope that it looks good. I don't want it to come out crappy. This Saturday Im leaving for Colorado for a week. Ahhh, Im going to miss Brian so much!!! Im going to cry, I don't want to leave. I've never been a week away from him. The most was like 2 days, and that was torture. I don't know what I'll do *sadness* Holy Shit is it cold in here. Im freezing. I keep putting off doing the dishes. I guess I must do them...they call to me.

                       Today Brian and I found a pug that was lost from home! He was so cute! His name was Scooby-Do! He was such a cutie! Not cuter than my Brian though!! We wanted to keep him. When we get older and married we want a pug. I want 2, a boy and a girl, and name the boy Puk, and the girl Daisy! But Brian doesn't know if he wants 2 dogs cause they stink, which I agree, but I think itd be so cute to have 2 little doggies that are married like me and Brian! Thatd be so precious! I didnt want to return the cute little poochie! Ill write more later.

                Today Brian and I printed out his flyers and went and posted them at House of Guitars, Music Town, and Bizarre Bizarr. Tomorrow we're going to post more at Guitar Center, H&H Music, DiamondHead, and Liquids. Im excited about it! I just hope that he get's some responses soon. He's working hard on his guitar and is trying to make up some songs. So far I think he has a good start. I mean give him credit, he's doing this solo. The only person he has, is me, and Im not in the band Im just helping him with anything that I can. I love Brian so much. I hope that everything works out the way he wants it too. Its exciting! We also decided to go on a picnic! Although when we were at the grocery store today we didn't get anything for it. damnit! God I should really go to bed. I mean last night I went to bed at 5:30 am and didn't get up until 3pm. I mean shit...but oh well.

                       Today my mommy left for Canada. I went to bed around 4am and got back at 8 am so I could take her to the airport. I came back home around 11 am and I went to bed. Brian called at 2 but I was still tired so he let me go back to sleep. He woke me up again at 3 and we decided to see each other, however I fell back asleep when I got off the phone and didn't get up until 4. I got ready, and saw my Baby! We went to Diamondhead Records and Brian bought a really awesome Cradle of Filth video. The video itself isn't cool, but the case of it is! hehe! He also bought an import from Japan Iron Maiden cd. Which is awesome, I love Iron Maiden, its the original one too, made in 1985, not remastered either. Then we went to Kroger and home. We decided to go to a movie, "The Chronicles of Riddick." The movie was at 9:20pm. It was a good movie. I liked it, once I understood it completly. I wasn't paying attention to the beginning of it I was thinking of other things. hehe! oppsie. Sabrina hadn't called in awhile and I had been wondering why, well today I found out why! She had left her cell phone in my car and I didn't know it. So after the movie she had gotten a hold of me and we went to her house and brought her cell phone to her. I need Help! I need ideas of things to do. There just isn't much to do. Brian and I have rented almost every movie there is. Eating out doesn't really consist of doing something fun. The mall is extremely boring. No good movies out. Brian doesn't really like to hang out with our friends so thats out. I want to learn how to sew but I know it would bore Brian to tears. Brian needs to put his band together. I think itd atleast give us something to do. I think itd be fun to help him. Maybe Ill talk to him about it. I wish I was artistic. I guess once we get a job we'll have less time on our hands. Speaking of which, we're turning in our job applications tomorrow. hmmm. I need to buy a camera, I want pictures of my Baby and me! I keep forgetting all the stuff that I want to do, I need to start writing these things down. Maybe then Id remember and Id actually get some things done.

                    Today Brian came over, we were going to go swimming but decided not to, instead we took a 2 hour nap! So we slept and that was nice, we had to mow the yard so we did that. By the time we were done it was 8:30pm so we didn't go to Walmart or swimming today like planned. Oh well. Tomorrow we were going to go to the Zoo but I don't know how to get there, and my mom is leaving tomorrow morning for Canada. I don't want her to leave. That's going to suck. Brian and I have been discussing him moving. It's really starting to get to us. We both want him to move in as soon as possible. It's nerve racking, I don't like not knowing what's going to happen. It scares me. I don't want to lose the best thing that I have in this world. I hope that he moves in. God I just want things to go right. We really have things planned out for us. We our planning on getting jobs at the same place, we both want to move in together, go to school, and start saving for our lives together. Then after high school go to college and I mean we just have things worked out so perfectly. I don't want him to go. I would do anything for him to stay.

                   I just talked to Brian about going to the Houston Zoo and he wants to go! Yay! Something fun to do for once! And we get to feed bats! Thats exciting! I mean we look like them, wish we were Vampires, what more could we ask for than to feed our lovely bloodsucking friends?! hehe. Im so excited! I think it'll be fun. And theres a carrousel! I like carrousels, I've never ridden the one in the Woodlands mall and everytime I go I want to ride it, but never do. *sad lip* Happy days to come! Even more fun tomorrow! We are going to go swimming in our kiddie pool!! Yay!! We haven't been able to swim for the rain and my period, but now Im off so Yay! Finally fun things to do! Oh and we get to go to Walmart tomorrow! Im going to get some new make-up and a camera and me and my baby are going to take tons of pictures together! Although he wants naked pictures, but hes not getting that! Not until we have moved out of my house and are living together. Oh also, we went to Subway today and our friend Jessica was working and she said that they are hiring, and we're looking for a job for both of us, at the same place and close by, which it is! And we know her, so thats a plus! I hope that we get it. We're turning in our applications on Wednsday. I hope that we get it, and that we can start when school starts! That would be cool! Things are starting to get better! So Happy! Although its 3am and Im awake with nothing to do but write in this, its all good. Although I am talking to the Love of my Life, so thats the Best thing in the World! We started talking about our wedding today. Under the stars, by the ocean, at night, with tons of candles, a beautiful little orchestra like band, flowers, the ocean breeze...oh the Most wonderfully magical moment of my Entire Life will be that day. That day the earth will stop and be focused on my new Hubby and his new Wife! Ahh, the future to come!

                         I was really harsh yesterday. I let my emotions and depression run my thoughts and feelings. Im so sorry to Brian. I shouldn't have been so bitchy. I apoligize greatly and shouldn't have been so dumb. Brian got back at 1:15 am and called me and he spent the night! He bought me a beautiful ring which I love to death! Now I feel like a complete jackass and a bitch and don't deserve this ring or for him to speak to me. Im suprised he was so understanding, well actually, hes always understanding of me, so Im not suprised,but I am Grateful!!! Thanks Baby, youre the Best!

              So here I am stuck at home. Brian still hasnt come home Im guessing since I haven't heard from him. Joy. I didn't call Sabrina to do anything, I wasted my night. Go me. I put on some exotic looking make-up, it kind of looked mod style. It would be pretty cool with the right outfit that I don't have and with cute boots that micheal has, and I don't, but maybe some day! I have the right hat for it...if that counts. 11:36 pm and nothing to do. No call from my boyfriend...no movie to watch..no one online to talk to..no music to listen to..absolute zero shit and that's what I am. Why can't today be over? I guess Ill listen to Nightwish. I hate today more than anything. It's been completly gutwrenching. I really get depressed without Brian. I wish I could go to sleep so this stupid day would end, but I cant sleep. I wont go to bed until 4am again and my grandmother is coming to town tomorrow, so I will have to get up early and do some quick touches to the house. I wonder if Brian asked Robert to go to Astroworld with him and is staying at his house tonight. Wouldnt be suprised. And won't have the common decency to call me to tell me that he's okay. But I guess when your out having fun, and your girlfriend is home alone depressed not much matters...right? I tend to think the worst of everything. I am going insane. I can't stand being in this house anymore, and I hate not knowing if Brian is okay or not. I'm sure he is, but things happen. I would love to just stab myself right now. Itd feel good to just bleed until I pass out, then I could sleep and not feel these dreadful feelings. I even have a pain in my chest from it. Slowly dying.

                    Im extremly pissed off. First off, I didn't go to bed until 4 something this morning and my mom wakes me up at 11 to go with her to the hospital to drop some files off. So I go with her, then I come home and Brian calls and tells me they're going to Astroworld and can I go. I asked my dad and ofcourse because I have cleaning to do I couldn't go. So Brian went without me and I got stuck home cleaning. Then, around 2:45 my mom comes home, I tell her what happened and she talks to my dad and then he said I could go. Well, I new Brian had left already, but I called anyway, they left. So I got stuck here cleaning when I could have gone and had fun for once. Im so mad. First Im mad at my dad, I mean thats a given. But then I'm kind of mad at Brian. I mean I know I shouldn't be, but I am. I feel like he just left me. I know that if my family invited me and Brian couldn't come, I'd stay. Hell Im still trying to get out of going to Colorado (which I love and want to move there one day) just so I can be with him. I know I shouldn't be mad, but I just can't help but feel that I was left. We never get to do anything fun and then the one thing and my dad says no, but then changes his mind After they left. And if my dad wouldn't have made me go with my mom then I probably would have been done cleaning and could have gone. I don't know if Im going to see Brian today. Thats another thing that makes me mad is this is our Saturday, we only get 2 days of the week to stay out until midnight and now he wasted our entire day and probably won't get back until 10 tonight knowing them. God Im just so mad. I hate everyone and everything. Then I went to Sally's Beauty Supply to see if they had the hair dye I want (purple) but my mom said that it wouldn't take on my hair so I didn't get it and I have to wait to find some better stuff. Nothing can ever just go right. Something or SOMEONE always fucks things up for me. Nothing is ever good enough. I swear. I take care of 2 disable parents, practically do everything..clean the house all the time, get them food, get their medicine, run all over the place getting shit for them, fix them food, bring them drinks, take out the trash, do their laundry...I mean all I want is to sometimes go out even if I have cleaning and do it later. I Always do what they ask me to when they ask me to. I stay up late and they wake me up early, but I get up for them. I mean basically I bow down to them and answer their beckon call. I just want a little bit of sleep and a little bit of fun. Im only 16 and I need a break. But, that doesn't matter. Im just feeling sorry for myself. But, atleast Im writing it down and getting it out so I dont complain to Brian or my friends about it. That way I can complain to people that I dont know and dont care about if they think Im selfish and spoiled and ungrateful (my dad). This is pathetic its Saturday and its almost 7:30pm and Im doing nothing. I should call Sabrina..but I know if I do Brian probably won't be Happy, although why should I care, he couldn't wait on me, so why should I wait on him to get back? Why should I waste my whole day why he's having fun. Fuck that. Maybe Ill call Sabrina, I don't know. Later Maggots.

          Hey. Tonight Brian and I went to Java Jazz (the local coffehouse where bands play on the week-ends) We went to see Impathy, the local high school band at our school. Brian audtioned to be their lead singer, and he made it, but he decided that he'd rather be guitarist more than anything so he quit. So their really good and we went to see them tonight. It was fun kind of. Mainly I had fun after the show just sitting and chilling with Brian, Sabrina and Robert. I like Impathy a lot and Im glad they have a big crowd, but god its so hot with all those damn people! Im at a loss for words. I hope Brian moves in soon. Id love living with him. Itd be so fun! I just think that for once things would go my way if he were to move in. I don't want him to move away. That happened with Andy, and Im glad now that it did, but I cant go through it again. I cant go through that pain and heartache. I know I'd go through a lot more with Brian than I did Andy because I'm in love with Brian and we connect like no one I've ever met. He's my Best Friend and Lover, I can't lose him. If he moves I know we'll break up, not because I want to, but he's already said that. I understand why, it'd be to difficult, but I couldn't get over him and I wouldn't want him with anyone else. It'd break me if he was with someone else. I don't know what I would do. The day he moves in, a big sigh of relief will be put out. To know that he will be here Forever, that's a comforting thought. Well Im going to go.I love Brian! Later Maggots.

                 Hey, I never did get to explain about myself so I figured I'd do it now. Im almost 17, I will be in August, and Im a Senior now. I dont look forward to getting my liscense renewed. I guess you could say that my boyfriend Brian and I are goth if your into the whole labeling thing. I love my Brian! We've been together now for 7 months, I know that doesn't seem like a real long time and that Im only 16 and I don't know shit about anything, but I do know that I love him. My first serious relationship lasted 2 years and 7 months with a duchebag named Andy. He broke me, even though I left him for Brian...he still broke my heart during our relationship. That's why I'm glad to say that I love my Brian and he's nothing like that faggot. Yes I was engaged to him, but come on he asked when I was 14..any girl would be flattered into saying yes. However, since Ive had a little expierence in that department, I know not to just say yes to anyone. Brian isn't just Anyone. He's everything that I've ever wanted. Sure he has flaws as if any human, but they're flaws that I love about him and wouldn't ask him to change in a million years. Okay, so you all think I'm crazy, (which I am) but if you ever have fallen in love you know what I mean. Well, lets see what else is there to tell, now that you know some of my personal relationship buisness. I love death metal, black metal, and nu metal. My favorite band is Slipknot. However,their new album is rather depressing. It sounds more like Stone Sour. But some other bands I like are(in no particular order) Iron Maiden, Cannibal Corpse, Marilyn Manson, Killswitch Engage, Chimaira, Cradle of Filth, Dimmu Borgir, Mortician, Dark Tranquilty, Dream Theater, Journey and a lot more that I cant think of. Some of my favorite movies are Donnie Darko, Nightmare on Elm Street (1st one), Dawn of the Dead (the original), Walking Tall, and I really liked The Day After Tomorrow. I used to work at Chick-fil-a and it sucked. Now I have to find another job soon because Im going to be in CO. OP. which sucks. I dont want to do it. It takes up so much time. Although I'll have more money..and I can start saving to move out. Although I probably wont move out until Im 23 but whatever. It's to hard to make it on your own without money, which means go to college, have a part time crap job, and save as much as you can while sponging off your parents and living with your boyfriend in a small bedroom at home..yeah thats my life for the next 7 years. Im looking forward to it..and your looking forward to reading about it. Lucky you! Oh yes, if you think I do drugs your nuts. I've smoked weed only twice, and I was 15. I didn't like it and have never done it again. I despise drugs. That's why I lost my best friend because she turned to drugs to solve her problems instead of me. I don't drink, I don't like alcohol either really. Just some for the taste, but not to get drunk..alcoholism runs in my family, and I don't want to get addicted. No way to spend your life or your money. I used to smoke, since like 6th grade off and on. Currently I quit and hope to stay that way. It's so bad for your lungs, I know its addicting believe me,even though I know how bad it is, I still crave one every now and then. Mainly whenever I'm around my friends that smoke. I'm more of a social smoker. Kind of like those that are social drinkers..except you can't get drunk off of a cig. Well, I have to shower now because I'm going to see the Love of my Life in a few! I love Brian so Much!! Later Maggots!

                 Happy Anniversary Brian! Today is Brian and I's 7 month Anniversary! Im so lucky to be with him! He makes me the Happiest person in the World. I want to marry him some day. Hopefully sometime soon. I hope to at 19-20. I know its young, but I cant stand waiting so long. Atleast we will be living together before that so it wont be as bad. I love him so much. He makes me feel so alive. I just wish that he new how I felt. I just wish that he could move in already. I know things would be perfect. I think that Id feel so much more closer to him. Well, I know this is short but Im tired. I love you Brian with all my Heart!!

         You cant trust anyone anymore. I hate everyone in this stupid world. Just piss off. I cant trust anyone anymore, except my soulmate. Even my best friend fucked me over. Stupid bitch. What the hell. She turned to drugs. Just like everyone else in this world. She's just another stupid poser who doesnt know who they are and never will and blame all their problems on others before realizing half the problem comes from the inside but their to lazy to fix it. Theyre all the same. Everytime I go to trust someone or care for them they just fuck me over. Why bother. She doesnt care about our friendship. She only cares about making her problems disappear with weed. Gee..what an intelligent thing to do. Turn to drugs to be happy. Whats the point of living if you have to have drugs to make it happy? Im joining the DTA club, The Dont Trust Anyone Club. Im so angry. Fucking hell. I just want to throw things and burn things. People seriously PISS ME OFF. I hate them all. Theyre all fucking pricks. DIE. ALL OF YOU. I just want to cry and cry. I never wanted to lose someone that meant so much to me. Screw it all. I hate you I hate you I hate you. You say you dont want to be like your dad, a drunk, so you dont drink. But yet you still get messed up with a drug. Its the same fucking thing. Youre a hypocrite. I dont care anymore. Just leave me alone. I know this is my first entry, but Im angry, Ill write more later about myself when Im in a better mood.

                               Today Brian and I went to apply at Wal-mart. Oh my god, their stupid little computer thing for filling out your application sucks! It took so long. I just hope that we get it, I didn't want to go through that for nothing. It was torture. We really didn't do much today. Brian played guitar for a little bit. I must say he really is improving and Im proud of him. He learned a Cannibal Corpse song in one night. I think he's really good and I just am amazed how well he can play. My Baby will make it with his music! He's too talented not to! I know this is short and boring, but I don't care. My tummy hurts and I just want to not think about anything and relax.

                  Well, some good news, Brian and I's search for jobs might be over. My grandma works at Walmart and she said they are hiring for new cashiers, and she said that she will talk to her boss and try and get us on. I mean thatd be great. I really hope we get them.                       Lately I have really been thinking about the future. It's so much closer than what I expected but you know, I think I'm starting to get ready for it. I don't feel that fear of starting school like I usually have and I'm really trying to get a job even though I really don't want to. However, I want a job so I can start saving to move out. I want to marry Brian and if we are going to get married when Im 19 then I need to start saving so we don't have to live with my parents for our first year of marriage. I mean I want to start our life together as husband and wife in our own home, not my parents.

                 I am avoiding doing chores, however its only 2 things, and it will only take 10 minutes tops to finish them both but I still don't feel like it. Im in my extremely Lazy mode and just don't want to move. I can't even force myself to get dressed. I hate these moods. Its not like I don't want to do anything, I just can't seem to force myself to get up and do it.                            There was something important I wanted to discuss, this time next year Im going to be starting college. That's a scary scary thought. Im not ready for it. Then the whole thing of Brian and I want to get married sometime around 19-20. Oh no, I dont think so. Im not ready for it. I mean I wont even be moved out yet. I can't handle that. Its going to have to be more along the lines of 21-24. I just don't feel this old. I still feel like Im 14 and I still feel like I look 14. How can I be growing up without changing mentally. I mean I have a realistic outlook on life and know what needs to be done, but the problem is forcing myself to do it. Now I get why people only end up being 45 and manager of Taco Bell. It's hard making it, and scary. All the things I've been dreaming of, marriage, a place of my own, my own car, my own money...I mean all of that isn't that far off from now and thats a really scary thought and makes me think Brian have a lot of work to do on our relationship before we even think about marriage. I just hope we grow up together and not apart.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose Im getting a job, atleast Im looking anyway. Technically not my choice, technically my father is forcing me too. But, I guess its for the best. Anyways, who cares about that right now. Today, Brian had practice for about 2 hours. It was fun and it made me excited that my Baby is living his dream and really just amazes me how talented he is. Im just so happy for him, although I feel like Im the only one happy about it. I would think hed be happy but he doesnt seem to be. I feel like maybe I shouldn't go to his practices. I don't know, I just think I'm in the way and that he just doesn't know how to tell me. Agh to depressed to write anymore.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, on my list of things, I forgot to put down one very important thing, get a job! How could I forget that, my parents have only been shoving it down my&nbsp;throat for the past 3 weeks. I had a talk with my mom this morning and told her that I'm not sure if I'm ready to work and do school. It's my Senior year and my grades last year weren't very good at all and so I want to really concentrate on doing good this year. On one hand it'd be good to do co. op. it shows responsibilty and Id get out of school early and get home earlier from work than I would if I went to school the whole day. Then on the other hand, I would have a lot more spare time than I would if I had a job. I just don't know. Im just so torn on what the right thing to do is. I should just face the music and get a job but on the other hand I don't know if Im ready for it. I just dont know what to do. Agh. Someone advice please, although no one ever comments. I just want to do the right thing but I just don't know if it's what I want. However...if I want to do the right thing, maybe the right thing is doing what I want and not what my parents want.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   On a lighter note and a happier note, Alex is coming over tomorrow and practicing with Brian! Im glad, I hope that they work on some stuff and maybe we can go looking for people to be in a band. I mean if we don't look...how else will we find people. Just waiting for people to come to you is just taking too long, I mean look how long it took us to find Alex.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today was a magnificently awesome day! Brian found a singer for his band! He's 18 and his name is Alex. He sings grindcore and is awesome!! He sounds really good and loud. You can actually hear him, let's just say that they are going to blow away a certain band. hehehe! Im really glad that he found a good singer. Thats really badass. They're having practice again on Thursday. I think they work pretty well together so far. He likes his lyrics and his style of playing guitar and they seem compatible. I really hope it works out. His girlfriend and him are extremely nice. Only one downfall, he smokes pot. Hopefully we can get him to stop. hehe! As long as he doesn't bring it around us we don't care. I hope that they find a bass and a drummer soon. That'd be awesome. I can't believe he has a singer!! Wow! So exciting!!

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for my pants to dry.&nbsp;I made my Baby cupcakes! I iced them and put sprinkles on them, I think they're cute if I do say so myself! Agh, has you eye ever itched but you can't itch it because youll smudge your makeup? Yeah, not a good feeling. Today Brian's going to call that Alex guy about being a singer...I'm so Excited!!! I really really hope that he's good and interested. I really want his band to get together, I know it means so much to him and no one deserves it more than he does! Time to check my pants! Ta ta!

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well today was a little more productive, I managed to get 3 out of 4 things done. Numbers:2, 14, and 17. Thats good. Im Happy about that. Oh and Exciting news! Brian got a call from a guy named Alex and he wants to audition for Misanthropical (Brian's band) and he sings death metal! Completly Awesome!! Im so Happy for him. Anyways, Today we went to the Woodlands Mall, big mistake. There was so much traffic because a light was out and then there was a concert going at the Pavillion so it took an hour and 15 minutes to get there! Unbelieveably crappy, I almost fell asleep driving. Brian bought his nose studs and a marilyn manson vinyl. Oh man Im feeling icky. We ate hot dogs for dinner and now I feel like poo.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to: Cannibal Corpse. Album:&nbsp;Gallery of Suicide.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I only managed to do 2 things on my list today, 1. Paint my nails black and 6. charge my cell phone. Wow, I didn't accomplish much. We were suppose to go to the mall today but it was raining really hard and Brian was really tired so we didn't. That didn't bother me, we're going to get Brian a nose ring thing, so it's not like its for me anyways. Basically Brian and I sat and watched movies all day. We only watched 2, Universal Soldier and Heartbreakers. It was fun and relaxing. I enjoyed it a lot. Tomorrow I have to shower and look nice for Brian. I just hope I have the energy and do it. Lately Ive just been so blah. Like I want to look nice but I just am so poopey feeling. Okay so tomorrows plan is to get numbers: 2, 14, 16, and17 done. Then that will&nbsp;only leave 11 things for me to do! Not to bad I guess, although those are the more harder things to get done.&nbsp;Painting my room I am sure won't happen. I wish, I want to paint it red. It'd look really cool. Then Id have like black bedspread with red sheets and red throw pillows. I want a new bed for my birthday, but I know that won't happen, besides my room is to damn small for a queen size bed. Anyways. Trying to think of something constructive to do, maybe work on my scrapbook.       &nbsp;Things for You to Remember: My Birthday, August 12!!

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know I've noticed, no one ever makes any comments on my journal. Which probably means that no one reads it...thats sad. Oh well..I guess Im not interesting enough. There are things I need to do but I just can't seem to get the energy to do them.      &nbsp;      &nbsp;&nbsp;List of Things to Do:      &nbsp; 1. Paint nails Black      &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Take a shower      &nbsp; 3. Fill out my job apps and turn them in.      &nbsp; 4. Get haircut      &nbsp; 5. Get eyebrows waxed      &nbsp; 6. Charge cell phone      &nbsp; 7. Diet      &nbsp; 8. Confront this person who is driving me nuts      &nbsp; 9. Take pictures of Brian and I      &nbsp;10. Work on my scrapbook      &nbsp;11. Paint my Room      &nbsp;12. Get my bed from Grandys      &nbsp;13. Get new sheets and pillows      &nbsp;14. Return movie      &nbsp;15. Go on a picnic with Brian      &nbsp;16. Buy some neccessites      &nbsp;17. Go to Woodlands mall today        &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Im sure there is more things, but for now thats all I can handle, and I know half of those things won't get done before school. Im sure that numbers:4, 7, 9,&nbsp;10, 11, 12, 13, and 15 won't get done anytime soon. *sigh* Need energy booster. Maybe go to Starbucks today? Coffee helps. Wow. The total boredom I have, yet I have so many things I need to do. Thats pretty bad. I can get number: 1 crossed off the list if Im just sitting here. Although I hate waiting for them to dry. Then that prolongs me taking a shower, which then means longer until I see Brian, which means even longer until we go to the mall, which closes at 6 and is 30 minutes away and that gives us very little time and Aghhh. To much to do so little time. I would say go to the mall tomorrow, but I am sure that Brian won't be happy about it since I put it off yesterday. I wish it was Saturday that way the mall would be open until 9pm. You know its rather stupid that the mall doesn't stay open until midnight. What bullshit. But what can you do? I know itd make my life so much easier. Especially today.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Yawn* I am rather bored right now. Tonight was okay. Brian and I didn't do much, but towards the end of the evening it was good, but then a little later I got depressed and started crying. I felt like Brian was getting sick of me and didn't want to be with me anymore. I've just been under a lot of stress and then the pressure of Brian and my doubting his love for me...I just kind of let loose. I feel horrible, lately I've been really bitchey and taking it out on Brian and Im just so sorry for it and I wish that I hadn't been. He doesn't deserve that. Not one bit, he's too good to me. Agh, I better stop talking about this or Im going to get depressed again. Anyways, Brian and I found a good pizza place, Jackpot Pizza. It sounds gay, but its really good. Although we only got one piece of it today because his siser and her 2 friends ate it all. His sister I know didn't eat much, but the other 2...man they woolfed that down, 2 Medium pizzas and we only got one piece. What shit. And we got no soda either, they drank the whole 2 lieter of Mr. Pibb. Which again wasn't Amy's fault. Pizza just isn't good without soda. Oh well.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just finished cleaning, however the house still looks crappy. It's rather irritating. My dad has crap pulled out all over the place because he's cleaning his room. I'm glad that he's feeling energetic and wants to clean his room, but does it have to be strung throughout the house? I guess so.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing really exciting to talk about, however I felt like writing. My dog is burying herself in my blanket...she's a very weird little fat dog, but cute! So, my dad isn't going to my grandma's for a week, which I was looking forward to. I don't mean that in a mean way...it's just whenever both are your parents are home all the time you really wish that you could get a break. See, my dad got hurt on the job and has A lot of physical problems and is unable to work anymore and is on social security. My mom was okay, but then one day she slipped and now she has a bulging disk in her back which causes her a lot of pain. She works for H.P. and now works from home, so both of them are home 24/7 and it drives me Crazy! I love my parents, but I wish that they would just like leave every now in then. I can't even remember the last time I was home alone. That really starts a lot of fights because we are always around each other, especially since it's summer.*sigh* I love going to my aunts in the Summer because shes so cool and Stef and I can do practically anything. We can sneak out at night, stay up late, and sleep in all day if we want, and just do whatever we feel like. Its so fun, but now that I have Brian I don't want to leave him. I was so miserable in Colorado without him, I know that I'd be just as miserable in Clearlake without him. Sometimes I just am overwhelmed, I cant seem to make everyone happy at anytime. Things just become rather stressful. Anyways! Brian and I were talking and the next time we make psghetti (speghetti) we are going to make our own special sauce! I really cant wait! It sounds so good. Ive never had&nbsp;a homemade sauce&nbsp;before. It would give us a chance to cook together! How cute is that! I wonder what we will do tomorrow! hmm.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay,&nbsp;I understand why there would be a lot of girls wanting my boyfriend. He really is one of a kind, hes sexy, sensitive, sweet, manly,caring...I mean just perfect!&nbsp;So, there are a lot of girls that like him and that hate me. Well, however, I am sick of girls throwing themselves at him and flirting and trying to wiggle their way in. They need to just Back the Fuck Off. I understand, I am no great prize and I have no idea why he picked me out of all people, but he did, and he loves me so therefore he is Mine. Why can't people understand that? And the even bigger question is, Why can't people accept that? It really bothers me how people are so insensitive of other people and their relationships and try to ruin them. What is it with people? Just because we're Happy doesn't mean that gives them the right to ruin our relationship just because their miserable. Im sick of it. I can't wait to be out of high school and to be married, then maybe if Im lucky girls will back the hell off. I hate it. Maybe this answers my question as to Why I have a clone? Pathetic and disgusting. There are millions..billions..of boys/men in this world, why cant everyone leave my man alone? I am Happy, He is Happy, We Love one another, We want to be married, We spend every waking moment of every day together...I don't think that anyone can break that up, unless we ourselves decide we aren't right for each other. But, I can guarantee that it won't be because of some little hussy. Brian and I share something that no one could ever understand. Our love is so deep and so connected, we belong together. We know it, my family knows it, our friends know it, and people who see us together know it, so Just Quit it and grow up. Have some decency.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't feel like taking a shower. I want to be clean, but I hate drying my hair. It's so long and it takes 25 minutes atleast to get it dry and its a pain in the ass. I love my long hair, and I would never cut it, I just wish there was an easier way. But, oh well. I wonder what Brian and I will do today. Oh, he pierced his nose! Its sexy! I like it a lot, now he has his labret and his nose..ohhh so hot!&nbsp;I wish my dad wasn't so anal about the whole piercing thing. I pierced my nose once but he made me take it out. I don't get whats so big about it, I mean a tattoo I understand, its permanent. A piercing is just a hole that will close, its not Forever. He just doesn't understand. He thinks they're ugly, but it's not really his decison. I just can't wait to be a little older so my life can belong to me, instead of my parents. I have no say in anything. I'm ordered around like a little servant, and I can't even get a piercing or 2. When does my life belong to me? When I had&nbsp;a job, my paycheck wasn't even mine. I had to save half of it and I mean yes thats good, but shouldn't I be the one to decide that, I am working for it. I can't ever sleep in or stay up late anymore. I used to stay up until like 5-6 am. and sleep until 3pm so fucking what? But no...I have to go to bed atleast by 2am and be up by 10 am at the latest. I don't understand what the big deal is? I mean, yes I have chores to do, but its not like they wont still be there when I get up. He just likes to control me and Im sick of it. I guess it makes him feel like a "man" to control my every move. Granted, I do get to go places and use the car, but a lot of times it's places for them. I do everything they ask me to but yet still to him I don't deserve food, clothing, to use the car, or have any of my stuff. I have to earn everything I get. Well, I've been cleaning this house ever since I was 7 yrs old. I think I've earned my fair share, and since I got my liscense..oh god. I go to the grocery store, I pick up all his medicine, I take him to the Dr. when he asks me to, I drive him places..like computer stores, I go everywhere and clean but yet its still to much to ask for to have a piercing and for sleep. I'm not asking for a later curfew. My curfew is 12am. I don't mind that. It's fine, and if I got to a&nbsp;late movie and get home around 1am, they don't care..I mean Im not asking to stay out late, I just want sleep and 2 piercings. I don't even get paid for this stuff, and I dont ask for money either. I dont care about money, its not an important issue with me. I dont know, maybe Im too spoiled and being ungrateful and shouldn't complain, but you know what, this is my journal and I can bitch all I want!

They can't have their own look anymore? They have to copy others? I mean, Im not attractive at all, but yet I have my own little clone who wants to look like me. God. Its irritating. I don't want people to look like me..and to be honest, why in hell would anyone want to look like me?? I just want my own style and for people to leave me alone. I don't get it. Can't anyone just be unique?

        Finally I'm back! I've been gone for like 2 weeks. I was in Colorado for one week, and then when I got back my computer broke. Then Ive been lazy and haven't wanted to type so..its like 3-4 weeks later! I guess Ill fill you in. Well, Colorado was a bore. I just missed Brian more than anything and realized how much I really love him. When I got back we spent like 5 days together straight, he stayed the night at my house most of the time, and I got to stay the night at his house once. It was a great welcoming home, being with my baby for 5 glorious days! Well..I dont really remember to much whats been going on. Brian and I went to see Spiderman2 for our 8 Month Anniversary! It was good, I really liked it. We also saw the Stepford Wives with Sabrina and Robert. It sucked. Then Brian and I saw I.Robot this last Friday, it was really good. Brian and I are both looking for jobs. Its Insane. I hate looking and appyling. Its so god damn annoying. But we're in the CO.OP. thing for school..so we have to get one. Hopefully Warehouse Music will hire us, that would be cool to work there. I don't really want to work in food, its just so icky. Chick-fil-a wasn't exactly a picnic and I don't expect any other place to be. Maybe a sandwhich shop just cause its not grease. Oh well. I just painted my toes black! Although they look crappy. Its not so easy to paint toes. This week-end my mom, dad, Brian, and me are going to Brownwood to see my grandma. Then my dad is going to stay there for like a week. I have no money. I want to buy a new cd and I can't. *wah* hehe. Well I guess thats it for now. Boredom has taken over.

        Yesterday was my birthday. I went to the DPS to get my liscense renewed...god what a frickin hassle that is. We got there and we were half way in line, then I remembered I didn't have any money, except the debit card, so we left and got some money. Then we came back, got all the way up there, and the lady asks for my V.O.E. (verification of enrollment) yeah, well school hasn't started and I didn't know I needed it. Okay, so then we saw Sabrina and Robert, they bought me cute presents! It was sweet of them. Then we went and rented movies and came back to my house and ordered pizza. We had fun. I got $160 in total and a birthday cake!          Today Brian and I saw Alien VS. Predator. It was pretty good, but not Great. Brian and I both got interviews for Wal-mart tomorrow morning! I'm hoping that we both get the job! It would be really good for us.          *Keep your fingers crossed for Brian and I tomorrow!!*

                                           Happy Birthday to Me!! Its 12am, and now officially my 17th Birthday. Nothing to exciting. Just something to gloat about. hehe! My parents and Brian and I are going to Carrabas for dinner tomorrow/tonight. Whatever you want to say. Anyways. Today, we didn't do much. We just kind of sat around and watched movies. We watched The Omen, it was really good. I am so bored. I have nothing interesting to say. Nor do I feel like thinking of anything interesting to say. I need to clean my room. No luck with that job, no one called. I wonder if they will...hmm. *Hopes*

                          It's been a couple of days, Sorry to disappont, hehe. Anyways, not to much has been going on anyway. My birthday is in 2 days...woohoo...not really, I couldn't care less. I applied at this office today for a job and the lady seemed to be rather interested and hopefully will hire me. I'm kind of scared and nervous about it. All these people are very much older than me, and the secretary makes me feel intimidated. I also feel that I won't be able to do the job since I have never had expierence in work such as that. I just hope that I can do my job well, that is if I get it. I'd only work on Monday, Wedensdays, and Fridays. Thats not bad at all. However, my paycheck shall suck. $6.50 an hour isn't bad, but if I'm only working 12 hours a week, that sucks. I don't know what exactly to do. In one way I hope they take me so my job search is over, in another, I hope they don't so I can get more hours. Although I think I hope more that they do take me. I'm more scared than anything, I don't care that much about hours, Im just scared. Please someone help me to get over that fear.                                Yeah, so I'm kind of sick. I have a small cold and I'm trying to make it die! I feel like poo-poo. I don't know what else is there. Brian called a man about making cabinets, and he seemed very interested, and said that he would call him in a week. Hopefully he is hired. I want some soup. However, I don't have any. Well, I'm thinking maybe I should rest. It might do me some good.                                *Keep your fingers crossed for Brian and I for our job lea ds*

        Music: Killswitch Engage...Album: Alive or Just Breathing...Song:Fixation on the Darkness  Well, a lot of information to put in. Yesterday was a very long long day. I went to the hospital around 10:30 am. and stayed there for a long time. Paul, Stef, and I went to go get something to eat at Whataburger and ate in the Cafeteria there. Then went back up and Paul and I sat and talked for an hour and a half and it was nice talking to him. Then by 5pm Paul, Stef, and I left the hospital to go to my house to get the truck. We went to my grandma's house to pick up my bed!! Yay!! I have a bed!!! *Big Smiles!!* And an excercise bike. Well on the way there we had to sit in so much frickin traffic it was unbelieveable. Then we had to go to Walmart and buy some egg crates for people to sleep on, and some stuff for psghetti (spegehtti, I just like that word! hehe). Then we sat in more traffic and finally got to my house, we started unloading everything. Then my mom called, Stef had taken my aunt's keys and they had no way to get home, so I had to run up to the hospital and take them the keys. I had tried calling Brian, but he wasn't home. So, I went home, and started making dinner, then Brian called. We talked a little bit, and I went over to his house. We sat and talked to his mom for awhile, and then we left and came to my house. My dad decided I was being bitchey and that I had to be in bed by 11pm so I had to take Brian home an hour early. Which sucked since I didnt get to see him until 9:30pm. Thats another reason I didn't get to post what happened yesterday, no time to. Then I went to bed. Now for what happened today.  Today my mom woke me up. My counselor called, she told my mom that I needed another year of Science, that she had screwed up by telling me that I only needed 2 (dumb bitch, I swear those counselors don't know anything, that is the easiest job in the world and they are horrible at doing it.) So, now I have to take I.P.C., fun (sarcasm). Then my CO.OP. teacher called to see if I had found a job yet, no I haven't, thanks for asking though...so I get to go up there on Monday to get a list of more jobs. Joy. Supposedly there are a lot of people that can't find jobs, so he is thinking of getting an extention for 2-3 weeks for people after school starts. Then I went and took Stef to get her nails done at 12pm. I came back home and Brian was online, I was shocked!! I talked to him, and he decided hed come to the hospital with me. So I took a quick shower and picked him up around 1:15pm and we went to get Stef. I took Stef to the hospital and Brian and I went back home. My mom was on a conference call and Brian, Paul, my Mom, and I were going up there later. We all watched gay MTV and then we Finally left and went to Jack In The Box and ate and then went to the hospital. We stayed for an hour and then I took Stef to Quiznos and to get gas. Then I took Stef back to the hospital and went to Taco Bell for my dad, I took him his food and Brian and I went to his house. We watched Wrestling and then his mom came home. Some crap happened with her boyfriend and yeah...but we left later after things were okay, and went to Taco Bell to eat dinner around and return movies around 11pm. We went back to Brians and ate and watched Full House, and then I had to go. I got home and talked to my mom and my cousin Brian for an hour and a half and laughed a lot! So yeah, thats been my past 2 days. Very stressfull. Oh and if you don't know why I have been going to the hospital, my grandfather had knee surgery, which is very painful. He's been losing blood and they had to hook him up to a blood bag to try and get his blood count up. Hopefully he's doing better, he's suppose to get realeased tomorrow and go to the Rehab. Not drug or alcohol rehab, for like helping you to learn to walk or whatever after an accident or surgery or something like that and youve lost function of that part of your body and youre learning to use it again. So he gets to learn to walk again. Well its 2am and I am beat. more tomorrow.  Impathy Tomorrow, at Java Jazz! Be there!

        Music: Slipknot...Album: Slipknot.....Song:(Sic)  Well yesterday...the morning sucked as usual. I had to go get job applications and fill them out and turn them back in...total annoyance. Then I saw Brian and he called Alex because we were suppose to go to Guitar Center and look for people to be in their band. Well, Alex's girlfriend didn't want to go, so we just went to Diamondhead and didn't even practice. That kind of pissed me off, but whatever. It was more a waste of time then anything. Anyways. Brian and I went back to his house, we watched Drew Carey and then went to Taco Bell and ate. We came back to my house, and sat in my room and talked a lot. It was nice, I got some stuff thats been bothering me off my chest and so did he. Good feeling. Then he had to go home. Got to go.

                                                      Today was a weird mixed emotion day. First it was ok, but then my parents bugged me about getting a job so then it sucked. I went and showered and got all dolled up, just so I could go to Klein Bank and get the wrong fucking thing. Then I had to go to the grocery store...and before I left my dad yelled at me, and I felt so frustrated I cried. So I cried and went to Brians. He cheered me up, as Always! *Thanks Baby!* We went to his house, so he could call Alex about practice. Well, he said that he was going to get something to eat with his girlfriend so he'd call back, this was at 5:15. 7:15 he called back! Finally he was ready to meet up. Then when we met and he could follow us back, he wanted to stop at Mc.Donalds...yeah, I thought he had just eaten too? Weird...I think so. So we did, and then they got down to buisness and started playing some kickass shit! They are getting really good together, and they've only had 3 practices (Total Hours=6) I just am so proud!! I can't believe how amazing he is! I know that they could really get somewhere when they get their band together! Tomorrow we are going to go look for people to capture! They are excited to get shit rolling! I am too...even though I don't do much. I just tell them what sounds good...fill the water glass...print stuff...drive...I mean I just do little odds and ends just to make things easier for my Baby!!                      *Hopes Brian and I get those jobs at Wal-mart* (Keep fingers Crossed!)

                                            Anniversary=6 days!  Birthday=9 days!                                                                 No call from Wal-mart. Hmmm. I mean I know it's only been like 2 days, and that the person who looks at the applications didn't come in until today, but Im antsy. I hope that we get the jobs. People keep bothering me about what I want for my birthday and I don't know, nor do I care! I don't want anything, I'm content. Except, I want to paint my room. Well, maybe I could use a new cd or 2, I have been bitching about that. Tomorrow Brian has band practice, woohoo. Im happy, I hope that they work on some more of that Zombie song, it's been going really well. Well, I better start making a list of shit that my family wants to buy me. hehe.

                                     Starting my diet today. Let's just see how long it lasts, I hope I stick with it. I'm going to try and excercise each day. We have a treadmill that we don't use, so I figure I'd walk on it for 30 minutes a day, and then my mom plans on getting an excercise bike. My thyroid Dr. said the best excercise is swimming and excercise bikes...and I don't have a pool and don't think I'll have time to go to the Y if I get a job and stuff. It's easier to do it at home.                                      I really want to get my room painted. I keep bugging my mom with it, I hope that they will get the paint soon. I'd do it myself, but she has to pick out the color of white...its reatarded. I hate waiting. I want to paint it before school starts.

                        Well today Brian and I waited around his house all day for Alex to call to finally tell us he couldn't come. We watched a movie and ordered pizza, which was fun, until the movie was over and we were full of pizza. Then we kinda got bored. Brian played guitar for awhile and learned some new Cradle of Filth songs within like 3 minutes! He seriously is amazing. I can't believe how fast he picks up things. Wow! Then we went to my house and got Jack in the Box which we had to wait for like 15 minutes all for it to suck ass. They didn't even give sweet and sour sauce for our eggrolls! What buttheads! So we started watching Halloween again, because the first time we watched it we both fell asleep, but then didn't get to finish it because Brian had to go. Then tomorrow we have to mow, and Alex wants to have practice since it's his day off. The problem is, we mow around 6pm and don't get done until 8pm and by then we are tired and don't want to do anything...so I don't know what we are going to do about that. On to other news.                          I decided exactly what I want for my room. I want to paint the whole thing white, then paint the baseboards black. Then one side of my door will be white (the outside that faces the hall) and the inside of my door will be black. Then I want to get a new desk that is more modern style and black, and then I have this little table thats kind of like an altar and I want to get a nice cover for it that is black with silver stars on it. Then I'm going to get an area rug thats fuzzy and black that covers this crappy tile. Then I want a canopy to go over my bed and black curtains. I'll have a black comforter and I don't think I like white throw pillows, so the whole bed just might be black or I could get purple or red ones even though it doesn't really go, but so what. Then I want to get this little butterfly chair thats black and fuzzy and then an ottoman thats checkered black and white and it opens and you can store stuff in it!! And I want a nice mirror and this cute silver clock. So yes, I need that job at Wal-mart rather desperatly now.
