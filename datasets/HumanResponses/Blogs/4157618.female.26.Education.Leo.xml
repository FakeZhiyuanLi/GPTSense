               One year ago today, I was in such a different place in life. Working two jobs, searching for a teaching job, and on the verge of losing hope. I had been searching for two years for what I knew God had called me to. I've always known that working with kids is where He wants me, but I was starting to lose sight of that. There were days when my hope and faith were battling my despair and confusion and I was ready to give up. Why was it taking so long to find a job? How much more did I need to give up? How many more times did I need to move? All questions stemming from the fact that none of this was what I had planned and was not even close to MY timeline of events. I had it all figured out and God was going to "bless it." Isn't that how it works? Life was by no means easy for those two years. I struggled with so many doubts and so much confusion. I continually wondered why God was putting me through all of it, and started questioning whether this was where He even wanted me.     It's funny to be in a position now to look back and realize what it was all for. To see where God led me and to realize what His plan was. He stripped me of MY plan and MY agenda for my life, and blessed me tenfold with His. I am starting my second year of teaching in two weeks, and I am so blessed by my school, and where He has placed me. I know that this isn't a forever thing and I may not be here as long as I have planned out, but I do know that I want to be ready for whatever He has in store. I would not trade a day from the past three years for the perspective I have gained. What a humbling experience to reminisce and remember...     "Many are the plans in a man's heart, but it is the Lord's purpose      that prevails."  Prov. 19:21--How often I've heard this verse, but how little I've ever let it sink in...

         As of last Friday I officially turned 26. Now it wasn't an amazing birthday celebration by any means, but it was an awakening of sorts. Birthdays have always provided an opening to allow selfishness to take hold and consume you for a day. I expected a day filled with fun, lots of attention, and nothing but laughter and happiness; ALL focus on me. What I got was none of these.    I went over to my parents house expecting the typical birthday celebration. Eating birthday cake, opening gifts, and enjoying one anothers company. Instead I stepped into a small warzone complete with yelling, crying, and tension-filled silence. The fighting had nothing to do with me, but unfortunately it felt like it did, since it was MY birthday. I walked on eggshells for as long as I could. I tried my best to put on a happy face and help set up for the bridal shower that was being thrown at their house the next day. It wasn't long before I couldn't stand it anymore, and left in frustration and tears...Why couldn't they put aside their issues for a day? Why didn't they care enough to at least mask their emotions? And WHY was I crying on my birthday?   Sitting at home alone that afternoon, gave me some time to reflect. Regardless of what I had just experienced, I was more upset with the attitude I had woken up with. Life is not about hoping others will make you feel good, or feel important. It's not about what other people are going to do or say to make you happy. My importance, my happiness, and who I am, cannot be rooted in others. Placing those things in the hands of others will only set me up for disappointment and failure...   "My soul finds rest in God alone; my salvation comes from him. He alone is my rock and my fortress, I will never be shaken."           Psalm 62:1-2
