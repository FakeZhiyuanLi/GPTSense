      Things  There are things inside me I don’t understand, Like why my life seems so happy when I feel so sad, Why do I think it’s time to play when there’s work to be done, Maybe cause there is no time for fun,  I wish I could just fly away in to the morning light, At least then I wouldn’t have to fight, Fight for all the things that don’t matter  Like how I comb my hair Still the things wind tight around me  So tight I can not bear,  So tight I can’t breathe or even think to do  What I want to do with you  Still I grit my teeth and try to understand  How my life is still around, How it’s not gone like all the other’s here lying on the ground  It’s not all wasted on drugs on booze   Or why I didn’t try  I work hard to live not knowing why I work hard to live, I work hard to stay alive  Still this my reward wondering why  They say don’t let your emotion’s take control  Just put them in your back pocket and don’t let them grow But when you suppress your feeling  This is all that comes out   Anger, hatred of your self and all that people have done And years and years of fighting that never will be won  Still we sit and wonder why things are  Things that need to go away far.

      So any way how have you all been no new poetry today just I feel like typing and so I am. OMG so any way this really ishy girl was being bitchy to me one day and so I said "someone's being bitchy today" (inside joke friends movie theater)anyway she's all did you just call me a bitch and I'm like all innocently no.then as if she can't even talk for her self the "queen bee" of their group decided to come and have "a word" with me. So she's talking and saying how I should wach my mouth or I'll end up with my ass getting kicked. And I told her I'm like "you don't want to mess with me I know people people high up" (like cops) I told her about my sisters probation officer and they must have miss heard me or something because next thing I know they all think my sister is a cop and shes only 16. so in conclusion I think that people should stand up for them selves!! Love ya :) xoxoxoxooxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxxoxxoxox, this is my hugging and kissing you! jk!

      Omg so much news so little time, my Birthday is in 2 days and my party is in 6! This is going to be the best party ever! But I still have to clean (the bathroom, the living room, the kitchen, and my room), finish tileing the basement, go get  and  put up decorations, and get food so I’ve got my work cut out for me! So anyway I just got this creepy message from this really biznichy girl monkey something and she wouldn't tell me anything about how she got my name or why she had it just that her friend gave it to her so that was kinda creepy! But yea if you read this and your her friend or her tell her that she is/you’re a biznich and you/she is not to ever IM me again and she/you can KISS my BUMBUM!
