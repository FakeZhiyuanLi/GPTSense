      Today was a pretty good day. I made up with a friend that I haven't spoken to in seven months. We talked on the phone for a little bit, and then I went over to her place to hang. As I was driving there, I felt this crazy knot in my stomach begin to form. It was like when you are going somewhere really unfamiliar to you for the first time. But the craziest part was that it wasn't even weird once I got there. It   almost   felt like nothing had happened. Of course there were a few awkward silences and stares, but for the most part it was good. It was a good day!!!   Word of the day: Funky Diddle!! As in...."I guess you didn't want none of this funky diddle!"&nbsp;

      So I am officially once again a cyber-stalker!!! Let me explain myself, before anyone gets worried. Well, even after I explain myself you may be worried, but whatever!!   So about a year ago, I get this random thought in my head about this guy Marco that I went to grade school with. Yes, you heard me right, grade school!&nbsp;Considering what a small school it was and that I am still in touch with a handful of those people, it not completely out of the realm of sanity. But wait, here is where it gets sketchy.....I decide to go online and try to find this Marco that I can't get out of my head. I google his name and find out a bunch of stuff about him. I.E. where he went to college, his major, and even his job/internship thingy. AND I find his phone # in his college student directory. So for like 3 months, I am obsessing about finding this person.....but I am not exactly sure a.) what to say to him if I did call. and b.)why the hell am I so interested in the first place. I decided to write a letter to him instead. I wrote it, sealed, and stamped it....but I never sent it. This process seemed to get the thoughts out of my head. I have been fine, up until an hour ago.....I was reading an article, and a guy interviewed just so happened to have the name Marco.....not my Marco, but just a Marco. So you prolly know what&nbsp;happened next!!! YE...He's back in my friggin' head!!! So now what am I supposed to do??? For the past year, something has been telling me that I need to&nbsp;talk to this person... for some reason my&nbsp;being thinks that this random soul needs to be in my life. What is this about?????  Word of the day: Crunk =)

      So I haven't posted in awhile.....that's because nothing interesting is going on right now. I will&nbsp;once again say that I have had my fill of school this semester. I officially have 2 weeks left. It's about damn time.  I am gonna try to make it up to DC after finals, sometime in August. I really miss my Mom and the girls. It's kinda weird being so far outta the loop down here. I haven't talked to my Dad in like three weeks...I think that is kinda weird. But I probably won't even see him when I go up. It's always hard to go see him and that side of the fam. Things are so fucked up in that house....I feel really bad not telling them I am up, but it is so stressful and it really makes me sad going there. Without even knowing it, they always put me in the middle of their BS. Sometimes I feel like I am the adult in that situation. I knows things aren't good their, but damn.....put on a happy face, when your daughter you only see twice a year is in town.&nbsp;C'est la Vie!  Word of the Day:&nbsp;&nbsp;BLAH!!

        Sometimes I amaze even myself......let me paint you a little picture!!   I am at work minding my own business, when out of no where a guy enters the store asking if we want to buy some amazing orangy cleanser stuff. We were bored, so we let him do his little demo bit. He took&nbsp;a lipstick stain out of his&nbsp;shirt, and showed us how&nbsp;finger prints won't smudge windows blah blah blah.&nbsp;By the end of it, Krystal and I were convinced. Well actually Krystal was convinced, but her excitement about it made me want it too. So we bought it.....dumb dumb dumb! So after dude left we started cleaning&nbsp;the whole store, we were stoked.&nbsp;Well, for some crazy reason, finger prints are still on our windows and Krystal tested the lipstick theory on her own shirt...guess you know what happened there!! Exactly....NOTHING!!! There is still a fucking stain on her shirt.   SO,&nbsp;Needless to say, we ended up buying $64 dollars worth of Windex!!!!!! We are fucking morons!!!

      &nbsp; So Michelle and I are fine again....I figured it would only take a few days to blow over! I am so happy about that. My flipping movie paper is finally out of my hands. Turned it in today, and I hope I never see it again. So now that that class is over, I only have to go to school 2 days a week. I am thrilled!! Now I only have my big huge 'generations' paper to do and I will be home free.   Christy and I went to Starbucks tonight and I had yummy green tea. There is something about tea that is soothing. It really helped ease the tension I have been feeling about everything. &nbsp;Yippee for tea!!!   As far as anything else goes, nothing too exciting to share. I get my first paycheck this week and I finally have insurance!!! This may not seem like a big deal to most, but to me it is great!!! Medical bills are the worst kinds of bills to have. Trust me.  &nbsp; Word of the day: Crapity-crap-crap!!!

      &nbsp; I want this semester to be over with.....I am so completly over this whole "higher education" BS. Just give me the fucking piece of paper and let me be on my way!!! Damn!!! Who was the genious person who invented it anyway? Not me, that's for damn sure, and even if it was me I certainly would not make it take four fucking years to get it done.......I took this damn film class thinking it was going to be a great GPA booster, when in fact it is becoming my downfall! 7-10 page paper my ass.....what the hell more can I say about a freaking Clint Eastwood film!!! Nothing that's what....I have said everything I want to say in 6, but NOOOOOO that's not good enough. If I don't have the minimum page length then I will get points taken off. SO she would rather me&nbsp;BS two fucking pages with filler, then actually have a good compact paper that says everything needed. WTF???  &nbsp; On a different, but still equally as frustrating topic.....Michelle is pissed off at me for a reason unbeknownst to me! Supposedly I am not spending enough time with her! She claims that I have all the time in the world to hang out with my roommates, but not with her!! FUCK!!! It's like I am dating her or something.....it's not like I set out to not go out with her, it's just a matter of randomly wanting to go get a beer or whatever and my roommates happen to be the closest people to ask if they wanna go!! It's not some big conspiracy against Michelle!  &nbsp; Words of the day: BITE ME!!!

      So today was my last official day of film criticism class.....we watched Citizen Cane......supposely it is like the all time best movie critically speaking!!! I personally didn't see it. In fact I found it to be a bit blah. Oh well, I guess that is why I am not a film reviewer or whatever!!! &nbsp; So I have noticed working at Nextel that there are a hellova lot of rednecks and freaks with cell phones! In the short three weeks that I have been working there I have seen guys with racing stripe hair (don't even ask me to explain that one) a guy that told me he was on prozac and levitra (the erectile dysfunction pill) and&nbsp;I can't even &nbsp;tell you how many times I've heard "WOOOOOO!!! Junior!" ie: Dale Jr. or some shit!!! I am even catching myself talking like them.....god help me!!! &nbsp; Me, Christy, and Craig went and played pool tonight.....we both whooped Craig's ass! He was getting so pissed!! It was funny! Saw Kyle Foy from Catholic there, but I didn't say hi!!! Ok off too bed!!! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Word of the day: thingamabobber!!!!

      Ok, this is my first attempt at this whole blogging thing....I am a bit skeptical of myself, in that I have a tendency to not finish what I start. Especially since I have nothing interesting to write about.  Speaking of which...Do you ever feel that your day, week, life is just once giant repetitive swirl? You know when you talk to someone on the phone and you are like "what's up?" and they are like "nothing what's up with you?" Why do we still ask each other that question? Nobody actaully answers with any kind of dramatic oh my god answer. It's always the same..."nothing, what's up with you?" Well to answer that question for everyone wondering.....NOTHING!! Nothing is up! I get up, I go to work, I sell a phone or two, I go to school, doodle a bit, and then drive my happy ass home to take my shower and go the hell to bed. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to bitch. I am happy with what I am doing....I am happy as hell that I have a job....but I haven't had alot of time to catch up with friends. I miss my friends! I think I have become a bad friend actually....oh man I don't want to even get into all of that! We'll save that for another day I guess!!    WORD OF THE DAY: Discombobulated

      So it's been awhile huh? But at least I am still coming back after my hiatus......  Alot of things have happened in the past 2 weeks or whatever it has been. I went up to DC for a few days to see the fam. It was a very last minute trip, which came about after a huge guilt trip from the entire crew over some damn family picture. Needless to say it was not one of my favorite trips up. It was raining, everyone was bitchy, and I would have much rather been at home. It was nice to see my Mom though. I miss her alot. It's weird seeing someone nearly everyday of your life, and then not. Know what I mean? My relationship with my mom is unique. We are so close, but yet not. I don't know how to explain it. But I do miss her immensely. Her birthday is on monday....I can't forget!!  Hmm...other news. That 'friend' I was talking about last post......we are back to not talking. It is way better this way. While I truly miss having her as a friend, there is so much other stuff that I just can't deal with. I don't even know how to explain it, only to say there are some people, that no matter how much it sucks, you are better off without. I am not saying that I am better off witout her. I am not saying that at all. But I think that WE are better off without EACH OTHER!! It's weird.  More....School''s out finally. Finished my last exam on Monday. I could not be happier about that. This summer session totally kicked my ass. Maybe it was because I started work in the middle of the semester, but no matter what it was, it sucked!! I am hoping that Fall Semester will be better and more fun. I registered yesterday and I decided to try and take 5 classes instead of just 4. Music, American Politics, Old Testament, Intro. to Counseling, and Gender in the Workplace. I figured I would register for all 5 and then see what the work load is going to be and see if I can handle it and work too. Who knows? Keep your fingers crossed.  I hurt the fuck outta my hand playing tennis yesterday. It is swollen and sore and shitty!! and Work is good....but I am having a crappy month in sales. Anyone need a new phone?? and Our water is back on!! WOOHOO...DO THE WATER DANCE! We were outta water for a day or so because there was a water main break in our apartment complex. It sucked! You never know how important something is until it's gone. I will never take a hot shower for granted again. Christy and I went to Radek's place to shower tonight....we were gross from playing tennis last night and then working all day without a shower!! yeah it was rank!  Ok I think I have gone on and on long enough. Until next time.......
