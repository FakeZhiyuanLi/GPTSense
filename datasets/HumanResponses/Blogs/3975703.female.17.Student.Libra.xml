       Man, I am so tired! Not even just physically tired, but emotionally tired. I am just tired of bullshit and tired of having to explain myself and people I care about. I am tired of having to walk on eggshells all the time. I am tired of feeling like everyone is against me. I am just SO tired. I don't know exactly what triggered this feeling, but as of now, I feel like I should just give up on everything. (No, that is not a suicidal thing, don't worry) Lately, I have felt like I have done so much to make everything peaceful and easy rolling, but it seems like the more I try to do that, the more bad comes out of it. I leave my house for one night, and my mom completely flips out on me because my friend forgot to give me a message. I go to practice and I feel like I am not good enough, even though I put in 110%. I feel like I have to watch every move I make or I will destroy something in my life. I just wish that I could feel .. I don't know.. relaxed and easy going. Sara and I were talking about this last night. We were talking about how she is much more personable than I am, but it is only because I keep my guard up until I get to know someone because I have been hurt so many times. I have gotten alot better, but sometimes I just feel like I should stand back and see if anyone comes and talks to me. I don't want to try anymore than what I have to because I feel that when I do, I get stepped on. I am really afraid for the play to end, because with that, some of my confidence might go. I feel so much better about myself since the play started. Most of the cast makes me feel like I am something. My clique (Sara, Johnny, Cody, Sam) always make me feel like I am the greatest person ever. The group of people I just met (Madison, Joel, Laura, Jenessa, Daniel, etc) make me feel like I am so much fun to be around. People who I never thought I could talk to, even if I had to have made me feel like I belong. I don't know, maybe I just have a complex. I know I will have people after the play is over, like Josh, Sara, Cody, and Johnny, but all of these new and interesting people that I have met wont be there. I just need to live it up while I still can. I need to enjoy this last week with everyone. I need to enjoy this last month with my friends who are leaving me, and even the ones I will still see. I guess I just know the inevitable is coming, and I am just scared. I NEED TO BE HAPPY! I will be fine. I am just having a down day. Thank you to everyone though who has been there for me. I don't think I say thank you enough. You do so much for me. Big things like being my confidante to small things like smiling at me to let me know that everything is cool. THANKS     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Ok, no more depressing stuff. I feel better now that I vented. I am pretty excited for Thursday. We are having a cast party. I always have so much fun at those.&nbsp; Tonight should be fun too. Josh and I are going out and doing something. I am not exactly sure what yet, but it will be fun. It always is. :) But anyway, I am going to go. I have to cheer up!     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   IEEEEEEEEEE! (lol)     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;      &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

        Today was a fun day, for the most part. I woke up at 8:30 and enjoyed a wonderful episode of Yu-Gi-Oh! Everyone should watch that show, it is absolutely wonderful! S after that, I sat around and at 11 I finally decided to get ready for practice which started at 1:30. I got to practice 15 minutes early and hung out with some peeps. Then from there we worked with the orchestra     which took FOREVER! Wefinally got out of there at 5 and then I came over to my cousins house until I figure out what is going on later. So as of now I just got back from getting a slurpee and taking a walk with my wonderful cousin Amber. She is just great. Can't you tell I am in a strange mood? Yea. So I think that Josh needs to get back from Cadillac REALLY soon. I miss the kid! But anyway, I am going to go.. peace and hair grease!        &nbsp;      &nbsp;    Come see   The Pirates of Penzance&nbsp;             &nbsp;    Aug 4th thru 7th        &nbsp;    Be there        &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;    Tami

       Hey y'all! So today&nbsp; I went to practice and we ran through the whole show, which went pretty well. I have a rehearsal Sunday for over 3 hours so hopefully that isn't painful to be at... if you know what I mean. So as of now I am at Josh's house. We just went Putt-Putt golfing at Dutch Village which kind of sucked. Josh lost his ball on the 3rd hole and I lost mine on the 16th. It was so dark that we couldn't see anything. Oh well, it was still fun. Then after that Josh took me to McDonalds and bought me a sundae, which by the way was delicious. Now I am sitting here. Fun stuff. I should probably go spend some time with Josh. I just wanted to write in here.. just because.    &nbsp;  Love Always,    Tami    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  My thought of the day:  Karma is a bitch

       Don't ask about the title again. So right now I am sitting at SAras house hanging out with her and Sam. It is good fun. Today at practice the Bay City Times came and took our pictures which was absolutely retarted. I don't know, they just seem to pick favorites and I really don't like that. I can't make this entry long because I have things to do. So yea, tomorrow is the dreaded kissing scene between me and Tony. I am quite nervous because I just hate stage kisses. Oh well. You gotta do what you gotta do. Well anyway I am going to go, Sara and Sam call.    &nbsp;  Love Tami    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Yea, don't ask about the title. Today was a pretty fascinating day. I sat at home until about 5, and then I went to play practice @ the Players. We ran the whole show (The Pirates of Penzance) which went okay. The show is supposed to be able to be completed in 90 minutes but it takes us over two hours. Not good. Then one of the little kids that I have taken under my wing comes up to me and tells me that her cousin commited suicide and started crying. I felt really bad for her, and I didn't really know what to say to her except to explain to her my situation with my brother.. if you don't know about that, you can ask. She is just so young though so it is really hard for her to comprehend. She is only like 11 or 12. Poor girl.&nbsp; Oh, and I have also come to the conclusion that I hate some people that can't say anything nice about people. You know, the ones that like you when their friends aren't around and when their friends are there they act like you are a piece of shit. You know who you are. You suck. Anyway, I am sitting at my wonderful boyfriend Josh's house. He has to be bored out of his mind. Poor lad, poor lad. So yea, everyone should come and see *The Pirates of Penzance* on aug 4th-7th. I'm not sure how much it costs but any price will make it worth it. There is action, and love, and really cheesy opera singing. All will enjoy. If you want to know more about it, there will be an article in the local magazine *Interlude* and there will also be an article in the Bay City Times. It WILL be awesome.  Well I am going to go, I love you all &nbsp; &nbsp;
