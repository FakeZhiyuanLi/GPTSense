      i've been busy the last two days...  but i had fun.  the last day of bible day  camp was pretty fun.  erin elbowed stanley in the face right in front of cameron.  he told me "if i had known you had to deal with  her  all week, i would have given you an award."  she usually wasn't bad, though.  i picked faith for honor camper, cause she was slightly better then the other kids.  sarafina didn't listen to me sometimes, stanley punched me in the balls, erin elbowed stanley, and rachel, just no.  she's a cute kid, but definitely not honor camper material ;).  let me see.... what else happened.... yeah after bible day camp i kind of sat around and cleaned up my room.  i ran almost 9/4s of a lap without stopping, which is almost a mile.  yay.  i didn't have time to lift weights, but i played lacrosse and went to the bookstore to get a copy of "the double helix" (summer reading for tj).  then i went to aly's house cause she was giving me a ride to laser tag.  oh man... her parents are so much cooler than mine.  her dad was like singing the munchkin song from the wizard of oz, and her mom was all friendly.  its weird, but i felt comfortable around em.  plus, aly's whole family loves the simpsons.   lol we were talking about the south or something and her mom was like "lucky ah don't hahve ain accent."  when i talked to her on the phone it was really strong.  aly doesn't apprieciate her parents :P  anyways, at laser tag, it was pretty cool.  svetska and her little entourage came, david was there, bobby was there, me, aly, and someone else i'm forgetting.  nick didn't show... he was watching the village.  more on that later.  i did pretty well for a few of the games (i came close to david at least once, but man he's pretty dang good).  for some reason i felt like people were avoiding me, but maybe thats just a result of me being retarded.  im pretty sure its my fault i feel that, not other people.  i can see the individual pixels on my screen right now.  it's pretty cool.  i went home with aly (more entertainingness) at like ten thirty  (got home around eleven fifteen), and decided to make some money.  me and my sis and my mom all got into it, wrapping coins and such.  my mom lets me keep all the pennies and nickels i wrap (i'm putting them towards my new debit card account thing).  i ended up with almost $30 in my pocket.  i got to sleep around one ten.  this morning, i woke up and went to help peter tobiasson with his eagle project (building a footbridge).  we mixed concrete and got dirty and such.  nick was there (he's peter's friend), so i talked with him and other nerds about nerd stuff.  pretty fun (but tiring).  then i went home and started cleaning my room again.  it's going to be awesome. then i started reading, stuff happened, scott came over (he's still here) and he's hanging out with danny, im typing this, the world goes on, etc.  church tommorow (aly and nick aren't going to be there, and i have extended session).  i have to mow two lawns.  gah.  see ya later.  ~stephen

      lots of stuff to write about.  today has been a busy day.  at bdc, the kids learned about paul and one of his trips where the boat he was on crashed.  erin and sarafina sat on my legs and lap till i made em get off cause my limbs began falling asleep.  in games they did track and field stuff.  ginny looked kinda tired... i guess those 6th graders are pretty bad.  i still need to find a birthday gift for her... i'm running out of time.   maybe ill see something on vacation.  anyways, then we went to music.  moogie was wearing these bright pink mesh shorts, and ray white the music guy had on this faded pink shirt.  lots of pink.  the kids were sitting fine in the chairs, except for (you guessed it) rachel, who wanted to sit on the floor, and stanley who wanted to lie down across his and rachel's chair.  eventually everyone (including mr white) ended up on the floor.  haha when everyone but stanley (who was half asleep) was on the floor sitting, mr white told him to sit on the floor cause everyone else was and stanley was like "stephen isn- oh."  that was funny.  anyways, then rachel started crawling and rolling around, and somehow everyone (including rachel and stanley)  somehow ended up sitting normally in their chairs... après ça, we went to crafts where the kids finished their little container thingis.  aly and that lady came up with snacks, and i got a little bit (well actually a big bit) of cake type stuff and hid it behind my back.  little did i know that rachel was standing right behind me.  quick as a flash she grabbed it and before i turned around she had it all in her mouth.  she was standing there with an innocent look on her face (stuffed with cake - she had so much in there she couldn't even shut her mouth).  i had to try hard not to laugh - she needs to be disiplined, right?  or something.  i dont like to punish em O:-).  during crafts, i went down to ginny's area to get rachels nametag (she hates the thing) and to talk to people for a while.  then, my group went to snacks.  the little kids for some reason think im going to marry aly, and erin keeps saying "you two just kissed" and "you're gonna lip kiss".  i remember those days.  those were good days.  yeah. being a little kid.  anyways, we had these really tasty scones and all the other counselers were laughing at me cause i was sitting at the little table with the little kids stuffing my face (hey, i deserve a treat every now and then!).  after bdc, i went home and went like straight to go shopping with my mom for stuff for my room.  the pbteen magazine inspired me to destr- er... rearrange my room again, so today i went shopping.  i got this thing thats like a "dorm space saver" or something and its like a shelve that goes over my bed.  its pretty cool.  i also got these like stackable mesh cube typy things.  they're kind of hard to describe.  but cool, nonetheless.  i've decided i'm going to move out my dresser and bed, and turn the day bed into my regular bed.  im going to clean out my closet and underneath my beds, and now all my clothes are going in my closet and im going to have lots and lots of empty space in my room.  yay!  this is going to be fun. im also going to get rid of and/or clean off my bulliten board.  im really excited... and now i feel like a girl again :P.  i went to bed bath and beyond, the container store, and "linens 'n things" and actually somewhat enjoyed myself.  haha im a dork.  anyways, my room will be much cooler before school starts.  when i got home from shopping, i discovered that the laptop memory i ordered (yesterday) had arrived.  i was all set to install it, when i realized that i had never seen a screwdriver small enough to handle the things i had to unscrew.  so mom and i went to radioshack (after trying every screwdriver in the house) and just bought like a $5 set of screwdrivers, which worked almost perfectly.  almost.  i got three of the four screws out, but the forth one got like ruined by the screwdriver.  i was really mad at it.  i almost ripped the little metal plate out of the laptop, but i decided that probably wouldn't be smart.  i finally figured out that i could just rotate it.  stupid me.  anyways, after that (probably like an hour later), i installed the memory, and it appears that it is working perfectly.  i ran today, longer than i have before (almost a mile now, with half of it uphill).  im in the process of cleaning my room so i can move stuff around.  i found this old cap gun, and started shooting it off outside at like ten o'clock.  i dont think the neighbors are too happy.  meh.  things are looking positive in my money situation.  i calculated it, and if i dont spend or make any more money (other than lawn mowings), ill end up with approximently $15 at the end of the summer.  of course, lauren svetska needs her computer fixed, and she said shes willing to pay up to $200 for it.  im going laser tagging tommorow, which is like $11, and im probably going to spend money on stuff for the vacation.  im about to send in the rebate form for my printer, so that wont cost me, and im about to get a checking account (with a debit card!!!!), so i'll make like fifty cents interest over the year. lol.  im excited about that too.  well, ive been typing for like thirtyfive minutes or so, so ill stop here.  g'night.  ~stephen

      i need like a notepad or something to carry with me.  something funny happens, and i'm like "i need to put this in my blog," and thirty seconds later i've forgotten. anyways, now i'll try to remember my day.  krissy had an interesting incident with her car this morning.  apparently the battery or something just died, and her jag stopped working.  she tried to get it to turn around so it could roll down the hill, but that didn't work, so she ran home and got her mom to drive her to bdc.  as far as i know, if aaa hasn't come yet, it's still sitten in the middle of the road.  the jaguar just died... lol  rachel came in to bdc today with a bruised lip.  apparently mark threw a ball at her.  the way he tells it, though, he threw a ball up, and she walked under it and looked up :P.  when we were in the bible story place, the lady (faith's mom) gave rachel a little card that said "athens" (we were "studying" paul's journey) and she goes "atheeeeeeennnnnnsssssss" in this little girl voice and i was like awwwwww and like hahaha at the same time.  that was the first thing i was like "you have to remember that" with.  and i did.  yay. oooooo i just remembered something else.  in games, we decided to play a game called walk the plank or something (sharks and minnows, just without a pool), and i was running from the kids.  i ran forward, and a little bit to the left, then suddenly juked left and sprinted.  i ended up like scraping against the wall, which slowed me down and tripped me.  me, the counseler, flat on his face in front of a gym full of screaming kids along with like va, vlad, patrick, and who knows who else looking from the snack room.  it was fun :D  a bit of personal harm is acceptable if it gets a laugh ;)  i went home, walked in the door, grabbed my board, and skated for a while.  i ran into a coupla other skateboarders who said they were 14 and lived "around here."  i thought i saw one of em before, but he was smoking, so im not sure.  they were better than me. after awhile i went inside and worked on my math packet for tj for a bit.  there's some magazeen called pbteen or something that actually had some cool stuff for rooms in it.  plus, it had like an apple product in every room, just convienently sitting there.  they had these skateboarding decks that had been turned into shelves or something.  interesting.  plus they had this other cool stuff that is cool... i guess their catalog type thing worked - i considered for a second asking my mom if i could move to the basement just so i could buy the stuff in there. lol if i could get them to design my room, that would be quite cool.    doo doooooo i wish there were an empty room or something i could put stuff from there in. and then go live there.  i feel like such a girl. lol well im off to play laccrosse at the moment.  no one reads this anyways :P  ~stephen

      this is so cool.  it's raining, and the water is like ankle deep on the sidewalk and in the road. :-)  earlier, when it was just raining a little bit, i went out and danced in the rain.  that was pretty cool.  just now, it's pouring and i got soaked after a couple of seconds.  still very cool though.  before it rained (actually  right  before it rained, i was outside skateboarding and i think i finally actually did my first ollie (still in the grass, but im pretty sure it was a real ollie).  a while ago, i thought that i had ollied, but then i realized later that it wasn't.  now, though, i think i've got it.  i just have to get off the grass and onto the pavement now.  yay.  after i did that, actually this deserves it's own paragraph.  i was skating, and i saw my basketball hoop, and suddenly it hit me.  why not try to shoot a basket with my skateboard?  so there i was, throwing my skateboard at the basketball hoop.  completely oblivious to the fact that there is a bee's nest in my basketball hoop.  now, i knew that there was (i've throw stuff at it before), but i just forgot this time.  the skateboard is halfway to the hoop when suddenly bees start zooming past my head.  i'm thinking "holy mackerel!", and i run away.  after the bees calm down a bit, instead of stopping, this genius decides to do it again, just to watch the bees.  at one point, my skateboard got stuck on the basket (hanging off by one wheel).  i had to slap it down and run from the bees, while hoping that the board wouldn't fall on me.  sheesh. still, i was laughing out loud afterwords, so i'd call the whole event a sucess ;)  actually i'm not online at the moment (storm made my mom turn off the network), so this would be a good time to work on the cousin movie.   peace  ~stephen

       urlLink palindromes  this is pretty cool.    i kind of want to see the village, but im not going to if its not with my youth group.  problem is, it comes out on friday, and on sunday im leaving for ten days, so chances are they'll see it while im gone (unless i can get people to see it friday instead of going laser tagging, which is what we were planning).  i usually dont see scary movies, but im changing my mind.  i kinda want to be freaked out.  oh man, that reminds me.  the village is directed by m. night shamalan (however you spell that), who also directed signs, unbreakable, and the sixth sense.  i saw unbreakable with my friend a long time ago, and the whole night we slept over he was scared of some guy in an orange jumpsuit killing him.  to be honest, i was a little scared too, but i couldn't show it ;) his mom said no one would rob their house cause of the toys in the front, the uncut grass, etc. thats interesting.  if your house looks crappy, maybe no one will rob it (im not talking about ur house, johnny) ill ask people tommorow, i spose. actually, johnny was just telling me about how he saw the exorcist the other day at like midnight.  he described a little bit of it, and it sounds pretty freaky (not to mention inappropriate).  i got sweet tarts in the crafts place today at bdc.  mmmmmmm...  haha i was holding the kid's little thingis that they made in crafts, and i had given everyone's back except stanley's, so i was talking to nick and i asked him to put it in the little bag for tommorow cause i had "lost stanley" right in front of stanley's mom (she works in the office).  i completely forgot that that was her.  doh.  i got a new kid in my group named matthew or something.  during games, he was like "hip hop rules!"  and earlier during music, faith and erin (two little girls) were going like "yo yo yo whats up dawg".  these are first graders! i think i'll tell my homies over at  urlLink JfH  about this blog.  so far, ive only told va. i hope i didn't make a mistake switiching to japanese... i'm pretty excited cause i dont think many kids are taking it next year, which means there will probably only be one japanese 1 class, which means the other like two kids who are taking japanese from longfellow will be in it.  coolios.  i really dont want to go on vacation... i want to hang out at home and such.  oh well.  i dont really have a choice.  oh yeah i just remembered i was gonna ddo a little mini review of the bourne supremacy.  it was pretty dumb.  the book was a lot better.  INTERESTING FACTIODY THING:  the guy who directs those movies accidentally killed off an important character in the first movie cause he hadn't read the book.  idiot ;)  nick is a really funny guy.  he has this old cell phone, and he dropped it in the middle of our skit.  somehow that turned it on, and a few seconds later someone called him.  turns out it was a wrong number, but right after he hung up he was like "..... it's jesus!" we all cracked up.  we were pretty goofy this afternoon... yup well thats all i can think of to say at the moment. peace  ~stephen

      bible day camp was pretty cool today.  lots of stuff happened.  at the beginning of the day, a lady talked to the kids about a country called angola where she's visiting or something.  apparently they dont have shoes and stuff.  she was passing around pictures (all the time talking to everyone like they were babys), and at one points she said in a little cutsy voice "here's a picture of a little girl who had her leg blown off by a land mine" i was behind the little screen, so i didn't see the picture, but i was a little suprised.  these are little kids (both in the picture and seeing the picture)! anyways, after the pictures, we did songs for the little kids.  i think we did the milk song (goosh goosh goosh goosh), the fast food song (mcdonalds, mcdonalds, kentucky friend chicken and a pizza hut), and the fruits of the spirit song (love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfullness, gentleness and self controooool)  rachel is a cute little kid.  nick thinks she's like the spawn of satan though :P when bdc was over, she hugged my sister, then saw me and backed up, saying "no hug for you!".   anyways, im off to see the bourne supremacy with simon.  ill write more later  ~stephen

      some other stuff  stanley is in my group too he's a cool little guy  but really the coolest kids are in the 2nd grade.  nicole, john (although he's in summer school... i dunno why - it's second grade, for pete's sake!), billie (even though she likes to jump all over me), and probably others that im forgetting.  aly had her heart set on getting the 2nd graders, but some girl who only comes for bible day camp is leading em instead.  aly really cheesed off cameron cause she kept asking to switch (at least according to va).  aly and i led the first graders last year.  i'm gonna try and get the third graders next year O:-)   although cameron might let us share em...  eh it's next year.  whatever.  we shall see if this blog still exists then.  in other news, the olympics are starting soon, i think.  ooh yeah lance armstrong won the 6th tour de france the other day.  my old french teacher will be happy.  she like loves him.  i figured out what was wrong with my laccrosse stick.  i was holding it too low (towards the bottom), so the ball always went like straight towards the ground.  yay. oh man... i really want to like revive the expression "that was so funny, i forgot to laugh."  that makes me crack up every time. dont ask me why.    my cd collection now consists of eleven cds!  woot woot.  1 relient k cd (two lefts dont make a right... but three do) 3 five iron frenzy cds (cheeses, the end is near, the end is here) 1 michael w. smith cd (the second decade) 1 trans siberian orchestra cd (christmas eve and other stories) 2 audio adrenaline cds (some kind of zombie, worldwide) 2 newsboys cds (step up to the microphone, love liberty disco) 1 dc talk cd (jesus freak)  plus all the cds ive copyed from my bro and sis, but those don't count cause their only on my computer.  ive got like 328 songs on "angel" at the moment, but i have a lot more on my pc.  i've decided im not going to use the itunes music store anymore.  im just gonna buy the cds used on like amazon or something.  it's cheaper, plus i get the cd to rip at a higher quality in whatever format i want.  all in all, better in every way except the speed of aquiring it.  five minutes later.... my mom called me into the kitchen to watch some news thing about kids lifting weights, where they said kids just starting (me) need professional trainers (not dad).  then some thing came on saying that the third star wars movie will be called "revenge of the sith."  interesting.  i hope it isnt like "the phantom menace," which wasnt all that bad, but just doesnt compare to the first three. there's an interesting trend... "the empire strikes back"... "return of the jedi"... "revenge of the sith"... meanwhile, my sister and my mom are screaming at each other cause my sister is throwing a temper tantrum and doesnt want to go to lacrosse camp, and my mom is saying she's late. beautiful. lol oh well.  at least she's not yelling at me... but man my sister's voice can get shrill. the newsboys are a cool band.  ~stephen

      today has been ok... being a counseler at bdc is alright, but im not sure i can handle a week of rachel.  that little girl is insane.  she was eating her boogers, when they asked the group im leading if she loved god, she was like "no i hate him" just to get attention.  sheesh.  ok, rant over.  rachel's cool :p  i dont know why cameron cares so much about kids like climbing on me.  i guess he just doesnt want anything to go wrong, but still... rachel hurt herself more playing soccer this morning than she ever has playing with me.  i'm careful with the little ones.  meh.  i mowed the lawn when i got home, and i borrowed my sis's cd player to listen to my relient k cd.  it was a lot more fun then mowing the lawn has been before.  i keep waiting for va to send me an email but everytime i check and it says like "11 new emails", like 10 of em are spam and the other one is from my grandpa or something.  actually, that incident just happened today, but still.  she needs to email me back.  *hint hint*  i love my little mac.  i think im going to name it "angel" cause it's so pretty and white and awesome ;) plus i used it to get online in the creamery in PA on the penn state campus.  which was cool. speaking of PA, i need to finish the movie i started with my cousins.  they're depending on moi. ill get on that right now.  ~stephen

      it's 112º in vegas right now.  we got here this morning at about 11, and walked around the "vegas strip."  every few blocks there's a person handing out fliers just incase you want strippers delivered right to your door.  they have all the casinos and stuff.  dad did like a 25 cent slot machine once (and promptly lost).  i've been searching for internet access like all day, with no luck.  we were going to go to a water park, but in the parking lot, dad was getting his swimsuit out of the trunk and stepped on lauren's (already stubbed) toe.  now we get to see the hoover dam.  oh joy.  it's boiling in vegas.  i just want to jump in any large-sized body of liquid right now.  excluding septic tanks.   our rental car's windshield just cracked (for no apparent reason), and mom discovered someone's fingernails on the dashboard.  apparently they've been there since we got the car.  we drove through the "seedier" part of vegas, with adult movies, drugstores, and little wedding chapels rotating every few feet (not to mention the motels where you pay by the week).  the drives are the worst part of this vacation.  sitting in a car with a family that rarely stops bickering for hours on end, being constantly told to look at the views (the same as they were the last time you looked, thirty seconds ago), with no room to stretch and no way to sleep, and being called ungrateful, spoiled, self-centered, and who knows what else every time i ask a question or make a comment.  oh well.   this trip has really made me want to get a decent digital camera, but im afraid after the trip ill have nothing to photograph, and it'll be a waste of money.   we're going to see some free show in vegas tonight.  some pirate thing.  oh well.  perhaps i shall write more later tonight.  i still need a gift for ginny. peace  ~stephen

      today has been mildly interesting.  we woke up pretty early today (at like six o'clock) and danny got all upset.  he's still angry (arguing about sleeping in tomorrow).  we went and saw a bit more of the grand canyon.  actually, we saw a lot more of it.  then we drove.  and drove.  and drove.  for like 5 hours.  really boring...  then we went to zion national park and got some cool views.  we hiked for a few miles, and walked up this little stream/river thing.  pretty cool... then we ate dinner at this grill place and we got swarmed by bees.  no one got stung, but one landed on lauren.  it seemed like forever till the food got there... but danny said it was normal.  my dad messed around with the camera. danny and i talked to some lady who knows the area really well on one of the shuttle type things, and she recommended some hot springs near here.  we might do 'em tomorrow.  there's a pool and a hot tub at this hotel, and there were like two french families in there with us.  kind of interesting.  i took a shower and watched the simpsons, and i'm still trying to think of a gift for ginny's birthday.  coincidentally, i get home on her birthday.  the resteraunt we went to was in a lodge with complimentry internet access, but it was incredibly slow, so that didn't work out too well.  i cant wait till we get in a city with lots of wifi access points.  there's a network here i got onto, but it doesn't have internet access.  nuts. vegas is tomorrow!  woot. tchao  ~stephen

      well, the plane landed fine.  the pilot sang a little song over the intercom to wake everybody up.  arizona is pretty cool.  the rental car is a grand caravan, with bucket seats and that fancy stow and go storage thingi.  it was like 101º a bit ago.  pretty hot.  we've passed through "bloody basin," "horse thief road," and "dead man's gulch." we've also passed a "bad*** bbq" and "jack*** acres" or something.  pretty nasty area, eh?  while listening to a christian radio station.  thats a bit ironic... that reminds me.  i just found out about the christian radio station in virginia like a few months ago, and we found this one in like a few seconds.  i feel almost trapped right now.  i'm driving to the grand canyon, and i've been either driving or in a plane since like 4:30 this morning.  it's really irritating.  the jet lag is odd, too.  i was hungry for lunch at like ten in the morning ;), and i'll go to sleep at like 7 or 8 tonight :P it feels like the afternoon but it's just after noon. lol.  my sister is being a jerk.  she won't let me touch the video camera because she "called it."  my dad just said the newsboys  and relient k sound the same... i'm already not liking this vacation...  ~stephen

      im on the plane to arizona (well, pheonix.  i think that's arizona.).  i havent been on a plane since i was about five...  suprisingly, i'm not scared.  we've been in the air for a little less than an hour (four hour flight), and the take off was a bit scary.  haha right now im listening to "worldwide" by audio adrenaline.  "we're going worldwide!!!!" yeah, even last summer i was terrified of planes, but, as i told my parents, i've accepted my fate.  oh well. *melodramatic sigh*  i never realized planes were so loud... i can still here it droning on and on  through  my music at it's loudest.  crazy.  danny is sitting next to me sleeping, and lauren wants to watch a movie or something.  when i stood up to get my laptop out of my carry-on, i looked out the window and saw the ground waaaay below me and i was like "wow.... 33,000 feet sure is high..." i'm a little worried about the landing, not so much that we'll crash or something but that (now danny is sleeping on my shoulder) ill be "airsick" or something.  oh well.  hopefully i won't throw up on my laptop.  they're passing out complimentry orange juice and coffee.  i opted for orange juice.  the first time i had coffee (like two weeks ago), i sat down on my grandfather's couch, bumped my arm on an end table, and spilled it allll over me.  burning hot coffee is not pleasent.  now, to describe my fellow passengers ;) im sitting in the aisle seat in row 14.  to the upper left, there's some older/middle aged guy wearing a maryland terrapins hat who has been reading the entire plane ride.  i think he flies a lot.  in front of me, there are two people, both with laptops, working.  adults are boring.  to the right of them is some guy listening to music.  danny and lauren are to my right, and then there are two people in the row behind us.  i dont know much about them.  to my left, there are some people, my parents (a row behind us), and a row of girls (one sleeping, on who looks like she's airsick, and then another one).  yeah...  i think i get to see the grand canyon today.  i'm a little excited,  but im not getting my hopes up.  i want to be awed ;).  i have like five hours of battery life left, which is awesome.  totally.  i really could use an ipod, though.  not exactly unique, but awesome.    i think i'm going to read now.  i'm almost down reading "the bourne supremacy" for the second or third time, cause the movie wasn't great.  i'm pretty sure i've already written about that, though. by the way, no, there isn't internet access on the plane. i'm just typing these up.  and pasting/posting them later.   urlLink blogger  has a cool feature that lets you tell it what time you wrote it at, instead of selecting it automatically.  so whenever i get internet access i can just be like "i wrote it then, fool."  i'm running out of space, so i'll just leave this entry at that. later.  ~stephen  p.s.  did i just say i was running out of space?  i'm an idiot.  i've run out of things to say.
