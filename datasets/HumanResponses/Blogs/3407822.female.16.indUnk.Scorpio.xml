      hmmm... damn bored.. i feel a bit better now and my fever's gone down.. i guess its that puke-inducing rhino horn crap that my grandma made for me just now.. at least i'm coughing properly now instead of making those retarded constipated noises. it seriously sucks being sick during the holidays..   lets say i get well by tomorrow.. then i have 5 days of the holidays left to spasticate with my dear hobbits and school friends.. and they'll all probably go and watch harry potter without me then i'll have to watch it alone.. poor old me.. wallowing in my own self-pity.. sniffle..

      koff koff... wheeze.. sniffle.. i'm still sick. yesterday, i took my temperature like 10 times and it was all above 38.5 degrees. i haven't gone to see a doctor yet and i don't intend to. i think the medicine only makes me worse. really hope i get well before the bintan trip..  i'm starting to get worried for my terms. 2 out of my 8 days in singapore are gone already that means only 6 more days to study for 6 subjects.. and not like i'm going to study today.. good luck to myself..  damn bored at home.. i should go study.. but all my notes are incomplete so i'm borrowing from cindy to copy.. maybe then i'll start studying.. argh! i wanna go out!!

      i had to go to school today for entree from 8.00am to 12.00pm then for bintan cip trip preparations from 12.00 to 4.00pm. but i left early at about 1.20pm because i was feeling really sick and cold and every square inch of my body was aching. even my butt muscles were aching.. ok sorry too much info... could barely walk straight. then my grandmother made my mum scrape my back with a spoon and eucalyptus oil.. and sent me off to bed wrapped up in two blankets cos i was still feeling cold. hate being sick during the hols!   then my parents brought rachel and abby out to eat dinner but i had to stay at home and eat tasteless porridge. i doused the whole bowl with pork floss.. and bit into a stupid piece of ginger cos i thought it was potato. i guess i'll be going off to bed soon when my parents come back.. so i'm just stoning here eating pieces of pork floss that fell in the keyboard... pork floss is addictive..

      i got 1/15 for my F.Maths test. what else is new? i think i've only passed about 20% of tests this year.. and i failed my chinese oral for promos too! 9/20. the horrible wayne ng and his bunch of mean cronies from chinese class was distracting me by squishing their faces against the window while i was trying to have a proper conversation with the chinese teacher.. they're so mean right? what if i have to retain because i didn't pass my chinese? SOME people have serious moral issues to deal with!! actually i think i wouldn't have passed anyway.. sigh.. well.. there's always poly!  i just remembered something from the CHIJ diary said by sister anne:' if you fail to plan then you're planning to fail.' haha.. i think thats so retarded.. poor sister anne.. is she dead yet?   and then today margy was obsessing about xianrong's swimmers back. i think he's scared of her now... haha.. spiderman's one still nicer lah.

      i don't believe it.. i can't believe it.. ACJC lost.. actually i don't know shit about rugby so i really didn't know what was going on until the whole school suddenly went silent and RJC started screaming till their faces turned blue.. the score was 3-3. so near yet so far... yienli and melissa low came to watch the match too.. i missed them alot so i'm still in a good mood after the match even though we lost.. so coincidental because i saw vanessa low just yesterday at plaza singapura.   i tried to do my electrochemistry tutorial but i was too lazy.. well at least i tried...

      sigh.. lots of homework.. but its the last week of school already so i've got no mood to do any work at all. haha.. anyway the teachers can't come and chase me for my work during the hols because i won't be in singapore! so i think i'll just slack this week.. and suffer later. i went to watch shrek 2 with margy today. nice. pretty funny. worth my $6.50. and the puss in boots was soooo CUTE!! my two sisters who finished their exams already, almost everyday pon school for no reason. so they're going to watch shrek 2 tomorrow.   after the movie i went to meet phoebe because she was at plaza singapura spotlight waiting for my movie to finish so that she could give me a letter she wrote for me during her maths lecture(these cjc people ah.. so free right..). but i appreaciate it.. there's nothing like a letter from a best friend to make you feel happy!! i love you phoebs! muack!!     soooo cute right??!! i miss you maomao!!

      aaaaahh.... today was a good day. i went to yienli's house(supposedly to study) but we played in her neighbour's pool the whole day. before that we ate a really really good lunch-cooked by yien's mum. its been a long time since i had a good lunch(sorry mummy but your cooking HAS been pretty dull lately). and then while we were spasticating in the pool(and taking porn pictures of phoebe), the neighbour's maid came out and gave us freshly baked cinnamon rolls and lemon butter cake and banana fruit cake. mmm... they were soooo good!! sorry for stealing your cinnamon roll yien.. they say that a good meal can cheer someone up. i think its true. and i had 2 good meals! so i guess i'm quite happy. but now i feel fat...   then after that i went out with jacob and lisa to do market research for entree. i feel so bad for making them wait for me for 30 mins! sorry sorry sorry.. but first we went to eat mc donalds. (eating AGAIN! what's wrong with me!?) then we drifted aimlessly from over-priced t-shirt shop to over-priced t-shirt shop... until jacob decided that lisa and i should try turkish ice-cream... sigh.. i have nothing to say about that. then i came home, late as usual, but luckily my mum didn't ground me further. i'm already so grounded i could give ground black pepper a run for their money! ok lah.. not that bad.. at least i still get to meet my dear hobbits. and eat turkish ice-cream.. i still have nothing to say about that...  song stuck in my head: I like big butts an' I cannot lie. You otha brothas can't deny. That when a girl walks in wit' a itty bitty waist an' A round thing in yo' face. You get SPRUNG.  i think the reason why its stuck in my head is because my butt feels so huge right now after all that absolutely wonderfully scrumptiously deliciously delightful food... and turkish ice-cream... -_-

        ok. so here goes. the main reason why i decided to have a blog is because i have alot of things to say but no one to say them to. also because i'm struggling with the purpose of life. by no means does that mean i want to commit suicide! it just means that there's no meaning in my life. know what i mean? maybe by collating my confused and random musings i may analyze and decipher a reason behind my mundane existence.       here's a few things one should know about my blog: firstly, i don't expect anyone to read this so don't expect me come up with interesting and insightful interpretations of my everyday events. secondly, i'll tell you why i chose 'the sound of silence' as my blog title. skip this if you don't like long rambling explanations. i chose it because i feel that this short simple unassuming little phrase best describes me - unnoticed, unappreciated. many of you who know me personally will find this rather ironic. due to my inability to be NOT noticed in a crowd. however, like the taste of water and the smell of air, it is a rare few who see the real me, my heart, my thoughts, my idiosyncrasies, my little fustrations and can appreciate me for my simplicity.      kinda short isn't it? give me time..

      yaaaaay! fmaths and chem are OVER! only cmaths and physics left! and chinese but who cares about that.. in times of stress i always turn to the one thing that keeps me sane-LOTR!! (for 'o's it was harry potter) and chocolate of course. i have so much chocolate at home cos i bought some for kanti then he comes and tells me that he's allergic to chocolate. so sad. i feel so sorry for him. how can anyone survive without chocolate?

      tired. but happy. new zealand was great. i saw snow(and hail) for the first time in my life, i hit my sisters with snowballs on the slopes of mount doom, i stood on the front porch of bag-end, i drank pure water from straight from a waterfall,. the bad weather ruined most of our plans but it was still perfect. my parents didn't care that i wasn't studying and i ate as much hokey pokey ice-cream i could get my hands on, it was a dream i didn't want to wake from. total freedom.   BUT i'm back here in 28 degrees celcius singapore, with no waterfalls, no mountains, no horses, basically no clean, pure, fresh, natural, not genetically modified patch of grass where life thrives without the aid of pesticides or fertilisers. i love NZ. waaahhhh... the scenery. the people. everyhing. bah.

      i'm back from bintan! aaahhhhhh! i miss my bed, my toilet, my mum's cooking, my computer, my handphone, but most of all i miss my family and friends!! i made some new friends there and we've gotten quite close. i guess mutual suffering brings people together.   bintan was 'like that'. not good, not bad... the only bad part was that i didn't shit for five days cos the dorm we were living in only had squatting toilets!! oh and the food sucked!! no no no.. the worst part was that i gained 2 bloody kg on crap food!!! argh!! yeah.. lots of other things happened too but i don't feel like telling the whole world.. contact me for further bintan details.

      last night was the acjc choir concert! i went with yienli, annabelle and this guy called max(whom yien has a thing for..). i was almost late for it cos i took 166 and dropped a few stops too early then i had to rush down in a cab. then, i only had a $50 note in my pocket and the cab driver didn't have change! so yien had to come and pay for me.. heh.. *sheepish grin*  the concert was okaaay.. but too many of those ghostly, make-you-sleepy and chinesey kind of songs. the alumni choir was really good though.. then after that we forgot all about mel and just happily walked off to the mrt station.. i think yien must have been too absorbed in something else eh.. actually i wanted to go meet margy and gayle after the concert and say my goodbyes because i probably won't see them again until the terms start but my dad said 'come home!!' cos i was sick and had school the next day. i was kinda tired too i guess.. took a cab home.. dropped yien and gang at the busstop outside her house..  dragged myself to school this morning.. for bintan trip preparations AGAIN.. i was still feeling sick and crappy but i had to go cos i didn't go for so many already and i felt bad for leaving cindy there to do all the work.. so for two hours or so we sat in the 1AD1 classroom pasting stuff and talking which soon progressed to bitching.. haha.. bonding with my fellow volunteers.. hmmm.. then after that me and cindy had to go and see that gay geog teacher with the screwed-up eyes about our lesson plan. but we finally managed to get it approved and he even gave us $20 to buy teaching materials.. so we went to the mama shop in holland v to buy those small plastic animals.. so the little children can play nicely with them while we slack around putting tiger balm on our mosquito bites..   after that went to meet feebs at orchard.. but before that.. i saw jean p. on the bus!!! yay!! i miss her lots! then i found out from her that she's living very near to someone i know!! and so is daphne chui!!  me and feeb went to eat at marche. i tried this health juice thingy which was supposed to detoxify my body but it just tasted like crap.. waste my money only.. then just as we were leaving marche to go and do some shopping(not just window shopping mind you.. REAL shopping. cos for the first time since cny i actually have money to spend) my phone started ringing. it was 'home' calling. out of decent courtesy i picked up. the voice on the other end said:'hello? bert?' so there i was wondering who the hell calls me 'bert' without getting badly bruised around the general face area first.. then i remembered! i was supposed to give my cousin, mark, tuition at 2.30pm and it was already 2.30++!!! so no choice lah.. had to rush home.. then i was cranky for the rest of the day cos my real shopping outing with phoebe was ruined and because i was reminded of the fact that there's still somebody in this cruel world that still calls me 'bert' and doesn't have a badly bruised face..   eh... its vesak day tmr! public holiday! why isn't anyone free?! i wanna go out!!

      i ponned chinese todaaay!! to continue playing badminton with harsha, kenneth, and reaksmey after PE. they're damn pro!! so i had a really good workout! i actually decided to go for the second period of chinese but then i met gayle and sarah in the void deck making silme. so me and sarah ponned chinese together.. haha.. we felt quite guilty cos it was the first time ponning lessons but i think i would do that again anytime! so fun!  after school, i called yien cos i didn't want to go home yet and she was meeting jean and mari!! then as i was walking out of school to take a bus to town, mel was waiting outside for her mum! so her mum gave us a lift to scott's. and then after browsing for a while for mel's semi-formal dress, phoebe came!! with max. so it was a complete hobbit reunion!! yay!! but then i had to leave cos my dad said i have to be home by 8. party pooper..

      hmm... i realised my postings have become more and more irregular.. i have so many tutorials to do but i keep going online and the next day i still have nothing done.. i must try to work harder.   actually many exciting things happened since my last posting. here is a very brief overview:  sunday- my first flight in the piperIIwarrior, it was DAMN fun!! but i&nbsp;&nbsp;kinda screwed up.  monday- went shopping with margy, she bought a nice skirt and matching top from topshop, i&nbsp;think i want that top too.  tuesday- lifeguard training made my butt really sore, there's a blue-black there now, i cant sit comfortably in a chair. and my bag keeps bumping on the same spot when i walk, changing bag tomorrow.  wednesday-which is today, i went for the maths quiz, though i really really&nbsp;wanted to go for the track and field finals. but dunno how to get there myself and didnt have anyone to go with me. but the maths quiz was suprisingly fun and i got into the final round(obviously by default lah cos so few people turned up). actually jacob was the only SA1-er who didnt get into the finals. then he got pissed with me for telling dhinesh that. PMS(petty man syndrome). my team didnt win.

      these past few days i've been sleeping quite late. on thursday night&nbsp;i had to stay up till&nbsp;  1am   faking PW minutes. being sercretary sucks big time!!!&nbsp;i wouldn't mind if i&nbsp;had a hot boss and was paid inordinate sums of money to sit behind a polished desk all day and file my professionally manicured nails&nbsp;BUT... in my case its almost the exact opposite... i had to sit on the metal chair all night cos the soft chair was in my parents room AND my PW group leader is tran quang thach.. and well.. you know..   on friday, my mum bought me a telescope!! i spent the whole night fixing it up until   12am  . but how sad, there ain't any cute/hot guys near my house.. okay.. thats not the point! thanks mummy for buying me the telescope so that i may look at the&nbsp;STARS only...   and tonight i'll have to sleep late again&nbsp;because tomorrow...... wait for it..... i'm going on my first flight in the Piper II Warrior PA-28-161!!!!!&nbsp;YAY!! and i have to memorise all the aircrart checks so the instructor will be impressed.   today i went to eat prata at jalan kayu with some youth flying club people- sameera, mingen, zardson, christopher and yuan qing(i think).&nbsp;quite fun. the prata was disappointing though.   this week was a good week.   &nbsp;

      this week has been relatively eventful. on monday, i did something REALLY bad. but now that i look back on it, its not THAT bad lah..  &nbsp;  on tuesday, the stupid lifeguard coach and the stupid lifeguard teacher-in-charge(i dunno her name) were seriously pissing me off. the stupid money-faced&nbsp;coach came and told us that he wanted to quit because the teacher-in-charge was irresponsible and didn't pay him his money. then after that he went to tell the teacher-in-charge that he wanted to quit because of our attitude. WTH!! we were forced to apologise to that&nbsp;insufferable bag of shit and beg him to stay!!!! wa liao!! can't stand it!!  &nbsp;  on wednesday.. oh i went to watch mean girls with my mum and sisters. some parts were quite funny but i didnt really enjoy it. probably because i wanted to watch it with phoebe then we could have fun acting all bitchy and bimbotic after that. bah.  &nbsp;  thursday,&nbsp;we were all changed and ready to give 110% for lifeguard then the stupid coach called last minute to say he couldn't come because he was sick. WTH!! he is seriously pissing me off man!! if i see him alone in a dark alley one day i'll beat him up so bad he's gonna have to stuff his fat ass into a wheelchair everyday for the rest of his bloody life!  &nbsp;  friday, nothing much happened. my term exams results are: chem-F, physics-F, fmaths-F, cmaths-A, chinese-C, gp-B. i'm quite okay with it because&nbsp;i know i didn't study at all. mugged for the aircraft systems, radio-telephony, airlaw exam. and i coloured the picture of the piper II warrior PA-28-161 avco-lycoimg engine really nicely! yay! so pretty!  &nbsp;  saturday was youth flying club parents day. in the morning i had&nbsp;the exam(mcq, thank god!) then a break before the saftey lecture. during the break i decided to go talk to the only other person in course129 from acjc- churn pang, instead of sticking to the 3 other girls like some anti-social loser. his christian name is ferris but he's not christian. i talked to him for the whole break and i had to do most of the talking. had to initiate the exchange of phone numbers and email. i don't like doing that. but he's a nice guy. likes lotr. okay-looking. taller than me. looks rich... hmmm... ANYWAY, i made new friends and i'm starting real flying next week!! excited!! i'm aiming to be the first&nbsp;to complete first&nbsp;solo then i get a free nav flight to tioman!! but the competition is pretty stiff. i'll have to work hard!!  &nbsp;  sunday, was my mum's birthday lunch which she cooked herself with lots of help from me and nanny. only aunty mag, uncle jeffery, godma(the fake one), varian and mark came to eat. i forced mark to come over for tuition early so i could go out with phoebe at 3 but we didnt&nbsp;go out in the end cos it was quite rude to just leave when we had guests over. varian looks fatter but he says its muscle. and i think i'm taller than him now. he says to look out for him training in seletar camp when i'm flying over in my piper II warrior. aunty mag told me that napolean(her persian cat) died. cos he was quite old. poor nappy. he was cute. but maomao was cuter.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      my life has been quite boring so far resulting in the lack of regular updates. nothing of great significance has befell me since Tuesday, July 06, 2004. well, actually there was that one thing, and the other thing. however, after much thought and reflection, i have come to the conclusion that i tend to exagerrate trivial, unimportant issues, therefore a seemingly momentous moment in my lugubrious life is in fact an ordinary occurence. hence, i have not written about them in my blog to spare all you poor souls from the dull monotony of the lifeless life of liz.

      suppose i said  i am on my best behavior and there are times i lose my worried mind?  would you want me when i'm not myself? wait it out while i am someone else?  suppose i said  colours change for no good reason  and words will go  from poetry to prose  would you want me when i'm not myself? wait it out while i am someone else?  and i, in time, will come around i always do for you  suppose i said  you're my saving grace  john mayer-room for squares   i learnt an invaluable lesson today. instead of wallowing in my own self pity like i usually do when i'm feeling crummy, i put it behind me for the time being and carried out my business as usual. and i feel better for it.  i just need some time alone to think this out.  i'll get over it. soon.

      i'm kinda sad. yeah. i never thought my self-esteem could get any lower. but it just did. i'll just go to school tomorrow as per normal, pretending that my life is not crumbling beneath my feet, pretending that my eyes are not red and puffy, pretending that i'm the same old happy and carefree lizzie. when in fact i'll never be the same again.  to friends: i'll get over it. don't ask. phoebe: thanks. you mean alot to me. thanks again.

      today i had to wake up at 8.50am to walk steve in. from then onwards until 4.00pm i did nothing but stupid PW. then my dad sent me to yanxun's house for the barbeque. it wasn't very fun, considering the amount of grovelling i had to do before my mum would let me go. almost everyone left at 8.30pm. and the guys were talking their guy talk the whole time leaving me and margy to rot by the sides. guys are shallow. the satay was good though. everyone's staying up to watch the match. should i? nah.. i only watch world cups. and besides steve is coming AGAIN. i hope we can finish before lunch time then i can go out with phoebe! to watch spiderman's back and shoulders!! and i found out something today that is devastating. i'll tell you tomorrow phoebs(only).

      screwed up physics. i mean ..like ..duh! but i only left 13 marks worth of questions blank so i'm quite proud of myself on account that i didn't study at all. i saw chin fang today!! she's still as cute as before!! made cookies at yien's house and watched her model clothes for her mum's designer friend. and then i decided to go with them to chijmes but i didn't have any clothes so after trying on countless grossly tight and un-liz outfits and totally messing up yien's room(sorry yien!!) i wore some hippie clothes cos i had a hippie bag and bracelet to match.(didn't go to chijmes in the end) steve is coming over tomorrow.. i mean today.. at 9.30am!! so i guess i better go to sleep now.

      something's wrong with me. no one loves poor old sad and depressed lizzie. i think even maomao doesn't love me anymore. oh well.. i guess i just have to live with it because nothing can or will make me feel better. i went swimming today because i was feeling restless and just needed to get out of the house.. after that i ate i bit of chocolate which cheered me up a little..(small yay)

      tomorrow is the last 24 school-free hours of the very well-recieved national day break. however, being the stupid, imbecilic, half-baked chap i am, i gleefully made an extra booking for my 4th sortie(it means flight in layman terms). and now, i'm up to the upper decks of my neck in checks- initial checks, external checks, strapping in procedures, pre-start checks, starting the engine, after start checks, leaving dispersal checks and so on..  regret? no. by some sadist gene(which believe me,  does  run in the family), i am enjoying the stress, relishing in the knowledge that i  will  suffer for my impulsive, irrational decisions and that i wont be smiling when retribution comes a-knocking. if anyone says they're behind me in tutorials, i have two words for you- you're wrong.     i want to be myself but the temptation of acceptance is too alluring...

       If there is one person you can't stop thinking about, post this same exact sentence in your journal.  hmm do cats count? hahaa.. i guess i am thinking about other people too lah. haha.. like gandalf and dumbledore.. hee hee.. haiya.. other real people too lah..  i bought some nice books from kinokuniya today. yay! i think they should be able to last me the rest of the year. thanks feeb for coming with me.. i could see you were totally bored to death.. i hope the half of oreo cheesecake made up for it!  random: youth flying club is really taking up so much time. but its fun. i'm jealous of thin and pretty people. i appreaciate phoebe. going online is a total waste of time. but i think i'm addicted. some people are irritating. some people are nice. some people are freaky. some people induce jealous-ness. most people like to be appreciated. most people dont appreciate. i cant find things when i need them. i have no self-control. i have no discipline. i am obsessed. which may be a good thing in certain cases. but is a bad thing in most. i accept the world for what it is.

      it seems like i spend so much time in school and for travelling. i'm not spending enough time at home.  my second and third sorties were very eventful and memorable!! but i wont write about them here because you people will get bored with all the technical jargon.  this week was a good week. no particular reason, just that it was better than others. actually i think i'm enjoying myself more nowadays. the first few months in AC i was kinda depressed and anti-social. but i've learnt that the best thing to do is get over stuff you know you cant do anything about and move on. and i'm a happy person now!! yay!!  anyway, i found out that my parents are reading this blog. so i'm reluctant to write more in case they take it the wrong way... again... daddy mummy please dont read- you're invading my privacy and restricting my freedom of speech..
