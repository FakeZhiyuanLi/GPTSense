      So this is my first time as a blogger... haven't written in a very long time... i used to write ALL the time... i had 5 journals to my name that said everything and anything... UNTIL someone tore into my thoughts and diminished the whole concept of privacy....*sigh... some people just don't have any respect.... anyway...so why blog? i want to be heard.... and i want people to know me... and the best way is just to read everything that runs through my mind.... flat out plain and simple.... no beating around the bush... no saying what people want to hear...just me....

      hey... it's about 1038pm...don't think i've ever written this late before... i'm usually at work when i have a blogspot to post... i'm at rich's right now...handling our business... me handling taking care of the bills and him doing the laundry... dude...i picked up a good man huh? hehehe... anyway... my mood right now...just kinda mellow i guess...not goofy...not excited...not irate... just mellow.... you know just one of those days where you don't want to say anything... where you just want things to flow to the end of the day.... not wanting to do much yet not wanting to do too little either yeah know?   i miss my grandparents...i haven't seen them in over a month now.... gawd i hate that i neglect them.  At one point I tried to make the effort to see them at least once a week...have dinner... talk to them... just to remind them that they haven't been forgotten.  They get so butt hurt when I don't keep in touch... and I don't blame them for that.... but it seems like they give me, brother, and my sister extra attention, they worry more about us... and I know it's cuz we don't have my mom and dad to worry about us.... so they kinda try to take over that.... but I want to reassure them that we are okay... that we're growing up and living our lives... but not that we've forgotten them.... so why can't I just go see them once a week...or even once every two weeks... why is that so hard? well..... I've been busy...... but still............. that's not an excuse.....   my grandpa just recently got diagnosed with lymphona (sp?).... some type of cancer in the lymph nodes.... at first they thought it was his kidneys.... and actually they've already partially failed... but they've discovered a lump in his lymph nodes.... so now he's been doing chemotherapy.... everytime i see him i see his weight fluctuate.... where he's so thin that his skin hangs low....then I'll see him again and his face is all swollen..... but he always seems to have a smile on his face... he's the more understanding one of the two... he knows that i have things to take care of.... working... living my life....etc.... he's always so happy to see us when we go over there.... we talk about stuff.... i hold his hand.... we make jokes... my brother tries to wrestle him.... being gentle of course.... but i see it in his eyes that he worries....i see it in his eyes that the family hasn't been the same ever since my parents passed.... but he's strong... and doesn't let those things get to him.....he's always been supportive with everything that I've done in my life.... never ever looked down on me... even when I did make mistakes.... he'd talk to me about it... then kiss me and say, "anak... you know i love you...and I'll always be here for you"  my grandma on the other hand...gives us mad guilt trips.... always says things like, "you forgot us already?".... hahahah... she's this chubby short woman (shorter than me even!) with a thick accent and can barely hear... she can barely speak english... so i have to speak loud and fobby to her so she understands.... i guess english sounds more clear to her when it has a filipino accent tied to it.... she cried every time she'd see us.... she starts wiping her eyes and says, "i can remember your mommy and daddy".... and my brother and I tell her, "grandma! stop crying! we're here! be happy for us!".... and my brother will pick her up...and she'll start laughing..... i always made sure to call grams before we came by to start cooking..... anything she cooked we love..... i remember when i was young... i envied all my friends because their freezer was stuffed with microwaveable foods.... oh man... used to crave for the chicken nuggets...the burritos...the pizzas.... all we ever got was filipino dish after filipino dish...loaded with vegetables....ampalia...bamboo shoot....okra....eggplant...squash... DUDE! but now i so crave for those dishes.... so my grandma would cook like 5 dishes... and she'd start yapping at us if we'd only had 2 servings....hhahahah... she was great... always laughing.....always smiling....always so happy to see us....   i'm seeing them tomorrow.... i need to call my grams tomorrow to cook well! hehehehe....

      hellooooooo! it's tuesday... the beginning of the work week for me... why today and not monday you ask? cuz i didn't go to work yesterday! woo hoo! woke up at 7... went to the bathroom and looked at myself... decided i was lazy today and went back to bed.... how cool is that? slept till about 10 cuz Brit called... checked my email and friendster of course... uploaded pics from mikey's bday.....cleaned the house... replaced the plugin in the living room (aaah...smells sooo ggoooddd!), dusted, vaccuumed, organized my closet... (i'm a neat freak..not totally anal... but i like my place being clean or else my mind won't function properly)....got ready, picked up brit and had lunch with rich at nation's burgers.... man.... i ate a giant cheeseburger and chili cheese fries... talk about baboy! dude... AND i didn't go caca after that... brit and I persuaded rich to cut the rest of his work day so he did...and knowing him...it didn't take much to convince him... so we went home and took almost a 2 hour nap.... dude... after sleeping in you'd think i wouldn't be tired right? man... i was tired... anyway... got up and noticed that rich was asleep and so was my brother...but brit was awake watching TV.....oh man felt so bad that we fell asleep on her... talk about bad hosts! she looked at me and was like, "finally!"... so i woke rich up and we went swimming...my laps back and forth makes up for my cardio at the gym..... then rich cooked dinner while i replaced pictures in the frames around the house with new ones.... had dinner and did #3 of my bad habits... couldn't breathe for a good 2 hours...hahahha... food was too good!.... anyway after that.... watched adaptation... dude crazy movie...but all in all was really good.... i had a great day wouldn't you think? not lazy or bored around the house.... just productive and relaxing...   The weekend was great! went camping... and there was a total of 17 of us... had a great time... even though it was freaking HOT as heck it was really cool..totally relaxing.... played mafia at night for like 3 hours all drunk.. volleyball during the day... and when it was TOO hot to do anything... we played charades... and told stories of how the couples met... the majority of everyone there were couples.... had LOADS of food... like HELLA food....but I really had a great time and I'm glad that Rich was able to go and get to know my other friends... and I know that Rich had a great time too.... my brother too... even if he was the youngest...him being 16 and the next youngest 21.... i love that my brother is so social and doesn't feel intimidated by anyone older than him... i haven't posted the camping pics on ofoto yet.. but i think i will tonight....   anyway...got back sunday around 1230pm... took a shower cuz i was filthy! my feet black and my body sticky...oh man...nu-AASTY! hahhahaha... got ready and went to the reUNEion thing at Kennedy park... stayed there for about an hour and left.. the turn out wasn't too great but it was cool seeing some old faces.... went to play volleyball in san mateo... only not too many people showed up so we kinda just messed around and talked about hair... hahahaha...then had dinner at Pho with brit, chris, and rich..then rented videos: Story of David Gale and Adaptation....  DUDE... Story of David Gale is hella trippy... totally freaked me out how things came to be... so... kevin spacey was the leader of an anti-capital punishment activist group and is charged of rape and murder and is about to get executed in 4 days... and he chooses Kate Winslet to come interview him and have her investigate the crime because he believes that he's been framed... anyway...    BEFORE YOU GO ON   - if you don't want to know how the movie turns out  ...DO NOT READ ON ...   the lady that was murdered was his bestfriend/sidekick also a supremist against criminal execution....anyway.... don't want to get too much into it... but at the end when kate finally finds out that that Kevin is truly innocent.. she is like 3 minutes late of Kevin's execution... all that searching for nothing right? an innocent person executed...... BUT!!!.........the truth: his best friend that was murdered actually planned the whole thing out and committed suicide!!!.... so why frame kevin? kevin has always been 100% supportive of her..... well guess what... kevin was in on it too.... they did this to prove that innocent people do get charged wrongly therefore proving that criminal execution is unjust.... PSYCHO huh? dude great movie to watch... really.. got me trippen out.... anyway... had to tell you about that one....   well got to get back to work....   by the way - i'll be posting my movie/rental favorites in the side bar for your information... can you tell i love movies? yeah!

        beautiful! wonderful! oooooo la la!!!    i'd like to thank myself for taking the time and effort to figuring out the template codes  .... dude.... some of the html codes i just can't seem to get! figured out how to do colors...how to align... fonts even... but still the whole format...the way it's laid out is confusing! i suggest  NOT  to try to edit html coding after a night of binge drinking....just doesn't work... and my eyes are blurry...but i am happy with what i've done... i'm hoping to add a chatter box or a tag board like char's and cici's.... but i need to make another column on my site...align it to the right like char's.... but i don't even know if it'll allow me to do that... well whatever....   oh yeah... i put up shopping links! woo hoo! those stores are my preferences for online shopping...   ADVICE OF THE DAY:  you can get better deals shopping online... they give you internet rates...and don't worry about the shipping and handling.... you're more than likely to run into some promo deal of free shipping and handling or discounts...or something....PLUS there's a better chance of you finding your size!   *sigh...i want to shop...i soo want to shop... just haven't had the time... don't have time to shop? geez! i must really be going through something ...and i'm trying SOO hard to be good with my money.....*sigh.. *sigh...*sigh... but but...I LOVE SHOPPING?!@#$!

      my bad habits:  1) not getting up in the morning 2) being late 3) eating with my eyes  i'm going through #3... frick... had mcdonald's for lunch...bought a 6 peice meal and a cheeseburger.... dude... i was full at half a burger and 3 nuggets.... so why do i continue eating? geez.....i'm at my desk lazy and sleepy as hell cuz i ate too much!!!!!!!! i would go caca to relieve myself.... but instead mcd is sitting in my stomach and turning into fat to be distributed else where than my intestines! AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!! but it's okay...cuz i have lost weight... you can see it in my belly.... really you can................... hahahhaha...  i'm watching Road to Perdition little by little for the last couple of days... i left off where Michael Sullivan (Tom Hank) and his son Mike Jr. went to visit some dude in Chicago to ask to have their back when he goes back to kill John Runne's son (the dude that kills Mike's wife and son)....anyway the Chicago guy says no...and now their off to Perdition... where his wife's sister lives.... OOoOooOooohhHhhhh... so sad.... i was on my way to work this morning and i was thinking about the movie... and thinking about the son and how he lost his mom and his brother... all he has left is his dad... and it's so sad.... cuz even though i don't have my parents in my life anymore... i'm still really happy cuz i have my brother and sister still with me... i kinda have an idea that Tom may possibly die at the end.... and his son will then have no one.... he'd be alone... now that is really sad..........  what's happened to me in my life definitely is a trajic story... and people would think that i need to be treated differently or sensitively ...but to be honest... i mean in my own perspective... I don't think my scenario has been the worst that I've heard....don't get me wrong cuz what happened to my brother, sister, and I does hold serious weight in our lives.......but......anyway...getting to my point......well i really don't have a point...just a random thought...what i went through in my life happened one day in my life.... and i've learned to move on and grow from it... but there are so many people in this world who is actually living a life of endless trajic stories.... and those people who are still able to hold their heads up high and still have hope that one day their lives will become better.... i really really have to admire... because although life can be a very wonderful thing... at the same time...it's the hardest thing that you can go through......and I'm really blessed to have a life that i'm living right now....  woo hoo! it's the end of the work day! time to golf! FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFOOOOOOOOOORRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!

Me, Riz, Joy, Mookie, Nenette, and Mel... Mel? who's mel? She's one of Rich's close friends... who i've gotten to know just recently... i thought it would a great idea to have her kick it with the girls.... she's so easy going and fun to be with...i just knew that my girls would appreciate that.... anyhow.... as i was saying...the night was tight... we had dinner at Applebee's.... all of us gossiping and catching up on whatever we've missed out on.... then we went to Friday's... same ish...but louder since we've all had our fair share of drinks....oh by the way...i have PICTURES! haven't had the chance to put them on ofoto...but i will soon enough... anyway... i love my girls.... i really do... i'm so happy to have them in my life.... they keep me sane and healthy.... i don't feel like i can miss out on anything or feel misunderstood with them here with me....i mean sure we don't hang out as often as before... but it's okay.... and to be honest...i don't think i can hang like i used to... but when we do get together...it's like no time has been missed and we learn to love and appreciate one another even more.... and i'm really glad that mel came along...she's going through a rough, confusing time in her life and I'm glad that my girls and I can be there for her.... not necessarily to give her advice.... but to give her the assurance and the support that everything will be okay....i mean one of the reasons why i own my confidence and strength is because of my girlfriends.... and i know this bonding girl time will help her sort her thoughts.....so this thursday.... i think we're hitting up San Jose Bar & Grill.... new scenery... new vibe...different food.... can't wait!

      my pictures are up from Tahoe this weekend... did i get to tell you about it.... well it was FABULOUS! my brother came too and he had a great time... he met a new friend too.... so cute... hehhee...if you see the pictures....you notice he's always taking a picture with someone.. hehehehe...   anyhow...it's wednesday...the hump of the week...and my week has been busy.... well not really... i guess it seems busy because i barely have time to do anything..... like i come home from work..and in about 3 hours or so it's time to go to bed... sucks! can't wait to start going to work part time... but that means going to school full time...full days.... from 9am - 9pm.... *sigh... well just like noted in my last blog.... you deserve everything you've worked for... so i know that in the future...after all the hard work...i'll be rewarded... hehhehehe....  by the way, have you ever loved someone so much that it made you cry? not tears of pain.........but tears of happiness? It could happen....it could definitely happen.......

       DESERVING THE BEST     $RICH$...but I'm broke...  here's what makes my life valuable in reality...if you deserve something, it's your own responsibility to make sure you get what you deserve... so i know what i deserve in life....now i'm in the mode to go out and get them. i'm living my life the way i believe i deserve to...i'm trying to put in the work and effort it takes to get what i deserve....not be so passive, but get aggressive and pursue the things that make life worth living   I definitely agree.... Rich wrote me a blog statement this morning via Yahoo mail... so I decided to post a part of it because it means so much.  I'm proud of who I am, I think through all that I have, all that I know, all that I've seen and done, I have lived a successful life.  I say that because my life at this very moment is at its best... and that's what I deserve.  I haven't finished school yet, I haven't traveled as much as I'd hope, my credit isn't as good as I'd want it to be.....yet I say that my life is at its best because I'm surrounded by confidence, motivation, and focus. And eventually I'll reach my goals and ambitions.... and to know that makes me feel at my best...... and simply: HAPPY  From my Friendster profile: on the serious tip...I definitely have to say that after everything that life has put me through...the worst and the best...I have come to look at life as a priveledge...even when you have those bitchen a$$ days where nothing seems to be going right...when those days are over...you come to a realization that you're that much stronger and that much wiser than before that day has even begun. Your worth is everything you make it to be...I know my worth and i won't settle for anything less.... so the challenge is here...you either live your life regretting mistakes done, bitch to everyone about how everything in your life is all messed up,  OR  move on by living productively, confidently and sucessfully...

      okay...so things aren't going my way today... i'm not pissed off or anything... but it just sucks........   1) Got pulled over this morning.... going 52 in a 35 zone.... YIKES! .... but I guess that's why I'm not mad about the situation...cuz it is my fault...woke up late.... and was in a hurry to get to work... but i could've gotten up early today cuz Rich was practically yanking my lazy butt out of bed..... oh well...it's been over a year and a half since my last one so i'll just take traffic school to clear it up....  2)Okay... so Rich, Edsel, Jeremey, myself and some other folks were planning to hike up Half Dome in Yosemite... and there were a whole bunch of other people on top of that who were suppose to go just to camp for the weekend right...... so Monday... i check this site which tells you the campsite availabilities at Yosemite for the next several months.... and August is fairly empty..... so Rich and I send out an evite to all those who want to go.... but to get back to us by Friday so that we can guarantee a site already..... but guess what...Rich checked the site today and August is full.... AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! and I called to check just to make sure.... and NOTHING is available the weekend we want to go!!!!!! SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and i was totally looking forward to hiking half dome!!!!!!!   yeah...that's my day so far.... and it's only 10:35am.... sheesh...

       Happy belated 4rth of July!!!!!!!!  Can you believe that school will be starting again in just over a month? Time hella flies the older you get...before you know it... MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! hahahha...  my weekend was  FABULOUS!  Rich and I spent the 4rth with his dear friends... who are my friends now too (hehehhehe).... swimming, eating, playing pingo-pong, singing karaoke, getting mad drunk, and dominating the dangerous white waters of cache creek!! (okay... so the waters weren't that dangerous.... but Jeremy's rodeo riding a$$ sure made it one bumpy ride!!!)  I made a lot of new friends this weekend.....and it totally reflects what kind of guy Rich really is..... it's totally true that you can tell what type of person someone is just by seeing who they hang out with.... Rich has such a great and genuine ora that surrounds his life day to day... no wonder he is so wonderful....   I've come to learn that in order to get to where you want... you have to surround yourself with things that can help you get there.... no distractions no drama... just affection, motivation, success, genuineness (is that even a word?..oh well...) ... i also believe that no one can ever tell you different but yourself... but how must easier will it be if you don't ever have to take the effort to avoid distractions....just don't head in the direction of having to avoid anything....just cruise on forward...  I'm 22... and I need the motivation and I need the focus.... I am determined.... but things happen in life that unfortunately side track you.... I want to finish my school so badly that I'm scared that I may fail.... I'm scared that I won't be able to.... don't get me wrong...i have the confidence in myself that i will succeed and finish.... but there's always this "what if" in the back of my mind that just keeps me at the edge of my seat...... but you know what? that "what if" in the back of my mind has been quiet lately.... and I think it has a lot to do with Rich.... yeah on the outside he's this dorky goofball.... but inside.... his heart is wholesome and his intelligence admirable.... I've always been the one to have to take care of other people... to look out for other people.... people would come to me for all the questions and answers..... i had to be the strong one in the relationship to make things work.......... but not with rich.... he's my partner at everything..... speaking for me when I am speechless.... removing items from my plate when i couldn't hold it....when I am fragile and weak..... he makes me strong.... and he tells me the truth..... even when it's criticism..... he makes me suck it up and take it........ cuz i know he has the best interest at heart............ he not only wants to be part of my life...but he wants me to be part of his....and with him i'm capable to do anything..... he says that he loves that i'm so "gung-ho".... and you know what? i love it too..... even when i'm irritated... at my wits end.......... for some reason or other..... my heart and my mind can clear up the frustration and know that i deserve him in my life..... he makes me better.... and because of him....my life is better.....................  He is my hamachi in my sushi..............and i LLLLOOOOOOOOOOOVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEE hamachi!!!!!!!!!!

      "How Rude!" said Stephanie as DJ and Kimmy left her to go to the mall.......  famous quote from young Stephanie Tanner on Full House.... hey.... what happened to that show anyway....just like FRIENDS.... i could watch rerun after rerun without EVER getting bored of the show.... I used to think DJ was hella cool and I totally wanted to be like her...hair, clothes and all..... HAHHAHA.....one of my favorite episodes was when Becky and Uncle Jessie got married.... and he sang to her that song on his new album............*Sigh........... so sweet!!!!!!!! didn't know the words to the song except this one line.........man! forgot! but i can picture his video..... candles everywhere and he's taking a bubble bath with his twin sons.....remember them? Alex and......what was the other? shoooot.... oh welll....   there was a point to that quote.... i'm trying to retrieve information for someone here at work...and i do...and while in the middle of my explanation... middle of a sentence even... he says that's all i need to know...and walks out............MAN!!!!!! people are just sooo rude! uuurrrkkkkiiinngg!

      I have a boyfriend.  His name is Richard.  We've been seeing each other for about 2 months already.... and he's beautiful.  Inside and out. He overly emphasizes the word appreciation....I've never had someone who made me feel so on top of the world....from the very getgo.... even when we were just friends... our level of relation was amazing... no effort...all reciprocation... that's what we're all about..................................................................................... we both have been in long term relationships... talk about more than 5 years.... and you'd think that I'd be some expert on all new relationships to come... been through this been through that....but sometimes i need to just knock myself in the head and remind myelf that I don't know everything... that things aren't always going to be bliss...........so i ask myself....... so is it worth it? yes.....................it's definitely worth it........cuz at the end...i know that everything will be okay................

       Appreciate: 1.  To recognize the quality or magnitude of. 2. To be fully aware of. 3. To be thankful for  You'd be surpise how easy it can be to forget to say thank you.......or to not notice someone's extra effort..... "Thank you" or "you're doing a great job" goes a very very LOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNGGGGGGGGG way..... and it's sad to see how many people in the world don't get recognized for all their rightful doings... why is it you notice the wrong things more about someone than the right ones? Not appreciating decreases one's motivation to strive...  to progress upward.... we all get caught up using the word "I" that the little things that do count...  just does not matter.....so what can i do to make someone realize that they are appreciated for all that they do even if someone else thinks different? How can I express my words of gratitude so that those words of discouragement doesn't exist?

      my eyes are so screwy right now....i really need to go see an optometrist (sp?).....blurrrryyy viissssiiiooonn.... so it's 226pm...i had lunch with an excoworker of mine today.... he's 34 and his wife is pregnant with their first child.  Congratulations Mukund! He's such a good guy...I'm totally happy for him! Anyway.... he gets into asking about why I left Aarohi (cuz I never really explained to him the real deal).... and it's because I want to go back to school full time.  So I'll be starting in the Fall full-time...and my current job is guaranteeing me more money plus a part time position when the time comes.....great oppurtunity for me! And he's happy to hear that I'm doing this....setting my goals and conquering it.... he's also telling me to remain focus.... to not have to worry about the other things.... like i was telling him that I wanted to travel...and he's like, "well you need stability to do that first"...and I thought...very true.... i can't go travelling and experiencing the world without a penny to my name... that's just nonsense..... so he tells me to estalish myself first and then I'll be able to do what I want to do.... right now it's what i "need" to do before I can do what i "want" to do....makes sense? well, no matter how long and tedious my days will get...i need to remain focus....i mean i have to admit i'm definitely more motivated now to go to school than i was right after high school.... then again...if i just continued on after high school i would've been done by now....but then again...my situation is differerent....so it's been justified....well whatever the case may be...i have the confidence in myself that i will get done in a couple years or so...establish my life....and then be able to do everything i "want" to do.....

      A new day.... haven't really gotten the hang of blogger yet... but not trippen about it too much cuz my main focus is to write. Went bowling last night at Cloverleaf...it used to be our Monday thing to do... but since we moved out and away from each other...it hasn't been the case.... "we" referring to Antoinette and I.  She's my best friend.  I've known her since 3rd grade....we've been through ups and downs.... but bottom line...she's probably one of the most stubborn people I know...but I love her and I'd do anything for her.... I've came and gone through so many friendships in my life... I'm fortunate enough to still keep in touch with many... but through the years only the ones that really count stick around.  Two girlfriends in my life that I know i can count on till death do us part....Marisue and Antoinette..... it's always us 3....it's been this way for the past 3 years already....i know 3 years isn't a very long time...but it's genuine and as pure as it can get. Funny cuz I didn't like Mookie (marisue) at first....and Nenette (antoinette) and Mook had some tension from high school.... let me tell you how it all became.... ***************************************************************************************************** Marisue became the girlfriend of Marvynn's (my boyfriend at the time) best friend, Christopher.  And i thought "oh great"...and for a while Christopher never brought her around and I would always tease him, questioning, "why are you with her?"... and of course she felt the same about me...feeling weird that we would eventually have to meet and kick it cuz of our boyfriends.... well one day it happened.... her and chris actually just stopped by... and she was cool.... totally easy going.... well it just so happened that our boyfriends were going out of town that weekend...so me and Mook made plans.... that weekend was GREAT!@#$!....totally clicked with no effort and no awkward silences... it just flowed.... and ever since then we've been joined at the hip....so nette comes along and hears that mook and I are tight and she's confused....wondering how the heck her and I came to be..... i practically had to convince the two to kick it and give it a try....and just as simple as that....it worked.... and it's been us three ever since....we each have our own unique personalities that amazingly fits together somehow...but I am truly blessed to have them in my life.  They would definitely be one of the reasons why I'm as strong and confident as I am today....you'll definitely learn to know more about them later.....

      freaken bad news yet good....  I GOT LAID OFF! *sigh! i need a job.... my company isn't doing too well so they had to downsize... but whatever right? i hated my job anyway...I knew that I didn't hold any value at all.... so oh well... but I do need a job.... part time....monday/wednesday/friday.  So if you guys know anyone let me know kay? I'm actually going to talk to Ameesh next week (my old boss at Aarohi)...it turns out that the girl that replaced me there is not doing a good job....I spoke to Paul today (he's the IT guy there) and he told me that everyone was unhappy about Tiffany.... here's an example:  Ameesh goes to Tiffany and asks her if she could go drop of a packet to our lawyers.  Tiffany says, "Can't I just Fedex it?"....Ameesh doesn't say anything...turns around and walks to his office, gathers his things, goes back to Tiffany and says, "Give it to me, I'll take care of it myself."........  Oh mun!!!!! so bad! I don't know why they haven't gotten rid of her yet! well oppurtunity for me right? they LOVED me there and Paul and Jeff (an engineer at Aarohi) always calls me to come back...so we'll see how that goes....  so yeah...i'm at home now...and on the other hand...where the grass is greener....it's LABOR DAY weekend! (like it matters to me cuz I don't have a job)..... but I am going to LA!!! wooo hoo! going with $ and fellow compadres Sexilog and sexilogette shawnee... packed car...but you know what?

      hey everyone! it's monday afternoon and my day is not too bad...not too bad at all.  It's HOT outside but I haven't gotten the chance to feel it cuz I'm in my cold cold office.... so my weekend was fabulous!!!!  Friday - went to a purse party with mis and got myself a burberry purse with a matching wallet for only $60!!! woo hoo! I'm soo good! oh yeah! if anyone is interested to going to one of these let me know cuz we're throwing one at Mis' house at the end of September....  Got home at 10ish and got ready for Francis' birthday party....my company: krystle, danielle, janelle, ohtee...francis lives in newark at The Lake...and his house just so happens to be in the court that's  on  the lake...so his backyard overlooks the lake...anyway....the party was held in his backyard...tiki torches/bbq/oysters/strobelights...nice!... we walked right in right when they were going to take the first shot of the night....barcadi limon....yum! I ate at the purse party so it took me a little longer than expected to feel the buzz....ms. hardcore mama krystle kept persuading to take more shots since we haven't kicked it in so long...so here we go... 5-6-7- 8 shots!!! no more after that cuz I had the tahitian workshop to go to.... it was rolling towards 2am....and i REALLY had to go home... we were all way to drunk to have anyone go home yet...so mingled some more with a lot of people I haven't seen in a long while....3am...went home and passed out.  Saturday morning -  Rich: It's 9o'clock...wake up Christine: Oh muuunn....i'm still drunk (calling Shawn) Shawn: Hello Christine: hey...I just woke up...I think I'll just meet you and Maureen there k? Shawn: Are you sure? I told you not to drink so much (hehehe) Christine: I know...don't worry I'll be there Shawn: Ok bye.  Left my house at 930, bought some gatorade at the local liquor store and made it at 945....The workshop was awesome! Definitely hard work whipping or should I say "hitting" our hips from side to side...but it definitely helped me sweat the alcohol out of me....I even saw some of my high school mates there...small world huh? can't wait till class starts...september 2nd...$40/month...not bad eh? That's my excuse out of the gym...I hate the gym...  Saturday afternoon -  Had combosilog at New luk Yuen in the Une....yummy! had Bangus and longanisa....Mmmmmm..mm...then went home and off to Tahoe we went....we meaning $ and myself.... thank you Rich for driving all the way there and letting my inebriated body sleep....got there at 8oclock had dinner at Samurai sushi....not too bad although the prices were steep...went back to mel's house and as soon as we pulled up into the driveway i realized I left my bag at the restaurant! omigod!!! my wallet! my makeup bag!!!! my CAMERA!!!!!!!!!  ooohh noo!!  I called the restaurant and luckily they had it...everything was in it...... phew! that was close!@#$! ...we  TRIED  calling Chary and Terry so we could hook up...but  THEY  didn't  ANSWER  their phones! Boooooo!!!...got back to Mel's around 10ish and met with Merianne to watch SWAT.....4 thumbs up for that movie! and yes...COLIN FARRELL IS MIGHTY HOT!...went to bed at 1am dreaming happily of Colin ....*sigh..   Sunday Afternoon -  WOKE UP! Found bacon and eggs ready for us in the kitchen! yummy! Big Ups to Auntie Anita! Left half an hour later to hike the trail to Angora Lake...totally beautiful scenery....totally in the boondocks...cuz you have to hike less than half a mile before you actually hit the Lake and then you see cabins and a beach where there were a lot of people bathing and having picnics....me and $ continued our hike around the lake through huge boulders to the infamous cliff jumping area....saw a lot of cute half naked white boys...but never as cute as hottie Colin Farrell......saw more crazy white boys jump the cliff....took some cute cuddly pictures with $ and went back around to the beach.....the water was freezing but went in anyway....after about 10 minutes of swimming....dried up and was on our way to our bike trails.... but before that we took a little scenic drive around Fallen Leaf Lake where we saw the rich people of the town......megahuge cabins with all window walls and their own dock and everything....reminded me of the movie Beethoven 2....remember when they went camping...and the eldest daughter got invited to this party and the hot hunk jerk was trying to harrass her but Beethoven saved the day by pulling the house down?  ....good beethoven...good beethoven...  ha!....but yeah...the houses were like that.....  SORRRYYY!!!  left that area really quick and biked our way around Pope Beach and Camp Richardson.... my freakin hamstrings and calves were killing me by then....$ bought me some new shoes at the Adidas Outlet! $20.11!!! Thanks BABE! and had some home cooked dinner at Mel's......yummy! Left to go home at 812pm....then turned back around to do massive #2... then finally left to go home at 830...thanks to $ for driving the whole way back again! you are awesome!!!!!! ......got home at midnight....  what a fun filled weekend...ETA for pictures: TONIGHT!

      how come my brother wants to kick it more with my sister than me? Yes...I do feel butthurt about that.  We're supposed to be going to Tahoe together but instead he wants to stay with Jen...and they don't even have anything planned yet....  I know that I see him everyday so why not have him kick it with her right? But just because we live together doesn't necessarily mean that we're spending good qt together you know?  I just wished sometimes that he actually  wanted  to kick it with me.  I guess my sister is more lenient on him... and I play the role of parent so of course I have to hold some type of authority against him yeah know? But I feel bad...I want him to know that although I can be kinda strict or whatever... that I do have the best intentions at heart...and yet at the same time I can still be cool too... *sigh.... so anyway... I told him that he's going to be staying with Jen Labor Day weekend anyway because I'm going to LA so he should come with us to Tahoe this weekend.... and he's like okay if you want me to.... and i'm like okay bye.... and I feel bad...cuz he's known for a while already that we were planning to go to Tahoe...and I  thought  that he  wanted  to go... but now I feel like I'm just forcing him to go...so if I just want make him come will he think that I'm just being the mean sister again? How will he know how fun it is to be with me if he doesn't go? Or should I let him just go with my sister because he wants to be there.... man...must be really tough being a parent...

      just found out about this filipino restaurant that's near by and they serve SILOG's! yeah!!!!  So i called them to order some tocilog... and why do they tell me it'll be ready in 40 minutes! ggeeeeezus! hella modes....oh well..it'll definitely be worth the wait.....yummy!   anyway...looks like i'm spending the night in mateo.  me and rich can carpool in the morning... i can drop him off at work then go to school....ooOooh! what convenience! oh yeah I wanted to share my dream that I had during nap time on Tuesday...  SCENE: Old, big house....furniture broken and scattered everywhere....  (I'm walking through the house horrified to see all these people in the house lying around dead) RICH -  (jumps out) Are you okay? ME -  (screams)  don't scare me like that!!! yeah, I'm okay...what the heck is going on? RICH - I don't know...but let's get out of here... (we start to walk downstairs) XCOTO -  (enters with some random people) Is everyone okay? hurry...let's get out of here before more come (Rich and I look at each other, confused)  RICH/ME - huh? (XCOTO dosen't answer and we start following him out of the house) (A groan is heard from behind us) XCOTO -  (yells)  Get out of the way!! ME -  (turns around)  what the hell???? (I turn around to find one of the dead bodies growing, mutating into some kind of monster.  The monster begins to get up and looks at me) RICH - Get the gun!@#$! ME - What gun! (looks around for gun...finds a shot gun) (I pick up the gun, cock the sucker, and fire!.... shoot! ...it's not loaded!) XCOTO -  (reaching in his pocket)  Here! Load it up! Aim for his head! Aim for his head! (I take the bullets, load the shotgun and before the monster has time to fully mutate and start chasing us... I point the gun right smack in the middle of his forehead and  BANG!!!!!  the monster's head explodes and we're covered in mush! We finally proceed out of the house and the next thing you know we're surrounded by helicopters, police, and a whole bunch of people in those suits that you wear to keep you from hazardous stuff...forgot what they were called....they tell us to get into their vans...but while they're in the house checking out the scence me and the others escape! we take an abandoned van and drive off..... )  The end.... don't know why I dreamed about that... i must've seen that commercial of Silent Hill 3 before I fell asleep... you know the one where the girl says, "you think it's scary being alone, it's even more scary when you're found"... or something like that...

      okay.... so i mentioned  DRAMA  on Monday right.... unfortunately it wouldn't be right to mention exactly what happened on such a public diary as this one.... so let me just sum up the main focal points of the situation...... (so without mentioning anyone's names....) i guess you could kinda tell what's its about because of $'s emotional statment on  urlLink SEXILOG ....yes.... Xtine vs. X...it's really not a big deal.... and the situation never had anything to do with me in the first place....it turned out that $ and X still had some unfinished business... and the frustration there made X say some things about Xtine that wasn't necessary.... so yeah.... anyway...... yesterday $ and X had a good productive talk and all is well.... so no more drama..... YyYyyyYYAAAyyYYyYyyyyY!

I probably hula hooped for about 5 seconds and it was his turn.... this guy couldn't even get it around his waist once! so I got the beer! yyyyeeeah! free beer!!!! it turned out that we got a hottie waitress too! She was a BBB (BIG BUST & BUTT)! woo hoo! one of the better looking ones there....anyway...after loads of chicken wings and after the hooter girls sang happy birfday to mookie.... who had yits and no butts...yuck ....they presented mookie with a bottle of some Dom P....woo hoo! celebration time!

EEEeeEeeeEeeekkkKkKkkkk! .....anyway...i went home got ready and went to Sherra's birthday! Sherra is joy and rizzi's neice...we went to this place called Pump it Up in Union City... and the activities took place in this massive room with hecka types of astro jumps! they had a huge slide one...like the ones from the carnivals.... and they had a blowup obstacle course one with all these loops and columns you had to pass through.... and they had this basketball one too where you can jump hella high and make a slam dunk! man! i was tearing it up on the court! hahahah!...and then after an hour and half you get transferred to this smaller rooms where you eat pizza and mingle... thought it was a fun thing to do for a kids birthday... but i heard from ate that it's expensive though! oh well! i don't have to worry about that cuz I don't got KIDS..awkay! my money is for me and me only!!! HAHAHAHAH!

      Nothing to do at work....again....man! what a waste of time!   Anyway, yesterday I was ultra emotional and sensitive... Don't know why... maybe cuz my periods at an end.... well in any case.... on my way home from work yesterday I was getting pissed off at every car that passed me by....whether it was because he was driving slow or her car was hella dirty or whatever... i was just irked....irked irked irked..... I got home and my grandma and grandpa was watching some old school home videos that my dad made.... of my sister graduating the DARE program...ha!.... and then of my brother getting his purple belt in Tae Kwon Do.... ha! That was when he used to be totally overweight and shorter than me!..... I even got to see the video of my 13th birthday party! SOOOOOOO old skool!!!! It wasn't even a party....well it was.... I had a DJ and everything.... but instead of us guys and girls dancing and mingling...the garage was turned into a circle for breakdancers! GroundRock Crew vs. the Renegades.... hahaha!.... I probably met half the party that night... but it was cool.... cuz it was back in the days where there was no funk or no drinking required to have fun..... girls were shy to talk to guys.... guys were too busy trying to practice their flares and whatever else they did.... and you know what! Ryan Roque was there too! ha! All us youngstas thought Ryan, George, Eric, and all them older Irvington guys were H O T T I E S!@##!?!  Nette was there too still looking exactly as she does now...Krystle with her glasses......Danielle and Aileen with their overalls......Just all occupied with who likes who and worried that they had to leave early cuz their curfew was at 10:00pm..... ....And here we are....9 years later....omigod!!!!! Am i old or what! frick! I'm glad I have that video.... totally holds memories of my past.... of how things came to be.... and boy.... I was not Ca-UTE! hahahhhahaha.....But I can definitely look back and just reminisce of those old times.... *sigh....  blah blah blah.....  anyhow....after a huge ass plate of sinigang that my grams made.....YUMMMMMYYYY!! Thanks grandma!.....I just remained lazy on the sofa watching wheel of fortune.... Roses and Carnations!Why are you buying a vowel? Solve! Roses and Carnations you idiot! .....   After that... I went to drop off my grandparents at Uncle Roger's house where I watched a little bit of Dr. Phil.... the show was about twins that couldn't get along.... the first twins were mexican girls probably 18 or 19.... and they talked about how they just couldn't get along and they didn't understand why....so Dr. Phil turned their chairs around and had them face each other....not saying anything...but to just look at each other.... and they started bawling!@#!... and so did I!!! omigod....so they told each other that they didn't want to fight anymore and they wanted to spend more time together.... oh mun!!! was i bawling or what!...the next twins were two young boys...probably like 11 or 12....and they were being boys in their home videos...throwing things at each other...wrestling on the floor.... telling each other they wanted to kill each other.... anyway.... Dr. Phil starts doing his thing and asks why... and the more dominant twin starts saying that he does love and care about his brother but sometimes he would just cause problems which would make him mad..... and while he's telling this to Dr. Phil...the other twin start crying....his head is down and he is straight sobbing.....so Dr. Phil goes to him and asks him why are you sad? and he said that he thinks his other brother hates him cuz he never talks to him and he wishes that he would hang around with him more and so on and so on..... (so here's where I start crying).....Dr. Phil goes back to the more dominating one... and he's on the verge of crying too....his chin is trembling...but he's trying so hard to suck it in.... and Dr. Phil says Did you know you're brother felt this way?  and he replies no....and then you see tears roll down his face.... and Dr. Phil asks  What do you think you should do to make your relationship with your brother better?  and he says that he should talk to him more and have him hang out with him at school more... and he looks at his brother and tells him he's sorry....and he starts hella bawling...and OH MUN...I start bawling!!!!!!! so sad!!! so sad!!!! I couldn't take it after that...  so i go home where Rich and Brit are waiting for me.... I spend some time with them watching Ike beat and rape Tina in her sound room... oops....Brit shouldn't watch that ...changed the channel and watched National ________ forgot..... ended my night there pretty much....   Oh yeah! forgot to tell you! Mel's moving in! My apartments only a two bedroom place...but for as far as I could remember my brother has always slept in the living room... don't know why... so I figured since mel is trying to find a place to stay fast...she could stay with me until a 3 bedroom opens up and we could transfer...doesn't cost anything to transfer so why not? plus it will help me big time when I start cutting my work hours next week..... my brother loves mel so there shouldn't be any problems at all.... woo hoo! LNO center baby! hahhahah...  okay that's it for now.... welcome to blogger CHARY!

Who: me, mook, lot, zoy, melanie, melissa, julie, kim, and kelby...... hooked up at Kim's house around 10ish..... we were suppose to have dinner... but obviously we hooked up too late.... rolled up to San Jose Bar & Grill... dude...the place was packed! totally cool vibe... a mixed crowd of older people..... well older than us....anyway..... did the usual mingling...taking pictures....5 second sips.... and we were off to regular and so familiar F&A's! woo hoo!!! by the time we got there we were all pretty buzzed....but hey! that ain't stoppen us from drinking more! One of the waitresses were going around yelling $2 shots! so me, mook, and kim handed her some dollar bills... and BOOM!!! swig!! from there I knew that I had a wee too much to drink.... took more pictures..... took pictures in the patio...took pictures on the dancefloor..took pictures in the bathroom..... too many pictures!  By the end of the night... we were all faded.. I even made myself yak in the  bathroom to regain composure.... Phew..... felt much better after that..... too faded to drive home... thanks mel for being light weight and being able to drive! definitely saved our lives! Stopped by the Shell Station on the way home..... zoy yaked...I yaked.... dropped off Julie at the Waterford.... I yaked.....got home....Rich carried up... and I yaked some more.... woo hoo! Fun filled night of pictures and yaks!    Friday  - while everyone was getting up and getting ready for work... my ass was lying in bed suffering from the worse freakin hang over..... called in sick at work.... took 2 tylenols... uploaded the pics.... and laid upside down on my sofa at home till my headache went away....Around 1ish I felt much better.. got ready and went to Mook's.....spent some time with my godson Bishop..... gawd... he is the most adorable thing....hella fat, bald, and playful...... definitely a brat.... but still so precious..... well baby daddy came home... hahaha.... chris.. i mean.. and bish and him left... so me and mook went to do our errands....went to the bank... went to the mall.....bought mika's bday gift....can you believe that I found.....(okay okay...Mookie found)... 2 Ralph Lauren dresses at Macy's for $19 each! woo hoo! sooo cute! oh...who's mika? she's my neice that just turned 2 and she was having her birthday party Saturday at Quarry Lakes.....anyway.... spent another 2 hours or so walking around the mall... tired as hell... so why'd we continue walking? um hello! it's the mall! you sooo have to be there! hahah...yeah right..... OoooOH! found some cute sandal shoes at Payless for $8!!!! Payless is cuts sometimes! ha!....okay. okay.... boring day.... bought groceries... and me and Rich went to Alameda to pick up my grandparents.... got home at 11... then went to bed....obviously my body hasn't recovered from the night before.....   Saturday  - slept in till about 11... still groggy... after 12 hours of sleep? dude! definitely overslept.... got ready and around 2ish went to quarry lakes with my grandparents.... my sister themed the party Hawaiian style w/ Lilo & Stitch decor... pineapples hanging from the canopies....little umbrellas in the drinks...and lei's for all the guests.... cool huh? it was pretty cool seeing all my family and a lot of old friends..... lowlight: TOO WINDY>>>>...haven't posted the pics... but I will today.... had plenty to eat... but didn't do my #3! woo hoo! figured there was no clean bathroom to caca in... so better not overload my tummy...although there was a massive feast! The guys played football while the ladies watched the kids.... dude...made me realize how old I was! geez!!! anyway....ended the picnic around 8ish....    Saturday Night  - hung with the Sexilog crew and mel.... we hit up Forum around 1130... well we were suppose to be there at 1130... but you know how that goes.... got in for free.... ditched the guys..... me and mel were able to peep the winner of the lap dance contest do her thing....  how the hell did she get her legs to get up there??? .....and then made our way to the 2nd floor where we spent most of the night where there was actually air to breathe and room to dance.....mikey ended up meeting some hot mexicana who had a thing for his bootie....he would've danced with her but he was having too much of a great time being gay with his boyfriends: charles, rich, and edsel..... after a little more dancing.... we decided to leave.... on our way back to our cars... mikey and charles decide to take pictures and pose proudly in front of some old skool volvo.... me and mel were thinking... dude...hella messed up how they're clowning the people who took this ride here....they better hurry before they get caught! ....so finally we decide to get into our cars so we can go eat... and who would've thought!@#$! they were getting into that volvo! It was actually Mikey's ride! hahahahah! My bad mikey! ha! anyway...went to Denny's...ate and went home.... too tired to actually go home...so i stayed at Rich's....overall a good night.....   Sunday  -  went with my grandparents to visit mom and dad.... spent some time with them and told them stories of what's been going on..... after that went to play golf with mel and ed....did some chipping and putting.... it's definitely not as easy as it looks.... then hit the range.... only my 3rd time around...but I've definitely gotten better! Oh yeah! Bought myself a glove too! woo hoo! Definitely played a role at getting my balls up..... can't wait to go again....had dinner at Nguyen Vu in Newark...then went home and got lazy......THE END  *sigh... too bad the weekend is over... another work week ahead of us..... Cabo is coming up! woo hoo! can't wait for that!   anyhow...just wanted to say thanks to Rich....for putting up with my brattiness... the time of the month really isn't a fun occasion....but he puts up with it anyway....I hate this period thing that us women unfortunately can't avoid...but having him with me has definitely made my cranky days.....not so cranky.....how sweet huh? Thanks for making my days so productive and effortless hun....

      The heck?  okay so here's the deal... I just finished working on a telecom project which basically consists of me collecting rates from several phone service providers....dude... you'd think simple right? Local Rate, Long Distance Rate, T-1 Rate, blah blah... but no.... anyway.... back to my point.... so Andre (the COO) refers me to a local SBC rep, Robert, to collect information from.  He didn't get back to me soon enough so I dialed the 800 number to get rates.... then of course Robert calls me too.... so I receive proposals from two different reps from the same company..... neither of them knowing i'm talking to either of the two right..... anyway.... i was expecting to receive the same rates.... and sure enough... I don't..... so....obviously we go with Robert since he has the lower rates.... anyway.... Tracy... the 800 CR rep emails me today wanting a follow up on the project...of course i told her that we are definitely going to go with SBC but a different rep has provided me better rates..... okay.... so just now i received a rebuttle from her proclaiming she didn't understand why we were going with him because she would have the best service yaddy yaddy yah.... and i'm thinking in my head... what the heck? We are still going with SBC! You are on the same team!!!......moded

      Okay so this morning... our Controller came up to me and starts talking about her period...how she has three different sets of wardrobe cuz she can be a size 4 one day then a size 10 the other day... and she goes on.... according to my pills I'm suppose to get my period on Saturday... but I've been bleeding for 60 days now...I've had surgery on this before... they had to scrape the inside and outside of my uterus ...blah blah blah......and I'm sitting there in front of her...just casually nodding my head... commenting...whatever.... but really in my head.... woah sister! let's keep our blood stories to ourselves! ... don't get me wrong... I know that girls can talk about that stuff to each other... but I don't even talk to her!!!... she actually started 2 weeks after I did.... and the most words I've gotten from her on a daily was Hi Christine, how are you today?... and that's it.... I mean how am I suppose to react to blood stories! I mean are you even married...do you have kids... where are you from.... but not how long have you been bleeding for..... dude.... oh well... at least i know i can be cool with the controller.... she's hot by the way... for being this almost menopause woman.... greatly in shape... big yitters....blonde....long lashes...crystal blue eyes.... (I ain't checkin her out now... so don't get any ideas!!!!)... but yeah... it's always good to get semi personal with the execs.... that's a sign that they're cool with you yeah know? well back to work.....

      My Interests:   1) Decorating  maybe I could be an interior decorator! muunn! that would be so dope! I wonder what it takes to do that...when I was living with my parents I used to rearrange my entire room once a month....all my junk would be in the middle of the hallway and my grandma used to nag at me for not being able to make up my mind...but little did she know...this was my passion....uuuaaahhh!   2) Shopping  A buyer! man that would be tight too... all i have to do is choose items that would go out next season.... how cool is that.... i've even had a couple of friends who wanted me to shop for them.... hmm...kinda scary though huh... what if they didn't like what I chose... then I would be to blame... but I'm still down to do that.... spend someone else's money? who wouldn't!   3) Photography  Photographer? hmmm...that's more of a hobby to me than to do for a living... I'm hoping though that one day... I could get a big enough house to turn one of the rooms in a dark room....OooOOOhhhHH...cool huh?   4) Writing  A  Dear Christine  maybe? haha! Or maybe a journalist for Vogue or Cosmo... you know just like Kate Hudson in  How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days ...really cute movie by the way....that's so a no brainer... making up quizzes about being too stubborn or knowing if he's the  One ...and you'll get free stuff too! oh man! i'm dreaming now! haha!   5) Talking  A radio host...A teacher?  nah...  A counselor of some kind... hmmm.. I do always have something to say.... and I'm not afraid of being brutally honest... sometimes people have to hear the truth right? How are you suppose to be a better person refusing to hear the truth? see.... I'm good at that....   nursing.....  *sigh ....that's good... I guess.....

      So when I usually have time in the morning...I make my way to Starbucks for a Grande White Chocolate Mocha... I used to make it triple... but figured I'm too small to be overloaded with caffeine.... so I stuck to the regular.... anyway...that would help me through the day... but lately...i've been to work kinda late... so I don't have time to drop by Starbucks.... I thought I'd be okay...it's been several days since I had any coffee... but today... thought I'd have some....so I make my way into the breakroom and see the only coffee they have is Folgers....  whoopie ....I take my cup... use 2 packets of sugar....3 moo moos... and coffee.... I go back to my desk and sip...... uuugggghh! no taste! ...so I make my way back to the breakroom... and get 2 more sugar packets and 2 more moo moos.... go back to my desk.... concoct....sip..... a little bit more sugar ...go back to the breakroom...grab 2 more packets....  hmmm...I'll take 3 more just in case .....mix.... taste.....add the other 3 packets....and  VOILA! ...cafe de Christine.... a freakin whole lot a sugar... but man....that'll have to do for today.... tomorrow...starbucks or none at all....   I hate that I'm growing dependent on coffee...I know that it's not good for me... especially when I'm trying to lose a few pounds.... then what? tea? water? not gonna work for me buddy.... I hate working... I hate the fact that I'm going to be doing this for the next 40 years or so. Monday - Friday, 9-5.... what a waste of my life right? Why can't I be doing something more fulfilling... something that actually has meaning to my life....but then again... isn't that everyone's wonder?  *sigh... I just hope that whatever I end up doing after I finish school will be something I actually look forward to doing.... I used to think that it wouldn't matter to me what I studied for... just finish school... so yeah...nursing... and I'm fine with that cuz I really haven't found my passion... there's an interest for it... kinda no brainer when you think about it... and I'll get paid fairly well.... but now that I think about it.... I picture myself running something...running some type of business.... making deals with clients... I feel like I'm good at talking... don't want to get into sales though....forget that...... but running a company... there's a purpose... to make the company succeed.... i guess it's kinda hard to say.... what type of company would I want to run? computers? tech? ....  nah... I'm defiinitely not techy ..... maybe something small....me, mook, my sister were talking once about opening up a salon...... that would be so fun to decorate the whole place.... I'm sure we have enough friends to be our clients.... hmmm...maybe... mookie's going to be going to school for cosmotology... just for fun... then my sister wants to do that too for fun...maybe in several years from now we can discuss opening something up.... who knows....   went from coffee to opening a salon.... isn't it cool how things just happen? hehehe...that's another randome to write about later.... ta ta!

Recap of last night:  8:30pm  After a long, wholesome, scrumptious dinner at my auntie maggie's house,  my grandparents get their things together. I sit on the sofa watching Dr. Phil...  gurgle gurgle ...my brother and my Uncle Roger are messing around on their phones texting each other stupid jokes..... gurgle gurgle ....I take a deep breath and get up...walk around... wondering if I should go now or can I hold it?  Grandma: let's go! we're ready!  Grandpa:are you sure you didn't forget anything? make sure or you'll make us turn around again...  (and knowing my grandma...she ALWAYS forgets something)...

       i hate mondays ...woke up at 9 today... hahahha...i was aiming for 7... but there was this movie on last night...something Hot Sexy Summer? Well something like that... and there was a whole bunch of people on it...it was made in 2001... but that short girl from  The Truth About Cats and Dogs  was in it.. and that dude that Alicia Silverstein in  Clueless  fell in love with at the end was in it....and that tarets (sp?) girl from  Deuce Bigalow  was in it...and some other cats too... but it was weird and hilarious! It was about the last day at summer camp.... and those people that I mentioned above were counselors... well... it was a crazy movie....and because of that i didn't go to bed till about 2am..... Rich and I were both late....oh well.... it's Monday and I really don't seem to care right now...  so my weekend? spent it practically doing nothing and being nothing but lazy.... great weekend! thought after all the weekends i've been out of town or doing something... that i deserved a weekend of being lazy... hehehhee..but i'll tell you what i did anyway.... so in my last entry you heard about my Friday.... no comment   Saturday --> After Rich's...we went to Marissa and J's and did nothing... watched  Deliver Us From Eva ....can i just say one thing? LL COOL J has the most sexiest crumptious lips....oooooooh mun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! then went to eat Pho and then went back to their house to watch  Tears of the Sun  with Bruce Willis....dude...really really good movie... it's about American soldiers who are out on a mission to rescue this doctor who works at a mission in Africa... don't want to go on into details..... just watch...trust me...it's good! got home at 1230 this night...oh yeah..buzz spent the night too...it was his first night over actually.... and boy he could not sleep.... he wasn't familiar with the place and every noise he heard at night made him jump and start barking...poor baby.... i want him over more often so he gets used to my place.....  Sunday --> Went rollerblading around Lake Elizabeth with Rich, J, Missa, and Brit.....totally fun.. i haven't had the chance to do that in a long time.... i swear i was gonna fall on my ass... but i didn't.... i'm just good like that... ha! Then watched Pirates of the Carribean....good movie too...Johnny Depp played well.... kinda comedic and full of action too.... AND legasi is in it? Legasi? Leglasi? Man..forgot... but he was the dude from Lord of the Rings... the elph with the bow and arrow... you know... the HOT looking one.... yeah he's in it... and he's just as fine as ever! hahahaha.... went to walmart after.... bought bathroom necessities...blah blah...  and that's the end of my weekend! it was great being lazy... but in all honesty... i'm having a hard time trying to pull up my energy for the work week... *sigh... 1215 only? sheesh..............

      okay....sappy time....  What do you do after being with someone for years but things just aren't working out anymore?  Even after attempts and attempts of trying to work things out, do you still try working at it?  Is  we've been through so much together  a good enough reason to continue the relationship even though you're unhappy? How do you let go of something you've spent so much time and effort with?  It's hard trying to work at relationships.  Relationships are NEVER perfect and everyone knows that.  Of course, from time to time you'll run into things that you both don't agree on and from there you both should try to compromise a way to make things work for the both of you right?  And when you've done something wrong, it's the right thing to do to admit to your faults and apologize right?  And if the other one does something wrong and they do apologize, you should accept it and even if you don't understand, you should try to understand anyway right?  I can continue listing the rules and regulations of a relationship, but in all honesty there is no  How To .  How can you list how to work a relationship? Just not possible....  I just think that relationships should just be based on being happy.  Understanding, caring, listening, appreciating.....and all that other stuff counts too of course...but bottom line...I just think relationships shouldn't have to be "worked" on... like there should be nothing hard about being in a relationship.  The compromising parts and all of that may get frustrating and those "bad" days may cause some bitchiness....but all in all.... the way you approach the situation can totally make the difference on how hard and bad the situation can get.

      How dee doo dee.... okay...so I think it's about time for an update....It's been almost a month since I've been laid off and I have to admit I've been really lagging at trying to find a job... I guess after all these years of working...since I was 19... I was kinda relieved to take a nice break and focus on school and whatnot.... so you know I so badly want to finish school...and I'm having a great time doing homework(whhhuuut???) and going to class (well sometimes) and getting ma edumacation on (really!).... for the last two weeks I've honestly been hard looking for a job....part time job to accomodate my school schedule.....well let me tell yall something...times are rough and it's sooo hard to find something that'll work around you....it just ain't happening yeah know?...so today....   first off... I break a nail at the gas station...freaken A! Don't you hate that! You spend all this time trying to manicure your nails and all that...and when one breaks...you HAVE to cut all of them...cuz that is sooo nuuu-Asty to have your middle finger cut to it's shortest point and have the rest of your fingers all long.....that's like having long pinky nails! gross!!!!!!  secondly...i go to my mailbox and STILL NO severence check! sheeesh! See! I knew I hated that job for a reason! I better get it tomorrow or I'm throwing hell....other than that...the worse news is still to come....  I got a letter from EDD...hoping that it was informing me of how much benefits I'd be receiving....but no.... it was a letter denying me benefits due to my availability to work.......now that totally put me in a pissy ass mood.... I'm getting punished I know I am....   it freaken confuses the hell out of me cuz I'm trying to do good with my life...trying to establish my career...become more than I am....and money seems to be depriving me from getting there...how ironic huh? I mean how am I suppose to be more if I can't take the steps to do more? urk!   LUCKILY: Audra...who's one of my connections in the Silicon V called me today.... and told me of this new startup company in Sunnyvale, just got funded and is guaranteed to not have to fund again because they'll be making revenue within the next year.... they're looking for someone.... and she thinks the position would be perfect for me...seems like a great opportunity..the CEO is looking for someone who'll run the show and get things done with no supervision....and I know I can do that....I've done it already....Piece of cake!@#$! so.....................I have an interview tomorrow....PHEW! well cross out unemployment for me...Next on my list: FINISH SCHOOL!!!!!!!!!! Audra told me that they'd be willing to accomodate to my school schedule until the semester end and then have to commit to full time after....and if I was going to continue going to school, I'd have to take night classes and they'd be willing to flex my schedule to accomodate night classes..... eeegggghh...kinda iffy.... cuz that's what I've been trying to do forever... and it's just hard and exhausting.....but hey....i got to suck it up......forreal.... if I want to do this....then I HAVE to do this....my whole mission kinda backfired on me.... so i'll be graduating maybe at 25-26...but that's $'s age...so no problem! ha! just kidding babe!   All I know is....there's no doubt in my mind that school definitely a priority for me....and working full time again won't stop me from going to school....it's really up to me to put in the effort right? So blah..... life's a bitch.... but at the end I know everything works out the way you make it to.....

      hey it's saturday right now on a freaken hot ass day at the San Mateo house.....it's approximately 1:40 in the afternoon and I'm freaking lazy as heck.  In the household are housemates money signs, mikey, charles with house guest mel.....what to do today? don't know yet...but let me continue with the stories of LNO:Part 4.........  so Mookie's hurricane was nasty...and thought in her head, "If we were at F&A's the Hurricane's would taste so much better!"...so she FORCED us to follow her to F&A's.... we probably got there around midnightish and got in line...Mookie was on the side trying to call everyone she knew to get us in...after all she owns the title of Most Valuable Regular...hehe!.but unfortunately we were too late even for Miss Valuable...... We decided to head on over to Agenda but before that we had to conquer the upscale porta-potty where many memories took place...7 girls in one stall taking pictures....why girls actually go to the bathroom in groups.... I can never reveal............ well.... we finally departed our ways from Sexilog even though they insisted to stay with us...Sorry dudes...the night just can't be LNO with GNO trying to kick it with us yeah feel? So we hit Agenda...and thanks to Joy our negotiator, we were able to get in for $5 rather than $10...thanks zoy!...the place was PACKED! woo hoo!!!!!!!! Union City reunion! We ran into Club Caspar and the party was on!!!!! We left the club an hour later drunk happy as ever with my memory stick full....and that was the end....made myself throw up cuz my room wouldn't stop spinning....and i fell asleep and slept in till 1030 the next morning cuz I STILL don't have a job....and I was still drunk.......*sigh.....what a wonderful life!

      UPDATE: I am still unemployed.... with no unemployment coming...  oh mun...sounds bad huh? well i have an interview on thursday... don't know what they do...but they're looking for someone to manage their office....and they seem to work around my schedule...so yeah...hopefully I get it....in the meantime I reopened my claim at EDD....telling them that I no longer go to school....so I can get my freakin money...  so i've been seriously thinking about moving out to a smaller place....mun...my rent expenses is what's killing me...but then again i don't know if it's worth it to break my lease...does that show on your credit report? if you break your lease? At least the fee isn't to pay out the lease till the end of the contract... it's one month's rent...which isn't bad... but.....still...it might be a waste of money...mun...i hate financial predicaments...ugh!   how's everything else going in my life...everything's going great actually...i'm not trying to let the money situation mess up the other things in my life that's going well...school's doing great...i'm doing really well in my classes...me and my girls are still kicken it hard core...LNO...LIKE NO OTHER! ha! Mark Bautista gave us that...cool huh? heheheeh...me and $ are doing really well too...he's been there to support me and encourage me during this depressing stage in my life.... you're great babe! it gets really depressing when you don't have anything to do....i mean it would be great to have no obligations to do anything....just do as you wish to fulfill your life...but if there's no income...how the heck do you that right? so yeah....   i'll start updating more...so until then.....

      "sappy time" continuation...I didn't end my sappy time blog right...it kinda just fell off the cliff...so let me start again...  so there's no reason specifically why i'm writing this...it's just the last year has been filled with many relationships that have flourished and have finished. Some relationships happening for as little as two weeks and others that have lasted for as long as 5 years....and if I was to share these thoughts with my aunt or someone with much much more experience in living their lives they would probably look at me and say that I've only come to know that first pieces of the puzzle...but I think it's all the same at any age.  If you're in love, it'll feel just as powerful and passionate as the first boyfriend/girlfriend you've had in 8th grade.  And just like your first broken heart, your next broken heart will feel just as devastating....  the way you approach the situation can totally make the difference on how hard and bad the situation can get...and no matter how unbearably frustrating it gets...you just have to remember that you're talking to the person you supposedly love and care about and would do  anything  for....so when you're talking...fighting...arguing...whatever you want to call it...respect them.  Speak your opinions....even if you don't ever agree about whatever you guys are fighting about...the name calling...the overpowering tone of voice...especially any physical contact...even if you're not even touching the person...like you're so in their face that they can feel the heat of your breath......it's just not necessary and it's just not worth it....you make the problem into an issue that has grown ten times bigger than where you've started....and this goes for both men and women.... a lot of the relationships that I've heard about is about how they've been disrespected...about how someone calls so and so bitch or f-you...or even little things like calling someone stupid or "you don't know anything".... maybe one way you could save your relationship is remembering that they should be treated how you want to be treated. I mean I'm not trying to be a smart ass about this whole thing....but this is what we've all come to learn since we were little kids... to respect one another....you're relationship may be going through shit right now...but taking the step to respect one another will definitely make whatever you're going through a little bit easier.....  let's face it....we go through too much in our lives that stresses us out...so why make the one thing that's suppose to make life easier for you...you're partner...someone you love.....another item to stress about? which leads to my next concept....  I mean I've been there.... kinda...i guess at 22... I don't want to say I'm a guru at this relationship stuff....so what do i have to say? well...I've done the dating thing...been in the long term relationship (5 years)...and now I'm in the beginning of a new relationship that's going unbelievably well and I'm happy...I really am...and I'd like to think that my happiness is due partly to my theory...yeah yeah....this is kinda corny...but if you want to find out exactly what I'm talking about...read on...    KNOW WHAT YOU'RE WORTH AND NEVER SETTLE FOR ANYTHING LESS THAN WHAT YOU DESERVE

       urlLink Fancy Shmancy    --> that's exactly what V Bar was at the Santana Row....LNO made their mark there but of course... the only down side to it was that they didn't have a dance floor! How can you have some knocken music with some ansy drunk people walking around with no dance floor! mun! No cover charge which was good... but the drinks were like ultra dynamic expensive...$14 for a Long Beach (which is my drink by the way) and $10 for a well drink (cran & vodka, etc.)... so the girls initiated... too broke to splurge...mingled...and by the end of the night we all each had at least two drinks, were feeling a cool buzz and didn't have to spend a dime.... wow... now that is definitely an advantage of being a girl...or should I say Lady... or LADIES NIGHT OUT>.... uuuaaahh...   anyway, i'm at work right now and I'm about to be off in about half an hour... I'm leaving to Bakersfield this weekend for Rich's cousin's engagement party.  Definitely my first time to meet the extended family...but I'm definitely looking forward to it... ANNDD! I'm going to the Camarillo Outlets! hheeeeyy!!!! i'm trying to get an early start on christmas shopping... and I've already made my list...and hopefully for the first time I'll actually stick with the list and not add more to it... which I doubt... well...  have a great wet weekend!

      como estas mis compadres! oh mun...what a terrible nasty weekend it is! I'm at home and it's 8:31pm exactly and I'm not making any type of effort to really find out what's going on.... which is cool.... MelQ is coming over and we're suppose to go over to D&B's to celebrate Katrina's 25th birthday! Happy Birthday Nina! then there's some party in San Jose... but whatever... i'll just go with the flow tonight..  actually...i'm just lonely..I miss Rich... yeah yeah..I know...nasty cuz we pretty much see each other EVERYDAY...but he's gone this weekend... he went down south to visit his parents and friends...and I'm at home....stuck here cuz I got some catch-up work and homework to do... so yeah...gotta stay up on it right! But I still wish Rich was here so we can cuddle... hahahahha...oh mun...Nu-ASTY!  Last night I went to Zae's for Mark and Brian's Clashing Colors birthday party.... it was cool... they had a raffle to win a football jersey.... they had a photo background thing setup for those who wanted to take pictures on it... and they also had a slideshow of all the parties/clubs/vacations that they've had in the past....and I made it! like HELLA times! YESSS!!! hahahah... hella nasty....  by the way...  NASTY  has been my word lately...and as every other word in my exaggerated vocabularty.... it's some made up word that has rubbed off on me from Zoy...it can mean anything from  MODED...GROSS...EMBARASSING...FUNNY....HAPPY ... you know.... pretty much every word in the dictionary...so if I say...oh mun.. you look nasty! but I say it with a smile...that's a good nasty...but if I say it with a disgusting face...then it's a bad nasty.... you just got to go with it yeah know?.....hahahhahaha...  anyway....side tracked... the party was fun...and as always the pictures have been posted! and although not all of LNO could make it...I had fairly good buzzed time....but all in all... the girls that didn't go...you suck! I really need to make all of LNO kick it...cuz we haven't done that in a hot minute! oh mun!  oh yeah...i joined www.myspace.com today....it's like an upgrade of Friendster(beta)....it's crazy... cuz you can decorate you're on profile...with all these blinking graphics and all that....there's even a journal thingy on it too! which is cool... but I think I'll stick to BLOGGER! #1 with Blogger! uuaaahh! you can post more pictures... and the profile is a little bit more detailed... but one thing I like about myspace is that it's way FASTER.... definitely an advantage over Friendster.... hahahaha...i'm nasty.  okay...i guess i should start getting ready.

      A blog about Food.  Last night for dinner I made some BOMB ass Korean BBQ....it hella hit the spot....then me and rich left to a seminar....on our way home, around 10ish I'm struck with a craving of McDonald's french fries and some fountain soda to wash it down....but Why??? if i was hungry....why couldn't I just go home and eat leftovers?....me and my cravings...sheesh....so i got home and instead of having just fries and a coke.....i made it a meal and ate a chicken sandwich.....and it was like 1130 at night already....talk about baboy!   Anyway....when Rich and I first met he asked me what was my passion.....off the top of my head I couldn't think of anything...that question stuck to me for a long time...wondering what it is in the world that I can't live without....what I appreciate and yearn for everyday......something that completes my cycle of living.....................................and through time I've come to learn that my passion was FOOD.....although I'd rather have it as not my passion...I can't help it...I love food....all kinds of food....I'm open to everything and anything....there's not anything out there that I'm really grossed out by and just won't eat...... Indian food you ask? I LOVE that stuff.....i mean I have to admit the first time I tried it I was very hesitant.....but I eventually acquired the taste....and now I have my days where I crave the stuff......even the nasty filipino food like balut, bagoong, diniguan (pardon the spelling)..... I can eat it...and will eat it if I want....after all, I am filipino.....when I was young all my parents and grandparents made was filipino food...like the traditional food...the fish and all the vegetables in the asian market...i've tried and ate....and I didn't appreciate it too much cuz we always had it....it would be a freaken celebration for something if we were able to go to McDonald's....but now.....oh mun....I fein for that old school, the way grandma used to make it filipino food......I cook it sure...but there's nothing like the way grandma makes it.... my craves now...i would have to say Vietnamese food.....duh..cuz of Rich....but there's this one place in San Mateo where we ate with his parents....and it was SOOO the B O M B!!! oh mun!!! and then going home to his house and all those noodle dishes, spring rolls, the CRAB (oh mun!) that his mom makes.....nothing like I've ever tasted.... I haven't tried all the food out there that the world has to offer...but believe me.....I'm workin on it.....  I'm hungry. Thank you.

The ambiance was filled with a soothing green color and beautiful fuchsia orchids…..which meant…. PICTURE TIME!!!!!

      Happy Belated MLK everyone!!! The weekend had come…it’s been tooo long since the last time we went snowboarding….(two weeks)…hehehehe….we had to leave Saturday in the early morn…I had the hardest time getting up because silly me got drunk the night before….hehehehe…anyway…I drove up the first half…and it wasn’t too bad after the Venti Caramel Macchiato and its extra shot… *wink  …we stopped midway and had our first meal of the day at Lyon’s which sure hit the spot…and finally hit the mountain around 1130ish? Right? I think so….anyway…the place was packed! We had to park off the side streets! Shhheesh! Anyway, it’s been a while since it snowed so the snow was icy and slushy….and as I was going down the mountain I turned to the left, got on my toes and sighed with relief… I still got it! …although I was still uncomfortable I vowed to spend the day working on my toes and my S’s…I was actually having a pretty good day…no hard falls… So far ..so it’s about the end of the day and we’re ready to go home but J and Rich want to go down one more run so I decide to tag along with them…..so we start going down right….and there’s a semi-flat spot…so I think this is my opportunity to practice my toes and S’s….and so I’m doing well at first right….and all of a sudden when I’m trying to go back on my heels from my toes…. BOOM!!!!  I catch an edge and fall hard…I mean  H  A  R  D   on my hip….and oh mun…….it’s one of those killer falls where it takes you at least 10 seconds to get up….as soon as I hit ground a shocking pain traveled through my right hip towards my backside and up my butt!!!  Oh munnnnnnnnnnnnnnn …it felt like I shattered my tailbone or something…like that prairie dog feeling when you have to go #2 but it’s like a knife tearing through your hole….oh mun….i was in  PAIN!!!!  Anyway…I sucked it up and made it down the hill…the 5 mile walk back to the car was not helping though cuz every time I took a stride there went the prairie knife peeking out again…..you better believe that I didn’t plan to do NOTHING but sit on my ass when we got back to Mel’s…and that’s what I did….I swear I wasn’t going to boarding again the next day…which sucked cuz I knew that MelQ and Justin was there in tahoe planning on boarding with us….anyway….the next morning I wasn’t feeling too bad so I decided to give it a shot and go….so while I was getting ready Melm pops comes in the room and gets herself a pad and I’m like oh great! I’m going to be getting mine soon….and of course…I go to the bathroom and my time of the month has started……whoopee doo for me…..anyway…I still make the most of it and we meet up with Melm, Justin, and Bobby and we’re having a good time…okay okay…I was having a semi-fun time….my ass was hella paranoid of falling again that I wasn’t trying as hard…..I was more  be careful  than  go for it …type attitude...know what I mean??...anyway…so as you know it was my first day of that time in the month so you better believe that I started feeling the bloatedness, the achiness, and the sensitivity arising…..so when Rich would speed off ahead of me and not be there waiting when I thought I caught up….made me feel really butthurt…so 2:00pm starts rolling around and we know that we’ll be leaving soon so time for our final run….and this time Rich…taking into consideration my “sensitivity” stayed with me…..and I had a DOPE run!!!! Felt much more comfortable toeing it and heeling it and toeing it and heeling it….great way to end the weekend……  Here’s the pictures guys… urlLink Snowboarding again ...

      Last Saturday was my parents 5 year death anniversary...and what I thought would be a sad weekend became one of the dopest weekends I've had this year!!!! .....although this last weekend was the first weekend of the year.....hehehheehehe......the drive up Friday could have been better...talk about going literally 10-15mph up the summit....taking us 2 hours when it should of taken us only 15 minutes....oh well...me and rich had our fair share of quality time in the car thanks to our CDs, "Chillen", "More Slow Jams", and "Jack Johnson"....and thanks to the handy ice scraper from the dollar store!!! Helped a lot with the windshield wipers...good call Rich Meister!!!  That night, the Maynigo house was packed....Around 230ish in the morning....Rose, Gilbert, Glenn, and Melissa finally arrived to pick up the keys to their hotel.....and the rest of us finally called it a night around 3ish...Sleeping peacefully, Rich, Jeremy, Missa, Brittnie, Merianne, Melanie, Edsel, Rey, and Auntie Gingging and Uncle Achey kept the house warm with their deep breaths while I tossed and turned on the uncomfortable air mattress.... oh mun!!! We'll be waking up at 7am to go snowboarding! I need my rest!   was what I thought as I sat up to fluff up my pillow....4am rolled by...the grandfather clock rang  DING! DONG! DING! DONG! ......I closed my eyes and relaxed my body... go to bed  I said...as soon as I thought I was falling asleep I hear a crack in the house which causes me to become wide awake...I look at the clock and it reads: 4:04am...... FRICKEN A!!!  BLAH BLAH BLAH....so that's how the story went till about 7:30am when Jeremy got up and was folding his blanket when  BOOM ...his big ogre head hit the lamp and broke the light bulb......HAHAHAHHAHAH.....so no sleep for me that night.... anyway...the house turns from their deep slumber into a house of rawkus....everyone getting ready for a fun filled day at Sierra!!!! The storm was out of the way and the skies was filled with nothing but beautiful BLUE....not a cloud in the sky and the grounds full of fluffy white powder.....and although I didn't get any sleep the night before I was ready for the day.....the LA folks met up with us at the Maynigo's and by 8:30am we were off to McDonald's for breakfast....after a nice hearty meal....we went straight to Sierra....at least tried to go straight to Sierra....Pioneer Trail was TRAFFFFIIICCC!!! It was sooo dead slow that Mel and I were able to get out of the car to take pictures in the snow....but we finally reached Sierra at 11ish....during that time I was able to sleep at least.... anyway....our first run: straight to the top of the mountain....we had SOOO much fun...I can't even describe how much fun we all had...there was 9 of us boarding down the hill at one time...stopping to take pictures...stopping to fall...stopping on the toes...on the heels...face first in the snow...oh mun...hardcore fall for me on the first run.....oh well...i didn't care....if anyone was to fall at all....this day was the best time to fall....i think everyone looked forward to falling cuz you just didn't feel a thing.....oh mun....it was sooo dope....anyway...i haven't even gotten to my favorite part yet....... so the second run comes...and ed's leading the group....and me and Brit are partnering the whole way and we're telling each other we have to practice our S's...here's our song: Brittnie and Christine are snowboarding again, Brittnie and Christine are snowboarding again, and we're going to practice our S's again and we're not going to fall again, Brittnie and Christine are snowboarding again!!!!  and so we are, right....and all of a sudden....I shift my hips to the left and you know what!!! I'm on my  TOES !!!! and then i shift to the right...and i'm on my  HEELS !!! and I go back on my TOES and I'm on my Toes veering to the left...then veering to the right..... OMIGOOOODDDDD!!! I'm Doing It!! I'm Doing IT!!!  I did multiple S's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mun.... I was soo  excited ...and the mushy sappy sucker that I am  turned around hoping that Rich was right behind me cheesing as heck to see me doing it and yelling,  GO BABE!! ...but he wasn't.....oh well.......but you better believe that when I did see him I told him to stay where he was and watch me....and he did....and he did say  GO BABE!!!! I'm SOO proud of you! ....and now that I got that down I definitely have a whole new outlook on boarding....I didn't get as tired as easily and I was complaining about my knees as much AND most of all....I wasn't always the last one at the bottom of the hill.....I can't WAIT to go again.....SERIOUSLY....oh yeah by the way...don't mean to gloat...but  MY  boyfriend cleared a 50 foot cliff....huh babe??? hehehhe just kidding it was 15 feet..........but next trip: Martin Luther King Weekend!! Wwwwwooooo HOoooooOOOoOOO!!! Can't FUHREAKEN wait!!!! Anyway we finally stopped boarding at the very very last minute...I mean we were having soo much fun that we forgot to take a lunch break....can you tell how much fun we had or what? anyhow....all that fun I had at the resort and my lack of sleep put a great number on my body....cuz I was freaken zombied out when we got home....I couldn't even move....it's the type of fatigue where you're so tired that you can't even sleep....like you know you should cuz you know you need it...but you just can't....so I ate....and ate...and ate...I ate a lot....mel's family was over for mel's birthday....all of us there...the food...the exciting day snowboarding made Mel's birthday extra special this year...don't yah think Mel??? But that wasn't the end of Mel's night....after opening presents and taking a shot of hypnotiq each....we all headed over to the Casinos.....I was rolling on the Black Jack Table at Bill's......went in with $20....left the table with $130!!!! oh yeah baby!! big ballen now!!! and when we found Mel....she was drunk...Ed had fed her with a couple shots and a mixed drink....and from then on Mel said nothing but,  Thank you guys! Thank you guys for coming! OooooohhhH!! I love you soo much! I love everyone so much!!! .... hahahhahahaha!!! after the casinos we headed over to Club Altitude!!!! Thanks mel for the group rate!!! Trance for a good hour and then finally some hip hop...we thought the guys would be amused by the cage dancers or even the topless ones...but it seemed that they were more disgusted than amused....but Gilbert did say that he liked the girl to the right.... Even if they are fake...they still look hot! .....HAAHHAHAHAHA... We  FINALLY  got home around 330am...and by 345am the house was filled with sounds of Mel's yakking in the bathroom and then in the kitchen.....Audrey helped put her hair up.....Audrey, how do you know the process of taking care of someone who's drunk????.....and Mel complained about the smell of her breath.... Yakk ....my breath stinks!.... Yakkk ....HAHAHahaahHAHha! I've never met anyone who was concerned about how their breath smelled like DURING yaking.....HAhahahaahh!  HAPPY BIRTHDAY MEL!!!  I love you!!! You are Fuhreaken OLD!!! Anyway....we had breakfast with the LA folks at the IHOP before they left, headed over to Sport LTD...or is it LTD sports....and went home to relax before we left....one of the highlights of Sunday...Audrey, Brit, and Chelsea made songs for all of us....you wanna hear me and Richs'???    Rich and Christine are in love....Rich and Christine are in love....Rich sells wood....Christine does....NOT....Rich and Christine are in love...Rich and Christine are in love...they love to kiss and hug and cuddle a lot...Rich and Christine are in love....Rich and Christine are in love...I'm sorry babe, I love you....SUPERSTAR!!!!   Oh mun! it was sooo cute! Sorry if I messed it up a little...but for the most part it should be right....thanks for the song cuties...it was awesome!!!   anyway...it's been 5 years since my parents passing...and I just want to take this time to tell them:  Mom and Dad, there is not a day that goes by that we don't think of you, wish that you were here, hope to see or talk to you again....it amazes me how long it has been when it feels like just yesterday I was looking at your faces smiling back at me....and although we miss you desperately....it gives us satisfaction that during the time that you were here with us you taught me, jen, and chris the strength, confidence, patience, and inspiration to live our life fully and successfully....so there's nothing to worry about mom and dad because as you look down at us that's exactly what we've come to be....thank you for all that you've done....and all that matters now is that you both are happy and at peace with God....we love you with all our hearts......see you later!     okay enough of my jibber jabber....I know yall want the pictures....sorry there's not as many as usual....but at least you can see the pictures of the SUNNY day and be   urlLink JEALOUS!!!

After the scrumptous dinner we headed over to poppen Club Whisper....or at least we hoped it would be poppen...tix were $35 a pop...cuz the Galleria was sold out.....oh mun...so bummed about that one...but we thought to make the best of the night by getting crazy drunk and enjoying the company that we were with. We got there...and just as Rich had expected...Asian Nation up the asss....so our first drink: a triple shot of hennessy! I actually just took 2 1/2 while Rich finished the other half.....our countdown sucked as hell cuz we were outside on the patio and the countdown wasn't announced over the loud speaker on the patio...so we all kinda had to look at our watches, phones and just guess if it was midnight.....WEAK!!!!!!! but like I said...I had hella fun regardless......MelQ, Justin, and babe...thanks for a wonderful New years!!!

      Okay….Pleasure Party 2 was nothing like Pleasure Party 1….all the alcohol that all of LNO contributed PLUS a freaken HUGE bottle of hen…what…it was like 3/5ths right? PLUS all the other contributions that guests brought equaled a whole lotta alcohol = to a whole lotta CRUNKed ass people….and I was one of them…  And you woulda thought that I had a great time too being drunk and all…but really it was just aight..me and nette had to spend most of the night trying to regulate people cuz some folks were just getting way too out of hand…and then more folks showed up and it was all a question of whether or not we knew all these people…and it being my party BUT not MY house made it really hard to tell people they couldn’t come in or had to leave….  But all in all it was great having all the girls together cuz it had been a long time since all of LNO got together….and we were all Dee-runk!!! Hehehe…  Next time the party will be planned and prepared better….  Enjoy the pictures yall!!!   urlLink Pleasure Party Part Deuce

      Okay okay….we’re back from VIVA LAS VEGAS right….and I’m still sick…I got sick the Tuesday we were leaving…and it just wasn’t the sniffles and the coughs…it was the headaches and the back pains and the dizziness and the nausea and all of that….and you better believe that I was trying to fight it off with everything that I could so that I wouldn’t have to go to Vegas as sick as I was…unfortunately it didn’t go away…..and on top of that….Rizzi was sick too………oh mun…. So here’s my story…   Our Las Vegas Trip….     Thursday, February 26, 2004    1.  Me, Zoy, and Rizzi depart from SJC at 840pm and arrive in VEGAS at 1000pm  2.  We met up with Nette (cuz she took a different flight) and we were on our way to Monte Carlo Resort & Casinowhere we stayed….  3.  So we arrived…and me and Lot (rizzi) went to go check-in…. and we decide to go ahead and pay cash up front and when the lady tells us its going to be $517 total… we’re like what the heck?? ....Las Vegas.com quoted us $449!… so she researched it and called it in…..and after waiting for almost an hour she tells us that the inside lady must’ve messed up somehow cuz our new rate was $350!!!! We’re like woo hooo!!! $100 was added to our *vegas fund! That was HOOK-UP  #1!!!   * - To ensure that all of us had spending money here in vegas we collected $20 from each other every other week to pay for our hotel, meals, and what not…it came out to be $160/person   4.  After Melm arrives to the hotel a little later...since her flight arrived a couple hours after us...The girls and I honestly didn’t know what we wanted to do this night…but one thing was for sure….we were HUNGRY! So we set off to NYNY to find some grubben….after eating at the American Restaurant which the LNO fund paid for… it was about 2:30am and I was just too exhausted and sick to go anywhere else…so instead of looking for a bar or whatever....we all just decided to go back to the hotel and rest up for Friday….    Friday, February 27, 2004    1.  We were all up early this morning to site see with Nette since it was her first time in Vegas… and while Lot and Melm finished getting ready in the room ... laggers! …me, zoy, and nette went downstairs to win us some money!  2.  So nette brings us to the roulette table…and I’m like hella iffy cuz I’ve only played Roulette once in my life and I ended up losing $200 there before….so I was unsure of what to do…. But I play anyway…what the heck….I play on colors first while nette and zoy placed their chips randomly throughout the board… I didn’t know what the heck they were doing but oh well…I played $40 and within the next 10 minutes or so I was down to my last $10… sheesh ...the colors were obviously not working for me….so I played the numbers….and by the time I was done there I came up $205 not including the $40 I first started playing with…WOO HOO for me!!!  3.  Out to the strip we went…and it was windy cold but the sun was shining bright and there wasn’t too many clouds in the sky….we did a lot of picture taking during this time…and was hungry once again…  4.  Off to the Mirage Buffet! It was lunch time so it cost only $13.50/person…which again the LNO fund paid for….this was bonding moment time with the girls and it was really nice to update each other with everything that’s been going on and whatnot…..but by the end of the meal…I was NOT feeling any better….I started feeling nauseated and tired…..so we left the buffet….and I’m thinking maybe I need some fresh air….but as soon as we start moving on…I turn right back around to the bathroom….and everything that was delicious to eat at the buffet…came right back out………..i straight yacked everything……..mun!!!!!!! I was so disappointed that my vacation was not going as planned…..so me and lot decided to go back to the hotel and rest up before we went clubben this night…and that’s what we did…from about 3ish – 6ish…me and rizzi slept….in our rooms….while the other girls went to site-see some more…….. SUCKED!   5.  well 6:30 rolls by and I’m like, " f this we are leaving our hotel"…and since I threw up everything earlier and still was not hungry…I got some McDonald’s….I had about 5 french fries and I was done…  6.  Me and Rizzi walked over to Aladdin to meet up with the girls and Nette is drunk full of free alcohol from the casino tables…. lucky ass!!! .........anyway...we head on over to Paris to do more gambling….and I’m feeling a wee bit better…. So we hit another Roulette table…. I’m actually doing pretty good here…losing a little...winning a little more….and I’m hella sweating….hella sweating….and before you know it…it’s 9 o’clock…..time to go back to the hotel and change for the evening’s adventures….and you know what?….I’m feeling  A LOT  better….  7.  We’re all ready by 10:00pm…we meet up with Romeo (who just so happened to be working there for the week)…. And left for MGM Grand to meet up with Mel’s cousins….I decided to stay sober this night so I wouldn’t make my illness any worse…and hopefully recover by the next morning….while the other’s got drunk at Fat Tuesday…taking Everclear jello shots, Everclear cherry bombs, Everclear  EVERYTHING …which by the way was band out of California because it was TOOO strong…grosss!!! After ...we were off to Studio 54…led by some dumbass who thought he was the ish saying that he could get all of us in for FREE cuz he was VIP everywhere…but by the time we got there….he got rejected…meaning all of us were rejected….. pssssshh!!! what fuh-reaken ever!!! Hook up my ass!  So we left to party at the OPM at Ceasar’s Palace…  8.  So we're at OPM with our free passes…….. from our taxi driver who we  thought  was hooking us up…….even though the passes actually expired at 1230am when it was already 130am…. Mun! Luckily Mel’s cute ass cousin Ella went to the bouncer and was able to hook us all up for free….woo hoo!!! HOOK-UP #2! Although I was sober this night I hella made sure to make the most of it so I danced…danced hard core…remember that huge ass space that Joy and I usually need to dance with? Well this night her drunk ass and my sober one used up twice that size …. They were playing some tight ass music including our Reggae…hhhheeeyyy!!!    9.  By 330am….my feet was thr-O-bbing….instead of being practical…my dumbass decided to wear these high open toe shoes when I could of worn my comfortable padded boots…..i took off my shoes on the bench outside the club and there was straight strap impressions all over my feet…nasty! And you know what? Zoy saw how uncomfortable I was and decided to trade her comfortable flatter sandals with mine…. oh mun! Thanks zoy!!!  Now that’s what I’m talking about when I say we hella always have each other’s back….and as we walked back to the car…Nette heard a  crack ….oh mun!!! She had broken her heel!!!!!! Hahahah!!! Drunk ass!!!  10.  So we finally get back to the hotel….while melm stayed behind to party on with her cousins….we called our boyfriends…..ordered some room service and ate…and yes my appetite was back…and then we passed out….    Saturday, February 28, 2004    1.  I am feeling SOO much better today!!!  Woo hooo!!!   2.  We decided to sleep in a little longer this day so we can prep for our big Saturday night out…we got out of the hotel close to 2:00pm and had lunch with Mel and her relatives at a Korean BBQ restaurant….yummy!... and Auntie paid for lunch…thanks Auntie!!! HOOK-UP #3!  3.  After we did the usual site seeing….we headed over to Harrah’s to do some more gambling!!! And I came up with more money! Woo hoo!!!  4.  After Harrah's, one thing that Nenette needed to do before the weekend ended was ride at least 1 rollercoaster…so we finally did…we went over to Sahara’s where they had one of the best rides in Vegas…$10/person…but it was so well worth it to say that we rode a rollercoaster in Vegas….  5.  By 8 o’clock it was time for us to head back over to the hotel to prep for our Ladies Night Out…and when I say Ladies…I meant  Ladies only ….our affair for the night….. CHIPPENDALE’s The Show!!! ... oh hell yeah were we excited!!! And we were  ALL  looking fly!!! Woo hoo!!!...thanks mel for the 2 for 1 tickets…which LNO paid for…we were practically last in line…so when we finally got in…there was no seats left…but Ella was able to talk to one of the HOT ushers..Mr. Steve Kim….oh mun was he fine!!!! ….. who hooked us up in the VIP area right in the center.. HOOK UP #4!!!... The waitress hooked us up with our drinks…cuz yes…we were ALL planning to get fucked up….the lights dimmed  and the show began….men here..men there…dancing…stripping…bouncing…humping….all the works…and yes…we were all there to witness it and treat them like pieces of meat….cuz that’s exactly what they were…. Hahahhaaha….   6.  After the show…we headed over to the bathroom to release all the alcohol that filled our bladders…. In line we met an older woman who claimed to have climaxed 5 times during the show…oh mun! talk about too much information!  Sheesh!!  And then after the bathroom…of course we took hella pictures…a couple of them with that same older woman who started blurting out that she was hella horny and hella wanted to be with a girl at that moment...and she wanted to eat some you know what…oh mun! oh mun!  waaayyy  too much information for us….you better believe we ran from her!!! Hahahahah  7.  After that fiasco…. We just so happened to run into the Chippendale guys…oh mun….talk about gorgeous! And you can tell by the pictures how many we took… we were going to go to the club they were going to but already had plans to meet up with Mel’s other cousins….   8.  So after an hour and a half of taking pictures and major flirting with the guys we left to have some Japanese food….there was a whole bunch of Mel’s family already there plus her nephew Matthew and her newborn niece….Matthew was just soooo cute!!! Hella bonding and flirting with all the girls…kissing all of us and hugging….oh mun…just too adorable… Anyway…after much chillen and sake bombs and hella picture taking…my memory space was full..and had to expire my camera for the night… sucked! …but at least we were pretty wasted… and still it wasn’t the end of the night….we were headed to Venus at the Venetian….  9.  Thanks to JD we were able to get into Venus for free!!! HOOK UP #5!!! Thanks JD!!! Now Venus was DMX’s club…so he was there too….although I didn’t see him…and Rizzi told me that Brittany Spears was there too!!!! Cuz her concert’s at MGM the weekend after…and if I wasn’t too drunk I would’ve walked around to look for her….anyway…. as soon as we entered….Joy looked at me with this sick ass face and said, “I need to use the bathroom”…and just like she had my back when my feet was terribly hurting…I had hers…so off to the bathroom we go….and we’re in line…and Joy’s trying so hard to hold it…and even the bathroom attendant saw Joy’s sick face and knew…so she pulled out the trash…and BAM…. yackkkkkkk!!!!!!!!!!!  It’s cool Joy…just let it all out… heheheheh… okay…don’t want to embarrass her more than I already have…all I got to say is that she was FUCKED up!! Woo hooo!!!! We stayed at Venus for a couple more hours and danced our asses off…and finally…I mean FINALLY went home…it was about 5am….   NOW THAT’s HOW A NIGHT IN VEGAS IS SUPPOSE TO BE LIKE!!!   Woo hoo!!! I can’t even emphasize enough how much fun we had…     Sunday, February 29, 2004    1.  We wake up at 9am and pack our stuff and check out at 1100am…  2.  We say goodbye to Nette cuz her flight is at 1230pm and me and mel go checkout…as we checkout we see the agent calculating some numbers…I’m thinking in the back of my head… oh mun…I know we don’t owe anything more …and then she says, “It looks like we owe you some money.” And my eyebrows go up and I look at Mel…and we’re both thinking…yeahh!!! So she gives us back $75! Woo hoo!!! HOOK UP #6!...so instead of the original $449 that we were quoted for originally…we ended up paying $275 for 3 nights at the Monte Carlo….. hook up or what!!    3.  Anyway….we decided to gamble the money and if we won then we would split it and if we didn’t…then oh well….so we say goodbye to mel cuz her flight leaves at 1100 that night and was getting picked up by her cousins….and me, riz, and zoy check in our luggage at concierge and take one last walk on the strip….  4.  The weather is bright, sunny, and warm…no wind or clouds at all….we hit the Bellagio and it just so happens that the water show was going to begin….*sigh…beautiful…totally amazing….Sorry nette! I know you hella wanted to watch the show…sorry you couldn’t see it! At least now you could see it through Lot’s camera… hehhehehehehe…we tried taking pictures like Ocean’s 11…with us facing Bellagio and our backs towards the camera…but the guy who took the picture didn’t know what the hell Ocean’s 11 was…so he messed it up…  weak!!  Hehehehe….  5.  We finally hit Ceasar’s Palace….ate there…shopped for some souvenirs….and decided after the taxi cab fares that we would gamble the money that we got back from the hotel....so at the Roulette table Joy places a 20 on the 3rd 12....there was still 20 dollars left to play and I tell her to go ahead and put it all down...the dealer spins the ball...and bam....we win $120!!!!...after that...we leave..... happy to have made $20 each for all of us…  6. By this time we were all just exhausted and wanted to leave….and so we did…  *sigh…so that’s the end of our Vegas trip….I actually talked to the girls on Monday…and none of us..none of us... wanted to get back to reality….Vegas was awesome….everything we did…and although I was sick for a part of it…I am soo happy that I went… Being with my girls this weekend made me realize how lucky I am to have such wonderful girlfriends in my life…it made me appreciate friendship and life all together…I’m really lucky to be able to  experience these trips, the memories, the pictures, the moments with my best friends….no matter how long I’ve known them….they really are a part of who I am…cuz who I am is because of them…. Thanks for such a dope ass weekend…I mean  DOPE …I cannot emphasize it enough… and to the rest of the other girls that weren’t able to make it…next time ladies…next time…. Okay…so yall are all anxious to see the pictures….. so here we go…  PICTURES!!!   urlLink Christine’s camera  – the bulk of the vacation until Saturday night  urlLink Rizzi’s camera  – Saturday and Sunday  urlLink Joy’s camera  - Friday and Saturday Mel’s camera –  coming soon!

      dayam! it's been so long since I've blogged...and I can see that blogger has made some nice changes...props to yalls for the upgrades... so what have I been up to?  The semesters finally over...and because of my hard work I can finally party hard during the summer! well...um...actually not really...i'm currently looking for a job...my unemployment has run out and gawd only knows that I can't be living my wake up at 11 in the morning for one class a day then home by 2pm life anymore...it just ain't cutten in yah feel? So if thinks work out the way I hope then I'll be working once again...AND going to school at the same time...no more messing around...i have to make my sacrifices and if that means having to cut out my party life...so be it..shooot...and as you can tell from all my ofoto albums...i definitely haven't deprived myself from that anyway. But before any that seriousness begins....HAWAII is coming up in about 2 weeks...yall don't EVEN know how excited I am! I've never been there before so hell yes sleeping is definitely not on my agenda...what is on my agenda? 1. taking MAD pictures 2. getting alllll wet! oh yeah baby! 3. getting Kee-RUNK!! 4. taking more pictures! 5. spending time with the folks and the happy newlyweds!  I've been waiting for this trip for a long time and I've busted my ass working out at least 3 times a week, lifting weights, cardio, and of course shaking my ass to the tahitian drums in the INTERMEDIATE class now! woo hoo! solo competition here I come! ha! yeah right... anyway...what else have I been up to? I'll be moving soon...again...I just can't afford living it like this anymore...if I want to live successful you've got to make the sacrifices first...so no more plush upscale apartment...see? did you see what I just wrote? "Plush upscale apartment"...now what's wrong with that phrase? The word "apartment" is whats wrong...why live in an apartment when you could be living in your home right? Right.....So we're moving someone in and moving to a different place...gonna be saving us more cash towards our own place in the very very near future. But that's been what's going on with me...nothing too exciting I guess... Pish out and until next time!  PS>>>>> MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND IN LA PICTURES  coming soon .....

      I'm baccccckkkk!! Maui was just off the hook...we had hella fun! I'm hella dark and hella bit from the bugs...you swear I went to the PI...but it was all worth it...I did everything..I think almost everything that you should do the first time in the islands...   1. hit the beach (duh!) 2. boogie boarding 3. surfing  ----------thanks to maui waverunners i was able to catch some baby waves...  4. snorkeling  ----------we first went on our own to a spot along the lava rocks called fish bowl..or at least what we thought was fish bowl...we got lost of course....found another cove that definitely didn't look like fish bowl at all...but amazingly the cove was filled with hella fish...i mean hella! it was gorgeous! I have no complaints at all...we called the new spot we found, "the lost Bowl"....then on sunday we went on a snorkeling tour that took us to Turtle town..although we didn't see too much at all except for one turtle...that was awesome...then headed over to the Molokini crater...the waters in there was gorgeous...true blue as if you were in a swimming pool...we didn't see as much fish as we thought....the lost bowl is definitely ranked #1 in my book...  5. go to a luau  ----------the luau we went to was PHAT...it was just hella nice...open bar with mai tai's and my drunk drink Long Beach...I was pretty buzzed one hour into the luau! hahah..and so was rich...chris fell in love with one of the dancers...the food was jammin! i definitely think it was worth the money we paid for...  6. sight seeing on the Hana Highway  ----------there was sooo many places to see...this part of the island was the rainforest area...full of hidden sights, waterfalls, caves, etc...you'd probably need a full 2 days there to see everything that it offers...we hit up Ching's Pool (was that what it was called?) where some of the guys dove off a cliff...it started raining hard so we were off to the next area....Blue Pool was awesome!! I mean straight paradise! This waterfall off the ocean coast with it's pool...totally amazing...and then our last stop was at the black sands beach...took pictures on the lava rocks and of the lava arches...went to the caves that had freshwater pools to swim in...and then went home...  7. visit the nude beach  ----------hahahah..just kidding...rich and I was on the Big Beach in Makena and we heard that there was a nude beach just over the hill...so we walk there to check it out...we peep to the side and rich tells me that he sees people in swimsuits and we figure we must've been misinformed....so we go....and BAM...naked people! aaaagghh!!! and they're not cute (of course they're not)...we felt too embarrased to turn around and head back cuz it looked like all of them seemed to be looking at us...so we went straight through and tried not to stare...didn't want them to get the wrong idea...hahhaa...and went around the back back back area....dude...people were just all nude...no shame hidden in the faces at all...their kids running around...as if no one was naked at all...well it's cool...whatever makes them happy right? it sure didn't feel right to us...so we shook QUICK....   i'm taking forever to blog...so here are the pictures...enjoy people! maui ROCKS!!!   **** urlLink Album 1 **** **** urlLink Album 2 **** **** urlLink Album 3 ****

      President Reagan's funeral is today...  which just makes me realize how fast time flies...I remembered Pres. Reagan because he had such a friendly smile..i remember wishing that he would be my grandpa...hahaha..  do you remember what you were doing when he was president? Serving 2 terms from 1981 - 1989....he was my president the first 8 years of my life! dang! hahaha! i remember living in San Francisco...my parents, sister, and I lived with my grandparents and my dad's youngest sister and brother...and two houses next to ours lived my uncle roger, auntie maggie, and their daughter sylvia ...and right across the street from them lived my auntie norma, uncle david and their kids....it was dope...family parties everyday...my family used to ALWAYS play bets on football....and with their winnings from that my dad was able to buy my grandparents a new TV and of course save up for our own house...  and then we moved to fremont...started school here...had my first crush...i remember his name too..Martin Seranno...hahahah! but he never liked me...then again he never knew i liked him either...hella modes.......my uncle jun lived with us...he bought a pool table and taught me how to play...he taught me well i think...i ain't no professional...i barely play...but i still remember how he taught me to play....he even taught me chess...he still plays...have you ever been on market? where all the chess players play out on the street? he plays there sometimes...i never was too fond of chess.... and then my moms parents came from the Philippines...they were hella strict! Stuck with their old school filipino ways...me and my sister would wish every night that they'd go back to the PI...hahah...hella messed up I know...but you know how it is...my grandma taught me a lot though...she taught me the star spangled banner! hahaha...ironic isn't it? coming from the PI and all...she's why I'm so organized with my closet now...and you know what was hella cool too? she never had white hair...just true black...no dye no nothing...my grandpa always kept to himself...he was sick most of the time...but when he'd get mad he'd hella get mad....mun...  I remember elementary school too...i was such a kiss ass too my teachers! hahha! whatever it takes to get the A right? hahah..just kidding...i didn't have to kiss ass...i was already smart...hhahah! i remember being sick and thinking i was well enough to go to school...during the first recess we were playing four square and all of sudden my head started spinning...and i yacked! hard core! on the 4-square court...hahah! so i went to the nurse's office and she wanted to take my temp before she called my parents to pick me up...like she didn't think i was sick enough after throwing up on the court! duh! well right when she stuck that thermometer in my mouth...i yacked...and on her skirt too! oh mun!   it was just so easy being a kid...even high school...so easy...never had to worry about anything...i think the only thing i stressed about was what to say to my dad to let me go out...or what to say to my mom to go out...or just to go out in general...  okay...enough of the reminiscing.... HAWAII in 6 DAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!! woooo hoooo beeeaattcchh!
