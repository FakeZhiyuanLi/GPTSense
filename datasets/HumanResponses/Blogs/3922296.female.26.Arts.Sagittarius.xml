      So maybe I should give a little more background info on myself and more importantly,  my motivations . After reading back the previous post, I can see how someone could very easily think I'm a psycho stalker who wants to  reclaim my man  or something equally insane.  Lately, many very strange things have happened, that have worn me out. My father has become very ill. I am not altogether well myself. We moved — and yes, I do have a boyfriend. I love him very much and hope (very quietly) to marry him someday. I just feel like life is very  fragile  lately. And I feel like there really aren't many people I've intentionally hurt. But David is one of them. And also, the only one I can't reach. Maybe it's some kind of nervous breakdown. Maybe it's unhealthy. But my need to apologise is very real. And acute.  I don't remember the last words we exchanged, but I think my last statement to him was something along the line of  YOU EXASPERATE ME . Quite honestly, he  did , but that doesn't mean it was  intentional from his side  or that he deserved to be treated with disrespect by me.  Anyway: Unhealthy or no, this is the internet! It is huge! Somebody  must know David ! Which is my motivation. I would just like to say that I am really sorry, and I would like to see that his life is brilliant.

       Good people out there — I need your help.   In 1998 and 1999 I knew an Irish guy named David. He was medium tall, darkhaired, freckled and had green eyes. He lived in county Cork. He worked at a Greyhound track, and studied to be an accountant. I fell in love with this guy. We exchanged thousands of emails. Sometimes more than twenty a day. We promised to see each other in summer. And then we actually  did .  Unfortunately, after that things went wrong. Distance is never kind to lovers, and it certainly wasn't to us. We went our separate ways — first with no hard feelings, attempting to be friends. Then, no contact at all. I am afraid, dear reader, that this was all my fault. And I would really like to apologise to David, as he didn't deserve to be treated like I treated him. However: In order to say I'm sorry, I will need to find him first. And I don't know where he is. Maybe, though, you do? Or maybe if you don't, someone you know does? Please pass this on and help me find him.  What I know: His name is  David John Holland . He is Irish. When I last heard from him, he worked for the Bank of Ireland and lived in Dublin. He has a son, I believe about four or five years old now. His name is possibly Michael, named for Michael Schumacher, but also for his grandfather. He has a younger brother whom I think is named James. He likes the Beatles, Formula 1 and if I remember correctly, his favourite football team is Blackburn.   Do you know him? Please let me know how I can reach him. I need your help. Thank you.
