       I changed the name of Summer Romp to Jones' 18th B-day, and the second summer romp has become the first, and now  only,  summer romp. Not too confusing.    Okay, that's all for the photo gallery updates for a while. Oh yeah, and can whoever started this thing put a link to  urlLink  my  blog  on here? It just bothers me, is all.

        Those who wish to obtain the picture code would be wise to check out the comments of the last post.   As for this blog, I suggest that we use it for trivia and other random crap like that. Since no one will protest, I will start it off with some Simpsons trivia.   I'll start with an easy one.  Who shot Mr. Burns?

        i guess this serves... some  inane purpose to someone...   I can't offer much in terms of MEAT to this group blog dealy, but I can offer the code I use to put that pic on my posts to people for their own use (and obviously, their own pics)...is anyone interested?

       Okay, so maybe Rob and Andy were bad ideas (they'd never do it), but other people, IE Czank, Benny, etc. etc. The thinking behind this is that maybe with more people, we can actually find a real  purpose  to this thing.  Oh, and as for the Photo Gallery, well...too bad.

      yes, yes, yes, i haven't updated in like 3 days...but thats cause of one reason.....i didn't to, and frankly, i forgot what happened in those three days.  Fucking Crazy.   Ok, so yeah, on to some intresting reading about myself to entertain all 5 of you who acutally read this (thnx by the way).  I woke up at 5:30 this morning from another dream.....but this one was one of those crazy intriguing ones.  In the dream, i ask out Claudia to a club, and i end up meeting her at a Blug called "Seven".....ya, i think thats a cool name too, but anway, then there's sabby playing cards in sunglasses saying you have to pay extra if you want to play with sunglasses....i say something along the lines of "what a "rip-off" or something like that.  Well, i start going in, and i go into different rooms, and everytime i go into one, it switches to a overhead shot of the place i'm at, and three chicks, on is on a gurny, and the other 2 are helping her out.  Anyway, if i remember correctly, the first room was a "COlloseum" style room, kinda like an ampitheater.  I explore it for alittle bit, then get out of the room.  I'm like "i wonder where She is" or something like that, then, go into the next room.  This room is kinda like a sand floor, and had some statue or rock crashed into it, but it's still all very calm, then i belive i juss had like, rushes of thought surge through my head (that happens soooooo much). um, then, it goes back to the 3 chicks, cept this time, there having sex, and, it's like awsome.  It goes back to me, opening a door, to the very room there in, and then it goes to one of those weird angles again, then i wake up....i was like "whoa".  Well, ya, i'm pretty sure it went like that, prolly not EXACTLY like it, but close enough....anyway, i once again try to go back to sleep, but to no success...i can;t stop thinking, thats my problem.  I''m not saying i'm smart...thats the LAST thing i am, i'm juss saying that i'm always thinking...i think about everything! before i know i'm going to meet someone, i always think about EVERY senario possible to be prepared, why i'm listening to music, i'm relating lyrics to events in my life, then, at the same time, think  of those moments, and how they made me feel, and how that's been either a good or bad expierince.  I'm porlly not the only one, but if i am...crazy.  I also think all this thinking has hightened my imagination, and mental "imaging"  Like literally, i can close my eyes, and like, recreate everything in my mind, and like, it's as clear as day to me, almost as if i still had my eyes open, it's sooo awsome..once again, i'm sure one of you are gonna IM me or something saying you have the same thing, but i doubt it....i dunno....for some reason, i'm feeling very....religious? I dunno, i juss wonder to myself what i'm on this earth to do.  As i explained in the previous entry, Sylviz Browne cahnge my life, and views on almost everything.   Now, while were on that subject, i think it's safe to explain something about me.....what most of you know is "me", really is me, but there's also the other parts of me, my beliefs, my opinions, my actions that many of you don't see....My views on almost everything is complicated....i know all this is making you say "everyone is like that" but i'm juss saying that, cause i want to let everyone know (if they haven't picked it up) that i'm a seriously DEEP person, even though i don't/hardly show it.  well, ya, now that thats done.....sorry abou tthat...it's like 12:22, and alot of shit happned, lemme tell ya.  School went as usual, first period was cool, we did the whole   urlLink Walkabout  program presentations and everythingm that was pretty cool, i signed up for that thing for the next meeting....i'm not sure if i'm gonna do it yet, but we'll see.  2nd i had off, in which i played "mow mow" or somethign like that....it's this German card game Andy mentally imported from...well, germany.  We played for awhile (most of the period) and i listen to much disco on da I-Pod.  I noticed maylene looking over, like always...and, like always, i never respond back to her.....i feel like shit for not doing anything.  Like, i hate it when you think NO ONE thinks anything of your, or thinks bad of you, but then when you find out they do, and they say it, wait, nevermind, i'm confusing myself, let me start over with an example.  In eigth grade, there was this new girl, Nicole...she was fairly tall, and a good freind of Me, sabby, and apparently Katie and CArly Nalven.  Anyway, i think i was talking to her, about a crush she used to have on me, and i was like "lol, wow, i didn't know that'" and all that eigth grade shit, but then she told me something that totally hit me like a ton-a-bricks.  She says "i was like one of the hardest guys to get with"...and like, it's not because of the fact that she liked me, and coulnd't get me, but because her freinds told her that.  Like, they all said "i was on of the hardest guys to get with in school"  Do u get the felling behind that? it's hard to explain....even ahrder to type, but it's one of those "wow, i never really knew i was considered like that" thing.  Not a bad thing, juss one of those kinda pleasently suprised thing.  well, ya, that.  So ya, might as well explain my History with maylene....if you want to all it that.  In about..i'd say, 5th grade, my older brother, and HEr oldest brothers were best friends.  Anyway, since we went to the same school, once in a while we'd go in the same car, and stuff, but i was the new kid in 5th grade...and very shy, so i always try to ignore her and shit.  Well, that kinda happens alot throughout the year, i remmebr once we dropped her off at The twins' house.  Well, ya, then like, acouple of months down after that, i get a call right when i get outa the shower.  It's a girl, and she's gigling.  She says "Alexa Irish Likes you" and i was like "who the fuck is that?" and i yadda yadda yadda, i hank up.  For as long as i remember, i was trying to look for alexa irish....i had NO idea who this girl was, but i had to see her, it was my mission.  I was the new kid, and to have someone like me was incredible....well, turns out, i've seen her many-a-time, juss didn;t know it was her...but ya, thats the end of that.  fast foward to 9th grade, and i kinda notice her looking at me....the greatest evidence of this is when we where watching a movie...i ended up sliding my desk right up next to her's, and you know, try to wiggle closer and farther away, juss to see what she does...anyway, i get tired, and i put a jacket thing on my head...but i can still see through it, but she apparently didnt know.  I saw here constantly looking down, moving ever-so closer, and biting the lip and/or fingernail...a sign that something is going through her mind....didn't pay it much notice though, i thought i was juss my imagination and wahtever.  Fast foward to NOW, and i contantly see her looking at me.  Now, i know, it could juss be me, but i mean, it's so obvious sometimes! i'm not trying to flatter myself by saying this, it's juss that it's so confusing. well, i barely talk to her, and i think the only good expience we've had is when she came over to talk to me and hernandez.  Well, ya, so thats all about her.  Um, then spanish comes up, and i create more false tention between me and claudia. see, were reading this really good poems this guy wrote...to lazy to link it up, or remmebr his name, but there awsome.  Anyway, everytime he reads one, i think about her....but she always (apparently) thinks about her old b/f Rob, who i know still love each other cause the only reason they broke up (to my knoledge) is cause he went away to collge, and the long distance wasn;t doing them any good.  well, ya, so i was kinda pissed.  I set the conversation up to have it so that i could eventually see her at health smart....it obviously works, and she said she'll be there around 3:30, or apparently before, or ALONG time after, cause i neevr saw her...more on that alittle later..well, ya, nothing happens till earth scince, when alittle peice of info was varified.  See, our littlecircle of freinds has pondered the notion that shawna has no freinds....(well, yuo know, freinds freinds, not juss people you chill with at shcool, and would never talk to the, outside of it), well, it's true, she said it herself,....aside from adam, AND like some other person, there's like no one...yep....juss what i heard...at the end up class, she got all up on my like usualy, giving me false hopes.....ya....nothing else really happnes, then after school comes...OHS mole...O YEAH, THE MOLE....nothing special...i was really tied due to the fact that i woke up abnormaly early. i went down at around 4:32 to go talk to Claudia, but she wasn;t there....i know cause i didn;t see her car, and i didn;t see her inside (she;s usually always doing something where you can see her) so anyway, discouraged, i didn't even bother asking the chick at the counter, who's her friends, if she was, infact, there or not.  On the way bac i felt soooooo burned....see, while i was doing the mole, iwas thinking of EVRYTHING i would do (like i said above),so ya after that, i juss wanted to go to sleep, then kinda did.  after the mole, i had no ride, so mike kindly let me stay over till i got a ride, in which i did, but jones wanted to get a game, so i had to go there too. i end up bieng like 2 hours late, and all we do is watch alittle bit of movies....i go home, fix me clothes, then go on the comp, and start right this shit....my mood pretty much changed through this entite blog...crazy. anyway, like always, i prolly missed alot of shit, and by now, and i'm sure ALOT more sypos..so i'm gonna call it a night....sorry bout the bitching to....but damn, it's good to juss say it ya know?

      sadhasdashdas;dja!!!! ya, today went juss like anyother day...BUT WITH A  urlLink TWIST!   Alot of shit happened now that i think about it....let me explain....last night..because i went to the gym pretty late....i came home late, which, as u guessed, didn't let me do my HW. well, the plan was, skip first period, get APUSH, english, earth science AND math done, and still have 2nd period free to finish up....didn;t turn out that way...i spent BOTH periods trying to come up with that damn essay....and shit man, i didn;t even get shit done.  Jones (thank god) still had an extra copy of HIS essay, and i juss used that as a model to work mine off of (i must say jones, you are an excellent essay writer...you get a  urlLink A+!)  anyway, so i got that done...next was spanish....what can i say? that was pretty cool i guess.  I acutally talked to Claudia, (she always go to the back to talk wit Chen) it was pretty cool...nothing like last year (dun even get me started on THAT) but pretty good. I asked Pos if i could go down to the water machine, and get a bottle, and he was like no, so she offered me some of her Diet Pepsi...i said no (in a nice way ofcourse, always making her smile :) ) but it mad me think.....you  KNOW  your in good with someone if they offer there drink.  She's a  urlLink Super freind,  and so much more.  Last year, we always sat next to each other, always worked together...ya, need i say more? anyway, ya, thats my thoughts about that, like i said,, she's juss a great person....SUPER sexual though (but thats a good thing, right?) anyway, nothing after that happened....i guess it's worth mentioning a dream she breifly mentioned, of how she lost her teeth in it, and how it meant that a freind was gonna die.  I asked her how she knew, and she said it was in her dream book.....i was juss like....wow.  If you don't know the story of me and dreams, allow me to explain.  Acouple of years ago, i was watching montel (i think it was after school, cause it was usually on at that time) and this lady,  urlLink Sylvia Browne  was on, telling people's futures, and how to interpret dreams.....now, don;'t ask me WHY, or HOW, but for some reason, i belived EVERYTHING this lady said...it was an overwhelming feeling of trust, and belief, that it inspired me to want to learn more...atleast about the dream part.  So anyway, after that, i bought some cheap dream book, and then her new book  about dreams. (the one she was talking about on Montel.) So anyway, i get this book, and read it NON-STOP, like, literally, didn;t stop reading it till i got to the end,  It was crazy, but i loved reading, i wanted more SOO bad.  Well, ya, after that i told everyone about my enlightenment, no one really cared thoguh, acouple of the guys told me some of thier dreams, but i didn;t really know what to say, cause ofcourse, i'm no expert...but ya, after that, i end up buying another one of her books (she has ALOT of books) called On the Other side and Back which tells how it's like when you die, and what happens, how it's like, and what she expeirenced during some off her dreams.  Totally changed my life....and i can truly say that, if it wasn;t for that book...i would still be afraid of dieying...and thats NO lie...now i'm calm about it, hell, i'm looking foward to it (and she says theres no devil either...very intresting shit) and NO, i'm not suicidal, so let's not go there...But ya, so thats the mini-story on that, really changed my life, i STRONGLY suggest readin those books..if not becuase you like it...atleast it's intresting to read.  Anyway, ya, back to school...i was acutally pleasently suprised when she said that....VERY...but i can't really do anything about it....as much as i want to...damn..she's great....BUT YA, where both libras...i dunno why i juss typed that, maybe it'll help u iunderstand alittle i guess, we have alot in common, plus i heard 2 libra have the best sex.(O YEAH) and good god, i have heard stories of that girls sexualness...god damn i want.  see, what i like most about her, is juss like me, she juss likes feeling good, she likes pleasure, so she'll get crazy with ya, and everything, and she's def. not afraid of bieng naked and what not...good god, i swear, if i could, i'd marry that girl...i'm gonna miss her when she goes...but anyway, after that, went to earth science where i felt like an ass....not cause i MADE an ass of myself, but becuase i got jealous for no reason at all....see, me and shawna have grown to the relationship level, of , about...i'd say "freinds"  so ya, i'm obviously pretty happy abou that, considering i've liked this girl (along with everyother guy) since like, AMD, but never acutally never talked to her.  But ya, now i do, and she even always wants to work with me on labs and stuff.  And i first, i was like, kick ass, but then i realized, i think she wants to be nearer to Scott.  Scott is a new 10th grader that came from steppanack.  Mad cool, he;s mad good people.  anyway, to me, it looks like she likes him (even though she goes out with adam)  so yeah, i saw them "flirting" and i was like "fuck" but whatever, even if she was in to him, she can;t act on her feelings with out breakn' up with adam, so ya, i dun even care now...maybe i was jealous cause i was tired or something.  Anyway, i go to Music class next period, where, again, i feel like an ass.  I had MAD energy, prolly from being very jealous, so i was jusst playing mad fast, and doing all this random shit, the reason i felt like an ass is cause i think jorge thought i was trying to show off or something, when all i was trying to do was get rid of some steam...i might be wrong, but i saw a face on him that looked like he was thinking 'and he thinks I show off?" so ya, jorge if your reading this, you now know why i was doing that.  But ya, other than that, nothing else happned till 7th period.  By this time, i had my Essay all written up..all i need was to type it.  Rob (fortunatly) still has Jake's Log - on, so i juss used that to type it.  I still had Math though..so i was typing a mile a minute thrying to finish the damn thing.  Whats great was, mike, too, had math HW to do (we have the same teacher) and did it, and while i was typing the thing, he gave me the answers to the math thing, and even though it was wrong, i still got it "done", so mike, thnx again man.  anyway, then comes last period.  nothing special here, other than Jones told me Andy is going to The navy in july.  we were like, "shit, this sucks! it's andy!" but shit, i envy him...i wish i knew what i wanted to do with my life....i have no fucking clue yet...well, ya, then after that, waitied for jones in the TV studio with andy waiting for jones cause he had the car today, and he was gonna give us a ride...MASTURBATION (inside joke).  So we eventually go, and end up driving around ossining a bit...thats right...juss randomly driving.....we drive soem more, then we see a STUDENT DRIVER car! so we go following it, and after a turn, we learn it's elizibeht Lawrence! ya, crazy, she ends up turning, and loos her, thats when we stopped by 7 eleven, i pick up a slurpee (very nasty by the way) and a sandwhich. we drive some more, drop of andy, drop of me, and here i am.  So thats about it. DUn have alot of HW tonight....and i'm gonna go to the gym prolly...oh! and also try to fixe up the page (sorry for Mr. Jackson Up there).  So ya, i'll write later if i want...peace

      ooo yeah, first day back at school! Wasn;t today fucking nuts!?! i feel like jerking off or something to celebrate...but i'll save  THAT  for later....anyway, if your reading thing (all 6 of you) your more than likely looking for some intresting reading...well you know what? i'm here to facking give it to ya...thats right... facking .  Well, ok, i had a crazy fucking night...my lil' brother wouldn't stop fucking around, so i ended up falling asleep at like 12...then, for some reason, i woke up at 5...so ya, i wasn;t to happy about that. but then i went back to sleep, just to be awake again at like 6:15....so yeah, my morning wasn't exactly like those  urlLink folger guys.  (ROFL, go to that link...made funny music....), my mornign was more like what  urlLink this guy  must go through.  Bu ya, i still went to school.  First period went with out a hitch...turned out today was a B day instead of A, so i only had a single.  Next period, went down to caf after quick meeting with 2 gym teachers and a guidance counseler.  Then spanish went by, that went pretty cool, and after that, double of earth science, which was pretty  boring .  the only thing keeping me awake is when i check out shawna. mmmmmmmmmmmm, shawna.....that kinda makes me wanna say  urlLink this.  well, anyway, then some other shit happened.....nothign important really....um...ya, pretty much it, stopped buy video room again, everything was juss wierd.  I dunno.  Anyway, then i stopped by messina's wit andy, where we also discussed at waht time we were gonna go to  urlLink NYSC.  he agreed at maybe five...he called, but i still couldn't go, tied up with work, he said he was heading over at 6, so it wads all good. BUT, i ended up going to sleep until 7:30, so yeah...i missed out on going to da gym, but w/e, i'll juss try to push it overtime tomarrow....it;'s tuesday tomarrow, which means benny is working....whihc means after that, gina get's there, but, i'm totally over that.  I think its' the fact that SHE's OUT OF MY leauge that helped me in the "getting-over" process. So ya, thats the end of that. In other news, i hate HW...THIS JUSS IN...i still dun like it....i had mad shit to do today, but didn;t finish ANY of it..i'mgonna have to pull off a miracle tomarrow....or juss some cuts...well, ya, if i didn't mention anythign it;s cause i just forgot, or am to lazy to do it....well, let's see what tomarrow holds...PEACEZORZ

      ok, for the last fucking time...i dun fucking hate ANYONE k? any more bitching is just childish, and provoking childish fueds.  U know why it  WAS  about mike and Jorge? cause alot of people said shit behind there backs, but never to thier faces.  Now, i do admit, i might have said them alittle harsh (i was caught up in the moment) but what the fuck, the last thing i wanna do is to ruin the freindship.  I'm simply telling them in a non-confrontational way.  Imagin if i pointed out all that shit in front of them, in a group? Imagine how that feels? not to good huh? I find this the best way.  Cause that way, the person now knows what everyone is talking about, and the people talking can now be more honest.  And  once again  i  FUCKING SORRY  ok? i admit it, i know, some things shouldn't be said, but i believe i'm a  better  freind for saying it. Juss think about it, honestly, think about it.  I'm sorry for hurt feelings, for making you angry, for causing ANYONE any pain of ANY kind ok? I'm sorry Mike, I'm sorry Jorge,i'm sorry hernie, i'm sorry david, i'm sorry for everyone else who reads this fucking blog.  I never knew this would be such a fucking problem for everyone.  If you Haven't already caught  WHY  i'm writing about this is because of    urlLink David's Blog  regarding mine. I'm not pissed, i'm not sad, i'm not horney, i'm juss trying to clear up the truth cause theres ALOT of misunderstadings.  like the top says, i DUN HATE ANYONE, if anything, i love everysingle one of you guys, your closer than close...who else could i have male bonding sessions with at jones' house at like 5 o'clock in the morning with? where else could we sleep over and have no problems, where else can i joke around, be myself, and juss have fun? with you guys people, all i'm doing here is getting shit off my chest man.  The Valasquez thing, i felt bad for writing it, i really did, but i juss had to get it off, or else we juss would have kept on luaghing at him and shit, and he would never know why.  We would keep on talking to jorge, and he would always second guess shit, and think the worst.  I'm trying to help the best way i can.  I rather do it this way than face to face...atleast on shit like that.  And thats  definitly  not pussying out.  The issues i talk about aren;t bugging me to insanity, and i feel like killing the person thats doing it, or anything along those lines, theres juss the little thing that everyone knows except for them, thats all.  I'm sorry you rather do shit like that face to face davy-boy, but i also like putting myself in other shoes and acutally try to feel how that person would feel, and trust me, i have been at the end of  Countless  jokes before.  That having been said, i encourage  all of you  to just write what you wanna write about me, cause it looks like i'm public enemy number one for saying what everyone else thinks.  I have no problem with that, i juss want all of you to konw, that when i say something u think is negative about you, it's more than likely ALOT of people think the same way. so, let's recap... Everyone, i'm sorry, dun take this blog the wrong way, don't let digital fucking letters ruin years of freinship.  ok? are we done here? IM me if u got a problem, e-mail, do something, don't just tell me people.  Mike cleared up the arm thing. see, thats good, cause know i know the truth of why he does that, stright from him, and even though it might not be  true, i'm definitly not going to bother him about it anymore,jorge too got acouple of things clraed up with me, and were cool now too.  And as for the tell everyone abot my blog....total BS....i think the only 3 people i told was jones, david, and jorge, the rest juss either over heard, etc, etc.  Don't belive me? let's find out how mike, the only one still mad at me (and i guess with good reason) found out about my blog...

The only other thign u could say is i put the adress along with my "blog" away message, but who looks at my profile with out IMing me anyway? so there you go.  This part of the entry was designed to clear up davids blog, and to clear up everyone else's thoughts on mine. OK, now come on, no more about my fucking blog ok? I frankly dun care who reads it, so juss stop with the bitching and crying already...i admitted my mistakes like a man, and cleared everything up.  As for what happened today...Alot of shit happend. Yesterday, benny wanted to go to the palisades, and asked my andy, and Jorge while we were playing axis and allies.  andy said ya, i said maybe, jorge said most likely no....he said he would call us today at around 11 to see if we were going.  Now, starts today...i wake up at a lovely 10 o'cock and get told by my dad to get ready.  That would be the start of a crazy day.  My dad ends up letting my drive ALOT today...not the beemer, but the kick ass van, so we drive to subway first for brunch, then decide to go to Ciruit-city (i'm still driving...w00t). So on the way, my little bor calls, and dosn;'t wanna go (he won't be with us for the rest of the day and night), so we go without him.  We get there, and are looking at the Cd players for my car.  Now, lemme clear my whole car situation up....it's a fairly old car, 89' year model, so it's pretty old all around..and juss causxe it's mercedes dosn;t mean it's special or anything, which SUCKS, cause there-in lies the problem...i only have one little space thing for a CD player.  Now thats cool and everything, but i have a I-pod....and oviously, i wanna listen to it.  BUT, i can;t with out the tape adapter...and i'm definitly not gonna buy that    urlLink Irock  thing healey has...but looks like i'm gonna have to...let me explain.  Awhile back, we were looking for "the perfect" cd player for the car....many models made the grade, but only one won...the  urlLink KD-SX990  from JVC.  It looked, sounded great, PLUS, it had a MP3 input with COMPLETLY solved my problems, and it was SERIOUSLY cheap to boot.  The perfect one.  Anyway, i was gonna get it awhile back, but never did, and today was suppose to be the day we were gonna get it.  Well, we end up finding a used one for even CHEAPER, and but it.  We had a problem with not getting the maual cause they couldn't find it...but after this guy said we can print it offline, we decided to keep it.  I drive back home, were ready to get started....while my dad is getting his "machanic" clothes on, i'm outside, and decide to take it out, and put it on the trunk of my car...then, disaster struck....the way in which i was holding it, just a whole threw the bag, and fell ass-first on the concrete ground...i was fucking devastated...at first i thought it was all good, i tried to put it back together though...thats when i found out a little, tiny, insignificant peice of plastic had fallen off, and litterally turned the god sent cd player, to worthless trash.  My dad get outside, he;s obviouly upset, and we spend like an our looking for it in my driveway...which is MOSTLY little pebbles the same shape, color, and size of the piece missing...yeah, lost cause.  He get's over, and i kinda em, (we brought it back, got a full refund...suckers...) and them my mom comes home.  After that, sabby calls, tells me that everyone is at the mall, and i say i'll try and meet him up (cause at the time, i thought  was going to the palisades too).  anyway, we end up going to King Buffet, and spending another 2 hours there, where we meet up with my older bro, my sis-in-law, and there 2 freinds.  After that, we decide we wanna go to Woodbury Commons to buy us some stuff from the outlets....now lemme tell you, thats the cheapest fucking place for EVERYTHING, they litterally have EVERY stroe imaginable there, with EVRYTHING cheao ass fuck...i strongly advice everyone to go there.  Anyway, we would be there for the rest of the night...i didn;t see alot of the stores....mostly the clothing ones...and didn;t really find anything to my liking...i ended up walking into  urlLink Armani Exchange  with is basically cheaper uglier, dumb-downed versions of real armani.  as soon as i walk in, i'm scared....turns out, armani exchange is another way of saying "boy-toy spawning area". it was fuking SAD,  everyone had a tight shirt on, it was fucking ridiculous, i swear, i end up trying some shirts on, which i thought were pretty cool...but when i thought about it, it makes me look like a boy-toy wannabe, and it'll make everyone think i'm gay. So i didn't get anything from there.  We go around some more, bla,bla,bla, and end up going into the Tommy HIlfiger store...now THAT is my store...there shit is kick ass....if i had more moeny, i'm sure i would have spent well over 300 bucks on that place, there shit is the best....well, ya, i bought 2 shirts, and went home.....now i'm here, still homeworkless, and wrting this blog.  I talked to sabby alittle earlier, turns out Ben, Andy, Sab, Hernie, his little bro, and his bro's freinds had a blast...sorry i couldn't be there.....well ya, so thats about it...i have another new fav. song to add to my top 10 fav. song of the moment....George Micheal - Faith....and ya, i know the fuck is gay, but that sure as hell dun make me gay, thank u very much....well, ya, so that was the day in a nutshell....now, if you'll excuse me....i have time to waste....

      OK, i'm back for a quick entry, cause i dun think people are going to go to the libra site to find out how i really am.  The way they describe libras is EXACTLY how i am down to the T.  So, i'm juss gonna copy and paste what they have...i''m not taking credit for it, or anything...so no one sue me...  urlLink here's  a link back to them were u can learn even more, so now, here it is....Me: (My REAL entry tonight is below this one)  Libra! About Your Sign... Libra is the only inanimate sign of the zodiac, all the others representing either humans or animals. Many modern astrologers regard it as the most desirable of zodiacal types because it represents the zenith of the year, the high point of the seasons, when the harvest of all the hard work of the spring is reaped. There is a mellowness and sense of relaxation in the air as mankind enjoys the last of the summer sun and the fruits of his toil. Librans too are among the most civilized of the twelve zodiacal characters and are often good looking. They have elegance, charm and good taste, are naturally kind, very gentle, and lovers of beauty, harmony (both in music and social living) and the pleasures that these bring.  They have good critical faculty and are able to stand back and look impartially at matters which call for an impartial judgment to be made on them. But they do not tolerate argument from anyone who challenges their opinions, for once they have reached a conclusion, its truth seems to them self-evident; and among their faults is an impatience of criticism and a greed for approval. But their characters are on the whole balanced, diplomatic and even tempered.  Librans are sensitive to the needs of others and have the gift, sometimes to an almost psychic extent, of understanding the emotional needs of their companions and meeting them with their own innate optimism - they are the kind of people of whom it is said, "They always make you feel better for having been with them." They are very social human beings. They loathe cruelty, viciousness and vulgarity and detest conflict between people, so they do their best to cooperate and compromise with everyone around them, and their ideal for their own circle and for society as a whole is unity.  Their cast of mind is artistic rather than intellectual, though they are usually too moderate and well balanced to be avant garde in any artistic endeavor. They have good perception and observation and their critical ability, with which they are able to view their own efforts as well as those of others, gives their work integrity.  In their personal relationships they show understanding of the other person's point of view, trying to resolve any differences by compromise, and are often willing to allow claims against themselves to be settled to their own disadvantage rather than spoil a relationship. They like the opposite sex to the extent of promiscuity sometimes, and may indulge in romanticism bordering on sentimentality. Their marriages, however, stand a good chance of success because they are frequently the union of "true minds". The Libran's continuing kindness toward his or her partner mollifies any hurt the latter may feel if the two have had a tiff. Nor can the Libran's spouse often complain that he or she is not understood, for the Libran is usually the most empathetic of all the zodiacal types and the most ready to tolerate the beloved's failings.  The negative Libran character may show frivolity, flirtatiousness and shallowness. It can be changeable and indecisive, impatient of routine, colorlessly conventional and timid, easygoing to the point of inertia, seldom angry when circumstances demand a show of annoyance at least; and yet Librans can shock everyone around them with sudden storms of rage. Their love of pleasure may lead them into extravagance; Libran men can degenerate into reckless gamblers, and Libran women extravagant, jealous and careless about money sometimes squander their wealth and talents in their overenthusiasm for causes which they espouse. Both sexes can become great gossipers. A characteristic of the type is an insatiable curiosity that tempts them to enquire into every social scandal in their circle.  In their work the description "lazy Libra" which is sometimes given is actually more alliterative than true. Librans can be surprisingly energetic, though it is true that they dislike coarse, dirty work. Although some are modestly content, others are extremely ambitious. With their dislike of extremes they make good diplomats but perhaps poor party politicians, for they are moderate in their opinions and able to see other points of view. They can succeed as administrators, lawyers (they have a strong sense of justice, which cynics might say could handicap them in a legal career), antique dealers, civil servants and bankers, for they are trustworthy in handling other people's money. Some Librans are gifted in fashion designing or in devising new cosmetics; others may find success as artists, composers, critics, writers, interior decorators, welfare workers or valuers, and they have an ability in the management of all sorts of public entertainment. Some work philanthropically for humanity with great self-disciple and significant results. Libran financiers sometimes make good speculators, for they have the optimism and ability to recover from financial crashes.

      omg..now i'm mother fucking pissed...you see, just about 10 minutes ago...i was writing a blog entry, to publish...but, trilian, in all it's wonder, used the only available window to check my mail...and that window was the one i was writing the blog on....ya...but anyway, i'll get it over it, i'll just write what i had down the first time around.  The day was pretty strieght foward...it started very early, about 5 AM...i woke cause of a dream i was having, which was a pleasant suprise, cause i usually don;t get alot of dreams anymore....kinda wish i had alot more...(i love DREAMS, ther the bomb diggity...but thats for later)...anyway, in this dream, there was a girl.....acutally, it was gina from the gym...and sorry....it's not what you think, we weren't doing the dirty, stuffing the taco, dancing the horizontal tango...it was acutally alot worse...it was what i really want, what i want to live for...what i'm here to do...just..be inlove...it's hard to explain.  I mean, i love/want sex just as much as the next guy...acutally, probably MORE than most guys, but i'm definitly not all about that, i need more, i need the love.  I love just being with people, i want that feeling when you find out both of you like the same things, i like feeling proud to walk next to someone, i like that whole thing...call me the romantix type, but hnestly, thats totally what i am.  I just have to have that feeling, or else i won't liek the relationship...i also love flirting, and saying "i love you"...but, obviously..thats not a very good combinatin.  I'm definitly NOT a player, everyone could tell you that...Mr. Mandel could tell you that..but i mean, if i see someone doing it at me, i'm gonna come back with some.  I dun think alot of freinds have seen this, and that makes sense, cause i dun do it alot, but when i do, it's bliss, i just love it! i juss wish i did it more...ya know? but like i said in an earlier entry, all the girls i'm into are taken, out of my league, or alot older than me.  Most of the times, all three, so as you can tell....i dun flirt that often.  so, ya, i guess thats all about me and my thoughts of flirting.  Anyway, as for saying "i love you" alot...it can only be described as a curse. i mean, i like making people feel good, i love it, i mean, literally, if i make NO one laugh in anyway at anytime during any day, my day would be WRECKED...like, literrallly, i get depressed...i feed of the emotions of others...not many people know that. Deep inside, i'm a seriosuly complicated man...well, anyway, ya, i like saying i love you...thats why i have such high standards when it comes to girls...i want to be able to say i love you, and really mean it....i want them to say it back, and for them to really meet it....ya, prolly won't happen, but atleast i can except it...gotta give that one to me. i mean, SHIT, i say i love you atleast 20+ times a day to my cats and parents...never know when they'll leave ya.  Anyway, back to the day...my love life can be saved for a future entry....ok, so i have this dreams, where i'm falling in love with gina...now WAIT, lemme just recap this to myself....dun know ANYTHING about this girl...barely talk to her, and i'm having a dream about falling with love with her? how does that work you might be asking yourself...well, i'll tell you how...because, phsyically she;s what i like...and because i dun know her, i just filled in all my other "perfect" features in my mind, and had a dream about THAT because obviously, springs coming, and love is on my mind....brains protect the body, keep it healthy, and by doing things like that, it does it's job good. So ya, anyway, the dream is great...i mean, i'm talking awsome, i dun remmeber much, but i know i liked it, which is wierd cause i usually remmeber all my dreams (i still remmebr dreams from like 5th grade...) anyway, so ya, wake up around 5, gotta take a piss...take it, go back to sleep...wake back up around 9, and just sit in my bed, wishing my dream was real...not in the sense of the girl, but wishing i was at that level of a relationship with a girl that i really liked.  well, after that, go online, determined to do APUSH, but dun do it at all.  Andy IM's me asking me if i wanna go to the gym at 3....now, at first i was reluctant....i was still kinda tired, didn;t eat anything, and juss wanted to chill...but i smacked myself out of it, and went.  Now, to my suprise, guess who was working the front counter today? Gina.  Ya, i was pretty damed suprised, unfortunatly, she was talking on the phone, like i see her most of the time, so i couldn't really say anything to her, but i bet i coulda have pulled off some smooth shit...i'm good at that...laughter is the best way into a ladies heart ya know...i relay on that saying...but anyway, i go to the locker room, change, go back to the front where benny and andy are juss arriving, we run, then stretch, then start working out...it was pretty funny, cause i got the frist machine on the side, so i could see her the whole time...and ya, i guess i'm pretty inlove with for, but i fall in love every 3 seconds...i'll get over it....so anyway, we did the whole pumping iron thing, and then i came back home.  We tried to get a game of axis and allies (sorry, no link...to lazy to link it) but it fell through.  After that, i've pretty much been here all day, looking a pictures i want to use for my Hello picture. (sorry, no link again) so ya, thats about it.  I'm just here....doind absolutly nothing....damn, saying that is kinda depressing huh?...absoulutly nothing.....whoa....ya, so BACK TO THE CHICKS!!  so ya....no g/f....sucks.  I need one, have none.  The closest thing right now is this chick in Ecuador named gabriella.  I had a fling with her back durng the summer of 7th grade...(she was my first kiss)...so ya, we got back in touch, and we always talk dirty to each other, saying what well do next time we meet, all that shit...truth is, i think she has seriouly has feelings for me...but i really don...i have no idea why..i mean, she is pretty hot..but maybe its the fact the she's a SLUT that's turning me off....ya...aww man, i'm getting pissed now...i really dun think i'm a bad catch...maybe alittle on the hairy side...but shit, jones has hairy legs, and him and sheel have been together 4ever.  Maybe i should go around playing my guitar....but i hate that, i feel like such an asshole, and when i acutally do do it, i feel like everyone else thinks i'm an asshole...maybe when i get a car i'll have bettter luck, doubt it, but i'll try. ya. o, by the way, it's 12:10 right now, and it feels like it's 8. ya.  i need to make out with someone, thats my problem, i love kissing...all i need is someone to make-out with.  Dun have to be a good kisser, i dubt i'm a good one anyway, i juss need some toungue. i need to please someone. i need to feel good. i'm acutally pretty dexterous with my tounge, and finger (ladies? any taker?) ya i need some of that. you know what i also need? balance. Libra's are aways looking for balance.  thats  why i belive in astrology...it juss makes sense...go  urlLink here.  everything they say about libra is me.  so ya, i'm tired of bitching right now, so i'm juss gonna go lay back with one of my buetiful cats and relax...maybe tonight i'll have another dream...there nice.  I literally have a MILLION things to say, but i have no way of typing it out....i think to much...so long loyal readers, write to ya tomarrow...

      ya, so today was pretty crazy.  The highlight of it obviously was the LAN "party" we had at Jones' house.  This is how the day went though.  basically, nothing happned in the morning, i did the wake up thing, and got online to check the e-mail...turns out mike didn't like what i wrote, which is understandable...but i think he took it way to seriously, it's about what i said about him not going to the gym and stuff at the bottom of the 17th entry.  well, like i told him, and like i tell furture peoplez who decide to get pissed at me....what do u expect? i mean seriosly, when i say shit, it's VERY obviously  something real that the person knows he/she is doing.  Like that thing about mike pickin his arms, that completely came off like him trying to show off arm muscle.  He told me it wasn't, which is cool, and now i know, but it's juss something i thought he KNEW he was doing, thats why i said it.  Now, i do admit, it did come off asshole-ish, and i was an asshole to write it, but this is a blog people, this is my vent...i'm not a violent person at all, and i hate people feeling bad and everything like that.  thats why i sent mike an email back (2 acually, but the first one is before i read what he wrote...i thought it was just what i wrote) explaining this and all that.  He still hasn't IMed me, or called, or even see me yet, so i dunno.  I definitly ain't gonna go chasing after him.  So ONCE again, whatever "bad" thing i say about someone, it's not that i hate them, thats the LAST thing, mike is a great guy, always has been.  It's just that what i say is juss stuff i notice, and just think is kinda annoying, thats all.  Sometimes i dun even mean it....hell, MOST of the time i dun even mean it, it;s just that i let out evrything n here....get it? it's like, losing a baseball game, and after that, getting pissed at someone, and just say all the "bad" things about them.  I dun really mean them, but i do...ya know? so ya, i think a great way to look at it is the way jones put it on his blog, which is linked at the top left of the page....if you dun wanna loose your place,  urlLink here's  a link.  You should go to his blog, he's got alot of things to say...i know i will.  Well, ok, now that we got that over with, back to the day.  After that, i call jones, tell him i'm ready for the ride (he gave us rides, us being me, ben, and jorge + our computers) and ya, he came and what not.  BUT, the single most shocking,  rude, random moment happend.  We were just finishing up loading the computer in, and we see Officer John (Of D.A.R.E fame) drive up the dare mobile, pretty fast,  up cedar lane (my street) while he's passing us, jones makes the joke "hide the smokes" or something along those lines.  then we laugh, hehe, haha, and then all of a sudden, we hear a screech....he backs up, does a reverse U-turn, and comes flying bac down... Now, by this time, me and Jones are already in the front seat...so anyway, he pulls up next to jones, and is like "Is there a problem?" and where like "no, were juss picking up..." and before we can finish the fauck-head goes "i saw what you fucking did.... real fucking stupid" or some shit like that, i dun veen wanna remmeber it. anyway, like expected, me and jones' are completly shock by the whole thing, and quite frankly, i still am.  I guess it makes sense thought coming from a has-been cop/wife beater/drug dealer....he'll get wats coming to him eventually.  Anyway, after that, we head over to Benny's house, and pick him up, that went by pretty smoothly, no problems really, excpet for to cops chatting their mouths away in their cars in the middle of the street.  It's shit like that that makes me wanna be a COP, so i too can go around, bending the law at will....anyway, after telling Ben the Officer John story, we head over to Jorges'.  Poor jorge though, had to bring that giant ass monitor of his, so it took awhile.  but after getting it loaded up, and telling him the Officer John Story, we finally make it to jones' house where  urlLink Andy,  and  urlLink David  were waiting.  After getting the stuff unloaded and ready, we started playing  urlLink Jedi Academy.  (we would play it ALL night) that went pretty good, but we had Andy as the extra an, so once in a while somebody wasn't playing.  but overall, the gaming went smooth, it was fun, and time wasting....just as it should be....Now, i do have to admit, dave did get alittle annoying at times, but that was only at times, and it def. wasn't a big problem.  During the middle of it  urlLink Rob  calls saying he;s heading over at 9, but he never shows....who knows why, but he didn;t miss a whole lot.  I could have done alot of important things today....like HOMEWORK...but i didn't....and i should have...but i didn't..and it's no one's fault but my own.  See, it's not that i have to do the Break assignment, but it's that i have to do ALL that, PLUS 4 other assignments i have yet to hand in....u see, last (2nd) quarter i fail APush...which completly blows....and failed APE for the second time in a row....but thats another blog entry...anyway, so ya, i'm gonna have to do that real soon....prolly tomarrow...if anyone is reading this, and would like to like, i dunno, maybe split the work or something, or maybe juss GIVE me what they have, i'm definitly willing too.  but anyway, that was pretty much the whole day.  The pic below this entry is of this really hot chick named Charisma (awsome name right?) carpenter.  No idea if thats her real name, but she;s soo hot.  She kinda looks like that chick Gina from the Gym.  SPEAKING of the gym,, i forgot to mention, iwas gonna go this afternoon with andy, but i couldn't...which sucks...but damn, i should have, even though i'm tired, i gotta go..i gotta re-build myself to were i was, or else i'll get lazy.  ya..just a personal goal...sorry bout that.  well, anyway, ya, so thats about it, i skipped some shit, but like always, it prolly wasn;t important, or it juss wasn;t important to me...wtyl (sorry about any typos..im kinda REALLY tired right now...)

      booya, this day didn't turn out that bad..., i wrote down another entry today, but this is like a "update".  Now, i must warn you...it's like 12:23 right now, so the typos are just begging to come out, i apologize.  anyway, this is how the day turned out...in my last entry, i proclaimed my admiration of the gym by, well, going to it.  Stayed there for about 2 hours.  Now, today was different though.  when one dosn;t go to gym for a while, then does it again, one must re-work back to the same level...well, you see...i hate that.  I couldn't do anything! i felt like such a weakling, aww man, and when i mean weakling, i'm talkin WEAK! well, ya, i got through it though, nothing big...did a 2 mile run on the treadmill...a shit load of lap-pull-downs, sum bicep curls, seded, hammer something somethings, then some other thing....the usual.  and like aways, everyone is always looking at me.  now, i know what your thinking, i must be full of myself right? WRONG. there all looking at me for my elf ear.  ya. thats rights, my elf ear.  for those of you who don't know, my left ear has this, sorta, bump thing ive had since before birth, which, makes me look like an elf....or a   urlLink vulcan.  (except, it's not THAT bad, it's juss like a little bump thing.) anyway, while were on that subject, lemme juss say, i have NO bad feelings for ever having it. sure, during the early parts of my life, i literally wanted to kill myself for having it, it cause me nothing but pain, humility, and overall suffering.  but, what it also did was TEACH me about all those things. it was a blessing. it made me into what i am today.  because of it, i am no longer that SERIOUSLY shy boy i used to be, i love the spotlight, i love the people, i love the bump, it's incredible...anyway, near the end of the gym session, i was obviously tired...so i stopped alittle early and had dinner (trail mix and gatorade) and waited for my dad to come pick me up.  While i was waiting, i juss roamed the gym, having nothing to do...since my muscles were useless.  BUt, on my epic waiting adventure, i got to check out all the ladies...and OH MAN were there alot of ladies.  Usually in the afternoon is when u catch the REALLY nice looking ones, but today, there were a buncha them, and it was like 5 o'clock.  as always, i think some of them are checking me out..what can i say, when i dun have my glasses on, i see alot of thing that PROBABLY aren't real, but what the hell, it's good to dream alittle.  but my dreams completely EXPLODE when i realize i could never be with ANY of these girls...not cause there outa my league (which they are) but because i'm 16...sure some chicks dig that, but no of them know my real age.  it's crazy man.  but, omg, theres that chick gina, OMG, she works right after benny....jesus, she;s amazing.  what i would give to be with that girl....prolly not alot...but still, she's soo hot. pretty nice too. but anyway, ya, thats all my thoughts about that.....maybe i'll rant about my misfortune with girls some other time...maybe the next time i get depressed or something.  well, after that, i came home...it was about 7:00, and i was gonna head over to robs at 7:30.  but, because my dad was pissed, and my lil' bro randy was hungry, i had to wait until 8:10 before i could get there.  well, anyway, i got there, and yea, it was pretty cool.  Rob showed me his newest DVD, and me, him, and hernie discussed the OHS Mole stuff.  After that, we watch the      urlLink Celebrity Mole: Yucatan  finales.  Rob ended up being right on his predictions of the mole,  urlLink Angie Everhart,  and the winner,  urlLink Dennis Rodman.  Good job to him...anyway, after that, we played acouple games of Kareoke Revolution, and thats about it.  Lemme juss tell ya something...Hernedez is a great guy man, love him, but man o man is he full of himself....there, i said it, thats all i wanted to say, hernie, if your reading this, sorry, but thats the way you come off atleast....someone had to say it (or type it) so here it is.  well, ya.  After that, hernie gave me a ride back here, in which on the way, i discribed my hatred towards weed.  anyway, ya, so thats brings me back home.  THere was alot of details i skipped, but thats only cause i want to go to sleep, i have a big day tomarrow.  I'm suppose to be going to the gym again with sabby, my cat comes back from the vet's, we go to jones' for the LAN partay...and i start my HW, due in like 4 days in counting.  So ya, until next time, wtyl....

      wow....i need some damn typing lessons, cause looking back at my last entry (also, my longest to date) i see that i really am the typo master.  For now on, i'm juss gonna try toacutally CORRECT myself, i appologize to everyone who has read this, puzzled by what kinda language i'm using, i'm sorry....BUT, that still dosn't stop them from happening, it's just that i'm going to try to lessen it up a bit.  Anyway, that having been said, time for today's entry.  Unfortunatly, i have said all i have to say in my last entry, so i really have nothing.  I'll juss tell you how my day is so far.  Woke up at around 8 o'clock to the sound of my mom bringing in my guy-cat to the vets to get nuetered.  Stayed up for a bit more, then took a shower, which got rid of all my cold-like symptoms.   urlLink Sabby  the day before said he wanted to go to the gym today, which i was all for, so i got ready, and called him at 11:20, juss to make sure he was still on, no one answered, so i left a message (on his cell).  I call back at around 12:00, the time we were suppose to be leaving for the gym, and he picked up...turns out he's in tarrytown, and can't make it.  Me, being very optimistic said no problem, i was gonna go anyway, blah,blah,blah, *click*. end of convo.  But, me, also being lazy, just didn;t go, and decided to surf the internet once more for very amusing things, which brings me here, writing this blog.  Rob called, wants to get a meeting for OHS mole, and then we can WATCH the finale, and i think jones wants to start setting up the LAN Party.  thats basically everything that happened so far...absolutly nothing.  but, i have to say, all this time hasn;t gone wasted.  I recently looked at a bucha cheesy, sappy, horrible love poems i wrote about someone last year.  Looking back, i can;t belive i even did, but wtf, i had to let out my feelings somehow right? (ie: this blog) anyway, for archiving purposes, i'm going to type em' all out...but dun critizise me...most of these were wrttin at like 1 o'clokc..which is the equvolent of me being drunk...i  threw away the first 2 pages of songs, i forget why, but i did, so i'll just start from when they start.  They have no names either, it's kinda juss like on, long ass thing, and i think one is about a freinds love situation, but ya, that sums it all up, so here they are:   1  My dad says Ask them out first, get to know them later, i feel like the world is zach, and i'm AC Slater. i try to perform, maybe it'll be a plus but i'm making it worst, i feel like a dunce (wow, that was stupid)  i rush into relationships, but its not my fault there's a empty love in my heart, and it's about to be taught  i can see you looking at me, but i dun't know what you're thinking your sul is glimmering sunlight, mine is only glistening listening, ready for these words I can see you looking at me, everythought saturates my brain. your body is a masterpiece, let me be your frame (o yeah, thats one of my fav. lines)  ok, here they get alittle wierd:  2  it'll help me lift life the wieght from my chest but like everyone else, your taking another great person wraped up why do we do this? we know we like one another, yet we let it go perhaps you were waiting for me, but i just can't it would hurt me to much to find out that this love was just a fad be glad i suppose, you with someone that loves you you equally, head to  toe every second i think about it, it makes me want to yell,  the pain, the torture, the thought is hell i want to be with you, but right now i can't life's a boxing ring, and i'm up against the champ those signs you give me.. have you reached the next level? because you stare at me...infront of your significant other  3  I can see, your exactly like me thats why act like that same attitude....just let it be 2 seats back, one to the left, one seat foward, one to the right. everyday is a struggle to see you, everyday is a fight. it's right or should it be? you know i can see you, looking at me i want to go to you, and love you no more no less maybe your with him because you think there's no one else unfortunatly, thats not true, you have everyone else thats why i don;t stand a chance thats why i must learn to love you 10 feet away with a glance i can see you looking at me, your eyes a oasis under the son you speak poetry, beuty, it all rolls off your tounge  but it is done... next year it'll happen again, i hope i'll be the one i hope i'll be the one...   GOD DAMN, thats some sad shit huh? i dun remmebr writing HALF of that, but now, the whole world can see it.  The funny thing is, these things make it seem like i was alot more into this girl that i really was.  it was more lust than love...but wth, same shit huh?  well, alot of little things happened during this entry...my mom came home, which means i get to go to the gym! w00t! i haven;t been there in like 2 1/2 weeks, or something like that, so i really feel weak, which is making me wanna go real badly.  so i will, i'll give another entry when i get back home, which should be at like 12...but knowing my parents, they'll make me go to sleep as soon as i get home...i might also sleep over robs house tonight, but i doubt it...so yeah, i'll be at NYSC in Croton if ya wanna do something, i'll be there until 6, 6:30, so ya, after that, heading over robs, and after that, setting up for the LAN-A-THON, BOOYA!! wtyl peoplez ( write to ya laterz), PEACE!!! (*note* NOT THAT MANY TYPOS, W00t!!)

      Damn!11 3 days since an update...god damn...i was that busy huh? lol, we, NO, well, ya, but not BUSY busy, more like laziness.  Ok, so last time i updated was about sat, the 14.  So that means the next day was Sunday...jorge's birthday.  Ok, so here's how it went down, on sat or friday, me and the guys played some  urlLink star wars roleplaying game, and during that, benny was like "i'm going to the mall on sunday, who wants to come?" so of course, everyong jumped on the band wagon. (everyone but  urlLink mike  went.  BUT, the dilema was that since it was jorges birthday, AND jorge has antioch freinds, it was either go with us or go with them. ahh yes, bow i remeber, this is a friday.  Anyway, saturday goes by...i end up doing something, prolly went to  urlLink jones'  house (AKA Home Base 2k4) again.  so ya, sunday roles by, and  urlLink benny  comes to pick me up around 1:20, seeing as i'm the nearest one. (I live on Cedar lane, he lives on havell street, it's like literally a five minute walk)  So ya, then we go pick up jones, he takes acouple of minutes to get all his stiff together, me and benny wonder why, blah,blah,blah, it's not important...and way he gets back in the car, and we call jorge, cause apparently he's at  urlLink rob's  house sucking his dick....not really, but ya, he was there.  so we roll over there, and there he is, he getes in, we exchange hello's, and ask rob if he wants to come..ofcourse, he says no, and we go.  So, me, being the smart one that i am  urlLink (example)  ask's if he's still gonna go with his anticock freinds.  Apperently, this sparked the COOL-o-meter in jorge's brain, and told us the COOL time he had w/ his freinds...lol, no, i'm exagerating, some SERIOUS SHIT happened.  He was telling us how he went the say before with them, cause thats when they decided to go, so they went to applebee's, ate some apples, and bees, and chilled at Joanna Rose's house.  (She goes to antioch too, w/ her bro mike...dun ask me how i know that...) and then that     urlLink hernandez  (a long time sufferer) had an asthma attack.  But hold on ladies and gentlemen, it gets better....apperantly jorge, being the swell guy he is, had to drive em' there on a PERMIT. (atleast thats the was i understood it, i could be wrong)  But wtf, at least he got em there, then he added that he satyed with him til about 2-3 clock' at the hospital until he went home and caught some heat for not even calling his parents.  Now, there are something i must infrom u of....Hernandez has a sister, a 19 year old sister (i think) i hot sister (so many claim), that has a perfectly VALID license to drive her poor bro to the hospital.  The way i heard it, she was being a bitch, and didn;t wanna drive, so thats why jorge had to drive em there.  I'm not saying i hate her or whatnot, i'm juss addin in some info.  anyway, and also, that jorge says he called, but it din;t get through, which is code for he forgot to, or i dunno....w/e, that last one didn't even matter.  but yeah, so we were like, holy shit, is he alright and what not, and according to jorge he was fine.  I would have called him to see whats up, but i dun have his number, and i can;t call jorge cause his dad is doing taxes, and i can't talk to hernandez's sister, cause them i'm gonna try to hit on her, and embarass myself...so yeah, if you reading this hernie, hope ya doing good, hope ta see ya soon.  OK, well, ya, so the epic quest continued onward, to the tapanzee, were there was alittle bit of a traffic situation...kinda looked like  urlLink this,  except that was the George washington bridge.  anyway, me being the co-pilot (my  urlLink i-pod  give me special advantages) tried to play my best tunes...when that failed, we kept on play "What is love?" by  urlLink Haddaway  I would give u a sample of his song, but all the site i treid to get it off of suck ass.  SO your juss gonna have to go DL it off of Kazaa or something.  Anyway, we ended up having a AMAZING QUEST at the mall.  Originaly, we had planned that we were gonna go to X-zone, a LAN where people play game, make international phone calls off computers..and more importnatly, waste money.  Well, before we did that, we wanted to head to    urlLink Dave and Buster's , but, if you read there  urlLink policies',   you can't get in by yourself if your under 21, with out a person OVER 21 there with you.  So ofcourse, i had a genius plan, in the food court, right next to that asian arcade thing, there was an alternate way to enter, another escalator that led directly into the ass of the place.  Well, everything seemed prefect, we headed up like it was no one's business, no problem, i ofcourse was going alittle quick cause i was excited, so i was ahead of the pack.  I assumed everyone was behind me, so i juss kept going.  On the way, i see this really fat kid, and a somewhat skinny kid juss sitting there, look at us, as if they juss tried the same thing, and that we were going ot fall into the same trap.  But i had a secret weapon...i ofcourse, do not resemble anything 10 YEARS close to my acutal age, so i knew i was gonna get in with out a hitch,  hell, i did it last time i was there to, the guards never thought twice, so i KNEW i wasn;t gonna get caught.  jones was sporting a growign beard, so he def. looked older, and ben, like jones, also was sproting the semi-there beard.  The only one that we were worried about was jorge, but since he was with three "older" guys, they would assume he's under some sort of "adult" supervision, and be let in.  well, anwyay, we continued until we weere all the way in, by that time, jones and jorge were all near me, and literally, we were about 3 feet away from getting in the arcade...once we go through those doors, we were dun.  but, all good things must end sometime, and unfortuantly they ended before they even began.  turns out, benny, who was behind by that time, was caught by a bitch as hispanic she-guard.  I think it was jorge who turned around and spotted him, cause if didn;t i was about to keep on going.  But anyway, we were all like "shit..." and i'm SURE everyone knew we were dun.  so i go over there, and saying shit like "whats the problem" and shit like that, praying that she'll think i;'m over 21, and say "o, i'm sorry, i didn;t know he was with you, go on". BUT, she caught the lie faster than jorge contracts illness's, so we were dun.  We were beaten, but we vowed (atleast i did) to come back , and try a second time.  Well, because D&B was on the 4th floor, we didn't have to walk along distance to get to x-zone.  we ended up staying there for an hour, played   urlLink Counter-Strike  the whole time.  after that we went back to EB games (we went there shortly before going to x-zone) to look around again.  once again, we didn't do anythign, cause we all didn't know what else we were gonna do.  Well, anyway, the main reason we went to the mall is so Ben can get a hoody sweatshirt, so we headed down to modells.  Well, he found his hoody's alright, but there was a SHIT LONG line to wait on, so we said fuck it.  I on the other nad, the whole time, was staring at all the  urlLink Under Armor  contemplating weather i should get the long sleeve one i wanted, or to wait.  Well, anway, since we were gonna try i diff store, i was juss like "if i dun find i better deal, i'll juss get it here" so we end up going to sports athority, right downstairs, and doing the same thing.  They wrre the same price, but i still didn;t buy em'.  Anway, yadda,yadda,yadda, we saw jorges parents, said hi, yadda yadda yadda, went to best buy, yadda yadda yadda, bought Jedi Knight: jedi Academy, yadda yadda yadda, went home, yadda yadda yadda, went to mikes... NOW....all that did juss happen, but not in that order..it's juss that i didn;t wanna type that whole thing, i've already spent almost 2 hours wrting this time.  anyway, the way we got to mike's house was this.....we had to get home early, so it WAS early..and we wanted to get a game of that star wars thing going on.  BUT....u must remmeber, it was sacred sunday, and jorgie had antioch, and wanted to go, cause they have fun there. anyway, so when we sropped him off, we didn;t know we were going to mikes, so he ended up going.  me, jones and ben end up going to mikes and watching  urlLink Pulp Fiction  (a AWSOME movie) and star wars, a new hope.  But by that, everyone had fallen asleep, so i had to turn of the Tv, etc....Now, lmee juss tell you...i am NEVER going to sleeep over mikes again, the mother-fucker snores like you would NEVER belive....it's fuking incredible...i ahve no idea how he;s little brother can handle it.  it;s fucking nuts. o, and lemme juss say...Sammy Jackson is a  urlLink Baddass.  ANWAY, so u can imagin, i had a pretty bad, and to top it off, i was real sick (and still am) so i didn;t really get a great sleep. (and sorry to whoever i get/got sick).  So ya, then we woke up, spent a-many hours playing   urlLink Soul Caliber 2.  Mike thinks he's good, but he has NO idea what he;s doing...well, anyway, then we got home, and decided we wanted to get a game that day to make up for the one we didn;t have last night, so me, mike, and ben ended up going to jones' house.  While we were over there, we learned that jorge was at hernie's house.  According to jones', he didn't wanna go.  See, thats why we consider jorge to be all our little brother.  Not in the sense that we love him, but in the sense that he;s annoying, and childish, and that everything he does is because someone else did it...he;s a follower, and always will be. No offense to him (and sorry jorge if your reading this) buts it's juss the truth. i mean, because of him, the 3 days at vermont we spent filming went to the shit cause of him, but anyway, ya, so he wasn;t gonna go to jones' any time soon.  So we wait, play more soul caliber, blah blah blah, and then jorge calls back saying he;s going to Sam Ash in White Plains with hernie.  So were all like "fuck" and we juss tell em' get here when u can, or something, and we decided to start with out him....the reason we wanted him to be there was because his new character was being introduced.  anway, it's about 5 minuted AFTER we introduce him, and he show's up wearing that hoody that looks HORRIBLE on em'.  anyway, we play until like 7:00, until mike has to go.  lol, i must add though, mike brought his   urlLink Metal Master  to show jorge and shit, and blah blah blah, when jorge think NO one heard, he's like "why dun i go over, ya know, sleep over, i canteach you new things, blah blah blah." See, thats wht i noticed, the only reason why he goes over hernie's and Mikes so much is to play guitar, and apprently teach them.  Kinda sad if u ask me, but w/e, i'm no one to judge.  but ya, they go, then ben, i stay until maybe 8 20, then go.  I get home, install Jedi academy, and play till like 12:34.  I wake up, and that brings me to today.  I've been home ALL day, mostly playing Academy, and watching tv.  Nothing else.  sabby called while i was sleeping to go to the gym, but i juss couldn't, i'm definiltly going to the gym tomarrow....i love it there, i can juss get rid of all my stress there,  urlLink andy  got me going there, and ever since, i've loved it.  we've pushed jorge and mike to go there, being as there like the only 2 in  our group acutally willing to go, but all we get is excuses from them.  Mike, apperntly thinks sitting on his ass all day, eating like 4 meals a day, and going to weight lifting class everother day for HALF-AN HOUR is gonna make him strong, but what ever.  Evertime he thinks i'm trying to show off, or he feels like showing off his "muscle's" he pretends to stracth his arms, and preetends that he;s doing something to give him an excuse to roll up his sleeves, and show of his fat.  ya, pretty embarrasing.  Jorge ont he other hand, is pretty damn skinny, always has been, always will be.  We want to get him in the gym, cause we all thought it'll get him in shape, and acutally give him some confidence we never see.  Plus, his muslce will show more cause hes so skinny.  anyway, he's apperntly ALWAYS sick, and all the times he went with me, it was a waste of a guest pass.  But atleast he went.  anyway, jones is gonna start going to which is awsome, and ben WORKS there, so he gets to go for free anyway.  But ya, back to life....i've been here...all day, did nothing...and just spent about 2 hours wirting this entry.  if you've sticked to reading this all the way down to here, i thank you, it shows that u really wanna read waht i got to say, and i really apreciate that.  Well, my fingers hurt right about now...so i think i'm just gonna go look at all my old love poems i wrote last year...I'll prolly talk about em' in the next entry...until then, Thanx, take care, and practice what you preach....

      w00t...long ass day, let's take this slow.  I woke up about 6 am cause my cats wanted me to give em' food, but i juss didn;t comply, i mean, maybe if they looked like  urlLink this  i would help em' out, but instead, they look more like  urlLink this.  so, yea... anyway, i woke up real sick (which i still am) so i wasn't really HAPPY to get up.  I stayed in bed until 930, until my parents woke up and told me to get dressed.  U see, today was my lil' bro's baptism.  Now, usually at these events, there are alot of people there, (my dad was baptized,confirmed, had his first communion, and got married all on the same day) but at my lil bros...only 8,  me, my dad, my lil bro, his 2 god-prents, and their 3 kids. well, ya, wasn;t exactly a sell out crowd.  Well, we got there around 11:40, like we were suppose to, cause the ceremony was at 10. Well, the preist was late, and we started around 12:25-30.  But ya, we got on with it, and it all went acording to plan, BUT  urlLink A MIRACLE  (in my eyes) happened.  Because we started late, and all that junk, other people that usually go to that church started to show up, it was awsome, i think this white family came in first, with this dude that looked EXACTLY like  urlLink Bono  from  urlLink U2.  SO yeah, and then some spanish people started coming in for another baptism though, adn stuff, and by the end, the house of god was SOLD OUT BABY! wooo!! well, ya, it was crazy.  After that we went to go eat at "Flames" in Briacwiff.  Nice resturant, pretty upscale though, by the end of the day, we ended up paying a $400 bill...for food.  THe most i have EVER spent at a resturant, and probably the last time i ever will. i mean, shit, the bill cost more than my fucking car! i could have bought, a horse or something....or maybe even  urlLink this thing. but, what can i say...it was pretty damn good food.  After that, my parents decided they wanted to go see a movie, BUT i still had my suit on, so i felt like a dick, but we still went.  And after a 20 minuted discussion on what we were gonna see, we ended up seeing 50 First dates. (but since we bought the tickets pretty late, we didn't see the previews...DAMMIT) Here's The review:    50 First Dates     Ya, i definitly DIDN;t wanna see this movie...it looked dumb..BUT it's not bad, but it;s just not the kind of movie you wanna see with your parents, it;s more for like coples and shit.  THe movie revolves around Adam sandler....i forget what his name in the movie is....we'll juss call him adam.  Anyway, from the beggining of the movie, you know he's a MAJOR player, and he knows how to treat a girl...but thats it, u don't really get anymore info than that.  Well, ya, they go through some scenes and shit, but thats basically it.  Anyway, u find out he works at this aquarium as a vet.  Rob shnider is his hawaiin freind with like 6 kids who follow him every where.  So ya, it all good and stuff, and that guives the movie the excuse to use the cute animals.  Anyway, u also find out adam;s dream is to go to alaska in his boat, the  "sea Serpent" which is what he calls a toy car stuck in his ass. (not really) Well, ya, he ends up trying it, sucks, and has t call in the coast guard.  While he's wating, he goes into this resturant, and in comes to FAT ASS hawaiins.  There not important, thats where he meets drew barrymore's chracter lucy.  Everything goes on awsome, they hit it off GREAT, and blah blah blah, cues all the couple in the audince to hold hands and shit..ANYWAY, she invites him tomarrow to the same place.  He goes, blahb blah blah, then the FAT ASS hawain chik tells him that she has SHORT TERM MEMORY.  So there we go, i thinks thats all i have to say, the movie then continues on, him trying to get her to fall in love with him dozens of more times, until, at the end, they find out how he can make the relationship work.  I skipping over alot of stuff, but thats only cause if u wanna see it, i dun wanna ruin it for ya, its a pretty sweet movie, but like i said, u dun wanna go see it with your best buds...or your mom, dad, and lil bro.  So outa 5, i give this movie a 3...the animals, drew barrymore, and juss the whole "winning the girl" thing at the end was awsome...if i didn;t have Plastic surgery, i prolly would have shed a tear....or let go of a fart...either one so ya, there ya go, pretty nuts stuff.  After that i came back to ossining, went to carvel  urlLink breifly  then went home....i got home REAL tired, but when i got here,  ti was JUSS 6, so i went online juss to see if anything was going to go down tonight, aprrently nothing was, but the bright lasers that come out of my screen filled up my eye balls juss enugh to keep me awake to blog it up. spent some time after that juss checkin sites and shit (not porn) and sent dave some more pics for the gallery...i got some more i've neever seen of myself...and HOLY SHIT...let;s juss say THINGS HAVE CHANGED. WEll, ya, check out the  urlLink gallery  if you wanna see em' i guess.  OOOOO, did i forget to mention today is VALENTINES DAY?!?!? well, ya, it is, and ya, i had no date, but wtf, i was with the people i love the whole time.....now obviously i can;t make out with them, but they did buy me something! w00t!  i win! so yeah, tomarrow is jorge's B-day, so ONCE again, happy b-day to him.  He said he can either go with us, or his antioch freinds.  Antiock is basically a fun-church.  THey do alot of gay things, but the fun stuff they do definitly out wieghs that.  I was the first one Rob approched to join, and i was enthusiastic, but then, i chickend out, and ended up not going.  So jorge in hernie got in after that, and well, the rest is history.  But ya, if i think it;s gonna turn out how i think it is....He's prolly gonna go to dave and busters with his antioch freinds,and the rest of us will go to X-zone.  Well, juss gonna have to go see how it turns out i guess, until next time, keep yourself busy with something.

      another day, another blog entry...today acutally didn;t go as bad as i thought, though it was still kinda hectic.  Last night i ended up falling to sleep at about 12:20 due to my heater.  It made sounds similiar to that my parents would make if they were makng love...so, obviously, it kept me up in disgust.  I woke up, real tired, and went to school anyway, did the the whole go to class thing, and then went to messinas with rob for a enlighting visit to the little italian deli, all along carrying my guitar i brought in for music class, which i brought cause i didn;t wanna leave it in there for a bout 2 weeks.  Anyway, right after that, i went to go do my schedual w/ my guidance counsular.  I'm gonna take SUNY Engilsh, SUPA Forensics, Math 4, S.E.L.F, Film and Lit, and Italian 1.  Thats pretty much it, give or take some stuff.  ya, well, that wasn't the highlight of my day...the highlight had to be seeing my report card....turns out i DIDN'T fail math, he bumped me up to a D- which i'm grateful for...BUT, i did fail english for the second time(Which i already knew), AND APUSH, which REALLY sux cause i thought i definitly did better than a F.  But w/e, ya ain't gonna solve anything by cryin', i'll juss do better or something, i think i aready am anyway.  Well, ya, after that, the day went pretty smoothly, Rob along with the rest of us started the first rounds on OHS Mole, which, took alittle longer than expected, but got done.  Marzella (along with myself at times) was being a dick wit the guitar, but i restrained my self.  I'm not like Hernandez and jorge always trying to show off whatever they got at me.  Like rob said, theie prolly insecure with something, and have to make it up by trying to out due someone in something, unfortunatly, it has to be guitar... It is VERY annoying having to go through it, everytime, it;s juss fucking sickening.  And the crazy part is, i like those guys, i've always said that, they're great dudes, but its juss that damn guitar playing.  Maybe i should try getting into a different hobbie, maybe start collecting condoms, or...dirty diapers...lol, no, maybe not that, but i dunno, i'll see...i've been getting ALOT more into cars considering i'm gonna start driving alittle sooner than planned, (my dad RULES!) so maybe i'll get into that.  Anyway, that was pretty much the school day in a nut shell, nothing more about that.  I dunt really remmeber much acutally, cause i was so damn out of it, but i remmeber enough to know that i wore a REALLY fucked up shirt today, i nick named it the "Toxic Avenger" shirt cause one side + the back of it are green, like ooze.  ya, i prolly won;t wear it again, but since it was a gift from my mom, i mostly likely AM gonna put it on again.  OO!!!! OMG OMGOMGOMG, i juss remembeerd a REALLY crazy movie we saw in spanigh today (cause my teacher and ALOT of students are going to spain like...tommarrow?) it's this crazy french film, a surreal film, a black and white silent film, REAL old, Directed by Luis Bunvel, and was co-directed by Salvador Dali, a fmous artist dude.  Ya, it's called urlLink Un Chien Andalou  and is DEFINITLY one of my all time fav. films.  Like, if i ever become a film maker of some sorts (which has crossed my mind) i would make films like this.  It;s fucking NUTS MAN!! Like seeing a duck taking a shit UP CLOSE! it juss blows your MIND!! (Sorry, i juss finished 7 liters of coca-cola.....well, not really).  Well, ya, that was juss a little didly on that....DON't forget to visit the    urlLink photo gallery  to catch pics of all of us.  I'm the one with the beard...thats all you gotta know...Well, ya, we played that Star Wars role playing game today...we ended up DLing the books and ad to change somestuff on our character sheet.  The role playing gang consists of  urlLink jones,     urlLink mike,   urlLink ben,   urlLink jorge,    urlLink myself,  and  urlLink Ivan.  Ivan is CRAZY!  But ya, so we played and what not, and now i'm here, writing in this thing.  Alot of random shit happened today, like i broke my leg, saved a baby, and ate a enitre pig, but that stuff wasn't intresting at all.  I rather juss attempt to work on the Circuit-Bored? site, the site for my show, but thats getting no where....i'm prolly juss gonna end up making a simple HTML one, nothing special, just something.  O! sunday is the J-mans (Jorge) birthday, still dun't know what were gonna do, but it should be awsome, so happy B-day to him.  And the next week we should all be over at    urlLink jones'  for a mega LAN party, which should kick ass.  We plan on having ALOT of fun (not that way), and get like 2 or 3 episodes of circuit-bored? done if everything goes how i plan. o, and i have to go to my lil' bro's baptism tomarrow..dun wanna, but i have to...cause jesus told me he'll give me a dollar....(sucker)  But ya, overall, it's been a crazy day. PEACEZORZ TO THE  urlLink MAXZORZ!! ..... urlLink HOLY SHIT!! IT CAN SMELL MY FEAR!!!!  P.S: Sorry for all the typos...but i warned ya!!  urlLink MUAHAHAHAH!!

      stupid stupid stupid...i juss had another entry in, but i decided to change it...i'm feeling REAL bummed out right now, i juss have to get it down on digital paper.  Once again i am feeling down because of one thing....women.  I don't understand, i thought libras were SUPPOSE to be all good at stuff, like, romantic wise...and i know i can be romantic, but i have no one to show man....i fucking hate this shit, sometimes, i juss wish i can get up on a stage, with all crowd of all the girls i'm intrested in, and juss tell em', one by one, "i'm really intrested in you, would you like to go to the movies or something?" i dunno, anything along those lines, jUSS PLEASE, i don;t want to be single anymore, i mean it's great, dont get me wrong, it's just that i can't take it anymore, everywhere i look, theres someone making out, theres someone holding hands...i mean the least most likely person is getting fucking PUSSY! (don't get me wrong, i dun wanna get into a relationship juss for the beaver...but i do belive it's important in a relationship...)It's so depressing knowing that like, all your buds (minus a few, sorry man) are succsesful.  And to top it of, all the girls i DO like, are A) To old, B)taken, C)Out of my league and D)all of the above. i hate it, i don;t know why, it's like a curse.  And don't even TRY to say it's worse for some people, you have NO idea.  Jorge is my main example.  People put him down man, and even though i do it too, i still feel sorry for him, BUT he acutally gets around, meets people, mingles.  Sure i'll do that, but i DON'T want to.  My whole philosophy is: If she likes you, she'll come to you, then, if i like her, i'll go on from there. Like, she starts, i finish. I know your probably saying "thats the reason why your having such bad luck",but i mean, i like it that way.  That way, you don't have to worry about rejection, and i KNOW everyone hates to be rejected, it's horrible, i haven't tried to get with enough girls to have that happen to me, but i'm sure i never want to.  And ya, i'm sure there are girls who like me, and want to be with me, but i need a sign.  I bet the whole entire population of girls at that school could be inlove with me, and i'd be the very last to know.  I need a damn sign! i need another   urlLink Libra! (they have great sex together, and Yes, i'm a libra, born sept. 28, 1987) i need a  urlLink Leo! , SOMEthing compatible! (ya, i belive in zodiac stuff) I need anything! I wanna write down poem after poem on how i feel, but it's not getting anywhere....But ya, i have gotten close to many people, and i guess thats also maybe part of the problem, theres this girl, (also a libra) that i've known since last year, awsome person...BUT, at the time she was going out with someone for a LONG time...so i kept my distance...i'm pretty sure i got some feedback from her, but i defeinitly didn;t wanna ruin what they had....fast foward to now, she's single (to my knowledge) and i'm not doing a single damn thing about it....i dun know, maybe i should walk around and tell everyone that i drive a mercedes benz, and have a 7 inch cock, maybe that'll do it..... i mean EVERYWHERE i see, people are together, doing everything, EVERYONE is doing great. shit, i'm sorry, but this shit is unbelivable.  If your a chick, and live in this area, call me, or IM me, or e-mail, do something, i'm ready for everything, i'm good to go, juss show me, and i'll take it from there...well, enough problems...tomarrow i'm staynig after school, Helping rob out with "OHS Mole", so i'll prolly stay after for a bit, after that is a week of vacation.  were heading over to dans house for a week long LAN party, in which rob is going to bring his copy of  urlLink Karaoke Revolution , which by the way is a great game, played it for the first time at robs, definity fun, but ya, thats pretty much it.  If i dun do anything, i'm going to head down to NYSC, get rid of some stress, the stress i'm definilty going to have after KNOWING i have no valentine..:o(, and if i do have one, i already have an idea of who it is..and i won;t be suprised, but it it is who i think it is, i'll prolly take advantage of that, and try to hook up with her, but ONLY if i get one...ya, well, thats about it, i'll prolly type something tomarrow, or maybe another one today...we'll see

      Ok, for those of you that didn't notice, i wasn't in school today....i was to busy saying goodbye to my dad who went to Ecuador today.  I woke up at like 5, then got back home  at around 10, then went to sleep until around 12.  Then i get a call from jones, saying where doing shit today, but i have no idea whats going to happen.  Um, what else, what else....O YEA! juss before he left, my dad ended up telling me he had a .357 Magnum this whole time....i was like, DAMNIT! and he was like "yea"....so, yea.  Um, nothing else to say.  I might not come home tonight, and may have  LAN party tomarrow, and, ya, thats about it, i have no idea whats going on with the antioch crew, but we'll see what happens.

      Libra is the seventh Sign of the Zodiac, and it is at this point in the Zodiac that we start to see a shift. While the first six Signs of the Zodiac focus on the individual, the last six focus on the individual's contact with others and with the world. Librans are first and foremost focused on others and how they relate to them. We can call this the Sign of partnership with a capital 'P' because these folks do not want to be alone! For a Libran, everything is better if it's done as a pair. Librans are good when paired up, too, since they epitomize balance, harmony and a sense of fair play. While they are true team players at work, their favorite partnership is at home: marriage. Librans feel most complete when they are coupled up with their lover, forever. It's the Scales which symbolize Libra, and just like that balancing mechanism wants to stay even, Librans want to be on an even keel. Think of the Scales of Justice and how they work at striking the right balance. Likewise, Librans are objective, just and want to do what's best for everyone. It's possible, though, that this penchant for fairness is for a different reason: Librans abhor conflict.  The Scales study every possible angle in the hopes of achieving peace and harmony, so much so that others may see them as fickle and indecisive. If that's what it takes to avoid a confrontation, that's fine with the Scales. The Libra-born are keen strategists, organizing groups with poise and getting the job done (in keeping with the Cardinal Quality assigned to this Sign). Further, you can expect the Scales to be companionable, sociable folks. Libra is ruled by the Planet Venus. In ancient Roman mythology, Venus was a smooth seductress who was at her best amid pleasurable excess. Well, Librans are certainly carrying the torch for her today. The Scales are cultured, refined and love beautiful things. Most of all, they love beautiful people, which is why Librans do so well at cocktail parties or at the theater, opera or ballet. Those born under this Sign always have the right thing to say and know how to make others feel comfortable. Suave? You bet. Librans are so adept at charming conversation that they need to be mindful of overstepping their boundaries and appearing vain or gossipy (the Scales do love intrigue). When these folks are on their game, however, they are a pleasure to be with. Librans are artistic, stylish and enjoy creating a beautiful world. The converse of this is that bored Librans can become apathetic and lazy -- but they'll smile anyway. The Element associated with Libra is Air, and that means reaching higher, specifically to the higher mind.  Librans like to put their mind to good use, and enjoy communicating their thoughts to others. They like to use their smarts (and talk) to get to know others better -- yes, knowledge about people is where it's at for Librans. You can expect the Scales to make a fair argument, too, since they live by the principles of diplomacy and compromise. When this approach doesn't work, however, Librans are not above using their persuasive charms to get their way. Manipulative? Nah, Librans really are too nice for that. Plus, any end-runs that these folks use are usually to build themselves up, since the Scales can be easily deterred. Librans are polite and don't like to fight, far preferring to talk things through. Remember, these folks know how to communicate (they're Air) so they're bound to make their point. Librans don't get in a huff when faced with an opposing viewpoint. Rather, they take a deep breath and consider all the options in the spirit of cooperation. Librans at play may not be as energized as at work, if you call socializing work (and the Scales do). That's why exercise for Librans needs to have a social component to it, such as that found at a gym. Alternatively, Librans love the outdoors, so riding and biking can also prove fun. They also love the colors of the sunset sky, that melding of ivory, pink and light blue. In the game of love, Librans are a bundle of energy, romantic and loyal to the core. The Scales need to be on the lookout for their lower backs, though, which tend to shoulder any burdens they may be carrying. The great strength of the Libra-born is their quest for fairness, peace and harmony. That the Scales are the great diplomats of the Zodiac further helps their case. A beautiful journey this will be, thanks to the Libran's inimitable sense of style.

      DOOWOP, DOOWOP, DOOWOP.  I like how when i made a promise to myself to raise my grades, i'm in fact fucking them up.  Ya....so tomarow i have to shift my ass into high gear and overhaul.  This sucks, yes, but it's for the better....i want to get most of it done by this weekend.    I'm watching Old school right now, and shit....i should try and get into a frat or something.....but then i think about how most of the guys are all boy-toys, so i change my mind   BOLD   Well, mad peoples took there road test today, and passed....it's making me that much more ansy to take it myself.  I fell i got a hell of a chance, but i can;t let that get to my head.  I have a nice car waiting for me.......And shit, i spoke to my dad today, as to what car i can drive while he;'s away in ecuador for a week....apprently NONE cuase he dosn;t want me driving while he's not there.  Watching oldschool right now has also made me want to have more fun with freinds.  It's very sad that all new freinds made at antioch are most likely going to leave.  Really sucks.  Thats why i think we should all chill, you know, get more memories.  Plus, i think i should get drunk.....  so, i'm looking at my blog, and realize i have ALOT of shit to say....some not important or relavant at all, but i still have to say it, it's fucking nuts.  I think i have more entries than all of my immideate freinds entried  combined.  I also appparently have 1431 visits already.  It's crazy.      YOUR MY BOY BLUE!!!!!!!     bye bye

      .............................................................ya, this weekend has been VERY crazy so far...i have done more this weekend that i've prolly done last month (thats a lie). um, but to make this quicker, i'll ONLY describe what happened yesterday, as opposed to friday, where everyone is convinced me and steph got down and dirty...  Well, ok, we saw dawn of the dead.  Ya, like a remake/expansion movie thing that has to do with zombies.  Now, i have to admit, it was a good movie and all, but i dun think it was worth fucking 10 dollars.  Anyway, um, the usual group plus 2 showed up.  It was basically, all antioch people, and Mike H., and Dave.  All together, there was about..................10 of us, me, andy, dave, mike, rob, scott, jorge, hernie, Steph, and sabby.  Ya, pretty big group.  Um, we made the usual jokes and shit, but becuase of them black folk', and there loudness, they reuined alot of the movie, especially for robs dad i heard.  So ya, i guess it couldn've been better if some people stoppped being so scared, and had to make it up by being loud. um....well, ya, there not much i can say about being annoyed by my freinds like david said he went through.  I guess we dun care cause were so used to it, so, ya, sucks for him i guess. Me and jorge were fairly quite, um, sabby had to yell acouple of times for some reason, and the farthers i got down the row was like, about 4 seats down from me, which was andy...after that, i couldn't hear/see anyone else.  i think i was the only one to acutally go to the bathroom during the movie now that i think about it, which is kinda cool, and i farted like 3 times.....it was awsome, i spread my cheeks to not make noise, and i hit them with a super secret stealth fart that didn;t even stink....ya, i'm that good.  ok, maybe i didn;t do that, but i have nothing more to type.....i went to sleep late, wooke up like 4 times today, and i kinda fucked up parellel parkin at lessons today.  To add to that, my parents are like, o we juss gonna get some bags, and we;ll bring home food and shit...turns out they went to manhatten again, and aren't coming home for awhile....my breakfast so far was one of the frozen snickers bar and some V8 Splash.  Ya, so i have a big headache.....well, what else is supose to happen...i still have most of my APUSh to do...it's not hard, juss alot of work, and i'm going over to benny's.....i'm juss gonna bring over my shit to antioch tonight....see, cause it were going at 6:30 to write thankyou letters and what not.  Um, ya, nothing more to say.....i've been looking for some shit to read, and the only people that still update there blogs that i can see are dave and Jones.  I've read davids recent entry, but i won;t comment...and jones'  away message reads that he's updating, but he;s most likely playing a game.  NOTHING INTRESTING TO READ! NOOO!!! well, ya, i'm juss gonna head over to bens house and order some chinese food.....i might add another entry.... ADD  being the main word there......... ?

      hello people, to another entry.....damn, i juss have to say one thing before i continue....why have more than 1286 people been here?!?!! lol, no, acutally, i think thats awsome, it shows that people acutally wanna see what i write, for whatever reason, so to all of u that come here (which i'm pretty sure i know), thnx.  Well, ok, on to the journal part of the entry...Um, alot has happened that i refused to type about for some reason.  Antiock on sunday was pretty cool, it was kinda short for me, but i guess cause i was having fun! :D, but anyway, um, that saturday was NUTS.  We ended up chilling and shit.  Theres SOOOO much shit i can say about that day (nothing bad) but i won't, it would juss take to long, so i'll juss do my "highlights" if you will....um, i ordered like, my first thing from starbucks that wasn't advertised on TV. i ordered this double chocolate sticky icky fudge brownie tall Mocha-chino thing....it was damn good.  Um, what else.....Dana licked Kornhouser's nipple.....and mike got freaked out when i put my arm around Steph. (you shoulda have seen his face! it was mad funny).  The first 2 are pretty stright foward, but i feel i should clear up the last one.  See, we were all kinda stuffed in Maryb's car, me, steph (in the middle) and benny were in the back.  Well, during the first part of the night, (the starbucks part) we all had our arms all scrunched up and shit, so i was like, shit, this sucks...well then, i looke over, and ben and steph are in a similar situation.  Well, i guess my horomones were raging, cause then i ask if  can just put my arms around her...not around her body, juss like, around her over the seat......well, yadda, yadda, yadda, i kinda get a feeling she wants me to put my arm around her (forgive me if i'm wrong), so, i did, and lol, thats around the time mike turned around.  Well, ya, it lasted until like, i got dropped off.  Now, lol, if i think i know who's reading this, your gonna wanna know how i felt....well, you know something? i felt pretty damn good.  I mean, maybe it's cause i haven't gone out with anyone for a long time, or maybe it's juss cause it lasted so long, but it juss felt....cool? lol, maybe wrong word, but i dunno, it was juss cool.....what made it COOLER was that i had hardly talked to her during the weekend and what not, we were like juss a noch above aquantices.  Well, since then, we've gotten to know each other better, and i'm even going to her prom....so i think it's safe to say i've reached freind level :o).  But, now that i've answered that little query, i brung up a new one....."so are you gonna go out with her?"....lol, most of my close circle of freinds have asked me that question...and the answer is a simple "i have no idea".....though i haven;t been out with a girl in a while, i'm definitly not juss going to rush into one as soon as i think i have an oppurtunity.....you see, i'm a firm beliver on "juss let things happen", not for alot of situations, but for most, so thats how i want this to go.  If something happnes, it happens, ya know? So, i mean, i guess if something DID happen i'd prolly go out with her....that is if she even likes me, cause i can;t read minds ya know :oD.  Well, ya, so thats that, i mean, nothing more on that i guess....um, maybe i should juss layout my 3 day weekend huh?   Ok, thurs, today, went to school (duh), did the learning thing, and went to mikes after it to get rides.  At first we didn;t get em', but Jones'  dad Hooked me and rob up. um, then, tonight (acutally, like a half hour ago) we go to Jones' for some Risk/Axis and Allies.  The group went as follows: Czank, Me, Jones, Jorge, Mike, Andy, John, Rick, Zach, and some other kid who's name i forgot.  But, unfortunatly, we split up the groups, and each circle was seperated.  Kinda sucked, but dun't matter.  Ok, now TOMMAROW get's complicated.  I have to add before i go on i have A SHIT load of APUSH HW i have to do, but let's continue.  Tommarrow is suppose to go down like this....band practice at someones house for something i can't mention, whihc includes me, hernie, and jorge, and maybe someone else, i have no idea.  Then, later that night, were suppose to get a SHIT LOAD of people to go bowling.  Now, practice is in like morning/afternoon and Bowling is like afternoon/how ever long it lasts.  BUT, today, cause we didn;t go to robs to see the 2 seasons of the critic, and play karoeke revolution, we might do that tomarrow too...and all that leaves NO room for HW.  Saturday should be easier.  I dun think anything is happening in the afterrnoon that i know of, or remember, so that gives me time for HW, but i'm almost positive i'm going somewhere....it always happens like that....but anyways, that night (were talking kinda late) were suppose to go see DAwn of the dead, which is apparently good, with a buncha people, but we still need more cars.  Sunday, in the afternoon i have another driving lesson (i had one today) and then the time between that and Antioch i can do more work.  Then antioch, then home, and school starts the next day.....ya, exciting huh? Well, this is NOT including what the Snow will Due to any of the Carpools....hopefully nothing.  But ya, thas the run-down, it might change, prolly will change, but thats how it looks right now.    new subject, new subject, new subject....hmmm......um.... o yeah, i finally went to the gym today! i felt soooooooooo outa shape, so it felt real good to go back in there.  I wasn;t there for as long as i wanted to be, but i think thats because i wasn't there for so long, and becuase of that i got weaker, and therefor it took less to "work" me out.  but w/e.  My Driving instructor is madd cool.  He's Hispanic, and me being B-lingual really helps....i hate people struggling to speak english.

      UH-HUH-UH-HUH YEAH!! I AM BACK, W00T! AHUH   so yeah, i need a job.  I know i was suppose to get one in healthsmart, like, i KNOW i can get it, but i'm not gonna work there. turns out the people that are going to college also included Claudia....so yeah, definitly not gonna work there.  Did i mention she knows like my WHOLE family? it's fucking crazy, i know.  Like, i think she's had a conversation with all member of my immidiate family.  What my parents, AND her forgot to mention is taht i think 2 of the 4 times, i think she was with her b/f...which completely recks any intentions flowing in my mind.  Ya, my parents love her, they think she's great...BUT, she;s untouchable. so yeah, sucks for me...what i'm i gonna do? cry about it in my blog? (......). So yeah, today i ask Shawna if they're hireing over there in Banna Republic over there in Mount Kisco...she said prolly, and asked if she wanted an application..i was like  YEA BABY!!!  But, then i ALSO realized that it was an all women's store....at first, i thought the immediate "shit, i'm not gonna work there"...but with the help of Brian Wolff, i saw the light...and advantages to working there....thats like working at Armani Exchange if your gay.  But yeah, so i'll see how that goes, prolyl won't go through, but what the hell.  Found my wallet today...well, I didn't, but Jones did...in his couch, where i thought it was....so yeah, thats pretty awsome.  Still had about 12 bucks in there... and my permit, which permits me to drive.....YI PEE!!!  on the subject of wallets....i took my 5 hour yesterday.....now THAT shit is booring.  jorge and Andy came along, so that made it MADD funny.  We got many inside jokes from it, and it was juss an overall good experince.  We acutally ended up staying there for 3 hours, but it felt like 7....lol, hey, 7-3 is 5!.......wait, wtf?  So yeah, can;t wait to drive, but i have to dish out like 365 buvks for the  required  20 hours i have to do.  PLUS, on top of that, i also gotta wait till my dad get's back from ecuador, which should be a week after he leaves, but prolly longer than that.  And cause andy geet;s his car, and Jorge might be getting one, that means the three of us will be the only ones in the school to have Mercedes Benz's.  o yeah....i know your jealous......MUHAHAHAHA  Prom aparently is coming up MADDDDDDD soon, and i totally forgot about.  It dosn't bother me though, i prolly wasn;t gonna go anyway, but it;s the fact that NO ONE asked me....i guess i can;t complain, but i was expecting atleast someone to remind me or something....it's ok though.....next year is going to be the best.....senior prank anyone? hehehehehehhehehee....  I'm going to da movies tonight with rob...we gonna see secret window.  Dun't know who's coming though.  Alot of the guys wanted to go to see this play this kid DAn from antioch is in.  Apperently a good amount of people from antioch are gonna be there, including jorge's girl which will, in part, make him go too.  So yeah.  I  was  gonna go, but than i realized....first) dunt know him too goo second) i wouldn;t like it anyway and third)i hate pina coladas (....)  so yea, but hope them people have fun or what not.  Drove home today, dropped the guys off....i think they were kinda scared, but they still went through it....mad funny   i had a awsome dream last night.  I was, like, doing shit right, and then, there were these two chicks, and i think this other guy ws in the dream to right.  Then all of a sudden i start getting head from this chick, and then i look up, and this guy is getting head too, so my brain triggers the "no co-star" mechanism and then, i'm getting heads from two chicks.....it was soo damn awsome.....i love raviolli.  I realized that i eat alot of wendys, AND subway...whoa  Dispatch is an awsome band, and also, get Lenny Williams - 'Cause i Love you...good song too, funny, but cool  ok, so yeah, i got nothing else to say...hope this entertained you for more than 2 seconds, come back tomarrow when i discuss the smiliarities between aqua man and John Kerry.

      you know, i'm here sitting infront of my computer...doing absolutly nothing....and like always...it get me thinking, and this time, i'm thinking about something wierd.  Like, destiny and shit.  It's so wierd how your entire life can be chnged by one single event....like, let's say i didn;t do this, or never did that....ya know? it;s crazy shit, but when you think like that, your more aware of yout decisions and you become a better person.  Well, ya, thats about...the title, if you haven;t already figured out, is a pick-up line, and no, i'd prolly never use it....well, maybe, but only to make someone laugh.  This brings me to a little saying that i can't stop telling people....it's soo true too...what is it u ask? "Men  always  want what they can't have..." i now in a sense live by this quote....it kinda calms me down when i'm pissed that i don't have a girl. (if you dun wanna read me bitching about  my lady issues, than u can stop here i guess)  It's like, shit.....i juss read jones' blog, and felt sorry for him.  I know he loves her, and to go through that kinda shit really sucks.  Meanwhile, other dilemas occur.  One freind, from what i here, is either already going out with, or is close to going out with this girl he's wanted to for a long time.  Thats great, and i couldn't be happier for him....but everytime i think about it, it makes me get the ol' goosebumps....why can he get a great girl, and me have nothing but my guitar, and my right hand? (sorry, trying to ligten up the mood) so i sit....listen to loves songs i would love to deticate to someone, juss doing nothing but bitch into this thing.  Like i stated in earlier entires, i think my "standards" are too high...  Which brings me to my next thought.....antioch.  See, since the first day, i've asked about the girls there....and now that i know them, i dun do anything....it's not cause i dun want to, it's juss that..well, i dun want to! it's sooo wierd.....like, generally, i would try to do what kornhouser did all weekend....flirt with as many people as posible...but no, nothing.  Maybe time will tell, but for now, i dun know.  wow...that shit was really random. but anyway, ya. i think everyone there is looking for someone, juss hasn;t found em', and when they do go out with each other, it can sometimes lead to hurt, like one freinds went through, which really sucks.  Well, because i have nothing better to do 9i have tons of HW, but i'll do that tomarrow) i juss i'll juss state my opinions of the girls at antioch...not like "o i hate this and that" but like, how i feel about them if i were to be in a relationship with them...if your reading this, and your from antioch, go and tell everyone if you want, i really dun care, this is  my  blog ya now.....well, i guess i'll start off with sara, or however u spell it.....super fun chick, great fun with her, definitly can;t see myself with her...i dunno, maybe it's the whole rock thing, i have no idea....michelle is her equal/better half that is definitly a blast to hang out with...she has a super long tounge, and is always sitting in soe kind of yoga position...can never see myself with her....maybe cause she so old or something, i dunno.....judith is cute, but she might already be going out with a freind, or about to, and i prolly don;t know her enough to really try anything even if i want to, cause i know i don't.  um...shit, fucks this thing, it's taken to long....in a nutshell, i really can't see myself with anyone at antioch....YET...i gues i have to know them better.  Why did i juss type this? to show the world that once again, my chick chances are narrowed down to about nothing.  I would aks some freinds to hook me up with someone or something, but then i dun wanna go on a date where "our mommies' drop us off...i guess maybe thats why i wanna older chick...who knows.    adaskaskdkldhaskddklH!! sorry, i dun know what to do. I kinda got a headache...and i'm alittle down...but what ever.  Time to swtich the subject now....hmmmmmmmmmmm.  i have nothing to say.  I've been playing alot of guitar lately, and proud to say haven;t gone to olda now for about 3 months....helps my ear training. O, i got the info on the Music college of berklee ting or whatever, it;s aHUGE book on everything to do...i'm serioudly considering music tharapy...but thats another story.  what else happen.....did i mention i read jones' blog? i really didn't know he thought of it like that....and i guess i kinda feel the same way he does.  I hope he knows he's still are very best freind, and that the krew ain't going no where. dammit, nothing to say....i guess if anyone reading this (all 4 f you now i think) now someone to hook me upwith i'm all ears....i need a girl dammit.  maybe at antioch i'll start hitting on some chicks....but they all live soooooooooooooo far away.  i think this chick nicole lives in ossining, and thats about it....everyone is mostly in croton which isn;t that bad, and the better ones are father away.  ya.  guess i gotta wait till sunday then.  go to the  urlLink Love Calculator,  it's pretty cool...it may not be 4real, but it's fun.....i typed in alot of chicks names, and lets juss say i didnt fail any of them.....well, wathever, i'm tired....till da next one...

      wow....i have sooooo much to say, yet i don't really want to.  From the looks of it, i'm the only other person acutally attempting to update there blog.  Maybe it was a phase or something for the others, but i know i'm defnintly going to continue putting in entries.  well, let's see...what has happneed worth mentioning....o, well, now that i'm sayig stuff, i must admit i HAVE tried to put in miore entries, but i only have SOO much time anymore to do it, so for now on i'm goin to try to update every weekend or half days (like tomarrow...SCORE) anyway, i guess it's worth mentioning i was SERIOUSLY late for the last 3 days of school last week.  First day cause my parents thought i had an appointment, but didn't, the second cause i acutally had an appointment, and the third, cause....shit, i can't even remember....o yeah! i was trying to put on my contacts that i got the day before, but took too long.  Anyway, after that was the crazy cult meeting of Antioch (hence the title)  Now, let me start off by saying, i really hated the sound of antioch. i mean, everyone that talked about it (rob, jorge, dan) mad it sound like a freaking cult and some kinda sick and demented place...and ofcourse, everyone else (me, andy, jones, and prolly more) were inclined to make fun of it with names like Anticock, and shit like that. Jorge appeared to be cool with it, but i'm sure he wasn't, dan didn;t really care, and rob i think hated it, cause he knew we were making fun of something that we didn;t even know the first thing about. Well, fast foward to last week, and i get a call on the phone, as i'm getting ready to go to the gym.  It's jorge with rob and dan, and they have a "surprise" for me.  Now, when i heard that he was with the other guys, i was thinking the worst...like there with there anitoch buddies to come over and like, do some stupid shit to me....quite the contrary though.  They dropped off one of the most important permission slips of my life.   They needed more people for the antioch weekend, and me being there freind, and them thinking i would atleast enjoy it, came and dropped of the sheet asking me to come.  The cost was 45 bucks, and from what i read, not worth it.  But throughout the week, i found out that more freinds were going, and that ofcourse, made me wanna go.  By friday, a large cirlce of freinds have already heard of what was going down, and wanted to come along as well, but they didn't go, the slips were do that tuseday or soemthing.  well, ya, like i said, totally negative feelings for the place, and juss all that mess.  That week i had also been to the gym every single day, and friday wasn;t an exception.  I got there with an hour to sepnd, 5 to six.....which would give me am hour to pack, and get over there.  I get that done (barely) and call andy for a ride....u see, at the gym he said if i needed one, to catch one with him.  So, itook him up on the offer, and got over there.  I rang the door bell like 5 times, and didn't get any response.  I saw both of his cars, and his lights and tv on, but none of them acutally in the house.  I thought they juss left, and took his dads summer car out for a spin, so, kinda dissapointed, i go over to brassier swiss to use the pay phone to call my dad who juss dropped me off, to come pick me up.  Well, i know, i know, i didn;t know how to get there, but before i called andy, i called jorge, and he gave me failry easy directions to get there, so i did.  we drive, and sure enough, i happen to see a school through the trees, and i knew it was it, my dad had even been there before, so everything went fine...i was alittle late, but not compared to some other people. I get there, and its juss awsome.  If you didn;t already know, i love the public, and i juss love bieng with and infront of people.  I go in there with a vengence, and meet like, prolly most of them.  Acouple i stayed away from, i was kinda shy and/or not paying attention to them.  But ya, it turned out great.  We had to go around doing some stuff....im not gonna say wat, cause that would ruin the next one for whoever wants to go.  After that, we go to a our designated sleep groups to go to our guest house.  We had the smallest sleep group with 3, me, vinny, and Gonzalo.  It was real cool....we didn;'t have as much fun as i thought we were, but none-the-less, great times.  Next day, realy early, like 7, the day started again.  This time, it kinda freaked me out.  See, we have to hold hands, and sing woreshipping songs, and at first, i not only felt left out, and freaked out, but also like i had to get outa there.  After that, a person goes up to do a talk about a certain subject that they were giving.  Rob's had to be the mot entertaining, and is was about how god has chosen us for certain things. After talks we go to ur discussion groups, and talk answer questions and discuss things on kinda the same subject the talk was on.  Well, once again, my group was the smallest, but still awsome, kayci acutally headed it up, and we were  always  the first one done...so we played basketball till someone told us to stop, and go back to the talk room and do it all over again. Thats pretty much the jist of it...i'm not gonna type anymore cause it'll juss ruin it i guess...it didn;t ruin the experince for me even though i knew alot of things, but i dun wanna make it a habit to tell everyone...well, ya, during that whole thing, you change.  You leave with soooooo much knowledge, and so many new feinds, and so many new ways to look at people, it really was a awsome time, no matter what i thought about it in the beggining.  Still don't belive me? well, let me share a moment that happened to that with out a doubt gave me some closure.  It was confessional time, where preists come for you to go, and confess, or juss to talk.  I of course, loving and for of opinions, wanted to go, but i had no idea what to say, i really didn;t have anything to confess....it prolly would have taken awhile anyway....i need something to ask him, something i needed to have answered, and i thought it....i needed  faith . i needed something.  U see, all the stuff they were saying, i already did, but i would NEVER connect ANYTHING with god, or let alone any kinda religion, and being there made me want to see what i really wanted.  well, i walk in, and juss begin to cry my eyes out...i felt sooooooo lost....i told him, i need some kind of faith, some guidance...i had nothing...he asked me if i loved anyone....i said (barely...i litterally couldn;t talk i was crying so much) that ofcourse i did, my parents, and my brothers.  He then asked me if i had faith  in them,  and i said yes.  He then asked me, why do i love them, how do you get to love someone, and i answer you have to know them first....and thats when it hit me....he told me to have faith in something, more specifically this religion, i have to get to know it, i have to understand it, i have to love it first.  He told me to read the gospel of luke first, very slowly, and soak up everything.   I still haven;t done it, but that definitly ggave me some closure.  i walk back, and tell sabby and i think mike about what happend.  I see this spanish chick i haven;t met yet, and juss sit next to her...i asked if she's ok, cause she had her head down, and after that we juss talked....for a LONG time...it was incredible, this girl is the completly TOTAL package, it's the most amazing thing i had ever seen in my life....but what amazed me the most was that i wasn't even intrested in doing something wiht her...i juss wanted to talk....sure i kinda got close, and RALLY felt like making out with her, but i mean, i was so caught up in the conversation, that was like, not even worth it.  Well, i call a freind over, to meet this truly amazing girl, and he too is amazed.....i'm positive he has feelings for her, and rightfully so, they do have ALOT in common.  I wasn't mad or something evenm though i kinda liked her too...i guess i juss excepted that he'll  be a better match them me.  Anyway, i hope he gets what he wants, cause that would be awsome. and no, i'm not gonna tell you who it is....but ya, thats juss one example of  many  that i could mention.  I mean, the whole place is filled with love....if somoene is crying, everyone goes and gives him/her a hug, and it's juss that kinda atmosphere.  I would explain some of the amazing stuff that happened, but we all excepted a confidentiality rule that i won't break...so sorry.  Any way, fast foward to today, and more stuff happens.  We go to the croton diner where they always go after a weekend to juss chill some more, and relax...ya, we were skipping school....but it didn;t matter.  After that, we decide to go to the dam, cause that's also tradition.  We make a quick stop at this kid's derek's house, then get there.  we kinda juss hang around, and then decide to go to croton point park.  On the way back, we stop by dereks again, and head out.  half way going in, we see michelle drive past us, going outa the park, we asked what was going on, and it turned out a frind had gotten into a accident.  We head over there, kinda worried, and make it.   We find out that it wasn;t nearly as bad as we thought, but the driver was still severly shaken by the whole event.  Well, after that, we relaxed, and decided to head over to jorges.  And well, we do, all of us get there, and we juss chill, some listne to music upstairs, others play games downstairs, juss stright foward chillen. i had to go alittle early for a dentist appointment, which litterally took like 3 seconds, and then ate at the chinese place....my mom leaves cause she has to, and leave me and my little brother alone...he ends up walking to his freinds house, and i walk home, fairly quikly, trying to get home to call jorge, to maybe get a ride, so i can continue to chill.  Well, everyone left, and now i'm here, typing this.....but even me being back home still hasn't changed the extreme changes i have gone through.  I'm a firm beliver of astrology, and today was such a confirmation that it was true...to atleast a certain extent....let me give you the examples.  I go to  urlLink Astrology Online  and see there horoscope for libras.....here's what it said...   LIBRA  (Sept. 24 -Oct. 23)   Your support and concern will help. You may want to make changes in your home environment. Be cautious while traveling to foreign countries.   this blew my mind.....the support and the concern did help.  i do want to change my home enviorment, and i was suppose to be going to ecuador in like 2 weeks.....competely freak me out....being skeptical, i go to another site,  urlLink Astrology.com  to check out what they had.....and it totally confirmed it....

      yes, yes, yes....i finally decide to update, i have many reasons for not updating, and you know what? I think i'll just share em' with you  I've been REALLY busy lately.  My grades haven't exactly been to hot, and this bieng like the most important year, i have to shape up.  Um, well, it's that, and the fact that i'm just lazy...no, really.  And, um, and prolly cause i had no material, i mean, what am i going to do, just describe my day, everyday? (wait a minute...) Well, anyway, ya, i've got some new shit to share, but before i continue, i have to say, i woke up at like 6 this morning, so i'm  seriously  tired....but i'll do my best to share what i so foundly call....my thoughts....o, and ya, im tired, so sorry about the typos.   yeah, um, i'll start with today.  O man.  Forget it, i mean, it's nothing special, i can't really comment on anything important other than the fact that today is Prom....well, it's a banquet, but everyone is treating it like a prom.   Basically, everyone's there right now, as i'm typing this.  Now,  Why didn't you go steven?  well, there's exactly 5 reasons why i didn't go.    1. I was Confused:  Ok, so i had NOOO idea when it was, like, no idea.  and i didn't feel like asking anyone cause i thought they wouldn't know, and even if they did, i  probably  wouldn't go.   2. By the time i Found out, it was to late: ok, so when i DID find out, it was too late.  Like, i knew i wasn't gonna have anytime to do anything.  The limo's, in all there splender were probably all taken, and even if they weren't, i wasn't gonna pay it all myself.  And all the people that i probably could have had, already had planned out what was gonna happen...and, well, that leads to number 3...  3.  No dates:  Like i said, it was already to late to do anything, cause everyone had already made thier plans, including  dates.  So even if i did go, i would have gone with someone i didn;t really like, which means i wouldn't enjoy myself as much as i know i would.  4. Already going to an   Actual   Prom:  If you didn't know, me and Steph (a freind from antioch, more on her below) are going to her Senior prom.  And unlike the Junior-prommers tonight that have NOTHING to do, my evening on that night is suppose to be awsome..so let's hope...Ya, and because i'm already going to another prom, it leads to my last, and final exuse...  5. Don't wanna spend more cash for nothing:  I gotta pay for a lot of shit dammit!  And my hispanic ass ain't about to go dish out some cash for two things at once, especially if i know one isn't gonna be worth it...but why don't i get a suit like the other guys, and just do it..?  HELL NO, i gotta do my shit right, ok? I go the whole 9 yards when i play dress up, NOTHING is over looked...when u see me, i'm gonna make u say "holy shit", and NOT in a bad way...i ain't about to go wear a fucking 100 dollar suit when i can roll up in a jaw dropping tuxedo.  And shit, i technically wouldn't even be paying for it! My dad will, and he's spent way to Much on my mercedes for me to be asking for more...so THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!   ok, yeah, there you go, those are my reasons.  So instead of going to the prom, i go watch Kill Bill Vol. 2 with David, Rob, Benny, and Robs dad, who drove us...i must say, it was quite the change of the "usuals"...david hardly ever joins us, and Benny is usually with the "d&d" side of my freinds.  So yeah, pretty cool.  We didn't talk as much..perhaps cause we were soaking in that great film and all, but what ever, good times.  Randomly in the middle of this like, slow, "stalking" kinda scene, this random guy yells "OH DEAR" and the whole damn theater cracks up...very comical.  But yea, nothing special after that.  We sit through ALLLLLLL of the credits, which is like, literally, fucking 20 minutes, and watch the little snipit thats at the end....and it's like, all of 2 seconds....definitly not worth it, but hey, atleast now we can say we saw it...but yeah, here i am, NOT at Prom.  I guess i should just describe what everyone else is doing right now....  Mike V.:  He's at Prom.  He's sharing a limo with Kornhauser, and acouple other people tonight.  He said they got a jacuzzi in there, but i'll belive it when i see it.  He went with emily.  Um, i have no idea what there doing after the prom...prolly just chilling, but thats just a wild guess...  Sabby: Prom.  His date with some chick Natalie came through, so he's happily over there.  I have NO idea what he could be doing, cause he didn't mention it, but he's prolly chillin with the jock crowd, or the WAY-TO-HISPANIC crowd.  Healy: No idea.  He was like the only other person we knew wasn't going to prom, but rob mention he was going somewhere.  No idea where he is...he could be dead for a we know, and we would NEVER KNOW!!! MUAHAHAHAHHAHAA!!!! (...)  Jones: Prom. (?)  Yea, i have a question marl for many-a-reason.  You see, if u didn't know, him and sheel broke up, for good now so i hear, so my, and i'm pretty sure everyone else's thoughts were that he, well, WON'T go to prom.  Well, just the other day, while i mention aloud that he's one of the free guys tonight, he corrects me saying he is, in fact, going!  i immediatly ask who, because i mean, i don't know!  You see, lately, Rob and andreas feel he's separating himself from the "krew"  I whole hartedly diagree, but in any sense, NONE of us really know what he does.  But yeah, he tells us, and it ends up being Katie, of the Nalven Kind.  And let me be the first to say  AWSOME!  I think thats the PERFECT date from him.  Hes always told me how they were freinds, and how she's like the one he can talk to about everything, so off the bat she's awsome, BUT, from all i hear (which isnt bad at all) she's always like, the life of a party, which is awsome!  I think they'll have alot of fun tonight, and even if they don't, SOMETHING is bound to happen.    Jorge: At the Ms's.:  Jore headed over to good ol' Eastchester today.  Here's how the plan was suppose to go down.  He's going up there to see Judith's (thats her name) play at school.  Scott is going too.  (Her and Scott are good freinds, and knew each other before Jorge and her started to go out)  Now, from what i hear, it ends late, and i don't know if thats the reason for this or not, But Jorge is sleeping over!  isn't that awsome?!! O man, this is soo crazy, like, everything were used to is changing! it's a fucking revolution!  Like, jorge was always seen as the "ugly, skinny, shy, self-doubting" guy, but NOW look at him! He's fucking going out on dates, SLEEPING OVER GIRL's HOUSES?!?! i mean, holy shit!! whats going on!? lol, but no, i'm really happy for jorge, i think he needed a loving relationship with someone like he's in right now, so ya, i wish him the best of luck with him and Judith.  Well, anyway, ya, here's probably there right now, doing they "dirty", (haha) but ya, thats where he is.  Hernie: Prom.  I have no idea what he's doing, but from what he told us, he's at the prom too.  Andy: Work.  Andy's handeling his business right now, so i don't think he was going to the prom.  But yeah, he's working right now, and will probably head home soon.  Everyone else: Most likely at Prom.  Giving that i'm tired, i can't really remember everyone else, but i do know their most likely at prom.  *If what i said happend, DIDN't Happen, sorry, i only typed what i heard...*  so yeah, acouple of things happened during typing this..andy got back, and Hernie came only, which means he's home..or atleast, someone is using his s/n.  but yeah, all this talk about prom has got me thinking about the one i'm going to, the one with steph.  Now, here's the thing with steph.  everyone seems to think were gonna go out and shit, but lemme be the first to tell you, i doubt it's gonna happen.  now, don't get me wrong, i love her! she's awsome! she's great! but, i juss don't think she's my type.  And no, it's not physical, so let's not go there.  I mean, i need someone out going, fun, i mena, i juss want someone...i dunno....i acutally don't know what i want.  Maybe i don't know her enough, but i mean, from the looks of it, it's not going to go anywhere past best freinds.  I dunt call her enough anway :d! lol, no, i've called her, but like, only twice, and like, they were on the same day, and both about getting a ride to antioch....so yea, kinda bad.  And from *a little birdy* i think she kinda likes me....which is kinda bad for me.  And i know it's kind of my fault.  You see, when i get confortable around people, i tend to  try  and flirt with every girl.  ANd it's totally subconscience by the way.  So i think i've been doing that alot, which is stupid, considering my position on the whole thing.  Well, i haven't spoken to her in a while, so i'm gonna call her tomarrow.  I was suppose to call her today, but i flat out forgot (like always).  And juss for the record, i'm not scared or anything, if thats what people think, i honestly forget.  Anway, you see, when i dropped off Andy, he told me she got back from her restreat thing, and told me to call her...so i was like, sure, i will.  So i turn on my computer to get the number, check the mail, you know the deal...but then, i start doing the astrology thing, playing video games and shit, and completly forget...then i go to my parents bed, and sleep till like 5:30, when rob calls, saying were going to the movies.  So, then, i was there till almost 11, and here i am now....so yeah, i'll call her tomarrow...i am her date anyway right?? lol, ya, and plus i gotta tell her about my tuxed situation.  So tomarrow will definilty be a talk day.  Well, ok, the time is now 12:15, and i have NOOOO more left in me to type.  All i can say is thnx to dave for letting me borrow his copy of Akira.  I'll watch it as soon as i can.  And, um, thanx to whoever read this whole this.  Well, i'm gonna go off and try to have a Lucid dream...bye bye  (Kill bill Vol 2 was FUCKING AWSOME by the way..you should go see it...)

      yea..um, ok, let's see, what can i type to entertain the 6-10 of you that acutally stop by.....um...ok, well, we went to Jones' house for a BBQ.  It was a pretty good time acutally.  Acutally, it was alittle more than that..so yeah, after that, i came back home, and just went to sleep.  I dunno, it might have been just me, but there was just....this  something  about it.  I mean, nothing really went wrong, ya know? sure i was late...and sure we had  ALOT  more fries than needed, but i mean, shit, it all came together.  Now, i don't know who put in what amount of money....i'm asumining mike and ben didnt put anything into it, but i could be wrong.  I myself, bought 3 sodas, i'm pretty sure Andy hooked us up with the broatworst, sabby with meat, Czank i'm guessing with the patatoes, and Dan with everything else.  And shit people, i don't really know why, but it just felt soo good to chill like that right? i mean, just relaxing, cooking, conversing, having a good time and shit, i mean, it was awsome.  And what was even better (and maybe kinda worse) about it was that ben and czank were there! i only say worse, cause it seems like we've eliminated the one key member of the krew, Rob, and replaced them with ben and Czank.  This whole vacation has been rob free so far.  We've known were he was though...apperently checking out colleges and shit.  But yeah, atleast he;s doing something productive....so far i've been out everyday since last friday..i'm surprised i even have money left.  Um, ya, just to reiterate, it was a breath of fresh air to just be chilling like that how we kinda used to do...Well, ya, during that, i acutally go tthe car, and jorge went to go drop me off to get it...along the way his mom called, and said something was up, but it appeared to be cool.  Anyway, i went back to dans, where the guys were doing NOTHING.  Before, we were gonna visit a freind steph were she worked in verplanck, so we said we were leaving...the guys looked dissapointed and shit, but honestly, they had to have realized that there was nothing to do...anyway, sorry for any dissapointments and shit...  Well, we spend like an hour looking for the place, have many inside jokes i guess, and ya, i  mean it eas pretty random.  That night, i shill with steph, sabby, and andy and Sabby's place until like 11...nothing really special, but good times none-the-less.    Um, oo, by the looks of it, i didn't really said what i did in the last post.  My dad ended up letting my borrow the car, and me, andy, and sabby headed over to the Premier athletic club over there in Montrose.  Now, alot of shit happened, so let me explain from the begging.  See, since last sunday we were planning to go right? so when the day came, steph calls, giving me the low-down on whats gonna happen, and she asked if i need i ride...i was like "no, i'll drive there" cause, of course, i wanted to drive there.  Now, the plan was that my mom was going to come home with the van, i get it, and pick up sabby and andy to go.  Well, i guess i shoulda have asked my mom first, cause she was gonna be in college until like 11...so yeah, pretty screwed, THEN, i was like, wait, i can get my dads car! but i had to wait until he got there, at around 6:30...well, he gets there, i pick the guys up, i miss the first exit, and we finally get there...like an hour and a half late.....yeah, it sucked...but we got there, and it was just like Club fit in briacliff....a pretty boy's club.  there was like NO ONE at the bench press area and shit....just pathetic....i didn't lift cause i had already previously did, so i went to the leg press, and couldn't even do 4 45 pounders on each side!! My legs' have seriously gotten weak, but i'll try to fix that during the summer.  Anyway, um, ya, so we stayed there for only about an hour....Christina had to go and what not, and we just left...we followed her, and dropped her off, then followed steph to get back home...my dad was alittle mad, but it's cool.     ok, so what gonna happen today? Well, jorge wanted to see if we can get a jam session going on, but by the looks of it, it ain;t happening, and steph, and Andy and i think some others want to go to to Priemir again, but i dun really want to go.....plus i still have to atleast try and do my HW....so yeah, i have no idea whats  gonna happen....but we'll see....ok, i might update later today...peace

      well, if you didn't already read my entry below, it was very long, and very pointless....you see, i've noticed something, i don't rant alot.  Most of these entries has been random entries on waht i did, and little side notes and shit.  And you know why?  Cause i don't really have anything to rant about....i mean, sure shit pisses me off, or makes my head think, but it's never anything serious.  Like that whole Passion movie, i'm sure millions of people online ranted thier fucking mouths off about it....it's almost like your required to rant about that movie now....for me? naw...not worth the time and effort.  i rather be ranting about how fucked up this country is.  I mean, think about it....look how much money is going in Beauty products....billions of dollars, and when a harmless add comes on tv, like 1 in 4 acutually call...come on now people, what the fuck man, you cant possibly have 3 bucks to spend somewhere else....or how bout all the fucking Media, and how it controls our lives, ever think of that shit?  Everything revolves around media now, no matter what form it's in, and it;s really controlling how we think.  Don't belive me? Go watch fucking Bowling For Columbine, the best fucking documentary i've ever seen.  That'll open yours eyes....Look, i'm sorry people, but if you haven;t got it by now, i'm kinda fustrated.....no, acutally, i just wanted to waste time....lol, ya, sorry, i wasn't gonna beak down or anything....well, peace out, i once again have a pretty busy day, bye bye

      Ok, sit back, and relax people. cause this is gonna be my longest post to date...a culmination of Friday-Monday....one of the CRAZYIEST weekends i have ever had in my life....   Ok, let's start off with acouple of days ago...with Box City.  What is box city you ask? Well, let me tell you timmy:  Box city is thing thing the antioch people do on the side to help people understand what it's like to be homeless.  It's called Box City cause we all had to bring boxes (though we didn't have to).  Well, ya....MANY, and i mean MANY people couldn;t go, which was sad, but they missed out....and for those that did, here it is, the complete synopsis of how it went from the earliest i remmeber.  And yea, it's basically all gonna be in "parts".    Part 1:  The Beginning  Ok, so the day went pretty crazy.  School was very boring, and the fact that i didn't have a box for the night was messing with my head.  Well, mike was apparently going for his own reasons, so we decided to go to his house to plan out what we were going to do.  Well, we didn't because............ummmmmmmm............shit, i forget, but it's along the lines of "someone is getting us boxes".....yeah, that sounds about right....anyway, ya.  um, so i get home eventually....o yeah! i remember now, my mom was at a tai Chi Lesson (don't ask), and she was going to pick me up at mikes...OOOOOOO, and  JONES  said he had boxes for us...there we go... ok, so yeah, o, and while at mikes, his mom said he couldn't go to box city...which sucked, but ok.  So yeah, i go to Jones' house to go and pick up the boxes....at first everything look perfectly fine, no problems at all....we go into his garage, and the first thing that caught my eyes was the 5-7 Refrigerator boxes....i'm thinking 'FUCK YEAH!!' cause refrigerator boxes are like, the Mansions of Carboard houses.  Well, to much dissapointment, they were off-limits, and i guess i can understand that.....but THEN, he brought me to the boxes he was giving out......they were all like little kitchen appliance boxes, it was crazy, SO YEAH, i get the biggest box, and thank him.....it's not his fault, he tried....anyway, after some debate, i head over to that shopping place where the Food emporium is, and go behind radio shack, and pick up some big ass boxes and shit, it was fucking awsome.  BUT ANYWAY, after that, i head home, and everything went hectic.  I was doing to much shit, but i eventually got there....and whoa....    Part 2:  The Beggining Part 2   so i get there, and the first thing i see is Rob, Chris, Kayci, and Emily.  i unload, blah, blah, blah, then Mike J. tells us to go to the front, where people can see us....so we move all our shit there, and we start building our shit.  um, around that time, Mary beth and sara show up in Mar's car. We set up her's, and mary's boxes, and one extra....whoever got there first, michelle or steph.   Um, ya, so during that whole time, we played cards, have good conversations, and just had a pretty chill time...until...THE NEXT PART    Part 3:  Time-Killerz   OK, so Michelle ended up getting there first, so obviously, the box i so *skillfully* made was hers.  Ok, now lemme see if i can remember.....i think we all just started running around, starting random little conversations, um, played some mow-mow, and then, out of now where, a very kind lady, who i'm sorry i didn't catch her name...stopped by with Coffee and Pizza...ya, i thought it was a pretty bad combo too, but hey, it was still an amazingly sweet gesture.  So, not wanting torisk the posibility of me throwing up, i ended up taking the Coffee.  Ok, so what happened next? well, Michelle went to her box for a while....she was alittle  out of it if you know what i mean...so yeah, and the rest of us just ended up having a pretty intresting conversation...and by intresting, i mean conversations where i can express what i know, feel, or think about a subject....the subject? Dreams of course....i don't know what my addiction to them is...i mean, i want to have SO much more than i know of....My main goal is to become a  Lucid  dreamer...basically, being able to recoknize that i'm dreaming with out waking up, and pretty much be able to do whatever you want....i've been close....very close, i acutally think i did it once, but i still want more ya know?  Well, anyway, we discussed alittle bit, and eventually we all decided that we should go to our boxes.....O! and at that time, Suzanne went to go Pick up steph at the train station...it was around 10:10 i think.   Part 4:  Fast Times at Hobo-High  so we get back to the boxes, and immediatly we start chillen.  it took sometime to move everything around..you know, cause we were going to make a circle in which we all face each other, pretty streight foward.  Well, ok, so i think some time goes back, the jokes here and there, you know, the main stuff.  O, i must mention kayci, emily, and dan G. weren't part of the circle, they decided to go off to the side, where no one could talk to them.....well ANYWAY.....um, by this time, rob went in his box, and NEVER came out....he was the first one to hit the hay in the circle, leaving just me and Chris the only guys left in the circle....well, ok, so, ya, um, during that whole thing, we were just having random conversations.....and, during one point, well, most of it acutally, michelle was complaining about her box, and how her ass was juss to big, and she really couldn't do anything.  Juss to tease her, i kept on saying how my love box (my box had four names: Steve's Box-o-Love, Box city number 4 i think, the centipede, and some chick parmagiana thing rob made up...) was awsome, and how confortable it was....well! there came a time when i had to leave to go to the bathroom, and the girls minus Marybeth decided that was a perfect time to enter my box...lol, it was acutally pretty cause i ran down there, KNOWING they were gonna do that, but they started as SOON as i got out, so i literally saw them go in.....well, i decide to let them do it, and when i come up, i see that, indeed, Steph, Michelle, and Sara had ALL stuffed themselves in my box-o-love.  Well, since i new they prolly gonna take alittle bit of time, i decided to get into Michelle's box juss to see what all the fuss was about....and HOLY SHIT, that shit was the biggest piece of shit box i have ever been in...i ashamed myself buy even helping to build it, so when the ladies got out, i decided to tell Michelle, that if she wanted to, she could sleep in my box, (and no, i wasn't thinking with my dick...she goes with someone anyway, so let's not go there....) and she took me up on that offer.  So, i mean, at first, it was pretty streight foward....we did the whole, backwards-fowards thing, like her feet where by my head, and vice versa.  Well, already, i hated sleeping like that, so i was feeling kinda weird, but then she eventually turned around so we were face to face.  You see, wha happened was, sara, for some reason i forgot, began to gave me an AMAZING hand massage...i'm talking COMPLETELY incredible and message here....it was awsome...so yeah, i tried to get smilez off of people, and it worked, but what was funny was, that michelle didn't know what was going on, so she would always ask whats going on right? well, NO ONE could understand her, let alone myself who was in the same box!  so yeah, she eventually turned around after acouple of us told her she's missing out.  Anyway, at this time, steph get's into it, and we make it a  "competition" to see who has the best one....well, ya, sara gives me one on my right, steph on my left....sara one, but i think only cause she's used to it....stephs was still good though.  anyway, ofcourse, the thought of "how ever will you pay us back" came up...so, back massage came up..well, when sara and michelle went to the bathroom, and steph was left, i decided to go on with the back massage....and yes, this further planted the fact that everyone thinks were eventually going to hook up...well....i dunno.....more on that further down....well, yeah, sara and mich came back, but sara didn;t want one, and by then, my trying to message got me tired....so i just got into the box....after that, we listened to my Ipod some more (which i forgot to mention above, sorry) and just chilled.   So yeah...that went on for awhile, and, yeah, just little random stuff in between.  This kid kept on calling michelle, and causeing some drama, which was pretty funny.  See, she didn't have good reception, so everytime she picked up, she was like "hello?? Hello?!?" like 10 times, than hung up....that happned for awhile...but eventually stopped....but what happened after that you ask? lemme tell ya...   Part 5:  Confession from a box  Alot of random shit happened between that.  Um, it's kinda scarmbled cause we were all trying to go to sleep.  You see, by this time, Chris was knocked out, and snoring in these wierd ass patterns and shit, so we kept on laughing and shit.  Well, ya, so me and michelle were basically just chillen in the box...at one point Steph got in the box, which was VERY intresting....lol, ya, it was a threesome in the box...but evetually, she decided that she couldn;t be in there any longer, and then she went back to her box....but how did i feel about being in the box with michelle? allow me to indulge you...Let me just start off by saying i think Michelle is just amazing, simply put.  She's everything i'm looking for in a girl...minues the smoking part, but i even look over that, she's completely incredible.  And yeah, if that makes you think that i like her, i guess your right...but i'm definitly not trying anything...she already goes out with someone, and i dun even think she like me back...all i'm trying to say is that Michelle is definitly my type.  AWSOME, AWSOME person.  playful, funny, pretty damn good looking, older, i mean, shit i could be here for hours.  But yea, now that i got that off my chest.  Nothing really happned in the box.  I could have started convo's and shit, but then everyone would have heard, so i couldn't really talk about anything. We always moved around and shit, that was *fun*....it was kinda hard to sleep when you have someone else in the same box and shit...well, yeah, that was pretty mch the whole time. The only other thing i could mention was the way she was acting.  I know she goes out with someone, and i know she knows that i know, thats why it was alittle unconfortable.  I noticed acouple of times she was gonna put her arm on me or something, and then she didn't do it...which i completly understand....but all i'm saying is, i would have thought NOTHING of it, and it would have been a HECK of a more confortable time.....but as for  thoughts about it, i mean, what can i say. It was my first time sleeping with a girl....not romatically or anything, but ya.  And i gotta tell you...i mean, on the outside, it's not a big deal and everything, but now that i think about it, its like whoa, i  slept  with this girl....lol, kinda get's a smile on my face..lol, but ya, good times...  I guess a very easy way of explaining how i felt during the whole thing is to listen to the first part  of  "Overkill" by Men At Work.  I completly sums it up...well, atleast the First verse.    Part 6:  The Next Morning...  So, this was the worst part of it all....first off, i didn't really get alot of sleep, so that was bad, you see, i woke up to just about every voice i head that night, and seeing how basically sara was up all night, so was i....well, yeah, anyway, whem i woke up the first time in the morning, it was now raining pretty hard...nothing serious, but more that it was....i do that "mm, dammit" noise, and look up.....Apparently Mike J. saved all our stuff by convering our stuff with cardboard and shit...thanx mike....anyway, while i looked around i notice some blus liquid coming through.  It was litterally three inches away from me and michelles faces....   i think by this time, after alot of random things, Chris wakes up (finally) and mentions that it's already 6:20....we only had to be there until like 6, so..WE WERE DONE! at this time, everyone notices the blue shit, and unfortunatly, my ;illow soacked up most of it...and so did michelles....along with her $300 dollar north face...sorry bout that..anyway, turns out, all that decorating with robs  black marker, was acutally  blue.  so, um, yeah.  Well, we eventually all got out of the boxes, and fixed our shit together, and began collapsing the boxes.  Some ladt stopped by with her pick-up, and offered to help us bring all the boxes down to the dumpsters.  Well, we loaded it all up, then ran down back around back, and unloaded it.  By this time, i called my mom to come pick me and rob up....see, it was a pretty miserable day...so, we really wanted to get away.  Well, after that, mike asks us if we wanna go to the diner, and eat breakfast, but i said no, cause my mom was already gonna pick us up...Chris had left by then, and Dan G. had been gone since 5 that morning...so yea.  Now that i think about it though, i really should have gone,  but coulda-woulda-shoulda i guess right?  So yeah, we drop rob off, and then me and my mom headed over for some quick eats at mcdonalds.  I got back home, brushed the teeth, ate, changed clothes, and juss collapse on my bed...softly smiling thining about the simply awsome time i had...till i woke up that is....   Part 7:  The New Adventure.   Ok, satuday was kinda a blur to me now that i think about it, but i'll try my best.  I know i woke up pretty late.  I think andy called once, and so did sabby, but thats all i remmeber.  I mean, nothing much happened in the time i was at my house.  My mom went to go do the laundry or something, and O! at that time, i realized my Dads car has a flat, which sucks...but more on that later.  Well, ya, during that day, Jorge randomly calls, asking me if i want to go to Hernie's house to jam, (this goes back to the antoch thing) so ofcourse, i was like "hell yeah".  i mean, no one else said anything was going on, and Rob cancelled the Party. (You see, we were going to celebrate the aniversery of the ghetto Super Heros, but he was just to tired, so he moved it back...we have YET to have it...) So, jorge showed up, and i loaded up my gear.  I get there, and it was pretty strieght foward.  we started jamming, and all that shit, i mean, it was kinda slow at first, but eventually it started to get alittle more instresting.     Part 8:  Wait, whats going on?  Ok, so we jam, i mean, nothing big about that....i mean, i guess the only thing i could say is it was good to just get together and jam like that.  Well, after that, Sabby get's there, i learn Scott is coming, and yaneris get's home too.  By this time, we all juss started chillen, nothing big...i was getting pretty damn tired, and, ya.  We eat chinese at some point, but i forget exactly when....i think before sabby got there.  Eventually, Yanaris sends us out to rocky's deli, and we obey, and head over...we get some stuff, than came back..  Acouple minutes after that, we got a call, and scott was there..now, earlier, sabby wanted to go over to eastchester to go visit judith, jorge's G/f.  Well, after making some calls and shit, we decide to acutally go ahead, and go to eastchester.  Well, ya, after some  debate, we start on our way..we decide to take the van he had.  But that ended up being crazy too.   Part 9:  Houston, we have a problem...  So, yeah, at first, i was like, drop me off home....so we go to my house, and drop off my shit...i stay for a bit, and decide to go with the guys (i was VERY tired by the way).  My mom acutally stops by, and we say hi and waht not.   But yeah, after that, we were on a epic quest to find gas....and GOOD LORD did we have trouble.  We ended up going back to hernies, going online to see waht gas station is open, and all that shit.  Anyway, Scott and jorge check it out, it was cool, and soon enough, we were on our way...me more tired than ever.  But ya, eventually, we fixed the problem, and soon began.   Part 10:  Holy shit this is alot...  Ok, we finally go..we stop by 7-11, and go on the long, trechurus (i know i spelled that wrong....to tired to fix) and we finally get there..so random shit happend in the car along the way, convo's and stuff, but nothing worth really mentioning.  We finally get there, and it's like, 4-5 oclock.  We just basically talked..nothing more...there was no reason to be there at all, but we where there.  anyway, after blowing off about an hour, we start heading home, and yes, the suns coming up....we get home at aroun 6-30...stay up till about 7, when everyone kinda woke up again, and then i got dropped off back home for some more sleepage... It was MADE fun though....only problem was that i was working on VERY little sleep....staying awake pretty much all of box city, and then staying up all night and day took it's toll.....i then got home and finalyl slept.   Part 11:  Sundays rolls around.  So sunday came...it was suppose to be a big day ya know? I had my first talk, so i was kinda nervous, and i mean, it was just suppose to be fun.  hernie and Jorge were going on a double date, and were going to miss it, but it's cool, no big deal.  So yeah, that day i pretty much stayed home....slept late and what not, and i think somethign else happned, but pretty much was at home.  Steph once again comes and gives me a ride...so i was pretty thankful for that.  Well, she picks me and sabby up, and we head over to the church.  We had some time to kill, so we stopped by the pizza place for some food.  After that, we head down, and by then, most people are there.  I wander around, just going here and there, and eventually i start chillen at a corner with rob, joe, adn some others when Suzanne and Mike said there was some money missing...now i juss think thats about one of the worst things i have ever heard....i mean, this money, about 50 bucks, was going to help people in africa with thier water situation, and some fuck head goes along, and steals like 38 bucks from it.  really fucked up....and just acouple of minutes ago i got a email from Suzanna saying someone stole her Wallet too...seriously fucked up shit to do to some very very nice people.  Well, yeah....um, i mean, we sat down and i did my talk....and just if you missed it, i'll post it up right now, just to show you:      The Talk   Love. The four little letters that has done so much on this earth.  All it is is  2 vowels, 2 consonants, and an endless supply of meaning.  Dictionary.com defines it as;  “A deep, tender, ineffable feeling of affection and solicitude toward a person, such as that arising from kinship, recognition of attractive qualities, or a sense of underlying oneness.”  But what is love? Can we really define it? How can you describe when a person is so utterly perfect in your eyes, and you to them, you can’t stand to be a minute away from each other, when you’ve met someone for 3 seconds, and it’s felt like 4 years, how do you describe that gut feeling, that “thing” about him/her, the feeling of absolute love.  Well, I know I can’t describe it, but I can sure say it, and I’m sure many of you say all the time.  Think about your first love….wasn’t it amazing?  I mean, just the whole “knowing you mean something to someone other than your family” is so beautiful.  And even if you never went out with that person, it’s still a great thought huh? Love is a beautiful thing shared by 2 people who, well, love each other! I mean, it doesn’t get any better than that, 1+1= 2 right?  When your in love, you can say whatever you want, you can go anywhere, do anything.  I’m sure it’s different for everyone, after all, I think Sly and the Family Stone said it best when they said “Different Strokes for Different Folks”. But, I think I can speak for most of the guys in here when I say that when a guy is in love, he’ll will do anything for his one and only…as stupid as we may act, as mean as we might seem, if you think we were checking out some waitress at Applebee’s, and our excuse was that we thought she was going trip, so we were just making sure she got into the kitchen safely, we love you unconditionally.  We’ll go out of our way to make you happy, we’ll try to make you laugh, cook your favorite meal, dance to songs we absolutely hate….anything to see that amazing smile, that absolutely infectious laugh, that undeniable beauty.  You could be covered in mud, smell like something an elephant pooped out, and have no teeth for some reason, and you’ll still be beautiful.  You’ll have us in such a grasp, all we can do is listen to love songs, and think about you every second we can.  You’ll put a smile on our face, you’ll make our hearts pump, and our biggest challenges seem like a playschool game, our most difficult hour a little less difficult.  We can be working out, on a Ship, bound to Thailand, with 3 bucks in our wallets, NO way of getting home, and we think some old lady is trying to seduce us, and we’ll most likely think of you….that one person……the one we probably love more than our parents, that one girl, the one that makes us say “I Wish I met her later in life, because I know I want to marry her as soon as possible.”  The one we can be quiet with; the one we can be loud and obnoxious with.  The one we can slow dance with, the one we can break dance with…the one that knows us better than ourselves, the one we know better than ourselves.  The partner in our lives that is so significantly loved, it makes us cry just by acknowledging that fact.  We’ll Love you as long as we know you’ll Love back.  It doesn’t get simpler than that.  And even though a lot of guys don’t feel that way, most of us do, we just wanted to let you ladies know if you didn’t already.      Ok, now, what did I just say? No, really?  Well, if you break it down, you’ll find that one thread went through that entire speech.  And no, it’s not “love”….well, kind of.  Think about what I was saying, all about the relationships and stuff.  What I basically said was that to be in love, someone has to love me back, like, there has to be a 50-50 to share love.  And as much as that makes sense, it’s kind of cutting love short.  As Jesus saw it, We don’t need to be loved to love.  This is where Regular ol’ Lover love, and Christian love Separate Each other. Christian love is different, and may have some getting used to, but when you think about it, if everyone loved the Christian way, this World would kind of be a nicer place.  Jesus said that “It is a deliberate act of the will to love someone regardless of how you feel or how they act toward you.  Jesus taught us to love without any conditions, without any limits, without demanding anything in return.  Now yes, that may be kind of hard to do, especially in this day of age, but when you look at the life of Jesus, you’ll see that love is the least we can do for one another.  He sat and ate with a tax collector.  He showed compassion for the woman about to be stoned for adultery. And perhaps greatest of all; He laid down His life for us and then, to top it off, he forgave those who ridiculed, tortured and killed Him.  I mean, can you imagine? It may be hard for us to grasp such a concept, but, this is how it should be shouldn’t it?  Now, yes, I’m sure your still saying “I want to, but I can’t.” well, yes, it’s hard, and perhaps maybe that’s what the test Jesus left us.  Well, St. Paul knows a thing or two about love too. I have a reading: Love is Patient and kind; it is not jealous or conceited or proud; Love is not ill mannered or selfish or irritable; Love does not keep a record of wrongs; Love is not happy with evil, but is happy with the truth.  Love never gives up; and it’s faith, hope, and patience never fail.          Beautiful isn’t it?  Well, when you put your name in place of the word love, the words themselves take on a bigger meaning.  I’m going to read the passage again with my name replaced for the Word love….while I’m reading, substitute my name for yours….   Steven is Patient and kind; he is not jealous or conceited or proud; Steven is not ill mannered or selfish or irritable; Steven does not keep a record of wrongs; Steven is not happy with evil, but is happy with the truth.  Steven never gives up; and his faith, hope, and patience never fail.  You know, this passage was the first passage I actually liked in the bible.  When we all got our Bibles during the retreat, that was the first thing I turned to, when I went home, I memorized the page number, and highlighted it just to know I had found it, that’s why when I was approached to give this talk, I was very pleasantly surprised.  But when you put your name in, it changes from what love is, to what a Christian should be.  There almost like guidelines one most follow to truly be a good Christian.  Well, when I was reading the “new version” of the passage, something really stood out to me.  The “Steven is Patient and kind” line (yes that did rhyme.  The reason, you might ask, is simple.  I am not usually kind to my family.  My friends, sure, I can be the nicest guy you’ve ever met, but my family is different.  You see, I have 3 other brothers….2 older, and they don’t live with us, and 1 younger, who obviously, still lives with us.  You see, my younger brother has been falling lately in just about every aspect of his life.  He’s grades are poor (that’s a lot better than I can say about mine) and he’s always getting into trouble.  I’m pretty sure he’s been smoking, and probably still does, and I bet he’s gotten drunk before too.  Did I mention he was 13? Well, yes, and with all those things happening in his life, I can’t help but acting very aggressively towards him….not kind at all….and it’s not that I don’t love him, quite the contrary, I love him as much as I love everyone else in my family, it’s just that I can’t respect what he’s doing….sure, I’m sure all of us at some point have done some illicit things, but It’s different when you know your sibling is doing it, and that he/she is pretty young.  Well, because of this, I don’t act kind to him at all, and patience? Forget about it, I think he annoys just about everyone in my immediate family, especially my mom.  You see, my father, a mechanic, knows a thing or two about driving (he’s been doing it since he was about 11), and my little brother knows this, but one day my dad objected to my mothers driving methods, and began to criticize them, this in part made my little brother question everything she does in the car, which is VERY annoying, and when I drive, it’s worst.  This definitely tests my patience, and when I read the “new version” of the passage, it made me realize, I’m a very patient person to everyone else except my family, more specifically my younger Brother, which is kind of ironic, cause I’ll bother him just to see what he’ll do, and that has giving him a lot of patience towards me, and my dad? Same thing, I keep on asking things for my car that he bought, and by now, I’m sure he’s just gotten used to it.  So why Not show the patience I show everyone else?    Well, other than that line, another line caught my eye, “Steven is not ill mannered or selfish or irritable”…now, most of you that know me well enough know I can be VERY ill mannered, these people include rob, Jorge, Mike, Sabby, and Andy, just ask them, I’m sure they’ll come up with something.  Well, yeah, I mean, now that I think about it, I’m those things just about every other day, and to tell you the truth, I don’t think I really like being like that sometimes…I usually act ill mannered when I’m with friends.  Like, I’ll make fake fart noises, or go around doing random things, anywhere I feel like it’ll get a laugh.  And as for irritable? I can get seriously irritable, even if people haven’t seen me.  There’s ton’s of stuff that irritate me, and I know that’s a problem and I really want to fix that.  There are a lot of examples I can give, but I won’t, because that would just irritate me, and that’s what I want to fix.  I seem to be a perfectionist in the game of life, and it just can’t be like that.  It goes back to me having more patience.  And how do I treat my friends? I think pretty darn well.  I mean, I think it’s safe to say that in my close circle of friends, we all feel like brothers.  I mean, I can pull anyone of them, and say what I want, do what I want, think what I want to. And that’s very important to me.  That’s why I always want to go out with my friends, old, and new, that’s why I want to share as much time as I can with them.  Many of my new friends here at Antioch are leaving soon, and I feel that we should all have as much fun as we can before everyone goes.  I think just the thought of that shows the true love I have for friends, that’s why my commitment during the retreat was to “Be More committed to Friends”, I mean, when you think about it, if a person isn’t a family member, their most likely a friend.  And I for one and very thankful that god put me on this earth to meet every single one of my friends, and new friends to come.  I thank him for allowing me the opportunity to share my life with someone else, for giving me people to talk to, to relate to, and to just have fun with.    Well, here I am, last paragraph. So much to say, yet nothing is coming out.   I guess the main idea of this talk is to understand that the Love Jesus Wanted us to share was for a reason, imagine if all of us loved each other the way Jesus said we should, this world would really be an Eden wouldn’t it?  And, I know there’s probably some of you thinking, no one loves the Christian way, it’s just to hard to live in this world like that.” Well, to that I saw, just look around, look at what Christian love brought us.  It brought us each other, and this relaxing atmosphere where we can talk about anything, adults that volunteer there time, and schools that open their door for us…If that isn’t love, I don’t know what is.   so yeah, i mean, the reading went by with out a hitch....what supised me the most though was the reaction to it. I myslef thought it was pretty decent, but nothing to get in a huff about....but alot of people really liked it, i mean, i got some very nice comments said to me, it was just awsome ya know? made ya feel good inside.... :o) but anyway, i thank everyone, and appreciate the fact that everyone liked it like they did...really means alot...But yea...after that, we did the usual closing and everything...O, i should mention there was ALOT less people than normal, which was nuts, cause at that point, rob said that thats how many people used to go! there was like, tops, 16 people there....outa like 30.  But, ya, good shit anyway, still enjoyed it.  Well, since all the ossining people, plus Sara were the only ones who had off this week, no one went to the diner...i ended up coming home, and Talking to Christina, Stephs Freind, online.  After that, i had to go to sleep, cause the next day i had my ROAD TEST! i was pretty exciting, but it turned out to be a very crazy day.     Part 12:  Today  Ok, today started with me waking up pretty early..my lil bro woke me up while he was getting ready....well, anyway, i get dressed, and wait for my ride outside...i get in, and we go to peekskill for some pracitcing....now lemme juss say, i pulled it off, i mean, it wasn;t perfect, but i think i really did worse than i usually do...but anyway, after an hour and a half after that, i finally take it.  I got this guy Pete, real cool old dude, and i do it.....the test took all of 4 minutes....i get back, a changed guy....i can now drive! lol, i know, it's sooo wierd, but ya, i did it! after that, i head home, to go online and find that jones and the rest of us wanted to chill, so, i was all for it...unfortunatly, i had no car to get there with...my mom has the van, and is going to need the van until tonight, and my dads car has a flat...so yeah.  jorge eventually got the car, and gave us all a ride, even though he had to go to a Doctors appointment...thanx Man.  Anyway, we get there, and we basically watch T.V.  I mean, we tryed watching Red Vs. Blue on the plasma, but it was cut short, cause Mr. Jones Got there, and we had to go back downstairs.  But, i mean, thats all we could do..not enough cars, and not enough money.  so we basically just chilled.  Had dinner, then left...pretty streight foward.    Part 13:  The End.... :o) (AKA: The Lucky Number)  Well, yes, as you can read, it has been one HELL of a weekend.....utterly amazing.  Right now, as i type, my dad is coming home from the airport, and i'm juss chillen.  Tomarrow I'm going to the gym with Steph and the guys...and, yeah, i mean this has just  been amazing....never in a million years would i have thought this would happed.  But i don;t regret any of it....um, i still don't know when i'm gonna do my homework and shit, and i missed acouple of things up there, but i mean, ya....To anyone that juss read that whole damn thing,  thank you , by doing this it shows that you care in some way to read it...whether it be cause your bored, want to know my thinking, etc...thanks...well, anyway, i'm gonna get off now...my dad should be coming home real soon, and i'm damn tired....until the next time....

      Ok, lets try this again.....as you can see from two post ago, i got severly pissed that stupid trillian, when i opend a link, opned it through the blogger thing.....i lost soooo much, but here's a quick synopsis so i don;t have to write all of that mumbo jumbo again:  I explained about Benny's Lan party.  Kinda boring, but thats because it wasn't carefully planned out and stuff.  Um, what else.  I explained my whole thoughts about why i wanted to Go to hernie's, lemme explain.  The LAN party, as stated above wasn't going no where.  It was about the 4-5th hour in, and i was getting kinda bored...Jorge signs online, and we tell him to come over to benny's...after several little excuses he told me he thinks hernie wants him to sleep over....at that time, i began to think of what i had to do, and i'm gonna explain it for all those that still don't understand.  I am relitivly new to antioch...i'm  pretty much as new as you can get.  Well, despite that, you become very close with people very fast.  And with this speed, comes care for that person.  Well, you see, the problem with all this is that as cool, and good as these new freinds are, they're all going after this year, which, really sucks.  So, enter Hernie and Jorge.  Appaerntly they had a project going down to show some appreciation.  And no, i'm not gonna tell you what it is....but anyway, they let me in, and since then, we've been wanting to get together to work on it.  BUT, we could never find a time where we were all free....so when jorge told me this, and seeing the current situtation, i thought, "hey, wow, this is a perfect time to practice!"  Well, i told everyone this, thinking they'll say "ok, good, this is getting boring anyway, we might as well leave", and well, that didn't happen.  Jones immediatly objected...and so did the other guys.  And now when i think about it, it would have been selfish of me to leave like that, so  i'm sorry guys...you know how these kinda things go....   Well, anyway, the night ended...well, acutally, it ended inthe morning...around 2 to be exact....well, not much to say there, got home, did the sleep thing, then woke up the next day...and i acutally don;t remember a thing after that....and i'm being totally honest about that.  The only other thing i can remeber was Yesterday, last period.  We didn;t do much, Mr. north wasn't there, so me, and the rest of the class did basically whatever we wanted...the sub was this jaimican lady, so yeah.....anyway, about 10 minutes in, maylene walks up to me....i'm thinking "awsome" right? well, she sits down, and we begin talking...turns out it wasn't for a sexual favor, but for a proposition....she's got this business thing going on at her house, and she wanted to get me in on it....she chose me, cause everyone else was immature, and thought it was a scam...i have my  doubts, but thats not the important thing.....i'm suppose to go to her house on Friday...tomarrow,  BUT  i'm going to box city....a pointless thing where we sleep in boxes for a night to know how it feels liek to be homeless...yes, yes, i know, all that time were spending pretending, we can be acutally doing something, but i think i found out the true purpose of it...to raise money for the midnight run, which is acutally something to help them.  I'm going cause it's just another oppertunity to chill with people.  I have my "talk" on sunday..it's gonna be off the hizzle, fo' shizzle...but yeah, more on that AFTER i read it...And now that i think about it....in my circle of freinds....all of the guys in antioch are moving further away from the guys that aren;t...the most notable is Jones.  And jones know this, but it's only today that i realize it.  And, i'm sorry, it's hard to split time up, but juss know that Jones, and everyone else is still cool in my book, no matter WHAT goes down.    Well, yeah, that brings me to today.  I schooled till 2:30, as usual, and i had to stay after to make up a  math quiz...now, i never did it, and by this time i forgot, so i asked Mr. Fink what it was on, then he was like "secants, and Tangents". then i remmeber what it was about..turns out it was totally different than what i thought...and to top it off, my mom this morning was like, "i'll pick up,but i can;t give rides cause i have to go to college..." well, all that pressure made me give up, adn i ended up answering none of the questions...ya...i was real pissed....i see sabby in the hall, ask him if he saw my mom, and he said no, but immideatly asked for a ride...i said "we'll see" cause i was sure my mom was gonna say no (that is, if she was still there), but, she was there, and i ended up driving....on the this turn, i went over the curb..not cool....but it's only cause i was soo pissed off...Anyway, i get home, eat and shit, and then had an urge to get to the gym...as a joke (well, not really, cause i ALWAYS say it) i ask my mom if i can get the car...and she says yes!! it was sooo awsome!  FINALLY! I get TO DRIVE BY MYSELF!!   So yeah, that went pretty cool, no problems or nothing...came back home in about a hour and a half or so...O, and by the way, to those that are like "thats fucked up, you shoulda have called"...well, here's the thing....it would have been fucked up of me to call, it had No point at all...I couldn't give anyone a ride there, or back, so i'd basically be calling to tell you that i'm going...thats all....so i mean, ya, sorry for any incovience.  But ya.....so now i'm here....typing this out...talking to Steph on the IM, and listening to Music...O!! by the way, if you don;t already have it, get D12 - My Band...that song is soo fucking awsome... But yeah....i'm bored now..... so, i hope this made for some intresting reading....sorry, no juicy secrets to say this time..i got rid of most of them when i started this blog...so...PEACE OUT (yea, i had ALOT more shit to type, like always....but like always...i dun wanna...simple as that...!)

      damn, it's been awhile since a update, but unfortuantly, i can't write alot today.  It's memorial day, and after a long and crazy weekened, i'm just way to tired to describe my thoughts about things.  Looking back at my entry, it's alittle assholish i know, but shit, wtf am i suppose to do, ya know? i don't want to, but i have NOO money right now.  Whatever, knowing me,it'll prolly fade away, but i'm gonna drive alot less now.  o, um....shit, nevermind...if i type it, i'll get eveyone's mouths working.  Oh, btw, i haven't been on AIM for awhile cause i have no com.  The convertion from my case to the one i bought off Czank is taking longer than expected, so for now, i'm not gonna use it.  I mean, it's at the point where i could, but i'm not gonna risk anything....anyway, thats it, ta ta

Thurs is a half a day, and frida and monday we have off...definitly needed before the end of the year.  On thursday i'm suppose to go to Victory with Andy.  It should be intesting...and on friday, were having the Lan party at Czanks house.  Now, the official numbers are foggy, but as of now, i heard 16 people... 16 PEOPLE !! that by far, the biggest i would be going to, and i'm sure it would be for most of the guys too.  i mean, at jonese, the most we had on computers at one time was about 5, or 6, depending.  and i mean, that took ALOT of room, but 16 fucking people!!?!?! thats gonna fucking rock, i don't even care who's coming. And apparently were gonna have like a BBQ too, so thats just the icing on the cake.  The krew is suppose to make an appearance, and thats all i know of.  But i know alot of people have plans.  Like i know Jorge is gonna go to Playland with some people.  Besides, i remeber Dan talking about double dating with jorge judith, him, and a "special" person. lol, unfortunatly, i think i already know who that is, but i could be wrong.  Because of that fact, i ain;t saying names.    i was looking at all the people in the school and realized, i'm gonna miss the seniors.  I mean, i'm not mr. popular, knowing EVERY SINGLE ONE of them, but i mean, i know enough...it's juss soo wierd to picture school with out em'.  But i guess that's how it goes.  If i know them, i'd know enough that i'lll see em' at summer school.  I can't fucking belive i fucked up again..i'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ubeleiveablyy pissed. Fuck that typo.    i'm pretty sure mike was pissed when he heard of my new rule.  It's a buck fifty a ride if u wanna ride to lunch with me.  but after carful consideration, i brought it down to 75 cents.  Don't like it? blow me.  you juss don't seem to recognize my situation.  I don't live a lavish life of 4 bedroom houses, and nice cars.  I live in a SMALL ASS BASEMENT APARTMENT with 2 small ass bedrooms and a bathroom.  thats it.  so off the bat, i don't really have alot of money.  thats number one. number 2, is that i don't pay for my gas.  i don't work, so my parents not only hook me up witht he gas money, but also my lunch moeny. thats 2.  3 is very simple.  My mom juss graduated again from mercy, so she's not working right now.  wanna know why? Cause she has to do feild work before she can start working, therefor he not only has to pay for like almost EVERYTHING, but now, even the rent and shit.  aand to top it off, my car isn;t exaclty the most fule efficient ride around.  ok? so if any of you are wondering, thats it.  75 cents.  Unless i'm going your way.  simple as that.  I need the fucking money.  U think thats stupid? u think that's unfair? u think thats selfish? u think thats not very friendly? read the second sentence of this paragraph....   i'm done...i need to sleep or something.

      lol, i'm so glad to see my post got the bloggers panties in a knot, but let me explain.  I know jones thought about the ex-g/f thing to be directed at him, but in reality,  it was just in general, not just at him.  Sorry by the way about anything.  I just really can't understand it, probably cause i haven;t been in a serious relationship, but i mean, i just can;t stand bitching, (and if you didn't notice already, i bitched) and the more i hear about sheel, or whoever broke up like almost 2, 3 months ago, it's just annoying.  So there's that.  About the problems, basically, i just thought of all the bitching i have ever heard that pissed me off (including my own) and juss went with it.  Basically, i got myself pissed off, and typed alot of shit.  If you notice, after like, the first paragraph, my typing slowly gets worse and worse, this is because i was literally typing SOOO damn fast.  I was pissed....but anyway, iadding to that, those problems i "have", well, they weren't the tell all, be all, they were just examples of some.  Jones defenitly has a more real problem, but like david mentioned, and i too, now mention, we all think about our parents dieing, don't matter who you are.  I used to cry at night, thinking what would happen if my parents died.  This was back in like, 5th grade.  So i;m defnitly no stranger.  ANd i think that's the thing about problems.  When it all boils down, we all got the same shit going on.  But anyway, once again, i appologize, especially to jones, because at the time, i was thinking in general, not specifically.  I was pissed....and as many people can tell you i don't get pissed that often, or that easily, so sorry.  It was just....rush of bad thing = rush of rant.....simple as that.  um, hmmm, what else can i say.....ahhh yes, prom.  Prom is in 2 days for me.  Yea, it's on a wendsday, but that's only cause it's a catholic school...and there not schools...plus, it's like there last day of school TOMARROW, it's fucking nuts...but ANYWAY, i'm still pretty nervous.  I mean, above all else, i just want to get it over with.  All this time thinking of what to do, and juss all that shit is getting to me, i juss wanna get it over with, and that's it.  During the prom, were suppose to go to this boat thing in the city, and apperently Czank already went...told me MAD black people on it.  ya, turned me off to the whole idea right there.  I mean, i'm not racist, thats the last thing i'll be, the reason i feel like this is cause, i garuntee, me and my date are going to be the whitest people there....and i'm not even white....i dunno, i guess it's that whole "outa place" thing.  But hey, whatever, atleast i can live to tell my tale!  Speaking of tail,i still have no car. (?) ya, it sucks, but what that meant was we had to walk to messina's, which was awsome.  Today was one of those days you WANT to walk in.  Rob agreed.  Mike and Ben were going to slow to get into the conversation.  anyway, it's funny, cause today, after school ended, he was STILL looking for a ride.  now, i know you guys no t pisses me off, but i don't think i explained why.  it's just....nevermind, fuck it, no need to get into it. it just pisses me off when people don't even try the hard way, ya know? whatever, no need for that.  I need a new profile pic for this blog.  i look like a fucking communist in a AOL chat or something.  I'm also working on a new BIG PIC for the top.  It's gonna be one of those "krew faces of someone else's bodies" thing.  ya, thats all i seem to use photoshop for.  But whatever, maybe one day i'll need it.    um, damn, reading jones' blog was a real buzz kill! this sucks! i wanted to try and be all funny and shit, but i can't! When you write a entry like that, you hope you don't piss anyone else off, but when u do, it sucks!  no matter, i appologized anyway, and that's the end of that.  I didn't even know he felt that! Jone! you should have said something in school! we could have cleared that up in like 3 seconds! that's the problems.  Were all living double lives now.  One, is our regular, good ol' lives, the next is our free speech terminal known as our blogs.  As therepuetic it is, it s better when we acutally discuss the topics in the entrues i think.  i just clears things up further.  kind of like talking with J.R.R. Toilken after reading the LOTR trilogy,  You just end up getting so much more out of it.  Cause i know FOR A FACT i never type out everything that happened, or has to do with a certain topic i'm writing about. So i encourage whoever reads MY blog atleast, to confront me, if i offended you, please tell me, cause more times that not, i didn't mean it.   I got that game Mafia, and thanx to jones, a copy of Hitman 2.  Good games, keeping me busy.  Still have to do english though, and Earth Science, in which i have to IM Shawna about...SHIT! i should do that!  .............................................................  Away message.....perhaps later..   I NEED GYM!!!  I haven;t been to the gym awhile.  And no, i'm not trying to say, i'ma "big", "buff" guy that lives in the gym.  I juist live in the gym, literally.  I love it there.  You get out whatever you have there, really, plus u gain muscle in the process, boosting your personality in the process.    I shaved my chest hair to low.  I was aiming for a minor trim, but on the first go around, i used a size WAY to small, and ended up having to "finish" the job on the rest of my xhest, or else it would have look Retarded.  I didn't shave, that would be kinda wierd, but i just trimmed it to low....close to shave, but not quite.  I need a new screen name 2.  I have this same one for like, 6,7 years now, and it's getting kind of annoying.  No really, it is.  I don't talk to alot of people on my Buddylist anyway, i almost neevr initiate a convo, so i could pull it off.  If you got some sugestions or something, drop the email at Syco10562@hotmail.com (errr...) or leave a comment.    I think i should get a new lisence plate number...as amusing as it may be, i think it comes off kinda gay, and i'm definitly not gay.  I'll think of a new one...  Ok, thats enough for now, got some shit out, did the blog thing, and thats about it.....bye bye bye by eby ebye bybeyebrfefe (......)

      ya....i don't really have alot to say...i've lost my blogging instinct...could it be the end? could the blogocaust prophecy hold merit?   probably not, but i have been ina  dry spell lately....i just don't feel like typing about shit.  I dunno what it is....hmmmm   Hope you people like the picture at the top.  I didn't make it, so don't yell at me if you don't like it.  Leave a comment though!  anyway, i breifly copied and pasted the links code from my old template on to this new one, but it came out retarded....*HmpH*, i mean "Mentally Ill"...ok, fuck it, it basically came out fucked up, so i prolly won't try it again, unless i figure out HTML 2.0 or whatever the code is.  Hope you guys like the new title to.  THe old one lost all novelty it ever had, and just got to annoying to look at.  Kinda  like hearing the same joke over and over again.  yup....  you know what i hate? i hate when people think they got it bad.  Like, i hate when people think there "depressed", and  have alot of problems, and they make people think there gonna commit suicide.  Shit, you people wanna hear problems, you come talk to me.  I have MANY problems, that won't even touch upon anything ANYONE has trust.  Just on two little peices of info i know, i automatically hold more problems.  If i realease one, it changes my life forever (it sounds ridiculous, but you really have NO idea)...and one, not so big, can really mess up something my freind has.  Thats NOT to mention school...which i havent done good at at all this year, which limits my chance to get into a good college, my car being fucked up, loosing my wallet, which contains my lisence, which stops me from driving, PLUS my brother and sister-in-law crashing at my house, rendering it a complete and total mess, my DCA, which, if dosn't get appealed, meant that i went through that whole class for nothing, PLUS just the fact that i don't have alot of money....shit, let's break that down....moeny...."boo, hoo, i have problems, i have this, i have that.." holy mother fucking shit...QUIT ALL YOUR BITCHING. you know what sets me appart? i DON'T HAVE A HOUSE....i live in a fucking basement appartment....ok, so while your living in your 3+ room house, i'm stuck in a mother fucking basement.  I should be so lucky to even say i have a car, and digital cable, and DSL, i really should.  I don't take anythign for granted like most people do, i fucking appreciate how i got my shit, i don't just use it, and cry about it when i don't have it anymore.  thats why when i play music, i don't just go online, and read off digital paper, thats why i don't ask someone how to do something, i try and figure it out, try to appreciate it, and put my own self into it, that's why i never try and show off, thats why i hate making fun oof people, thats why i hate when people think there better than someone else, and don;t even have the common curtecy of showing some fucking respect.   Then people go on about there problems, tried and true to the blogging way of life.  lemme just write down all my problems, and there we go...it's not like that for me...it would be impossible to show you all the problems i have ever had.  Even now.  Your problems are a break up, no g/f, no job, all that shit, mine is that shit x2.  fuck, i'm gonna go more specific on that "life or death" info just so whoever is reading this has an idea.  What i know, can cause my parents to get a divorce.  I'm not just saying that cause thats what i think...i'm saying it cause thats what i know.  it almost happened once for the same reason,  and i know if i tell anyone this, it's over.  Can you understand what thats likes?  who do you follow; what do you do?  Whats the right thing to do here? should i keep it to myself, and pretend like it never happened, and just let it keep on eating me like a fat kid eats a cake, or should i do the  "right thing" tell "someone" and let a marrige, a family, go to nothing?  holy fuck! i just really can;t imagine the shit people say, when they have problems.  They don't have problems, they just don't appreciate, they see things in a different light, a dimmer light, which dosn't let them see the true shape and form of things.  "aww, i don't have a g/f, i think i'm gonna go cry now"...that was my attitude, but, for what? crying don;t get you know where.  "aww man, i just broke up with someone.." so what? i'm sure it's tuff, but why look at the negatives? now you know what not to do, and create a better and more fruitful relationship for next time.  People this day of age don't appreciate shit.  They take everything for granted.  They think they got it sooooo bad, but they never really sit back and have a look at where there thinking about it.  Your house, your amazingly big house....i've NEVER owned a home, let alone live in one.  The closest i  ever got was that big as apartment i was so fortunate to live in for a couple of months.  thats it....all my ife has been is appartments, no more, no less.  I could never call a place a home.  I've moved more  times that a human blinks.  but you know what? that builds character, it makes you a person, not just a follower.  Not just someone who thinks highly of themselves.  i don't go around saying a play the guitar, i don't go around proclaiming my poems as works of art, i don't do any of that.  myabe i should...maybe i should go around proclaiming the fact that i "taught  myself" the guitar....maybe people will be impress? maybe everytime i jam with someone, i'm gonna go play the latest flavor of guitar i know, infront of you, and make it seem like i'm better than you.  Maybe i should act way more mature than i am, and not have any fun at all, never let go, always thinking i'm an adult.  Maybe i should always order the same thing at a resturant, never get anything different, claim i'm open-minded, and say it to your face, maybe i should make fun of you, blaintently, poitn out everything that pisses me off, just dismantle you with words, but never tell you, and still call you my best freind.  Maybe i should try and help you, get you to go in the gym, but you still won't come.  Maybe i should tell you about everything on my mind, and you still don't know what i'm saying.  Maybe i should say thanks for being a freind all these years.  Maybe i should just stop.  Maybe i shouldn't.    I like what jorge and hernie have.  I like what me and andy have, i like what rob and healey have, i like what jones and me, and mike, and the fucking rest of us have.  Freindship is good, but it's only a freindship if you don't talk behind peoples back. I HATE when people don't appreciate shit.  Like rob.  Apparently, the way he acts, it's almost like he expects a ride from me everyday for lunch.  Like, he KNOWS im gonna give him a ride, and if i don't,  he gets pissed.  If i don't give him a ride home, cause his mommy can't pick him up, he gets pissed.  Shit people, fucking gas is expensive as fuck, you should be so fucking lucky as to even fucking SAY you have a ride.  I like giving people rides ok, just not everyday.  Especially when people need to fucking walk.  i absolutly hate it.  they get in my car, slam MY fucking doors, and pretend that it's suppose to be like that.  Well, when i get my car back, no more rides.  It's only gonna be when i fucking decide it's gonna be.  It's not that i'm mean, ti's not that i'm being selfish, it's that i'm being real.  No body seems to thank my, honestly, no one really apriciate, they expect, and thats juss fucking rude.  On monday i'm gonna need a ride...might get one, might not, but atleast when i get one i make sure to say "thanx alot so and so,  really aprciate it", and not try and say it like i didn;'t mean it.  i do mean it, i understand the everything involved in taking me home. shit people, we gotta fucking change...   i'm tired of ranting, i'll rant some other time...

I'm kinda nervous, but more just eager to get it over with, so i can finally stop worrying about it.    School was boring as usual....since theres like 3-4 weeks left of school, everyone is doing NOTHING.....i'm gonna miss the seniors though, they were a hell-of-a-class.  ya.... Um, what else...shit, can';t think of anything.  talked to czank, we sehdualed (a know thats wrong) a LAN party at his house the 28th....he'll keep me posted though.    O yah, today is senior prom, mad seniors, and others are going to prom......crazy....  my car is breaking down, and i can;t stop it...  god damn, this is my 50th post, and this turned out to be the shittiest one...go figure?

      Ya, yet again i find something, and yet again i'm not taking credit for it....just backing it up...the link is  urlLink here      The internet is shit.  It is vitally important that we all realize this and move on. People (eg Bloggers) go on and on about how wonderful it is. About how much information is out there in cyberspace. About the way that everything is within reach in just a few clicks of their mice.  For instance:  "If I can operate Google, I can find anything... Google, combined with Wi-Fi, is a little bit like God. God is wireless, God is everywhere and God sees and knows everything. Throughout history, people connected to God without wires. Now, for many questions in the world, you ask Google, and increasingly, you can do it without wires, too."  Alan Cohen, V.P. of Airespace, a new Wi-Fi provider, New York Times, 6/29/03  I can name 20 people from my old school class who aren't in Google. I can walk into any public library, no matter how tiny and underfunded, and find facts, stories, amazing information I would never touch in a month of webcrawling. I can go into a bar and hear stories Usenet hasn't come close to in its 22 years of waffle. "Oh but what about the stuff you CAN get on the web?" the netheads say. But they're missing the point.  The internet is not the sole basis upon which you can determine existence. It sounds simple but people are starting to forget. If it doesn't have a website, that doesn't make something low quality. If you can't Google your blind date, that doesn't make them a freak. If one website says something about anything, it's more than likely pure invention and shouldn't be taken seriously. Checking your sources does not mean finding another website that says the same. Fiction is self-perpetuating.  Let's say it another way. A URL is not a mark of quality. It's not proof of honesty or approval from the FDA. Sure, people say they know this already, that a lot of the internet isn't true and a lot of it isn't interesting, no matter how angst-ridden and attention-seeking its author. But still we praise the internet for everything, from mobilising global protests to creating the latest trends, while disappearing up its backside and discarding anything outside it as 'out of touch'.  While we ascribe every first-world miracle to the electronic age, there's something truly missing that we once had in our grasp: our sense of wonder. Back in 1995, we were surprised, agog when things appeared on the net. People starting going around saying 'wow, this could really become something'. Slowly (very slowly at 16kbps), strange websites, new information, odd diversions and discussions with people around the world appeared in this brave new world. Each time it was met with surprise and delight, even if some of it was deeply obscure and slightly dull. There was no doubting the potential of the medium.  And look what we've done with it. Food wrappers and soap operas now tell us to visit their websites. Money is pumped online by people who can't even spell HTML. All manner of pointless and irritating content is continually poured down the infinite hole of data, unfiltered and over-appreciated. In accepting freedom of speech, we can't hide from its consequences - which in this case is millions of terabytes of unreliable information, badly designed and clumsily written. We have failed our own creation and given birth something truly awful. We're just too busy cooing over the pram to notice.  We need to start again. We need to stop saying how wonderful things are. We need to openly, truthfully and respectfully admit that the internet itself, in almost all of what's been done with it, is shit.  There's no point in undoing what has been done. What we need to do is to change our attitude. The internet isn't new any more. The evangelists have done their job. Everyone's heard of it even if they don't spend their lives logged on. Now its the job of the congregation to revolt. Chant it from the rooftops, spread it across your server, email it to your friends. The internet is shit.  And then what? Then we can move on. If we truly understand that the internet is shit then maybe we'll go back to looking elsewhere to check our information instead of just Google. Maybe journalists will do proper research again. If we remember that the medium isn't the message then maybe we'll stop aimlessly surfing for something amusing when we could actually be doing something fun. And, crucially, if the internet is just seen as occasionally unavoidable, maybe those websites that give us something special will be all the more amazing for it.  Give an infinite number of monkeys typewriters and they'll produce the works of Shakespeare. Unfortunately, I feel like I'm reading all the books where they didn't. I can't wait for the day when the internet makes me rejoice in its possibilities again. But right now, it's shit.

       	 Once in a while, you see shit online that makes u smile......that's all i wanna say....read below,  the link to it is  urlLink Here .  I in no way, sahpe, or form, take credit for this entry, all i do is keep a "back-up" incase the other site goes down for some reason.         The Seven Deadly Sins 	 	  Hello, new people! There are quite a lot of you, so greetings and salutations. Don't be strangers.  I have been making huge, thoughtful entries lately. So, today, as per scathedobsidian 's suggestion, I present you with the fun instead of the cerebral. I give you:  The Seven Sins of Blogging     1. Thou shalt not post quiz results.  No one cares. It takes precious time to load those images and there are only about 1.5 souls in all of Livejournal that give a crap that you are a pervy Ewok fancier. If you must post quiz results, stick with the small image/short blurb ones and put them behind cuts. The long answers inevitably paired with drawings that look like they were done by a 14 year old who mainlines glitter like heroine and masturbates to Lady Cottington's Pocket Pressed Fairy Book, the answers which masquerade as content, are punishable by a week in the stocks. We all take them. But don't inflict them on others, public torture is against the Geneva Convention. It's nice that your true heart is made of crystal. Mine is made of angry, angry iron smelted by large Russians who still believe in the Workers' Revolution. We will crush you.      2. Thou shalt not mangle the English language.  OMG! LoTR iS teH sHIznIT! I hereby declare holy crusade against you and will shortly arrive at your door eager to get Byzantine on your ass. English is a beautiful language, spoken by kings and poets, pioneers and monks. Do not treat it like a cheap slut you can impregnate with your mewling bastards. Capitalize only proper nouns and the first letters of sentences. Discover the spell check option. Control your instinct toward acronyms. The words are "boy" and "girl." Ever is not spelled with an A. T and H are very good friends. They want to stay together always, and make mad consonant love whenever they can. Do not insert E, the nefarious vowel, into their pure and holy love--it belongs at the end. If you are, in fact, 12 years of age, try to cover this fact by writing in a way which does not make anyone older than you cram a barbecue fork into their skull and scramble their eyeballs like Sunday eggs. Expressions of fannish joy placed within asterisks (*squee*) are a subset of this sin, and only acceptable when used in moderation--but when coupled with a hot pink layout and icons featuring Legolas, incure the sentence of death by pressing.     3. Thou shalt not post IM conversations.  No one cares. Remember when you last smoked pot/got drunk, and you thought you were saying some really amazingly deep things, plumbing the depths of universal truths with a sense of wit and humor to which Falstaff himself would doff his cap? Yeah, you didn't. You told your mom's book club buddy that her legs were the word, and she should spread the word, then vomited all over her turquoise Kathie Lee Collection pantsuit. Your IM conversatons are only interesting to you and the other person involved. We do not know you all that well, much less do we know who CraKHed756 is, and why you would feel the need to discuss the ramifications of the current socio-political situation on ferrets. IM conversations are private. Keep them that way, for the love of god. If there is any erotic content to said conversation, this is an especially apt warning. Do not forget the Angry Russians.     4. Thou shalt not post large pictures of thyself or others without using Ye Holy LJ-Cut.  Yea verily, a whole group of sins involve not indulging in the magnanimous LJ-Cut (or equivalent linking technique, for non-LJ blogs) when it desperately calls out for use. Large pictures of your vacation, your mug, your dog, your mom, the turquoise pantsuit, your boss schtupping the security guard in the Comedy/Family section of Blockbuster, your house, your goiter, George Bush in amusing poses, or any other image larger than a gaggle of icons have no place outside of the LJ-cut fence. Not everyone has delicious and nutritious Japanese broadband access like I do. They take precious time to load, time which brings us all closer to death. Multiple pictures only compound your sin in the eyes of the Almighty Server.  5. Thou shalt not under any circumstances, post poetry without a cut.  Particularly if you are the sort of manic little howler monkey that feels the need to cross-post a poem to several communities, for the love of all that is good, please LJ-cut your six-part epic on angst, death, tears, self-cutting, and how black is the dawn when Daddy won't buy you an iPod. Even if your poetry is good, it angers the reader to have to scroll through it a dozen times. Poetry is longer than prose, because it's in a column. It takes up huge amounts of room if it's posted once. And I, humble reader, will let you in on a secret. 95% of readers scroll right on by the second they see a column. You will get less comments on a poem than on the Ewok fancier quiz, even if the poem is brilliant. A blank entry will get you more comments. So posting it in full does nothing but annoy. It does not force people to read your Slytherin limerick fest. Cross-posting will only make anyone who might have told you what you wanted to hear stab their screen repeatedly. An LJ-cut will make you appear considerate and mature, which will entice a few to read your opus. A few is about the best you will get. Embrace cuts. Cuts are your friends. You don't want to hurt your friends, do you?     6. Thou shalt not get creative with font colors.  This makes me feel like I ate bad mushrooms at a chili-cook off hosted by Pennywise the Clown. If it sparkles, dances, or magically changes color in mid-sentence, I will find you and break off your hands at the wrists to use as lawn ornaments at Christmastide. The human eye can only take so much before it spontaneously liquefies. If I feel an epileptic fit coming on and my golden retriever runs for the leather bit to keep me from biting off my own tongue as I jerk and gibber in the magenta light of your neon words, you will find yourself beset by karmic locusts within the week. If the subject matter of your Rainbow-Brite text involves boys, the unfairness of your parents, or Orlando Bloom, they will be joined by biting red ants. You're not making your site more visually interesting, you're making yourself appear color blind and/or severely retarded.     7. Thou shalt not act like an ass.  You are not the next Napoleon. Just because you have 150 friends-of does not mean you are well on your way to world domination and cultural saturation. Your personal turns-of-phrase are not on the brink of common use on MTV. You are not going to grow up to create Plato's Republic on an island in the sea. You are not Joe Cool. You are not the lord anyone's god. You are a very small person with sweaty hands and a prescription for Paxil clutched in your prehensile toes. Neither are you Edgar Allen Poe or Tom Paine, William Butler Yeats or Jack Kerouac. Your goth statements of Dark Glory and Destruction, Political Commentary for Those Who Already Agree, Epic Poetry on the Subject of Your Bitch-Monster Ex, and Edgy Sex Adventures just make you a slightly frog-like creature who spends too much time online, not the next Great Man. Telling others of your majesty will not help. Standing up in your blog and shaking your Kong-like fists at the virtual sky while hollering I AM KIROK!  at the top of your cyber-voice might scare a few wandering Google robots into your burgeoning fold, but the rest of us will yawn and belch in your general direction. Blessed are those with perspective.  We've all done most of them, at some point or another, to some degree or another. Sinning is the Official Past-time of Humanity. Thusly, I say unto you, O Pilgrims, have ye never sinned?

      ya...ummmm........i've been asleep since about 4.....it's like 9 o'clock right now.......ya.....and i'm STILL tired.....  ok, now that i got THAT across, let me explain why that's bad.  I have an AP test in 2 days...the second hardest test offered....what is the test you ask? AP U.S History....aww yes....guess what sleeping prevented me to do? yes, yes, yes, that's right...STUDY.  I'm not angry though, just disapointed that i couldn't get more done today.   I wanted to go to the gym, study, waste time..you know, the usual...SPEAKING OF THE GYM..  Let me just say something.  Like, last year, i thought i "worked out".  I had some wieghts in my room and shit, and occasionally i "worked" out my muscle's.  If anything, i did get SOMETHING out of it, but i think my ego was the thing getting worked out the most.  Then Andy started his quest for S.E.A.L> perfection.  I went along on the magic carpet ride, but not fully.  And even though i'm not really at the level he is, it's god damn crazy to think where i started.  I look in the mirror, and, i don't know, it's so rewarded.  It's like having a baby.  You see, when people start working out (this DEFINITLY included me) they don't really know what to do.  I for one, knew acouple of things, but not as much as i do now.  Lemme just say this people.   You have to want it to get it.   When i started out, sure i was intimidated, thats what usually keeps people away from the gym.  That kept me away for awhile.  But, as funny and retarted as this sounds, i decided to get Fitness made simple......now, at first, this seemed like a bad buy, like, all it is is him doing is workout's at the gym.  But, you then realize the point of this video.  It TELLS you all the workouts, how to do them correctly, what your suppose to feel.  That definitly got me in the gym.  I got in there, acutally KNOWING more than like 2 excercises.  Anyway, after that, i started  and couldn't stop.  O, byu the way, another problem people have is not rechognizing good pain from bad when they first start working out.   I learned the hard way, but u can always ask someone.  Anyway, ya.  As i look in the mirror, i almost want to cry....No, i'm not being self-centered, i'm just fucking glad i started to work out.  It gives you a whole new reason to live.  You become more out going, you wear tighter close, ya know, try to get noticed more, it's just a whole body transformation.  What tops it is the fact that you r own sweat made it possible. I'm not saying i'm the most jacked person alive, i'm just saying i've made huge leaps and bounds to wear i was at.  Like, my MAX bench press back then was like 150....it's like 210 now (well, last time i did it it was 190, but i did three of those, so i'm guestimating).  I mean, lol, i know this is weird, but it really is incredible.  Anyway, i urge any of you if your reading thisto atleast try it out.  Whatever you feel, just know, EVERYONE at the gym as felt that before.  Pretty much no one is gonna make fun of ya, and if they do, you got MAD people backing you up, so don't even sweat that.  Just get in there, and FUCKING WORK IT!  ...ya, sorry about that, i had to share...I've noticed i started a song below this entry...The Flower....lol, ya.  THe song was inspired by Jorge mainly.  Lemme just start off by saying,  since i've known jorge, which prolly goes back to about 6th grade...he's been catching shit.  Like, not just anyshit, the think, stinky, hard shit.  And  nobody  should catch shit of any sort to begin with.  Anway, for some reason, i just felt like wrting a semi-inspirational song.   I think this was after i read His blog.  Just a whole bucnha old feelings came back and shit, so yeah, i thought i owed em' one.  Didn't finish it yet, but i will. On the subjects of freinds, lemme just say people, thanks for sticking around.  Our lives would be severly different if we didn;t know about it.  I mean, i'll give you aexample of a KEY freind to us all, Rob.  Imagine is we didn't know rob.  I'm sure alot of people don't realize this, but he's been there through ALOT.  Jorge introduced me to rob by the way.  But i mean, just think about it.  We would have prolly NEVER heard about antioch.  Jorge and andy would probably have NEVER met there g/f's, we would have never made all these new frinds, i wouldn't have gone to prom, and just a countless amount of other things.  I don't know what you guys can say for me, i doubt i've really been as importnat as some others, but still, life would be different.  We each bring our own style to the table.  We represent everything in society.  We are the Ying to each others yang. i think it's safe to say we complete each other.  It might come across gay, but shit man, i think it's safe to say we love each other.  We may not admit it, but come on, it's a great freindship we all share.  Agree with me, or not, no difference, this is just coming from me though.  I guess the main idea of the paragraph is to say, that we should all try to keep it this way, we should stop the gossip, stop the critisism, and just try tosaty cool.  I mean, think about it, we only have about a year left together before everyone goes and starts a new life in college! ONE MORE YEAR....i never though i'd be saying that....i'm sure it's worst for the seniors.  But ya, come on people, let's make this a year to remeber!  i ran out of shit to say.  My day...ehh....just over average, and my love life? still non existent......what a wonderful world :o)

      whats up people....finally updating.  Um, hmmm, where should i start....um, i juss came back from school, after my APE test today...things went pretty smoothly, just glad it's finally over.  um....hmmm, shit, lol, i can;t think of anything to write!  Um, well, after test, we went down to go eat some burgers down at wendy's and stuff.  I told the guys that usually go to luch with me that i could drive them there, but not bring them back.  I think rob of all people got mad, and i think the others were kinda dissapointed.  But they gotta realize i can;t be driving them everywhere.  Know yes, i know rob's parents always gave us, paticualrly me a ride when i needed it, and i'm very thankful for that, BUT, i'm not paying for my own gas, for my own car, and i acutally apprciate the way my family makes there living, so i'm not fucking gonna go everywhere dropping people off.  I'll only do it when were car pooling, and sometimes not even then.   ok, now that that's off my back....um, yea, everyone seems to be together these days. Maybe it's cause it's spring, but i don't know.  So far, i've stated that MAD random shit is happening, and that still holds true.  Andy found someone, which is awsome, and jorge is still with Judith.  Um....fuck, forget about it, i ran out of a list of names....but ya know whats funny?  As random as this appearce to me, i'm sure my freinds are gonna say the same thing to me.  The last time they saw me go out with someone was in 9th grade!  9TH GRADE!! , so yeah.  Um.....what else.  Ya, whatever, i'm not even sweating it anymore.  Like, i belive there someone for someone else, like, there ALWAYS that "perfect" match for someone esle.  Dosn't mean your gonna meet em, but they do exist...so ya, thats my excuse.  Like, acouple of weeks ago i was talking to steph, and during that convo, i realized my problem.  I don't go after anyone i like.  Like , i try, but definitly not like i should.  But it's hard.  Like, Andy, i know, worked to get with his girl.  Like, he even told me, he;s commited and shit.  And look at them now! like, for me, i just expect everything to happen the way it did in 9th grade...cause like, that way was fucking awsome.  But now that i realize it, i got there cause i worked to get to that level in a relationship.  I dunno, i juss gotta get out there, and meet new people.  I'm not gonna try out my new tactic at antioch cause frankly, i don't really like the girls there. (no offense by the way).  They prolly don't like me either, but hey, what am i gonna do, right?  Well, ya, i'll prolly try becoming better freinds WITH the people at antioch, and maybe they can introduce me to some of their freinds or something.  And only 2 people i would even think about having a relationship at antioch is michelle, ane possibly mary...but not even, ya know? (to anyone who isn't in antioch, sorry)  SPEAKING of antioch, i read jones' blog, and even though he said i don't have to, i'll say it anyway, sorry man,  This is how it went down.   That day was SAT's, and yes, jones' DID remind me.  BUT, the d&d game was at night, so i was MADD bored, and needed something to do. Saw jorge was online, asked him if he was free.  He was, and we decided we were gonna jam (i do play guitar ya know..), but we needed a place to do it.  Well, hernie is are go to guy in those situations, so we called him.  he said it was cool, i packed all my shit up, and headed over.  When i got there, turns out it wasn't just gonna be us three.  It was me, jorge, dorian, that kid julian that lives next door to dorian, Jaquan (not ninja turtle), and like always, Hernie's little brother was chillen too.  So we played Gamecube for a while, and that lasted, like....had to be 2-3 hours.  Well, by that time, me and jorge went down stairs, cause we wanted to jam.  We played alittle bit, but then benny called.  I then remebered about d and d! i was like, o shit.  So we tell him whats up and we said well call him back.  By that time, jorge's parents were like "let's go mini-golfing" so we were gonna go there, but i totally forgot.  Well, anyway, i still really wanted to play guitar..but D&D was in the back of my head.  By this time, i think it was hernie's uncle(?) that called, to have us over to eat some BBQ...well, i definitly didn't want to go to that, not cause i don't like them, but, i don't know, i guess i was juss tired of being there, so i decided to bounce.  I told them to call me when they were leaving for golfing.  Well, i went back home, and pretty much stayed there for the rest of the night.  I didn't wanna call up the guys at d and d, cause first of all, i had NO idea where they were, and second, i was..i dunno, the only way i could describe it was....depressed? like, not emotionally, but phsyically, i just didn;t want to move.  And, ya, i didn't go to golfing for that same reason....+ i had no money.  So there ya go, thats the story of that  Antioch yesterday was less-than average.  I mean, people  showed up, and it was cool, but sometimes you juss gotta have certain people to srpuce things up.  Rob, Scott, Michelle, Andy, (well, he was there, but not "THERE"), Mike....etc etc.  It was ok none the less.  Vinny gave a talk about Past, present and future and shit, and thats about it.  That reminded though of my first talk, the one about love...ya, everyone saying how good it was and shit was really cool......memories......ya, i guess another thing to mention  about antioch was me trying to sing.  The girls on the other side of the circle were singing "lean On Me", and i jumped in, and we were  all singing it, mad cool....and even though i sounded bad, i still had fun   Um, shit, what else, what else....o yeah, SAT's...i think i did decent, hopefully better than the PSAT's..(like 780...:o()  I fucked up on my section 5 though.  Like, it was a buncha problems i knew i could do, but since i was taking the long was, cause it was the only way i remember, i was taking way to long, and  next thing i knew, time was up, and i had like 12 blank! i was like, o shit! so i guessed about 5, and left the others fre...i dun think it was twelve, maybe it was like, 10, but w/e....i hope i did good.    Omg, lemme juss say one thing....some people can;t get over shit.  lemme explain...I, like most people when there bored on aim, scavange the names on the list, and view other's Away messages.  If they have AIM, and a profile, you can see those too....now, i did such a thing, when i stumbled on sheel's...turns out she has a blog....enough said.  I'm a bore guy....so i want to get entertained, but this shit is SICK.  Now, like, i understand she had feelings for him and what not, thats very understandable, but holy shit!  she's gotta except the fact that it's over.  there's ALOT more fish in the sea, ALOT ALOT ALOT more.....i think she has the same problem i do, she doesn't TRY.....but ya, no offense to sheel or whoever knows her thats reading this.  I'm not calling her a mental case, i'm juss saying shit like that is unhealty, she's juss gotta move on.  And whats this shit about dan only wanted her to fuck?? thats some mother fucking  BULLSHIT .  Now...shit, i can't talk for dan, i don't know what his intentions were, but from what i know, i think i can say, that when u go out with a person for MORE than a year, it's expected that you too have atleast had sex one.  And no, i'm not saying thats the rule, i'm saying thats what usually happens WHEN YOUR TOGETHER THAT LONG.  IT TENDS TO HAPPEN.  If dan did try to get you to do it, you know what that means? That means he prolly likes you ALOT, no, no, wait, scratch that,  LOVES  you alot.  And whats a synnonym of Fucking, sex, Horizontal tango?   MAKING LOVE .  I mean, sheesh.  And then you start rying and shit, PLEASE. Actions speak louder than words.  By saying no, i mean, shit, it's like, you don't want him to share the love he has for you, with you.  Now, if your scared of penis' that a different story, BUT COME ON NOW....ok, enough ranting about that....i juss had to get that shit out, ya know? If your reading this, sheel, there ya go, u got my side of things.  Still gotta get my tux for prom....T minus 17 days left....i'm excited! can;t wait to see what happens!!  hopefully i get a nice tux, but well see   ok...thats about it, i got nothing left.....i'm definitly gonna head to the gym today, and then prolly sleep.....i MIGHT update this shit, but most likely not....

      i haven't really gave a good, overall  entry in a while.  Well, of course, thats what i'm going to try to fulfill with this one.  I guess the most important piece of information i can give right now is that i got my DCA (denied Credit due to Absents) overturned....want a story? you've come to the right place.... :o )   back during third quarter, i finally begin to drive.  Problem is,  with great power comes great responsibility , (yeah, stop laughing, i know where thats from) which basically means, i woke up late like EVERY day.  Now, this wasn't a big deal, Jesse was late more than a slut, so i figured it wasn't gonna really be a problem.  Acouple of weeks later, My AP English (thats the class I DCA'd due to tardies...it's 1st period) teacher informs me that i DCA'd that quarter.  So i was like " WTF??!?!? ", but anyway, i go down to the attendance office, and turns out all those absence's, which i got notes for, counted towards DCA...those smart bastards. anyway, my mom (thank GOD for her) went in and cleared them ALL up...one problem, the DCA still stands until i get it overturned, IF THAT.  So fast foward to yesterday, i try and get my papers in order and shit, and Mr. Watson tells me that he's gonna try and stick me in today for an appointment....i end up waking up REALLY early (whats new...) and i get there late...cause i could....(muahahahh) but ya, they're were people there waitng. but apparently i was the first of the bunch, even though i was the last to get there (it rocked hard man..), but ya, i go into the main office, and sit down at this table that kinda looked like a stone tablets the Inca's would use to sacrafice Virgins or something (no WONDER i was there!!!!) anyway, i "state my case", or as i like to call it, "lower my pride meter" and give some bogus ass excuse about my car breaking down...now, i know my car is kinda bad, or atleast the engine is VERY high milage, BUT, the was i made it sounds was HORRIBLE!! the greatest part of it all....she BOUGHT IT!!! i mean, she gave me a diet speech about how that wouldn't work in the real world and shit, and i was like "yup, yup, yup" and she let me go...was what was awsome is, she ask if i got my gown and the sqaure thing already (forgot what it's called) and i was like "o, i'm no a snior"...we walk out (mr. watson, my guidance counceler, and me) and they were telling me how amazingly lucky i was cause she usually dosn't overturn shit like that for underclassmen...and i was just ALL smilez...now there are sveral theories i came up with as to the success of my overturn:  1. Because she thought i was a senior, she let me slide  2. She felt real bad cause i was the first one, and it was so early  3. she's acutally a nice person  4. She thought i had alot of balls to give her such a bogus ass excuse  5. she was inpressed with the letter  6. She thought i was uber hawt (needed a filler!)   so there ya have it, that was my day in the morning....i spent the rest here, listening to music and shit, the usual.  I was looking at all the complete CD's i have ripped on my Computer, and like, Now 2 was there, and there's that song "Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen) (Edit)" by Baz Luhrmann.....omg, let me say, that song is awsome...... AWSOME!!!! ...i remmeber loving this back when i first got the cd, but i re-discovered it....and now, i wanna base my life after this guy...           ya, ummmm, what else.....o yeah, i'm going to Florida on Saturday....i'm very excited, cause everytime i go to FLorida, i'm older, and wiser, and the whole time becomes better...ya.  But i still got today and tomarrow.  Today i wanna go out, and have a "guys night out" for jorge.  Don't know why? to bad..cause i ain't saying it. But i think he needs one, and i think we juss all gotta chill. I think it just hit everyone that this like the last summer together for alot of people, so gotta make it count. I might not make it though, cause i MIGHT have to go to the mall, and buy last minute shit for florida, but if dosn't, i hope the guys take him out anyway, i think he needs it.    Tomarrow is promising to be a HELL of a day...But i'm not putting to much stock in it....In the afternoon, i got the re-taping of  Martosis  and that night, A BUNCH of us are suppose to go to the movies...here's the gang so far:  Me (nooo!?!?), jones, rob, jorge, mike, scott, jenn, Caroline, farah, lilia, ummmmm Possibly Sabby, and whoever he brings  so yeah, good sized group...were suppose to go see  urlLink Dodgeball: A true Underdog Story , so hopefully it'll be worth it.  And i know waht your thinking...one phrase can say it all.....OoOooooooOOoOOO!!!! lol, ya, i know i like Lilia, it's no secret, i'm not embarassed or anything, but whats funny is, i found this thing about Libras (thats what i am), and it describe ON THE DOT the problem i have with trying to go out with someone....i'll put the whole thing in,  urlLink Here's  the Link to it.    When it comes right down to taking action, however your indecisiveness often takes over. You start to weigh the pros and cons and if you have any doubts at all you will continue to play with your victims' desires. You don't really like to hurt anyone intentionally which does end up putting you at the mercy of your lover.    that shit hit me like a ton of bricks...cause it's true, thats what happens, lol, like, i was like HOLY SHIT...THAT IS SOOO TRUE.  But, now that i realized that, i'm gonna work to stop that.  I  actually  like her, so i definitly want to try and be with her....let's see how things go on friday, not juss for us, for another 2 also... :oD (OOooOOOOOOOoOOoOOoOOOOOOoOoOoOOooooOOOoooOOooooOOOOOoO!)   oooooooooooo, i forgot, if ANYBODY has either the Franz Ferdinand, Modest Mouse, New beastie Boys, or d12 world, can u PLEASEEEEEEEE burn me a copy!?! or Maybe just let me borrow the CD's so i can rip em??! Thanx, k! LOVE YA!!!   Ok, well, i might update later, TOODLES!!  Song You Should listen to RIGHT NOW: The Cars - You Might Think (oOooOOooOOooOO!!!!!...i know thats what your gonna say)  P.S.:

      hey yall', i've been looking through some of my old entries lately, and wow...just wow. I've bitched about EVERYTHING.  Girls, to Freinds, to girls, and even some more girls.  My writing has been different too.  In the beginning, i eas more giddy and shit, now it's a much more serious tone.  lol, i acutally can't believe i wrote half the shit there, but out of all of them, my favorite entry has to be from 4/4/2004.  It just brought the most momories back, plus i think it's the longest entry i ever typed out.    but anyway, just had to mention that.  hmm, should i describe what i did yesterday? lol, lemme make a quick list:  bowling  jeane and dan LOTS of fun gonzo is the man splits i can't bowl for shit drag racing car sucks  the end   lol, and there u have it.  I'm acutally to tired right now to type the whole thign out, so maybe next time.  Acutally, if anyone is reading this, and see's me in person, just ask if you really wanna know that bad.    During bowling, John mention Jen. It was wierd to hear cause i haven't spoken with her in so long.  Well, maybe it's just me or something.  I dunno.  Yesterday was just kinda wierd overall, but TON'S-O-FUN. Me, John, and Gonzo were the bachelors of the night, and jorge was honerary.  lol, all this talk about girls is reminding me of that antioch joke thing i pulled, and the reactions.  In the entry after it, caroline mentions that she still thinks it's farah, or lilia.  Well, she was right about lilia, but it's just a recent thing, not anything i've been dreaming about since march, juss letting that be known.  Tonight at antioch is Christine's last talk at antioch.  I personally don't know christine very well, but she's very nice, and obviously very smart if she's heading to Harvard for College.  Speaking of college, i think i'm gonna chill with the major hunting for now.  I got a year left before i head out, a year to try out alot of differnet things, so for now, i'm just gonna stick my foot in everything, and see what i like more.  well, i'm tired now, so let's see what happens  bye bye now      lol

      ya, don't worry, there WILL be a time when i return to entering alot of entries, 2 more days left till school FINALLY ends...i got summer school, but i', still deciding wheather i should go or not.  hmmm, what else...um, today i had the U.S regents, damn easy i must say, but only the score can varify that.  Um, shit, well, Let's see, what else to say....(i'm trying to be all jumpy and funny like my earlier pots, i liked those....) well, right now i'm Listening to ELO (Electric Light Orchestra) - Love is like Oxygen.  Let me just say they have to be one of the best bands ever.  There up there on my 10 ten...well, maybe top 20....w/e, mad good.  On the subject of music, i still don't know if thats what i want to persue.  If it is, i'm going to a SUNY school anyway, but if i don't, i'll prolly go to another school, or atleast try to.  Right now the Only SUNY school's i'm looking into are Oneonta and Purchase...MAYBE fredonia, but i doubt it.  Well, hopefully i decide soon, ya know?  um, well, shit, my "write w/e the hell i want" meter is running low.....ummmmmmmmmm, what could i say to make your littel heads WORK huh??????? hmmm, well, i guess i can say i have a crush on someone right? lol, ya, that'll work..  ya, thats right, you read right.  Some of you know who it is, some of you don't, in either case i ain't saying shit.  Don't even bring it up, it's pointless.  I'll prolly tell SOMEONE, but only someone i can trust it with.  Why so secret?  the reason is as simple as it is stupid...cause i've never really kept my crushes on the Down Low.  simple as that.  well....fuck, let me just give ONE clue.....it's gonna make your heads spin...she goes to antioch.  all i'm revealing, nothing more...........well, maybe one more (see, it's hard for me to keep it secret!!) she's NOT blonde. thats it, thats all, no more, just had to say it, thats all.....NEXT SUBJECT!!!!  hmmmmm,. i need new guitar strings....for all 7 of my guitars.  Well, really, just 5, 2 i don't really play anyway.  On the subject, i really should be playing ALOT more than i am.  As of now, all i do is pick up my acoustic, turn on a song, figure out a good amount of it, then do alittle soloing, and maybe play the lyrical part of the song, then i drop it.  All of 1/2 hour, to 2 hours, and NOT everyday.  I mean, shit, i need to wake up!! i can;t do half the shit i used to be able to do!! but i'll come back.  MAYBE, just MAYBE i'll start taking lessons, MAYBE....we'll see how things go.  On a very, very, very, very serious note, i'm really worried about my mom, but even more worried about my Aunt.  You see, she was going to have a HUGE baby shower, EVERYONE was suppose to come right? well, acouple of weeks ago, she was giving birth, at 7, 8 months.  Now thats not HORRIBLE, i know some people that were born premature, it's ok at that point in the pregnancy, BUT, unfortuantly, she lost her baby....whats worse is, because of it, somethign happened to her blood, and she's using the support thing.  So yeah, my mom has been going CRAZY, she even broke her cell phone from the nervousness.  It's really horrible.  Something even worse happened to someone i know, but i won't mention it just yet.  but yeah, i'm only writing this becuase i really don't know what i should feel right now..  in past evtries i've mentioned that i've never had a death in my life.  And the one's i didi, i barely new the person.  Well, ya, i really don't know what i would do.  All i can do is pray that she'll be alright, cause were suppose to be going on vacation...and i know nothing would be better for my mom than to go on vacation, and to know my aunt will be alright.   ok,...wow, that was a BIG ASS buzzkill, sorry about that.  On another note, who remebers that band Blind Melon? I just DLed No rain, and it's a fucing awsome song i must say......you know what else i must say?  THANK GOOOODDDDD for giving me this taste in music.  I like EVERYTHING, i have TO MUCH, and i'm soooooo happy!! i got influences from everywhere, and i really appreciate it.  I think i like it cause i got this thing with being original.  I don't know why, it's like an obsession, but what ever.    HAHAHAHAA, i feel the need....THE NEED FOR SPEED!!!!    sorry, random pic.  Anyway, i'm listening to Soul Asylum - Runaway Train (good song, DL it!!) and there's this line:       Can you help me remember how to smile? Make it somehow all seem worthwhile How on earth did I get so jaded? Life's mystery seems so faded  I can go where no one else can go I know what no one else knows Here I am just a-drownin' in the rain With a ticket for a runaway train  i dunno, it go to me....it's a very cool song, you gotta listen to it.   hmmmm, what else....        i gotta get those tatoos i've been telling myself about.  Really....i've never wanted one more than i do now..   well, i think i've spent myself....and now, still not telling u who i like...

      lol, wow, i just re-discovered a song, and This being the last day of school for me, and seeing all the seniors for the last time,  this song really touched me.  There are 2 Versions, the Famous Beatles Version, and the Johnny Cash one, both are very powerful in, and lol, i can't belive this, i'm about to cry...The song is "In My life"    There are places I'll remember All my life though some have changed Some forever not for better Some have gone and some remain All these places have their moments With lovers and friends I still can recall Some are dead and some are living In my life I've loved them all  But of all these friends and lovers There is no one compares with you And these memories lose their meaning When I think of love as something new Though I know I'll never lose affection For people and things that went before I know I'll often stop and think about them In my life I love you more  Though I know I'll never lose affection For people and things that went before I know I'll often stop and think about them In my life I love you more In my life I love you more   Some other songs to remind you of Freinds:  Eve 6 - here's to the Night, Vitamin C - Graduation (freinds Forever), Greenday - Good Riddance, The Cure - Pictures Of you,   Alphaville - Forever Young (

      sorry caroline, but that line was way to good to pass up...  anyway, ya, i WILL go into what happened on saturday.  Only cause evryone else that was there already wrote about, and 2, cause i know u guys juss LOVVEE to know how i think :o))....  ok, enough of that. I'll try to keep it to the facts, and i'll clear up some false information that was said in other Entries.   ok. It's saturday.  What was so special? It's Me and Lilia's one month going out.  Good little accomplishment i might add. (sorry, but u HAVE to do something for your one month!)  Well, it was also Jones' and Caroline's one month too...and since Caroline wanted to eventually double date, might as well right? lol, well, ya, so saturday was the big day.  I woke up at around 11, 11:30, and started to get ready.  Went on the comp to play some music, and talked to jones. He too was going to get ready, and after some errands he had to run, he would pick me up.  I then proceed to look at my supply of Khakis pants...and holy shit...i have WAYYYYY to many...but ya, i go through, and immediatly discard the wrinkled ones.  Well, after the "filtering", i come down to the "Perfect Pair", but, i didn't really like the color.  So i go look in my dads closet, find nice white khakis, and try em on..there wrinkled as FUCK...i hate that about khakis, like, all folded and shit, the look absolutly fine and shit, but when u put them on, u see it's true colors...DAMN YOU WHITE KHAKIS!!! anyway, to top it off, NONE of those pants fit me 'perfect", so i had to wear the Calvin Klien belt i borrowed from my dad alittle tighter than usual, which i hate, cause it becomes annoying. Well, anyway, everyone knows black ALWAYS goes with khakis, so i was on a epic quest to find me a black shirt.  Couldn't find one. so i just went back into my dads closet and found one! problem is, it was a TAD bit tiny....roll the sleeves up?  o yea..   Anyway, some time passes, you know, last minute touches, the ol' shave, after shave, gel....cleaned the cat litter...u know.  lol, anyway, ya, i wait, and jones shows up.  I go up, and immediatly feel over dressed. He had khakis on too, but the ones with the side pockets and shit, and he had his Karate shirt on, with a black shirt over that.  i'm not saying he looked bad, i'm just comparing to show you WHY i would feel over dressed.  Anyway, we talk for alittle bit, and Finally get to our Lunch location, Casa de Nicola, in Croton.  There already there when we get there, and then they get out... WOW , the looked soooOoooo amazing.  Caroline had that skirt she was talking about on, and Lilia had that top she wouldn't let me see earlier on...and just whoa...caroline looked good, but WOW, lilia looked absolutly amazing...lol, i couldn't even compliment her as much as i wanted to! i was at a lost for words, i really was...she looked that damn good...but anyway, after we said hi, they informed us that the resturant doesn't open until like 2 (or maybe it was 3), which wasn't until another 2 hours pass by, so we immediatly begin to think of where to eat.  I thought of all the Fancy, fairly cheap resturants, and all of them seemed to be at the Palisades mall, so i suggested Romano's Macorroni (is that right?) Grill.  I've eaten there like 20 times before, so i know it's good, and there good with prices.  Well, i think this is how it went....we get to the mall, and are still deciding? i dunno, something like that, but....OO!! ok, nevermind, i suggested the palisades, and that we were gonna just decide when we get there.  THENNN we agreed on Romano's...there we go.  Anyway, we get there, and we all order our foods, chat, and just chill.  We ordered Fried CAlamari, and DAMN they where good.  Anyway, we had it planned that we were gonna go to the city, so after lunch, we head on over BACK to croton to catch the train.  We chill waiting for the train, and finally get on. Lilia and I sat opposite on jones and Caroline on the train, and we were all..."relaxing"...first of all cause we could, and second cause it was the local train....ya, long ride.  But anyway, we get to Grand Central, and it's still as beautiful as i remember it.  Jones mentions he loves it at christmas time, and i can't agree more.  I've been lucky enough to be in the city many times during the holiday season, and it dosn't get any more beatiful than that.  Anyway, we filled up our metro cards, and decided that the game plan was gonna be The Village, China Town, then Soho.  Well, me immidiatly leave grand central to go to Duane Reade...caroline wanted mints...well, whatever.  We get on the subway, and get to Christopher Street, in the Village.  We start walking around, and eventually see that were we gonna cross into queens....ya, to far..so we go back.  Then i go to the bathroom...AGAIN...you see, through this entire magic carpet ride, i have to go to the bathroom, it sucks SOOO much...i don't even know why, prolly the calamari or something...w/e it was, it sucls MAJOR ass...but anyway...we then continue to be in the Village. At one point, we head over to Barnes and Noble cause jones and Caroline read books apprently.  anyway,  ya, i looked around, and immediatly went to the New Age section, my favorite section.  Didn't find anything worth reading though.  And to clear up what caroline, AND jones both typed out, we weren't making out in the New Age Section, honestly.  Everyone so often during the walk, we'd give each other little kisses, and they just so happen to walk in mid-kiss...so there you go. anyway, after like, an hour there, we head out.  I got sushi in Lilia's head, so we then decide to go have sushi for dinner.  I've had CAlifornia rolls, so atleast i had some idea, but caroline and Jones both didn't want any.  But i must say, Lilia definitely go me into eating sushi...(THANX!!) anyway, jones had a big ass plate of pork fried rice or something, and caroline had Won ton Soup.  Well ya, after some argueing, the ladies finally wont he war against who was gonna pay...we leave, and then try to find a subway that we could take to Chinatown...that didn't end up happening, and we ended up walking from the VIllage, all the way to midtown...some might think that would suck...i acutally found it VERRRYYY awsome, and i think we should do it again...it's absolutly amazing to walk around manhatten at night, but to be with freinds, and g/f, just sharing it is even better.  After a LONGGG night, we finally take the 12:00 train out of there. On the way back, this guy that sounded drunk talked to kids about smoking, and even gave them the "talk"....very amusing...ones again me and Lilia "Relaxed" and from what i saw, jones and Caroline were reading the books they bought at barnes and noble...some humor books...something about sex, and another one about ninja's...  We get back, all nice and tired from our journey, and jones goes to drop of Lilia first, at which he then says we can use his backseat...so, ofcourse, i did. (!)....lol, anyway, after that rather long, yet appreciated goodbye, we turned around to go drop of Caroline.  After the said there goodbye, jones drops me off...i was DAMN giddy, but i can't tell you why.  Anyway, i get back home, and thats all i remeber doing..i might have gone online,but i doubt it... o wait, no, i talked to my dad, explained why iwas late,and thats about it.   Well, might as well go into sunday right??  Sunday was alright. i don't remeber doing anythign in the morning...i might have been with lilia.  O wait, no i wasn't.  wait...maybe...anyway, it prolly dosn't matter...i get to antioch, and it was raining, and i see carolines car, but no caroline, so i thought they were up at the church, but i decided to just chill in my car before driving up. wait..shit, that was another sunday! I just remembered...we all chilled that day!! OKOKOKOK  monday monday.....hmmmmm...... I'm pretty sure we hung out AGAIN, but i'm not sure. I think we did..and if we did, it was prolly just regular old chilling...WAIT...monday i think we played poker...yeahhhhh, thats it! that was awsome, one some cash, it was all good...lilia kicked ASS though which makes her that much more awsome.    Tuesday: we might have played poker that night, not sure. WAIT. NO. Me lilia, czank, benny, and mike chilled at Vet's for awhile...ya, thats it.  THen we went to 711 for a bit. Nothing to bad,  but it was fun none the less.  yesterday we chilled again. Picked up the girls, and went to shoprite to meet up with caroline.  Mike and Benny, and KC were at vet's waiting for us.  Well, we finally get there, chill, and wait for czank to get there. Czank gets there, but then we wait for andy.  This is somewhat torture cause alot of people were hungry, and pizza was on there minds.  well, andy makes it, and we head out.  We get to dominoes, and eat, and then everyone wants to go to starbucks, so we do. we chill there some more, i guess thats it. more happned, but i don't htink i should mention it here :o)....no, not like that..after that, we decide we gotta go somewhere else, so we head to senaqua.  After chilling for like 40 minutes, we decided to leave, which is when caroline suggests her house. (i think thats how it went).  Half way there, my car brakes down in the middle of the road..nothign bad happned though, just wanted to mention it.  We get to carolines house, and we chill in the back..when her mom said we had to go, me and lilia go in the back seat to say goodbye...but by that time, i'm tired, and kinda mad, so it wasn;t as passionate as i would have liked it to be.  Anyway, half way into that, the rest of the gang comes up.  ya...pretty much killed whatever i had...which wasn't ot anyway...i was kidna agry, but just pissed about alot of stuff at the same time, so if any of u were wondering why i looked mad..i was, just not cause of THAT...entirely...  Today: I was suppose to be with lilia today until 5:30, but things came up.  See, yesterday, she was able to leave earlier than expected cause she didn't have to go to her lawyer.  Well, apparently, she forgot that TODAY she has to go...and on top of that, it's her Step-dad's birthday, so they gotta go out...ya.  No idea when she's getting back, but it's ok i guess. After dropping my lil bro, Andy Im's me needing a ride for work, i couldn't, cause my car was beng a dick, and was fucked up like the day before, so i couldn't...sorry man. Rob called for a ride to, but that's on satudary, i might, i might not be able to, let's see how things work out.  Tommarrow: Friday.  A bunch of us are going back to the beach.  Always good times there.  Problem is, we also got invited to Michelle's graduation party, that being held at Hernendez', so i have no idea what were gonna do.  Well, beucase we'd be leaving early anyway, we'll prolly gonna go.  Thats about all i know so far about tomarrow...   so ya, there u have it, from Saturday to now....I just have to mention that Lilia's going this sunday, it is sucks soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much, it's unbelievable.  She's pretty much gone for the entire month of august, which sucks, cause summer school ends in like 2 weeks..god i'm gonna miss her.  I made her a CD and what not, of songs that remind me of her, or show how much i'm gonna miss her...things of that nature...but shit. I was talking to caroline about this.  like right now, i'm not to sad, but 2 days from now i'm gonna be SHIT....just watch me guys....When we hang out, i'm gonna be quite, i'm gonan be alot more reserved....less jokes and shit...i already no...but this is just a warning,...don't ask whats wrong, cause your gonna know anyway..It's kinda wierd looking back on the month....acutally, this whole summer really.  i can honestly say this has been the very best summer i've had in my entire life. florida/bahamas, Freinds, famly...g/f...god, this is really gonna suck.  Hopefully i'll get to see her during the time she's away. She's  just...to awsome, really, i can't even put it into words..like, i remmebr chilling with the guys, discussing the "perfect" chick for us..like, lilia is the girl i described, she's everything i've ever wanted in a g/f. Maybe thats why i'm gonna miss her so much. What's even better is she's MADDDDD cool with my freinds....a girl that fits into our group...NO WAY...and not only that, the rest of her freinds too!! *GASP*...lol, ya...i'm sorry, but i feel real lucky, and i've told her this...  anyway, thats it..i had to mention that she was leaving, or else it would get to me....if you've just read this whole thing through, congrats...now it's your turn to write an entry...  Counting down to 1 never sucked so much.. steve..

      just a song i like..i'll post something relavant later...   Don't want to be an actor pretending on the stage Don't want to be a writer with my thoughts out on the page Don't want to be a painter 'cause everyone comes to look Don't want to be anything where my life's an open book   A dream it's true But I'd see it through If I could be Wasting my time with you  Don't want to be a farmer working in the sun Don't want to be an outlaw always on the run  Don't want to be a climber reaching for the top  Don't want to be anything where I don't know when to stop   A dream it's true But I'd see it through If I could be Wasting my time with you  So if I'm inside your head Don't believe what you might have read You'll see what I might have said To hear it  Come waste your time with me Come waste your time with me  So if I'm inside your head Don't believe what you might have read You'll see what I might have said To hear it  Come waste your time with me Come waste your time with me Come waste your time with me Come waste your time with me  Come waste your time with me...

      ya.....these past cople of days have been crazy.  Alot of chillen, good times, and just memories....it sucks that more than half of the people i'm chilling with are going.  that includes some of my best freinds, and even my g/f, which sucks tremendous balls.  I know we have it off "better" than Caroline and jones, but still...it dosn't take away from the fact that she's about 45 minutes away..shit, my fucking car can't even go down the street with out some kind of problem.  But hopefully she'll wanna continue on with the relationship while she's in college...or atleast try it.  My biggest worry if that she finds some "uber-hot" actor or whatever, and just leaves my out in the cold....ya, that would suck BIG time...major ouch right there.  But whatever. I've yet to talk to her about it, and i really should. Maybe on friday, but it should be before...and it definitly shouldn't be after, so we'll see.  Schedule goes as follows: Today, rob called to get a nice game of poker going, which is awsome, cause we never (ever) got together to play poker for any reason.  We've all playhed it before, just never centered a whole gathering for it.  So yeah, that might happen today.  Thrusday: i have no fucking clue.  I would love to be with lilia that day, but i have no idea what she's gonna be doing.  Shit, i don't even know what i'm gonna be doing! I gotta go to Shop Rite (more below) but thats about it, so we'll see what happens.  I know the Guy have cigars...maybe i'll just get one, and we can initiate some male bonding....2 of our own are leaving.  Well, czank is the worse, like some 6 hours...benny is like 30 minutes...so yea.   Friday: BBQ at lilia's.  Appernetly her and Czank planned it out. There's suppose to be all of us there, and it's the last party she's gonna have in that house, so we gotta make sure it's gonna rock.  One thing i love is how both our groups are tied together in more than one way.  I think thats how everyone got along SoOOoO quickly.  But i love it.  In past years the Krew and i have always wondered, if any, were the kinds of girls that would mesh well with our "krewness".  The closest we EVER got was the twins, and christiansen.  But now look at it.  It seems that whether it be our g/f's, or thier sisters, or there freinds, they all come together with ours. lol, it's acutally quite crazy when u think about it.  But w/e, friday calls for a big celebration, new names on the freinds list, and an appologies (memories.....but shit, ya, we gotta go do that!). But ya, definitely looking foward to friday.  Saturday: me, lil, jones, and caroline are suppose to go out for lunch at this fancy casi de sesame street or something for lunch, and then were all apprently gonna go to the city, and just chill. (it's cause it makes a month i was going with lil, and same goes for jones and caroline...plus caroline wanted to double anway...) I have no idea how this is going to work out, considering us guys (me and jones) are suppose to pay, and i have a total balance of 5 cents in my wallet...and we've been strapped for cash cause of the vacation, so i'm prolly gonna get alittel, if anything, from my parents, and shop rite (more below) dosn't start for a good time.  But we'll see.  I'm having doubts again....why do i have to be the insecure one dammit?!?! i hate this role reversal.....   Sunday: This is the acutal day it's a month, but people are..."busy"...wanna know why?! (yea!) alrighty then...  All i know is that i have no idea what i'm gonna be doing. Caroline has a talk at antioch that night, so thats awsome, and thats about all i know.  We were gonna go out that night instead of sat., but to many things were gonna happen....  1. Let's say we did have dinner on sunday, we couldn't, cause we would have to have it early, cause we'd have to come back for carolines talk,a nd early dinner is basically lunch! 2. We couldn't have it after cause it;s sundays, and everything will be closed 3. caroline and jones are both leaving to their respectful trips, so they couldn't stay out late anyway....plus, they gotta say goodbye to each other..in thier own special way...  so there ya have it!  About shop rite...basically, i got the job, i just gotta wait awhile....like, 2 weeks...it's all good though, atleast i got it...  and well, some recent updates..i'm going to lilia's to heplp her pack up some shit...should be intresting.....   well, i'm tired now, so i'm heading out...  toodles, steve

      Let's see...hmmmMMmMM, how should i start this entry....ummmm, how about a list of what i did today, ya, thats the ticket!  1) woke up at around 6 cause of a dream i had about claudia.  No, not that kind of dream, it was actually quite innocent, and made me remmebr the fact we never said goodbye to each other :o(  Well, hopefully she's doing good where ever she is.  It sucked though, cause from  6 to 7 i felt really bad.  1.5) Caroline calls to tell me she isn't going to go to the city because of the weather, something i completely forgot about.  Turns out today acutally wasn't that bad, but we made plans for another day  2) Went to school after a breakfast that consisted of about 6 Strawberries. And had my contacts on for the first time at summer school too.  What was ironic was, that today i felt more awake then anyother time. Prolly cause i was still alittle excited that there still my be a chance to go to the City.  Side note on the city: I fucking love it...don't like it, love it. As i told every other person, i used to hate it...with a passion.  You see, like, almost all the family freinds live in the city.  Theres gotta be like 4 in every borough, it's ridiculous...anyway, long story short, we used to go pretty much every weekend, and i fucking hated it.  But the older u get, the more u appreciate, and now i can;t get enough.  I just typed all of that up to show a point that it sucked that i didn't go to the city today...that is all....go eat some gerber baby food, so babies can eat your souls.   3) got home, and went drving for awhile. Saw jorge, tunred around, swung by the arcadian, then came all the way back around to go pick up a job application in Croton. Got back, and my lil' brother was bitching about food, so i drove back down to the arcadian for some subway.  saw jorge, said whats up, then drove back...well, more like slowly tired to, cause my engine was fucked up.  You see, i turned on the AC for just alittle over 3 seconds, and my engine just says "fuck you....no..no, i don't want to hear it, fuck you"...so i BARELY got home, and when i did, it smelled like severely bruned *insert random noun here*.  So yeah  4)then went driving after like 2 -3 hours of doing nothing but think about what i COULD have done today.  We orderd Pizza, and i got to drive...yay!....came back home, ate like, literally 5-6 slices, and now i'm here, feeling severly fat.  So yah, there u have it, minus acouple little details, nothing importnat though.  It's about 7:44 right now...i m prolly going to head to the gym soon, cause i really do feel extremely fat right now. I'll head out as soon as my dad is finished checking the car...  I've rediscoverd my playing ability now that mike let me borrow his Metal Master.  I've been shredding that thing like there's no tomarrrow. It's awsome  Told my parents about the i-pod...weren't as pissed as i thought they'd be...but still, i felt like an fucking asshole  Been DLing High Fedelity.  Everyone loves it, and back when i saw it, i thought i was the only one that even heard of it!, let alone like it.  lol, no matter, i must own a copy...and yes, the illegal way will suffice for now.  I realized, time in general sucks major parrot cock.  It does.  Like, i never go by time, but i'm always around some kind of time-telling mechanism.  i can't escape it!!  been going through my music library, i realized i have a shit load of love songs in there.  Just noticing (see entry below)  Speaking of below, u prolly noticed the "roaches" pic.  Ya, thats the krew.  I spent a good amount of time making it, just to realize it looks like shit at the end.  W/e...it's easy to see Jones' came out the best, with mine second.  The pics weren't exaclty perfect, and it just turns out i have more of me and jones than of everyone else.  No matter, it's ok i guess.    Still have an urge to go to the city. But as stated above, tomarrow will have to be the day.  I wanna check out some tattoo prices, and just walk around...it's good to just go out with freinds and forget about life for a while.   Download Jimmy Soul - If You Want To Be Happy...trust me...you know this song, it's it's fucking awsome.  i'm sure your wondering what the title is about...well, i've been bitchin about time lately.  Like, i think it was today or yesteray 9see, there it goes again!) like, this whole thing just hit me. Like, wtf, literaly, wtf is going on. It fucking blew my mind.  Life was so simple back in the day. Nothin to worry about, but now look at us all, were all working, running around EVERYwhere with are cars, g/f, more freinds than we ever though posible....omg...it's lol, its' so fucking crazy.  If you told me 3 years ago that this would all be happening, i would have laughed in your face so hard...  ok, i'm tired, which means i should go to the gym now. I'm sorry, but i care to much in the way that i look.  Maybe its case i used to get teased alot...long story...want to hear it? call me...i'll be back in an hour or so  Doing everything you dreamed of -steve

      didn't go to see Anchorman, i was feeling like SHIT....like, a whole buncha stuff mix together, and i was just out of it...anyway, because of it, i cancelled the movie with rob...ya, i feel like an ass, but i couldn't go...i would have been to messed up...so anyway, i decided to go out for a ride...i like being by myself during times like that, cause u can just sit back, and think things over, but i also didn't want to waste gas, so i decided to see if Mike was at Jones'.  He was, and i stayed there the night. Benny showed up, but left.....i needed last night, so thanx fella's.  Today, or more, RIGHT NOW, i'm heading over to Somers to go work on my car with my dad.  I HAVE to talk to Lilia though, cause it's been like 3 days, and i feel like an asshole, so yeah.  I'll be back eventually...call my dad's cell phone if u want to know whats up.

      ok, so i lost my fucking I-pod....i'm suprised am not as pissed as i knew i once could have been, but w/e, the school is trying to get it back, so all is not lost.  It just kind of sucks cause i freaking got SOOOOOOo attached to it.  Like, that's something that always happens to me, i get attached to like, everything, pens, (hehehe, one more letter...) notebooks, u name it.  Sometimes it's rediculous, but w/e, that's just me.  ...so?? what have i done u must be asking yourself? lol, well, let's see..i  went to jones' house alot, and hung out with freinds alot,  dosn't get any more simpler than that.  I frankly don't remeber much cause i stayed up so late, but w/e, all i know is that i was there, and it was good times.  I spent alot of time with lilia, which, ofcourse, was awsome, but, OF COURSE  and  urlLink Jones'  house, so i decided to see if she was free, just to hang out atleast.  Well, after a apparent convincing, she got to go, BUT, i had to meet her mom, no big deal, right?!? WRONG!!! lol, i have this thing about first impressions, like, i hate hearing anything bad about myself, or any thing like that, so i got this thing with first impressions, like, i got to have them run smoothly.  Well, after some gel, contacts, and a spiffy shirt (thanx dad), i headed off.  And i must say, it wasn't that bad at all, i acutally thought i was gonna get asked to some tea, and then get interogated by her mom, but it was ok, no big deal. I still have to talk to Lil though, cause i have NO idea what she thinks about me! (sorry i haven't called btw, i meant to today, but today was just to hecktick....thats how u spell it right?) But anyway, we went off, and decided we were going to chill at a park....Senasqua anyone?  SUREE...cause apprently it was that movie night thing, and there were lot's of people.....ya, i don't think they'd appreciate there kids looking at 2 teenagers making out...lol, that would be so funny though...ANYWAY, we turned back, and decided that Croton was the prime place to be! RIGHT oh'! anyway, before i go any further,  let me just say, being with her is fucking amazing....ok, ONWARD! we get there, and we just walk around talk, which was great.  I was determined to show her my better side (my back side!!! woooo!!!!) and hopefully she saw it.  We talked alot, until the Super dooper PARK RANGER showed up...jeez, they should have let us stay, it's not like we were going to rape some squirrels or anything.  But w/e, we left, and ended up going to the train station.  we just sat back, and talked...lol, i bet all the guys are like "WTF!?! you didn't make out with her!?!", well, no, but that's totally fine with me.  I think i've said this before, but i really don't want to be to pushy with this relationship.  I acutally honest to god like her, and i acutally want to try and be with her for a long time, so, i'll just do what she wants to do, unless told otherwise...;o) lol, but yea.  My clock read 10, so we had to go...my curfew (?) was like 9:30....her's was 11, but thats ok, cause it shows i'm responsible!!!! ( yay!!) anyway, that was the night, and it was fucking awsome...  the next day, or as i like to call it, TODAY, was alright.  I took alot of shit from the kids about loosing my Ipod, i guess i kinda deserved it, but whatever. Summer school isn't to bad...acutally, it's painstakingly EASY, plus, i got the world famous Ceaser Alvarez in my class, so it's gonna be the shit.  got home, napped again, got up, ate, napped, got up, went to Jones', and came back to write this.  At Jones' we all just hung out (andy, me, jorge, Mike, ben, and sabby).  Mike took alot of shit as usual, which i really hate to see, but i hope he see's it's all in good fun.  ya, and i fucking hate milk.  Most of u know i can't drink it....no, it's not cause i'm lactose intolerant, but cause of the taste..and smell.....yuck, like, i always throw up....but i do love CHOCOLATE MILK!!! and any other flavor they decide to use to mask the mile one.  I'm saying this because, as i chocolate lover, i have to advocate....lol, no, it's cause that's THE ONLY THING TO DRINK IN THIS HOUSE....that, and water...which i have been drinking, which is fucking awsome i might add.  people have to update there freaking blogs more often!! I need my daily fixin!! i need it dammit!! it's the only reading i ever do, so i'f your reading this, and have a journal (which u prolly do) update it!!    shit....i think this entry took me an hour to write, cause it's already 11....w/e though, tomarrow's friday, and all i want to do is be with freinds, more specifically, my amazingly smart, cute, awsome, fun, etc, etc, g/f. (there i go again...)lol, i'm sorry guys....i am.....lol, ya, so, whats the line up? summer school, and chillin.....oooo yea.....BBQ's and Parties this weekend are gonna be crazy by the way..  Accidentally falling,  Stevie poo (?)

      you know, i've been thinking lately.  and, because of all the thinking, i realized that there's something happening to the way i feel about freinds...I left for vacation, and i said by to everyone..nothing special, but i should have done more....i missed on on saying goodby to the person i truly love....unfortunatly, they don't realize it.  These's feelings came about pretty recently.  I've always liked this person, and we've always been freinds, but i don't know, this whole thing is just driving me nuts.  He's my one, my only, my everything.   And now that he's gone for vacation, i'm lost, i'm desperatly lost. I need is pale, white, pasty skin, i need those glasses, those hats, i need those witty remarks, and large collection of video games, i need that skinny white welsh ass....i need my jonesy back..  I need him like a fay man needs cake.  I long for him.  The last week without him was absolutly devastating for me, and now, to come back, to nothing?! surely it's a joke.  But all i can say is that i love hime, and i need him here...jonesy-poo, if your reading this..come home...i need you...

      lol, looking at my  past posts i have to say i'm sorry for all those amazingly BAD typos...i don't want people to think i can't type or anything.  ok, now that that's off my chest...shall we get to the inresting reading part? (yes), ok then...  lol, my vacation is way to filled with detials to describe to you.  Sure, i have stories,  but nothing thats gonna keep you on the edge of your seats.  I'm going to spare myself the agonizing task of acutally typing it all out, so if any of you want to know how it went, your going to have to ask me. Sorry!! juss my attitude right now.  But i will start from the day i got back....mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, back.....(??)  lol, i come home and call jorge to see wahts going on, he's with Hernie and Michelle, and they trying to see what they can do.  During htat time, Jorge mentions Jones is gone, and left us the house, and that mike and Benny are over there.  So i think about it, and SHIT! i got's to go to jones'! lol, we juss pretty much chill the whole night (czank was there too by the way), stay up till 5 and shit, and wake up pretty early the next day. We planned that we where gonna have a BBQ, and a buncha people were gonna show up.  Well, that same night, i talk to Caroline, telling her of the plan, and my intent on Suprising Lilia.  lol, turns out, it worked out perfectly! UNFORTUNATLY though, we were locked out for some time, due to ben and Mike going to their houses. Totally fine though, i got to catch up with the girls (caroline, Farah, and Lilia). Anyway, we eventually get back in, and slowly but surely, more and more people show up.  At it's climax, there was about 10 people there: Lilia, Farah, Caroline, Inna, me, rob, Czank, Rick, Mike, and of course, Benny P.  Saying that, i have to admit we meshed pretty good.  I thought it was going to be more "wierd", but it turned out to be just fine.  Caroline had a previous arrangement to go somewhere, so she left.  and slowly but surely, rob left too (after kareoke revolution, and the eye toy, in which we had ALOT of fun..), leaving the rest of us watching Finding Nemo.  And i have to say, good movie, but i enjoyed where i was sitting better :o) (sorry!!! u had to be there...and nope, i ain't saying a WORD!) All i can say is that i'm really falling for lilia right now, and everytime i'm with her, it's better than the last. anyway, after the movie, czank dropped off the girls for me, and we went back home, which is when i fell asleep, but nope beofre waking up to close my windows due to the flash rain that decided to start.  Good night though. I wake up this morning pretty late, come back home, take a shower, eat, type this out, and here i am...  i've had my contacts on for 4 days streight  i watched finding nemo  Freinds house for a week  Surrounded by great freinds  with a even greater girlfreind  and juss came back from Vacation  can it get even greater? i hope so... :o)

      nice line jones...  ok, i'm back now....i was gonna write about talking with lilia, but that dosn't have to be typed.  I mean, i pretty muched summed it all up...it was refreshing.  You see, when Caroline came over jones yesterday, obviously being together, i was like "ehhhh", not cause they were snuggling, but cause i know i couldn't do it in awhile.  I also noticed they talk alot, something i would love to do more with lilia, so during that whole night i wanted to talk to her, and i was, but i was getting ansy.  Anyway, i forget how it comes to be, but benny let's me borrow his cell phone to call Lilia. (thanx again man)So i end up calling her...ya, it was great to talk to her.  We did the usual how are you, whacha been up to thing, and then we started talking about random shit.  But random shit is good.  Anyway, eventually jones was kicking us out to have "alone time" with caroline...more on that later though.  So i get home and call lil again, and end up talking until like 3...it was VERY refreshing...She's just that kind of person you need to hear from..like, a comedian or something, like, you always wanna hear what they have to say.  But ya, the events of that next morning is probably what turned me off to going to antioch that night.  Caroline IM's me, and it's the usual.  But, caroline likes to talk about what her and jones did or whatever.  Well, anyway, she tells me, but, like, it was like, i dunno, i guess the was she put it, like, it was like, weird.  And i guess all this stuff put together just got me upset.  Probably cause of the night before.  Like, Caroline went over, and we were all suppose to hang out.  But like, the whole time, her and jones kept on talking privately and stuff, and i dunno, it was like we weren't there...now, i have no problem with this, i understand that there time together is limited, but i dunno, i guess it was just the fact that they were doing it, i dunno, i just wasn't feeling it.  And i guess that emotion mixed in with the one that i got when caroline told me that they were together a lot longer then usual...like, it was almost like she "hung out" with us, just so she can say we did, and then go streight to jones...once again i know whats up, and it dosn't bother me, but, like, still, ya know?  Anyway, so ya, after that, i just couldn't handle it anymore, and i swiftly said good bye to Caroline on the internet, and i appologize for that caroline, if your reading this.  But ya, so after that, i really didn't want to go to antioch.  And i'm not mad at her, but, like, at the moment i was, but i'm cool now.  I appreciate that we have the kind of relationship were she's comfortable enough to tell me these things, it's great, but, like, i don't have to hear about it everyday, ya know? It's nice, and sometimes it makes a good conversation peice, but not during every single conversation.  Just think of it as everytime i talk to you guys, i talk about lilia, or i start a conversation with you, i talk about lilia. you know, it's kind of like that.  But ya, thats pretty much why i didn't go to antioch...childish? ya, i'd say so, but it blew over faster that way...i ended up staying at home...i was ABOUT to go to the diner, but when i was going, my mom said my dad is bringing home dinner, so i thought i would eat before i go...he ended up taking awhile, and it turned out to be too late, and my parents weren;t letting me out.  So there you have it.  I'm not mad at caroline, quite the opposite, it's just that at that moment, i was alittle bitchy i suppose.  O, that, and a long day of doing laundry and cleaning the house didn't help either. :o/  ok, now that thats done, what else....i already mentioned how great it was talking to lil, and why i wasn't at antioch...well, i guess the only other thing i can comment on is what jones said about college....we ARE fucked...and ya, we did stay up for that long discussing it.  I mean, shit, what else can we do? You can't blame us...this was one of the topics i was talking to lilia about when i came home that night.  I'm sure caroline and jones have talked about it too.  Basically, college guys own us...and if you haven't read jones' entry already, here's why.  1. Proximity: The obvious, and probably the most powerful advantage they have over us is Proximity, or there distance is you haven't taking English before (damn ESL kids..).  As jones said, i AM closer to lil than he'll be to Caroline, but where still a good distance away.  Caroline is about a 3-4 hour drive, while lil' will prolly be a good 30-40 minute drive.  So yeah, but either way, this really sucks.  Cause not only will those guys be close, but they be there like everyday.  So even if we visit, which we are, they still be there ALL the time, while we'll be there only acouple times.  More than enough time to work getting the girls...  2. Age: Though this isn't a big deal for jones, for me it's a BIG one.  I have a "late" birthday, which basically means i'm younger than most of the kids in my grades...i'm still 16, and i'll continue to be until the end of September.  Lil' has a sept. birthday too, which makes her almost exactly a year older than me...suureee, i know about the trends...more girls are going out with guys younger than them and shit, but with age comes expeirence, and that's probably why girls like older guys.  Now, i'm not saying i don't experience, but shit, they're older!  Jones dosn't have to worry about this...he's the "correct" age...he's just as old as the graduating seniors. But me...VERY young...not cool....I can see it now..."so, how old is your b/f....WHAT!.....you need a older man....."......fucking bastards...  3. College: Their in college for crying out loud...were still in high school....party's anyone?  Shit, and your with some crazy girl saying "go for it! he's cute!"....then all these other advantages these guys have come to mind....FACK....  4. Classes:  It's very highly likely that most of the guys hitting on the girls will be from one of their classes.  This obviously shows that they have SOME kind of mutual intrests, and thats how it starts. And even if they DON'T have the same intrests, guys will lie....sorry to bust our shit guys, but it's true, i've done it, you've done it, everyone has...some of us more than others.  I mean think about it, the more you have in common, the better right? then the whole courtship process begins...errrrrrrrrr....  5: Numbers: Croton...even ossining....the selction of guys are slim to none...i consider myself very lucky to go out with lilia...and like i've said, i've told her...i'm pretty sure jones feels the same way..but...in college...the guy population increases..TEN FOLD!. Sure, most of them will most likely be assholes, but shit, theres BOUND to be guys like me and jones there..fuck, you know what? it's garuanteed.  And maybe they'll have some characterisitics that makes them a "better" version of us....ya...FUCK.  But, ya, in a nutshell, thats the problem.  And the reason why college SUCKS.   hmm, what else...photo gallery is going down, but i'm not surprised.  I've never seen a website that david made longer than acouple of months, he always drops them..but w/e, czzank's got em' now.  I'm not mad or anything.  i need doom 3 right now.  hmm...thats about it....this is my last week of summer school, and that lady at Shop rite still hasn't shown up....yay.....  Playing way to much NFSU... steve
