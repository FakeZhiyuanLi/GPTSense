      I have a major assignment due in less 11 hours. And all I want to do is sleep and watch T.V. Sadaf just left -we were hangin' out for a bit. She picked me up and we went by Ariffa's....the baby is a cutey! What an adorable little boy. He's just over 2 months old now. This morning, I woke up early (okay like 8:30am --most of the world has started work by then). Saf called from Australia...I bolted out of bed to take the call. Anything for you, Saf:). It was great hearing about your latest adventures in Melbourne. After our 2 hour conversation, I finally dragged myself over to Starbucks for a latte so I could be ready to start work...well, I wasted a bunch of time, napped before noon, had lunch, and finally started around 2pm. I worked for a bit until Sadaf came by. We just had dinner now...the parents have some friends over and I'm ready to start working.  I've always been the world's biggest procrastinator. I don't think that'll ever change. But in the end, things get done...and I think I do a pretty good job when it comes down to it. Okay, back to work for me.  By the way, the time at the bottom of this thing is wrong..it's 9pm now.

      We got back from our trip late afternoon yesterday. It was sooo much fun. And remember how I was worried about the actual drive? It wasn't so bad after all. Sure, being locked in the car for hours with the family ain't exactly fun...but the time went by quickly.  The wedding was lovely. Friday night was the Mehndi, and Saturday was the wedding reception at the Sheraton (also where we were staying). It was my first time in NJ, and I loved it...so green and pretty. We had a lovely view of the Manhattan skyline from the hotel. Nadia and her family had booked a penthouse suite for everyone who was visiting to hang out in...which we did until the wee hours of the morning. My cousin drove in from Philly to attend the wedding...hadn't seen her in a year so it was nice to see her.  Sunday, we went to Long Island. My cousin lives there and a couple of my other cousins who live in Manhattan came over too. The next morning, Ray and I caught a train with Amir to Manhattan. The parents stayed in Long Island. This was the fun part...we spent all of Monday and Tuesday in Manhattan...it was so much fun! In the morning, Amir took us around...the Met, and Spanish Harlem (showed us a nice mosque there). We then met up with a bunch of cousins from Ottawa and New Jersey...so it was now 5 girls and my brother (plus one of my male cousins who later joined us in SoHO). We did a ton of shopping...and walking...my feet were red and sore. I got some really cute stuff. We were staying at my cousin's place -2 steps away from Times Square...which was really cool. My cousin has this Portugese roommate...very cute and really nice. He and Ray had to crash on the floor...I got the bed:) in the lone bedroom. Those manhattan apartments can be small and expensive.   Tuesday, we went by Rockefeller and 5th ave. While we were walking thru 5th ave in the pouring rain, we noticed a crowd piled up outside of the Barnes and Noble. So guess which former U.S. prez was around promoting his new book? That's right...Clinton! We waited around to catch a glimpse...we even got into the store..there were tons of people and press outside. It was hard to get a look because the cops made us move several times when we had a good vantage point. Oh well.   I had an epiphany of sorts. I finally realized that as much as I love NYC, I think it can be a really lonely city. I know a lot of people say it's not a good place to live, only to visit...but I always felt I'd love to live there. This last time that I went, I finally felt like I knew the city well...and it is a city that is limitless in possibilities...But I feel that amidst a throng of people, you can often feel the loneliest. So I'm changing my statement to say, I would love to be able to fly over there just to spend the weekend every now and then. Or, it would be soo much fun to be a student there.   Anyway, I'm glad that we came back when we did. One of my best friends gave birth to a beautiful baby girl this morning. Masha'allah. Congratulations to Deena and Walied!!! You deserve the best. I just saw her and she is the most precious thing.

      I think you're amazing.... George Michael's made a comeback. I can't get those lyrics out of my head. He has such an AMAZing voice. I love that song. Other fav's these days: hey Mama -Black Eyed Peas....such a great song-so upbeat--and that new one by Janet Jackson.    I still need to go see Supersize ME. Last time we went, tickets were sold out and we ended up at Mean Girls...which was a fun movie, too.   Last night, I pulled an all-nighter working on an assignment for this course I'm taking. Can't remember the last time I pulled one of those...But I do remember why I hate them.  Got back from class around 8ish today. Got let out early. Was super exhausted. Went to bed around 10:30, couldn't sleep, so here I am just hangin' out.  It's not the best thing when you're so tired and you want to sleep but you can't. There's all these thoughts floating through your mind. How did they get there? There was nothing that invoked them really. So I went downstairs and watched The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. He's Hilarious! The other day he had the director/actor of Supersize me, and today he had a journalist from al-Jazeera. His pokes at the Bush family always amuse.  I think I've reached a sleepiness point once again. Almost 2am. So I'm going to head off to bed, hopefully to blissful sleep:). Nighty-night.

      Countdown to the Malik family road trip...3 days to go. I can't remember the last time we all went on a road trip. This should be fun (not). Growing up, we spent countless hours during summer holidays locked up in a car together, weaving our way through various States. What will end up happening is my mom will want to listen to her classic Indian music and Pakistani Pop, my brother will drive like a speed demon, and my dad will be yelling at him to slow down. Yay. Tons of fun. Can't wait. Only 8 hours to NJ and a few more to Long Island. 12 hours in a chunk on the way back. Lots for me to do in the meantime. Major assignment due tomorrow, and as usual, I'm procrastinating (thanks to a certain someone who kept me on the phone till late, I'm sleepy all day). Will let you know if I survive the roadtrip.

      It's now month 5 of me not working. Can't believe how time flies! I've gotten used to having a lot of freedom with my time. I also take comfort in the fact that I have had job offers but I was unwilling to assume them because of my lack of desire to teach at certain schools. Ofcourse, the time has just flown by. And as you all well know, I think it was good for me to get some time off to heal. The positions that I would have assumed (45 students in a class, middle school French in the far ends of Brampton) were not conducive to great mental health.  So what am I up to if I'm not working? Things are somehow always busy. There's always lots going on. Sure, I sleep in till about 9-10am everyday (and usually nap later in the day --I LOVE them naps). It's great. I volunteer with a grade 4 class...they're super cute kids. I'm also tutoring a couple of students (one in gr. 6, one in college). I'm also taking a course in the evenings. Since I've returned from Windsor, I've gotten in touch with all of my old friends, and there's always coffee, dinner, movies, doing nothing and just plain old hanging out. I've also devoured a ton of books...Lots of great chick lit...flaky, light fun (thanks Raheel for lending me your collection!). Stuff that I never had time to do when I was working.  The odd thing is, I wonder whether people are ever be happy in the state they're in. Like when I was teaching full time last year, I would dream about being elsewhere (home, travelling). And now that I'm not working, I dream about working. Can a person ever truly be satisfied? I suppose there are advantages and disadvantages to both. I do know that whatever state, I prefer working because it gives you a heightened sense of purpose and the ability to do buy things (yes, it's shallow, but a necessity...everyone knows, I love to shop!).   Speaking of shopping, I've been really good lately. Although, I am making a little trip to NYC in a few days...can't wait, so excited. That's another thing you must know...I'm crazy about NYC. Ofcourse, the trip to NYC will be prefaced by a wedding. However, it's a wedding for a childhood friend (really happy for her;she deserves the best).  These days my major preoccupation is with whether I should visit Saf and Sally in Australia. I would love to see you guys again...and it would be a great chance to visit Oz. The other option is going to France for a month to study french. I LOVE France like it's nobody's business. I know you're all like, wow, dilemmas, dilemmas. But I'm really trying to plan so that what I do makes sense in the future. What I'd reallly like to do is take off for a year and teach/study abroad. That's something I've always wanted to do. Yet, I'm always plagued by having to be practical and adhere to the voice of reason (Mom & Dad). Sucks to practicality:(.

      So we went out last night. It's nice to finally do that when the weather's warm in T.O. which is like for 2 seconds. What I mainly realised is that although I can go out to bars and stuff, it's just not something I enjoy doing. Sure, I had fun. But the whole environment is just "ick" when you think about it. It was a group of us (including my brother); we went out to a majorly brown venue in T.O. I don't think I've seen THAT many brown people in my life. Okay, who am I kidding -we have lots where I live (not to mention what I am, and who's forgetting the trips to Pakistan...). But that's besides the point; it wasn't so much the uniformity of everyone, but the fact that it was a strange crowd. I guess the highlight of the evening was being able to poke fun at some of the characters. I know, I know, that's really mean. But whatever; it keeps things interesting. What was also interesting, however, was running into a couple of my former students. THAT was weird. They were in grade 12 when I taught them a couple of years ago. So maybe it's not that weird that they're out on the town in T.O. My, how quickly they grow up (haha...they're probably like 4 years younger than me).   Anyway, it's been nice to return to T.O. from a brief stint in a very boring and hick Ontario town. Let's be honest; Windsor sucked. I'm a cosmopolitan kinda girl. I need lights, colour, vibrant people, trendy joints, and atmosphere (even the smog in T.O. is welcoming). Let's just say the plaid shirts and truckers didn't quite cut it. The other thing that moving away really does for you is it instills you with an appreciation for all that you take for granted...Namely your parents, childhood friends, close friends, shopping malls, aestheticians, your grocery store, the perfect place that it took you forever to find...and all the things that make a home, a home. I think it's referred to as the genius loci, or the spirit that a place has. Every place breathes a spirit or life that is uniquely its own.   "To me, every hour of the day and night is an unspeakably perfect miracle."                                                                    Walt Whitman

      Seeing as this blog thing seems to be all the rage, I decided to jump on the bandwagon.  Why bother reading about the thoughts and details of someone's life. God knows. But whatever the appeal, I've decided to start up this blog to share with you some of the mundane and not-so-mundane insights of my life. Hope you all enjoy!     Definitions of Blog -- (weB LOG) on the Web:  Slang term for a weblog. A Web log, for the uninitiated, is a popular and fairly personal content form on the Internet. A person’s Web log is almost like an open diary. It chronicles what a person wants to share with the world on an almost daily basis.

      This was one incredible, mind blowing flick. I saw it last tuesday and was blown away. It is a masterpiece. If you haven't seen it already...GO SEE IT. It's one of those films that changes the way you think. Now, many of us are weary and suspicious of the media, the government, and the prez. But the insights that Moore brings, calls to attention many injustices and occurrences that the general public is unaware of. I won't get into it in too much detail. But parts of it were heart-wrenching, and coming out of it, I felt like my little problems are so trivial...I guess the beauty of the film is its ability to make you laugh and cry at the same time. Moore's oeuvre intersperses the comically ironic side of the Bush admin with the bone-chillingly frightening. And that is all I will say. It's brilliant.   On to other news...It's been a crazy hectic week. I had some full days of class with mega assignments. I just finished a 3month course...I'm now able to teach at the junior (4-6) level. I also managed to tackle the mounds of clothes and belongings that needed sorting...it's somewhat a cohesive, organized unit now. Oh, and good news...I have a job this month. I'll be marking provincial gr 6 standardized tests...   Today was a lot of fun. I tutored in the morning (not the fun part -I'll get to that), went to a good friend's bridal shower (it was lovely and intimate), caught a Shakespeare play, and hung out in Little Italy afterwards. I hadn't discovered Little Italy as yet...it's such a cute little part of town with tons of good looking people and patios. I LOVE the summertime...the weather's great, you can run out the door on a whim with no coat, and there's always something going on.
