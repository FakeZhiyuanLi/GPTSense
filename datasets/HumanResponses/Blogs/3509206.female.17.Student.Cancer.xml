      Well, I think this is going to be interesting. I hate hand writing in journals, and I recently just found this amazing site that all I have to do is type, and well, out comes this journal. It even has spell check, wow, can it get even easier.   Some may be wondering, "why make a journal, what's so important for you to say and for us to listen to". Exactly my point. Let's just say it's a fresh start to my self realization. Yes, I haven't been exactly finding the real me in others, so I though, why, a good start is to stop taking what other people say too seriously and just focus on me. I have much to say, and I hope that my procrastination doesn't result in this journal not being written in for days on end.   Well, what can I start with. School is killing me at the moment. I hate work. It's a pet peeve of mine. But I've got to live with it. The only thing that's keeping me going is knowing that it's all over in two weeks, excluding exam days, and summer is oh so very near. Cheerleading, what can I say about that. It's fun. The people there are great. It's an over all great experience. But what if you wake up in the morning dreading going to practice that day. That's exactly what I'm going through. I haven't found an activity that I could stick with for a longer period of time. I've tried ballet, ballroom, polish dancing, track, cheerleading, and I feel that I'm still missing out on something, and that none of these is really my passion. So I've decided that two years in cheerleading is enough for me. Maybe I'll go back to track next year. We'll see how it goes.   Well that's enough writing for tonight. Don't worry there will be more to come.  Take Care. Don't drink and drive. :) Tootles                                   -ela

      Welcome to my summer.........What is it exactly that I'm doing right now. NOTHING. LOL. Well relaxing before camp. Camp is in a week. I'm excited. It's real fun. You don't have to believe me, and you may think as if going to camp is a little odd. It's not. It's way more than that. Well I'm not going to spend all this time explaining about it. So I'll change subjects.  My birthday is in 6 days. I'm turning 17. Wow, how slow getting older is. Anyway.....I don't mind. More time to have a different kind of fun. I don't like birthdays, well my birthdays. It's a normal day. I like going to other peoples b-day parties but not mine. I don't now why. But I just like it that way. And I'm not sad, I'm happy, so it's all good.  Well, i have to get back to doing nothing, I think the laundry is done. Got to check on that.  Tootles           -Ela

      Well yesterday and today are much better days. I guess you get one of those days once in a while where u think you're going to lose it and nothing can help.   I got a nice t-shirt tan on one side of my arms at the picnic at our church. I wore my new skirt that I made myself. It looked sooooooooo pretty. LOL. I liked it.   well I think it's about time to shave my legs. They've been hairy for too long. But it's not like they're so visible and all. They aren't. LOL. Well its a nice day. I'm off to do stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Tootles.

      Holding it in, going to lose control any second, got to seem strong, got to seem tough.  How much longer will this shit last, how much more of this am I going to have to hold back.  Have to pretend it doesn't hurt me, while inside I weep.  At times it surfaces, I let out my weaknesses, but no, never again, I am not like that.  I am not who you think I am. I am not what you expect me to be. I will not give in to your schemes. I will not become just like you. I forgot who I really am. I forgot what it feels like to be happy. I don't know what I like anymore. I don't know what makes my happy.  I want to change me, I don't like who I am. I want to become a different person, different pleases me. I will hold in what I can. I will never forget how you did me wrong. I am who I am. I don't care what you think.

      My father and I ate dinner together alone at the kitchen table. A very awkward moment in both our lives. You see my mother hadn't get come home from work and my brother hadn't come home from his residence either. They're both late. And I always make dinner on time so well, my father and I ate. It's not that my father and I don't get along it's just that we really don't have anything to talk about. It's either him complaining at me for watching TV when he wants to, or me complaining to him why he leaves the kitchen a mess. Well, we sat in silence. In uttermost silence. He usually takes his dinner plate and ate in front of the TV, but no, not today. So sat looking at my plate, him at his. Eventually he sat beside the TV. It was the longest 10 min of my life. I ate almost nothing so slowly that it took forever. Well my mother just arrived, I have to talk to her about her day, and o crap! I was supposed to make a list of groceries, o well. I'll do it quickly now.  Tootles

      Well today I woke up nice and early for no apparent reason. There is no school today, no early appointments, no flippin' reason at all. Yet I am totally awake and functioning well. I woke up at 5 am thought, " it's my first day of summer vacation go back to sleep". Then every half hour I woke up, and made myself crawl back into bed. At 7 I finally decided there is no point in this all and got up. My father was still sleeping my mother already left to work. With nothing else to do I went on msn. Then checked out the forum. I found myself watching the college years of saved by the bell. Even though I've seen all the episodes it still interest me. Anywho, then I started watching this movie on the superstation, don't remember what it's called but it's an ok movie. I started watching Live with Regis and Kelly. The shows been better before. Now it's so repetitive, it bores me. They should get like Brad Pitt to go on the show. Then I'd watch it.   Well, I have a few things on my agenda today. I have to wash my hair, do some grocery shopping for tonight's dinner which I am making. Then possibly do some laundry, vacuum, clan my mess, wash my bathroom, and the list goes on. I'll be happy if I get the first two done. LOL.   Well I think it's time for that shower. O man I hate walking to the store. There's so much construction going on and all the guys working there start screaming something in Spanish to me. I just ignore them. I feel so violated. LOL. I need to learn Spanish so I can yell something mean back to them. LOL. And they're all ugly so yeah.  well I'm off...............Tootles

      I'm tired of all of this, you know when you get into one of those hopeless moods where you don't want to do anything just sit at home, but you also don't want to sit at home. I hate it, despise it. LOL. All I can do is laugh. Crying is for the weak. I don't think I have reached that point yet. I am lost. I don't know who to listen to. Who to believe. And I have lost friends because of that before, but they don't understand that I care about them, that I really don't mean what I did. I cared so much about them that when I heard something about them I started to doubt that that friend was really my friend, maybe it was a game they were playing, just to make fun of me in the end. I think like that a lot. I think low of me. But that will never change. You need to understand that. That that's who I am. I'm sorry about everything. But I feel that I'm the one always saying sorry. I have feelings too. But you don't seem to see that. What can I do, but think, I need to stop thinking. I always tell everyone that but I should start listening to myself for once. I need to take under consideration about my feelings. But I'm scared that others will think I'm conceded. When really I'm not. I know I shouldn't care what others think. And I also tell other people that too. But it's hard. It's hard not to care. Very hard not to care.

      I need you right now.  Right this minute.  I have no idea who you are.  I don't know if I already have met you.  Maybe we're friends.  Maybe there's something more between us.  I just know that I'm alone.  Some thing is missing and at this exact moment I'm falling apart inside.   Who are you? Where can I find you? Help me out please? I know you are out there. You're watching right this minute.  And as you read this, you know there's nothing you can do. Time will explain everything. Well, I want it to explain now!  Why is this taking longer than I hoped it would.  Why can't you see that I like you. I don;t want to be blunt about it. But I wish you'd give some kind of hint.  Maybe you're not the one.  If not, then I'm happy that we're just they way we are. But if there is more..... I want to know.  But only, when the time is right.  And it seems as if I can't wait any longer, time for me is right now. And if not for you.  Sorry. I waited out as long as I could. But there's still a chance.  I'll be waiting for you. For the one, who I don't know.

      The sound, the known anger, the blinding dramatic light. Last night was scary as hell.   Ok so it may sound a little too over dramatic, but I was surely scared as hell. I dislike thunderstorms. To begin with a quick flash of light is never good. It's like turning around to see a train a second before it hits you. Or like they say, when u die you'll see a bright light. You see that lighting is not a good thing. And thunder. It's like a loud crashing noise, and that means destruction. As you can see this whole thunderstorm thing is so awful. I like rain. I love rain. But just Rain. Alone, with no extras.   Ok, well I'm sleeping when suddenly I wake up because of the storm. I look at my clock it's around 12:30 ish. The rain is falling in my room, so I go across to the window and close my window. The second I am doing that I see a flash of light, then the sound of thunder and then all the street lights go out. I glance at my clock and it's flashing. My heart is beating at it's fastest. I'm a little chicken when it comes to these things. I have a fear of getting struck by lightning. I try to convince my self that, if I do get struck then it's ok. It's not my fault I couldn't prevent it. And dying is ok. But last night I was scared to death. I considered going to my parents room and crawling into bed with them as I had done many many years ago. But I was too afraid of opening my door and crossing the hallway. So I jumped into bed, put the covers over my face and ears, and a while later found myself fast asleep. I woke up in the morning tired as hell and oh so hot. I shouldn't have covered myself with all the blankets and closing the window wasn't a good idea.   Well, that's all for today folks. Now you all know one of my fears. And I tell ya, there's way more to come.   Tootles         -Ela

      So I lied, I said I'd write tomorrow but I didn't. Too much to do, and I don't always feel like writing. So Thursdays athletic banquet was awesome. I had heaps of fun. Wish it would never end. Our table started out being Andrea, Liz and me. Then a group of guys joined us, because well, we're just so great to get along with, LOL.   Saturday was also really fun. We had our bieg for scouts. Then the picnic afterwards, where I got to see the guy that came from Australia that I haven't seen for almost a year now. It was great to hear his Australian accent, but he's lost some of it. That's too bad. The guys played soccer, us girls had a water fight, then we played volleyball. My arms are nice and burning at this moment, but they're not as bad as my face. It won't be that bad tomorrow, I hope. Hehehehe. Then I slept over at Gosia and Ania's house. We rented American Beauty. It's a twisted movie. I guess if I saw it again maybe I'd understand it a bit more. But the young crazy guy who films everything in the movie is hot. In a mysterious kind of way.   Today we had Boze Cialo at our church. So more sun and walking around the neighborhood in our scouts uniform. It not that bad. After that my family and I went to my cousin's house for her birthday get together. She turned 5 last week. And see gets hyper and more hyper by the day. I ended up taking a nap on my aunts couch. I don't know why I was so tired. I got like 10 hours of sleep last night. I'm going to blame it on all the sun. hehehe. Yes, that's a good excuse.   And now I'm trying to study for my first exam. Drama. It's a written exam and well, I am not good at that. Oh well, I'll try my best. But I hate studying. We'll wee how it goes.   I'll write more when I got time, or something interesting happens.   Tootles     -Ela

      Well, before this post I was improvising a poem. I got fed up with it because it sounded corny, even though it was from the heart. I gave up writing poems for a while. And now I remember why. hahah. oooooo.....Good times.  Well the heat has been awful today. It leaves me weak, unable to breathe at times (just like the song by Maroon 5 - harder to breathe) it's a good song. But the sun always leaves a smile on my face. We're learning about different religions this semester. Mostly about spirituality. I feel that in my life, especially at this moment, I am lacking in that section. I don't have time. I really don't. Does that make me a bad person. I sure hope not. It's just that I really don't think I can calm myself down to the point where I am totally silent, with no thoughts in my head, or anything to bother me for that matter. Something always comes up with is urgent, and well that is my first priority. Maybe later it will change. We'll just have to see.   I am currently memorizing a monologue for drama class. It's from the movie and book "white oleander". It's real good. But it's deep stuff. hahah. I'd like to end up seeing this movie. Maybe with my mom. It seems like one of those mother and daughter movies. oooooooooooo, u know what I haven't had in a long time. A movie night. I need one of those. Hmmmmmmmm, what movies, so many that I want to see but I am completely blank. Oh well. My memory isn't as good as it used to be. Wait, a sec. It was never that good to begin with. hahaha.   Ok well I got to get back to memorizing it, and also the French project and studying for the science and fashion in class exam. yay!!!!!!!  Tootles     -Ela

      Yeah I found this funny quote today:  New!  Improved!  Instant ass hole... Just add alcohol!  Ooooooooo, that was good. It's not always true. But it can give you a good laugh.   Well today was a long day. It has been, and will continue to be the longest week of school. And the reason behind it is, that it's the last week of school before exams and well, it just drags on. Today was the last day of scouts. It's about time it's over. It's been going on for too long. But it surely has been worth while.   The heat is coming in. And life with out A.C is going to kill me. Oh well at least I got a nice and cool basement to turn to. Except for the fact that it's unfinished, dusty, and scares the heck out of me. I'll get used to it. Not to worry.  Well, I officially need a break. Just to get away for one day, or longer. Maybe go to the beach, or somewhere nice. Away from my family. Somewhere with friends. After exams and before camp. That's the perfect time. I need time off from thinking. Yet, there will always continue to be a million things going on at the same time and I'll get so lazy that's I'll probably end up finishing none of them. Well, that's me for you. One big procrastinator. I try not to be. But it gets the best of us, sometimes.   Ok, I have so much to do and maybe I'll end up doing something.   Tootles        -Ela

      It's been a rough two days.   Do some people not understand that if they act a certain way while they are drunk that they should not drink as much or be more aware of their actions. I know they mean well, and they aren't really proud of what they have done, but if it repeats itself more than once then you seriously need to rethink a few things. You are not only hurting yourself but others as well. If you were in your right minds then maybe you wouldn't have done those things again. Think twice people. I tried to help as much as I could that night. I did my best, but you still screwed things up. And it's up to those who you hurt to make things right again. It's only those people who can forgive you for what you've done. I am disappointed that you could've acted those ways. And I know you didn't mean for it to happen, but you did partake in it so it is your faults. But that is all I'm going to say. All I know is that if I were you, I'd think things over way more than twice next time when you're in the same situation.   And man, I just wish my family would see things my way for once, They just like to see things their way which makes them look right all the time. Well, they're killing me inside. They don't understand that what they say, what they do, their little "innocent" comments really beat me up. They can't see that it hurts me but make up poor excuses like, you're just tired and don't know what you're talking about, or, don't let your situation with friends right this moment interfere with your relationships at home. When in reality there is nothing wrong with me. It's them. They're against me or something. Then a second later they act as if everything is ok, well it's not. And I will not act as if everything is ok. I will not be mean, but I surely do not forget when someone is being unfair to me. It makes me mad, and really I am lost. I don't know what to do. I'd like to run away but there's no where to go, and when I'd come back they'd just get mad at me for trying to runaway from my problems when really I'm trying to runaway way from the people who create them.   Well, I feel better now that I've vented.   Tootles         -Ela

      So I haven't written in here for a few days now, I couldn't find the time.  We'll start with  Friday: Garbage picking day. It was fun. Well except for the whole picking up garbage part. Nah. It was good. Found a lot of interesting stuff. Tires, clothes, etc. And Trojan did win against Durex. Hahaha. My body hurt so much from picking up all that stuff then walking to and from church. Yup, it just was a fun filled day.   Saturday: Started off by walking to school for the cheerleading competition. We got 2nd place, which is really good. Came home. Got all ready for Lukes party. Went to Lukes party. And well what can I say. Maybe I can put into words everything that I want to say later. I can't seem to find the words right this instant.   Sunday: Came home at 2:30 am. Woke up at 6:50 am. Went to church nice and early. Came home and watched TV until 1pm. I just finished watching an old movie on TV. It's called "Three came home". A very, very good movie. I'm fond of old, black and white films. And this was exactly just it. About how the Japanese took over. A ladies story of the whole thing. The rough times they had to go through. Trying to keep herself and her little boy alive. Then at the end Finally being able to see her husband after many years, and thinking this whole time that he was dead. So emotional. I usually can hold it in. But this time I just bawled. Couldn't hold it in. I don't like being so emotional. People assume you are weak, and fragile. While I'd rather be strong and tough.   Well, I'll write more later.   Tootles     -Ela

      Well, it sure had been a crazy filled day. I've lived it to the max. And not even a sec. Was I bored.  It started off with waking up after like the longest sleep ever, and I was SO tired. It was crazy. Then came school. Fire drill. Lunch outside in the nice sunshine. Then lounging around in fashion class. And then came THE LAST DAY OF CHEERLEADING PRACTICE. O man. I haven't worked my butt off that much in so long. Even though I dreaded coming to practice that day, it sure was not that bad. But my mind is made up, I'm not going to change my decision.  Well at the end of practice our couch is like there's a dinner thing tonight at 6. We want like the 5 of you to come. So we said sure. I got home at 5:30, dressed up nicely, got to the hall around 6:15. And what a fun night it was. So many jokes.....Well there are always a lot of jokes. First on the drive there these construction guys tried to pick us up in our car. Ewwwwwwwwww. They were old. Then at the hall an old guy wanted yola to buy him a drink. And he kept stalking her. It was a dinner for all these athletes in mississauga. It was cool. Free food. That's all I can say.  And here I am. At 11:38 pm. Having a bunch of stuff due tomorrow. I don't think I'll ever finish. And then I got to shower. Bah! hahahaha. All I can do is laugh, because I'm so tired and I don't think I can stay awake any longer.   I haven't had time to think at all today. So now is my thinking time before I go to bed. Because if I don't think now, I'll go to bed and I won't fall asleep because I'll be thinking too much. So first of all, I have to remember to live my life for me. I have to plan things out and not worry if someone else is doing something that same day and I might want to go there, even if it's not for sure. Because if I'll do that I'll end up staying home doing nothing. So I need to plan things according to me. You may not understand, but I don't know how to explain, it's all clear up in my head, but when it comes to typing it out, yeah, not so good at that.   Okej, I need to get other stuff done, so I'm done writing for tonight.  tootles           -ela

      I had the best nap ever! As I lay in my bed the sun shone threw my window and warmed me up. I soon found myself in deep sleep, and had no worries at all. Not having a certain time to wake up or anything. Then Waking up after a few hours, feeling more awake than ever. And I sit here now, in front of my computer slowly coming back into reality, and still in my pajamas.   Today has been a very tiring day. Not that I did so much today, just the fact that every little thing tired me out. And some people noticed and knew to stay away from me and give me some space. I was also very emotional. I found myself during science class tear eyed for no reason at all. Possibly because of everything right now is overwhelming me, maybe.   But I really appreciate those friends who you know can always be there to joke things up. They don't do it on purpose. They're just naturally funny. And that's the best you can get. A few jokes before heading home, made my trip home more lively.   This is one thing I hate. When you know that someone wants to talk to you, but they made a promise to themselves that they will wait until you speak up first, but clearly, when you do talk to them they hardly seem interested to talk to you. But you know that they're just trying to be the better person and stick to what they say, when the truth is, that the better person would just confront the other person and talk things through.   Well, i just needed to get that out. And i feel much better. I'm finished writing for now. if more comes to mind, you'll be the first to know.   Tootles -ela

      All these things to do, in such a short period of time. I doubt if I'll get the energy to get anything done. The weather sure plays a big role in everything. Not only is it gloomy outside, but I get these massive headaches at the back of my head that a mandatory nap on the bed is in order. If not, I think I'd die from the pain. Well not literally.   Bah........This is when I'd really like to crawl into a ball and disappear, just until everything gets sorted out. So many things running through my head. Holy, I never knew I could store that much stuff up there.   I need to do something fun, and soon. Well maybe this weekend will fulfill all of that. Being with friends is always fun. A road trip would be cool. Now if only I'd get my G2 before the summer. But no, I'm going to have to wait until October.   The time is coming when soon I'll be another year older. So much has happened in the sixteenth year of my life. I've learned so much. I went through a lot. It surely has been the best year of my life so far. When I come to think of it, I am real young. I haven't lived half of my life yet. I'm really excited to get older and see what more knowledge I can acquire.   Well as for now, I'm going to go with the flow. And try to not lose my temper, be positive, and smile. Got to keep a damn smile on my face. Why? At least I'll make others feel happy. But that's going to be be tough. But I can do it! Hehehe :)  Tootles.....Until I write again..........ela

      That fresh smell of falling rain. The sound it makes on the rooftops. Man I love the feeling that comes along with it. It makes me just want to curl up and sleep. Well, I do need my sleep. And being tired is more common to me. I don't know why. I don't have an explanation for the way I've been feeling for the past few days.    >  Now back to what I was talking about. I'm not stressed out, I'm not going into depression. Am I talking crazy here. I've been thinking a lot. But it doesn't seem a lot. I don't know how to make sense of it all. I need a vacation to get away from this all for a while. Meet new people. Experience new things. That's what I strive for. Yet, my shyness always interferes. I can never get the courage to do things I'd love to do. Maybe one day that'll all change.   It's thundering right now. I hate thunder. Makes me feel all helpless inside. Won't it just go away. That's one of my fears. I also hate the dark. I can't see anything, and that scares me. Wow this thunder is loud. Make it stop! Sorry just getting a little paranoid right now. You know being home alone and all. Not knowing where my father is at the moment. Loneliness is filling up my house along with me inside. But that's what MSN is for. To talk to friends and hope they'll be there by your side.   Well, now that it's raining there goes the whole rollerblading with scouts idea. Seems like it was never meant to be.   Well, what more can I write. It seems that every guy I like either likes someone else, or just isn't interested, And most guys that like me, I just don't feel anything there. Or, maybe I'm just scared to feel. I'm not to sure. But I've learned not to dwell too much in that area, for it only takes away for all the happy times I could be missing out on. If there really are happy times in between, I'm not sure. But that's what people have been telling me.   Well, I might write some more later on tonight. After scouts. Maybe something interesting will happen.   Tootles        -ela:)
