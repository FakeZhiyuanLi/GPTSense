      Enjoying my first real taste of free wireless broadband, thanks to a hugely expensive stay at the Malmaison. My usual, much cheaper refuges in the Dear Green Place (Campanile, Premier Lodge) are all booked up due to the presence in town of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. So here I am. Spent two hours this afternoon in the Lismore Bar, in Dumbarton Road (McEwan's 80 and IPA, both good). First time for years I've sat in a pub alone for that kind of period. The Lismore, a new/old pub with a semi-Gaelic, or at least islandic character, has some interesting contemporary stained glass and artwork, and a cosmopolitan clientele. It's a kind of interface between traditional Partick and bearded Westendism, with the worrying possibility of folk music, from the pictures on the walls. Ah well. Not that all folk music is worrying. Of course. Only if there's a bodhran present. Saw The Day After Tomorrow last night, which is unintentionally hilarious in parts (Dennis Quaid spouting pseudo-scientific jargon, the wolves) but, if you could cope with Independence Day, entertaining in way that made me nostalgic for all those 70s disaster movies like Towering Inferno and Earthquake. The global warming message, though, is dopy beyond belief...though the fact that my house is approximately 15 feet from the sea, and has been flooded twice in the last 30 years, did keep popping into my head.  It's so easy to fall back in love with the ease of living in a city...a big, dirty, heavily populated one like Glasgow, which holds so many crucial aspects of my history in its grimy old vaults. Noodle bars like Canton Express and, well The Noodle bar, for example, you just don't find even in Aberdeen...massive, excellent meals, soup, tea, meat and noodles for £8. Great bars, the Underground, bookshops and tomorrow's newspapers tonight... Back on the train to Aberdeen tomorrow...the fact that you can travel first class at weekend on a second class Scotrail ticket, simply by paying an extra £1.50, is a Very Good Thing.

      End of the week in Lerwick, and I had to drop a car off at the Holmsgarth pier for a pal to pick up when he comes off the ferry tomorrow...that meant catching the bus back home after the show.          Not always a prospect to fill one with delight, but tonight was great: the Marlix for a pint of Guinness, consumed in the chill-out hour between coming off air and entering the world of bus...Just the one pint, otherwise the horrors of bladder-bursting busdom beckon. Ordinary, not Extra Cold. Still too icy, but perfectly acceptable.          Guardian G2, a double seat to myself, and within 10 minutes, I'm asleep as the bus rumbles north, waking up at the Ollaberry junction as the folk for North Roe and Ollaberry itself are disgorged. Dropped off at the bottom of the driveway leading to our house, refreshed and ready to face whatever the evening brings...          ...which, returning to the past tense, was a decision that my old folding Dahon bike was not going to stand up to my 16 stones over five days upcoming trailing around Scotland by bus, train, ferry and bicycle. I got three miles down the road before I realised just how flexible that frame was.          So the great BBC Tom Morton Train, Boat and Bike tour will be at least partially aboard the trusty titanium Raleigh. If it folds, it'll be an acccident.

      Guinness, please. “Would you like that Extra Cold or Regular?” “Regular, please. Ordinary.” Of course, it doesn’t come regular or ordinary. It virtually freezes my lips and innards into a black Arctic intestinal and oral goo.  If this is ordinary, what is Extra Cold like? The barman assures me that this, indeed, is normal Guinness. Good grief.         The best pint of stout I ever had was in Cork, way back before Murphy’s was available outside Ireland. It was, literally, a transcendent experience. I have never since enjoyed a pint of beer more. Compared to the harsh draught Guinness I was used to at the time, Murphy’s in its place of production was creamy, silky smooth, a caress of a drink.        I may be wrong, but I seem to remember Murphy’s making big inroads into Glasgow drinking at the time of the great Guinness/Ernest Saunders scandal, when people switched on moral grounds. But no pint of Murphy’s since has matched that Cork experience.        And it wasn’t cold at all. It was cool.

      Aberdeen, and previously Glasgow. Too long away, and no way of getting back until Friday, when the boat sails late enough for me to get the car on board after work.        Shetland, the Zetlandic Archipelago, capital city, Coalfishreek...I miss it. Well, most of the time. All right, some of the time. I have to admit that Tuesday night's restaurant and pub crawl around Aberdeen was pleasant, with balmy weather and the company of two briefly beached Shetland residents, Joe and Paul. Nice pint of IPA at Under the Hammer (Shetlanders at the next table), then dinner at the excellent Bistro Verde (scallops and halibut, cooked to perfection) followed by a pint of something called Lusty May at the legendary Prince of Wales. Rounded off with (for me) a second viewing of Shawn of the Dead at Vue. Funnier than the first time.         The Jim Beam (white label) at home was a mistake. There's something weird about bourbon. It doesn't get you drunk, just leaves you stunned for large portions of the following day. or perhaps not you, but certainly me. Fortunately, a Herds steak pie and effervescent vitamins lifted things in time for the show.          LATER...End of the show, and a pre-recorded interview with the legendary Richard Thompson, complete with a song, performed live...well, live as far as I'm concerned; it won't be broadcast until Monday on www.bbc.co.uk/radioscotland.

      I'm putting this online so my daughter can read it when I'm away...the idea is that Bicycle Boy becomes a book-length poem...we shall see! Updates will happen on this post, though I may move it out of the archives every month to keep it visible.  BICYCLE BOY  Jim didn’t plan to steal the bike It was just one of those things He was coming home from school And feeling mad Mrs Burns, his teacher Had made him stay on late To write out fifty times “I am not bad”  “I am bad” Jim said “Yes I am” “I’m evil through and through” “I don’t believe” his teacher said “That can possibly be true”  Mrs Burns was nearly nice And often almost fair So Jim decided not to be As horrid as he could He wrote “I am a nasty boy” and then “I murder frogs” Before writing “I am not bad” With his penknife In his blood   Mrs Burns bandaged him up And sent him on his way He didn’t see her crying As he left the school that day.  But if he had he’d just have laughed For Jim was kind of cruel And seeing people cry As something that he liked Mrs Burns had punished him For kicking Elsie Smith A girl bigger than Jimmy Who came to school by bike.  And it was Elsie’s bicycle Just sitting there unlocked Jim pedalled off the pavement And into a pick-up truck  It was doing 20 miles an hour Jim was maybe doing five And 25 combined you might not think Is very fast But Elsie’s bike was crushed beneath the wheels And Jim flew in the air And landed on a Volkswagen Passat     The noise was unbelievable An explosion, not a crash As if the street, the entire town Had been picked up and smashed   And then – just silence, for a while The trill of mobile phones And sirens somewhere, howling, hurt and sad The driver of the Volkswagen A man called called Ernest  Jones Had swallowed half his airbag That was bad.  “He’s dead” the ambulanceman said “He’s completely suffocated” Mr Jones was put into a bag And later was cremated  They didn’t have much hope  That Jim would have survived His legs were crushed and broken And his head all bashed and torn But a doctor gently touched his chest And felt something fluttering  Like a chick inside an egg Trying to be born  It was fast and careful work Drips and drugs, needles and splints Then they drove over the ambulance And gently put him in  The driver of the pick up truck Was really quite OK Jeanette Mactavish  Drove it to keep her children safe and sound “it’s four wheel drive” she kept on saying “very stable in the snow” And very safe when running cyclists down”  The ambulance drove Jim away The siren howled, the blue light flashed And Elsie Smith’s bike was left All broken, bent and smashed  The doctors at the hospital Spent hours working on Jim They drained and sewed and set And he breathed through a machine “at least he’s alive” they said “We’ll have to wait and see” and then his mother came to see him a woman name of Jean.  Jean Eaglesham – though Jim’s surname Was not the same as hers – was angry and frustrated “If he’s not awake, I’ll have to go – do you know  how long I’ve waited?  “I’ve work to do, people to see I run a shop in town For jokes and magic tricks there’s really Nowhere else to go I’ve had to shut it, turn folk away And money’s very tight I’m on my own, apart from Jim It’s not easy you know.”  A nurse took her aside, and said “I know That you’re distressed Jim’s in a coma, you’ve got to face that And do what you think is best  For him and you. Don’t run away There’s things you have to hear. The difference between someone who lives and just survives…” While in Jim’s room, he lay quite still Machines around him breathing  Was this being alive?   Well, was it? Jim was thinking Where am I? What’s going on? There was darkness all around And then it suddenly was gone.

      I met an old soothsayer she was looking very grave She said I fear our government No longer can be saved So many signs and portents too many to ignore Politicians looking nervous Journalists looking bored  And we are all terribly afraid For Alistair Darling’s eyebrows Are blacker than the ace of spades  How come his eyebrows are so dark When all his other hair’s so white It is a sign that he believes everything he says is...(something rhyming with 'right') Tony’s hair is getting thinner Gordon’s going grey But Alistair’s there in monchrome and now there’s a price to pay  the day of reckoning is come Judgement is drawing nigh the power of the evil eyebrow Can’t be overcome by dye Alistair must be dealt with Darling cannot trust to luck He’s going to have to get the treatment he’s going to have to get them plucked

      I don't remember childhood toilet seats becoming detached or unsteady. I remember those old black, white or avocado lavatorial attachments being solid, secure and everlasting. In my recent toiletry life, though, seats of pine, seats of oak, seats of expensive blue transparent plastic, have all begun to shift and slither on their mountings, no matter how carefully attached. The wing-nuts holding them on (and what an appropriate name) strip, the hinges rust and shatter.         I thought I'd solved the problem when I bought a solidly-constructed piece of bright pink toilet seatdom from Ikea. I mean, surely the Swedes would have sorted this kind of thing out? But no. within a week the screws had stripped and it was sliding about all over the place, not to mention threatening to thunder down when you were least expecting it to.         I may have found a solution which some may find extreme: Super epoxy glue. Slathering nuts, bolts and mounting plates in the stuff seems to have done the trick, despite the heavy duty use of the toilet by assorted buttocks. Long term is another matter. It's a real... bummer.

      I was gobsmacked when I checked out of the Malmaison to find I had been incredibly stupid to assume that the bottle of wine (well, 50 centilitres) supplied by the bed was free. £12.95, sonny. Not to mention £1.25 for a Coke and £1.75 for a Cadbury's Dairy Milk.       Next week the Premier Lodge (£35 a night) and a carry-in. Also, the Malmaison rooms could do with a clean and paint, not to mention new carpets.  Nice staff, though.         Can I just say that the new album from Mull Historical Society, ie Colin MacIntyre - This is Hope - may well be the greatest pop record ever produced by a Scot? Another listen and I'll go into more detail.

      This song is written from the point of view of a an innocent (fairly) Church of SCotland minister (male) determined to "save" a particularly attractive woman from the fires of hell (he thinks)  Shortly to be available on the album "Blind Boy Flugga's Big Huge Nippy Sweetie"  &nbsp; Presbyterian Bliss  &nbsp;  Mary had a ten grand Cartier watch  She kept it under her bed  It was a present from her late ex husband  Before he was dead  Ronnie was somewhat greasy  But he met a dreadful fate  Burned to death in a chip-pan fire  Which seemed appropriate  &nbsp;  Mary Mary I can offer you only this  Presbyterian bliss  &nbsp;  She used to smoke Marlboro Lights  Flicked the ash off with a snap  She said I know these things’ll kill me  But I don’t care about that.  She liked&nbsp; Seven Up and sulphate  The sound of taxis in the rain  Her favourite kind of holiday  Was having sex on aeroplanes  &nbsp;  Chorus  &nbsp;  Now that we are married all is well  For now that I have rescued her from hell  She fills me with the greatest exultation  She shares it with the congregation  &nbsp;  She likes Carlsberg Special  And cask strength whisky, neat  She wears Manolo Blahnik shoes  Upon her lovely feet  I took&nbsp; her to the church one day  So we could kneel and pray  She pleasured me upon a pew  I found I quite liked it that way  &nbsp;  Chorus&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;

      The strange thing about riding a motorcycle is the way your thought processes change...different memories and ideas spring to mind than if you're walking or driving or sitting staring into space.           I have no idea of the precise neurological reasons for this, but the necessity of concentration on riding - a physical and visual thing - somehow releases the dreaming capacity of the mind in unaccustomed directions. So yesterday, riding my eBay-acquired Kawasaki GTR1000 from Perth to Aberdeen through torrential rain, I was singing old gospel choruses to myself I hadn't thought of for decades ("down came the rain in torrents...and only eight were saved!")and weird songwriting ideas were arriving at speed.            I do find motorcycling intensely calming, which may seem bizarre to anyone who hasn't ridden a big powerful bike fast. There is a book called The Tao of the Ride which tries to explain all this in terms of eastern philosophy (yin, yang, the necessity for balance and precision). But I have a feeling it's because motorcycling involves, as I've said, an intensely physical experience of control which, while demanding your absolute concentration, also releases the brain to freewheel away in strange spirals.            Either that or my helmet's too tight.
