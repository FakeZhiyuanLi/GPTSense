      I have a fear of being alone. Not alone like in my room doing my homework alone, but the "without someone to create a life with" alone. But I'm going to fix this. I think it's the one thing about me that really hampers my happiness sometimes. I have such strong goals when it comes to relationships, but I have trouble saying no, or I get all fluttery because of the way someone looks at me or talks to me, and then I get sidetracked and think that a person is  the  person, when they aren't, and no matter what I do they will never be the person for me.   A year and a half ago, I was with someone who I loved very much... and I wanted my goals to come true with him. He made a very astute observation about me:    I could tell you were wishing for more... and that seems to be the root of your unhappiness.  you are unhappy with what you do not have instead of being happy with what you do have.  as i said, we take this one step at a time, enjoy each other (for what we have) and see what happens.  but you are getting ahead of the game and getting dissapointed in what has not happened, instead of glad for what has.   And it's true. I do still get disappointed in what has not happened... because in my mind I have ideas of what I'd like to have happen with the person I love; that in itself is not so bad. But when things don't go the way I was thinking they would and I get frustrated/upset,  that  is not good. And I still need a lot of work on that. I've had people leave me and it felt like something in side me was torn. And it would start to feel like it was healing, as I'd meet someone new, because I wouldn't focus on the pain anymore, I'd focus on the happiness of a new relationship. But I was never really healed, never truly whole. I'd go into relationships wounded, expecting the other person to heal me. Hoping the other person would heal me. But they couldn't. Only I can heal myself. And as my dad told me a week ago, it's not possible to have a truly successful and happy relationship until your own life is in control and  you are doing well on  your own. On my own.   But I crave affection sometimes. I love being hugged, held close. I love the feeling of curling up close beside someone and having them read to me, or say nothing at all. But I need to do without until my life is truly rolling in the career/financial direction I want it to go. Because it's really true that once you are happy and doing well and exuding happiness, that in itself will attract others. Don't let your world crumble down around you while you try to hang on to that one person because you believe they are more important than any other aspect of your life. I did that. And it almost cost me a lot. It almost cost me myself.

      Driving down to Oregon yesterday, I was thinking about people's emotions and being emotional and i realized i'm affected quite strongly by peoples emotion toward me, and how people are doing in general. however, i am totally niave sometimes when it comes to how people feel about me, how much they care about me...and that is to both extremes, thinking i'm just a friend when someone wants more, and thinking someone really cares about me and it attached to me when actually they feel pretty casual about me. so i think i'm pretty in-tune to other peoples emotions, but not when they're in reference to me.

      finding a passion  I have a passion. I am not going to be one of those people who just works for a living... I am going to help people. Help people lead happier, more causative lives. Help people with their studies, help people be drug-free... help people believe that it is actually POSSIBLE to live drug-free and be happy. No one needs to be dependent upon drugs to sleep, to be happy, to be stress-free. I feel so great about being who I am and believing what I believe right now.

      last night i went for a long walk. and a talk. a real talk. not the kind where i have to monitor what i say to make someone else happy. the kind with laughter. the kind where i can say what comes to mind without worrying about the consequences because there are none. because i was with a friend. and this friend eased some of the heaviness in my heart and in my head. what power a person can have, when they have the ability to be interested in what others say, not so they can counter it and spout off their own opinions before the other person has finished what the had to say, but because they care, and because the person they are listening to matters to them... matters enough that they can let the person verbally puke all over them if the must.  and we laughed. and joked about leaving nose prints on the windows of unsuspecting houses. but i chickened out. we tripped through trees till we found a park and then we played.  we were glad to have met each other and perhaps we'll keep in touch. we spoke of meeting again sometime. and this was supposed to be poetry but it isn't. oh well. no one's reading it anyway, right? ;)

      New and Improved! how the hell can something be both new and improved?     From one insomniac to another    It helps to have someone to talk to who can make the hours disappear  Sometimes I think I have that, but it’s just my guinea pig, looking for carrots  And take comfort that the demons in your head haven’t mated  With the demons in your heart, as mine have   Long walks looking up can help, too  ________________________  when love gets in the way  -or-  call to a missing   drawn back time and again  such a high as friends  went wrong under a swinging cross

      He brought me suns yesterday to brighten my day. We stayed up until 3:30 a.m. twinkling, reading poetry and absorbing each other.  skin under skin rhythmic invasion creeping to my surface long after you are gone  oozing out my feet as I dance down the halls  clambering along my spine as I weave to  the sounds of life

      I found my inspiration, and finally found the time to write about it. I'm a lucky star to my inspiration.  When I look into his eyes, I've been here before, known him before... we fit. We belong. Me and my inspiration...  you asked me "where have you been all this time?"  i smiled, blushed, and looked away but skin touches melted fear one look untied a heart of knots you smiled, i found a part of me long lost  and then i knew--  all this time i've been searching for you

       A plea, decapitation, and payment   A man approached me today as I sat in my car across from the library and assailed me with sounds:    Are you from here I've lived here for 57 years please believe me I swear to God I got to work today and forgot my wallet I just need five dollars to get gas so I can get home 57 granville I'll be back within the hour I swear to God no one will listen or stop unbelievable where will you be I'll bring the money back to you.    When he walked away, his pockets were filled with my parking change.   Later, I passed a window display of tux-clad mannequins. The stumps of their necks were scarlet. Silk to match the hankerchiefs in their breast pockets.   I paid a visit to Gootanks today. He owed me $111.28 and wanted me to come back on May 6th for it. I told him I start working full-time tomorrow and I only do this job two days a month. I said he could pay me the next time I did my rounds. He knocked my words out of the air and threw some bills down on the counter. He asked me to sign the invoice to show it was paid and after I complied he ripped it in half and threw it in the garbage.   "You gaze back at me and I don't know where you are Though you're utterly there"    urlLink The voice of a true poet   I think I'll go buy Mr. Bechta's book. It's not up to anyone but ourselves to make us happy. My quest begins anew.

      Hermaphrodite angels   "I wrote my first book for myself. I wrote it so I'd have something I could pick up when I was feeling a little blue, and it would help me feel better....  "I used to write poetry that people couldn't connect to, for example, poetry about hermaphrodite angels. Then one day I started writing poetry that made me feel good, and those who read it were able to connect to it, to feel the same emotion in them."   That's just a small portion of a conversation I had today with Mr. Bechta while making my map rounds. We also discussed love. And what a complicated idea that is. He is of the opinion that one cannot feel love from another person; all the love we feel is our love for ourselves. I'm still wrapping my head around that one. When others express love for us, and we feel we are experiencing love, is that then just a reflection of the love we feel for ourselves? What about the love we feel for others?   I'm going to take his advice about writing to feel good. A lot of what I write is to heal, but it often ends up jarring or hurting other people. But I've always felt that what I write  needs  to be written. What a deprickament.

      What a weekend it's been! Friday night was spent watching the first bit of  Waking Life . I think I could watch that movie a hundred times and still new ideas would strike me that I missed before. It would probably be easiest to just study the script!  Employment is going marvelously well, although I can feel myself getting a little overwhelmed again at all the research I need to do.   Just keep swimming... just keep swimming...  The most recent poem I wrote was written during a conference of writing centres in Centralia. It's not nearly done, but it's a good sample of the darker sides of inspiration.   Credible, tangible, horrid Know the frustration of it Spinning wheels on pavement glazed with rain  Carrying one from another and back again?  Backroads let us find our own way  Meet a ____-then squash him like a bloated maggot, so full of his own intelligence and testosterone that he rapes without guilt and feels wronged when he's left behind  Stick to the highway, old man Drugs will be your only comfort as you speed towards inevitable self-destruction

      Philosophy:  " The first principle of my own philosophy is that wisdom is meant for anyone who wishes to reach for it.... The second principle of my own philosophy is that it must be capable of being applied.  Learning locked in mildewed books is of little use to anyone and therefore of no value unless it can be used.... The third principle is that any philosophic knowledge is only valuable if it is true or works. These three principles are so strange to the field of philosophy that I have given my philosophy a name: SCIENTOLOGY. This means only 'knowing how to know.' A philosophy can only be a  route  to knowledge. It cannot be crammed down one's throat. If one has a route, he can then find what is true for him. And that is Scientology.  Know thyself...and the truth shall set you free."   -LRH  I spent nine years avoiding Scientology. My reason? It was my parents' religion, not mine. I wanted to find my own path, my own truths, my own beliefs.   So I searched, I read, I talked to others... I met hicks, druggies, criminals, businessmen, artists, and poets. And through all I was learning, I still found myself using little bits and pieces of data that I'd gained from Scientology when I was younger. For example,   the Scientology Code of Honor:  1. Never desert a comrade in need, in danger or in trouble.   2. Never withdraw allegiance once granted.   3. Never desert a group to which you owe your support.   4. Never disparage yourself or minimize your strength or power.   5. Never need praise, approval or sympathy.   6. Never compromise with your own reality.   7. Never permit your affinity to be alloyed.   8. Do not give or receive communication unless you yourself desire it.   9. Your self-determinism and your honor are more important than your immediate life.   10. Your integrity to yourself is more important than your body.   11. Never regret yesterday. Life is in you today, and you make your tomorrow.   12. Never fear to hurt another in a just cause.   13. Don’t desire to be liked or admired.   14. Be your own adviser, keep your own counsel and select your own decisions.   15. Be true to your own goals  I had wrapped myself up with a boy who felt that, in order for me to be a "safe" person to live with, he needed me to renounce all connection to Scientology. This meant he didn't want me using or quoting the little bits and pieces that I'd already found to be true for me. Well, those little bits are part of who I am. So, #6 came into play, and we went our separate ways.   It's now been almost two years since that learning experience, and when times get rough and I feel lost, hopeless, or just plain confused, the truths I gained from Scientology are there for me.   Now I'm taking steps so I will no longer feel lost, hopeless and confused; I am active in the Church again, and becoming more ME with each passing day.

      "What is true is what is true for you." -LRH  It's amazing how many people, in their search for answers, spend their lives quoting others. I recently talked to a fellow who wanted to know where he could find out about Scientology. So I said, "Go into a Church. Ask questions." It seemed fairly simple to me. If I'm curious about Roman Catholicism (which is what my boyfriend's family practices), I'm going to ask someone who IS a Roman Catholic, who studies it, practices it, believes in it and, ideally, has benefited from it. So, if someone comes up to me with a bunch of negative claims about Scientology and has never actually walked into a Church, or taken part in any of the services on their own determinism, and furthermore isn't willing to, then I have trouble believing they are looking for the truth.  Why are some so quick to believe the bad news? Maybe because it's everywhere, and virtually inescapable. Just watch the news, eh? And I suppose its easier than taking the time to go to the source of this or that subject and learning about it for oneself.   Two weeks ago, I took a personality test at the Church (in downtown Vancouver). I got my results last night, all charted out. The lowest points on it were labelled "nervous" and "irresponsible". And I thought "waaaaaaaait a minute! I'm responsible...look at all the responsibilities I have." I write a newsletter for  urlLink CCHR , I'm working at a school, I'm starting up a tutoring business, and a manuscript evaluation service with a classmate of mine, I have a boyfriend, I stay in touch with my family fairly well, and I have all these other things always on the go: my poetry, etc. But then I remembered that I've recently been feeling like a ping pong ball in a small box, boinging around but never actually getting anywhere. Then I thought about it, and realized that, yeah, I have a lot of responsibilities, but I've not actually carried anything through from start to finish. And with being nervous, I am nervous. I don't feel comfortable if I think people are watching me, especially guys, and I often wonder if people who are around me are thinking this or that of me because something I've said or done. So these are two areas I'll be working on improving. It was quite a mind-blowing night, finally realizing more about myself.   And, Tom and I are going to do both a communication course (to increase our level of confront and our communication) and a personal efficiency course, after I finish my improving relationships with others course.   Finally, this Saturday is the grand-opening of the Volunteer Minister's tent in front of the Vancouver art gallery. And we are going to that. It's going to be pretty exciting!   Speaking of Tom, he just arrived. Time to snuggle in for a good night's sleep.

      Thank you, ZeD!  I'm writing again. I'm home.   I had an informal job interview today, and I have a very successful businessman backing me 100% in starting up a tutoring business. I'm rollin'! And I'm so fired up I can't sit still!   To get what you want is simple, really. Just figure out what you want, decide that you are going get there, and then work out how to do it. Once the decision has been made, figuring out how to get there is a LOT easier! I have 3 jobs I love on the go because I made a few strong decisions.

       Make it go right, that is the way. Make it go right and win the day.  -lyrics from a song I believe was written by LRH  Another fantabulous day!  It's time for me to study up on construction and roofing.  Why?  Because I got hired by Kerr Construction and Absolute Roofing Solutions to write marketing material!!! I'm going to be looking for unique aspects of what they do and how they do it, projects they've finished, etc., and find angles and create stories to pitch to magazines and newspapers. So I could get published, too! He'll pay me by the hour and I get a bonus when I get published!  And of course I took the job that Peter Paulus offered me!   Woo hoo!  Plus, Tomek has realized he wants to do work he loves, so he is going to become a translator (he's fluent in Polish, Spanish and English and speaks some French and Italian too)!  We are rolling along in our own lives and together, and that is just how it should be.

       People who are unable to motivate themselves must be content with mediocrity, no matter how impressive their other talents. -Andrew S. Carnegie   No time to write, only time to paste an e-mail I found waiting for me when I got home today!  Dear Krista, It was lovely meeting you the other day and I enjoyed our communication. I have a proposal to make to you and wanted to see if this is something you could or would consider. On the week of June 7th to 10th, I am planning to go to the United States on business. I would require someone like yourself to tutor a student named Conor 2hrs a day Monday to Friday on English 11 Essay writing and composition for the week from 12:30 to 1:30 pm and then 3:30 to 4:30pm each day. In between and perhaps after that time, I would like you to spend time in the office handling administration, stats, telephone answering, scheduling and so on.  If you could come in next week for a few days or evenings and work with me, I'll teach you the ropes and you can learn the basics of my essay writing techniques and my successful administration patterns first hand so you can apply them to your own future operation. I would pay you for the English Tutorials of course but I would like to exchange my valuable data for a couple hours or less per evening of administration for the 4 days I am gone. There may be a couple of other students you could tutor that week as well. It would only be for the one week but much could be achieved and I will find out your skills level and be certainly inclined to hire you in the future. I hope you accept my proposal. What do you think? Peter  Now I must dash to deliver maps, finish my course, and spend time with friends at the Trap and Gill!

       The bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them, glory and danger alike, and yet notwithstanding, go out to meet it.  -Thucydides   Another phenomenal BEA meeting!   These BEA meetings, run by local  urlLink WISE  members, are so great. Tonight I worked more on my administrative scale, which is a simple formula for lining up what you want and what you need to do to get there. The time went by so quickly. Each night, I get one-on-one help from Rob Spick, who is highly trained in management, ethics and justice tech. And there's nothing like being surrounded by successful businessmen to give me the boost of confidence that YES I can create my own busines and live as comfortably as I want to, do as well as I want to and produce as much as I want to! And I think just by showing up they take me seriously as a businesswoman who is starting up her own company. It's an incredible feeling!  And that's not even my most exciting news of the past couple days! Yesterday evening I went and met Peter Paulus (finally), the director of Westcoast Tutoring. We met for 2 1/2 hours and discussed his tutoring practice (he's been doing this for over 20 years), he answered a ton of my questions on diagnostic testing and pin-pointing exactly where the student is having trouble. He also let me sit in on a tutoring session, in which he tutored a ten-year-old boy, and it was great! I saw how he slowly drew the kid out of his shell and got him more involved and interested in the session as the time went on. And that kid was BRIGHT! I couldn't believe how quickly he was catching on to what Peter was showing him. At the end of the meeting I left my resume *patting me on the back* and Peter said "Oh, so you think you might like to work for me?" I said "I'd love to work for you." And he said he'd keep that well in mind. He also said that anything he could do to help me would be of interest to him as well. There's just so much goodwill out there IN the business world... I just had to find it. And I did! And I'm rolling along and learning so much from these kind, successful people.   Now I just need to keep stopping by his tutoring centre, which he's more than happy to have me do, and keep doing that and casually bring up working for him, and then I'll definitely get a job! I know I can. :)  Plus, I talked to Doug this afternoon at the BEA meeting about writing about his company and he's excited to get started on that right away, so we're going to meet Saturday afternoon at his office to go over what exactly his company does and what their management practices are, which will be a whole other learning experience for me!   Wow!

       Ah, if you could dance all that you've just said, then I'd understand.  -Nikos Kazantzakis  I went dancing on Saturday night at the Stone Temple. What a great way to unwind (and get some exercise) after a week of work! I was nervous and thought I wouldn't have the courage to get out there and move with other people, but I did!   In the swirl of lights, bodies and bass, I felt beautiful.

       Each of us has a fire in our hearts for something. It's our goal in life to find it and to keep it lit.  -Mary Lou Retton     Print Futures takes over the Editors' Association of Canada!   On May 19, five Print Futures students joined the Executive Committee of the BC branch of the EAC. They are:  Barb Adamski: Membership Kelly Parry: Newsletter Theresa Laviolette: Newsletter Wendy Harris: Professional Development Krista Zundel: Public Relations  Congratulations to us all!  So many great things happened to me this week. First, I got my first pay cheque from  urlLink Heritage . Hooray!  Plus, I have a job interview, tentatively set for May 25, with  urlLink West Coast Tutoring ! If all goes well, which I'm sure it will, I'll be doing contract tutoring for them on weekday evenings.   Tom and I went on course last night at the Church. I'm almost done my course, and he just started the  Personal Efficiency  course. I finally found an answer to why Rob went so weird after we were engaged. It's so great to finally know!  Oh! And we were at graduation before course started, and after graduation, Doug Kerr came up to me (he's on the Board of Directors of Heritage, and the gentleman who helped get all this stuff with tutoring rolling) and asked me if I'd be interested in writing some articles about his company and their business procedure for local papers. Of course I am! And he said he'd pay me nicely, of course.   I finally talked to my mom, after way too long, and she told me that the Learning Centre she helped start up in McMinnville needs promo material (flyers and a brochure to start). So when I go down at the beginning of June, I'll be doing that work for them!!  Oh, and Tom was telling me more about his family's escape from Poland... and I've decided his story would make a great book! More ideas on this to come!  Too many exclamation marks in this post, but who cares? Life is great and I'm lovin' it!!

       If you stand straight, do not fear a crooked shadow. -Chinese proverb  Opinions about me flying around do just that: fly around…   What I write here is truths about myself. My integrity is what I value most in my life, and witnessing others portray me in untruthful fashions is unacceptable.  The pieces of writing that have been the subject of so much key-tapping are a long feature, and two poems.   Fact: No names, dates, or physical locations were given in the long feature, or in the poems.  Fact: I did not bypass an instructor before having my long feature distributed to classmates.   Fact: My long feature and poetry have been read by many others, all who have given positive, supportive feedback. In particular, they have seen my long feature as something that needs to be shared and voiced.  Fact: A respected, male seniority spent about 15 minutes reading my long feature at my graduating class’ portfolio show, and commented that he liked the story-telling approach I take in my writing.  Fact: I highly value honesty and integrity in writing, and am and have been vigilant in keeping my writing from being deceptive.   Fact: I have never taken and will never take mind- or behaviour-altering psychiatric drugs, such as anti-depressants.  Fact: I posted a motto “I write the ugly words” on a site where I also post some of my writing. There are a lot of ugly activities going on in the world: rape, the rampant labeling of man with “mental disorders” and the equally rampant drugging of young children with suppressive, addictive, psychiatric drugs.  I have strong opinions about each of these issues, and, in order to educate, it is necessary to write ugly words. I do not, however, let the ugly words rest alone. I follow up and overshadow them with solutions, alternatives, aids and help to people who are or have been negatively impacted by these issues. I write ugly words because there are times when they need to be written. They need to be shown to people in all their atrociousness; this alone will raise awareness, decrease tolerance and successfully bring about change that will benefit mankind.   Fact: Before moving to BC, I lived in Oregon and Toronto, as well as East Grinstead, England. I have met and associated with many people, and have known more than 1 or 2 men. I have had pleasant and unpleasant experiences throughout my time in these places, and, although some may deem me “only” 23 years old, I have had the good fortune to be raised in a manner that let me think and choose for myself, thereby finding, at the age of 18, my passions, which I have pursued in the form of a career. It is my intent to aid in freeing mankind from the suppression and evil that holds us back. That may sound like a lofty goal, but it is my goal, my passion, and no one can take that away from me. Furthermore, I believe I will succeed just as strongly as I believe in my reasons for needed to succeed.   Fact: Prior to graduating from a two-year writing program, I held a part-time job (two in my final semester), and secured a full-time job in a private school where I now work one-on-one with children, helping them discover that they can learn and understand anything they want; nothing is beyond their grasp. In this, I can already see that this will help them maintain who they truly are. I currently hold this full-time job, as well as a part-time job as a sale representative. Additionally, with the help of weekly meetings with the Business Expansion Association, I am partnering with one fellow in a tutoring business, where my long-term goal is to help all persons learn that they can be as successful as they want, by aiding them in improving their writing, reading and study skills. I am also pursuing contract tutoring work at a local, very successful tutoring service to aid in furthering my own business. As well, I have started a manuscript evaluation service with a fellow classmate of mine. (http://silverink.4t.com) And I continue to write… the “ugly” words, and also inspirational words, thanks to my rediscovery of Scientology.    Here are what some active, working professional writers have had to say about me:   “This is just awesome. Your article is going to continue to impact women who need to hear a brave, intelligent, and articulate voice speak out. Well done.”  *	*	*  “I am really glad that you could turn your experience into an empowering one. I found your story really well written and powerful. See, what I mean about being a strong person. I also want to thank you for letting me share in your life experience. I feel really honoured to be a part of it and to witness your growth.”  *	*	*  “I'm so proud of you. What an incredible piece of work. I think you did a great job of balancing your emotions with research and reason. You should be very proud of yourself. I wish I had your courage, at your age, to have been able to deal with my _________ when it happened to me.  You know, the most important thing you can do is validate that this happened to you. It will save your soul from much suffering and pain rather than stuffing it down like I did for so many years. It's an exercise in self worth and self respect. Even if the other person never realizes the pain they have caused, the very fact that you have let yourself "feel and heal" will make you stronger than you ever thought you could be.”  *	*	*

        THE JOY OF CREATING   Force yourself to smile and you’ll soon stop frowning.   Force yourself to laugh and you’ll soon find  something to laugh about.   Wax enthusiastic and you’ll very soon feel so.   A being causes his own feelings.   The greatest joy there is in life is creating.   Splurge on it!  -LRH

      "The only way you can really postulate any kind of a goal at all is imagination. And if you don't postulate high-flown goals--if you don't hitch your wagon to a star--it's a cinch you are not going to get up to the top of the pine tree, because it takes  that much  to get  this  much. You know, in  Alice in Wonderland  it says you have to run just to keep up. You have to run  twice  as fast if you want to get anyplace."   L. Ron Hubbard   How true it is. Time and again, I'm blown away by these bits and pieces of LRH tech I read, these pieces that tell me exactly what to do to be more productive, do better, and be happier in so many parts of my life.   I've started attending Business Expansion Association meetings, which use LRH tech on management and business to help business owners make their businesses be all they can be... and more! So not only am I gaining valuable tools for creating a successful business (well, two actually), I'm also meeting other independent businessmen who have invaluable experience and wins to share. Those hour and a half meetings on Thursday nights are phenomenal!

      Busy busy busy. But taking time out to post the lyrics to an incredibly inspirational song I heard on the radio, by Trooper. Now  these  are words to live by:   Raise a little Hell, raise a little Hell, raise a little Hell  Raise a little Hell, raise a little Hell, raise a little Hell  Raise a little Hell, raise a little Hell, raise a little Hell   If you don't like  What you got  Why don't you change it  If your world is all screwed up  Rearrange it  Raise a little Hell ...  If you don't like what you see  Why don't you fight it  If you know there's something wrong  Why don't you right it  Raise a little Hell ...  In the end it comes down to your thinking  And there's really nobody to blame  When it feels like your ship is sinking  And you're too tired to play the game  Nobody's going to help you  You've just got to stand up alone  And dig in your heels  And see how it feels  To raise a little Hell of your own  Raise a little Hell ...  If you don't like  What you got  Why don't you change it  If your world is all screwed up  Rearrange it  Raise a little Hell ...

       You are the only one who can use your ability. It is an awesome responsibility.  -Zig Ziglar   Today I feel like a freelancer. I rolled out of bed at 10 a.m., prepared some interview questions for a phone interview at 11, checked my email, wrote a list of what I need to do today, and then called my interviewee.   The interview only took 20 minutes; I asked five questions and typed two pages of notes on my interviewee's responses. Thank goodness for hands-free telephone thingamabobs!  Now I have the gruesome job of editing my splatter of keystrokes. Here's a sampling:   Fiding what clinest need and having some knf of system to enure it gets doen properly. Internal quality control of check and balances. Homeoenw er diesn’t know how to do that, typeically doent like to go up on roof Need someone within the company whose job it is to ensure quality and check detail.    When I finished, my interviewee commented that my questions were good! Hooray!  Then I'll get to sit down and compose a story. My client wants me to send it out everywhere, but I remember the possible downfalls of doing this. I'll have to brush up on what exactly can happen and then let him know. I am the professional after all!  Tomek and I went on course last night after almost two weeks of not having time to go. I learned about the Conditions of Existence, which are as follows:  Be, Do and Have   "The game of life demands that one assume a beingness in order to accomplish a doingness in the direction of havingness."  "The ability to be is more important than the ability to do. The ability to do is more important than the abililty to have."    (Which fits nicely with the idea that one of the highest of human virtues is the ability to permit others to have beingness.)   "When one has clarified the idea of possession or havingness, one can then proceed to clarify doingness for general activity, and when this is done, one understands beingness or identity."   Quotes taken from  The Basic Scientology Picture Book  by L. Ron Hubbard.  Basically, I know what I want. Knowing that, I need to figure out what I need to do to accomplish that. Then I need to figure out what I need to be in order to do those actions successfully. Then I get busy and be, do and have!  On a more somber note, I just received a big legal-sized envelope from Applied Scholastics Canada... licensing info. Ugh. The papers started out friendly enough, a letter from the head of APS Canada basically supporting my initiative to have a tutoring centre here, and letting me know to contact her if I have any questions about filling out the documents that were included with the letter. Then came an "Application for authorization to use the Applied Scholastics trademarks" and another legal-sized form on "How to apply to open a social betterment group or activity". Lastly, on letter-sized paper, a licese agreement, guaranteed to be written in lawyer-speak. Ugh! These three documents total 24 pages that I have to read and understand and fill out as quickly as possible. EEK! Luckily I have a BEA meeting tonight, so Rob can help me with these, I hope.  In the mail today I also received my pictures from when I walked across the stage at the Douglas College graduation ceremony. Not bad, not bad at all. :)

       All who have accomplished great things have had a great aim, have fixed their gaze on a goal which was high, one which sometimes seemed impossible.  -Orison Swett Marden  Seemed impossible... yes, sometimes my goals, when I try to look at them from an outsider's perspective, do seem impossible. But when I look at them from my perspective, knowing myself and my beliefs and those who are supporting me, they don't seem impossible at all.   Already I have so many people pushing for me to go to the  urlLink Applied Scholastics Convention  in St. Louis in the middle of July. I do want to go, but while I am working a lot, I haven't exactly had time to save yet. So maybe I'll just have to wait and go next year. As much as I do want to do all these different things, and as much as I have support and knowledgeable people who are helping me, I can only do so much without burning myself out. I don't like putting any limitations on myself, and I guess I'm not; I'm just realizing I need to concentrate on three or four things at once instead of eight. I guess that's a bit of an improvement!  I meant for this to be longer, but I kept getting side-tracked and now I need to finish making my stir-fry so I can go snuggle in bed with my sweetie.

      Good things come to those who get their butts in gear!  Finally, I'm back involved with  urlLink CCHR . Julie, who I interviewed way back when for a class assignment, and who is the current Director of CCHR Vancouver, is back from Florida for a few weeks and is looking for a new Director of the BC Chapter... do I want this position?  YES!!  I've been saying over and over "Education and human rights are the areas I'm looking to get involved with". My tutoring centre has got education covered, and it looks like this could be my contribution to human rights!  Even better, Thatcher, my red-head friend from Toronto, moved to Vancouver recently, and he's involved in CCHR as a volunteer, too!  Surround yourself with good people and good things will happen. (I've seen the flip-side of that, too, blathering idiots and those oozing insanity, and I much prefer associating with the groups I'm in now!)  Now I must dash off to an event: the Director of CCHR UK is speaking downtown tonight, and she's been in the field for over 20 years. Not only that, she's a Lady!   Da da da life is grand!

       Genuine love will always feel urged to communicate joy--to be a joy-giver. Mankind needs joy.  -Lawrence G. Lovasik   I've been tutoring a grade eleven student in English and Social Studies, and we've been working on a research paper. The first rough draft he wrote was more of an opinion piece, so I had to get him to see that he needed to turn it into more of a research, and how he could do that. It was so great to realize that I have the ability to do that! I didn't come right out and say it, because things always stick in my head longer if I learn them or figure them out for myself. So he started rewriting after doing some research and a lot of talking with me, and he's turning out what has the makings of a great research paper!  I've been attending these Business Expansion Association meetings for almost two months now, and every week I get a program of homework to have done for the following week so that I'm progressing on building my tutoring centre. I've been feeling blocked on what to do and how to do it, but yesterday, while tutoring, the floodgates opened and I was scribbling down ideas as quickly as I could. And the more I started writing out and picturing what I wanted, the more excited I became! I can do this, and I will! Not only that, I will also be successful!  By the way, here's the lowdown on the  urlLink Adminstrative Scale  I've been writing about.  I attended the first meeting of EAC Executives last night and networking was unavoidable because I only knew six people out of the twenty or so that were there. I met the out-going public relations chair (I'm the incoming one), and it turns out he works for an online marketing company and had tons to say about why internet marketing is the way to go. I'll definitely be keeping in touch with him!  Lastly, on my program from BEA this week, one of the points was to make a list of potential people who could tutor for me so I can talk to them and have them ready for when we get enough students to hire more tutors... and Carla from Print Futures came up to me at the EAC Exec meeting and was interested!! I didn't even realize it was on my program till after I'd talked to her! She also worked at the Douglas College Learning Centre for a few years, and she said to feel free to contact her if I had any questions or curiosities or needed any hints or tips.  I'm feeling pretty phenomenal!

      So much is going on that I'm happy to say I no longer suffer from insomnia! I suffer from "ihavetogetupalready?".  I spent last week running Peter Paulus' tutoring centre in West Van. It was definitely a learning experience, running the office, keeping tutors schedules up-to-date and straight, handling parents who called in with messed up schedules, and, of course, tutoring. I got a great taste for what it will be like to run my own, and just how much will be going on all at once. I'm looking forward to it!  Shopping for a place to rent has begun already! And I have my first student. She's in sixth grade, and wants tutoring in math, reading, writing and she's also going to take a Study Tech course. I'll start tutoring her this Saturday, and then I'll dash off to a large Polish wedding. It's rumoured that, unless the wedding is "Canadianized", the reception will run all evening and into Sunday morning.   I finished my course at the Church on Friday night, and I was totally blown out by the last article I read. It covered the two rules for happy living:   1. Be able to experience anything.  2. Cause only those things which others are able to experience easily.   Sounds simple, but it's not! I realized how much I don't follow number 2, especially in spoken communication. But now that I've had that realization, it's something I'm going to keep working on. And  that  is the great thing about Scientology: I've realized so much about myself, things that are good, and things that need to change. Not only does it show me what needs to be changed, it's simply outlined how I could change it.    A little beauty is preferable to much wealth.  -Sa'di

       I'm back at my high school in Oregon for the year-ending festivities. Meeting up with a lot of people I haven't seen in a few years...    Yea, I can see it now The distant red neon shivered in the heat I was feeling like a stranger in a strange land You know where people play games with the night God, it was too hot to sleep I followed the sound of a jukebox coming from a levee All of a sudden I could hear somebody whistling Fromright behind me I turned around and she said "Why do you always end up down at Nick's Cafe?" I said "I don't know, the wind just kind of pushed me this way." She said "Hang the rich."  Catch the blue train   To places never been before Look for me   Somewhere down the crazy river   Somewhere down the crazy river Catch the blue train   All the way to Kokomo You can find me   Somewhere down the crazy river   Somewhere down the crazy river  Take a picture of this The fields are empty, abandoned '59 Chevy Laying in the back seat listening to Little Willie John Yea, that's when time stood still You know, I think I'm gonna go down to Madam X And let her read my mind She said "That Voodoo stuff don't do nothing for me."  I'm a man with a clear destination I'm a man with a broad imagination You fog the mind, you stir the soul I can't find, ... no control  Catch the blue train   To places never been before Look for me   Somewhere down the crazy river   Somewhere down the crazy river Catch the blue train   All the way to Kokomo You can find me   Somewhere down the crazy river   Somewhere down the crazy river  Wait, did you hear that  Oh this is sure stirring up some ghosts for me She said "There's one thing you've got to learn Is not to be afraid of it." I said "No, I like it, I like it, it's good." She said "You like it now But you'll learn to love is later."  I been spellbound - falling in trances I been spellbound - falling in trances You give me shivers - chills and fever I been spellbound - somewhere down the crazy river   -Robbie Robertson

       Great things are accomplished by talented people who believe they will accomplish them.  -Warren Bennis  More and more good things happening to me.  Yesterday I was at Westcoast Tutoring for hatting (training). I learned that I may be helping a seven-year-old girl to read. What a thought! I studied the phonics materials Peter has there, and I had the most phenomenal realization!   I've been wanting to learn German, and now Polish. Tomek and I have this dream of going to Europe once we are both comfortable in our respective professions (tutor and translator). It would be fairly easy for me to get a European citizenship since my father is German and I could, potentially, be married to someone who is Polish. I had concern on learning languages, especially since my French is so abysmal even though I took it in grade school and high school.   Reading over the phonics checksheets, however, and seeing how the learning process is laid out, learning English by learning the sounds of the individual letters first, then stringing the sounds together to learn words, clearing the definitions of the words as one goes.... I realized I can learn Polish, and possibly German that way, too!!  And then, even more exciting, I was at Westcoast Tutoring again today tutoring and getting more hatting, and Peter came in and sat down across from me and told me he wants to hire me. He wants me to work  with  him, not just for him. He wants me to be more than a tutor. I would be his assistant, his second-in-command, learning all the ropes and tutoring as well, and through being there, learn how to run one and then open one of my own!! I said we could be "sister centres", and work together to expand our tutoring services throughout the Lower Mainland and get  urlLink Study Technology  more widely known and used! (Which will definitely be of much benefit to all the kids who are having to slog through the public school system.)  Tomorrow is my class' graduation, and my family is coming up to see it. Then I'll be down in Oregon for four days going to the end-of-the-year festivities at  urlLink Delphi  and putting together marketing materials for my mom's learning centre. As well, I have to read The Crucible this weekend so I can tutor a kid on it next week, studying plot, character sketches, themes, etc. I'm going to learn so much!!

       All better now, I think   Okay so I was the one who broke down and called first. I don't have the energy to hold out in a "who can be silent longer" contest. I think I've outgrown those.. and I sucked at them anyway.  So I was bitchy and stressed and stormed off and from what I can see, he just shrugged and said "F*ck it" because he didn't have the energy to go after me. So we talked for about 45 minutes today, his lack of concern about the whole thing surprised me, but maybe it's just me being female worrying about it all. He said he was going to wait a while before calling me... a while being around a week. (!?!?!?!?!?) Soooo... yeah, I broke the silence and we're okay for now. Better, I hope, than duct tape on a screen door. There's my Yankee analogy for the year.  We are meeting up in a little under 2 hours to go see the fireworks. Hooray!  Back to packing.

       It's settled   I'm moving this weekend. I finalized things with my present and soon-to-be landlords. I was supposed to go in to the Church and study today, but instead I need to start packing my stuff up. I figure I'll spend today packing and organizing, and tomorrow morning maybe I'll move. I'm not quite sure how I'm going to move my furniture yet, but there's always a way. I was hoping my current would help me, but given the recent events, we may not see each other this weekend. So then my only other alternative is one of my exes who has a truck. But my current wouldn't want my past helping... and I can understand that.  There's really no reason for my current to help, given all that went on last night. I don't think he's much in favour of me moving to where I'm moving to anyway. If I do move tomorrow, I'll definitely want to get an early start because of the heat. Plus I have to be at the Quay in New West by 4:45 for the exhibit.  Blah blah blah... it's past 2:30 and I haven't even really done anything in my room. But I did do dishes and got two loads of laundry on the go!  Ooohhh.... fireworks tonight on English Bay starting at 10 p.m.  I wonder who will break the silence first? I'm guessing I should wait for him because I'm the one that pissed him off. So when he feels like talking to me he will; or maybe he won't. I don't know. We've never really had a fight like this before. But I think I showed last night that I am always willing to try to make things right (I drove out to apologize...). This time I'm not sure exactly what I should apologize for. For being a stunned, stressed out bitch? Maybe.

       I think I'm gonna...   Good Smackerday morning. The sun is out, I finally unearthed myself from the mountain of blankets I sleep under despite the summer heat. Don't ask. I don't understand it myself.  Last night I checked out a place to move to. In all craziness, I could move in this weekend. But should I?  The place I found is a two-bedroom basement suite. So it's got two bedrooms, a living room area connected to a kitchen space and a full bathroom (with bathtub, oh joy!). I'd be paying the same that I'm paying now, including phone, laundry and cable. And if I kept searching for another place closer to the area I really want to live in, and find a place, this landlord would be okay with me giving my notice rather suddenly. The house is a little run-down, and I would have the pitter-patter of feet above my head again (this would be the fourth basement suite I've lived in since moving back to Canada in 2001). Yeah, come to think of it, there probably isn't a lot of noise-blockage.... but... but... I'd have  my own space ! The laundry is upstairs and so the only reason the landlord would have to come down would be if a fuse blew. I'd have my own kitchen, and so much room! Two rooms! I could have a bedroom, an office, and the living room area to chill out in! Oh oh! And my own fridge! (Had I mentioned before that I share a fridge with Mooney? I have two half-shelves and two crisper drawers... and one item in the freezer. The rest is his, and the fridge is constantly packed full. There's salmon in the freezer that looks older than I am!)  Okay, I can't stand reading long blocks of text, especially online. So I won't put you through that either! I got myself pretty excited up there...  I think sound is going to travel a lot through the main floor of that house. And the house is old, and the ceiling is pretty low--but it's got a fresh, white paint job and is pretty bright in the day time (lots of windows) and even so at night with the lights on. I think that while it is a little run down, it could be a snug little den for me. And I'm pretty small, so I didn't even notice the low ceilings. And I can have baths again.... and shower in space that is bigger than two feet by two feet!  I guess I'll start cleaning my room and packing.

       ...   So right after I post that last picture I remember, he and his co-workers are going out for beers to celebrate one of their birthdays. This is just like another Friday night, maybe it will culminate again to him drinking and driving even after I ask him not to.  One beer, that's all they say  Eight beers later cars driven off shlowly... or shpeed  one beer, one puff, who cares? one puff, one high, no worries   as the bite in his voice and the distance in his eyes slowly breaks me down  I can't get this into a poem yet. Why don't people see that when they are high they change in front of those who aren't high. Sure they can be goofy and funny, but really, all I see is edginess and a flat, dull look in his eyes.  What a fantabulous Friday night. Think I'm going to go out for a girls night.  There ya go, the whole gamut of my life, my work, my poetry and everything inbetween.  Enjoy.

       Not again!    &nbsp; Helping Tomek out last night had me up till about 3 a.m. and then I couldn't sleep. I hate that. Am I the only one who gets over-tired and then can't sleep?  When I finally picked myself up off the floor this morning, I staggered to my upstairs bathroom and glanced down the stairs. It was nearly noon, and who do you think was downstairs in the kitchen making coffee  with no pants on ?  Unbelievable. He rents one room in one house for four years and he thinks he can take it over by walking around like that, blaring his music so the whole house shakes, and then stinking up the entire house everytime his bedroom door opens.   I should complain; but my landlady has already resigned herself to the fact that there is no way she could ever evict him. How causative.

       Moving out ASAP    I gave my notice a couple of days ago, but I hope to find a place that's available August 1st. That way, people who don't live here anymore won't walk in and greet me effusively like they are so happy to see me when I know damn well that they tried to trash me online--but hey, he's a pompous fool who just likes to hear himself talk. Aaaaaahhhh it felt good to finally get that out. Really, I should have said something to him the first time he barged in and pretended to be happy to see me. He's just one of those guys who talks and talks and when you finally get a worde in edgewise he's just waiting for you to finish, or take a breath so he can start talking again. He doesn't listen, doesn't retain anything anyone says to him. He's too busy bowling everyone over in this crazed attempt to talk talk talk as much as he can. I should have told him... anything. But I sat there, being polite. Ah, well, I didn't feel like getting a lecture.  A more pressing reason for my move&nbsp;is that  twice  in the last  two  days, I have been mooned  in the middle of the afternoon  by my 300+ pound, late 40s, male housemate. EWW! He walks around to the bathroom with just a tee-shirt on and keeps walking even though he can here me out here. Then, when he's done in the bathroom, after he's seen me when he walked to the bathroom, he walks back to his room and--well, I'll leave that to your imagination. I mean, c'mon you are in a bathroom... wrap a towel around yourself if you know I'm out here. Better yet, show some respect for other people who are living here and make sure you are decent before you leave your room!   Sigh. I'm a little frusterbated. I need to design an invitation for the CCHR exhibit  Destroying Lives: Psychiatry Exposed  exhibit. Oh! The dates, locations and times were finalized so here you go if you'd like to check it out!   Grand opening: Friday, August 6th, at 11:00 a.m. at the Vancouver Art Gallery.  At the Art Gallery August 6th-8th and then showing at the Vancouver Public Library, South Plaza from August 11th-14th.   Each day it is open from 9 a.m.-9 p.m.   Back to designing the invite, I can only use MS Word. Piss. Oh well, then I have a meeting tonight downtown to get prepped for working at the exhibit. Then I'll be sending out tons of invites to MLAs and MPs... and then my sweetie will pick me up and take me home.   I can't wait to have my very own apartment!

       Terminating downers   Yesterday was&nbsp; such a full day of getting things figured out. I felt pretty darn good at the end of the day, despite not getting to bed until 2 a.m.   Tomek figured out something for himself yesterday:   The KEY to terminating a downer is to have a day OFF and spend at least a few hours outdoors walking and taking about stuff.    Simple you say? Ah, but this is coming from someone who used to snuggle with Mary Jane to relieve their stress or downer. I'm so proud!  I met with Peter yesterday, and we just touched base to make some plans for the Fall; he may also have a student for me starting up pretty quick. In the Fall he'll want me working there Monday-Thursday afternoons, which should give me enough time to do my own tutoring as well.  Speaking of tutoring, I've been thinking a lot lately (did you notice my little  urlLink mood recorder ? It doesn't annoy me yet, but we'll see...) about being creative, and doubting my own creativity because of the stall I was in with that construction writing. I've since realized that tutoring in itself is an immensely creative process.  Why? Because each student is different, they all have different ways that learn best at. Some by sight, some by lecture, some by getting their hands on what they are actually studying. I have to figure this out when I meet students and work with them, and constantly gauge how they are doing, what way of learning they enjoy and have successes with, and which ways aren't so successful.   So I'm back to believing I am a creative person. I just wish my poetry would start flowing again. I'm not going into any dark corners looking for inspiration right now; I could, and could probably dredge up some decent stuff, but I'd like to write about happier times, about positive inspirations.  Today I had my first tutoring session with the sixteen-year-old. We did math, and the hour went pretty quickly. I had wanted to do two hours, and he had agreed over the phone, but when we met he told me that he could only stay for one hour because he was going to Surrey and he couldn't concentrate for more than an hour. Hum. It didn't take me long to figure out which reason for not staying was the real one.&nbsp; I'm meeting with him and his mother tonight or Thursday evening to set up a firm schedule, and I am going to insist on two hours. I'll give him a break between the hours, but really, if he wants to get up to snuff, we need to be putting in a few hours each session.   &nbsp;

       I've been Ikeanized!   That's right, I had my first Ikea experience yesterday. Here's what happens when you walk into Ikea: Step through the doors and two or three hours will pass in the blink of an eye. I swore I'd never go into Ikea, but Tomek and I met his friend Nick and his girlfriend Tara there; Tara was all excited about buying stuff for when they move in together. When we found them, she stuck a blue bowl on my head. She was already wearing an orange one. Ha.   The neatest part of going there&nbsp;was how so much of the product reminded Tomek of Poland.&nbsp; He found this stool that is shaped like a fuzzy cube, but the top comes off to reveal a space to store stuff. He and his brother each received one of those as a present from their parents one year, and his mom got them locks so that they could each have their own private treasure chest to store all their...well, treasures. The way he got so animated and excited over seeing those stools again was heart-warming. I love seeing him smile and laugh, it warms my lil heart.  On a smaller note, the decor interested me because I'll be moving soon, finally, and while I already have a fair amount of furniture:   bed  desk  dresser with mirror  three bookshelves  futon  reclining squooshy armchair    ... it was fun to look at the little accessories I could get. I definitely want a brightly-coloured aparmtment!  Oh, and as a proud side-note, I'd like to mention that I got all three bookshelves free (one from my parents, and I found the other two abandoned at my storage unit), the armchair free (picked up from storage unit), and the nearly-new queen-sized futon for $50 from my landlady!    Caring about others, running the risk of feeling, and leaving an impact on people brings happiness. - Rabbi Harold Kushner

       A hummingbird? At 11 p.m.????    Tomek and I are eating ice cream sundaes in the kitchen and all of a sudden we see a tiny hummingbird flitting around the hanging flower basket outside. I remember hummingbirds only staying for a few seconds at my parents' home, but this one was snuffling away in the flowers and taking his sweet time. We watched him for over a minute, and wondered... it looked kind of ugly, it had antennae, and we couldn't see it's beak...   Turns out, it wasn't a hummingbird urlLink ...

       Great Day!    For the past few days I have been hunting down math books to tutor this sixteen-year-old student I have. I finally borrowed some from the retired headmistress of Heritage School (where I worked from April-June of this year). We had a great talk and she gave me lots of great suggestions on dealing with this kid. He's been expelled from many schools, and hasn't had a chance to learn a heck of a lot. He's hoping to get accepted back into Heritage in September, but he needs to get through a lot of studies through tutoring before then. Now that I have the math books I can get the BC curriculum outlines and start tutoring him in math! Sadly, he's only at a grade 5 level, but he has an interest in learning and getting up to speed in his education, so I (along with Heritage) am going to help as much as I can.   While I was talking to Gale (the retired headmistress), she mentioned that she'd talked to Peter Paulus today (the director of West Coast Tutoring, who I worked for earlier this year as well) and he told her he probably has work for me for the rest of the summer, afternoons from Monday-Thursday. Then, come September, he wants me working there a lot more. He pays good money and he'll give me the hatting I need to successfully get my own tutoring centre off the ground in Vancouver.&nbsp; It's so great that he'll have work for me for before September; money has been getting pretty tight again.   The main reason it's been getting tight is because I cannot get inspired about writing this marketing material for a construction company. Ugh. But my wonderful wonderful boyfriend suggested today that I get another writer to help me. Of course! One of my classmates (and a close friend of mine) lives very close to me, and she's a great writer. I hope she'll agree to work with me, then we can split the pay and get the job, and some money, rolling.   It feels so good to be pumped about my jobs again! And Tomek to me this evening about his job and how he wants to get his TQ certificate in alarm installation and then start his own translating service, which will be so cool because he's already fluent in three languages and has a curiosity and strong interest in linguistics and languages. He's recognized the need in himself to work at what he loves, and I'm so glad that he and I are on the same track to that regard!   I'm going to sleep tonight happy and pumped up about what I have to accomplish this week! It's so great to feel energized about work and not dreading Mondays!

       "I miss you." "I'm right here."   Why do I miss Tomek when we are standing so close, holding each other and he's looking at me with such love in his eyes that I get dizzy?  I guess I'm trying out that "stream of consciousness" writing that J mentioned.  I suppose in the physical universe making love is as close as two people can get. But there are times when Tomek and I are as close as we can be, and it still doesn't feel close enough to me. I suddenly feel very clumsy in this body, with these hands that can only touch the surface of his body. I feel distressed being so far away from him; knowing, sensing that it is possible for me to be closer, albeit perhaps not while having a body.  What is it like when two spirits are as close as possible? I'm tired of kneading his body with my hands, touching him frantically to try to communicate something that is not possible with a body, much less with words.  I tell him that I feel like I've known him before, and he acknowledges me, but I know he doesn't believe me because he doesn't believe in reincarnation. It's difficult for me because that was what preluded my feelings of "falling in love" with him. It was very spiritual. I felt that we were a continuation of something that came before. But he was brought up Roman Catholic and experienced much with different substances, and sometimes I feel we are on quite different levels of existance. Despite all that, I love him, and he loves me--  That word seems cliche to me now: love. And making love--with Tomek making love is a form of communication. I feel we express things that can't be said with words. It's so much more than the materialistic view that most people I know have. Making love = sex = pleasure = orgasm... it's all focused on pleasure of the body. Sure, people who are in love make love and it's great. But is it great because they have "mind-blowing orgasms", or do they feel something more: something they can't explain?

       urlLink  I know exactly what you mean!       I'm driving into Maple Ridge on a four-lane road where the speed limit is 50 km/hour. In front of me, in the right lane, a car slows. I slow. It slows some more. I slow more. Going about 20 km/hr, it turns on its turn signal. It creeps around the corner, and stops with it's bumper still in the lane.   I lay on my horn and the driver jabs his arm out his open window and flips me off with authority.   What the hell?   I was suddenly reminded of a driver who was in a lane to the left of me, and sitting in my blind spot. His lane was merging into my lane. I was just driving alone, and he honked at  me  as he had to slow down to merge behind me.   Dumb-ass.

       Inspiration: Part II   Wondering about my current lack of poetic inspiration, I remembered one of my largest sources of inspiration: J.  What we had was ethereal (characterized by lightness and insubstantiality; as impalpable or intangible as air). Ours was primarily a written relationship; we spent little time together in the one and a half years we had, but corresponded at a level I don't think I'll ever find again.  And reading through the hundred and fifty-five odd emails I have from him, I'm not at a place to say any more, other than to post a poem I wrote to him in 2001:    Ether ridge   Your words undulate around me a soft glow envelopes me  seeping into my head filling me with new realities and a greater understanding of myself  taking root in my heart all is tucked away and cherished  Listening to you everything becomes possible and anything can be real  (even you and I)  © Krista Zundel, 2004  And his response:  wow, i am impressed, flattered, slightly trepidacious, anxious, pleased and aroused all at the same time...:x  i especially like part where my words "undulate"around you, such visceral imagery, yet ethereal at the same time... u may be on to something :D  keep the ink flowing... stream of consciousness writing is one of the best ways to overcome writers block.  ................. I'm feeling quite distant now.................

       Snapshots.   She's tottering towards me with a pizza box. It's dusky but the light from the street lamps illuminates her incredibly long legs and brassy blonde hair.   "Honey." She repeats it again and again, calling down the road to the man who just wove by me, his half-buttoned shirt revealing a smooth, waxed chest.  I picture them together in a dank apartment, he's an alcoholic and she stays with him, drowning in her own insecurity.   As she and I approach each other, I can see that her&nbsp;eyes are bright, her hair well kept. She flashes a mischevious grin and calls out, "Honey, I think you're staggering."  She'll be all right.  * * * * *  It's getting dark as I plod up the hill from the Sky Train, consciously walking slowly so I don't get any hotter than I already am in the 35 degree heat.   I hear a dog snuffling up the road behind me, and I turn, squinting to see if it looks threatening. A boxer ploughs up the road by me, with a handsome black man in tow. The man glances over at me, flashes a brilliantly brilliant grin and says, "Great to have the warm weather, uh?"  I manage to croak out, "Oh yeah" as he gets tugged up the street and into the darkness. I wish he'd stayed to chat.

       Why I hate car dealerships.     Replacing bulbs     &nbsp;   It is becoming increasingly more and more difficult to replace vehicle light bulbs since in many cases, other parts of the car must first be removed before you are able to get to the bulb. This applies especially to the light bulbs in the front of your car which you can only reach through the engine compartment.     &nbsp;    WARNING        H7 bulbs are pressurized and can explode when being changed. Potential risk of injury!    On vehicles equipped with gas discharge bulbs life-threatening injuries can result from improper handling of the high-voltage portions of such lamps!     &nbsp;   For your safety, we recommend that you have your authorized _____ dealer replace any bulbs for you, since your dealer has necessary tools, the correct bulbs and the expertise.    That is a quote from my owners' manual. I've since realized that the manual is almost completely useless. My first clue should have been when I noticed that the majority of the manual is devoted to controls and equipment (e.g. how to unlock and lock&nbsp;doors and turn on high-beams).   My tail lights went out recently, so of course I turned to my manual to see if it would tell me how I could change them. I always changed the headlight bulbs in my old car myself (which was the same make as my current car), and had every intention of changing the taillights myself. No such luck.&nbsp;Slammed with danger and warnings by the manual (not to mention treated like a three-year-old),&nbsp; unable to find information online about changing the taillights, and hundreds of kilometers away from a manual my dad has that would tell me how to change them, I made an appointment at the dealership.   Oh, and I went to Canadian Tire before looking in the manual, to pick up the bulbs I'd need. They have the bulbs for up to a 2001. My car's year is 2002. The 2001 and 2002 bulbs were probably the same, since the model I have has been made since 1999. Thinking back on it, my naivety is shining through. Oh well. I know now to only go to dealerships for warranty work.   So, I make an appointment at the dealership, and they can't see me for a week, which means I can't drive in the dark for a week.   I get to my appointment, and wait  an hour and a half  for some guy to change the bulbs. I watched him change the bulbs, too. He opened my trunk, sat down on the back bumper, and popped the bulbs out and replaced them while talking to a fellow employee. Note: no protective gloves or eyewear. That confirmed my suspicions that the manual was spewing a load of crap intended to get the dealership more of my money.   It gets worse. I got my bill--  $30.00   for labour. What the hell?! I should have lit into them then and there. But me being me, I haven't yet mustered the courage to light into someone when they deserve it.   Oh, and part of the reason I waited so long: they washed my car, vacuumed the front half, and put a free newspaper in my car. Dammit, last time I went I got mints, too.   The last time I went was for my transmission; it was kicking. And it still is. Last time I went, they said it was low transmission fluid. That was suspicious to me at the time because my previous car was a 1989 version of my current car, and the transmission fluid never needed to be changed, or topped up. My car is still under warranty, so I will be going back in on August 4th for the transmission work. I have to remember to take my "tough" pills so I don't look like some little clueless customer that they can jerk around.   This whole experience could turn into a good thing, now that I think about it. If I gain the ability to call people on their bullshit, I won't find myself sitting and being polite to people who pretend to be happy to see me, but whom I know have pompously rambled out falsehoods about me.   In closing, a note to you all: if your car manual is written in such a way to frighten you off from doing any work on your car yourself, ignore it. Buy a mechanics manual for your car, and change those light bulbs yourself! Furthermore, avoid dealerships unless it is warranty work! If your warranty is up, or you have a used car, I recommend finding a small, independent, trustworthy shop to work on your car for you. I went to a one-man shop to get work done on my old car, and the mechanic knew me by name, and took me out into the garage to show me the problem with my car when he found it, then explained how it should and could be fixed. It was a sad day for me when he retired!

       Why my guy is great: Part I.    &nbsp; The water at Harrison is freezing. My feet hurt as I wade in, but my&nbsp;back is burning from the sun and I am determined to go swimming, no matter how cold the water is. Tomek dips his foot in and quickly retracts it. "No way!" he says.  "Aww, c'mon," I cajole. "We'll go in together!"  He gives me a look, and&nbsp;I hope he&nbsp;realizes this is going to be just as painful for me as it is for him. I take his hand, and together we stride into the freezing water. With a vain attempt to lessen the degree of cold, our walk becomes a pained, slow-motion run. We keep our hands clasped together, and hold them high as we go deeper and deeper, our faces both grimacing against the cold that has past our most tender points and quickly approaching our chests.   I hear someone laugh and look out ahead of us. A lanky guy with dark, curly hair is watching us and chuckling in amusement. He is sitting high and dry on a surfboard.  Tomek and I decide we've had enough of slow torture and flop forward into the water. Brrrrrr, but so refreshing!

       What the hell is happening to the automotive design industry?    I saw  urlLink this  car/SUV/tank today. It looks okay... in my rearview mirror, from afar. But then, I have a blantant preference for European cars (and a large dislike for SUVs). What got me about the Magnum (which connotes guns), is that the visibility (or lack thereof) it provides to the driver. And with the prevalence of carelessness and disregard for everyone else seen in many of the drivers I drive around, reduced visiblity is not a welcome addition to my driving experience, especially not if you pair it with some bimbo who is brushing her hair with both hands while driving 120 km/h down the highway in heavy traffic, or the ever-busy guy who is flipping through his cds while chatting on his oh-tho-thpiffy cell phone. (That's my long sentence for the day.)   Oooh, I'm trying not to be morbid here, but what if the Magnum met the Toyota Echo hatchback in an accident? Or the Hyundai Accent? Or the Mazda Protege?&nbsp;Sit in any one of&nbsp;the latter three&nbsp;if you want to know what it feels like to ride in a tin can!   My car, on the other hand, is great. It doesn't feel like it's made of plastic ( urlLink dent-resistant doors  anyone?), has good visibility, good gas mileage, and a clean, attractive design. Oh, not to mention the dashboard lights! They're blue and red--combine those with all black interior and a late night drive: yum!   In fact, I wrote a poem about those lights. I'll post it here, to finally respond to the comment posted a while ago.    Blue dashboard light   &nbsp;  Running away isn't an escape anymore  the crushing, closing in of negative space follows  and pervades  I can flee briefly-hiding under a lover  darkness cover me   I give myself to too many, hoping for love  for naught-   At the right time, I'll be taken  innocently, in daylight  without having to give all of me  in return for simple pleasure   So I let darkness consume me again  Stars above  Blue dashboard light  Keep me company in solitude tonight&nbsp;  © Krista Zundel, 2004

       I figured IT out.    I wrote a mid-term in college in 2000 on Eavan Boland’s poem  Lace , and recieved the following response from my instructor:   "Krista, this is just one of the best pieces I’ve received from you ever. You are really coming along nicely. You show all the necessary details from the poem that’s needed to prove your reading concerning the connection between the lace maker in the poem and the poet writing the poem. A great job all around. Bravo to you.   GRADE: 99/100"   Aaaahhh. A great memory from back when I simply  wrote . But now, I have so much to say and there are so many ways I could say all the things I have to say and what if I don't pick the best way, and on and on.  That  is what is holding me back. I'm so concerned with how to write what I want to say that I've let my ability to just write it. But, hey,  knowing is half the battle.    I've also realized what's holding me back starting this tutoring centre. It's much the same thing: I don't know where to start. And what if I get ahead of myself by focusing on one area more than the other? For example, I promote to get tutoring cycles without knowing exactly what I offer. But how can I know what I offer until people request services of me? I can provide what people request, I know that much about myself. But I don't even have a name yet! Or a logo, although I'm leaning towards using an owl, and the colours burgandy and yellow, or just royal blue and yellow--bright colours, in any case. Instead of wondering where to start, I thing I need to get really organized about what exactly I need to do in each area of the centre, and take one at a time and do them. Back to the drawing board--er, admin scale.

       Inspiration: Part I   &nbsp;  Sublime.  &nbsp; Yes, mostly-drug-free me was inspired by a band whose lead singer, at the age of 28, died of a herion overdose.  &nbsp;  Why do they inspire me? Because they wrote about issues prevalent in society that are either not taken seriously, or are just not talked about. And they presented these issues to their audience in such a way that just perhaps, caused small changes for the better to be made.  &nbsp;  Of particular inspiration to me is the song  urlLink Date Rape .  &nbsp;  Guilty consciences tried to slam me, and I got slapped on the wrist by higher-ups for writing on this topic, but that won't stop me. Others are listening, and many have told me their stories, which I  will  share. It's only fair.

       Lakes    There is no action more peaceful than floating on one's back in a Canadian lake; with nothing to see but the sky, nothing to hear but one's own happy hum.    O happy day! I have three tutoring cycles now! One popped up this weekend, and I just closed another this morning.  &nbsp;  I finally visited Harrison Hot Springs this weekend and the beauty is comparable to Algonquin Park. Even though we spent most of the day in the car, I came home completely relaxed after being surrounded by such space, such simplicity. I've always thought of myself as a city girl, but now... being surrounded by field, trees and sky inspired me in a way I've not felt for a long time. I got an idea for a book. And it didn't run out of my head as soon as it popped up, as they usually do. It hung around and let me play with it and slap it around all weekend; now, it's quieted down and settled quite nicely behind my left&nbsp;ear.&nbsp;I never thought of myself as one who would write a book; I've always been more of a five-line poetry girl. Surprise, surprise!  &nbsp;  My boyfriend wants to  urlLink fly . And while I don't have the courage to join him, it will be a thrill to watch him. I love that he loves being out in peaceful space as much as I do.

      My passion for writing does  not  include writing marketing material for businesses. I talked to my client today and he had read over my rough draft, and so had his wife, who also works in the company, and the entire first paragraph was labeled “dull”. Well, of course it’s dull! I haven’t figured out how to write a lively, catchy piece on repairing a roof yet. Maybe I should use a car analogy…cars seem to be a status symbol in this city, and some of those with nice cars probably own nice houses as well. Hmm, that’s worth a shot.  But I am still definitely focusing on tutoring more than writing. Tutoring is so much more fulfilling. My learning centre’s angle is definitely going to be raising literacy levels. I’d like to get more involved with the World Literacy Crusade.  &nbsp;  Here’s a quote from the home page of their web site:  &nbsp;  “ The World Literacy Crusade would never degrade a child by giving him or her an educational label such as Learning Disabled, Hyperactive or Attention Deficient. It is against our policy to do such a thing. Ritalin, Prozac or any other drugs are never used on children in our programs. We believe that the use of such drugs is a direct attack on the spirit of the individual. For those who administer these drugs to our children, it is an excuse for their own inability to teach or communicate effectively .”  &nbsp;  Pretty gutsy! It’s disappointing that the site apparently hasn’t been updated in five years, though.   &nbsp;I did get a bit back on track with my tutoring centre today. I know what I have to offer is worth what I am charging, but right now I only have one student, and if there are others reaching, but they aren’t willing to pay what I charge, I think it is going to be beneficial, since I’m just starting out, to agree to a lesser fee for now. Once I get established, I’ll gradually raise my rates to what I know is fair exchange. Having some clients at a lower rate is better (and more lucrative right now) than having none while charging a higher rate.

       Altered Meanings: In Religion and Psychology   My writer's block has disappeared and now I'm suffering from an overwhelm of ideas. Religions now fascinate me, largely because I'm a Scientologist and my boyfriend is Roman Catholic. I've been thinking a lot about Jesus, and a number of questions have arisen through my own thinking and conversations I've had with Tom.   Mary and Joseph had children other than Jesus. True? If so, what were their lives like?  Perhaps Mary Magdalene and Jesus married... and had a child, and a bloodline.  Would Jesus have wanted his teachings and beliefs to be institutionalized the way they are today? Can't his followers believe and practice anywhere? In a park, at home, with friends?  What is meant by "practicing" a religion? It seems people can practice just as well on their own by doing their own reading, praying, singing, and believing.   How much of the way the Bible and other writings are now is different from the originals? For instance, my friend read a book that had some of the original writings of the Bible in it. Apparently, and I haven't read the book yet, so don't quote me on this, "The meek shall inherit the earth" was originally "The high-spirited shall inherit the earth," which makes much more sense to me. Take responsibility for your own life, don't just leave it in someone else's hands. Being in control of your own life is the only way you can have any smidge of assurance that things are going to go well for you.  Who wrote the Bible? If Jesus's apostles were "common folk" could they read and write well enough to write the sections of the Bible?  Did Jesus write anything?  What exactly happened to cause Rome to fall and that civilization to die out?  And what of the possiblity that reincarnation and past lives were part of Christianity at some point, only to be deleted? Why would it be deleted? Who would want people to start believing that they only had one life? And why? That takes a lot of the spirituality out of that religion, I think.   Speaking of a loss of spirituality, what about psychology? The first definition in my dictionary is "the science that deals with mental processes and behaviour"... yet, the derivation shows that "psych-" and "psycho-" come from Greek  psukho-  meaning "soul, life". I found a fascinating  urlLink article  on this when I searched online with the terms "definition" and "psychology". It's easy to get all caught up in the nuances of a word, and I don't intend to here. What is psychology really up to in Canada today?   According to the  urlLink Canadian Psychological Association , psychologists focus on these topics:    mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, phobias, etc.,   neurological, genetic, psychological and social determinants of behaviour,   brain injury, degenerative brain diseases,   the perception and management of pain,   psychological factors and problems associated with physical conditions and disease (e.g. diabetes, heart disease, stroke),  psychological factors and management of terminal illnesses such as cancer,   cognitive functions such as learning, memory, problem solving, intellectual ability and performance,  developmental and behavioural abilities and problems across the lifespan,   criminal behaviour, crime prevention, services for victims and perpetrators of criminal activity,  addictions and substance use and abuse (e.g. smoking, alcohol, drugs),   stress, anger and other aspects of lifestyle management,  court consultations addressing the impact and role of psychological and cognitive factors in accidents and injury, parental capacity, and competence to manage one’s personal affairs,   the application of psychological factors and issues to work such as motivation, leadership, productivity, marketing, healthy workplaces, ergonomics,   marital and family relationships and problems,  psychological factors necessary to maintaining wellness and preventing disease,   social and cultural behaviour and attitudes, the relationship between the individual and the many groups of which he or she is part (e.g. work, family, society),     This doesn't seem to have a heck of a lot to do with the spirit. It seems spirituality is very closely related to religion, and not with healing. But if one believes that they are the spirit not the body, it would make sense for some branches of healing to focus on the spirit, would it not?

      Production  is  the basis of morale!  And I was so right that being a freelance writer is not for me! I sit here in the morning, dutifully tap-tap-tapping away, offering solutions to those plagued by inept roofers, construction jobs gone bad, or a lack of aesthetics in their home. Then I brainstorm on different ways to promote Kerr Construction, without costing them... well, much more than what it costs to keep me happy.   What pains me is that my employers motto, when it comes to my writing, is "quantity before quality". Ummm.... no. Not if my name is going on these articles! I've had to attempt a new level of assertiveness to ensure that my rough drafts are not fired off to be printed in tomorrow's paper. But that is just one of the many facets that could shine through on any employer! So we adjust, we flexible freelancers.   So, after sitting here for a while, writing, listening to my roommates snore and reheating my coffee so many times that it ceases to be coffee, I start feeling lethargic. And it's only 10:30 in the morning! The solution? I get busy in a different way. This morning, for instance, I made a list of things I needed to do today. A good thing, lists. There's something about crossing off item after item as I go through my day, and then finishing with a day planner day chock-full of crossed out cycles.   But then, I think I've always been quite a visual person. I love to people watch, I learn more by writing and drawing diagrams than listening to lectures, and I have a huge fascination with car design.   So what is it my mouth salivates whenever I see either of these two cars?   urlLink    Porsche 944&nbsp; urlLink    This car belongs to  urlLink this fellow , and my dad had a similar one when I was younger. I remember even then preferring it over the 911, which is all the craze now, in the Porsche world.    urlLink    Volkswagen Corrado&nbsp; urlLink     I discovered the Corrado, which I believe was only in production from 1990-1994, years after my dad got rid of his 944. I get silly whiplash every time I see one on the road, craning my neck to ogle for just a few extra seconds. I’m no expert in design terminology, but every time one passes by, I get a “Yummmm” hum in my chest, and of course salivation is inevitable.  Working for Volkswagen appealed greatly to me a few years ago—gee, I  have  been riding around in their cars for most of my life…and I can write…  Whump! Back to the real world, as my roommate belches contentedly in the kitchen.   A thought to leave you with: all the work I’ve had since moving to British Columbia, I got from people I knew. To me, there is truth to the rather sardonic saying “it’s not what you know, it’s who you know”. But the what you know comes in handy after the who you know, because then you have to prove to them that you know what you know, and can use it to their benefit.

      Delivering Messages   I may have inherited my love of getting the mail from my dad, but it might also be attributed to my incessent curiosity about messages. What is the author trying to express with what he creates ( be it written, drawn, painted, etc.)? Is he trying to send out dual messages? Does he intend to inform or deceive? Why is that message being broadcast? Why are some messages continually suppressed no matter how persistent their author is? How often does the intended audience actually receive the author's message, not to mention understand it? What senses are most counted on when an author attempts to convey a message? (Side note: everyone learns about the "five senses", but from what I've read recently, there are over 100. More on that later.)  I've seen this image around in an advertisement and instantly wanted my own.   urlLink    Attraction&nbsp; urlLink    Not the product, just the image. Am I tempted to try the product? Not really. What is the product? Take a guess.

       Most people can do extraordinary things if they have the confidence or take the risks. Yet most people don't. They sit in front of the telly and treat life as if it goes on forever.  -Philip Adams   It's been far too long since my last post, but I have a good excuse!! I've been writing for money! Wahoo!  It's not the most stimulating writing in the world, but this particular job does require a lot of creativity, and I've had lots of good ideas that have impressed my client. *big grin* Even better, my first pay cheque from them is in the mail as I type.   I realize now that I was very smart to pursue a full-time career in something other than writing. I was fortunate enough to realize, through working at the  urlLink Douglas College Learning Centre , that I want to and can make a good living as a tutor. At the same time, I eliminate writing under time crunches by writing for venues and organizations of my choosing to help out, not necessarily for money, and keep the occassional freelance job as it comes up.   urlLink This  is the company I have a contract with, by the way.  I still love writing, but more for personal expression than just for money. If I could do both that would be wonderful, but for now I'm happy mostly writing for myself. Writing marketing material for companies doesn't jangle my chimes much. I still would like to focus my writing in human rights and education.   Speaking of human rights, I decided not to take that job as Director of the BC Chapter of CCHR, because I need a more steady income than could be provided to me by that job. But I am back actively volunteering for them; I am now helping with preparation for the  urlLink Psychiatry Kills exhibit  that is coming to BC for two weeks. I'm gathering contact info for MPs and MLAs and other high profile members of the community to invite them to the exhibit. We are going to be at the New West Quay, in Victoria, and at the Vancouver Art Gallery so far... more venues to come!   Next weekend I'm heading down to Oregon to help my mom's tutoring centre with their promotion.  urlLink Turkeyrama  is rapidly approaching!

       Oh... I get it   Now that I have received a few more emails from J, I can see that the first one was just... air.  I admit, my first reaction was "Whoa!"... then "Waaait a minute, a year and a half ago, you ejected me from your life, after you found out I loved you."  I guess he was trying to see if he could pull me in again.   August 6  Hey Sweetpea,      Long time no text!   You have been on my mind recently, tho so far no recollection of subconcsious sightings.  My life has been a horrendous whirlwind of disaster and defeat...      I know it may sound dramatic, but seriously without a doubt, in no uncertain terms it has been the worst possible year and a half of my corporeal existence.      I really can't go into it right now, I'd need a day or more without interruption just to give you the cliff notes version.  To illustrate only a glimmer of what I mean, I cannot safely use this email addy any longer.  I have gone back to my ______ mailbox, so write me there, if you haven't already.      I am sure things are going well for you and I would dearly love to see you, hold you.  Very few things in my life left with any consistency, stability or objectivity.  You, however, remain a constant vision, a feeling of security, dependability and joy for me...        I look forward to reclaiming the relations we have embraced from so far.      J      And the latest:  August 9  Thanks for your concerns about my miserable life... this too, like all things, shall pass.     Wow, he must have been pretty damn high when he wrote the first one!  True, J broke my heart, but Tomek mended it and now it's better than ever.

       Continuation   I met with Rob (my business and life advisor of sorts... maybe just a good friend) on Sunday morning. We had a three-hour talk about religions, stemming from my wondering why religions weren't spiritual. The last posting was my rambling release of some of what I realized and was thinking, written after a 5-hour nap and before a 10-hour night sleep. Whoa!  It makes sense that religions were first formed to help free man. Or to make the spirit more free while in the body. Perhaps so we remember and retain the knowledge that we are spiritual beings. From what I'm seeing with people I am getting to know, many people are so focused on bodies and physical images, and it doesn't occur to them that maybe they are more than bodies.  I think that's a real shame, people believing they are just bodies, and going along with life as if this is their only existance. I wonder if there is a correlation between the number of people who believe they've lived before and will live again and those who are into making the world a "better place". But I'm sure that there are lots of people who do work to help improve the lives of others and to make things better for coming generations because they want the world to still be here for their kids and grandkids. Maybe making a difference would have an even greater meaning if people knew they were doing it for themselves as well.  I believe in reincarnation and that I've lived lives before, but it's still not real to me that I'll come back, and I'm not sure where or when I'd come back and even if I'd have control over that.  Here's a thought: what if great leaders, and those who made a positive change in the world (which can be interpreted differently depending on the culture, I suppose)  were not in bodies, but then saw somehow what was going on on Earth, and saw that they could make a difference, and then came down and grew up and made that difference?  And what if people growing up is just the spirit brushing up on how to use the human body?

       Religion vs. Spirituality   The main religions today aren’t very spiritual. The probably started out spiritual but have since been altered to control man. Take Christianity: Instead of being cause over one’s life, one puts ones own survival in God’s hands. God is responsible, not the being.  Drugs: What they do to the body isn’t such a big deal, especially if taken infrequently. I never looked at it from being just a body perspective. I only looked at it from a spiritual perspective; Tomek looks at it from a body perspective. Now I understand why he’s so casual about taking drugs. But if he understood my viewpoint about what it does to a person’s spirit, maybe he’d understand the seriousness of the consequences. Drugs alter a person’s mind. The mind is a running track of pictures of the person’s previous experiences and lives. Drugs disorganize the pictures, so one might remember something that happened three years ago as happening three weeks ago. Also whenever one comes down off a high, they get all the other times they came down off a high restimulated.  I can understand Tomek’s curiosity and possible desire to hallucinate. This is similar to the concept of “going exterior”, where the spirit leaves the body and a person is viewing things from, I guess, the viewpoint of their spirit. Of course this wouldn’t be real to someone who was brought up believing they live only once, and after that they go to heaven or hell. What a choice. You go through your life, and for what?  Of course going exterior (or being high) feels good. That is the way one should feel when one is freed from their reactive mind and things that are restimulated. It is a wonderful sense of freedom. But one could feel that good all the time w/o being on drugs if they just handled their reactive mind so it wasn’t having a subconscious effect on them. That way, one can have the high without ever coming down off it.

       E-mail from my dream     So I e-mailed J after that dream to see what he's been up to. I had thoughts of him being engaged to his girl (last I heard, he was living with her) or married...  Not so...   My life has been a horrendous whirlwind of disaster and defeat...      I know it may sound dramatic, but seriously without a doubt, in no uncertain terms it has been the worst possible year and a half of my corporeal existence.

       Get moving, Krista! Okay, okay...   So I'm getting back on track with this whole tutoring dealy. I just called Bobby (the 16-year-old)'s mom and I'll be tutoring him for 10 hours next week. Yay!  Now I'm putting together a survey of possible names for my centre. I need to make sure the name appeals to people and also gets across what I do (tutor).  Aah... it's amazing how much more connected to the world I feel now that I have a phone number again.  In other news, I'm totally and completely broke. I think I have about $10 that's not tied up with the stupid 5-business-day bank hold.  Maybe I feel so good because I got up at 9:30 this morning. Whatever it is, I'm feeling pretty darn good right now.

       It's alive!   My little termite of a cell phone is alive! I can't believe I stooped this low... although it is for business, mostly. My first bill, with all the activation fees and crap, is going to be $140. Ha ha ha!! Ulp.  I have a lot of posts building up on my not-connected-to-the-internet-yet computer, but I forgot my disk they were on, now that I'm finally at a computer with internet. Dammit.  (12:08: found them and posted them.)  I was at the exhibit for 7 hours yesterday and finally answered someone's questions! The guy was from Austria, and didn't speak English very fluently, so I had to do a lot of translating. But I realized how well I actually do know some of the data presented there, which made it a lot more fun to be there!  The exhibit is running this weekend from 9-6 at the Vancouver Art Gallery. Check it out!

       Wrestling... and realizing   There’s no way in hell I’m letting some plant come between me and the guy I love. My anti-drug upbringing is making me respond too strongly to this; I’m reacting more than thinking analytically about it all. I’ve been mulling it over all week and trying to figure out if there is a middle ground and it seemed like there was no hope. But then I’m with Tomek and there’s such kindness and love in everything he does when he’s with me. Yeah, he has trouble confronting some things in life but so do I. Different things, but still. He isn’t in a state of nervousness the way I am. He just goes out there and lives his life, and I’m to worried about death and pain. This may be making me sound like a nutball but I don’t care. I don’t have the patience to go into a more long-winded explanation than that.

       Mental wrestling     Most of what I know is what I learned in my childhood. In times of doubt, that’s what I return to. Trying to form a new opinion of something that goes against everyone I’ve known for years, and the religion that’s been in my life since I can remember, is difficult.  Thatcher told me on Monday that I if I ever need anything, or need someone to talk to, I can always come to him. That was after he’d given me a locational after I’d been crying because Tom said he felt like CCHR came together to attack the psychs because the psychs had attacked LRH. CCHR was co-founded by the Church and a psychiatrist. He didn’t press me to find out why I’d been crying, and I didn’t tell him, even though I’m starting to feel like I need to confide in someone. I refrained because I feel I need to fight my own fights.  Ever since Tom came to my place high two days ago, I’ve felt distanced from him. I have no desire to make love to him. I’m not going to fake anything towards him. I don’t know if I am going to go back to how I felt about him before, or if something unfixable has shifted. I think I already know that he’d choose weed over me, and I guess I’m wrestling with that knowledge because I know it’s wrong; I know I’d never choose a substance over a human being, unless they were asking me to give up something I needed to survive. At the same time, I still feel like I don’t want to lose him. I think it’s unreasonable for me to shut off like this despite how much he’s done for me, and how much he’s helped me come out of my shell and feel something I’ve never felt before. But I wonder if this is the lasting kind of love. Or maybe it’s like J… and I’ve just gotten to spend more time with Tom than I ever did with J.  I was listening to  Tommy  by The Who today…   She knew from the start deep down in her heart that she and Tommy were worlds apart…    The theme of the summer was “come unto me and love will find a way”…

       Aww... despite everything    I want to snuggle close to you; that's the whole point of sleeping together.  -Tomek, after I commented that, while I now have a queen-size bed to sleep on, he doesn't seem to be taking advantage of the extra space.

       Bitchiness comes in handy   Today was the day I took my car in for transmission work. I was there at 8 a.m. for a road test with a mechanic, and my car being a VW... it wouldn't make the same noises and kicks that it does when I drive it. Piss.  So I left the car there and they called me at 1:30 to say that they were done and it was just that the transmission fluid was a little low. Like hell.  I had just finished another tutoring session with Bobby who, while doodling, wrote "Bobby killed the dog for fun" on his math paper. Nice. So I built up my anger while driving over there, and when the service man asked me to sign for work done, I refused.  Yep, I told him straight up that it was unacceptable that they were just going to leave me with "low transmission fluid" as the cause of all the jerking around and kicking that my car was doing. The poor guy wasn't expecting this from me, I guess, but I got quite heated, and wouldn't sign the paper.  I'll have to edit this post later and add more detail... I basically blew the guy away, so another guy came to talk to me, then I went for a road test with a mechanic and THEN i got some answers. The mechanic also has a Jetta, and he talked to me about noises and stuff instead of just repeating "The computer didn't find anything".  Apparently I have a "learning transmission" that gauges when to gear up and down based on how hard or lightly the owner uses the gas pedal. It'll gear up at higher RPMs if the owner is a lead foot, for example, than if the owner is a gentle person who is never in a hurry. Neither of those are me; I fall somewhere in the middle. So sometimes the transmission kicks because it can't make up its mind what gear to shift into. Sounds way to complicated for a car, but it's apparently for emission purposes. Hmm. I couldn't tell if that was a load of bull or not, but at least I can ask for that mechanic next time, instead of dealing with service manager tools.

       Krista vs. Mary Jane   If these two were to meet and duke it out, who would be victorious?  Your guess is as good as mine.

       Remembering my dream   I dreamed of J last night. I saw him on the road while we were driving, both in BC, I think. He was driving his black Toyota Tacoma pick-up truck. He came to visit me at my parents place; a place we’ve never lived. He was still living with his girl, but we kissed a few times. I remember it feeling like he was kissing me in a very friendly fashion, quick, close-mouthed kisses that were meant to be casual. Towards the end of the dream he wanted to sleep with me, but I think only because I was reaching for him so strongly and he could feel it. I think we wouldn’t have had sex, since it was unspoken but obvious that he would go back to his girl, and never stay with me, even though I loved him.  Note: During this dream, I was not with Tomek.  I think I was dreaming this soon after I fell asleep at Tom’s, or maybe it was after I went pee at 4 a.m. Tom couldn’t wake me up last night, and I wonder if this dream was keeping me from him.  I’ve never been one to assign value to dreams, or try to interpret them, but this time I have to wonder. Was it trying to show me something that I already have figured out and decided, but just hasn’t surfaced yet? So, was it something in my deep sub-conscious that rose to the surface of my thoughts when I was sleeping? Is it saying that Tom and I are doomed, because I still have the same opinions that I had when I was with J (although now they are more reasonable, I think)? Or is it telling me not to compare J and Tom because they are two entirely different people?  Now that I think about it, J was thinking about coming up for another visit, before things between him and his girl got “serious”. But I had just met Patrick at the time, so I nixed that idea. I wonder where I’d be now if I had let him come, and we had slept together again? Ha. Looking back on it, I can’t believe I chose Patrick over J. I wonder if J was just wanting to come up for “fun” or if he was wanting to try again with me, and give me another chance?  Still, I wonder why he came to me in a dream last night? Is it because Tom is starting to parallel him? A guy who I love, but is fond of substances?

       Just walked into a screen door   And that about sums up my day. Tomek came home today after a visit with Mary Jane, and a couple of beers with Nick...  I used to think that Avril Lavigne's line "You choose weed over me/you're so lame" was just her talking about some dick-wad and that I'd never associate with anyone who would choose a substance over a human being. But that line is slowly eating it's way through me. I'm starting to feel the way I felt when Rob (my ex-fiance) was blocking my every attempt to make our relationship work. I love Tomek very much, but I don't want to be near him or around him at all when he's even remotely high. He's so different. It feels like he's the shell of the guy I love, and the one I love is hidden away, or gone. He misinterpreted a conversation we had yesterday about drugs, and us reaching a middle ground. He thought I had understood and somehow agreed with where he was coming from, so after almost two months, he thought it would be okay to smoke up again.  But it's tearing me apart. I love him and I want to be with him, but when he's high, I feel like the love I have for him drains away. Even being near him now, I feel like I'm going to cry.  And I feel so homesick--only problem is, I don't have a home to be homesick for. I did live at my last place for... over a year, I think. Who knows how I endured that: the filth, the grime, the complete lack of interest in doing anything to make the world a better place. Ugh.  Maybe I'm just PMSing...at any rate, I'm too tired to cry.  I did receive another cheque from the government today, bringing the total amount I've received up to $124. No complaints here. I actually paid my rent on time and in full, and have enough for car insurance with some left over. Hooray!  And I set up my computer at my new place today, in a corner by two windows. So it's bright and I have a view of the street. The futon I got from my last landlady for $50 is in great shape. The mattress is like new, and very comfy. Plus, it is easy to fold back into a couch. Since the width of the couch is the length of the matress, it becomes a very big, very comfy couch.   Flowers do not force their way with great strife. Flowers open to perfection slowly in the sun.... Don't be in a hurry about spiritual matters. Go step by step, and be very sure.  -White Eagle

       So it is...   I've moved, and I could not have done it without Tomek's help. It was just the two of us, and boy I've accumulated a lot of stuff over the short time I've been here. We spent most of the day yesterday (11 a.m. -8 p.m.) cleaning the place I was moving into. He vacuumed and I scrubbed counters, sinks, bathtub, cabinets. He cleared so much dirt out of there it was incredible. He even found an old dog chew toy and a sock under the bathroom counter!  I think we've both decided this is a temporary move, so I don't plan to ever completely unpack.  We went to Wal-mart yesterday to pick up some essentials (shower curtain, cutlery, tea towels, sponges, Comet, cutting board, etc.) and he was so excited that we were buying stuff for "our" place.  We didn't start moving my furniture until after 8 p.m., and didn't finish until midnight. By then we'd both been up since 7:30 (I'd worked at the exhibit and he'd hung out with me there in the morning).  I'm still stunned so I guess I'll cut this post short. I'll be back in a couple of days... although I'll probably be able to post since I'll go over to Tomek's in the evenings this week.

       Symphony of Light   I forgot to mention that I went to see the Swedish night of Symphony of Light last night. The fireworks were shot off this enormous barge out on English Bay, and the entire barge was lit up with white lights. Then, this older gentleman who was standing next to me offered me one of his earphones. He had the music that the fireworks were being played to... and it gave me shivers. The music was mostly symphonic (duh...I guess, but I'd never heard of this celebration until very recently), and they did Amazing Grace--how they can time the fireworks that well is beyond me.  And Tomek told me they used to be called the "Symphony of Fire"... but now since they are no longer sponsored by cigarette companies, and are now sponsored by BC Hydro, the name got changed to Symphony of Light. Bah! Everything's an advertisement...  Ugh, I'm feeling that unsettled, vaguely homesick feeling again. I hate this feeling. My room here is all bare, and tomorrow all the furniture and food and the rest of the boxes will get moved. Then I'll be without a phone number and internet for a couple of days. I'm getting a cell phone for work, and it will probably take a couple days to get the cable hooked up. I'll be able to go to Tomek's to use the internet though, so posting here shouldn't slow down any.  Here's a tidbit from a phone conversation Tomek and I had earlier. I almost wet myself I was laughing so hard...  Me: "...You've really helped bring me out of my shell." Tomek: "Oh? Are you an escargot? You must be, since you are so succulent."  I cannot  believe  something like that came out of his mouth. It was hilarous!  *Sigh* Insomnia strikes again. I think I'll go change my imood. I've been stunned for a few days now.

       I smell skunk.   Yes, my soon to be ex-room reeks of skunk. Yech. I can't believe this is the first chance I've had to actually sit down at the computer today. But I've been moving, moving.. heh heh moving, moving...you move. (Joe Cartoon... if you don't get it, go  urlLink here ... it's a little sick I admit, but the voice is funny. And I can imitate it pretty well. Ha!)  Anyway, this evening after moving all day I went down to the New West quay and helped out at the exhibit. It's pretty impressive. We had 350 people come through and the vast majority of them were interested and left comments like: "Awesome!", "Impressive", "This is a blessing in disguise!", "I'm glad somebody's doing something about this!".  We'll be at the quay again tomorrow from 9-6  Argh, I don't have the energy for an interesting post tonight. I just had a rootbeer float and now I'm totally drained.  Tomek is helping me a lot with the move, though. He has a lot of stuff from when he moved to Toronto, and he's going to rent it to me long term... and he's planning on moving in with me in a month or so!  Sheeit now it's almost eleven, I didn't write any poetry today, and I still have lots to pack.
