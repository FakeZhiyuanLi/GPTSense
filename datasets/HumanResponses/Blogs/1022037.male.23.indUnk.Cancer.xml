      Aaaaaahhhh....... mornings! know that it is still kinda early for some people ( esp for this NS guy too). But I have to wake up early today. Helping out with some Red Cross work today.   Came back very "early" yesterday, around 1:30am +. Hee hee, i know i know, you all must be wondering what I was doing until so late and here it goes. One of my friends,  Shiwei , was celebrating her sweet 18th birthday at the NTUC chalets. So together with some other close friends like  Lawrence, Alfian, Chiu Weng, Dorlisa, Guan da, Peishan, Chwee Ying, Jack, Jiayun and Shiyin , we all enjoyed ourselves at her bbq.  Strangely enough, we found out that it was also Guan da's birthday today, And so when it was time to cut Shiwei's birthday cake, we "offered" to celebrate his too. And as tradition goes, there was the usual sabotage of the birthday babies. It was like a war zone down there, cakes flying around, faces covered with the after effects of the attack.   Well, I hope that the 2 of them enjoyed themselves as much as the rest of us had. And here's wishing them again a big  Happy Birthday.  take care and I'll be back soon.

      Just back from camp. Tried out the new 5 tonner aka the MAN truck of the SAF. Was quite an interesting experience with one of the latest technology equipped vehicle. Hmmm... finally finishing my course liao, left with hopefully only another day of islandwide driving tommorrow before going back to Sembawang Camp for another course. Time sure passed by fast. I can still remember as if it was yesterday when I first learnt how to operate the Landrover and the 3 tonner. Really picked up some life long skills that I can use in the future.   Now waiting for my dinner, wonder what's cooking? I have a sudden urge for pizza, esp the new sausage stuffed chessy one. Oh man, I must resist the urge. ( gotta use the FORCE, like in Star Wars.hahahaha)  Also listening to the radio by internet to my favourite station  CLASS 95  fm. Had been listening to the station for over 5 years because most of my favourite songs are played daily.   with that, I think i shall end here. need to bath now. adios!

      Back from camp not long ago. Had a quick dinner and wash up before finished packing my stuff for tommorrow. Having a small test on New Year's Eve. can you beileve that? the very thought of it makes me feel very sianz. But what to do, it is part of my course syllabus. so in army lingo, " LAN LAN LOH !".  Today I was made duty I/C for my course. was actually feeling normal , thought i was going to cock things up. WHew!! Had a few scares and mistakes here and there, But as they say, learn from them and be a better person. Some of my coursemates "sabo" me by turning up late for muster parade and lessons. Wanted to "kill" them ....argh!!!! I knew I was going to hate been a Monday I/C. the reason why?? because confirm a lot of people will be suffering from the MONDAY BLUES.   Time seemed to passed by today relatively slow. Was reileved when I Bersurai the course at 5:30pm, it was like a great burden been lifted off my shoulders. Sad thing thou, I will be I/C again soon in the near future. Despite been Red Cross trained to be I/C, in army, I would tend to refer to play a low key role. as in be a follower than a leader. Don't ask me why I have these 2 extreme cases.   Hmmm.... a few more hours to the  New Year's Eve . Let me take this opportunity to wish all my dearest family members, friends ( be it from Red Cross, Army, Sec Sch or esle where) a  HAPPY NEW YEAR  in advanced and may the new year bring them joy, love and happiness. Personnally, I wished that I get the chance to tell a certain someone  that I really liked her. I also wish that I passed my course and get posted to a unit near my place and I will be happy serving my 2 remaining years in army.   Once again Let me wish all a HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!!!   it is time to reflect and make changes.... ;)

      Missed me??? i hope you did. hmm.... must be wondering what I've I done during the last few days , right?  In Summary, For Christmas, I spent the first half of the day cooking for a potluck cum bbq at Chiu Weng  's place. had invitied us there for the holiday. Made  mini pizzas  and my sinful  chocolate fudge cake  while  Alfian  fried his wedges at my place. Travelled via MRT & bus to his house , meeting  Xuan Hui  and  Weiji  on the way there. Saw  Lawrence  for awhile while he was waiting for bus back to camp. ( poor guy, have a hapy new year , broz!)   Once at Wengster's place, saw  Mr Ang, Cuiying, Lina, Si Yun, Ming Hua , Chee Yong and Chin Kah . Chit Chatted and ate until about 9+ before heading back home.   Thurs was a boring and unproductive day at camp. ( that explains everything)  Friday was the start of my Sergeant course, the  Transport Supervisor Course . Met new friends and learnt quite a number of new stuff too. After camp,  Dad and Sis  fetched me home so that I could change and head down to Campsite where there was a volunteer drop in night. Saw a series of familiar faces but too much to list out here. Great to see them.   lastly, today had halfday at camp. went home, had lunch rested , changed, then met Alfian to go  East Coast  to cycle. ( had not cycle since i went in NS) finished at about 730 before heading to Alfian's place for VCD watching. the movie screening was " WATER BOYS". very comical show.  alright gtg n wash up liao. nights.

      Just back from  Parkway Parade , did some really last minute shopping for food and presents for my family as well as friends. Think I spent about $100 within 2 hours. ( Heart ache sia... been overspending my allowance liao. die  :(   )   well, at least i hope it is worth the money spent.   Will be sleeping late tonight. might be chatting online with some juniors and then play computer game for a while. One more hour to another of my Buddies,  Weilun 's 21st Birthday. a bit sad thou, having to go back to camp on your birthday , but I guess what to do , we got to serve the army. Here's wishing him a happy birthday and may all your wishes come true. Most probroably will be meeting up  ALfian  and  Pishu  to cycle first at  East Coast Park , then hopefully  Charlene  and  Jenny  can make it down before Weilun join us from camp.   After meeting the gang, in the later evening, I will be heading back to change for another birthday, this time it's my eldest cousin. going to be a long night and day ahead. betta stop here now. seeya.

      Slept well last nights.... one of the most comfortable sleep i had in days... mainly due to the fact that it is a Sunday. hahahahaa. Finally it has come. It is the final countdown to the year 2003. Now as I sit here and relect on events that happened during the last 12 months, I realised that this had been a year of many "first".  Let start with home, first time in years that I did not go overseas with my family. Next, Red Cross, First times for attending many events; like the First Aid Competition, Footdrill Competition, Info quiz Competition and the talentime. A first to be in charge of 2 school units. first time I organised an event. How about friends? Well, met lots of interesting juniors and seniors.   Also included my first few days of my BMT at Tekong with my new platoon mates. then, it included my first time driving a vehicle and carrying an armed weapon. But most of all, the year to me was memorable because it was my first time I ever liked a gal for a long time. ( Whew!, finally said it... been such a heavy load to bear.. feels so gd to have it off my chest). I admit, there is a one gal in Red Cross that I liked and other than my dear buddy ALfian, only a handful of others know of this.  Not sure if you call it love yet, but I sure won't call it a crush. When I see, hear or talk to her, I feel so happy. it motivates me to try and do better. for that, I should thank her.   Anyways, enough about that, Let me tell you more about yesterday. Finally managed to catch " b>Lord of the rings: the two towers  " at Tampines with  Alfian, Xuanhui, Shiyin, Chee Yong and Ming Hua . It was still almost sold out. we only managed to get the tickets because we had to be spilt up in 3 groups of 2. It was fast moving and entertaining movie and definately worth the weekend price. Had some makan and photo taking before getting on the MRT home. But before watching the movie, I had the rest of my Red Cross friends at the campsite for the   Senior Warrant Officers Course Passing out Parade  . Had a few of my cadets who attended the course and so I wanted to checked if they passed the course. Saw a lot of people there, which included  Joyce, Dorlisa, Shiwei, Eugene, Doreen, Richard, Evelyn and Chwee Ying.   After the parade, went down to Bedok Central to have desserts and some other snacks.   hmmm... suppose to meet Alfian later for cycling, but the sky looks threathening.praying hard that it does not as I am in good need for a little exercise. been putting on weight as of late. Have a need to burn some extra fat at my critical areas. Hahah. Keep in TOUch.

      Headed home from camp considerably early to their standards. Furthermore, when I was at the MRT, I managed to get an empty train and got myself seated thru out the whole journey. So I must say I was quite lucky today.   Thou I am sad that I have to go back camp on a Sat, I am extremely gladed that the weekend is here. Not only can I meet up with my normal group of Red Cross Friends, I can also do very last minute shoppings for Christmas. But sad to say, I don't have that special Christmas feeling this time around. Maybe it is due to my committment to the nation. I don't have that much of a freedom to enjoy my holidays.  Alright, gtg... wanna watch TV before sleeping. Tommorrow gonna meet some of the juniors up for a Passing out parade and maybe after that catch  "LOrd of the Rings 2, the two towers" . nights!

      So did you miss me? I really had a Really  REALLY  busy last week.  After I came back from my Sunday guard duty days off, it was already Wednesday. And as I was booking in and signing the attendance sheet, one of the  RP  came up to me and told me that I was to be attached to another section of the camp for "labour work" for a field camp. Reluctunately, I accepted as I would managed to get my days off on Sat and Monday so as to attend one of my Red Cross camps.   During the field camp which lasted from Wed till Fri, me together with 3 other trainees had to load and unload heavy stores for the camp. Was pretty hard work, couldn't imagine how those old days coolios could do it. Anyways, Luckily for me, those 3 days flews past fast. There was one think I found out , 3 tonners are not good places to sleep. my back still aches for sleeping in one.  Spent my days off for that duty doing duty for Red Cross. Helped out at the  National First AId Competition  as a cameraman. after that, was the camp proper, ACOC. Together with  Doreen, Wilson, Nicky, Lina, Yee Pei, Desmond and Hui Min , we had to teach and accreditate the new bunch of HQ volunteers in the 3 core components of the Red Cross. We had some moments of pleasure as well as moments of seriousness. I can't believe that my then Sec 1 cadet in now joining the HQ as a volunteer instructor. It makes you wonder how time flies by so fast. Only just recently too, my dear Buddies  Law, Justin and Alfian  just finished their BMT in tekong and are now on their blocked leaves. So how, I kinda miss those days. those days of innocence, days of freedom and nativeness.  Just one the last day of the day, I got a call from my camp, telling me that my next course was on the following day and taht my applied leave had been cancelled. Thou I was sad at first, i then realised that the faster I get this over with, the faster i could rest.  So right now, I am already half my thru the course as it is only a 1 week course on maintenance. Hoping for the weekend, been dying for it for a long long time. the reason:  LOrd of the Rings 2  is here !!!!!!!!!! and this time, I watching.   alrights, going down for the pin, it's time to sleep. tommorrow's another long day. adios!

        "Who you are makes a difference".    This simple statement kept me thinking throughout the whole night yesterday while I was doing guard duty. It pretty much relates to anyone,  anytime or anywhere. Be it if you're an army personnel like me, or a civilian like yourself. Sounds pretty cheem right? but really, the above-mentioned statement made me ponder about how small things can change one situation to another. Let's say in a unit, like my current camp at Sembawang, if there was no Warrant Officers or Specialists around to supervise us, the young privates, what would you think will happen? All hell with break loose, there will be a lack of urgency, discipline and so on.   You must be thinking why I suddenly talk about this.  I guess, I have to thank my parents for that. They had encouraged me to kill my time doing guard duty rest time reading a book. So I decided to bring the 1st issue of the  "Chicken Soup for the Soul"  series and boy, I'm glad I did. It made me wonder , wonder how all of us have without even knowing it played a small but important role during our time on Earth. ( oh no, i think i am starting to talk rubbish, think i betta stop here).  Anyway, let me tell you what I've been doing for the last 1 week.  From Tues till Thurs, rotted in camp again doing the same things: Fall in , Eat , Sleep and Go back home. Thursday was my most demoralising day this week. Found out that all chinese privates had to stay in camp till 5pm while the muslims went back at 12nn.( worst of all, they dragged the dismissal until 7pm..haiz) Secondly, found out that we had our leaves not approved and that we had to come back to camp on Sat. Lastly, Was given no choice but to do Sunday Guard Duty in camp. ( ya  Weng , I know. you say it's no BIG deal, but to me it is. What to do, it's the army, Lan Lan kena shoot)  Friday was a public holiday and was my only full day for me to enjoy. Was actually decided to watch "treasure planet" by myself because most of the gang was busy. But I found out the timing was not to my favour, so decided to watch "007". And when i did, I remembered of  ALF  and asked him how was his Hari Raya and if he was free to watched with me. To my delight, he said ya and together with another old friend of us,  Pishu , we headed to Marina Square to catch the 4:00pm show. ( the movie was up to the standards of the previous ones, with lots of action and intrique) After the movie when we were on our way back,  Weilun , another of my Broadrick Sec Kakees phoned me and asked if wanna meet up for Dinner at Parkway. As we ate, we chatted about NS life, the changes at Parkway and other stuff. Explored the new GIANT outlet and was on the topic of the competition of the supermarkets at Parkway. This is because there is also NTUC Fairprice and Cold Storage around the area.   as for Sat, as I said earlier,  went to camp in the morning. After camp, Mum picked me up from camp before we headed home so that I could change and eat a bit before meeting up with the rest of the  West District VIs  gang. Was the first one at Somerset MRT before seeing  Chiu Weng, Justin, Shiyin, Alfian and Jiayun  respectively. Was joined later on by Xuan Hui   and together, we had sort of like a food marathon. First went to Orchard Point for my Tunch ( tea and lunch together) with Justin , then headed to Centrepoint for  Tea Leaf & Coffee Bean 's  coffee. After that, Justin left us and we went in the direction of Wheelock Place where we had a light dinner at the  Burger King  outlet there. Lastly to top off the marathon, we took a bus to Plaza Singapore's  Swensens  for Ice Cream desserts. During the desserts, all of us decided to Play "  Truth or Dare " less the dare part. Was quite an interesting session for all. The 3 ladies found out the 3 guys' dream gals while the guys found out more what were the ideal guys in the ladies' minds.   Finally to end, let me tell you about my first guard duty experience. to summarise, there was only 2 words to explain it. the first was Tiring. tiring because I  had to stand on guard for 2 hours straight before resting 4 hours and then 2 hours again continously for 24 hrs. Was quite lucky that my timing was quite good. 11:30am - 1:30pm, 5:30pm - 7:30pm, 11:30pm - 1:30am and finally 5:30am - 7:00am. the next word would be "boring". The reason why is because I can't do anything except survey the surroundings. Can't sleep, Can't eat, can't even go to the toilet while on my shifts.   to end this really really long post, I reileve that I got my 2 days off for the guard duty and shall fully use the time well. Good nights!

      Evening pplz, how was your day today? I know mine suck. almost wasted another "meanful" day doing nothing again at camp. Know what I did in camp today? here it  goes :   7:15am- reached camp; 7:15 to 8:00am - waiting to fall in; 8:00 to 10:00am - fall in , attendance taking and then shake legs; 10:00 to 10:30am - canteen break for makan-ing breakfast; 10:30 to 11:30am - sleeping in an empty bunk ( like a pig ar? eat then sleep); 11:30 to 12:00nn - surprise uniform inspection by the unit CSM( sergeant major for those who don't know); 12:00 to 12:45pm - waiting again for falling in for lunch; 12:45 to 1:10 pm - Lunch; 1:10 to 1:45pm - Booking out and leaving camp.( the CSM gave us half day off because they did not have anything to do with us and did not want us to do anything...so heng heng lohs) .  After I was out of camp , went home for a while before heading to  Parkway Parade  to do some window shopping. Saw 2 old friends whom I have not seen since i went to NS. they looked great. On the way home , started to rain a bit, think will be storming soon. Pray pray that it will be raining until early tommorrow then can have a comfortable beauty sleep. (  Like it when it rains when i'm asleep)   hmmmm.... enough about today, let me tell you about my weekend. This week was totally spent on Red Cross Volunteer work. Had an event early in the morning yesterday. Was considered a quite big scale event that needed manys weeks of planning and dedication from the volunteers. Yesterday, we went to  Tampines Changkat CC  to show our community spirit to the elderies of the Lions Befriender Homes. Over 120+ edleries came and with the help of the schools cadets and guests performers, they were treated to a catered lunch with performances. the old folks were also given goodie bags with items donated by various schools and volunteers.   Overall, everything ran smoothly thou there were the occassional hiccups now and then. Compliments to the ogranising committee for their hard work. When it was time for the folks to go back, it gives a sense of satisfaction when you see them leaving with a smile on their faces or hearing them saying "thank you" in their own dialects. That was one of the reasons why I love doing these type of work. and I will continue to do so whenever I have the time to committ. Another reason for helping out is that I can meet up old friends or even make new ones, personal relationships can be build up even better during these type of events. We learn new things and these can apply to us in the nera future.   Well, i think I said enough for one day, time to eat my dinner. stay tuned! ADioS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Before I start, I would like to wish 2 of my close friends,  PIshu  and  Gisela , a happy birthday today. For him, a joyful  22nd Birthday , you're the man now, gonna  serve the nation soon. take care. And for her, a sweet  18th birthday , you're another yr old, and getting more wonderful, enjoy yourself with your special someone.   done with that , on to the normal stuff, greetings, just finished packing my bags for field camp this whole week... won't be hearing from me for a while.   Thursday and Friday were quite quiet days for me. Spend the days in camp in the comp labs. Then went to my HQ for a meeting with my juniors for an upcoming event. As  Gisela 's birthday was coming up soon, we had a small celebration for her at the HQ, ate some cake before going to  Plaza Singapore  for dinner.   Sat, after camp, I sahked legs at home for awhile before meeting up with  ALfian  and  Pishu  for a game of pool and bowling. It was  Pishu 's Birthday also this Sunday and we decided to ask him out. Played with them till seven before having dinner with my family and some overseas relatives whom are visiting.   as for today, Had came back home from  Newton  area , where I watched the   Red Cross Talentime 03   together with  Chiu Weng . Saw  Doreen, Jorin, Melissa, Jian Fu, Shiwei and JOyce with her boyfriend  there too. started a bit late and ended one hour late too. The performances that the cadets showed were interesting, touching, realistic, geniune and suspenseful. Bravo for them for putting up such a great show. all their hardwork weren't wasted. Earlier in the day, we met up  Alfian  at  beach rd  to buy some army stuff. I bought some camp paint and foot powder and additional ziplocks. had our lunch before we said bye to  Alfian .

      Yeah... already past the midweek portion of the week. Can't wait for the weekend.  Sunday was passed with  Alfian , went down  Suntec City  to catch our First  R(A)  show, the  Golden Chicken . Was quite funny and interesting. After that, we bought some things from Carrefour before heading to  Parkway  for our dinner and more shopping.   This week, I learnt more about SAF style map reading. Played with new gadgets as well as did an orientation walk in camp. Yesterday, we did plotting of waypoints that we would use today, where we took turns to drove islandwide. When it was my turn, I scared the rest of my coursemates by going in reverse instead of forwards, but after a shaky start,and a few stalled engines, I managed to get my momentum and got to my checkpoint.   Shall end here as I'm tired, but without an meaning saying that one of my friends,  Charlene  sms-ed me. :   " Sometimes expressions are best kept to ourselves, a simple smile is more meaning than laughing, so when I was asked if I like you, I just simply smile! "

      finally, my first hectic week is over!!!!.. yuppie!!!!!  Finished my first of 2 field camps on Thurs, during the camp, we learnt how to do various things like camo-ing the 5 ton truck, doing convey movement and the process of loading of stores from one pt to another pt. Mon and Tues were used to prepare for the camp. Tuesday, had to missed my grandpa's 80th birthday because of the camp. what a shame, that I can't go. Friday I practically had to dragged myself out of bed to go back camp. visited the  army logistics base  around choa chu kang before going back camp to have lunch. There were a few reservists who came to join us for 2 weeks and together, we had our lesson on Map Reading. It was totally different in some aspects from the type of map reading that is done in Red CRoss.   Yesterday , after camp, I met up  Alfian  at  Whitesands . Bought some sweets and snacks for a bbq that my ex cadets from  Hougang sec  organised. Also bought a new bag to replace my old one. Took the bus there and finally found the pit. the cadets were happy to see  Alf  and me again . and even more happy to see my cute turtle. Saw  Annie, Keng Wei and JunJin  and 2 other new VIs there too. it was a big crowd. The weather was playing tricks on us, it rained on and off. Luckily when it stopped, we mananged to get things cookings. later on, saw  Zhiwen and Wenlong   .  Alfian  leaved early because his dinner was cooking at home. so wenlong and me decided to go to  Fishermen's Village  to buy  Fried Oyster and Chillied Stingray  to fill our stomachs up a bit. about 10pm, we all started to make our way back. ( oh ya, saw about another 5 people i know when i was there, 3 ex cadets from Pasir Ris sec, 1 TP friend,whom i saw but she didn't see me, 1 platoon friend celebarting his birthday too)  hmmm... don't know what will I be doing this afternoon ... so cozy now, in my aircon room and it's gonna rain....shoik ar ... feel like sleeping again. heee....

Saw  Dorlisa ,  Jiayun  and  Angeline  there. On friday, saw  Eddie, Katherrne, Fahmi, Yu Lin, Alfian, Mr ANg, Evelyn and Cui Ying  for a district meeting.  2) Sat - burnt the day at camp in the morning , learnt to use a crane and then went for Red Cross recruitment drive at  Tanjong KAong Sec  with  Evelyn and Huda and ALfian . Then went to  Parkway  to buy present for  Dorlisa .  3) Sun - went to  Sketches at Robinson Walk  for  Dorlisa's 19th Birthday  celebration lunch. Met up with  Lawrence, Elaine, Mr ANg, Mr Tan, Wei Qiang sir, Shiwei, Jian Fu, Wendy, Joyce and her bf, Xuan Hui, Weiji, Justin and Edwin.

      Whew!!! It is already almost the mid week portion of the week. Can't wait for it to be over. Like i said in a previous blog, this is quite a hectic week for me, got 3 tests to go thru ( 1 is down, 2 more to go), 1 presentation ( which is not uneven prepared... ai ya..die liao loh) and a MT line excercise inspection on Friday. This is not including the fact that I still got some  Red Cross  commitment near the weekend as well as a friend's birthday outing on Sunday too.   My schedule for the next few coming weeks are quite tight too.. got a field camp next week and more tests. So you may not be hearing from me sometimes. hmm... speaking of the camp, gotta find my field pack items by friday so that on Sat , i can buy them.  alrights, enough of talking about work or NS. let's try a new topic. hmmm..... ok.. i know ... another quotation .    " Life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you are going to get."   friom the movie  Forrest Gump , starring  Tom Hanks . I believe this quote very much sums up how most of us feels right now.Like the unforunate collision of the  RSN Courageous  and the Indonesian ship off the island of  Pedra Branka  ( deepest sympathy to the families). Imagine in a short time difference, about 4 lives were taken away, 4 young lives. This shows that life is short and we should enjoy every moment of it.  Tell your parents, family or loved ones that you love them, it will sure  warm their hearts, esp now that it is still considered the festive season with the Chinese New Year coming up at the end of the month.   Think of it for a moment. good nights.

      Just backed from Orchard. Actually wanted to catch " Gangs of New York"  together with  Justin, Dorlisa and Alfian . But once we reached  Plaza Singapore , there was such a long queue and most of the shows were sold out or selling fast. So we decided not to watch it today. Instead, we went to meet  Angeline , Xuan Hui and Chiu Weng  at  Wisma  for dinner at Breeks!. saw Peter on the way there.   Once we were there, we waited a while to be seated. when we got our seats, we quickly ordered as we were famished. Had their  Cajun Fish Fillet  and an  Ice Blended HAlzenut MOcha  drink. That costed me $18.00 already. Chatted during dinner talking from army stuff to JC prom nights to common nonsense.  Had a pretty tiring day. Didn't sleep well last night. Was worried about a test in camp. Good thing was I passed that test. But that is only the begininng. I still goit 3 more tests and one presentation to go thru next week. willbe one hectic week. It will included a day visit to another unit for an exercise inspection.  think will have supper now. my stomach is crying out for more food. take care and gd nights!

      Had a new year hang over today. Felt very tired when i woke up. Could barely open my eyes during the long journey to camp.  Fell asleep during lectures a few times, luckily managed to wake up before I was caught. WHew!!!... The lectures today were extremely dry and theorical. Practically the whole course was still in the holiday mood. And I don't blame them.   Oh yes, today is the  first school day  of the new year. Saw lots of teary secondary school students on the MRT when i boarded. ( tell you the truth, I really missed my schools days , be it primary, secondary or poly... there was slightly more freedom then compared to my time now in army.)   Time flew past pretty slow, it seem a lifetime to me. Was relieved that we managed to dismissed a bit early in the evening. My whole body needed a good rest on my comfy bed.  Mum  picked me up from  Paya Lebar MRT  after she finished school. Appreciated that. Anywayz, I should hit the bed now, still got another 1.5 days of course left for the week, which will include another test on Sat morning. Haiz... adios!

       HAPPY NEW YEAR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   It's the start of the year 2003, gone are the days of the year 2002.  Reflect , Remember and Recall  all those memorable moments.   Had a pretty dull New Year's Eve. Had camp in the morning then my Red Cross district meeting at hq before having dinner with my family. quite sad because I got " homework" to do during New Year's Day. Have got to finish some assignments for my course and pass it up on Thursday. Basically , I got to design a vehicle log book and fill up forms ( like huuray, I'm so "excitied" ....sorry for been a little sacarstic, just the thought of my holiday is used to do work pretty much demoralises my mood) .  hmmm... I wonder what the rest on doing now?? if they are over at  Siloso Beach at Sentosa  enjoying the foam party or at the  Singapore Expo  listening to DJs flown in from London or are they just Sleeping???   it's getting late, betta turn in early this morning so as to wake up early to do work. I shall end with this sentence which I found quite interesting. Try thinking about it this new year. byez!

      hmmm.... my first week of in camp staying was actual an outfield exercise. Went to camps in  Jurong and Lim Chu Kang . pretty tired for those few days. HAd been sleeping in a landrover for 3 days, without bathing. Only had a powder bath once a while. Luckily , we had fresh rations everyday. Managed to book out on Thursday night because yesterday was the brigade day at  Sentosa . WoW!, missed my comfy bed a lot.... slept well and almost did not want to wake up to go  Sentos a. once there, we played beach volleyball, soccer and even had a sandcastle competition. In the afternoon, we went around the island for a treasure hunt. felt a bit odd, but never mind, enjoyed myself. took  Bus 10  back from  World Trade Centre  and it was such a long ride.   Today, I visited 3 schools,  Tanjong Katong Sec, Pasir Ris Sec and Victoria School  to help them in their footdrill. The competition is just next week and all schools are doing their best and practicing hard. Met up  Huda, Fahmi, Alfian, Eng Kee, Yong Cheng, Katherine, Mr Ang , Chwee YIng and Lawrence  at  Dunman Sec  for a short while before i went to  Victoria . stayed long enough to celebrate  ChweeYIng 's  18th Birthday  which is coming up next week. After training at  Victoria , met up with some of them for a bite at  BK Tampines  and then headed home home on the train with  Law . Talk about some relationship matters and also about the coming competition all the way until our stop.   Just finished watching " Something about Mary"  on  channel 5 ... interesting love cum comedy story. checking my mails now. sayonara.   let me end by wishing  Chwee Ying  a Happy 18th Birthday , all the best to you in your studies, be as cheerful as always and enjoy yourself on your special day.

      hmm... doing a quick post before getting ready to stay in camp. Haiz... reminds me of my  BMT  days... oh well, did not have much of a choice. I'm stuck there until end of next year.   I finally clocked in my first few miles in order to get my civilian license. drove almost the whole day islandwide. First went to  Changi  , then to  Ang Mo Kio  and Seletar  before going back camp because  ALex  was on half day leave. during lunch, saw one of my father's friend's son, he was in the signals company at the camp. glad to see a familar face over there. After lunch, another 3SG took over and we drove to  Nee Soon Camp  for my orientation. Learnt also how to top up via a POL card.   Yesterday, went back to  Sembawang camp  because the unit was collecting a few 5 tonners from  Sembawang . After which, we passed by  Bedok Camp  as part of the orientation driving. And it was from there where I drove back to camp. Shared a cab with some of the guys to the interchange. Then I headed down to my HQ for a meeting. Was there until 5 before i went to  Parkway  for a reunion dinner with my family.  Dad and sis  was flying off to China but I did not send them, was pretty tired from the whole day.   As for today, I just only finish packing my stuff to bring over to the unit. it took me like forever sia but i made it. chilling out for awhile before washing up and leaving house. Take care. Won't be hearing from me until Friday. byez!

      greetings....went down to my new unit today. This is where I'm going spend my next 1yr 10 mths at..Found out that it is a stay-in camp within only a few occassions that I can have nights off. Pretty excitied yet scared. Maybe it is because I'm new and unsure of things.   Met my "mentor"  Alex , a pretty nice guy. He is ORD-ing one yr before me on the same date. ...Will be packing my items soon once there is a bed allocated for me. oh ya.. the bad things i found so far about my new unit are 1.) it is so  ULU ...luckily got shuttle. 2.) some of the senior officers there are really  on the ball  type, hope you know what I mean. 3.) there are a lot of admin & vehicles to maintain.   Will be starting my stay-in next week onwards, so you might not be hearing me for a while. take care. n seeya soon.  before I go, I would like to wish all you couples out there a  "HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY"  ... enjoy yourselves but don't blow your wallet.  hee :P

      another week has passed .... and finally, it is the end of my course. Should be feeing happy now that it is over, but I'm feeling a bit sad too. Sad because the time to slack is over and it's time serious work.  Before i continue, standard procedures, let me tell you how I spent my days.  Thursday and Friday were mainly spent learning about supply procedures, like identing stores, procedures for condemning items. Overall, it was quite boring and everyone felt sleepy during those 2 days. Forunately, there was a lot of breaks in between to wash up.   Saturday morning arrived but most of us dread it. The reason? the whole morning in camp was on project presentations. Time flew passed fast, thank God. After which, I took the train down to HQ for a district meeting and a  Youth Officers Sharing Session.  Saw a lot of familiar faces like my senior officers, my ex teacher officers and a lot of my juniors, which included  Katherine , whom I have seen her grow up. She told me taht my ex sec sch unit was having a camp fire and had invitied us for the event. So after the meetings, we headed down to the school. Saw my ex teacher and her husband. Enjoyed myself there that night. oh ya,  Alfian  popped by too. That night also went to by grandmother's house for prayers. ( it is an usual New Year custom)  Sunday was spent with my family. Went to my Uncle's place for lunch-tea-dinner. My Aunt had bought  LonTong  and invitied us to come over and eat. Played cards with the rest of my family members for the rest of the afternoon. Ended up being the biggest loser , losing $2.30. ( thou seems little, it was the biggest amt lost, kays)  Yesterday, we visited the  3rd Transports Battllion , as part of our course. Learnt about Air and Sea Transportation methods like how to rig a 3-TONNER from solid ground to a craft, as well as how stores are dropped from the air and also how the SAF uses a helicopter to carry vehicles.  As for today, I'm happy because my course has ended as I said. As I reflect on these last 7 weeks, I have many fond memories. I've experienced a lot of new knowledge and skills which would help me in the furture. I gained valuable experiences from the NS men and other delegates and even my coursemates. Today, I found out where my new unit will be, It is  Pasir Ris Camp , 10 SIB . So now, I will be waiting for them to come and pick me up.   Lastly, to end, I would like to wish my Malay friends a  Selamat Hari Raya Haji . take care.  ps: sorry ar, post so long... heee

      I'm back..... did ya missed me? Sorry that I haven't been blogging as of late, been busy.  2 major events have just passed for me, the first was my  field camp , 4 days 3 nights. Finally managed to clocked my mileage during the camp, as well as brushed up my skills on things like camou-ing and been an IC army style. Learned a lot from the camp. But I was equallly relieved when it was over.  The second event , of course was the long weekend, thanks to the  New Year . spent the eve recouperating at home and having the reunion dinner. Day one and two of the CNY was rather dull, only visited a few relatives and to the temples before entertaining guests at home.  Day 3 was slightly more productive, went to   Bedok Clubfitt     with  Alfian  and  Pishu  for a morning gym session before watching  Shanghai Knights  at   Tampines.     As for yesterday, it was really hard to pull myself out of bed to go camp. in camp, we spent the first half of the day hearing presentations and returning of stores from the field camp. Then after lunch, we went to a camp visit. Once we got there, I realised that we were in  Jurong Camp , the camp that  Lawrence  is in. unfortunately we were not going to where he is at, we were heading to a different section of the camp.   Today was a full day of computer based learning, so will tommorrow and Friday. Waiting for the weekend, as usual. The only motivation I have now is that my course is ending next week and there will be another public holiday and  Valentine's Day  next week too. ( trying to find courage enough to ask a certain someone out next friday) wish me luck... gtg...take carez.

      trying to make this short....have to wake up pretty early tommorrow, Finally posted to my new camp. ( Let's hope it is the last one) Wasted the whole of Friday after  Zahid  dropped me off with another guy there in the morning. Spent the time reading newspapers at the  G1  office from 10 - 5:30pm. Was acutally waiting to have an interview with some Sir. but who knows.   As For yesterday, woke up early to take a train down  Clementi . like Friday, wasted the first half of the day in another office rotting. It was until 1030am that I was brought to the MT line by one clerk. Had a quick briefing by the Staff Sergeants over there on some orientation stuff. Luckily, saw about 4 people I know over there. 1 is my Platoon pal, 1 my driver group and 2 whom i met when I was at  Sembawang . After book out, headed to HQ by train. As I reached  City Hall , saw  Katherine  boarding. So together we went to HQ, and as we were getting out of the station, we saw  Weiji, Lawrence  and another junior coming down.   After we dumped our stuff at Hq and after I changed, we both went to  PS  to have lunch at  KFC .  Eng Kee and Yong Cheng  joined us a short while later. Ate fast and went back HQ to see that the rest of the juniors ,  ALfian, Doreen Maam , Joel , Liang Yew and Andy Sirs  were there already. Started our district meeting once everyone settled down. Pretty short meeting thou,  Andy Sir  just wanted to get to know all of us and the situation of the schools and inform us about some other matters.   Alfian and me treated some of the juniors (  Yulin, Evelyn, Gisela, Chwee Ying and Eng Kee ) for a drink and bites at  Cafe Cartel .  Angeline  and some juniors from another district joined us a short while later on. Chatted about everything under the sun until about 5:30pm before we made our way. I accompanyed  Angeline  to  Parkway  first before calling  Pishu  up for a game of pool later at night.  As today, I just lazied around home until about 2:30pm when  ALfian  called me to ask me  up for another game of pool with  Pishu  and him again. Went to  East Coast Park  to play a few games before walking to  Parkway  because  Pishu  was not well. then  Alfian  and me dropped by  BK  to get a bite before he goes gym at  Bedok . That's about all for today.   okays, kooning liao....starting of a long week at my new camp... better get enough rest, esp. now with that stupid   SARS   virus going around.

      Good evening folks, had your dinner yet? well, I haven't .... waiting for DAD to come back before going to eat. Just came back from town with my sis. Met up  Angeline and Huang Chiet  & his 2 friends for a movie,   IRON LADIES 2.   It was one of those corny funny comedies. Felt the first one better. this sequel lost a bit of the originailty, not sure if they are making this up or is it for real. anyways, enjoyed the show, after that popped by  HQ  for a while because  Angeline  had to drop the pictures from Sunday's footdrill competition photos that I took. Overall, it was okay, considering I'm an amatuer.  Earlier in the morning, I went to packed my bags for booking in tonight and watched some television. Yesterday, I booked out about six. Used my duty off so that I can celebrate my mum's chinese birthday today. When I reached home, found out about the  SARS  virus and the closure of the schools up to JCs. my parents told me not to go out but I could not resist. In the end, I headed down to Bugis to meet  Lawrence and Angeline  for a drink and some snacks.  Law  was having stay out for the night. Chatted and had some  popiah and rojak . I also ate some  kaya toast . Then went back at about 10+.   Let's see .... oh ya.... Sunday!   National Footdrill comp 03   was here. Reached  HQ  at 9 to load logistics to  Police Acamedy .  Richard, Angeline, Shiwei, YunQi, Weiji and Vincent Sir  was there when i reached. drove to  PA  in the ambulance and started to prepare for the comp. More juniors arrived and all of us were busy doing our allocated jobs. As the competition drew nearer, supporters and participants started flooding in. It was a hot day and most of us got burnt. I got a line across my forehead!!!! In Short,  Jurong Sec, Victoria School and SCGS  got the   Standard Cat   prizes,  Ang Mo Kio , Victoria School and CHIJ  got the   Open Cat   prizes and  Victoria School, CHIJ and Ank Mo Kio  got the   Overall   trophies. Congrats to all of the winners and to all participating teams because they were already champions in their own districts.   As for Monday to Yesterday, I was attached to my Encik to go to   Safti MI   to assist in doing road Marshalling. spent the whole 3 days doing that. Burnt my  Nights Off on Tuesday  too. Saw the new guy replacing me as I 'm heading off to another camp tommorrow. Heading to  2 PDF  which is a reservist camp at Clementi. Heard that it is a 8 to 5 job. But it is not confirmed yet.   Okays, signing off now. Dad's back liao. take care.

Shall briefly say what were the majors happenings in the last few weeks since I last blogged.   1.)

Owe a school a treat, don't ask me how, long story ... congrats to the winning schools)  3.) Driving mileage hits 1000 km mark. ( reached a changing point in my life, hit 1000 so that means no more vehicle commander to assist , I'm all by myself now in driving.)  4.) met up some friends during my weekends and nights off for a meal. (First time, met up with Alfian and Pishu, then last Sat, met the West District gang for dinner)  5.) Had Sunday duty for the first time in camp.

      boy, how time flies by. It is already mid week , that means only 2 more days before back to camp. Sad thou but at least I'm glad that I got this much needed break. spent time with my family as well as my close friends.   Like for example, yesterday was spent totally with my sister. went to  Orchard Cineleisure  to catch 2 movies,   Taxi 3 and Willard  . both shows were great. one filled with action and comedy and one filled with suspense and horror. After the shows, went back home for a while before going out again to have dinner with some of my sister's friends. Know 2 of the 3 ladies there. the another was the cousin of my sister's friend. Went to a nearby Mexican resturant that was around the corner. atfer that , went to  siglap  for a nice waffle dessert.   As for today, woke up early to play tennis with my dad and sis. Had not touched the racket in almost 5 yrs. felt pretty rusty at first.  then in the afternoon, I went to  Pasir Ris Sec  to accredit some cadets on footdrill. Together with  Yong Cheng , we spent about 3 hours on it before we headed in our own directions. I decided to try my luck at  Tampines Mall  to watch   X MEN 2   that was opening today. Well worth the extra $2. during the show, I received a sms from  Alfian  saying that he was meeting  Pishu  at  Bedok Interchange  for supper at 9:30pm. and asked if I was interested. Immediately , I replied and went there after the show ended. Also received a sms from  Alex , my former unit's upper study. He was asking me if I wanted to join him in watching   X MEn 2   at 11:15pm. said he got to be joking becuse I was already watching it.   hjmm.....pretty late liao, tommorrow waking early to exercise again.

      Oh yeah!!! I'm back... feeling extremely good right now, the reason why? I'll on off till Saturday. That means no camp for 5 days. Using these times to rest and reculperate from last week's inspection.   hmm...  LRI  continued until last thursday where we were told that we got a grading of C. ( felt a bit sad thou because like our hard work went down the drain) Anyways, we were all anxious about getting our offs esp me. Burnt a lot of days staying back. Hope to get more than 2 days. Which now is 4 days... Hip peee!!!!!  Friday was finally spent driving the  MAN 5 tonner 16.284 Laerc . Did not drive for almost 1 month liao. Almost forget my bearings. In the morning, we drove to   Hong Kah, Lim Chu Kang, AmaKeng area, Pasir Laba Camp   and back to camp. In the afternoon, drove down to   Lentor Ave, Bedok Camp, Saf Ferry Terminal   and back to camp. Clocked up about 160km. ( that makes me hit my  2,000km  mark already,  5,000 km  more to getting license)   Saturday was mainly a  RED CROSS  day affair. in the morning, Popped down to   Pasir Ris Sec   where the school was having their annual speech day. Went there to check on things with  Yong Cheng . After that, I walked down to   Dunman Sec   to find  Chwee Ying  and  Eng Kee . when I got there, they were busy interviewing cadets to take on the new committee roles. stayed there for awhile , before  Eng Kee , some cadets and myself took cabs down to Hq. Said bye to  CY  first before we left. Managed to reach there on time. Saw  Dorlisa, Shiwei, Wendy, Pei Shan, Jianfu , Wendy, Jiayun, Elaine and Zhiwen  at Hq. There was also a lot of cadets there too.  Before we left to   Khatib Camp   for the NDP training, we had to take our as well as the cadets' temperature first as a precaution to the recent  SARS  outbreak. After that, it started to rain heavily. Tohught,  Chiem liao... I was drenched at one time.  But we finally managed to get on board the buses and down to the camp. Over there, Saw  Ekin , my Temasek Poly yr 2 friend. He was in the Air force contingent practising too. Great to see him.   Well, after the training ended and we were back at Hq,  we then swent to   Swensen's   for dinner to celebrate  Elaine's  birthday. we were joined by my 2 closest buddies  Lawrence  and  Alfian . Had a good meal with lots of conversations in between.  That's was Sat, Sunday was spent basically lazying at home in the morning, before going to buy things at  Parkway  and cycling at  East Coast  with    Alfian   . Saw  Lawrence  and his gal-friend at the end of the track before cycling back together to the rental booth.  the rest of the day was spent at Home playing  D2 .   Today, woke up late , lazied around before changing to go out for a while. Supposed to have a meeting but it was postponed. Still went down to hq thou. Saw  Doreen, Sarina, Angeline , Ee Ling and Shanne n there. Went out to   PS and centrepoint   for awhile to look at some things before heading back.  Lawrence  was to meet me there but he was tied down with work last min and could not make it.   Eng Kee  came down with the same reason I did, thinking there was a meeting. the 2 of us then joined  Angeline  for dinner at the  Cafe Cartel  at  PS . had the seafood macoroni.... very sinful...  waiting now for  Smallville  on TV... take care.

        yeah..... finally can have a break. this whole week burn hole in my wallet. All thanks to all the OT that we have to do for next monday's inspection.  Tuesday, needless to say, was a dull day at work in camp.Wednesday was  Mum's  birthday, went to  No Signboard Resturant  to have dinner. Most of my close relatives were present. Had a good say 10 - 12 course dinner, well worth the money. Thursday was spent anticipating for Friday's good friday break. Friday was here and I spent the first half of the day watching TV, then I went to  Orchard Cineleisure  to watch "  Johnny English  " with my sister. After the movie, I receive an sms from  Pishu  that  Alfian  and him were down by the foodcourt. So we went to search for them and found them having their late lunch. Drove them back after that and rest at home as today I still got to go back camp.  Today, spent most of my time finalising the paperwork that I had been tasked to do. Booked out at 530pm before reaching campsite where I saw  Mr TAn, Mr Ang, Jianfu, Eng Kee, Shiwei, Elaine, Jiayun, Peishan . they all had just finished NDP training. But I was there to find  Huang Chiet . Saw him downstairs with  Ke Ching Sir, Chee Kiat Sir, Pei Shan ( different one from upstairs) , Lynn, Wee Ting, Ming Hua, Chee Yong, Clara, David . Later on,  Peishan, David, MingHua, Chee YOng, Huang Chiet  and myself walked to  Cafe Cartel  for dinner. Spent about $130+ between the 6 of us. ( Quite ok i guess, good food comes at a high price). Walked up a bit to catch the bus 155 home after the rest took a bus to the interchange.   Tommorrow going to Beach Road to buy things and cut my hair. pretty long liao. Also need to pack my fieldpack too for MOB exercise.

      Had a tiring day today, left camp about 7pm.. my latest so far.... all thanks to the  LRI . been doing a lot of paperwork for my Staff sergeants. Hope that it will be over soon. might be sleeping early today. taking train again by myself as  Mum  got to go back to school again.   Yesterday , I almost overslept but managed to wake up in time to reach camp by 8:30am. Hate going to camp on a Sunday morning. Could have spent it better doing some exercise or spend quality time weith my family. Long time since I did that. Anyways, stayed in camp until 2 before heading home and change to go cycle. Conned my sister to join me. heee....  at night, I springclean my room a bit. threw a lot of paper and old spolit things that were accumlated in dust. Watched the   NKF show   on   Ch. 8   while cleaning up.   want to take this opportunity to tell  Law  that It's great to hear that you're discharged. rest well broz.bye!

        Took a cab back from  Clementi  after meeting the  West district people  again. It was the usual gang of  Huang Chiet, Xuan Hui, Pei Shan , Chiu Weng, Suyun, Ming Hua and Chin Kah . Went to  Sunset Way  to have steamboat for $12 per pax. The food variety was not that bad but the taste and satisfaction was not equal to the one at  Marina South .   Finished camp today at 3:30pm. Rushed back to bath and groom myself before heading to  Clementi . (    ironic is it, was from there then went home and then go back there again  .) Stuck in camp washing the vehicles for the inspection next week. Tommorrow will be also burnt until don't know what time. Haiz . so sad... what to do , army is like this. luckily it is only like this for this week (  hopefully )  Aiya,  not sure what esle to write now... let me think and then blog later. take care and good nights.

      hmmm.......been pretty busy this whole week, doing lots of paperwork and servicing in camp. All thanks to some inspection before next Friday. it is called  LRI or Logistics Readiness Inspection.  Last year, the camp got  Grade A  so in keeping up the standard , we all are working overtime. Been finishing late that these last 2 days, I had to take a cab home from camp because I was tired.   anyway, waiting for the weekend to enjoy. Most prob I will be cleaning up my room. Just got a new cupboard so I need to clear the place a bit. have to throw lots of stuff I think.   Yesterday, I got a call from both my closest buddies  Alfian and Lawrence .  ALfian  called me up  Tekong , chatted with him on what he has learnt so far . Glad that he got what he wanted. Said something about learning about the  GPMG ( general purpose machine guns) and genrades. and to do road march on the first day too. Luckily for him, I can book out this week but not next because he can't do 10 pull-ups.   ( at least he can do more than 1)     Lawrence  called me earlier in the evening. Told me something shocking. He was hospitalised because of some blood infection. The doctors worry that it is  SARS , because he started feeling unwell on last Sat and was only warded yesterday evening. the way his voice sounded on the phone hinted me that he was quite weak or feeling pretty bad. Feel like visiting him, but with this stupid outbreak thingy, I don't believe my parents would let me.So this is what I can only do and that is to tell him :  b>" Take care "broz", rest well and sleep early. Drink more water and have a good meal."     k, it's getting late. time to spilt.

      Had a pretty enriching day with some of my old sec sch buddies like  Weilun, Pishu and Alfian . Met up  Pishu and ALfian  at  Parkway  first befoore heading to  Weilun' s place. Once there, we started working out at the gym for an hour +, and then took a dip in the pool to cool off. ( ya, you all must be thinking, are you nuts, going for a swim during this virus period, well, I guess you can say so, it was so hot that it did not bothered us about the whole issue.)   After a small bath and changing session, we decided to head for the  Old Airport Road Food Centre . It was a long time since we last ate there. And boy, we did not regret our decision. We had   Chicken Cutlet, Fish and Chips, Popiah, Fried Hokkien Mee, Fried Kway Teow, Ice Kachang, Ice Jelly and Sugarcane juice   between the 4 of us.   Feeling very satisfied and bloated, we took a bus down to  Beach Rd  where  Weilun and Alfian  went to buy some army stuff. This place was pretty packed, maybe it was due to the fact that many people are going to  SISPEC  and new units tommorrow.   When we were done, we decided to dump our stuff at home first before meeting up again at  Parkway  for a drink.  Weilun  reached first , followed by me and then  Pishu  and lastly  Alfian  ( Miscomm with him and he went to the wrong place, poor guy) Alf went to buy a new shirt first before we went to  Cold Storage  to buy some drinks, in the end, we ended up window shopping at  Parkway  until we saw  Angeline  outside  GIANT . went in to see see look look and when I came out, I spent about $40 buying things for my bike.   Okays, better rest now, waking up early again to go camp.

      Yo!, Just back from town,   Heeren Marche   to be precise... had dinner with the   West District Kakees   of the following usual suspects:  Xuanhui, Chiu Weng, Pei Shan, Ming Hua, Siyun, Chin Kah, Chee Yong and Jack .    Chiu Weng   had asked me earlier if I wanted to join him and the rest for dinner to celebrate 3 of the juniors' birthdays. Ate lots of food and drinks as well as took lots of photos and chatted about some old times. Marche   was packed but not as packed as before, maybe due to the  SARS   virus. However, there were still quite a number of people were eating over there. Oh ya, when we were there, we saw   Glenn Ong, Jaime Yeo of the radio station 98.7fm the Perfect 10 and Elaine Chien of the Fame Awards   eating there too.  Boy, am I full, luckily tommorrow going over   Weilun's   place to exercise a bit together with   Alfian  . Speaking of whom is going to   SISPEC   on monday. All the best and don't try to break a leg, you shall suffer. Will be missing him because he will be at   Tekong  or another 5 months or so...   Met   Alfian and Jim   up at   East Coast   this afternoon to cycle. But before we even cycle, I was blessed by a higher being. Kena bird dropping on my cap and shirt... What luck, told my mother should buy 4 D , tonight sure come out first prize. After cleaning up, we cycled almost the whole of  East Coast   for an hour + before we headed back and I left the 2 of them at the bus stop.   Alright, sleeping early to wake early tommorrow. Nights

      Finally, the weekend is here!!!!!!!!   but cannot enjoy just yet, still got to head back camp tommorrow. After that, maybe will call up  "bro"  up and see if he finished getting his posting. And ask  what are his plans for the afternoon. Was actually thinking of asking the juniors out for a meal cum cycling at  East Coast  or a meal cum movie at either  Tampines  or town. Don't think many of them will say yes because of the virus outbreak. No harm trying thou. Shall open up to some of the  West District  kakees like  Shiwei, Dorlisa and XuanHui  , etc.... long time since we caught up on things.   Just finished my bath, Boy , feel so refreshed.... shall surf the net for a while before watching some TV. Luckily for tommorrow, can book-in in admin attire( PT attire). oh, time to surf liao.. keep in touch.

      Can't wait for the weekend...... been coopped up in camp for the whole week doing nothing much except some "free labour". Just heard that another person died of  SARS , the fifth one. Heard also that  SIM  is closing for a week too. Is it that bad?   Here one quote i like to put; was actually SMS-ed by my bro  Alfian  not long ago.    " Missing you is what i always do, forgetting me is totally up to you, forget me never, i miss you forever. Forget this message but not the SENDER. "     Meaningful ain't it? simple yet emotional.   It's that time of the night again, time to jiao...Bye!

      What a week I had. let me tell you more.  Starting from last,last Saturday, woke up super ewarly to reach camp to report for my detail, had to drive some officers to cover reservists' range at  Pasir Leba CAmp . finished camp only at about 9pm that night.   Sunday was spent relaxing at  Sentosa's Siliso Beach  where  Xuan Hui  had invitied a few friends and me along to celebrate her 21st birhday. that will be the only rest I will be having for about 1 week.  Chiu Weng, Alfian, Huang Chiet , JAck, Pei Shan, Chin Kah, Chee Yong, Ming Hua, Suyun, Shiyin  also came. Also saw  Wendy and Khian Sim and Wei Qiang Sir  on that day too at different locations.  Monday was another long day as I went to  Pasir Laba     again to be a reservist CO driver. Ended up late almost close to midnight when I reached camp.  Tuesday till Friday was spent on exercise. Was driving the safety rover so clocked up a lot of mileage about 500+km. Went to places like  Ponggol , Seletar, Paya Lebar Airbase and Yishun . This started the beginning of something bad. Actually reached camp early sat morning , say 2am, and told my colleague that i was going to report sick. So I went back home and rest first. but then , he called me up about 6am to say that I was to report sick in camp. Haiz what to do, had to go. Reported sick for some body rashes, blocked nose and some backache. the MO just gave me some running nose medicine and a bottle of calamine lotion. the rest of the day was alright. Even went to meet  Alfian and Xuan Hui  for a while.  Peishan  joined us later when we went to  Mdm Wong at Mohammad Sultan  for some drinks. took a cab back after that. But thruoghtout the whole night, I couldn't sleep. my whole body was itching. when I woke, I found out that my body was covered with lumpy heat rashes from shoulder to thighs. argh! so itchy, used a no. of creams to try ease the suffering but it was no use. Worse of all, yesterday evening, i developed a temperature and was shaking quite badly. Luckily  now the fever is gone but the rashes remain.  Came from camp not long ago,  saw the MO again, and he gave me an MC for 2 days. so now resting at home......haiz, what a week... be back later

      Hurray!, the weekend's here. Sad thou that I still got to go back camp tommorrow. Oh well, at least I rested well these 2 days.  Wednesday passed without much difficulty.( maybe it's because Thursday was a holiday ). And ya, I took my time to reach home on Wednesday. decided to see how long it took if I took bus 14 back. and guess what I found out, It took  1HOUR and 20 MINS . luckily had my dinner before I boarded.  Thursday was spent sleeping in the morning, followed by a trip to  Marine Parade's Best Denki  where I bought a new CD-tape-radio player for my grandparents who is celebrating their diamond weeding anniversary. Hope they liked it. Had dinner at   Paramount hotel  , my grandparents' favourite place to eat.  As for today, I met up with  Huang Chiet  to search for a present for a close friend of ours,  Xuan Hui , who is celebrating a milestone this Sunday. She is turning 21 and was so kind to invite us to go  Sentosa  to chiong. In the end, we ended up buying more things. I bought a cute toy turtle to add to my collection,  Huang Chiet  bought a new pair of sunshades and a swiss army knife. then we bought  Xuan Hui  a swiss army knife too, like the one  Huang Chiet  just got. After that we bought a pair of dolls for  Shannen  as a belated birthday gift. we ended the day by buying some cake and sushi back to  HQ  to share with the rest. I left after that to get my hair trim. It had been irrittaing me the whole week, so was pretty satisfied with the results.   On a more personal issue, this month thou it is only mid way thru, it has make me think on a lot of things affecting me recently.  Things like my studies / carreer after army. esp since I am almost left with 1 more year. What should I take? Where should I go? Should I go overseas or stay in Singapore?  Another question is on money, thou I just been promoted and will be getting an increase in allowance soon, it will not be enough still to cover my daily / weekly expenses. Transport and food cost me a lot recently. I was even thinking should i take a job after army first before studying.  lastly, and this is quite personal, and it is my love life. Thou I am not in any relationship or seeing anyone, I admit, i feel like i have feelings for someone. problem is i dare not tell her yet as I am not that close to her yet. Also, i got a friend, whom I shall not mention, who knows of my situation as he is in the same boat. his problem thou is that his cat is out of the bag thanks to his camp friends and the (girl)friend in question is giving him the cold shoulders now. i wish him all the best and pray to myself not to get into this mess too.   okays, feeling slighty relieved now that I poured most of the things out. Somethings I am still keeping to myself as it is rather sensitive.   before I go, time to say birthday greetings to 2  kakkess ,  Eng Kee  ( 17 ) and  Xuan Hui  ( 21 ). enjoy yourselves and I keep in touch.

      yeah, I'm finally back from my last duty of the month. thou I have one more standby, it is not as bad as the last 2. the reason, it is simple , they were on weekends.  On Sunday, I thought I was just going to shake leg in camp, Who know suddenly I had to go to send a warrant officer to  Jurong Island . spent almost the whole morning and afternoon there.   Luckily for yesterday, they did not put me on detail. So was basically doing maintenace work on the vehicle and checking on the store. As for today, I came early to camp because I was told that I was to be re access my mini bus, in the end NO. After that, I wasted time waiting for a detail going to  Lim Chu Kang  which ended at about 7pm.   hmm.... Oh yes, Today is a friend's birthday. Yo  Ms Teo Shannen , Happy sweet Birthday. ( shall not say her age... let her have piracy) Speaking of special occassions, got  4 more coming up this few days. 1 is my junior  Eng Kee's  birthday, 1 is my friend  Xuan Hu i's birthday ( by the way, she invitied me and a few others to  Sentosa  this Sunday... cannot wait to enjoy) then I still got my parents' and grandparents' wedding aniversaries to go thru.   shall post more nonsense on Vesak Day. more time to ponder on some things recently.  signing off now.

      Another day passed just like that, is that fast? It means another day closer to my special day.   Been preparing for it this whole week. Went to buy stuff, inviting my friends over, etc... Well, it may seem ordinary for someone to celebrate his birthday in a chalet, but to me, it is a significance. It is my first 2 _ birthday that I am celebrating in a chalet, missed my significance 21st birthday last year because I was enrolled in Tekong just 2 days before the big day.   Today also marks the milestone that I'm half way through my NS service. as usual, it is going to be a short blog. still got my habit of sleeping before 11pm.  adios amigo

      Just back from some shopping with my Mum and Sis at   Parkway  . Went down to start buying things for my chalet which is on the weekend. Hope most of my kakees turn up. Sad thou that Law called me to say he can't. He will be going overseas for training and is not sure when he is returning.   Friday was a dull day in camp as usual. Was still recovering from my duty. The weekend brought many 1st to me again.  Had my first exernal healthy lifestyle run at  Marina South Park . After much , I went to HQ for NDP and received my first NDP tee.  Was also my first time watching the rehearsal at the grandstand at one time with the rest of the juniors. Encountered my first live sabo with cadets with my   ex Hougang   cadets and   Mr Ang.   He was so excitied that he dropped his Hp and it was spolit. felt so bad. Left HQ as fast as I could after the debrief as I had a super early detail to  Macritchie  Res. at about 4+am. Luckily for sunday, I  finished early andI reached home about 11am. Popped down again  to HQ to help out in accrediting the new VIs casualty evacuation. Had  Swensens  for dinner with my   East Juniors and Angeline  .   Yesterday, made my third trip to  HQ  in as many days, for a meeting . Went to  Cafe Cartel  with   Shannen, Eng Kee and Angeline   once the rest of them left. talked about a lot of stuff.

      Boy, time files when you don't notice it. the days are beginning to move faster and the weekend is always coming nearer.   Had my first duty of the month yesterday and it was terrible. it is a long story which I would like to keep short. Just that I had only 3 hours plus of sleep the whole night.   Sorry to all , but as of late, I am really too tired / lazy to read long messages. So please bear with me.   Will be waiting for the end of the month. because of a special day.

      The weekend is almost over, this week like any other weekend was dedicated to one of my loves,   Red Cross  . After a hectic day in camp yesterday, I took a cab down from camp to the  National Stadium  to join  Mr Ang, Khim Sim, Dorl, Shiwei, Elaine, Zhiwen, Peishan , Jiayun and Eng Kee . Saw  Ekin  over there too, but he looked very tired.  We stayed over at the  Stadium , training till about 6pm before waiting for the bus to bring the cadets back to  HQ . Once there, some debrief and admin was done together with the distribution of the T-shirts that they will get for free. I will be getting one soon next week. We had dinner at  PS' Pastamania  and then took a train to campsite.  a few of us stayed overnight there because we were having a course. pretty ok, except that when it came to some practical, it was really bad for some commands. esp. things like slow march and parade procedures. well, at least not that bad for someone who has not een doing footdrill for almost 1 year. been busy driving here and there.  Must really thank  Mr Andrew Ong  and Roy Sir  for guiding us.   It's time again. preparing for tommorrow and for my medical apointment at  CGH  for my follow up.

      Just back from   Parkway   not long ago, went there to buy some things, which included something that I been longing for but quite scared to buy before. And that is a  Pair of Contacts !!!!!... Yes, started wearing contact lenses liao, trial period now for a week. feels a bit odd at least , uneasy at sometimes but it is ok. Before   Parkway  , I had gone down to   Changi General Hospital   for a medical checkup on my rashes that caused me some trouble back then. Left camp at about 2+ and had my late lunch by the interchange. Met  Mum and Dad  for the appointment. Earlier on, I started my first day as temp clerk. Was pretty ok, with the exception hiccups now and then. But I clarified it with  Terence , the clerk.   As for yesterday, the highlights of the day was having lunch with my grandparents, my sister and my cousin at   Miramar Hotel  . Boy, I had a good meal there, had over 20+ types of dishes to choose from. The next highlight was in the evening, met my parents and sister at   Suntec CIty   to watch  Finding Nemo . And it was a great show. A lot of scenes / situation seemed so relatable. It showed the strength of persistance, the willingness of striving to achieve a goal,  as well as things like don't judge a book ( or in this case, a fish) by its cover and how friendship means sacrificing oneself to help one another. It is definately a good moral tale.  Finally, Saturday. I was both happy and sad. Happy because I finished camp extremely early like 9:30am. then I rushed down to   HQ   for  NDP . as quite early, but saw that  Peishan and Elaine  were there already. the other juniors came in later on , one by one.  Jiayun,Dorlisa, Shiwei, Wendy, Jianfu, Zhiwen, Eng Kee  . we were going down for our first stadium training. It lasted until late in the evening about 8:30pm. After which, we had a small debrief and supper of   Macdonalds   to follow.   Now here comes the sad part, I learnt that  Warren Sir  was not well and hospitalised. Also learnt that for the next training, there was not going to be a senior officer around.  Mr Ang  was going for reservists. Then, I sort of sprain my left ankle because of all the walking with my shoes and that we had the highest no. of casualties for Sat. the highest for us so far.   Alright, getting late, need to pack my stuff. Also will be taking a long time to take out my lenses. I took me about 10 mins to out it on. was glad that the optician was patience enough.  ;P

      I think this is going to be a trend soon for me, posting blogs about once in every 1-2 weeks. Felt pretty sick, tired , lazy to post recently. Furthermore, there is a lot of things that has been going on for me. this will be an extremely long post for your information.   like any of my postings, shall start first with my daily happenings.  Was on 2 days MC till 27th. spent most of the time resting, watching TV and using the computer. 28th, went back to camp, not fully recovered yet. Ended up still doing all the dirty servicing and maintenance work. Did those type of work for the next 2 days too, only drove once for a re-orientation on the minibus. This means that I can soon go back to  Pasir Ris  and find  Alex  again. Did duty on Thursday night. then on Friday night, after work, I went to hq for a meeting with some of my juniors,  Serene, Yong Cheng and Fahmi  for an upcoming event.  As for last Sat, Went to camp for the weekly walk, after which I just lazied around for the rerst of the morning. Took a shower after reaching home before going to  Parkway  to buy a computer game which I had been eyeing for a long long time. bought a few more items before heading back. spent the rest of the evening playing my new game,   Championship MAnager 4  .   Sunday was also spent at home, having lunch with my parents and sister and basically rotting at home with the computer again.  Monday was spent as the first day of the MTL Clerk's understudy. This is because he is going for  BMTC  recourse. Learnt lots of things during these few hours. pretty stressful in a way.  Thought that Tuesday was going to be the same as Monday, in the end, I was last minute asked to drive a minibus to  Bedok Camp . The whole day was "wasted" driving to places like  MINDEF, CMPB, Mandai Camp, Bedok Camp  and back to  Clementi . Clocked up about 190km for 1 day. Not too bad. Then in the evening, I went to  Plaza Singapore  to meet  Eng Kee, Gisela, Evelyn and Chwee Ying  for dinner before heading down to HQ for a district meeting.  Fahmi, Chee Keong, Huda, Liying, Doreen, Serene, JAsper, Joel and Andy Sirs  were there too. the meeting lasted only for an hour plus.  Andy Sir  just wanted to find out about the current situation down at the schools esp with the SARS outbreak going on.   As for Wednesday till Today, I was back at understudying the clerk.I however was sad because I gained 3 extra duties for some lousy reasons which I shall not say, the day passed with  less interuptions this time round. Tommorrow be the start of my replacement duty as a temp clerk. Hope I fair alright. I actually wanted to blog earlier but my stupid computer crashed on me.  Poor me, all my data is lost as I had o reboot the whole computer. Taught myself a good lesson in saving backup. things from important Red Cross Docs, to my Digital Pictures are all gone. I was trying to help  Alfian  burn a CD of the system32 file but the computer hanged halfway. then when i restarted, it said that some programe was missing.   I think I shall post more personal emotions building up inside me another day, I need to pack my bag for tommorrow's NDP at the stadium. Shall try to post on Sunday.

      Was reading in today's issue of  The NEW PAPER  about some JC students and blogging. Quite intrigued by it. Saw the part on what an expert said about blogging and I could not agree more with what he said. according to him, people feel better after blogging because it is like a whole load of burden has been just relieved off someone's shoulders.   Today , I had problems with my printer in camp. The cartidage run out of ink and a colleague of mine and myself were battling with the silly thing to refill it. In the end, we succeeded but there were casualties of " war " , my table, a lot of paper and our hands were all stained black. even after several washes, my hands are still black.   Just checked thru my stuff and found that  Shiwei  finally created her blogspot. Already visited the site and gave her her first feedbacks. ;P The midweek point has passed and don;t you feel that this year seemed to be movong faster than last yr? It has reached the end of July and Aug is popping out soon. NDP is only 13 days away and I'm excitied over that big day. Really looking forward for the parade and see how the cadets fare.    Ending soon, Just wanted to part with this pharse. taken of another popular song, "  WORDS  " by the  Bee Gees    " It's only words and words are all I have to take your heart away. "

      As I am typing this blog, I'm listening to the radio. to the songs of yesteryears ,the songs that I used to hear when I was a young boy growing up. Like the song from the  Carpenters  "  Yesterday Once More  ", which is a all-time favourite of mine, I used to listen to the radio , waiting for my favourite songs, and when they played, I sing along. Tuned to  Gold 90.5fm . Just realised that they played such nice songs in this time of the night. with less talking.   Currently online on  MIRC  too, talking to a Red Cross junior of mine whom I known for almost 5 years already since she was sec 1. Facing some problems with her family and can't commit to schs for the time being. Was pretty worried for her as we ( my fellow volunteers) had not been able to contact her since late Apr. Anyways, it is such a relieve to hear from her again. No need to worry already.   As for camp today, it was the opposite of yesterday. I could even have time to go to  E-Mart  to buy a new brush and ziplocks. Managed to clear a bit of my outstanding stuff thou I still got another halfway more to go. Would like to thank  Angeline  for visiting the page. Do visit often.  Also would like to tell  Dorl  abt the suggestion abt the bbq on the 8th Aug, stay more at hq of not all will have no strength the next day. like wat  EK  said, we shld open invitation to the trainers and marshallers and if possible,  Mr Tan ? but i think he shld be resting at home.   time to run. bye...

      It's 9:30pm already, time passed by so fast. Was back from camp like only 2.5 hours ago...  Thought today was going to be a super lag day. In the end , I was running to places to and fro umpteen times. The only consolation for today was a good long cab ride home from  Clementi . Slept for a while on board. Was still very latagit ( hope the spelling is right) from the weekend's  RCY  involvments. Passed a roll of film to  Sis  to get it developed. Wonder how's the pictures will turn out. Another thing good was the fact that our camp has step down the   SARs   measures, meaning no need to take temperature while booking in and out.   Anyway, back to camp today. I was told to usher in 3 new Malay drivers to the  MT Line . Finally got drivers coming in. We were in need of drivers esp during this Ops period. Most of the drivers are working double time and I pity them . I have a slight advantage now because I am a dual vocationist for a while.    will be watching "  Friends  " soon.  betta check my mails first.   Oh ya , to freddy, "   Thanks for putting up the pictures, and dun worry my next target to chase will be Dorl  "

      Wah... can bearly keep my eyes open... had an extremely tiring 2 days. Came back from Tunch with  Angeline, Huang Chiet, Chee Yong , Siyun, Xuanhui  at  Sento Japanese  resturant at Cuppage. Earlier on, we all were in one way or another involved in the   Singapore     Youth Festival's Hertiage Trail  . The starting point was at  Marina Promeade , under the Sheares Bridge. The place was packed with a lot of people. So many officers from other UGs, of which, I saw  Wayne , my younger cousin. Anyway, I decided last night at I wanted to take some pictures for the event as part of some collection I am creating. so I went back to bath and stayed over at HQ after   NDP  's debrief last night.   For this week, I was playing a rather "babysitter" role, spent the whole afternoon in the  Singapore Indoor Stadium  lookinmg after the reserves as well as the cadets' goodie bags. Luckily,  Pei Shan  was there to accompany so I did not felt bored so much. Also saw an old volunteer in the RSAF GOH contingent. Was pretty impressed by the way he looked in this No. 1 uniform. Heard that this week, the cadets was not up to par and there was a certain problem about tickets that made most of us unhappy with the contingent. Next week will be a normal training with the components drills however all of us have to report like the last 2 weeks, starting early and ending late.   the sky is very threatening right now over at my place. Looks like going to be a thunderstorm. Good thing I'm indoors and in a need for a rest. Will be packing my bag and Uniform for camp soon. and then start a small nap.    This is to be the start of a new work week. that means 51/2 days to Enjoyment again. Think it will pass fast like the weeks before thou. I hope

      Done packing my things for tommorrow. Will be bringing my full U down to camp. which I think it is receive many stares by my specs and colleagues. Going for  Healthy Lifestyle  finally after 1 month. last few weeks had been tasked drive on Sats so missed the walk/run.  Heard that my  MTO  went to report sick this afternoon while i was out, so i don't think he will be coming in tommorrow. Praying that we get early dismissal so that i can reach   NDP   before 2pm. It the  Preview  meaning we are inching closer to the actual event on Aug 9. We have experience the good and bad during these past few months, getting to know everyone much better, esp the  Army Marshallers  like  Freddy .  Just got a SMS from  Alfian  , asking me what am i  doing tommorrow. Told me that his mum and sis are going for the  Preview . maybe i should ask him to tell them to comment on the contingent's performance. So how their morale was boosted from last week by a comment from one of our senior Officers,  Mr Andrew Ong .   Finishing soon, want to addd one more thing toady and that is another saying.   "  Success is not measured by the heights you attain but by the obstacles you overcome  "   Another good example to tell the cadets tommorrow. Some of them were upset that they are not in the contingent and were in the reserves. But they should wonder, they have already come so far , lasted almost 4 months of trainings, countless no. of hours of practising the umbrella drills. These sacrifices and obstacles did not stop them did they? they overcame them and are relishing the fact that they are the " honoured " few to be involved in  NDP2003 . There were no losers, only winners.   ok.ending here to catch up on my beauty sleep for it's a long day ahead.

      Oh my! it is getting late.. let me just do a short blog. Today in camp, I was very busy in the morning till abt 3pm doing all the admin work.  MTO  suddenly made me do a lot of stuff. bah! Only could rest during lunch and after 3. but was tasked again to go  Changi Airport  to return vehicle. Managed to reach back just before roll call. took the train down to  Dhoby Ghaut  while I had dinner at  Pizza Hut  wif Eng  Kee, Huda, Yong Cheng, Doreen and Alvin . After dinner, proceeded to  HQ  and met  Eddie and Chee Keong . Had a pretty fast meeting, discussed all the final details. Sidetracked here and there until 930pm. Boarded the train again to reach home.   Luckily, tmr no detail so can take my time to rest. This week,  like any other, I feel is passing by very fast. you say?   shall leave you with this ending  message. "   You cannot light a fire in another soul unless it is burning in your own soul  " I think this can be put into use in the context of my volunteering with the  Red Cross .What abt you? what do you think? Found on  urlLink www.thoughts.com . a place with good quotes,messages and other phrases. do visit it. gd nights

       bah!....  I'm very irritated. My nose is like a river flowing non stop this whole day. Was sneezing and dripping in the morning, then in the afternoon the sneezing stopped for a while before coming back in the evening. Just took 2 tablets to ease the dripping. Know it may sound disgusting but what to do, my nose won't cooeperate wif me. Had to even buy a hand towel to act as my hankie.   Anyway, managed to catch the  MAN UTD vs Celtic  Match on TV at the MT Line. most of my specs were watching it during lunchtime. I stopped at the halftime where Man Utd were leading 3-0. pretty one-sided .   Also went to   Maju camp, 1 PDF   today to collect Land Rovers together with my SSGs. After we got back, I was suddenly tasked to go   Changi Police division   to send vehicle there to replace a breakdown vehicle. Took me 45mins to reach there as traffic was slow due to rush hour. Went to T1 to have an early dinner before taking the bus back home.   Trying to do upload my pics now, but uploading it is taking so long. argh!!!!  yeah... medicine feeling kicking in... gtg n recuperate ..... if it is not better, going to report sick tmr.  take care all. seeya soon.

      The weekend passed by Just like that. rested well even to meet  Pei Shan, Lawrence, Suyun and Angi  at   CityLink's Pacific Coffee  . Saw  Sis  and my cousin  Renee  at   Raffles City   when I went to changed. Chatted and talked all the way from 7+ to almost 10 without drinking or eatting much. After  Law  accompanied the 2 juniors home ,  Angi  and I went to find  Sis  who was at   Marina Sq  . took the bus back and bought some food back to eat. was my first meal and drink in almost 10 hours. Reached home about 11+ and slept at 12.  So Sleepy that I almost did not want to get up. Just got on the MRT in time to board the ferry bus to camp. Was a quite dull day in camp doing admin. Did not haf any details recently, which was a gd thing. made me concentrate on my work.   Just visited  some of my friends' blog like  Freddy . And I got this to say to him, "  the Flashes are so cute....."  Just added my  sis'  webbie too and will be uploading some pictures soon. Just bear with it.

      Just woke up abt 2 hours ago.... physically exhausted after yesterday's   NE SHOW  . Woke up early yesterday to reach  Bedok Camp  at 5:30am. After loading up some stores, we were on our way to  Marina . Unfortunately, it statrted to rain and all were quite happy because that means external run would be cancelled. However, GOd was just playing with us and when we reached  Marina , it stopped raining. The run continued but it finished fast.( good news for us) Parked the vehicle back at  Bedok camp  before rushing back. had a quick shower and lunch after which Mum dropped me off at  Stadium .   the cadets and instructors had just finish their lunch when i saw them. Proceeded in having their component training at abt 1+ under a suddenly humid weather. Went back to  SIS  at about 3pm to rest and wait for early dinner. As expected dinner was  KFC . but no one except  Shiwei  was complaining. think she getting chelat of eating chicken everyweek liao. Had to enforce the cadets after dinner again because we were still taking their timing in doing things.  Freddy  then took the contingent back to the  Stadium  for the actual Show. It was crowded and very noisy. saw  Nicky, Mr Andrew Ong, Wilson, Stephen and Keng Lum Sir  over there too.   Unable to get in to stadium this time around due to security reasons but accordiing to sources, the cadets did a good job. ( Bravo cadets, keep it up)   Quickly gathered back all the cadet's umbrellas, took their temperature and collected all the food boxes and rushed to the buses. saw the Fireworks on the way home. Simply spectacular. shld haf seen it. Back at the debrief, we were first entertained by Birthday babies of the contingent and from what i seen, we got another "   Law and Alf style comedians  " in the squad. Had Supper with  Elaine, Jianfu, Peishan and Eng Kee  at   Mos Burger  . Saw  chia Her , a driver from  Pasir Ris camp  whom ORD already working there. Great to see him. Finally took a bus back with  Eng Kee  on a sleepy journey.   Today , will try to rest and tidy my super messy room. Mum had complained to me already, which is not good. So better get some tidy-ing done. Having lunch soon, wonder wat's for lunch. hmm.... Thinking also shld i go to  Parkway  to buy some things... see how... gtg n take a bath liao..

      Had a busy day today compared to yesterday. HAd been on my toes since this morning. Orientated 1.5 ton by my spec for a last min change in detail for tmr's external run. Drove to  Bedok Camp  to report.  Affendi  was there already. Waited there for the RSM to turn up , had a short briefing for the run. After that, I went to the hawker opp the camp to buy  Cheng Tng, satay and Goreng Pisang  back for my family.   Tmr got to wake up super early, say 4:30am to reach the camp in an hour's time. Going to haf to trouble my sis to send me there. After which, i will be rushing here and because it is the  NE Show  at the  National Stadium . hope the cadets will do their best. and pray the weather is gd to them and no casualty.   Saturday going to burn out for me like all Sats before. And Sunday will be there for me to recuperate. Hee....thinking shld i bring my camera? have not downloaded my pictures from last rehearsal. not sure if val has already charge the camera. one way to find out.   kays... will let you know more of tmr's happenings on Sunday.

      hmm... i think i can summarize today in one or two words. they are  QUIET  and  LAZY  Day. Because most of my specialist s are either on off, duty or leave...  Making the whole   MT Line   so quiet that it makes us kinda lazy to do work... hahaha... long time since this happened. Anways. Most of work was completed yesterday so i shld be able to manage tmr.   Lost for words to write today. eyes feeling very tired. Saw tmr's detail and was one of those who had to help in preparing for Sat's external run. Packed my things for  NDP  too just in case. Going to be 1 long day ahead.   a thought to ponder upon. and it comes from a famous song; "  If a picture paints a thousand words, now why can't i paint you ..."  You cannot put a price for a special moment of your life. treasure every one of them even if you dun think they mean anything to you. For it may be something to someone esle.

      Listening to the radio as I am doing this blog, quite a nice song playing currently, "   No me amos"   by  J Lo and Marc Anthony . Liked the way it is done in Spainish. Another song i liked in Spainish is "  Purest of Pain  ".  Anyway, as the title says, I had a pretty much fruitful day at work/camp. Managed to settle a lot of admin work which had been piling up. Got the serviceperson to fixed the copier; got the claims back; done my bus indents and my parade states. Heard that this Sat is going to haf external run at  Marina South  again. hope it ends early so that I can rush to  NDP . Going to be the  NE Show , hope the cadets do their best. and that their discipline is gd. It is tiring on us to always scold them for the same reasons. Not tt we like to scold for fun. they are mature enough to know this. Hope to take some more good pictures like  urlLink this  too. Also found out that my  Comd day  is on the same day as  Infoquiz . may not be able to help out in the event liao. must see how.   However, the night before was not as good. After watching "   10 things i hate abt you"   on  ch 5 . I thought I was going to sleep well. But thru out the whole night, i became tossing and turning. Suddenly felt so itchy, started stratching everywhere but it got worse. Went to apply powder on the red areas. As well as some anti rash cream. that only helped a bit. Felt so tired that almost did not want to go to work. Cannot report sick because if i do, then there will be no one to look after the bus matters. Had to just bear with it.   No details tmr so can concentrate again on my admin work again. tt is gd news. Only thing now stopping me is that I am sharing 1 computer with abt 7 people. So must fully make use of the time i haf to do my work. gd nights folks!

      reblogging this now... hope that this time around there is no hiccups.  So let's start from Friday, After camp, took the train to   Dhoby Ghaut  . Went to meet my juniors for dinner at   Plaza Singapore's Long John Silvers  . Saw more than expected people there.  Dorl, Angi, Nicky, Alvin, Joshua, had joined Huda, Eng Kee , Yong Cheng and Dor  for dinner too. Had a quick meal thou because we all wanted to end the mtg early. Saw  Jasper  at the mtg rm when we reached back hq. Underwent a long discussion on the preparations for the  Infoquiz , which is slowly coming up. Ended at 10+ and rushed to get back home as I had camp and  NDP  the next day.   Saturday came, and I was quite excitied. because it is my favourite day of the week.  NDP  trgs!!!! So glad that I was able to book out early and quickly took a cab to meet the rest at the   S'pore Indoor Stadium  . When I reached, I saw tt they were practising their wheeling, something that they had to improve a lot on.   Once they finished the practise and 1 round of the sequence run, we were back at the   SIS   for early dinner. Remembering of what happened last week and the fact that most of the instructors were exhausted due to sch, work, camp, We came down hard on discipline during dinnertime. Started the ball rolling by telling that they move with their feet and hands and not by their mouth. After tt,  Dorl, Shiwei and Jianfu  followed suit. ( it was a good thing too that we were at an enclosed area, so our telling offf was much more ampflied.)  Things turned out slightly better later on as moods improved and all of us were in a cheering mood. the cadets cheered for and with the other UGs even on the way back hq.  The debrief took a while but soon all of us went our separate ways and I went to meet  Angi and Law  , who were together with the  West District gang . they were enjoying life ast   City link's pacific coffee  . Had came back from Marriot Hotel for the annual  Promotion and Awards ceremony . ( Congrats to all my fellow instructors, juniors and seniors alike, congrats on your well deserved promotion.)  Found out that  Law and Angi  still wanted to have a drink so we went to  SIS ( ya, again) for a drink. chatted abt RC stuff and other matters until 2am. reached back and straight to bad.   Woke only at 9am on Sunday, Watched some TV until lunch time. Had Lunch and felt so tired still tt I went to bed again. Woke again at 7pm. and went to eat again ( just like a pig ar..... hhahaah)slept again at 10+ after watching " WHO M I"  on Ch 8.   Monday ; reached camp at 530 because I had an early detail. only to discover tt the Sir only wanted to move off at 8+. ( Argh!... could have an hour more of sleep) well, wat to do? in camp... shld haf expected this.  the rest of the day went by doing admin work.  Today, heard from my colleague tt one of the new drivers doctored his MC and was gonna get charge. luckily he only got  SOL . so count himself lucky. Went to  JI and Macritchie  for details. Saw a big accident on the way back, involving abt 4 lorries. oh man, traffic was so slow and stretched till so far back.   One good news for this week to share with you all is that my 3,000km claim is finally processed and I'll be getting $150.00 more next mth. nice n'tl day gift ar...  kays. will stop here. think enough for you to digest for today.

      Had a nice bath.... feeling slightly more refresh now. Finished camp ok pretty late. Went to  Changi Airport  to send some reservists to see the place for their in camp soon.The detail to  Jurong Island  was cancelled because they suddenly needed a minibus driver.  Left camp about 3+ and reached back abt 7pm. took a cab back but had too wait so so long time for one cab.   Mum bought chicken rice, was so hungry that it tasted so good. When asked where she bought it, she replied at the  Old Airport Rd  hawker centre. near my old secondary school. Currently trying to load some pictures onto my old webpage which it is still in progress.   Should be sleeping quite early again today, don't know why these few weeks me suddenly feel so tired. Cannot be work, because I could still managed. Maybe it is the hot weather. Heard that it can affect one's physic.

      hmm... just to add on from what happened just now. Was orientated a  pickup  and the  GP Car  by my senior spec in the afternoon. Went to places like  Changi Airport and even Jurong  area respectively. passed by my friends' schools and homes i think. Anyway, still got a detail to  Jurong Island  . good thing that it is in the afternoon. At least got an hour more to sleep.   Saw a rainbow on the way back home when my sis picked me up from the MRT.  It had been a while since i last saw one.   finished playing  CM4  for today, currently checking my emails before logging off. will be uploading my   NDP   pictures i took soon. Just waiting for my photo editer programme to be installed into the computer , and I'm ready to get things going.   ok, time's up for me again... adios!

      What a day, practically dragged myself out of bed today because I was totally exhausted from yesterday's full day activities. Luckily , I did not have any details today. So i slowly went ahead to do my administrative work that had been piling up constantly. Finally managed to endorse my 3,000km claim. so that means will be richer by $150.00 by next month i hope.   Yesterday, we finished at hq at about ten + and add the time i needed to pack my things and wash up, I slept just after midnight.  NDP  training was different yesterday because our holding area was the  Singapore Indoor Stadium  and man was it crowded. took some pictures with my dad's digital camera , unfortunately, I realised that the resolution was extremely big. wait until I'm doneeditting the pictures before showing  to one and all. the cadets were also treated to ice cream too. and their lunch looked slightly better compared to the previous meetings. Casualty level was still a concern but luckily there was not many to panic about. As the days start to go by, the ever daunting actual day is getting nearer. only left with 1 more rehearsal before the  NE Show. Preview and the actual day  . the cadets have gone a long way. Some of them have bonded together, going thru the thick and thin in the trainings.   Before I met them by the stadium, I was driving at  East Coast . Was the safety rover to take charge for the weekly AHM external run. was telling my colleague that I was so close and yet so far.  aturday was spent doing admin work in the morning and driving to Juring Island in the  afternoon.  what a way to spend your weekend. Got used to it thou but still irritated by the fact.  Friday was my second duty of the week but my first for the new month. Actually thought that it might remind quiet  but who knows that suddenly I had to drive to  LTA  off  Bukit Timah . my first time over there but i had a rough idea on where it was in the first place.  This whole week was really a physical and mental draining session with myself. Did not have enough of sleep for the last few days. like what I am doing now. I'm sleep writing.. ok.. that is my clue. will be back ....

      Finally booked out early for once this few weeks. Managed to reach home by 630pm. Just packed my things for tommorrow's duty. Kinda  sian  already because of what has been going on lately in camp. Missed my previous unit at   Pasir Ris  . Anyway, I guess I have to bear with it for another 348+ days more at   Clementi  .   Received a surprise SMS from  Evelyn  wishing me a belated birthday.(  yeah.... really really belated ) Appreciated thou , it means that at least somebody still remember my birthday. Seemed like just 5 days ago when I was just relaxing at the   Costa Sands   chalets. Now I am pretty much suffering in camp doing a mixture of intensve driving and hair-pulling admin work.   I guess you all must be thinking why suddenly I am like a complain king. Maybe it is because I feel much better after expressing myself via this blog . I'm not such a good talker but when it comes to listening, I'm your guy. It always has been a bad habit of mine to keep my feelings within me and not poured out to my loved ones or friends . Even if I do, I do selective speaking. I tend not to say all the details but just the whole overview. You could say that it is because I'm a  cancerian  . a person who is secretive, moody and emotional. I admit, it plays a part but it is not the full reason.   Anyways, currently listening to   Class 95 fm's Lovesongs  , one of my favourite programmes since secondary school. The show discussed a lot of personal love issues , some of whichI can relate too. I had experience love before, unfortunately, it was not a bed of roses. Also in the programme is a series of moving songs, many of which are my favourite. Songs like  Right here waiting, purest of pain, one moment in time , etc...  Shall end here and might come back on Saturday to blog. if not, you will only be hearing / seeing me the following week. Peace and lots of love to one and all.    ------- --------------- -------------- ------------- --------   Oceans apart, day after day and I slowly go insane, I hear your voice on the line but it does not seem the same, oh can't you see it baby, you got me going crazy, whatever you do, wherever you go, whatever it takes, I will be right here waiting for you. ------- --------------- -------------- ------------- --------

      played  CM4  for the first time in almost 2 weeks liao. almost forgot where i left of. anyway, today was a totally waste of time in camp on detail to    Pasir Laba Camp  . went there thinking will be doing driving , in the end ended up eating, sleeping and eating and sleeping. ( like a pig , right..? hahahah)   alright week in review again. starting from Friday. most of the day was spent trying to do bus indent amendments that caused me a major headache and sleep lost that night.Even had to do work while Having dinner with my family and relatives at   Regent Hotel's Capers   resturrant for  German  food. Not too bad but sad to say, I tasted better food eslewhere.   Saturday morning was used to clear up the bus problem. luckily managed to solve the problem and quickly rushed back home after camp to pack my things for my weekend birthday chalet. Had invitied a few old friends and some new ones over . Helped mum to load the stuff to the car after which I cycled down to the chalets. Dumped the things there and went to   Parkway   to buy some esstentials. reached back to the chalety on time to meet  Frances, Weilun, Fuzhen, Jenny, Shun Mei, Angeline, lawrence, Huda, Eng Kee , Alfian and Pishu . some of them left half way thru but for those who stayed over, we spent the whole night/ morning playing tai di , bridge and monopoly. Monopoly, I was the surprise winner earning $ 10,022  . Long time since I last enjoyed myself like this. It was also great to see my buddies gain after such a long time.   Sunday was like the day before, waiting for people to come down .   Chiu Weng, Xuan Hui, Huang Chiet , Weiji and their coomonwealth juniors   came down , so did   Mr Ang and Chwee Ying   . I was definately surprised to see her because she had actually messaged me to say that she could not come down due to A Level preparations. Really Happy that she popped by.   Monday, and this is where my happiness turned sour. I was called back to camp to cover a duty which I had earlier switched with someone esle. oh well, I had kinda expected it. so I stayed overnight to cover the duty and as we were lacking in manpower, I was "lucky" enough to go for a nother 4am morning detail that ended up in a mess too. Was supposed to go to   Rifle Range Camp   to get ammo and go back camp, but ended up going to   Changi Airport  .  I wonder what is install for me tommorrow? I'm now 22 years old. But getting younger. I have seen my juniors grow, like one Ihave seen when she was a sec 1 cadet and now she is waiting to go poly. Time passes and people change, so they say. But I don't feel I changed, or even if I have, I might be trying to tell myself that I have not. like the song " Emotions"  , " it is just emotions taking me over......etc.." the future is getting closer for me to choose a correct path of life for which I am still undecided for. I feel really stressed up recently and extremely tired. not sure if it is because of what is happening the last few days or the fact that I reaching at that point of my life where I have to take control. Be it my future studies, work or love life, One thing is clear, I shall overcome these odds and succeed. take care and thanks again to all my buddies, friends and aquintances whom came to my chalet recently or dropped me a nice greeting.

      finally blogging after 3 days... been tired after a series of full day details which took me to  Outram, Jurong  and even to  TeKong . ( Yes, I went overseas to  Tekong  but only to as far as the Guard room there. hahaah, Last touched the island almost 1 year ago, my , how time flies)  Just got my duty forcast for the coming month. Got 5 duties, 1 on a Wed, 2 on a Fri and Sun respectively. ( Somemore the Sunday duties are back to back, will have to forego my grandmother's birthday because it is an extra duty) Also heard that will be doing Ambulance duty soon. Did some calculations recently, my mileage shot up to 5,000 km . pretty fast.   Realised that a lot of things happening this weekend. Saturday got   National Infoquiz  ( skipping it becoz i need to get presents), then got a farewell dinner for a fellow volunteer at  Marina South . As for Sunday, i got 2 birthday parties to go to and another bbq invitation. time management will play an important part this Sunday as I have agreed to all the events.   like i said in my previous blog,  Broz's   POP  at  SISPEC  is tommorrow, wonder if he is prepared for it. Should be resting now for the actual run tommorrow.  will be meeting him up thou in the evening for a district meeting.   Anyways, I dun think I will be blogging much for the next 3 days because of all the events, will let you know more the next time round.   Peace!

      Highlights for the day:  1.) Went to  Stagmont camp  for a detail and to  Ayer Rajah camp  later on too. Heard that I will be driving the new RSM to  Jurong Camp ,  Lava's  camp. But wonder if got chance to see him or not.   2.) Received a SMS from  Frances , a good friend of mine, asking me to go for her 21st Birthday celebrations this Sunday Afternoon(   that's mean i got 2 birthdays in 1 day to go to....means 2 presents to buy... oh no.. where got time to buy...argh!)    3.)  Broz  just called me asking me if I could go for this POP at  Tekong  this Friday.Told him not confirm as yet because I do not know my detail for that day. (   Hopefully, he is finally leaving the island  )  4.) Received an email abt a farewell dinner for a fellow instructor who is leaving for UK to further study. ALY suggested  Marina South  for steamboat. ( that is like de sa vule because we just went there on Last Thursday.)  5) Lastly, all the best to my cousin  Wayne , who is embarking into the life of a NSF personnel. Take Care of yourself in  Tekong .    Appetitate has not been good for me either. my moods tend to irregular. Somethings I eat my lunch n then have no mood for Dinner or no mood for lunch but i eat my dinner. Wonder if it because of my tiredness that affects.   Was reading  Wengz 's blog and  Lava 's blogs abt changes. I know myself and I can tell you this. I'm not the same person I used to be. People are right when they say nothing remains constant, things changes. For the better or the worse. for example 3 hard facts; Terrorism, computer or human Viruses (like  SARS ) and Economy. All of these have affected us in one way or another.  SARS  for example has brought the good in most of us. we practice taking temperature, washing our hands and show our fighting spirit.   I can say that I have changed, and it is up to me to find out if it is for the better or the worse.   Ending with this item taken off from  urlLink www.thoughts.com  , a site that i like to find gd phrases, uplifting sayings.     A MAN WITHOUT LOVE IS LIKE A TREE WITHOUT ROOTS.  A MAN WITHOUT DREAM IS LIKE A EARTH WITHOUT NATURE  A MAN WITHOUT HAPPINESS IS LIKE A LAND WITHOUT GRASS  A MAN WITHOUT THOUGHT IS LIKE A LIFE WITHOUT BREATH  A MAN WITHOUT FEELINGS IS LIKE A DAY WITHOUT SUN  A MAN WITHOUT HEART IS LIKE A SEA WITHOUT WATER  A MAN WITHOUT CARE IS LIKE A FLOWER WITHOUT FRAGRANCE  A MAN WITHOUT CONFIDENCE IS LIKE A PLANT WITHOUT STEM

      WWW or   What Women Want  . The movie was very interesting for me. Kinda hit me in my heart. For a beileve in this age that we live in, we , men, are becoming as concern as women are for their image, lifestyle. How many of you can say that they have not met a man who buys their spouses undergarments? or man who use different scrubs / moisturizers for their skin?  Good acting by one of my fav actors,  Mel Gibson .  getting late, start of a long work week again.   Oh ya, It is my maam  Doreen's  Birthday. Happy Birthday!

      went out for a while just now to meet a friend at  Bugis . Still feeling tired after last night's drive.Met up  Wengster  and  Xuanhui  for dinner at  Parkway  since they went down to  Campsite .Waited for them by the  Swenson's  and the 3 of us shared 4 main courses with a free Regular Earthquake. ( got a discount from the NDP goodie bags)   Lava  joined us later on. Sharing one car, we popped down to  nutfairy 's house and asked if she wanted to join us for a drive to  Changi . Told us that she can't because of work attachments and she could chat . In the end, we spent along an hour outside her house talking about everything, from class 3 licenses to  Changi's  "  ba-poks  " to visting  Warren Sir .   First stop in our mid night rendevous was Changi Coastal rd, where Lava brought us to his favourite spot to see the planes take off and land. then, we circled around the village to see their nightlife and the transsexuals. Saw a mixture of really chio ones and the cannot-make-it types. reached home about 2am this morning. Fell Asleep straight once my head hit the pillows.   hmmm... after my days off, I almost did not want to go back to camp. When I did, I spent the last 2 days driving full days. Clocked up about 300+ km within these 2 days. Travelled around the island, went to places like  Fajar, Woodlands, Yishun, Eunos, Pasir Ris, tiong Bahru, Little India, Jurong, Raffles Place, CMPB, Kranji . ( my poor feet are aching still because of all the footworks.) Even yesterday, I only finished at 5:30pm. Plus point is that I get half day off because of the afternoon detail.   Oh ya, as for the bbq, I must say, it was great meeting up with the instructors again. Not sure when I will see them again ,  Fnqs  too. Speaking of whom, he brought his collection of digital shots that he took and printed it up. Was red as a lobster because he had to do a recce at Jurong  Island  that afternoon. Had my fair share of food but i think the lucky one was  Fnqs  because someone had someone esle to shell the prawns and eggs. And ya, I think that ladies were freaking out on the way we threw live prawns to the boiling stock. hee hee. what can I say, it is a girl's thing.  One a serious note, I tend to find myself withdrewing from my usual group of friends, I seldom seem to start as conversation or  get into the discussoon. Not sure if it is because of my state of mind thinking of other things or something was changed me. Someone knows ???

      Timecheck: 12:15am... Haiz, there goes my 2 days off. So fast as soon it has passed. But it was fun while it lasted.  Got back from  Marina South  after a full-filling dinner with the  NDP03 instructors , Fnqs and Mr Ang . Will tell you more maybe tommorrow if I can use the computer in camp. Highlight of the dinner was getting pinched by  a crab on my finger, and man, my thumb is still hurting from it. So too did  Fnqs . So unlucky. Tommorrow is my second and last duty of the month, so I'm trying to hard to let it pass fast.   Good nights. For your info, I added a new friend's blog ,  urlLink an qi lin  and added my own online picture albums to the blog. Do visit them :)

      Feeling like a pig now. hahahaha.......Just woke up not long ago. Going out soon again.   Yesterday ended up not playing tennis in the morning because I decided to sleep in more. And when I did, I prepare myself to go to meet  Charlene . HAd lunch with her at  Raffles City's Out of the pan  resturant. She had chicken noodle soup while I had Peking Duck Crepe. Think feeling hungry we went to  Swensen's Orchard  to have a regular earthquake. (   sinful man, but it is gd to indulge once in a while  ).  Walked down the stretch of  Orchard  to  Plaza Singapore . Even visited the new Spotlight store at PS.Bought a few items on the way. Went our separate ways after meeting her friend at the MRT.  Proceeded to  HQ  to find the  West District Commonwealth Gang . Going to visit  Warren Sir . Was good to see him thou. Lost quite a lot of weight since he went in to hospital for his operation. Not as mobile as he was before but he looked much better. (  take care sir  )  Dropped  Shirley  off at her flat in the cab before going back as it was quite late already.   Today, will be watching   LXG   before finding the  NDP03 instructors  for makan at  Marina South . Having bbq steamboat. Yum Yum. :p

      Got two days off finally.   NO MORE ADMIN WORK   liao. the clerk is finally back from BMTC recourse. going to sleep soon. tommorrow want to make full use of the days off. Will be playing tennis in the morning before meeting  Charlene , at  Raffles City  for lunch. then in the evening will be going to HQ to meet some juniors to go visit  Warren Sir .  Sunday was  Pei Shan's  21st Birthday and she invitied most of the RCY people that she knows including her sec sch and poly mates. Held in  Costa Sands Pasir Ris , I met  Alfian, Lava, Beyond Words, RevIve, Jiayun   at the interchange first. Took some pictures and added it  urlLink here . Only a few pictures so please bear wif me. Also in the link is my own collection of pictures. Feel free to look.   Had some food and drinks, played card and watch tv at the chalet. I must say that  Pei Shan  looked very elegant in her dress. Happy   Sweet 21st Birthday, Young lady  . And may your future be blessed.  Before Meeting the rest of  Pasir Ris , I went to meet  Jim  , to talk for awhile. So happen that he works just above where  nutfairy  is having her attachments. Saw her on my way to the station. Only managed to say HI and bye to her thou.   As for yesterday, It was my last full working day as a clerk. So decided to clear as much work as I could before handing over to the clerk. Today, highlight of the day was getting my off pass signed by the  MTO . Also got orientated and accessed on Pickup. Went to  Lower Delta Rd  and  Queensway  area. Saw the  NDP  and  SYF  pictures that I took some time back. Some of it was very dark while some turned up pretty well. Thinking of scanning them to edit but my scanner is down. Need to get it fixed.    Here's my parting shot;   " To err is Human, it's ok; to learn from mistakes, that's the best way!"

      Wow! that felt so shoik ( just took a bath). Came back from  Marina Square  with  Alfian  , Yong Cheng, Huda, Chee Keong, Doreen Maam, Andy Sir, Evelyn and Cuiying . Went to  Kenny Roger's Roasters  after a tiring day at   InfoQuiz  .  Yong cheng  was treating us for the dinner. told him to share the bill with the seniors unfortunately he was stubborn.  Eng Kee  did not join us because he had some church gathering. Will be seeing tommorrow again thou because of  Pei Shan's  Birthday.   Let's talk abt my   Command Anniversary   , which was held at   3 Guards at Bedok Camp  . Was kinda boring but there was moments of laughter, amusement and excitement. Took part in a tug-of-war but lost out to a group of commissioned officers. Had a bit of lunch there before taking a cab down to  Siglap .   When I was there, I thought the rest of them were still busy setting up the decorations but i found out that the students using the hall had not finish and so i had round 2 while waiting. Tasked to take the pictures, I first assisted the cadets in registry. This year, the champions are  TKGS , followed by  TKSS  and  VS . ( this, I was not surprised)   pretty shagged liao. Had fun today thou it was extremely drained, physically and mentally.In Need of a good rest. Adios

      The weekend end is here and although   NDP   is already over, Tommorrow will still be a busy day for me . Going to  Bedok Camp  in the morning for my   Command Anniversary   where I am taking part in a tug-of-war event. After which, I'll be rushing to  Siglap Secondary  for the   East District Infoquiz 03  . There will only be 4 schools taking part this year because 2 schools pulled out last minute. (  oh well, what to do?   that's life, so unpredicatable ) Will be looking forward to out to see how well the new instructors fair in organising the event. It will be the first event for them to manage as well as our new DAD ,  Mr Andy Yeo  and DDO  Ms Doreen Tan . Here's wishing them all the best. We Will Succeed.  Anyway, these days, I'm kinda busy to blog or the computer had been taken over by my  Mum  and  Sister . Another reason is because of that worm virus taht wiped out almost 180,000 + computers worldwide. So played safe and only used the computers available in camp. Hee. The week was a bit dull, not much happened in camp. Only highlight for the week was I got accessed for my GP Car and i Passed. So got another vehicle that I can drive.   Also heard that I will be getting 2 days off after my clerk comes back to camp on Tuesday. So Cool. hmm... thinking on how to use the Offs.   getting late, luckily tommorrow booking in  in civilian. so not much things to pack. Listening to  Scorpions "   Winds of Change  " , the song with the whistlings in it. It is one of my favourite oldies. Time to enjoy the night away.

      feeling a bit terrible now. It's my eyes and nose, but mainly my eyes. Was doing some "  spring-cleaning  " just now while waiting for my turn on the computer. Managed to throw a heap full of stuff that included old nespapers, to expired medicine and plastics bags. think some dirt and dust got into my eyes, washed them liao and put eye drops to them. However, they ar still hurting like crazy. Hope it will be better tommorrow.  Before that, I spent a good time on the phone with 2 persons; firstly, My "  brother  "  Alfian  who called me from  Tekong . Currently resting after one of his field exercises. Was sharing all the intimate details of his experience there. It has been a super long time since I last saw him . Wonder how is he like now. Will be seeing tommorrow thou for a meeting.Spent almost half an hour chatting with him . finishing his specialist course so want to wish him all the best for his   POP  .   the other person was  Yong Cheng . Wanted to check with him on the progress of the   Infoquiz  , which is only 4 days away. Because I am totally isolated from their meetings. Oh well, they are still young and inexperienced like us and face more stresses than what I used to face. Education now is more important and most of them are tied down with their studies. So how, I kinda miss that feeling. the feeling of studying. Well, I guess I got to wait till i ORD to see what lies ahead. Planning may be made but it is  God's  will to see where I direct myself to.   Shall end with this. "   Success is not measured by the heights you attain but by the obstacles you overcome  ". Ask yourself, what have you achieve today? for myself, I have gained discipline and a sense of achievement because I cleaned my room..  ( ahaha.........................lame!)

      yeah, finally backed. Wanted to blog yesterday but was recalled camp to camp at 7:30am in the morning by onee of my SSGs. luckily managed to sleep enough to go back camp. In the end, went back to camp and slept there till abt 3pm before I actually had to do some work. Had to settle some bus logsheets with the NS MTO and his Specialists. Left camp only after 6+, took a bite at  Clementi  Central before heading home. Was still tired so didn't bothered to blog.   Today, I had to settle more stuff which had piled up from one day of MC. Was kept busy in the morning doing those stuff before relaxing slightly in the afternoon. Went back to  Kaki Bukit Camp  , where i did my driving lessons , to get a LOA from them. Saw my ex-officer in charge there and he still rememberes me too. Saw another friend I met there too by the canteen. Reached back to  Clementi  just in time for fall-out.   okays, more on   NDP03  .  Left home early that day to reach  HQ , when i reached, found out that  Dorl, bulohblue and ReViVe  was already there. Soon, the rest of the instructors as well as cadets came strolling in. Once Boss came, we went to set up the projector while the rest changed to their Full Uniform. Changed to my first Uniform, the one that  Lava  had borrowed, and I was surprised it could still fit. (   thought that too many pounds were put on cannot wear  ) Started to check the contingent's uniform standard before briefing them in the hall,  edwin and freddy  arrived shortly but we had to for the buses to bring us to the stadium.   At the stadium, we could see the some of the UGs were already there. As well as all the hardworking SAF personnels sweating it out for the big day. Saw  Stephen Sir and Keng Lum Sir  again.  Mr Andrew Ong and Mr Kek  visited the contingent too during a break at the  Indoor Stadium  after 2 runs at the  National stadium . Amazingly, there were not many casualties during the hot day. Thou the contingent should have done better during the wheeling and the umbrellas part, overall their performances was satisfactory.   In the  SIS , most of the cadets were exhausted and slept with only the few exceptions who were up and chatted with  beyond words, reViVe and myself . by 5pm, the contingent was having their early dinner. Before heading out for the actual event, we gathered the whole 106 of them for a group picture. Flashes of white dazed us for a few seconds ,  Boss and the Marshalls  were not spared too.   The time came, and soon, we were walking to the eyes of thousands of red coloured people. As the song, "  Forward, We/re Marching Forward...."   came, I could see in the eyes of the cadets that the moment of truth was here and it weas up to them to show their worth. Too bad that we are not allowed to see the parade. But as the national anthem started to play and everyone came to attention, I could sense of the feeling of unity, unity of one country, of 1 Singapore.   The best of yet to come after the cadets started running out of the stadium and onto the buses back to  HQ . Unable to leave because of the jam and fireworks, which is truly the best manmade wonder. What a sight it was. red, Green, Blue, Orange, u name it, the colour was there. Back at  HQ , all of us were treated to a feast of Bee Hoon, fishball and buffalo wings. Entertainment was nonstop from  Freddy and Dorl  close encounters, to the male instructors and marshalls doing the chicken dance to a powerpoint and Flash presentation by  beyond words, Freddy and Dorl  (   great job pplez. it was magnificant)    At the end, one of the most memorable thing was receiving a Thank You card, a jar of sweets and a flower from the  Cedar Girls'  presentatives. they gave each instructor the same thing including freddy. Speaking of whom, he received a small token from all of us(   a rcy ndp03 tee, a postcard with our well wishes, the rcyndp03 badge and the cd with the presentations  )  and from me personally (   one of the 2 turtle badge which I bought the day before)    Okays, i think that sums the  NDP03  for me. will be waiting for the encore telecast next sat, but will be busy with  infoquiz  at  siglap . Oh well.

      Timecheck : 1:09am.  Back not long ago from HQ, shared a cab with  ReViVe  and  U^HappY  back home, reached back pretty fast, too us abt 25mins for all places.  Feeling very tired now, so will make it short. I will remember this day for a long time. It was an interesting experience for me because it was a many 1sts for me.   Will tell you more after I have recuperated enough. All I can say is It was fun while it lasted. To me, it is just another event that has passed but still the memories of all the trainings, all the scoldings, all the different cadets' personality and behaviour will  always be kept deep within my heart . Because it has became part of my life.    To end, I would like to thank a few persons :  Mr Ang  for guiding us when we are in a fix; my fellow instrutors for keeping my Saturdays something I look forward to; to the cadets for imprinting in me a deep impression of you in Red Cross.(  people like the  Cedar Girls 'and Hougang Sec's  group ,  Benedict Ho, Ivan, Benjamin, Cedric, Terence, Hui Ping  to name a few )  Once again , Hope you enjoyed the parade and had a good holiday.

      It has finally come, it's here.   NDP03!!!!!    Just finish packing my things for later. Got back from Orchard not long ago. Met with  Lava  in the late afternoon to go near  Raffles  area to do his name card.Yeah, I know I should be resting at home after getting a MC yesterday. Sshhh...........Anyways,  Lava  Gave me the idea to create one for myself. After that went window shopping for gifts for  Pei Shan , whose birthday is coming up soon. Found some ideal ones and bought them .  Lava  even bought himself a tee from  Giodarno  ( thanks to me, he got a discount) haha. Popped down  HQ  to talk to  Dor  and  Ms Teo . Had a quick dinner at  PS' LJS  again then headed towards  Orchard .  Lava  also bought a new chain and cross.   Walked down to the Heeren shops to look at more stuff and saw some interesting things. Myself, I bought 2 badges with a turtle cartoon on it which states, "  I may be slow but I'm ahead of you   " cute sia. Then passed by  Hello Orchard  and saw a long queue, thought what was going on. In the end, saw that they were having some promotions about the free incoming calls. Thought of taking this opportunity to buy the phone that I've been eyeing for a long long time. A   Nokia 6610  .   After queueing and waiting for 1 1/2 hours before it was my turn to be served, I was presented with my newest investment and toy. Decided on a black one because it looked more matured looking. Said goodnight to  Lava  and thanked him for accompanying me to buy my phone. ( thanks bro) Saw  Naux  on the way back on the train. She had earlier called to ask me what bus goes to Geylang  from Eunos MRT.   Oh man, the time now is 1am+, better get to sleep if not I'll be tired for tommorrow. It's going to be a Super Long day. Once again, Here's wishing all Singaporeans a Happy 38th Birthday. Enjoy the parade!

      Wow! Just woke not long ago, today on MC for 1 day because of a bad case of the migraine. Been having a series of sharp pulling pains by the side and front of my head throughtout this whole week. But Yesterday was the worse so far. When I was walking out of camp going back home, I felt suddenly so painful, esp when I try to close my eyes to refocus myself. Went to my  Dad 's friend's clinic at  Marine Parade  because I cannot used my Dad's MC. thou his friend was not there, the substitute doctor was nice enough to give me a day to rest.   Found out that  Dad  and  Sis  went off for their flight. Going to  Malaysia  for the weekend. Will be missing the parade. Anyways,  Mum  and my older Uncle will be going for   NDP  . so I told them to take some snapshots of the contingent for us.   Went to  Sembawang Camp  yesterday for a transport meeting in the morning, saw  Tong , a friend from course there. Was a short meeting, confirming the dates of the civilian bus indents for the camp. After that, took the bus and train back to camp. The rest of the day went around doing the same routines.   Hate doing amendments to the bus indents, the NS MTOs always give last min changes. Like for this Sunday, they only told me the changes on Wed evening. Don't they know that they cannot have everything to go their way. Remind me of  Lava  abt people's resistace to changes. I had already told them that the bus contracter is tied down with things and cannot change to meet the new changes but the MTO insists. Now, I'm like the middlemen trying to solve this issue. Maybe I'm sick because of this stupid reason.   Tommorrow is already  NDP . Hope I have enough strength to go on with the training. This is the first time I'm part of the group of instructors training the cadets. The last time I was in  NDP , I was doing First Aid duty by the galleries. That was way back in let's see...hmmm......1998?  Doesn't time fly so fast? Sorry, like to say that often these days because to me, time is really precious. I like to make full use of the time to do things. Time for my brunch. and in a need for a bath now.

      Just like that , in a blink of an eye, another day has passed and we are only about 2 days away from  National Day . Isn't it amazing how time flies by before you know it. All of us are getting older, for the better or the worse only heaven knows. Just to talk on a point brought up by my bro  Lava , on setbacks in life. I can already name my top 5 in my life so far. Some of which I am shamed of but have to regrets and some that I grower wiser and stronger because of it.   1.) failing my second language since primary sch. 2.) failing my course in poly. 3.) failing in love ( for the first time) 4.) failing to pass my military driving test ( managed to pass after 7 attempts) 5.) failing to spent time with my family.   these were my lowest moments in my 22 years on this planet. However, I learnt from these obstacles and have already set a target which  I can a time limit.   Anyways, got a few signifinance things that happened today in camp. Found 4 cute  kittens  by my 5ton store, were new-borns and in a mess. couldn't tell how many days old were they but I could guess that they were hungry and cold. passed it to a friend of mine to look after them. Next, helped to get a new set of sofas for our duty room because the current one was already broken. Lastly , was told to go down 1  st Tpt Bn   for a transport meeting tommorrow morning, so that means I can wake up slightly later. Cool !   okay la, will stop here, maybe might add some pictures from last Sat's training to the site. have a pleasant night.

      I shld be sound asleep by now on most days, don't know why I'm still awake. Maybe it is because I'm thinking of someting. something that has kept me up these few days. many things are happeniing soon for me , some of which I have been anxiously waiting for. Like my pay day, (  this month will be getting extra $150 more tahnks to my mileage claims ) NDP in camp as well as at  National Stadium  ( t he actual day has come, and it's time for the cadets to prove their worth, to show that the last 4.5 months were not wasted ) Comd day and District Infoquiz (  will be having both events on the same day but I'm more worried abt the quiz because the juniors are handling it for the first time on their own and lack the neccesary supervision from the seniors )  the last 2 days in camp has been pretty manageable but come the weekend, the place will be in a mess. Another phrase of the ICT will be coming down for ranges and they involve the uses of chartered buses. The last ICTs have caused me much sorrow as I am constantly editting the indents for the trainings. Praying that this week will not be like the previous few.   The only thing keeping me kinda motivated is that ir's the long weekend due to the National day. and the fact that soon, my sats are going to be slightly more free once the parade is over.  Songs are another means of destressing.  Gold 90.5fm  has taken over my airwaves at night with some that I can remember been played when I was just a little boy. Currently tuned to the song "   When will I see you again  " . These brings me back sweet memories. Memories which I have missed.   NDP does not seem that lively or as publicised as the past. Thou I admit that this year's parade is definately one of the better ones, the atmosphere is just isn't there and maybe it is because we have matured, we look things from a different perspective. I'm now in a age gap that makes me too old to enjoy the parade like when I am young or too young to fully understand how adults celebrate our nation's birthday.   kays, the time has come and I've gotta go. sweets dreams

      of late, I have seen many of my close friends feeling kinda down due to some personal reasons. Well, all I can say is it is best to start a new, Thou certain memories may be hard to forget, it is best to do so. Harbouring such memories may only be more harm than good for you. A positive outook on life is a good start to make. Next would be to make resolutions, just like in New Year, this will help you to focus your directive in life and lead you to the path that would see you go far.   People look for things to inspire themselves, be it an animal, a song or a friend. For myself, I am kinda inspired by a certain animal , one that most of my friends know. And that it is the hard -shelled turtle. I have grown in character similiarly to that of the animal's. I'm very self-consicous, a hard nut of crack at sometimes and keeps most of my feelings locked up to myself. It may sound kinda negative to the rest but to me, I find that it is type of character I'm comfortable in. This is what distinguishes myself out of the rest.  I tend to share my intermost details to only the closest of friends whom I can relay on.   I can even remember one time after a camp, I asked for the participants' feedback and most of them agree that I'ma quiet person. Well, I have to agree on it and back that fact with the fact that I liked to observe people, observe their behaviour and character before talking to them. I feel more confident after knowing what I see and use it to my advantage.   People will grow and change, nothing stay constant, it is a way of life. And that's all I can say.

      hmmm... home alone right now. My whole family is still out for lunch. Did not want to join them because I was still very tired from the past few days events.  Woke up only abt 12+ just now. Watched " Cruel intentions " on  AXN  channel before logging on. Went to download the new song for this year's  NDP ,   Place in your heart  " by  Sean Wong .  one of the better songs that I heard in a long time. Felt that it was better than the "   One united Singapore  "  by  Stephanie sun . What's ur opinion?  Here's a wrap up of my weekend.  1.) Thursday, other than my usual army work, the evening was spent meting up with  Lawrence  for Dinnera t  PS LJS  before going to meet  Shannen  for round 2 for desserts at the  Cafe Cartel . Saw  Wendy  there with her polymates having a bite too. Chatted with  Shannen  on some stuff till about 8:30pm before taking the train with her back home.   2.) Friday was my first duty in almost 1 month and it was also the first day of the new month. so coincedential ar? Was kept pretty busy the whole morning doing the  SARS  temerature forms because we had to submit the Chief clerk for audit check. Had to run errants for my specialists and my officer . Managed to grab a bite finally at abt 2+pm. the afternoon was slightly more relaxed becuse most of my things were done. But in the early evening, I was asked to go down to  Nee Soon  to pick some oficers back to camp. The night passed pretty un-interrupted. Was quite glad because most of my duties were always filled with late night calls and other events that caused lack of sleep.   3.) Saturday, my duty ended after I handed over my duty to one of the new drivers. I quickly went to my officer to sign my leave slip and went out of camp.   Took a cab down to hq to bath and changed. Still early, I went to buy my breakfast. Saw cadets streaming in about 9+. Other instructors streamed in too as the morning went by. Started to take the attendance for them and soon, we were making our way to the  National Stadium  after a ashort Unform inspection and a briefing session. took the Ambulance with  Mr Ang  while the rest hopped on the buses. Lunch was Pizza and drumlets (  unfortunately none for the instructors ) followed by a series of component and full sequence runs under an extremely humid weather. In total our casualty rate was about 8. Totally utilized our reserves. Was only back at the  Singapore Indoor Stadium  at about 3:30pm. the cadets were treated to a video clip of the   Preview   last week .  Dinner was served at 5pm before the last full timing sequence run at 6pm was started. After the run and other stuff were done, we boarded back to the buses and headed back to Hq. at HQ, we had a series of entertaining moments from a " wedding ceremony " to a "  baby -sitter demo " to a "  gay  " issue  that involved 3 personnel.  Eng Kee  thou was the one most hard hit. poor guy. and it's all thanks to another volunteer from the CCAB.   Had dinner again at  MOS Burger  with the rest of the instructors. Shared a cab with  EK  and  Zhiwen  as I will not have any buses if I took from the MRt station. Washed up a bit and went thru some emails before finally Ko-ed at at 1am.    An issue that I had been thinking abt in recent times has been encouraged by  Shannen  during our meeting on Thursday and by  Angeline  after reading her comments on my blogger. I have only 1 life , and I should cherish the moment, If I never do it, I will never know. I will take their advice. The only obstacle now is time. Most of my days are packed with my commitments to  SAF  on weekdays and My sats are burned for  Red Cross . The only other day is Sunday which is normally spent with my family but recently due to NDP, it is normally my rest day at home. Been trying to find the right moment to do it, But it is always easier said than done. Guess I have to say, " only time will tell "

      That's it. the day I'm waiting for ... my final duty for the month is over. Just saw my next month's forecast. pretty alright, 4 duties in 4 weeks ( 1 per wk) Only 1 weekend duty on a sat. but i think tt is ok. Heard from my friends tt my duties might be ambulance duty ,which  means slightly more " comfort ". Cannot wait to be orientated in ambulance. let   Yesterday was a "  pig-out  " day for me. From the moment i reached camp, I lazied around and even slept from 10am to abt 6pm. hahahha... but night was a different story. couldn't sleep much because of all the mosquitos. so irritating.  Today, had to replace a detail for a friend. whole day in a pickup. Was almost unbearable. going 50km /hr on the expressway going islandwide.  Recently, my mind is full of thoughts and sometimes, i feel that it might explode. I feel so " mixed up " inside. Worse of all , i don't even know what I'm thinking abt. there seems to be a consistant stream of thoughts flowing throught my mind. Maybe I am reaching the point of my life where i really need to know where I'm heading to. I cannot say " anything" all the time.   been considering my future in the following areas: 1.) life after NS - to study or work? 2.) life in Red Cross - do i still have the drive to volunteer on? 3.)  financial future - my savings if any?  4.) love of my life?????? God knows. 5.) family & friends - how can i entertain these 2 groups andnot dissapoint anyone?  As qouted from the Ad. "  I really don't know! i really don't know!"   i think this best sums up my mood for today.  Maybe will ask  An Qi Lin n Lava  if they are up for mocha tommorrow. sayonara.

      sleeping soon; just want to update on keys points these 2 days.   Yesterday, had in camp detail. Gate tested the gate for it's new sensors and CCTV. After camp, went to cut my hair really short.  Today, had external run at  Marina Park . Then in the afternoon till just now; had the POC for   ULC03  . thou only a handful of cadets got the ranks, i think it was the experience that they went thru the last 5 weeks that count. Would like to thank Viz Sir and all others and  Lava  for all the help they have done.  Lava  too for the ride home.   Good nights. It's coming to 1am.

      Listening to my   Carpenter's Greatest Hits   CD, just decided to listen to it after knowing abt singing for Sat. Really liked their songs. So harmonious and catchy. However, I don't feel "  top of the world " today. Maybe it is because I'm physically and mentally exhausted. Somemore, it had been raining the whole day, got drenched at one moment when I was at CMPB.    Another day passed and It's friday again. But to me, the week is still halfway thru. Still waiting for 1 last duty on Sunday to go and it is the end of this month. Had a tiring day today, full day detail after yesterday's duty. Islandwide again , going to places like Mowbray Camp (  i didn't know it was so near Yew Tee MRT ), CMPB, Mindef and SAF FT. got 170+km today, making my current mileage standing at the 6300km range already.   Yesterday, I went to help  Tham  to do the 106 store. we managed to do quite a lot of things but they had to stay till 7plus before we called it a day. Still have quite a lot of things to finish . Haiz don't know when we can complete it. People think drivers are "  sing nang  ", they think it is only driving that they do. Well, they are wrong! We got to do duties, details which fall on Weekends too you know. We got to look after the vehicles, wash them, check the tools, maintain the store(  which we are doing now ). Not to mention abt exercises and orientations. Sometimes, we sleep for less than 6 hours and still got to drive or drive continously for 6-12hours non stop.(  tt's my record so far )   ok la, don't want to talk abt the unpleasant stuff. I'm just waiting for Sat's POC at HQ and my external run. chiao!

      blogging again after 4 days of absense;  Sat:- Went to Camp for healthy lifestyle walk. After which, had to prepare my GP car for Sunday's detail. Met up with  Han Wen  at Tampines for a followup on my reading of the Bible. Then, went back to dump my stuff at home before meeting up  Peishan, Weiji, XuanHui, Wengz  at PS. Window-shop for a while, even bought 3 bookmarks for 3 close pals tt was feeling under the weather recently. Hope they will like the inspirations on it. made our way to hq to find  Lava and An Qi Lin .  beyond words and EK  was there too with the ULC cadets.  Proceeded to Shaw Centre, to "  The Ship  " for dinner followed by a drinking session at  Jazzbar  @ stadium cove. Reached back at 12:30am.    Sun:- Duty day but had to go for a detail to Delta Sports complex. some of the officers went to play hockey. (think it was a tournament). Spent the rest of the day rotting in camp watching TV or listening to the Radio. Missed my Grandma's birthday, so i called her to wish her. Also missed the ULC hike to Ubin. wonder how was it? hmm.... pretty sad tt most of my weekends are been burnt this month. Praying hard tt next month should be better.   Mon:- Suffering from the night's feast by mosquitos. had bites all over my arms and neck. Went to help out at the 106 store in the morning after breakfast before i was tasked to report for last min detail to send 2 of my colleagues to DB. long story which i will not say. However after 3 hours of waiting and no action, i was told that it was delayed to today.  Today:- Went to  Seletar West Camp / Ponggol Barat  for detail. My first outfield in almost 4 months. Couldn't get sure to the bumpy road at first but soon all was ok, thou i kinda pity the NSmen in the cabin behind. Had a "fun" time washing the 5ton before mum picked me up from camp.   tommorrow is duty again. luckily no detail for me, so far. hmmm really cannot wait for the last duty on Sunday to be over.  this has to be one of my busiest week in army. 3 duties in 8 days. looking forward for Sat's external run at Marina and the ULC POC at HQ. heard tt we are singing "   top of the world  " on sat. nice song.

      took a care bear test from one of my friends' blogs. The results shld appear above. If not, I'm supposed to be " Tenderheart Bear " ;as quoted  " You are thinker, organizer, peacekeeper, and leader all in one. You have a power to command attention and people listen to you. However, you are often so concerned about not hurting others' feelings that you don't tell them what they need to hear and this gets you both into trouble. But you always have loyal friends to help you out "  This will be the starting of a super long week in camp. Basically will be coming back to camp everyday for the next fortnight.  The weekend does not seem to bring me much " enjoyment " or excitement as it sure too. maybe I'm getting old(er) , the senswe of thrill is lacking in me. Luckily tommorrow there is no detail for me. Feeling a bit under the weather these 2 days... yesterday couldn't even breathe properly. Now, I'm slightly better but still having my blocked nose.   Today, I drove to   29 SIB   for detail in a 5 ton. Almost regretted, the vehicle was almost unable to go in. it was so tight that i was scared that i would damage the vehicle. Gd thing, it went thru unscathered.   Don't know what esle to write... I'm stuck for once. think I shall end like this.

      hmmm..... almost did not want to blog , but i think had to because the following week will be staying in camp more often... 3 duties in 8 days... n 2 of them on Suns.   yesterday, went to meet  An Qi Lin and EK  for movie again,   Sinbad   at  Suntec . Mum gave my free Eng Wah ticket vouchers and just decided to use them. Went window shopping after that before proceeding to  CityLink's Pacific Coffee . beyond words joined us after his lessons ended. Headed to HQ to  print some things out before going back to  PS  for dinner. Had a super long district meeting to discuss abt the coming camp in Dec. Shared a cab with the some of the juniors. quickly packed my things because today I had an early morning detail.  Today started off pretty bad, my vehicle i supposed to use had it's IU not working and after 1 hr of transferring stuff and signing logbooks, i left camp at 0730am and i was supposed to be there before 8am. Haiz. Got worse because it rained heavily. my whole No. 4 was drenched. Only consolation for the day was my Officer treated me to lunch at  Changi Village . Had Nasi Lemak. Shoik ar...   reached back to camp and  Han Wen  passed me his Bible to read.was so kind of him to do that. Felt reluctuant to keep it at first but he insisted. Had forgotten to tell you folks that i may be converting soon. trying to find my calling right now. Been feeling pretty lost as of late , something seemed not right. I think i need to find my sense of life right now and I hope that the   oh mighty one   can guide me. Will it bring a new chapter to my life? time will tell.

Quickly changed and headed to camp. Slept super early at abt 8+.  3.) Sunday, woke up at 2:45am. Left camp at 3:30am to the  Nat'l Stadium .

      hmm.... not really what the topic says, I've got something to say.   Firstly, I had an average day in camp today. Drove to  Mindef  in an Auto GP Car after been accessed by  Yan . Other than that, i found out what my suspicion had ben hinting. I kena arrowed to morning   AHM   minibus detail. This is the actual day, will have to stay in on Sat because Sun moving off at 3:30am. haiz.. luckily only in the morning and that Sat is a long weekend . Might popped down to schs or  ULC  at campsite. This will be followed by my second duty of the month on Monday. So want to enjoy myself before the "torture" begins.  Secondly, recently i got a friend who in feeling extremely sad and is feeling a bit " pity " of himself. He has been talking abt negative thoughts and blames himself at times for his misery. Myself, all that I can offer to him is my ears. Listening to him speak at times terrifies me. Because he is the same age as me. I count myself lucky because i am blessed with a fruitful and blissful life. I got what i want by just opening my mouth. it was only after i finish sec sch and entered poly and the working life that i know life is not a straight road. With so many bends here and there, I almost wanted to give up. However, i took them as a lesson, learnt from the mistakes i made and try my best not to repeat them .   Anyway, getting back on track, I am lost in words to help him . (   Sorry broz  ) Words they may be, but i hope that that is all it is coming from him. He had thanked me for listening to him and for being there when he needed a shoulder. As both of us are currently serving the nations, I try to cherish the time spent with him when we both are free. Finding time to spend with him is hard but the discussion we get into are worth it. I got to understand slightly better and he , me. Just want to let him know that I'll be there for him if he wants.   Tommorrow will b busy cleaning up the store in camp because of an inspection, which if passed, I'll be able to get 5 days off. Just imagine what I can do with the time.   Lastly, I like to wish all a good night. Contemplating on watching a movie tommorrow evening, esp any opening ones.  sayonara!

      Well, that was something i learnt over the weekend. Here's the details:  Saturday, I was " heng " enough to find out that I need not go to the detail and that the off I got was still valid. So I quickly called  Lava  to see if it was alright if I can stay throughout the whole camp. He agreed with the green light and I quickly rushed back and packed my things.   When I reached campsite, Saw a lot of familar and unfamilar faces there. The cadets were just about to have lunch before going to  East Coast Park  for a short jog / hike. Was assigned to group " Charlie ", and went to make my aqquintance with the cadets. Since I had my lunch before coming, i watched on as the rest ate. Changed to my shorts and brought out my BMTC sling bag. The journey was pretty long and slightly dangerous because the road they used was on a busy street. Played some games before heading back Campsite at abt 4+.   Survival Cooking   was next and I helped  Lava  for a while in preparing his bbq Chicken before assisting " Charlie " with their pit. Was nice of them to offer me some of their food esp since it was a limited supply. After some debrief and AOP till 3am, I took some time chatting up with  Guoxiu, Shirley, Miwa, Mel and  beyond words   abt anything before catching an hour of sleep before "  Charlie " took over the camp. It was Sunday before I could realise it.  The cadets tried their best, unfortunately, they made a lot of mistakes that I had a page full of things to feedback abt within the first hour of the camp. Had a " tekan " session with them while breakfast was serving. Once cleaning up after breakfast, I managed to get another hr of sleep while the cadets had a lecture. Woke up and wash up a bit, took a bus to HQ but kena stuck in traffic thanks to the   Big Walk  . Had my district's accreditation going on. Stayed on until abt 3+before taking a cab down to campsite. The cadets were in the middle of preparing for the night's campfire as well as a mock recruitment drive.  Preparations was a mess at one time but soon all was well and the stage was set for a night of entertainment. Saw  nutfairy 's sister there too and my ex-Pasir Ris cadet , they were invited for the campfire. What a night it was , full of laughter, jokes and of cfourse the beautiful red amber burning in the night.   Took time off to follow  Lava  to the hospital because he was complaining abt stiomach pain. He got a day MC and when we reached back, I was surprised to see that the cadets were working hand in hand with each other in the area cleaning. the night was not done without the standard debrief and AOP, this time around, I was not able to sleep and went to oversee the morning's training as the rest slept. Was joined by   Rocelle and Chee Keong and Shirley .   Had some changes in PT because time and lighting was a factor. Delayed for a while and things run smoothly, the station games was quite a success. Enjoyed the way the cadets tried to persuade  Vincent  sir to get his leg hair and  Chee Keong's  wallet. the rest of the day was more or less downhill, Lunch was one of the best for the 3 days (  maybe because the Instructors cooked it)  . Soon area cleanining was done and after a short lecture and final briefing, the best part of the camp was here, Photo taking. Had a big course group picture followed by Individual teams. Wondered what my group did to me during the imformal pose.   Went straight back after break camp, bath away all the dirt that had been building up and slept before 9pm. Had a wonderful experience, missed these type of memories, Full of Ups and Downs. Was interesting to see how cadets can be such a pain when they refuse to cooperate and make careless mistakes but was worth it when you see the bond they build up and how they help each other when they see one another in a tight spot.     As for today, still feeling the effect was lack of sleep , was unable to keep my eyes open throught the morning. Luckily no detail for me today. But I had to go out in the afternoon to replace one detail. Went islandwide and clocked up another 94km, reaching my 2nd mileage claim soon, left 120km to go. saw the effect of my sleepiness kick in with some minor glitches and close calls.  better play safe. no laughing matter esp since veh accidents was the most dangerous.   ok.. long enough i think. me going to get more sleep. hahahaha.

      First of, I would like to wish my dear friend  Fuzhen  a Happy 22nd Birthday.(  You're in the 22 club liao, finally found someone to parther me..heee  )  Today was a pretty lacklustrated day. Almost Overslept because i had trouble sleeping in the humid weather. Went to  ST LOG  twice for detail today. Drove the pickup. When I got backed, I was told that I was "arrowed" for the Sunday  AHM  Minibus detail. Bad point I will miss the Accreditation at HQ because I do not know what time it will end. Might popped down to  continue at the  ULC  at campsite if time permits. Good point is I'll get 1 day off for that detail on Monday, so that is not too bad.   This month will be burning my Sundays with army stuff because I got 2 duties which falls on the last 2 weeks of the month. Now plus this Sunday's detail n maybe next week might be arrowwed for AHM ferry service. Dun know how ar...   Well, I guess I have to live life as it comes by, make full use of what I can do with the time and learn to treasure them. It is already Sept, soon , Christmas will be here and the New Year.   Dun you feel that this year passes by so fast?

      Had a Full-filling exprience wif  Broz Alf  at  Parkway's Pizza Hut . We had shared a meal that was supposed to be for 4-5 pax between the 2 of them. Real Stuffed now.Took my half day off today because I cannot bring it forward to the next month. Earlier on, met up with  Jenny, Shun Mei, Pishu  up to watch the movie "   Pirates of the Carribean  ". Quite an alright show to my standard. Only particularly liked the special effects showing the actors switching from flesh to bone with the light of the moon. Popped down to  Comex 03  at Suntec for a while and happen to see  Jiayun  over there.   In camp, it was a different story. Went to the medical centre to ask for a referral letter to go to  National Skin Centre  to enquiry of my outbreak of rashes that is going on and off as of late. enjoyed my off esp to release some tension that had been building up last night.   Yesterday was not my best of days due to 2 reasons.  1.) I broke the key to my pickup for my detail after topping it up in camp. Part of the key was struck inthe key slot and broke off. ( luckily got spare key to use)  2.) Slightly more serious, I had a minor mishap in camp. I accidently dented my 5 ton tailboard while reversing it into the empty lot. Had to write statement and was told off by my specialist because I was considered an experience driver. Because of that incident, my sleep last night was affected because I do not know what type of punishments if any will i get.    Arr,,, feeling F@#% ing hot now, my air con is down and the fan does not seem to help. Mum had my air con unit replaced with a new model but apparantly it cannot be operated just yet.   kk..gtg.

      Back not long ago from  Parkway . Went to meet up  Broz Alf,  he called me just as i reached home in the evening to ask if I wanted to meet up for a drink. Had drinks and a snack at  Coffee Bean  and chatted about his posting to  BMTC . Could see it in his eyes that that was apparantly not his first choice of unit. well, at least he got until Sunday to enjoy. On a long break to rest, might meet him up again to see how he is doing.   Got a SMS just now from  Broz Lava . Got quite a shock when i read it. Said that he was admitted to hospital for chest pains. Told me that  nutfairy  just visited him. Can't go to visit him because tommorrow i got duty. Trying to clear off on Thursday, if can, then i'll pop down. Very Worried for the poor guy, being feeling very down as of late and there seems nothing that i can advice him on.   As for me, today, went down to 4 places or rather 5 places. To  CMPB, Stagmont  before going to  ALB , Maju camp and IMM . another 100 km to my account. Got caught in the rain today and  feeling the after effects right now , having a little running nose currently.   kays, me need my rest, be back in 2 days.

      This is going to be a long one, so pls bear wif me.    Friday's highlights   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Another full day detail going islandwide, sure will be clocking up more than enough mileage.   Broz's  POP at  Tekong . ( Just heard that he is going to be Company Sgt at  BMTC  looks like 2.5 years at Tekong Liao)  District meeting at HQ with my fellow volunteers. Also celebrated a belated Birthday for  Dor .      Saturday's highlights   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Went to  Novena  Area for morning detail, had early fall out in camp , which means more time to buy presents for Birthday people.  Met  Jim ,  Jenny  up at Orchard to buy gifts for  Frances  and  Fuzhen . For Her, we came up with the idea of getting her a set of earrings From  Perlin Silver . Jenny included a pendant and a hp chain under her own account. I threw in a pair of  Eng Wah  Tickets vouchers for her. For Him, we got him a OP wallet and a  Giodarno  tee. Went to meet up  Gigi  and  CY  after parting with the 2 Js. Followed the 2 ladies to  Wisma  and  Far East  to Window Shop for a suitable farewell gift for  Wing Yan . In the End, they got her a cute Penguin stuff toy. As the 2 of them waited for  aly , I made my move first as I was meeting the ex TKSS instructors , all of them who are serving army like me, at  Marina South  MRT. Saw Guanda before JiaMing and Wenlong turned up. Decided to walk all the way to the BBQ area as the bus stop was packed with people. ( Long weekenf for many , Teachers' Day you know)  Had a good meal, despite having been eating at the same outlet just 2 weeks ago. Shared and listened to the stories of the 3 Officers-in-training.  Wenlong  is signing on in AirForce,  Guanda  is in  OCS  while  Jiaming  is in the same camp as  Lava .   Thought that once I reached home, I will straight go to bed, who knew that Lava called me and asked if I wanted to go drink at Siglap. Said Ok, because it is good sharing time with my dear friend, who is currently feeling a bit down, ( shall not disclose too much because it is kinda personal) Had a heart to heart talk with him, Sang campfire songs while waiting for  nutfairy  to finish work. Had Supper after she joined us and only slept at abt 4am in the morning. Hee hee.      Sunday's highlights   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Woke up late and rushed to go fiind An Qi Lin's Present at  Parkway . Met up Weilun first before taking bus to meet up the rest.  Jenny and Jim  were already waiting for us. But we had to wait for  Fuzhen  to come. It was only 2+ then we went up  to Frances' house. was pretty crowded with her poly, sec sch friends and family , but tio mention us in her house. Took some pictures and have uploaded them to the link on the right. I think  Weilun  and Fuzhen were eyeing some of frances' friends, hahaaha .. wait better stop here, if not they will say me too.   In the later half of the day, I proceeded to  An Qi Lin's  chalet at  Downtown east . Most of the people I know were there, from seniors to juniors, from people whom I always see to those I don't.  WengZ, Xiongz, Lava, HC, CY, MH, Drumz, YP, Mel, shannen, dor , etc... Ate more this time around because I was hungry, I like self cooked food. Played Bridge and Dai di too Only took 3 picture because the rest were blur. : )   Lava drove me back after the event, at abt 11+. quickly changed and slept.   As for today, drove full day again, in a non-aircon vehicle, was sweating like nobody's business and got sunburn on my right arm. Went to places like 1st  Guards, CMPB and Mindef . Saw tommorrow's details, me got 2 consectutive ones in the same vehicle as today. ( oh my  Mama!)  Lastly, want to wish all teachers a   HAPPY TEACHERS' DAY.   Thanks for guiding us all the way. Also want to wish Frances' a sweet Happy 21st Birthday. Official Legal and a year older.  Best wishes and may god bless you.

      Hi, Managed to steal some time to blog. Still in the midst of my Driver Class 1 at Sembawang Camp. Met up with my old friends and got to know some new ones. Finished my outfield exercise to Mandai and Yishun. Tommorrow will be going thru Crane operating and Winching, so that means i need to bring my helmet to camp. Learnt basically the same thing that i went thru for my SGT course earlier this year. So i kinda took this as a refresher course. Enjoyed myself so far. hope it lasts!    Lava  called me up in the evening , asking if i was going for the halloween blood drive tommorrow. told him yeah i was but i did not know what time i finished camp. Anyway, told him to choose a costume for me when he goes to find one costume for himself. He dropped by to show me what he rented, found out that i was a   trojan gladitor gown,   equipped with sandals, helmet and a mace. So cool!  Hope that tommorrow the rest will be coming so that we can have a good laugh over there.  Kays," Happy Halloween to all " don't spook yourself to death . HAppy Scaring each other.

Had a drink at  lucky plaza  before window shopping at  Taka  and then proceeding to  Plaza Singapore's Carreffour . Was always a pleasure time with  Lava , because we understand one another. Talked abt RCY, n other stuff.   Anyways, will be logging off soon.

Was quite a botimg day except for yesterday morning when i realised that my keys were not with me. started to panic because it was almost 8 and my uniform and other stuff were in my bunk and locker. Managed to break open and get my Uniform. haiz, what a way to start the day.    On Friday,  Went to meet some of the others to go cycling. I think we cycled almost a total of 20km on that day. there was even 2 malay guys who cycled down from woodlands and yishun respectively. I was so impressed!.

      Let me first start by wishing all my hindu friends a  happy deepavali . and for the non-hindus, enjoy the break too. I know i will esp after what happened yesterday.  Suffered my first breakdowns for almost 1 year. Was driving a 1.5 ton to 21 SIB to report for detail, however the silly vehicle stalled engine on me   not once, not twice but 3 times  . the first at Paya Lebar Flyover, the second after Eunos flyover and the last along Bedok North. Waited for more than an hour before my camp sent recovery. they managed to problem solve the vehicle and soon we were going back to Clementi.   After that ordeal, and after i finished camp, I went to find  Mei  at Taka to pass her CD. Had dinner at Mos Burger and also window shop around Kinokuniya and the shopping centre too. Left town at abt 9pm because i was really exhausted.   Today will be going cycling . Betta go and wash up liao..

      taking time now to write in camp during the lunchbreak. Today, my camp is having a mini Xcountry at Macritchie res. Kena arrowed to be one of the 5 ton Drivers so that means booking out late tonight.   Anway, met up  Lava  at his camp yesterday in the morning when i was having a detail to go to his camp. Afterwards, I met  An Gi Lin  and him again for dinner at PS. had a good heart to heart talk abt his plans in the future and some issues abt RC. Was glad that he seems to be prgressing better, slowly but steady. Wished that i had half as much confidence as he does. But that is him, and I am Me. who we are makes a diiference. Why do we need to follow in the same footsteps as others. Why can't i be unique?

      hmm.... just want to share something that Sis talked to me abt just now. She asked me to name 2 goals to be achieved by the month's end. thou i had a few goals in mind, I couldn't give a straight answer. For what is holding me back , you can say is a bit of fear. Fear of Committment. I admit, I have the tendency to commit into things be it work, army, family or even a relationship. What puts me off is a bad experience in the past which oftens haunts me.   HOw to think abt it, what are my goals really? Is it to be happy? be get a good partner and settle down? to repay my family for what they have done for me? The list can go on and on. But what uis realistic enough that I can accomplish in 2 weeks?  I haven't been recently thinking abt all these types of serious issues. I was busy de-stressing myself over the weekend with my friends' birthdays. Maybe it's time to wake up and smell the roses like they say. Have I been wondering in my dream for too long and forget to come back to reality?  Wah, that feels so much better after opening up.

      Just had my dinner, didn't go out today. Just wanted to spent my Sunday at home. Played my   LOTR VCDs, the Fellowship of the Ring and the two Towers   on my Computer. It is one of my favourite movies, and was such a joy to watch it back to back. the full 5 hours plus movies on my comp.   Anyways, Would like to thank Nutfairy for the wonderful bbq at Pasir Ris. was one of the bbqs that I didn't get my fingers dirty except with food. met up a lot of  RCY  kakees including  Lava . He picked me up from home before fetching  Wengz and XuanHui  at Whitesands. We didn't stay too long at the BBQ because most of us had other plans. Followed Lava to his home to get  Kat's  present. Then we drove back to Tampines to pass it to her. She Was still awake even thou it was late in the night. Had a small chat with her before leaving.   Lava then drove me back , talking abt some personal issues on the way. It is always my pleasure to " advise " and listen to his problems. For i beileve talking to someone abt the problem is so much better than bottling it all up inside . I know that from experience. I used to do that and it was so unhealthy. Luckily now, I got the guidings for the  LORD  and my of close Friends like Al f, Lava and An Qi Lin.    The night is almost over and a new day awits for me. Wonder what tests lay ahead for me? So far, I think i have done my best in getting to my goals. Have you today?  Lastly, I also been added to  the  Friendster  craze. My address is  kknight29@yahoo.com  , feel free to add me. ;)

      Heard of this phrase before? well, to me, I have to say yes! my feet is killing me right now. They are so painful from all the "  exercises  " from driving today. Esp since that I'm wearing normal PT shoes, it just adds insult to injury. Thought that being excused from boots would be better who knew that this was going to be so painful.   Maybe it is the first day, not so used to drive with it. Stalled engine 3 times somemore, because of the slippery surface between the shoes and the clutch pad. including 1 time with my officer. jia lat man.   Waiting for "  Charmed  " on Tv so blogging for the time being.  Enjoying my room's aircon while blogging. This is the life. But soon this pleasure will be gone and it's back to work and the cycles continue. Have you wished or wondered why is your life is as it is now? Have you ever wondered what esle you might be doing if life was different? For me, I would want a simple, laid back life (  just like the old kampung days ) where people knew how to REALLY enjoy life. But this is just a dream, whether it turns real , no one knows except for  HIM .  He  is the one who foresees our future, where we will be in 5, 10 years time. He created US and we are his children.   Will be kinda looking forward for tommorrow because i'm on leave again on Friday. Might try to call  Mei  out to celebrate her 21st Birthday. Haven't gotten her prezzie yet so maybe a simple dinner might make it up. If not, I might pop down to  Boon lay  to take a walk. No, i think I should go to  Raffles Place , Want to enjoy the night life along the singapore River.

      Hmm.... I hope that I have finally solved the picture issues..... thanks to all who commented.   today, spent the morning in camp before going for my Medical appointment at  Nat'l Skin centre . Went to  IMM  to have lunch as well as look for velgro that  Yusri  wanted. Then took the train to  Novena  before walking there. the consulation was fast and efficient. The Specialist who saw me was pretty young, and hahaha was soothing both to the eyes and ears.Still can remember her name, Dr Janice Cruz, a sweet lady.( hey don't get me wrong, I'm still a guy you know) She gave me some more prescritions to carry on and even got me a month excuse of wearing boots...(  Yeepiiii!!!!!)    Looked for the velgro at  Plaza Singapore  after the checkup. managed to get it after some searching. PS was pretty packed, think it is because of  Carrefour's  opening. Popped down to  Hq  for a while, Saw  An Qi, Shannen,  Ee Ling , Doreen and Nirmala .   Left Hq at abt 5:30pm and took 36 to parkway. Saw an old Red Cross friend on the way back. He just ORD in AUg and so enjoying life for the moment. reached home at 6 and decided to cycle. It has been a long time since i did that, the air was so refreshing and the view of the   sunset was simply breathe-taking  . The sun was shining in Orange-y Red. I really missed these types of moments where i could forget of all the activities that is happening and enjoy the wonders of Mother Nature.   When will I ever get this chance again. Once again, hope you can see the pictures and have a gd night.

      Got back to camp today feeling very tired. Went to 3 places today for detail with QM Dept. Visited Pasir  Laba, Stagmont and CMPB.  Finished at abt 3pm before slowing taking my time to wash my vehicle. Today MT Line was so quiet, the reason why, 2 of my "noisy" SSGs were not here. Hallelujah!.   Waiting for   Smallville  's finale later on. the actress playing Lona Lane is so cute... hahahaha... but I prefer Asian Girls. :) Tommorrow will be only in camp till noon. After which going to Skin centre for my followup session. Most prob will not be going for detail because of the timing but it is always hard to say. Life is so unpredictable.   wanna Wish  Ms Jenny  a sweet 21st Birthday today, Best Wishes to you . This is the 2nd birthday of the week, I 've still got 3 more to go this week.   Lastly, I like to add that something was wrong with my sunset pic so I've replaced with the charcoal one. how's my photo skills? Hope that my pictures in the right column is all ok.be back soon.

      Just finished watching "   Star Wars  " on Ch 5, one of my all-time fav movie. Recently re-mastered, the show still intrigues me.   First of, I would like to wish my Dad  a happy birthday. thanks for all you have done. Went to  ChinaTown Point  for lunch to celebrate. Saw  Wayne , my younger cousin who is in BMTC, and boy, has he slimmed down. Great Job ! keep it up. But before that, I went to  Han Wen's  church again. Was supposed to meet him but last min . he was not feeling well. "  Dear FATHER, please help Bro Han Wen have a speedy recovery  ." Still went for the service which talked abt  Nehemiah .  Went to meet  Alf  and  Pishu  after my family outing and soon was joined by  Jim  too. Wanted to catch a show but time did not permit, so played pool or a while at Marina.   As for yesterday, I think I kinda overdose on chicken. From Chicken wing to Sausages to Satay. That were the main food stuff at  Jenny's  BBQ. Will try to load more pictures soon. Got one showing yesterday's sunset. Had another one on the burning coal, looks nice. hmmm....Wonder if  Lava  is interested to see.  Shun Mei  said that she uploaded hers liao, maybe will go and take a look.    Tmr going back to camp, yet again the weekend passes so fast , and like what  Viz Sir  said in his blog; (As qouted) "  every soul yearns for them and many souls lost them again by the time of sunday moon. ahh.. weekends.. many times too often, we horded our evanescent weekends with trucks of activities driven by wheels on fire.. only to find that weekends are like incense  ." Thou I enjoyed my time during the weekend, this enjoyment is only temporary. What would be a permament solution? i wonder.

      Really feeling very pissed today, even thou it is the start of a new day. Got called to asked why I'm on Off and not on duty. It's a long story and a confusing one if I'm going to write it here.  Don't know why it is always like this when I'm on Off , this happens to me all the time. Why am I the only one who gets this kind of S@#* all the time, and not others. Really thinking of asking for a transfer again. Yes, that thought was in my mind for a long time too.   I was told that duties starts next Tuesday, but they gave me today. They say that I will be orientated this week, but they didn't because of the vehicle status of the ambulance. They say that they will replaced my duties with another colleague. Told them that I got something on today, they say ok. I had checked thru all areas of consideration before making the decision to take my Off this morning. So why do they say that I still need to report to camp. Is this so type of test that  HE  is trying to make me take and see if I pass my test. hmmm....  HE  only knows and the answer too.   Need to go out later on to buy some presents. a lot of people's birthday coming up this week. Will be spending quite an amount.   Anyways, watched " Underworld " with  Alf  and  Mr J  at Suntec. a So-so movie. a dark show to be exact. It seemed to me that the show is like a war of 2 types of people rather than 2 different kind of species. The rich high class socialites and the street-roaming thugs. you say?  Got an interesting email from my sis. It's a link of how well is your eyes. Click  urlLink here  to try the quiz. ( good for those who like photography)

      yeah, tried another different route to go back home. This time took the Express bus at Bukit Batok , only to find that it would take abt the same time if i took bus 196 or 14. well, at least it was a different scenery.   Tommorrow will be finally orientating on the L/R Ambulance. Will be a whole day affair. Furthermore, it is also finally payday. Really broke, so it feels so good to have some cash.   Added more pictures of me past and present. Some of my favourite pictures, which u can also find in my  urlLink picture album link .  ok, gtg... be back to blog soon.

      Kind glad tt it is already Wed. But so how, i wish it was not. Some things are in a mess in camp like my Ambulance Duty. Suppose to do from next Tuesday onwards but my staff put me on Sat, the day i want to use my long weekend. Furthermore, there is no ambulance for me to orientate on . very F*@# up ....   Don't know how la. On the bright side, i finally managed to put a picture of myself up. It's one of my fav. of me with me in my long hair and so "cute" smile hahahah....

      Just decided to take the longer way back home today, took the bus 196 then changing to bus 15 at Parkway. The whole journey took exactly 1.30 hrs to complete. Was treated to a cool lightning display by Mother Nature on the way. Everything seemed to go in slow motion. After half an hour in the bus, I was still only at Commonwealth.   Listened to Y.E.S. 93.3fm while on the bus. It was a good time to just " stoned " and look at what was going on. Be it the anxiety of people rushing to go back to the enjoyment of others sipping coffee at a near by coffeeshop.  It was definately a good "  to myself time " which i hope i will have more to come.   Have to say a Big Apology to my Red Cross friends esp to   nutfairy   for not being able to attend her 20th birthday. Doing Ambulance duty this month. And it so happened that most of the days I'm on duty, I got some outside appointment. Talk abt " Suai "....The only job point is I stay in for 2 nights and the next day is off and the cycle continues.   Another news is that I will be going for the  Driver Class I  course at Sembawang Camp. hmmm.... long time since I last went there. Wonder if I will see anyone I know.

      argh!... down with the cold and blcked nose.... what a way to enjoy my leave. so tempted to go report sick haha.   And for your info, I overslept today because of the rain and missed my walk. haiz  Came back from town just now after meeting up with  Jim and Michael  at  Suntec . Had a good sharing session with them on how Jim could improve on himself. People have been avioding him because of his attitude. I admit, I would be just like anyone esle and just leave him to rot by himself . Esp for all the things he done to me. Out of Pity, I trying my best to guide him back on track.  watched "  the Italian Job  ", my 3 movie in as many days. Was a pretty well filmed show, with shots from Venice. a place where i always wanted to go. Had lots of action too, with high speed chases with Minis. a show that you should watch.   The weekend is finally over for me and it's back to work tommorrow. the much needed break was a good de-stress-er. Thou mother nature played tricks on me , I enjoyed the company I spent with and the things that i did.

      wah, so fast already 1:30am .... luckily today I'm on leave...Cannot tahan in camp liao. Anyways, I really liked to thank Brother  Han Wen  for following me to come to his church service, his is the  Bartley Christian Church , as well as to his cell group session. Much Appreciated. May the Lord protect you and look after you as you go for your teeth operation.   the Service was an enjoyable one, liked the atmosphere and the people who i got to know. Such a lovely church. It was a more matured level of service, singing of hymns followed by a talk by one of the senior pastors before closing the day with a prayer.  As for the cellgroup, we took a bus to  Nee Soon  to Han Wen's CGL's house. spent abt 2 hours there. friendly people i got to know. Was really a comforting experience. Thought that i might feel awkward at first. One discussion we had was "  how you do define success  ?"  let me know your comments.  After that, I went to meet  Alf  at  Tampines mall  to watch another movie, "   Turn Left Turn Right  " . Since he wanted to watch it and that I didn't mind watching it again. Reached home after the show at abt 9:30pm. turned to HBO channel and watched " the  Last Castle " starring  robert Redford . a well filmed film. and you could sense what the motive of the film was. It was that you need not have authority to have power. But you have the power to authorize people. (  as in army terms, you need not be commissioned to lead a battlion, but you have the power to lead one )  ok, gtg... wanna catch the sunrise later. Missed walking by the beach, hope it will not rain later.

      It's pouring cats and dogs.... came back at 11pm. Walked from  Parkway  all the way back in the rain. Had a sudden urch to do it. Maybe I was trying to enjoy my first Weekend proper in almost 1 month. But it was almost not to be , my MT Line called me to go back camp to go drive for detail tommorrow morning at 5:30am. which is like I do not need to sleep tonight then lohs... so told them i can't go for it.  Earlier on, had detail in the morning to early afternoon. After washing up both the car and myself, i took 189 & 106 to orchard. Went down to find Jenny's present.  Alf, Shun Mei, Weilun and Jim  joined me , one by one. Got persuaded by Alf to watch "   American Pie , the Wedding  " And boy, it was worth the money, very comedcal . All i can says the show gives new meaning to the pharse " Eat Shit ".  Events to highlight since Wed is:  1.) went to a volunteer meeting at HQ on thurs. felt it was a bit waste of time because i kinda expected who will be there and who will not. Also, i had a suspicion that what will be said during the 1 hour session.  2.) Fri, wanted to go for a meeting at HQ but due to time constraints, i cannot make it. So ended up sms-ing   nutfairy   and jim  to see of they wanted to meet up.  Alf  called me then asked if I wanted to eat out. So met him too. Ended up saboing him to get nutfairy to give him a balloon in No. 4.  ;p   3.) Val bought a fighting fish for me. naming him  grumpy  because it looks grumpy in the small container. hahaha    better be sleeping liao, meeting  Hanwen  early to have  follow up session cum service and cell group meeting at his church. have a good nights. ( really broke , may fast to save money, waiting for next fro...haiz)

       Happy children's day  for those who are young at heart. (   i know i'm not, dun't want to lie to myself  )  Had just finished going thru my emails and checking out my friends' blogs. Today was another islandwide roaming day for me. Places like  Ponggol, Serangoon, Kaki Bukit, Tampines, Paya Lebar, Nat'l Stadium  was interesting to drive around. Didn't drive there much so far so it was quite an eye opener.Went to my Grandmother's house for dinner and saw  Mel and Girish , a sec sch friend , on the way there.   Yesterday, after camp, went to meet up  An Qi Lin, Lava, Ek , mocha and Xue  for dinner and Coffee.  Olio Dome  was our Round 1 stop where we had pizza, fries, calamari and wings. Round 2 was at the  Big 0  resteurant  with coffee and cake waiting for us there.   It was also  Mr Ang's  birthday. Best wishes to him.    As i was saying, it is the start of the new month, with new beginnings. No more are the days of duty drive for me, now it is duty ambulance. But with that, this comes new responsibilities. luckily this month i only have 1 weekend duty. which means i will be trying to burn my weekend doing stuff that i have long never touched / done.   The world is like a box of chocolate, they say, you don't know what to expect. Well, expect the unexpected for you can never judge a book by its cover. In my 22 years on this earth, I met so many different types of characters from my time in sec sch and poly, to when i'm helping out in my red cross to even my working experience at Pizza hut and in the army.   there is one thing i know, you can never trust anyone even yourself. I know i may be sounding a bit out of the point but i think you get what I'm trying to say. Life is fulls of ups and downs, you can depend on familyand friends to be there to assist you, but ultimately, it is yourself that has to do the thing.

      Haiz, why does time fly so fast when you are having fun.   Today after i gone back and wash up, I went to meet  Pishu  to look for a birthday present for our dear Brother  Alfian . Searched thru  Beach Rd, Suntec  before finding the ideal one for him at  Millenia Walk . Cost abt 80+ but i think it is worth it.   Proceeded to  TKSS  for the unit's bbq. Found the juniors going out to get the food items from one of their house. Once that was over, we headed back and started preparing for the bbq. Enjoyed myself with the food, company and entertainment that was lined up. sabo-ed a few people with cream but i got my retribution too. Well, it was fun. Was even rewarded with a token of appreciation by the teacher. it was a small Hp holder in a heart shape.   okays, it is way past midnight. before I forget,   Selamat Hari Raya Aldifitri   to all my malay  kawans .......

      yoz, I'm back from my duty off n soon I'm going back to camp. Just came from HQ, had a super long meeting abt our district camp which is just 3 weeks away.   Was actually surprised that  Broz  turned up. Found out that he was not well but still wanted to come. Bought him an advanced birthday cake in case i don't see him these few days. Anyways, Also managed to print out my own namecards at Bras Basah. Went to Bugis to window shop while waiting. Had lunch with  Mei  too at her work place after i book out this morning.  think the next time you will hear me is either on Sat( i doubt so) or on Tues ( Hari raya) . take cares.

      The quiz below was from Dorl. hee... not sure if it is true or not.   got back from Jurong Not long ago. Had dinner at  Jurong Point  after getting activated.  was called up by an automated system at around 2pm+ before proceeding to my MPH to register. only managed to leave at abt 5pm until all personnel was accounted for. This was my first such mobilisation. my codename was "  Poison Ivy  ", just like the villianess / plant.    Anyway, tommorrow is going to be a long day. Helping out at  PRCL  at  Haw Par Villa . After that, I'll be rushing to my Grandma's birthday dinner.  Going to surf the net now n be watching some tv. Catch you soon. Oh ya , starting my ambulance duty for real these 2 weeks, so that means only every 3 days then i may blog. Take care!

      on 24 hours standby this weekend because of   Mob Manning  . Suppose to report back to camp within the hour once they give the signal. I wonder when it will be? I pray that it is not on Sun as my Grandma's birthday is on that day.   Tommorrow still got run so lucky that i can book in civilian. Got so many programmes this 2 days but because of this standby, I'm not able to commit myself to any as yet until the event is over. Good thing my stuff are all ready. Just need to go back, scan my 11b n report back to Mt Line. hope that it is fast and easy. *crossed fingers*

      I'm back and yeah, n had a fruitful Day Off. Started by getting my hair trimmed at Eunos, followed by getting my new Nets card done at Parkway. Proceeded by going down to HQ to have lunch with  An Qi Lin, Shannen, Huang Chiet, Peter, Richard n Dor .   Took the expressbus to Tampines Mall to look for an old poly friend. Had a photo-taking frenzy on the way there. Experimenting with different effects and modes. Will show them to you pplz soon. Managed to find her after a long search and chatted briefly.   the next stop for me was Bedok. Went to find  Jim  to see gow he was doing. Saw  Nutz  working at her outlet. Stayed there till abt five before heading back to Parkway to "  ling kopi  " and more picture taking.    The night is almost over n soon it's back to work. Luckily I've got a medical appt again to can leave camp early. If I'm lucky and time permits, Might be able to send  Pandaz  off. oh my, it's really getting late, and the bed is calling me to it. Nights!

      oh man, it's only wed and I'm already starting to feel so tired . Last 2 days had been physically exhausting. Had my Ambulance orientation, then went for detail, Went driving around to homevisit and even went for a recovery. All in these 2 days. Like tommorrow, I might even have to stay in because of a evening detail. MT line is short of drivers right now and most of the " old birds " are suffering. The only bright side of these 2 days was visiting my alma mata,   Broadrick Sec   to visit the Red Cross unit's campfire. I think that would have been my 15th campfire in my last 8 years.    Wengz  sms-ed me yesterday to say tt  Weiji  asking of want to watch   Matrix Revolutions   on sat. This , is not the movie I'm waiting for, the one I would kill for will be "   Return of the King  ". LOTR rules!!!!.   5 more days to  pay day , I cannot wait. my 2 claims is coming in. Huuray!!! my third claim can be submitted by end of the month as now i'm currently short of only 300+ km. Should be able to cover these few days.   Anyways, Just want to say that in recent weeks, i may not blog too often because this month is an alert red period for my unit. 24 hours recallable. well, Just have to bear with 8 more months liao. by year end, I will be able to count down properly. Hee!

      Watched one of my all time favourite trilogies - STA R WaRs  epsiode 5 on Ch5 just now. it never cease to amaze me with their special effects and awesome filming.   Today, spent the whole morning at Han Wen's Church. went for the service as well as help them out as ushers. After that, I went down to Parkway to kill time before meeting Weilun up for   Kill Bill  . a pretty lame, funny and bloody show. That's why it is RA.  Yesterday, had a long weekend because i finished my course early. Met up Lava and Huang Chiet for a gym session at CCk Sports hall. Had lunch with PS and then took a bus to see my sister's exhibtions. Shirley joined us over there. This was followed by a mini photography trail till we reached funan. That was where we went our separate ways.  As for Fri, during course, we learnt how to operate the crane and winch of a 5 ton. In the evening, i rushed to meet the rest at HSA. Managed to wear my costume for awhile before the event ended.  Tommorrow , will be going back to Clementi, feeling a bit reluctant because that means more driving. oh well, better rest now.   by the way, i added a new link which i hope you guys will visit. It is an online photo gallery with pictures from lava, shirley and myself. click at "   urlLink bringing still to life   " . :)

Slept pretty " early " this morning at 2am. Went out with some friends till the wee hours of the morning.   Will be trying to find time to tidy my room before going out in the afternoon. Then , i am going to HQ for meeting. Anyways, here were some majors happenenings that i did over the last few days.  1.) It was  Alfian's and Chiu weng's  birthdays on the 24th. didn't managed to meet them because I was on duty. 2.) Hari raya on the 25th. Spent time with my sister to watch "  Looney Tunes " 3.) 28th , went to campsite to help out at the East West Link camp. enjoyed the " superstar " performances of the emcees and the campfire. 4.) Went to sentosa for family day cover.

      feeling really terrible today.... having quite a bad case of the gastric pains. Felt like throwing up on the train  but thank goodness i didn't. Went to report sick and all i got was some tabulets to take 3 times daily.   Anyways, the New year is over just like that .... nothing much changes in the last few years. only 1 thing and 1 thing only, our family is leaving the house much much later from previous years. did my fair share of snacking on goodies, *not sure if my stomach paid the price of been greedy* as well as visiting my relatives.  Met up some Red Cross pals in the weekend to visit thou at one place i lost abt $5 at a game of mah jong. Did enjoyed myself and now it's time to get busy.  Saw my next month forecast and boy i guessed correctly. Arrowed for Ambulance duty. that 2 days in camp , 1 day off procedure for the whole month. at least, i can save some $$$ while in camp. ICT starting tommorrow, going for orientation with the NSmen. Wonder where we be going this time. Quite a good sign that i'll be at medical centre instead at Mt Line for the next 3 weeks.   Also received a call from one pal of mine regards to some Red Cross news. He was thinking of getting me to hold an appointment role for one major event coming up. Told him sounds fine but my schedule might clash.   Well, actually got more things on my mind to voice out but i definately need a rest for the "butterflies" in my stomach. it has been hard travelling with the vomitting feeling in your gut.

      Just finished clearing and cleaning up my room for the new year. this was however at the expense of my sensitive nose. * think i used up to 2 boxes of tissues* The room looks still the same, actually wanted to shift the furniture but lack and time and manpower. The good thing is that i cleared lots of old notes and docs and rubbish dating back to almost 10 years ago. Threw most of my sec sch and poly notes that was stockpiling at one corner. Used abt 10 rubbish bags to dispose my stuff.   The place seems neater but is taking the same amount of space. duh!. Well, at least it was worth the leave i took to clear my room. sad thou, that my day is not completed because i can't go out to pay my hp bills or finish buying my New Year clothes, thanks to the rain. Lacking one more shirt and a pair of Jeans. Hope got time to buy tommorrow..last day.  The highlights for the week gone by was:  1.) my Grandpa's birthday on last Wed, held at his fav resturant at Marine Parade.  2.) my MTL had a bbq cum chalet at costa Sand at East Coast on Sat. Most of my colleagues came but i only stayed for a while.  3.) yesterday , went back to ULu Pandan CC for the 2nd pt of the talentime. I have to say that the cadets' creativity and artistical talents never stop to amuse me. I saw some of the most realistic acting in my life by someone so young. maybe they shld try Singapore Idol auditions. heee   Will have more things to post soon.

      Actually wanted to say lots of things but decided to postponed it to a later date. Today was not my best of days. Had a sudden attack of sneezes this whole day, think my count so far was close to 50. * is that bad?* oh man, and to think that the world is getting sicker by the moment with all these epedemics coming up.   Also got the news that i had to be in Nee Soon by 6am tmr morning is not helping me either. Eap since it is going to be my grandpa's Bday. Already missed my last 2 grandparents' BdAys, and if i'm not able, it is going to be a hat trick. Well, I guess, it is up to the Lord to show what is installed for me.   i admit that i'm not the type of person who can concentrate well and really appreciated my  Broz  Han Wen for guiding me in my journey in realising Christ.  It has been an Up-and- Down struggle for me because i have been lagging in my weekly trips to churches and my reading of the Bible. Thank you Broz for your consent and your detemination in leading me to the right pave.   God bless.

      hmm.... couldn't think of a title for today's blog. This past week had been an interesting journey. Went back to my old unit and saw  lots of changes since i last step in. Met old friends there and shared a joke to two with new ones. those 3 days went by so fast. Just like this is almost coming to the middle of the first month of the new year.  took over duty on friday for a sick colleague but was satisfied because i wanted the long weekend.  The weekend was mainly focused on my red cross committments for the schools' Sec 1 CCA open houses. Wore my white U for the first time in almost 6 months. a bit tighter now...hahaha time to lost weight!  Yesterday, went to Ulu pandan to see the future idols of Singapore. It was Talentime again and it was inspiring to see so many talented cadets. Using their skills and the charm to woo the judges. a pity that i'm not unable to see the second part of the show next week.. haiz...  nvm..... telling my self that only less than 170 absolute days left to ORD!....hahahaahha

      today is feb 29. a day that only appears once in every 4 years. shldn't it not be quite a special day ? Not for me. It is not that i don't appreciate it but these few weeks doing ambulance duty made me feel that it is just an ordinary day.   Only entertainment was going to meet a few friends for cycling in the afternoon. Might be watching tv later on. Just like any other sunday. But I'm really glad that the end is over, that means 1 more month closer to the Big 3 letters.   give me an "O" ,   "O" !  give me a "R" ,  "R" !  give me a "D" , "D" !  what does that spell? ORD, ORD , ORD  loh.   ;p

      Yeah, the district footdrill competition was a huge success. thought that everyone did their best thou as expected there was the occassional hiccups. Rushed down to CHIJ STC as soon as i could that day. Missed most of the actions as I was the score tabulator. So was stuck at the classroom area. Saw a few faces that i have not seen for a long time too. Old friends and teachers that i used to work with. My, hasn't time fly? After the event, I accompanied some of the juniors to Swensen's to celebrate a few people's birthday coming up this week. And what a meal it was. my pants almost  burst .( OopS .... too X-rated..hahaha)  Anyway, at least one event is down for me this year. But it is the start of many to Come. ACOC, VI Programme, World Red Cross Day and Nat'l Day.   It is coming to the end of the month, can't wait for pay day again. really low on $$$. How to survive after ORD? been saving up but it is still below $S1K.  nights!

      yeah!, got my hair really short today. i lalways like my hair like this. save money on shampoo, water. hahhaha. ......out of point!  Partly in preparations for this Sat's  District Footdrill Competition . This is the start of a few Red Cross events in the year. Wonder if I got enough leave or off that i can use or that i can even use or not.   Anyway, today i also went back to   Broadrick  , my alta mata. Helped  Evelyn  to supervise & train the cadets for the coming competition. Was a bit disappointed in the way they are behaving , half of them are not really interested in putting any effort in the training. haiz.   i think the "kids" are too pampered or too well off. recently, there is a trend of pri sch students carrying Nokia phones like 6610,8310,7250,etc... and esp with the camera too. My time, i only got my pager after sec 4. and only upgraded it after i finish poly.   Don't say that i'm been paranoid but i really wonder if the students really know the meaning of hardship. take our grandparents, they still teasure the things that they bought, even when they are worn out and old. my grandma had a heated argument with my mum when she almost wanted to throw away her old cupboard.  well, shall try not to dwell in the past and look into the future. the future looks bright. Best wishes for me and you. Good Nights!

      hmm... long time nv blog . need to find the right momentum to get it done.   Had a good long coffee session with  Ah-Lun, Frances and Jenny  at Coffee Bean. Just like last week, it was a worthwhile " talk cock " ( pardon my language) the 3 above phrases were off from a book which Weilun bought called the " Book of Answers ". as we sat, we each took turn to think and ask a question, then flip to a page of the book and that will be the answer to our question. Quite an interesting experience.  This 2 weeks has been busy for me, with my ambulance duty in camp, using my Off days for either red cross stuff ( esp since the  District Footdrill Competition  is this Sat.) or meeting my old friends like  Weilun, Pishu, Jenny, Frances and Shun Mei .   At this moment in my life, I'm heading for a milesone. Soon part of my army days will be over and i need to look ahead. Have already confirmed that I will be redoing my Dip at TP. went to the Openhouse and asked a few questions. There is a few obstacles in this area which i got to work out. Just pray that the  Lord  will guide me in this, as i have trusted and believe in the things that he can do for us.   More news soon. God Bless.

      yeah... my dinner tonight is 6353535 aka pizzahut. Had a sudden craving for either sushi or pizza. Decided pizza becoz it was more filling.   Surfing the net now, doing some testimonials for my friends via   friendster  . Just doing that becoz that is basically nothing esle much to do right now. it is interesting really not how many friends you got, but rather how many people really know you exist and treasure you being here on this planet. Actually found so long poly friends, Red Cross friends and other friends from here.    on the subject of friendster, while on duty last 2 days in camp, my army pal  Tham  and I surf the net and so happen that i went to my friendster account. We actually discussed this interesting point that I was actually interested to find out the reason too. He saw that most of my friends were of the opposite sex(  abt 75% ) and he asked why i had so many female friends and I'm still single. AHAHAhaa.....true and amazing right? anyone got a clue?  coming to the end of the month, and soon it's April. one of my most dreaded month in my driving career. It's inspection time and there are lots to do. heard that i'll be pulled back to my MTL so now my pre-planned schedule is in a mess again. This month is a dreaded month becoz no one plan take leave or Off (  unless it's on duty ). So i'm in a cloud on my schedules for the next 4 Sats ( all  dates I got a Red Cross event )  today, watched  Scooby Doo 2  with a couple of old friends. haven't met them for almost 2 months liao. everyone is so busy, it's so diffucult to get all. Pretty much enjoyed the whole show, lots of computer graphics and action. No one can deny the antics of   Scooby, Shaggy, or Vilma   (  is that the correct spelling ) , their innocent blunters created much havoc in the town of   Coolville   (  what a town name ) . a definate Must watch.

What a way to spend my day off. luckily I'm used to this way of life. Just wondering will i ever stop . hmmm... one very interesting question.   Anyways, the weekend is reaching soon. Have fun enjoying yoursellf.

      Stuck in camp for the whole weekend. feeling pretty bored and sian right now. Played with my friendster and did some testimonials for my friends. I just hate Sundays. there is nothing much on TV in the afternoon . ONly waiting for  a Bug's Life  later on.   been Pretty busy the last 2 weeks. From the  ACOC  trainings, to the VI camp to my NDP internal trainings to the  World Red Cross Day  preparations. On top of that , my ambulance duties which has seen mi going to NUH once in every 3 days. And the waiting time there is like ..... uncommendable.   Today is the  Nat'l Footdrill Competition . Wonder how it is going on. This is the first time in my 6 years in HQ that i missed the competition. Shall call one of the rest to find out the results. Hope there is some surprises.  Down with a slight cough and blocked nose recently. been feeling not too gd lately just recovered from cough, flu and a sore throat last week. Maybe it is the medical centre. pretty busy these few days because of the exercise and what Happened to Tekong. Kinda silly right? 3 guys fleeing to Tekong with only 1 pistol. There is like 5,000 + people in Tekong, X no. of  M16s, SAR21s , SAWs  in the armouries. thank God thou that all 3 men were caught. Almost got activated because of it. Actually was wondering if the loot is hidden in Tekong. Suddenly the recruits having field camp , then dig the trench and saw the loot. hahahaaha... ok.. talking rubbish already. duh!  Looking for motivation these days, seriously lacking it. Anyone can help?

         Finally can managed to find some time to check my mail and rest. Today has been my most busiest day at the Medical Center to date. Sent 7 reservists to NUH starting from 11:30am to just now abt 9:00pm. Luckily managed to get some bite over there, if not , i will be one hungry and angry driver.   Saw someone whom i have not met for a long time,  nutfairy . She was waiting for her medical appt at NUH too. Didn't chat long because i had to be with the medics and the reservists.   Will be booking out tmr, yeah.. can go and settle my NDP and World Red Cross Day matters at hq. might be meeting  lava  for lunch at Beach rd after i go and source for my log stuff.   oh man, i stink. can smell the odour coming out from my no.4 Uniform. Sad thou, i cannot change to my admin tee because one of the silly medics, i think , took it to play games when i was gone. *^&(&%*....   these 2 weeks going to be very tight on my schedule, rushing to NDP trainings , meetings and events after booking out of camp.So if i do not blog, pai seh la.

      still in camp now, leaving pretty soon to meet Mei and mike at Suntec. After that, will be going down to Costa Sands East Coast for Freddy's bday. And I still haven't gotta him anything yet. Let's see if there is something that i can pick for him.  These few days outside of camp have been busy with frequent trips down HQ to settle the NDP trainers list and the World red Cross day log stuff. Going to be a tiring 2 months for me. And esp from my army pals and family, they wondered why i do all of these hings for. Is it for the money, the experience, the company or etc..?  and my answer to them is abt 1 word:   PASSION.   my love in doing these things that can and will bring a smile to others. That was the main reason why i am still so actively involved in the RCY. It is my pleasure to make people smile and that is why i chosed to do Volunteer work.   anyway, it's abt time i leave. till we next meet.

      haiz, can you believe tt lightning struck thrice & not twice to my colleague and me. for the 3rd time in 3 months, 2nd in 2 weeks tt Ops was activated when both of us were doing duty. first was the Tekong incident, then last week's tragedy and then yesterday's disaster. why has so many things have happened in this first third of the year. is there any meaning to all this?   today on my super long weekend. my first in a long time. that's the gd news. the bad news is that my application to TP results are back and it was unsuccessful. pretty sad abt it but i guess i got to move on. now considering the other possibilities. from going to try SP, NYP, NP 's diplomas in business, to going to private uni or even working. i think thou i will have a short break first, then work and study pt time. Waiting to discuss with my dear family abt it first before i make one of the most important decision in my life.   well, if it's meant to be, it's meant to be. That's all i think i can right now. Have a good May Day. ;)

            You are a Duke!  Honourable, Courageous, Just!  You are the voice of reason against tyranny, a leader among men, and you fight for what is right.    After the King, (and Prince) you are the most noble of all nobles. With your charisma, strength, wisdom, and ability to gain respect & loyalty of others - you have risen far in life or will rise far. You live for what is right & just. Honor and morality are very important to you. You are the King's right hand and the one all other men look upto after their King.

      2 more duties / 3 more days to the end of Apr. tt's means no more Ambulance duties. "freedom" !!!!!!   Not exactly ya, still got to suffer for abt 1 more month before I can enjoy myself. Not to mention my planning of the things to come. I.e. my future. things seemed so good for me so far and I really have to thank the LORD for making my journey in 2PDF a smooth one. Pretty Fortunate that I didn't get activated for 2 OPs cases; the Tekong and Nicoll Highway incidents. Also very grateful for not getting all the difficult and "dirty" details within the last few months. Lastly , getting to meet some many wonderful friends who had been there with me as we suffered together during duties.   okays, enough of camp. Now to Red Cross and NDP. Last Sat's SC training went well with only a few hiccups. Spirits were high before and after the trainings as both cadets and instructors enjoyed themselves. They Sung, and cheered and Screamed to their hearts' content competing with the fellow UGs at Khatib Camp. The Actual training wise was a more stricter affair. Shall not comment much except that the cadets will have to work slighly harder if they want to represent the society.   oh man, it's already 6+ . only left with another 12 hours to go before it's back to camp. Speaking of which; I wasted abt $25 today because i forgot to return my duty room's keypress keys which a colleague passed to me to hold onto. So i had to travel all the way back to camp to pass it back. to think that I'm on a tight budget, this situation has further strained my finances. oh well, that's life. full of surprises that no one can foresee.    looking forward for my long weekend. seeya again. :)

      yeah, that is what I 'll be going thru the next 2 weeks. these 2 weeks are jammed packed with things to do. From my NS Duty, to my other army committments to my Red Cross stuff as 2 major events are coming up soon.   As usual, after book out today ( only managed to book out at 11am becoz something happened in camp) I went to HQ to settle some admin matters. Then i popped down to Beach Rd to buy a peak cap because of my new promotion. Followed by this was a trip to PArkway to buy some logistics from GIANT!.   luckily, for tommorrow & Thurs I can book out because my MT Line needs us Class 1 drivers to orienate the reservists. Hope can finish early for these 2 days. Missed my comfort of home since doing my Ambulance duties.   Ok dinnertime, TakE CAr3s!!!!

      *****"sigh" ****   only 4pm , still got abt 48 hours more to go in camp. luckily Sunday duty pretty relaxed, no one in camp except those on duty like me. not sure how am i going to survive this. Got to bear with another 2 months before i get into my "mood" . Once this month is over, I'm pretty much relaxed because another 2 events will be thru. left the promotion ceremony and the WRCD celebrations to go before i can concentrate on my NDP .   Pity I can't go for the 2 events because i'm still on duty. esp the WRCD one, because i haven't miss any celebrations for almost 6 years +. can remember the times at the Jurong Bird Park or even the Zoo when i first joined the HQ. I was so excitied over that day like i would for National Day. But the one at TAmpines Stadium 2 yrs ago was the most memorable. It was really the sort of the old fashion style parade with special guest performances. Thou I can't be there physically, i pray that I'll be there in spirit. and may the event be a huge success like yesterday's bazaar.  Don't know what i should do now. Waiting for the 7pm movies to start. Maybe i might catch a few winks first.

      yup!, that was my stall's name at the Singapore Red Cross Society's International Bazaar 2004. Held at the S'pore Expo, it's the first time it was held indoors. And luckily it was, esp with the recent downpours and hot weater taking turns to run havoc in Singapore. Had rushed down from camp straight there .   together with a few new volunteers, we run a stall "Draw or Lose" . It 's a cross between "Win, Lose or Draw" and "Pictionary" where 2 public personnel will play. one would pick a card with something to draw and the other person would have to guess.  Business was pretty slow , but it's ok. Because at least we are still making a bit to help the society. Was quite interesting to see the young children trying to draw different objects with some much "skill" . kinda reminds me of myself when i used to like sketching. Lots of my cadets whom i taught before turned up and was actually having a ball of a time competiting with one another.   Was also kinda "Conned" by other cadets to give in to buy the things we were selling. from Biscuits, to cakes ; from games to play to even buying orchids. can you imagine that. cannot beat their sheer determination they have or the look of guilt i would have if I didn't buy from them.  My lunch was Pizza from the Italian embassy while dinner was hot dogs from Hard rock cafe. Broz alf and Broz Law also turned up and we even took a gp pic as it was quite to see the 3 of us together for a long time because all of us are in camp.   Sunday duty tommorrow or today in abt 15 mins. followed by Mon duty and Tues' work day because in camp in going on. My next off will be on Gd Friday. So till then , hope this is long enough.

      the time is almost here.... can you hear it? the smell of my Pink IC is getting stronger by the day as May ends and June comes. The last 25 days of my army life is here. the final hurdle to freedom.   The anticipation is great but the only joy will dawn on 26 June. the day I ORD . Can't wait for it man, for 2 yrs have i missed the sight of this handsome guy on the pink card. Hahaha (BHB)   Anyways, I managed to move around without my cast.cannot put too much pressure on the foot yet and it still needs to be bandage up but the feeling of walking without the cast is pure joy. made a brief stop to Parkway to get my hair cut before i return to camp on Thurs. After that, i accompanied my mum to get my passport extended for my trip to Bangkok at the end of the month.   Things are kinda looking up for the moment after a short fall, and as I saw in today's newspaper , a famous quote from Mr Winston Churchill; " Success is going from failure to failure without the lost of enthusiam." I totally agreed with what he said. In life , there can be many shortfalls but it is how you turn that shortfall into an opportunity that keeps us motivated. no matter what you do, where you do it, as long as you beileve  you can make it, you will.   Now, i must concentrate in getting my self well fast so that I can fulfill all of my committments for June.

      has it already been 5 days since i had my foot in a cast. yeah it has. and thou i told myself that I should rest at home and recuperate, so call "enjoy" my time at home. I can't help feel down. This feeling of been crippled, not been able to do the things that you want and can do comes down very hard . to think that i was going to be on leave by today to do my personnel stuff, this really SUCKS!..  the only reward i get out of this incident is the specialised care of my loved ones. I appreciate all that they have done for me these last few days. now i trully understand the feeling of being loved so deep. I often took things for granted and was kinda been brought up been the " spolit-brat" . Quarrelling wif both my parents and sister at times, not even thinking that they may be facing more stressed than me.   I have taken the few days to look back and see what are the things that i need to change and how am i going to change. The world doesn't revolve around me but I do. time to throw away all the past luggages and concentrated on the future. If i don't get things done, who will? I'm coming to the end of my NS liability and soon will be facing the harsh reality of the working world.   hmmm.... tommorrow will be going for my follow up at CGH. wonder what will happen then. really dying to get this cast off me , man. such a kill-joy. think this lesson taught me to be less "gay kiang" and be more careful of my old injuries. till we meet again.... seeya.

      Silly..... silly......  that's the one word that best sums up my day today. the reason why? been kinda "gay kiang "ar ... and now my foot is in a cast.   Fractured my right toe/foot in the late morning when i fell pretty hard on the floor while disembarking my 5-tonner at Safti Military Institute for an exhibition. At first ,it was a bit swollen only and i thought nothing much abt it. only after i was going to my Red Cross HQ for a meeting that i felt the pain getting worse. Stopped over to watson's to get some medications and bandage, however, tt didn't worked too well.   my last resort was getting my parents to send me for an x-ray to confirm my suspicions. True enough at CGH, the specialist told me a had a small fracture at my fourth toe head. and had a cast done for me.   And to think that i was going to clear my leave and offs by this coming wed. Not sure if i change them now.. also wonder if this is a blessing in disguise or what. somemore, i had previously fractured the same foot like 4 years ago? what luck......haiz!  Now, I'm going to miss a lot of important stuff planned for these few days. from NdP training to my meetings and other committements. looks like i've got to rot at home for this whole week. darm it..   ok, need to rest liao.... those interested are free to pop down to sign my cast. ;)

      hmmm... not sure if anyone esle heard of that before. but for NSFs and regulars, tt can be one thing. Someone is either going in (DB), posting out or the best of all........ORD!  Today , went to Tuas Naval base for my dental checkup togeher with 2 other friends. Actually saw 2 old bunkmates of my Leopard section 2 at the place. they haven't changed one bit. lately, i have the tendency to meet people i have not seen for as long time.   When i returned to camp, i went to look for the QM personnel to sign my clearance forms... luckily, we got most of them. so it looks like smooth sailing for my ORD.   38 more days to go, 16 more working days left. OrD , ORD, ORD Hor!

      i kinda had this feeling that this blog is not going to survive soon. esp after my tight work schedule. i thought this month was going to be pretty much more relaxed as i'm going to clear my leave at month's end. i thought wrong. In fact it seems more busier than normal. Maybe in the fact that many drivers have ORD-ed already and so, we are a bit short of manpower. I have only just gotten back from camp not too long ago. and to think that i actually woke up at 4:30am this morning to report to camp. it's maddness ,man.   Well, i have been telling myself that "it's only 18 more workdays to go. you can do it."  hmm... last few days key pts:  1. Birthdays: Shun Mei, Wendy, Desmond, Shannen have celebrated theirs. Now it's coming to Eng Kee, Xuan hui , Huang Chiet n SPL. wonder if i will get to see them these few days. if not, i'll dropped them a message.  2. my grandparents' wedding anniversary. soo happy to see them celebrated their 61st anniversary and may they get to celebrate much more. God Bless them.  3. went for the NDP Mass briefing and saw a few familiar faces /  okays, shall take a quick nap to recuperate myself.

      just finished bathing. Had some old friends popped down for a mini bbq. reminising on old times and how much we have changed within the last 5 years. Other than the rest of the Red Cross Kakees, these 6 people are the ones who has known my Ups and Downs  and they have always been there for me. I can gladly put an arm on them and say "friend".   a pity that most of us are busy; the guys in NS and the gals working. So it was very hard to meet up often and normally it's me who does the arrangements. Decided to have the bbq at my place because it's a place where there are not much distrations and we can save a bit of money in this way.   kk.... tmr another busy day .. I'm outta herez...

      hmmm... can't today is almost over. Maybe it is because i woke at 12nn. Boy , was i tired. Yesterday's rehearsal was pretty bad, lots of casualties to look after esp because of the hot weather and the drills were more sloppy than last week's. Can see that the cadets are trying their best , however, it's sad to say that still not good enough to impress the SAF enciks. I'm still pondering on how to motivate them to give their best. seeing them now is like seeing them forcing themselves to do something that they do not like to do. then in the evening, something happened as a junior and I were going home. Have to say a real "Sorry" to her for scaring her out. promised her it will be my last one.  Anyways, tmr's my special day, but it seems going to be like any other day. got no special plans except in the evening while i'll be having dinner with my close family. Then after that, might be meeting up Angi and Ms Teo for drinks. Got no one special to accompany me or surprise me tmr but I'm fine with that. kinda used to this isolation thingy for these last few years. maybe u can say that i have a fear of committment now or just plain unlucky. But i beileve i will find the ONE soon ...... only the LOrd can tell.   today's also a friend's birthday : " Happy 19th Birthday , Gal!"  ( if u can see this)   it's time to go, sayonara......

Thanked most of my friends and specs who helped me these last few months and left. Drove down because i was late, overslept today. thankfully my mum allowed me to drive there.   will be meeting law and a few others later to go for a friend's birthday chalet. so will be leaving soon.

      saw this saying somewhere the last  few days and it hit very close to home on me.  As another chapter of my life closes, a new one begins to unfold. It's just one of the few surprises that Life brings into our lives. Changes for the better or worse , it's not up to us to decide , but we can help make these setbacks into opportunities. For there's a rainbow after a downpour.  The week is almost halfway thru and I'm hope that it will move even faster. Cannot wait for my short break overseas. a time to destress from all my army and Red cross work committments.   tonight got another meeting to attend to. can't beileve that i'm actually more busy during my leaves than when i'm Not. Argh! But i shall not complain too much. For this is what i like to do, this passion in my heart to do this line of work is one that i hope will never go out . that's why i'm still surviving all these while.   until the next time, catcha ard.

      hmm... doesn't this sound familiar to some. yes, it is. the song from last yr's marching contingent introduction. Already the middle of June, soon it's gona be the actually day. Later going down to Hq to settle more admin matters, followed which i need to go down orchard to get some things for a good pal of mine. His birthday is coming, only this weeekend. wonder what shld i get.   Hopefully, tommorrow's training will be better than the last. The cadets are still not showing their full potential. Need to stick it in their minds that it's NDP and not jsut a parade. they got to show their best, show why Singapore is our home.   write more things in the evening. gottta wash up .

      The weekend has started for me already. Clearing my leave  again tommorrow but I/ve still gotta go back camp to sign my Off pass. So fool misplaced the booklet after i had written on it. Need to get my changes in Offs signed fast so that i can enjoy my break from army. Praying hard that my camp pals find the pass tommorrow , if not, i really do not know what to do ya.    Helping Huda and a few other cadets teach FA to a group of Primary sch students in the early afternoon. Will be doing some bandaging and teaching of the triangular bandage for the 100 + little ones.  Oh Man! did i mention tt also got last min news that my NDP training is starting an hour earlier. So tempted to shout some vagularities at SAF for the last min changes buut i cannot be bothered. I have gotten used to these type of "sabo" and is in fact a gd way of accessing how you can reposition yourself to make things for the better.   True that the main concern is the welfare of our cadets, there are only 14-16 yrs old. they are not adults. Do you think they will listen to you if you ask them to have their lunch at abt 10:00-10:30am before reporting? i dun think so. This generation of cadets still need to spoonfeed them a bit before you can get them to know how to fend for themselves.   Anyways, i'll feedback to the P&C of the NDp2004 abt these ridiculous changes. Hope the outcome of the circumstances is worth the while. After NDP this sat, I gotta rush down to campsite for another camp. In charge of Logistics again, maybe i shld do this as a busniess opportunity..who knows, it may even work... the camp going to last until Tues evening. What a weekend it's going to be. see ya in abt a week's time. peace out!

      feeling pretty down & tired recently for no apparent reason. maybe it's just the stress of a hectic weekend coming up within the next 2 weeks. Energy level has come to a new low, esp after so many years, i think age has caught up with me. Must do something abt it. Need a real "Perk-mi--up".   last few days have not been going out so often except the usual trip down to HQ to settle NDP & iwate stuff. these 2 projects already giving me a big headache. Must thank Shannen for assisting me in these. Tomorrow is Preview & in less then 11 days, we are celebrating our Nation's Birthday. Hope that transportation will be good. if not, I seriously do not know to send the cadets back & face their parents' wraith. a pity Law is overseas and will miss the Preview. oh well, guess that he should be enjoying his Summer camp there with the rest of the delegates.   As for Iwate, they are coming in a week's time and still have to worry abt the home stay thingy. Popping down to schools in the morning to talk to a few YOs. then will have to rush down to HQ.   Dorl invited a few of the instructors for bbq-cum-chalet @ east coast too . will see how the timing before deciding if we are gng down. luckily Mum let me have the car. Whew! may stay over night then rush down to Bartley to go for first / second service depending on the time i can wake up.   Might be going down to Marina Area for the Fireworks display with a few others too on Sunday evening. but that's KIV till then. Bet there will be a full house everywhere as no one wants to miss such a display.   gonna wash up & have lunch liao.. and ponder abt things a bit..   ** have i lost my purpose in life? can anyone tell me?**

        "The Real Deal" - Actual delegates going.    "The Wannabes" - Hopeful Volunteers trying to get a last min invitation   HaHaha... more pictures uploaded liao. This time was on the sending off of our RCY delegates going to Korea for a week. Had fetched  Kenny & Kat  from Tampines, parked @ T2 (  cost me $7/- for carpark! bah!  ), went to BK to eat, saw the new volunteers, was joined later by  Angeline, Shannen  & the West Gang. Went to departures after that, saw more people there;( from cadets, to officers to family members & other HQ ppl ) Was such a sight. Ended up becoming the photographer for the day again. (  nv see the second pic; bottom one ) Was the only instructor not in the pic..haiz... nvm.  Well, I hope Law & Angeline & the cadets enjoy themselves and know more abt Kimchi! hahah no la. hee ..just joking.  Can't imagine already 3+am in the morning and i'm still in front of the comp.  can't sleep ar..again.  Anyways, sum up last 3 days stuff.  1. NDP on Sat was much better than the NE Show. SAF apologize to the students. food was better. Dorl popped down to see coningent. More pictures taken. Preview tickets passed to the cadets. (  left less than 2 more weeks )  2. Sun dinner at Marsiling. Met up  Han Wen  from my old camp for a fellowship gathering @ one of the camp's DXOs' home. Was great to see so many familiar faces after such a long time. Shared songs & prayed for each others' burdens.   3. Yesterday, settled NDP matters at HQ thou Shannen was not there, did some work too. Had Camp meeting in the evening. (  Dec 1- 13, 3 camps that i may be involved in but can't confirm yet as sch schedule not out yet )  hmm.. think that was all.  Future: tmr going to Hq to settle on the tickets issue. maybe see mood first then decide if I wanna go clear RCY room again.

Yummy tall glasses of pure chocolate indulgence. Over there, Saw Serence & Liying, our RC juniors with some friends too. Isn't it a small world? Serene was celebrating her birthday...

Just finished checking my emails &amp; currently doing some testimonials for friends in Friendster.     &nbsp;  today was a pretty simple day. Had lunch @  miramar hotel  with my grandparents &amp; cousin. had a dim sum buffet, was quite alright i guess. for $11++ for all you can eat.&nbsp; Headed to HQ after that to do the Red Cross Rm. bought some paper &amp; stickers to do up the cupboards. hmmm.... the place looks s o much neater now. think got to account for the stuff after the sorting of items.&nbsp; got home &amp; saw a letter @ MDIS, application for course approved. I'll be schooling from sept onwards! hurray!    &nbsp;  tommorrow will be going back to  Chai Chee Sec  to assist my sister in one of her projects. Project EYe. an enrichment project for NA/NT students on photography but also teaching them abt responsibilities, value of learning , etc... pretty meaningful.     &nbsp;  okays, shld be logging off soon. i need to do things in the morning.

       feet are still sore&nbsp;today. No thanks for Sat's NE SHOw. I beileve lots of angry parents must be cursing &amp; swearing @ us or @ SAF. and I dun blame them. This was totally ridiculous.&nbsp; leaving SIS @ midnight? luckily we got  Law, Mr Ang, Wilson Sir  (  thanks sir, appreciated ) &amp; myself dropping those cadets back to their door steps, if not how? Also wanna thank  Dor maam , Hui min  &amp; the other instructors who had helped to coax the worried parents outside HQ before we arrived.    &nbsp;  still irritated by the whole thing esp. how SAF NDP Exco worked things out.&nbsp; okays, trying to be professional here... luckily we had a few pre-warnings by past OICs &amp; senior officers beforehand. But this totally caught all of us by the blind side.     &nbsp;  And now because of Sat's incident, I got one "  casualty of war " on my list. One angry parent has withdrawn his daughter from the contingent. And i beileve this might not be the end. But i'm praying that it is. We can't afford to have these situations hinder our performances &amp; morale.   The contingnent did a respective performance and i'm proud of that . They have improved so much since the first time i was them @ unity Sec in Mar.    &nbsp;  getting late.....betta rest well before i get my biological clock mixed up again.

      hmm... today i had quite a fruitful day. Morning, i actually for the first time in 5 days that i was up by 7am... Hurray! because i had a follow up session @ CGH due to my fracture toe in May. can you imagine I was done in 5 mins after 1 1/2 hr of waiting... argh!!! and it cost like $30+....so expensive man....  &nbsp;  after that, since i was still early, I decided to go down tampines to catch " King Arthur ". Was pretty alright to me....maybe kinda slow at times and some scences kinda out of place. But    Kiera   Knightley    is such a babe (  she has that X faxtor tt charms all )....and to think this young lady has done so many highprofile roles:  Star Wars 1, Bend it like Beckham, Pirates of the Carribeans  and now this... and she's only 19.... quite a highflyer.  &nbsp;  Then I went to meet  Law  and  Kat  @ PS.&nbsp; Anyways, we watched  Brotherhood  , a Korean war story. Full of emotions, and protrays the war sufferings of the main character as he was when the war started and after 50 yrs later. it shows the true meaning of Love, sacrifice, family bonding and the harsh reality of war. definately the better of the 2 movies today.  &nbsp;  And esp after seeing Brotherhood, it make me even more patriotic and NDP2004 gives me now a more personal feeling. We got to be prepared in a case of sudden disasters. Prevention is always better than cure and I 'll always willing to lay down my life for the safety of our homeland. This is Singapore we are talking abt, our Nation, our family &amp; friends,   OUR HOME!! !!!   &nbsp;  Today is already NE SHOw... left not much time to the actual day and i'm kinda nervous. (  Dear Lord, I pray to you that today's show will be a hit with the 100K+ pri sch kids and that our cadets do not show their fear or breakdown in the event . I also pray to you that there shldn't be any casualties and all of them, cadets &amp; instructors will make our nation proud, Ahem! !)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

              the picture (top) was taken by Kenny at the Nat'l Stadium during the last NDP rehearsal. kinda brought back sweet memories from last yr's parade. I had a picture abt the same angle just like Kenny's (below). Dun know why i really feel so patriotic recently, maybe it's because of all the rehearsals and the fact that the actual day is only abt 4 weeks away?can't blame for tt. I even went to see the vcd that our old Enciks from last yr gave us. remembering things like the SARS period to the great performances by the Parade and Show segments.  I beileve this year will be even greater!

      hahah... me still cannot sleep so i editting some things on my blog. Feeling kinda Patriotic so i went to put this year's NDP song - Home. Sung by JJ Lin Jun Jie ( by hip hop and kinda addictive after a while)... heehee..and for those who dun know the lyrics, here u go.  Home:  Whenever I am feeling low I look around me and I know There's a place that will stay within me Wherever I may choose to go I will always recall the city Know every street and shore Sail down the river which brings us life Winding through my Singapore   Chorus: This is home truly, where I know I must be  Where my dreams wait for me, where that river always flows This is home surely, as my senses tell me  This is where I won't be alone, for this is where I know it's home   When there are troubles to go through We'll find a way to start anew There is comfort in the knowledge That home's about its people too  So we'll build our dreams together Just like we've done before  Just like the river which brings us life There'll always be Singapore  (Chorus X 2)  For this is where I know it's home For this is where I know I'm home

      The weekend is minutes away from been over again. well, I think i had a pretty eventful last 2 days. So good tt this might be a long blog, depending on my mood.   Let me start with yesterday's NDP training. actually wanted to have breakfast with the rest of the juniors but i decided to drive my sister to work first. by the time i reached HQ, it was like 11+. and it was raining... so got wet a bit. but who knew it turned out to be a shower of blessing. The cadets did put on a great show for their parents thou still with a few hiccups ( luckily not tt obvious , had no casualty too, 1st time ,man). Next week will be worse , a stadium full of noisy pri sch kids... hahahha. fianlly, managed to see the actual parade from the grand stand area, and what a view! Dun miss this yr's parade.   dinner was also like " worth the wait & sweat" . They Had 62353535. Pizza , drumlets and garlic bread. Not to forgot the Ice cream as well. so great seeing the whole contingnent enjoying themselves. They are beginning to motivate each other without the instructors needing to push them.  But i think the moment for the day was while we were heading back. One of the juniors, whom shall not be named to protect his pride , while trying to bend down to pack some things for me had something unthinkable happen to him. He actuallly ripped his RC pants and it was a big one. luckily he reacted quickly enough. In the end , we had to send him back to HQ in the ambulance. Basically tt was it for yesterday.  Today, i rose late. and found out tt my dear old "daddy-O " was under the weather & i had to take his place with my mum for 2 evening activities. firstly, we went to Victoria Concert Hall where her school band was performing. And i was impressed by their talents esp the saxophone player.It's no mean feat to do a solo in front of so many people. I also enjoyed the percussion group, always wanted to try learning the drums... so i took note of their band's drummer. ( i'm not buaya-ing la..duh! mi enjoy these type of concerts you know)  After tt, I accompanied my mother for one of my RC senior's daugther's wedding. Saw a lot of senior ranking officers, past and present , at the hotel. And they all started abt the good old times and also what's the recent happenings over at RC & their own lives. Being the youngest amongst the whole table, I was dubbed as " Young Man" who had to finish up all the remaining food. And to think, i actually heard tt my face came up on TV because they were covering the area opp Centrepoint for the news and so happened tt I just in front of them ( and i didn't know tt they were really filiming)   okays, start of another "work" week. Thou i'm unempolyed, I'm still much tied up with other stuff. I need a break!

      Actually took this off from a friend's blog... becoz i really felt it close to my heart..Pls read it, it's so meaningful. ( xiao gua , i hope u dun mind)    A story tells that two friends were walking  through the desert. During some point of the journey they had an argument, and one friend slapped the other one in the face.  The one who got slapped was hurt,  but without saying anything, wrote in the sand:   "TODAY MY BEST FRIEND  SLAPPED ME IN THE FACE."   They kept on walking until they found an oasis,  where they decided to take a bath. The one who  had been slapped got stuck in the mire and  started drowning, but the friend saved him.  After he recovered from the near drowning, he wrote on a stone:   "TODAY MY BEST FRIEND SAVED MY LIFE. "   The friend who had slapped and  saved his best friend asked him,  "After I hurt you, you wrote in the  sand and now, you write on a stone, why?" The other friend replied "When someone  hurts us we should write it down in sand where winds  of forgiveness can erase it away. But, when someone does something good for us, we must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it."  LEARN TO WRITE YOUR HURTS IN THE SAND  AND T O CARVE YOUR BENEFITS IN STONE.    They say it takes a minute to find a special person,  an hour to appreciate them,  a day to love them,  but then an entire life to forget them.   Do not value the THINGS you have in your life..  But value WHO you have in your life!

      hmm.... was going thru a few friends' blogs and some of them had music on them... so i decided to copycat a bit and added one to my blogger as well.( hee... yea, no originiality, but i dun care)  Was thinking of what song to put in. wanted something to go wif my theme : " Journeys".... and then it just hit me like  *POW!*  i liked songs from a group called  Journey  esp 2 of their greatest hits; Open Arms & Faithfully. chose the latter because it expresses what i wanted to say. to be faithful in doing the things I love and to the people whom i treasure.   tommorrow i'm following my sister to Chai Chee Sec to teach the cadets how to " play " with Photoshop and the point-and-shoot camera. first time i'm actually doing these type of stuff. maybe because i'm so free now after i finish. Can you imagine that I'm already 10 days free from NS. ;)  after that, i'll be having an another meeting at my Red Cross HQ. preparing for some japanese delegates who are coming over next month.okays, getting late liao, mi betta stop here...

      got back home from town just now. Visited TMC and MDIS branches in the early afternoon with my mum to gather some information on the courses that i might want to enrol in. It's the top priority now in my mind... other things can wait.   yesterday's NDP training was alright i guess. The cadets have shown much improvement since the last week. Arm swings looking much better.thou like i said before, more room for improvements still. Wet weather actually caused much disruptions for the trainings at first.Luckily, we got there just as it downpoured. Esp things like moving from the SIS to the Nat'l Stadium were in a mess. But also good thing that it rained, the casualty rate dropped a lot.Praise the Lord. The cadets were really excitied and their morale were pretty high. maybe it's because they had western dinner by SFI and lotsa of ice cream. the instructors too were enjoying themselves, enjoying the full run from the galleries.  Hiccups occurred in the training but no fingerpointing were to be involved . All of us are always learning new things,even me. How to control the cadets, how to guide the new volunteers and even how to manage such a big event. it's thru mistakes we learn where we went wrong and how we can solve them. Really grateful that i also got Mr Ang and Law with me by my side, hinting me on some areas of concern.   val coming back to SIN tomorrow evening, so i got 1 more person to tussle for the net and car soon. hahahah... guess now it's time for me to be the chauffuer.

      found this via a friend.... felt pretty true.. what abt you?  People come into your life for a reason, a season or a lifetime. When you figure out which one it is, you will know what to do for each person.  When someone is in your life for a  REASON . . . It is usually to meet a need you have expressed. They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally, or spiritually. They may seem like a godsend, and they are! They are there for the reason you need them to be. Then, without any wrongdoing on your part, or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end. Sometimes they die. Sometimes they walk away. Sometimes they act up and force you to take a stand. What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled, their work is done. The prayer you sent up has been answered. And now it is time to move on.  Then people come into your life for a  SEASON . Because your turn has come to share, grow, or learn. They bring you an experience of peace, or make you laugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it! It is real! But, only for a season.   LIFETIME  relationships teach you lifetime lessons: things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person, and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your life. It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant.

       haven't got time to blog for the last few days becuase i was busy recuperating from a bad case of the fever & diaherria(  always cannot get the spelling right ) .... went to the loo like every 2 hours... feeling much much better today.  wonder how is " xiao zhu " doing...hahaa... she's also down to some bug.  thou sick, went down to HQ yest. to settle the iwate home stay thingy. Had the briefing to the cadets as well as our own comm mtg. can't imagine tt they are actually turning up this Sat evening. so fast & got so many things yet to be confirmed. (  praying so hard for this visit to be a success.. think  Dorl  can agree on that part ) can see from yest. that She &amp;  Angeline  were stressed abt lots of admin stuff. (  must really thank Angi for all her help )  I'm kinda excitied too because once this project & NDP is over, the only time i need to worry for projects will be in Dec. Hurray! can concentrate on my studies finally..as you can see on my countdowns.   Countdowns:  1. to Iwate delegates coming to SG  :    less than 72 hrs. 2. to NDP                                             :    4 days left 3. to studies                                         :    1 more month.

            were you one of the hundreds of people crowded around Marina Square, Esplanade or Fullerton area this evening to see the fireworks? well, I was one of them, together with  Siyun, Chee Yong & Edmund . think this might be the only time for me to see fireworks this year.   As part of the celebrations to NDP, tonight's event was the first of 3 weekend shows. Carpark was a headache. Stuck in the jam for so long... duh.. managed to park @ old parliament building. hee. The show thou lasted only a few minutes, was worth the wait. Even the drizzle didn't seem to dampened the public who who waiting there for God knows what time. Some brought umbrellas, ponchos but many were still enjoying themselves. Having pinics & taking pictures like me.   This was truly an  EnLIGHTened  moment for me.
