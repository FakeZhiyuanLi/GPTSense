        No one reads this but that's okay. This is good for me. Like therapy... It helps to vent. Today I woke up at 7 to work with daddy. Ashlie and I worked like... something that works really really hard! (I don't know I am to tired to think!) But yea, the cat house is so HUGE! We still aren't finished with it! We'll finish it tomorrow.  Last night I realized that I had been lied to. And if you know me you know I absolutely HATE being lied too. I have been played. I thought I was smart enough not to be, but as it turns out some players are REALLY good with concealing their motives. But I’m still not upset or mad… I’m just frustrated. I could have been persuing the guy I truly liked instead of wasting my time with a player. But I have a plan… Its going to shock the hell out of this guy! I’m tired of chickening out when I think about doing it. I know I need to do it the next time I see him before it’s too late.   Hmm… I think that is it for today.  Cat

         I have absolutely no idea what I am doing on this but maybe I can get the hang of it. I have a xanga site but this seems much more interesting. Well let's see... I've been helping my Grammy at her job. She teaches second grade in Altha. My cousin Nathan and I mostly just did filing for her. He got finished before me because I had more papers than he did so he helped my Grammy lift heavy boxes. I had a little chat today with someone to clear things up. Which is good... I guess.    Anyways... tomorrow and Friday, I have to help my dad at his work. He builds houses for a living and I am going to be cleaning a house he's trying to finish. It's by far the coolest house ever. The woman he is building it for has 28 cats. Her house has all these cool passages and rooms for her cats. I want a house just like it when I become a cat lady... You are probably thinking... "What in the hell is a cat lady?" Well whether you want to know or not I'll tell you. A cat lady is a old woman who lives all alone with her many cats. No husband... just her cats. No one knows what she looks like. She has the people at the grocery store bring her milk, bread, and catnip so no one in town can see her or make fun of her. All the kids in the town are scared of her and avoid walking by her house. They tell scary stories about her and her cats and dare each other to go knock on the door to catch a peek at the.... duh duh duhhhh... Cat Lady. Why am I going to be a cat lady? Well as I have just proved again I can't make it longer than a week with a guy. It's a curse! Something always happens for them to break-up with me or for me to break-up with them. Most of the time it's an ex-girlfriend... It wasn't this past time... well, I don't really even know why this past time it ended. I know I wanted it... I just couldn't bring myself to do it. So I was relieved when I was being dumped... which is weird but then again I can be weird at times... Oh well.    So yeah, before I got myself off topic I was talking about working for my dad for 2 days. It will be cool because I will get paid minimum wage. I'll be able to have some extra spending money for when I go to Destin this weekend. My best guy friend Blake and I are going to go to our store... Hollister. Okay, I'm getting side-tracked again but my family owns a lake house on a lake not to far away from Destin. It's nothing special... It's just a double wide trailor, but its something. We are going to hitch his bad-out jet ski to my mom's car and try not to kill ourselves when we ride it. It's going to be a busy couple of days.    Well I guess that's enough for today. I need to quit rambling.    Cat
