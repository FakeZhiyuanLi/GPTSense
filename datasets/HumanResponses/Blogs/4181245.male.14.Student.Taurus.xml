      Yesterday, my school celebrated ndp. It was very busy and nervous. There are too many things happening and I just cant get away with it. One of them is the national day parade. At this point of time, I am very nervous. Not because this is my first parade, but this tie-in the i/c of the flag party. The flag party have to march to the flag pole carrying the Singapore flag. Basicly, I am very nervous, as I have to shout some commands. When the parade commander shout "kumpulan bendera..masuk baris"believe it or not, I was shivering. After that, I quickly shouted and command the flag party.Many people said it was quite hillarious..Well, it goes like this.."Kumpulan bendera...sedi.... ar!!!" then,"kumpulan bendera, dari kanan...cepat ja.....lan!!!"Thank god there was no mistake..then when im marching, i really look up...hahahax....My step down sarjen and my USM is really proud of me...Many people said to me...soo what becoming the flag party..but cumon...im so honoured to represent NCC and im only sec 2.My rank is still LCP.All the members of the flag party have done a wonderful job....Thks guys..Ok..That is the parade..NOw..MY national song singing or should i say the dancing competition...AR!!. ..im still uncertain with my dance steps...At the first place, iwas lazy to dance..my fren point a kinife at my neck forcing me to dance.I have no other choice...HaHax...We had our last minute practice...without the music..blahblahbla h...When i saw the other class dancing, i gave up..they dance so well that even myself cant even have their stardard...But my teacher gave as support and we give our best shot..When its our class turn. i was shivering again.hahaha...Well it went all well...i love shaking my butt ...shaking it2..my partner,suzie was very funny...during that time also can talk with me...haiya...nv m..coz her dancing was quite great too tou know...After the dance, we waited for the results..we have expected that we will lose..in the end...we got 2nd...i think so.hahahax..Hai z...i was verry happy..After that..i quickly rush home...have a nice nap..sleep3...i forgotten my Firday prayers...h aha..luckily i was enough time for me to rush to the mosque...Wow..what a wonderful life i have in school...hah ahax..hope i will cherish my life in school...HAPPY BIRTHDAY SINGAPORE!!!!
