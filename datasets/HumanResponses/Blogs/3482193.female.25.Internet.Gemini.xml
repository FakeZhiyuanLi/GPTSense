      Got this from one of my friends and ex colleague Ravi. I think its a compliment for women.   A little boy asked his mother, "Why are you crying?" "Because I'm a woman", she told him. "I don't understand," he said. His mom just hugged him and said, "And you never will".  Later the little boy asked his father, "Why does mother seem to cry for no reason?" "All women cry for no reason" was all his dad could say.   The little boy grew up and became a man, still wondering why women cry. Finally He put in a call to GOD; when GOD got on the phone, the man asked, "GOD, why do women cry so easily?" GOD said, "When I made woman she had to be special. I made her shoulders strong enough to carry the weight of the world; yet gentle enough to give comfort.  I gave her an inner strength to endure  child birth and the rejection that many times comes from her children.  I gave her a hardness that allows her to keep going when everyone else gives up and take care of her family through sickness and fatigue without complaining.  I gave her sensitivity to love her children under any and all circumstances, even when her child has hurt her badly. This same sensitivity helps her make a child's boo-boo feel better and share in her teenagers anxieties and fears.  I gave her strength to carry her husband through his faults and fashioned her from his rib to protect his heart.  I gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never hurts his wife, but sometimes test her strengths and her resolve to stand beside him unfalteringly.  And finally, I gave her a tear to shed. This is hers exclusively to use whenever it is needed."    "THE BEAUTY OF A WOMAN IS NOT IN HER CLOTHES SHE WEARS, THE FIGURE THAT SHE CARRIES, OR THE WAY SHE COMBS HER HAIR. THE BEAUTY OF A MUST BE SEEN IN HER EYES, BECAUSE THAT IS THE DOORWAY TO HER HEART, THE PLACE WHERE LOVE RESIDES"

      got the idea from hirdu's blog of posting certain good forwarded mails. but i shud mention this is not a forwarded mail but a file sent to me by my friend in certain discussion. thnx gautam.  inspite of the fact that i dont believe in GOD i found it interesting. i liked the intelliegence and smartness by which the student proved his point. i believe this happened coz he believed in what he said and was confident on it. here it starts  An atheist professor of philosophy speaks to his class on, "The problem science has with Krishna". He asks one of his new students to stand and.....   Professor: You are a Hare Krishna devotee, aren't you, son?   Student: Yes, sir.   Prof: So you believe in God?   Student: Absolutely, sir.   Prof: Is God good?   Student: Sure.   Prof: Is God all-powerful?   Student: Yes.   Prof: My brother died of cancer even though he prayed to Krishna to heal him. Most of us would attempt to help others who are ill. But Krishna didn't. How is this Krishna good then? Hmm?   (The student is silent.)   Prof: You can't answer, can you? Let's start again, young fellow. Is God good?   Student: Yes.   Prof: Is Satan good?   Student: No.   Prof: Where does Satan come from?   Student: From...God...   Prof: That's right. Tell me son, is there evil in this world?   Student: Yes.   Prof: Evil is everywhere, isn't it? And God did make everything. Correct?   Student: Yes.   Prof: So who created evil?   (The student does not answer.)   Prof: Is there sickness? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness? All these terrible things exist in the world, don't they?   Student: Yes, sir.   Prof: So, who created them?   (The student has no answer.)   Prof: Tell me, son. Do you believe in Krishna?             Student: Yes, professor, I do.   Prof: Science says you have 5 senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. Have you ever seen Krishna   Student: No, sir.   Prof: Tell us if you have ever heard your Krishna?   Student: No, sir.   Prof: Have you ever felt your Krishna, tasted your Krishna, smelt your Krishna? Have you ever had any sensory perception of Krishna or God for that matter?   Student: No, sir. I'm afraid I haven't.   Prof: Yet you still believe in Him?                                 Student: Yes.   Prof: According to empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol, science says your Krishna doesn't exist.  What do you say to that, son?   Student: Nothing. I only have my faith.   Prof: Yes, Faith. And that is the problem science has.  Student: Professor, is there such a thing as heat?   Prof: Yes.   Student: And is there such a thing as cold?   Prof: Yes.   Student: No sir. There isn't.   (The lecture theatre becomes very quiet with this turn of events.)   Student: Sir, you can have lots of heat, even more heat, superheat, mega heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat. But we don't have anything called Cold. We can hit 458 degrees below zero, which is no heat, but we can't go any further after that. There is no such thing as cold. Cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot measure cold. Heat is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it.   (There is pin-drop silence in the lecture theatre.)   Student: What about darkness, professor? Is there such a thing as Darkness?   Prof: Yes. What is night if there isn't darkness?   Student: You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is the absence of something. You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing light.....But if you have no light constantly, you have nothing and it's called darkness, isn't it? In reality, darkness isn't. If it were you would be able to make darkness darker, wouldn't you?             Prof: So what is the point you are making, young man?   Student: Sir, my point is your philosophical premise is flawed.   Prof: Flawed? Can you explain how?   Student: Sir, you are working on the premise of duality. You argue there is Life and then there is Death, a good God and a bad God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite, something we can measure.    Sir, science can't even explain a thought. It uses electricity and Magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully understood either one. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing. Death is not the opposite of life: just the absence of it.  Now tell me, professor. Do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey?   Prof: If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, yes, of course, I do.   Student: Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?  (The Professor shakes his head with a smile, beginning to realize where the argument is going.)   Student: Since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor, are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you not a scientist but a preacher?   (The class is in uproar.)   Student: Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professor's brain?  (The class breaks out into laughter)   Student: Is there anyone here who has ever heard the professor's brain, felt it, touched or smelt it? No one appears to have done so. So, according to the established rules of empirical, stable, demonstrable protocol, science says that you have no brain, sir.  With all due respect, sir, how do we then trust your lectures, sir?   (The room is silent. The professor stares at the student, his face Unfathomable.)   Prof: I guess you'll have to take them on faith, son.   Student: That is it sir. The link between man & GOD is FAITH. That is all that keeps things moving & alive.

      Well I wrote something else but due to some reasons I m forced to change that. But yes a part of my previous posting will remain the same. I was very disturbed yest i.e. fri. and tried to contact my friends.  In fact I did not even try to contact Anamika. It was just that she cud feel that I was very upset and disturbed on fri eve and called me from London. Yes u read London. That’s a long distance call. From London to India. She talked with me for 10 min. it wud have costed her a lot. And she wrote me long mails just to make me feel better. She has always tried to do anything and everything that she can from London just to make me feel better. She has always been with me in recent times. Its just a month or may be more that I know her. But still I feel she is my real friend who never tried to avoid me when I really needed her.

      there was a plan of me flying to New York but was not decided yet. my cousin is getting married there. she is not only my cousin but my dearest friend too. long time since i have seen her as she is busy with her job and never gets time to come to India. but she is the best. the best person. very good natured etc etc...i admire her the most and after all she is the only sis younger to me. me going on her marriage in nov. but a moment b4 i was surprised to hear that mom was telling my sis "ponu (that's my pet name) to shweta (my cousin cum friend) ki shaadi par ja rahi hai, tu bhi chali ja...mauka achha hai.. papa bhejne ko taiyar hain abhi" this is the way we talk. i was surprised to hear this. as they were reluctant in sending me till date. i think i was crying a lot yest...they did not ask me the reason...neither they tried to console me as they new i will cry more but i think they knew the reason and have decided immediately to divert my attention. i think  PARENTS R JUST GR8888888888 . no one can be like them

      i have given the title "Good and bad experiences to my blog". i think its wrong. dont have any good experiences to share right now. only bad experiences. me going thru a very bad phase of my life when nothing good is happening. i have to change the way i look life. i have become a very negative thinker.  for example in my last to last posting i mentioned abt that girl from HCL tech (i think i start thinking negatively knoning that someone is from HCL Tech). i said all negative abt her. that is not the fact. i think coz i have become a negative thinker i cud c all negative in her. the infosys test was in a school. i cud not c how well she cud relate herself with that school. she cud rem all her school times looking at the school. wasnt that sweet of her. i cud not think that ways. even waiting for the results i cud only think abt me.. abt how do i get a job etc etc...but she was enjoying the school, the green grass of the lawn etc etc... me going thru a very bad phase of my life. dont know when will this phase end. i dont have a job. thats another issue. plus i m very upset thinking abt only one person the whole day long. if i wud have been working at the moment then that wud have def helped me a lot. i know this phase will also end soon. GOD help me to come out of it

      Just saw the movie “Saaya”. It is amazing. Just amazing. The movie shows the depth in their love. But I was wondering does this really happen in real life. No no I don’t mean the issues of life after death. I mean does such true love exist in real life too. I doubt it. It does not. It’s only meant to be shown in movies. As anamika once wrote in her blog. “Movie makers sell dreams”. Similarly anything shown in movies is generally a fiction. Nothing more than that. In real life ppl strive to achieve more and get success…unlimited success. They r mean. Just how to progress in life, career etc etc…. And when they r doing good what they want is someone for the timepass to relieve them from their tensions. Who unknowingly in her or his innocence entertains one. Nothing more than that. So no such term “True love” exists in life

      1. First of all, pick the number of times a week that you would like to  have dinner out. (try for more than once but less than 10).    2. Multiply this number by 2 (Just to be bold)    3. Add 5. (Just because)    4. Multiply it by 50 - dont tell me u need a calculator    5. If you have already had your birthday this year add 1754.... If you haven't, add 1753.......    6. Now subtract the four digit year that you were born.        You should have a three digit number.                 The first digit of this was your original number (How many times  you want to eat out each week.)         The next two numbers are... YOUR AGE! (Oh YES, it IS!!!!!)    can anyone tell me how this works?? have seen similar in past times but cud never understand how they work

      today met someone and forced to think on something. today went for the infosys test. and the same what was expected. but saw oner thing that the questions were the simlar as they were in previous papers. if u r able tosolve their previous papaers somew\how, if some guides then yes def infosys test is cleared after the test met 2 girls. one was from sirsa and one from noida. the noida girl is working in HCL tech noida. as she was talking abt her she cud only tell her successes and cud  ONLY PRAISE HER . i dont know. she said she cleared the infosys test last to last year also. she said she cleared these many rounds there and those many rounds there. she has always been praised by most of the ppl. her friends say u have been good at the class during engg. etc etc....i was astonished to c that what she cud tell abt herself was only successes. is it that now she is in HCL noida she is successful. this does not mean that she never faced any failure??? she was clever enough to avoid giving me the HR's id even. well no probs. i was also doing the  TIMEPASS  as i needed a company till results were displayed. hahahahahah.....

      i m restless today. was restless the whole day long. feeling helpless. why is this happening with me. i was so happy recently. why does this happen. when we grow up we r in a position to identify with all the probs n tensions and in a way have to solve them ourselves. isnt it possible that we remain kids. innocent kids. who dont anything abt this cruel world. who r so immature and ignorant. i want to remain like them. but thats also not possible. coz after all as i have grown up. i cant igonre all probs. why cant i ignore them. why cant i become a small kid 5 yrs old who used to spoil all my mom's lipsticks by putting them one by one in the noon when she wud be sleeping. and wud get a scolding afterwards. then as usual i wud cry and mummy wud love me and make me understand that i shud not do that. why cant i remain the same 5 yr old kid who used to roam around in my lane in shorts and wud play with the kids of my age all eve. those school days were golden days. at that time we used to think this home work is bad. these exams r bad. grown up ppl dont need to give any exams. the fact is we have to face an exam everyday. there is nothing good happening now. i m fed up. dont know what life has in store for me. right now what i can c is only darkness. only disappointments. dont know when will this phase end. if this phase does not end then life shud end

      Practice makes perfect.....  But nobody's perfect......  so why practice?   I was born intelligent -  education ruined me.   If it's true that we are here to help others,  then what exactly are the others here for?   Since light travels faster than sound,  people appear bright until you hear them speak.   How come "abbreviated" is such a long word?   Money is not everything.  There's Mastercard & Visa.   One should love animals.  They are so tasty.   Behind every successful man, there is a woman  And behind every unsuccessful man, there are two.   Every man should marry.  After all, happiness is not the only thing in  life.   The wise never marry.  and when they marry they become otherwise.   Success is a relative term.  It brings so many relatives.   Never put off the work till tomorrow  what you can put off today.   "Your future depends on your dreams"  So go to sleep   There should be a better way to start a day  Than waking up every morning   "Hard work never killed anybody"  But why take the risk   "Work fascinates me"  I can look at it for hours   God made relatives;  Thank God we can choose our friends.   The more you learn, the more you know,  The more you know, the more you forget  The more you forget, the less you know  So.. why learn.   A bus station is where a bus stops.  A train station is where a train stops.  On my desk, I have a work station....  what more can I say........   If your father is a poor man,  it is your fate but,  if your father-in-law is a poor man,  it's your stupidity
