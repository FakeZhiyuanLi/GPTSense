      My entries in this thing seem much longer than I had expected them to be. I guess I'm better at free-writing than I thought. I'm talented at rambling on and on about one subject, so I guess that helped.  Well, I bought 3 more Mirrodin booster packs today, and I got a Broodstar-wasn't that fun. I guess I'm at a slight loss for words today, most likely because I used up all of my thoughts on last night's entry, there was no Spanish today for random funnies, and because I've covered most of everything I usually talk about. I don't really have any homework tonight to procrastinate from doing, so that's fun.  I've run out of things to say for now, and I don't feel like writing anyhow.

      This will be another boring episode of Bren's Random Rambling. I'm your host, Brendan Murphy.  My Mirrodin booster box finally came today. It sure took quite a while-nearly 4 weeks.  Recap of the day: Math-bleh Science-the movie was boring, but I got a chance to toil an get frustrated over my math homework Random Spanish funnies of the day:  1. Only seconds after I throw a small dictionary, frisbee-style, at Derrick's head and it glances off and falls to the floor, does Mrs. Sustic walk in and catch me with 5 dictionaries in my hand. 2. For the second have of the class, I periodically moved my desk to the left so much that I ended up in the next row over. Mrs. Sustic didn't notice at all. 3. Nathaniel whacks Derrick with elongated binding from planner notebook. Repeatedly.  Arg-I still have math homework that I really don't feel like doing, and don't really understand much at all. Anyone else know trig and the laws of Sines and Cosines? Anyone?? lol  I don't know if its the season or what, but lately my mind has gotten a bit more clouded with random thoughts, images, and junk. So just a notice-if you ever see me just randomly shudder periodically, I'm trying to get rid of it all so I can think and do homework. It's similar to when you've got music constantly playing in your head, and you can't get it out no matter how hard you try-not fun at all. It's getting annoying-quite.  Continuing the recap of the day: English-We're on chapter 9 of To Kill A Mockingbird, and I'm really enjoying the book. It's one of the best books I've read in English class so far, I'd say. Social-I got a 46/47 on the current events test, all because I said Alabama instead of Louisiana. What's the difference, anyway? They're both chock-full of rednecks, so I don't see why we shouldn't just call the whole South "Redneckville". lol Jazz band was fairly good today, other than Mr. Shelton saying we had a bad second set the other night. But he was right-we weren't that great for the second half of the performance at the open house.  This has been another boring episode of Bren's Random Rambling.  Thank you for listening.

      *Goes into mesmeric trance* Wow, was this weekend ever as tiring as hell. My team placed 4th at state for the robotics competition, and thank you all who came and supported us. MSA had three teams there, and considering we're a small school, thats quite a feat. And by the way, I got up at 6 on Saturday. I got home at 8, majorly exhausted. I didn't have enough energy to stomach the vegetable dish my dad made, so I had good ol' pizza...again. What a day, and damn it was fun. Hehe  Then Sunday, I was late to the Darksteel Pre-release, causing me to wait 4 hours until the next tournament started. It wasn't so bad, since I wasn't the only one late. I got up at 8 Sunday, and I got home around 7. Luckily I had no homework. Well...there was that science I didn't do...  Then of course, the wakeup call the next morning coming in the form of an obnoxious, ear-splitting beep. Jazz band was canceled today due to the weather, which was a nice benefit of all this snow. I've got a bit of homework tonight, so that helped. Also, I won't be going to my drum lesson tonight, yet another plus. I want to take someone to the Ice Palace this weekend too...hmmm....  That bastard still hasn't gotten the shipment of Mirrodin boxes, which does contain mine, in yet. It's getting me really pissed too-I ordered it on the 29th of December! *sue for mail fraud...*  Well, I'm off to actually get my homework done, and listen to music of course.  See ya'll lata, Bren

      Hey all. This one's going to be rather short and stubbish, as it is 9:06 and I'm obligated, or required, to splash cold water on my face at 6 in the morning tommorow and GET UP. Oh what fun. Just to let people know, the Lego Robotics State Competition, which is where I will be spending my time and becoming exhausted all day, is located at Benildi Saint Margaret's private school in St. Louis Park. It runs from 8 in the morning to about 5 in the afternoon. I will have the wonderful opportunity of getting over there by 7:30.  If any of you want to come, just show up. My team's name is Mars or Bust, and we're expecting to go to Nationals (LOL). Not really, but hey.  Dang, I wish I didn't have to get up so early. But I do, so I'm outta here since I'm tired and, of course, everyone knows that sleep is the solution to that. *Studies show that people who get 8 hours of sleep are more creative in the morning than those who don't.*  L8er all, Bren

      Hehe...missed a few days again. Oops. I shouldn't do that. I need to make a habit out of blogging a little bit each day. anyhow, this week has been a b$^&#-literally. Even though there's no damn finals, there was that English project. Boy was I glad to get that pile of crap, er, creative crap out of my hands in English today. What a relief.  Well, since I missed yesterday, here's the belated daily Spanish funny: As all of us guys in the corner prepare to drop our books on the floor simultaniously, Anton develops a habit of looking at the clock too much. Mrs. Sustic: "Anton, why are you looking at the clock so much?" Anton: "Uhhh..." Derrick: "Because this is boring!" *Derrick gets his desk moved to hall location for remainder of period.* Just for background information's sake, Derrick has a habit of getting "punished", as in having to face the board or go in the hall when he says the class is boring.   In other news, I humbly recieved a perfect score on that Social test...haha to all who didn't! lol, j/k  Hey-I think that I might actually have a life this weekend. *oooh...ahhhh...* That is, if getting up at 6, going to a robotics tourney on Saturday, then going to a Darksteel prerelease for Magic on Sunday counts. I don't know.  As for the week being a bitch: 1. Had to move piano lesson from Tuesday to Wednesday due to amount of homework (cough...English). 2. Had Jazz Band and piano lesson on Wednesday, plus homework. 3. Had robotics practice on Thursday along with playing jazz band at the open house. I was fasionably late too-*drummer dashes in to the Great Hall, band immediately starts playing when he reaches the set* 4. Choir on Friday. Hopefully no homework for weekend, as it will be full. 5. Blah, blah, blah. So on, and so fourth.  Getting tired, as usually. So that means the end of this blog entry.  Later, Bren  "Cause’ it feels like summer again I was thinking that it just might never begin After winter and spring It’s good to have the sun on my face again"

      It seems as though I missed a few days here. Oh well. Its currently 12:30 AM, and I'm not supposed to be online...hehe. It seems as though the social test was easier than I thought. So that made me feel like I didn't really deserve the weekend. Wait a minute, do I ever deserve it? I mean, its not like I have a nightlife on the weekends. Saturday night: sitting at home watching SNL. Friday night: robotics. How interesting.  Well, the long weekend is here, and I still don't have anything really fun planned. Yay-and then there's that English project...which brings me to this:  Evil English project progress: completely done with the three newspaper articles. One out of seven parts, which leaves 6 do to.  As for that bio test-it required next to no studying, which was excedingly great. Social was different. *Last minute cram in study hall* Best moment of Friday: changing a random person's background on the computer to...uh...can't say. My idea too...good times.  Arg-its now 12:36, and I'm literally shivering because my room is so [censored] cold. Combine that with being tired, and having to get up at 9:00 AM, and its not fun. So I'm outta here.  Remember, *Sleep is good*  Bren

      Woohoo, the half point in the week has come and passed. Now its the dash to the weekend...only 2 more days... Blah,  I've got to bust through the biology test, and then the finish line of the Social test to reach that lap of luxury known as any day without school. Its 80 points too, oh joy. And I really sucked in the review today, which means I need to study-a lot, probably more than usual, which is close to none. So what exactly do I do in my non-studying time? I spend too much time online and I get caught by my mom...not fun. I have to figure out a way to evade her somehow, or else I'm never going to get my permit, let alone my license.  I'm most likely going skiing at Afton on Monday, so if I know you and you want to go, let me know. We need as many ppl as possible.  Back to that ol' bio test...its going to be 50 some points, and I'm not too great at Protein Synthesis and all that crap. That means more studying=yippee. Good thing for study halls and block days. Hehe, Mr. Shelton got mad at the wind ensemble today for not playing with enough "passion" and talking too much. Of course I had nothing to do with it...::shifty eyes:: It does pay to be back in that percussion section where you're out of the line of sight...hehe.  Random daily question: Who has ever heard of the band Tower of Power? If so, name 3 songs by them.  Daily Spanish funnies: Kevin Grey says, "Yo he sido un zanahoria." and Mrs. Sustic didn't catch it.  Mrs. Mooney's advisory won the challenge today, for once. Go us. I'm running out of ideas...um...my drumsticks are white/black striped...sort of. That means I'm tired, which merits the fact that I'm leaving soon, which eventually leads to the true equation sleep=good.  "I'm tired (too late to quit too soon to go home) I'm tired (too late to quit too soon to go home)"  Over and out, Bren

      Well, here I am again. I haven't done my chores I said I'd do last night, and I'm looking at another week of school including Mrs. Saum and her plan to curse us with the damned creative writing project. ::beaten down with proverbial writing project stick:: arg!!  Last night was dull contrary to what I was predicting, sort of. But hey-who knew? Damn I need to go skiing soon-I've been snow deprived since Winter Break, and its not fun when you have perfectly good skis sitting on the porch beckoning you to go to Afton Alps. Sounds tempting, huh? Yep.  I've got this strange feeling that this week is going to suck even more than the last, which is near impossible considering having to get up at 6:30 for the first time in a few weeks. I nearly forgot my locker combo too-fun. At least there isn't choir this week, and there's always Jazz Band (yay).  Now its 9:30, and I'm going to bed, without doing my chores.  I'm outta here, Brendan

      Yep, now even I have a blog. What is the world coming to? Hehe, well you're going to have to give me a break, since this is the first time I used blogger (yeah right...). I'm generally good at freewriting, so this shouldn't be too hard, I think. Whats good about this weekend: virtually no homework except for reading chapter 11 in A Separate Peace. The bad: the damned English project that Mrs. Saum (grrr) has brought upon us. So far so good though-I didn't have to burn my grade report before my parents got to it this time. There's too much creative writing in that damned project that I think that I might even fail (gasp). There's also too many dictionaries flying around in the Spanish room every day...lol. I really do wonder when Mrs. Sustic will start noticing that. Although, she did notice when half the room said "la vaca" instead of the right word on the tape. Still...  Well, now I get to go do my weekly chores (whoo hoo). The day may be dreary, but at least the night won't be dull.  Later, Brendan

      Hehe-2 posts in one day. f#@% it-the other one was from this morning. That party was great-a big thank you to Amanda for inviting me!!  Question: Who has seen Young Frankenstein? Great movie-absolute classic Mel Brooks comedy. Everyone should see it-just like everyone should read American Gods.  These days, everyone needs something to look forward to. Here's my list: 1. Talking to: Caitlin, Amelia, Amanda, Shayl, Liz 2. Summer (of course) 3. Biking 4. May Term 5. MITY 6. Getting done with this stupid English project  To everyone who's had a crappy week, or even a bad year, here's what I say: Just tell yourself to hold on just one more day, and keep doing that. Eventually, it'll be summer before you know it. Just keep saying it, and you'll get through it all.

      I can't help to think about spring and summer these days. I'm f@#%ing sick of winter. May term schedule and registration sheets were handed out yesterday, so that gives another thing to look forward to.  Why summer is so much better: long days it's not cold out anymore, so coats aren't needed NO SCHOOL!!!! *no homework too* MITY riding a bike-I can get to just about anywhere on two wheels *racing comes along with that* open windows on the house playing loud music with the windows open fresh air reading books outside *or in a tree...lol* lotsa parties riding in a convertible fishing, even though I never do... eating outside the satisfaction received from killing a goddamn mosquito MITY, again (session B this time) chillin' seeing old friends...  Well, there very well could be many more, but I don't want to take the time to type them all. That pretty much sums it all up. I used to like winter more than summer, and now I look back and say, "what the f@#%?" Oh, and I forgot the part of earning tons of money so I can actually buy stuff and pay off my debt to Best Buy. It doesn't look like I'll be getting any wedding jobs, so I'll just expand my monopoly on the business of lawn mowing in St. Paul Park. I need money so bad-I'm dead broke. Maybe I'll even get started on my movie this summer...on a really really low budget.  No quote this time, but maybe next.

      This country needs a regime change, or I'm leaving. Not that that would matter...  Every so often, I'll be posting a quote of mine in here, so here's another:  "Helping a friend out of depression isn't standing on the surface and tossing down a rope. It's falling into the hole with them and climbing out together."

      I finished reading American Gods today-a really compelling book. Now on to Stardust.  I went back to school today, and things didn't seem to change a whole lot. wierd  I seriously think I'm going to bomb this damned social test. I haven't even finished the worksheets. fuck  You know, each coming weekend it feels like I have less and less to look forward to. I wish winter would go in a damned corner and leave me alone. Spring needs to come soon dammit.  "I came into life expecting nothing. I walked away possessing everything I never dreamed I would have."

I needed a day off-not quite a mental health day, but you gotta replenish your sanity from time to time. I spent the day reading American Gods, by Neil Gaiman.  you should read it

      As usual, my weekends were as expected-uneventful and nearly a mirror copy of the previous weekend. It's pretty sad when you're weekends are as day-in, day-out similar as the normal school days are. I still have my cold, which has been with me for well over a week now. They really need to invent an instant-action rotitussin or something.  ReCaP: Friday: The lip-synch contest was quite interesting this time around. Much better than I had expected. As always, there were the cliched (my computer won't do accents...grrr) and overdone performances of stupid pop songs. Firstly, there was only one of these (thank god), but yes, there was a massive group of girls dancing to a sh$tty pop song. And they used POMPOMS!!!! AHHH! Needless to say, they weren't even close to being in the top 3.  Funniest performance: Matt Hermes performes "Internet Help desk", when the music suddenly changes to "I'm too sexy", and a few guys come in and start pushing him around and dancing. Matt Hermes didn't know that was going to happen, so he got pissed.  Best performances (in my opinion): 1. "Time Warp", from Rocky Horror Picture Show, done by Ian LaForge, Sheila Nezhad, Dan Mensen, and Leah Frichol. An encore performance was included at the end. 2. Andrew Kotz and Erik Gryska performed, and quite well actually, the classic rock song "Bohemian Rhapsody", by Queen. I was surprised that they didn't win anything. 3. "The Belly-button song", done by Sam Speckhard, Mary Speckhard, Lisa Speckhard, and (I'm sorry) a few others who I forgot the names of at the moment. This one wasn't my favorite, but it was funny nonetheless.  Worst performance: "Wonderful World", I think that's what it was called, but it was the last performance for the day other than the teachers' performance. Steve Hutt and Jared Foster weren't particularly animated, and they used a digital projector.  On Friday night, I went over to Dylans, and discovered that I suck really horribly at DDR.  Saturday: My attempts to gather enough strength to get my chores done and go skiing failed me, and I ended up losing to Derrick in Starcraft after about 2.5 hours of back and fourth air battles. And yes, it is possible to beat 3 boards of Halo in 3 hours. Even when the boards are 343 Guilty Spark, the Library, and Two Betrayals. It's even possible to skip the final large battle in Two Betrayals by gunning in with a ghost, and flinging yourself into a banshee and hoping you don't get a plasma grenade stuck on you.  Sunday: This was "go to Church, do chores, do homework, and no time for anything else" day.  Blah, blah, and blah. I wish the snow would either magically turn to skiable snow, or go away all together so I can go biking. One or the other.  My comments on Ralph Nader: He's an egotistical candidate, and all he is doing is hurting the democratic party by taking away very liberal democratic votes. A vote for Nader is a vote for Bush. I wish he wouldn't run...it's going to be like the last election DAMMIT!  "I know a charm that will heal with a touch. "I know a charm that will turn aside the weapons of an enemy. "I know another charm to free myself from all bonds and locks. "A fifth charm: I can catch an arrow in flight and take no harm from it." His words were quiet, urgent. Gone was the hectoring tone, gone was the grin. Wednesday spoke as if he were reciting the words of a religious ritual, or remembering something dark and painful. "A sixth: spells sent to hurt me will hurt only the sender. "A seventh charm I know: I can quench a fire simply by looking at it. "An either: if any man hates me, I can win his friendship. "A ninth: I can sing to the wind to sleep and calm a storm for long enough to bring a ship to shore. "Those were the first nine charms I learned. Nine nights I hung on the bare tree, my side pierced with a spear's point. I swayed and blew in the cold winds and the hot winds, without food, without water, a sacrifice of myself to myself, and the worlds opened to me. "For a tenth charm, I learned to dispel witches, to spin them around in the skies so that they will never find their way back to their own homes. "An eleventh: if I sing it when a battle rages it can take warriors through the tumult unscathed and unhurt, and bring them safely back to their hearths and their homes. "A twelfth charm I know: if I see a hanged man I can bring him down from the gallows to whisper to us all he remembers. "A thirteenth: if I sprinkle water on a child's head, that child will never fall in battle. "A fourteenth. I know the names of all the gods. Every damned one of them. "A fifteenth: I have a dream of power, of glory, and of wisdom, and I can make people believe my dreams." His voice was so low now that Shadow had to strain to hear it over the plane's engine noise. "Sixteenth charm I know: if I need love I can turn the mind and heart of any woman. "A seventeenth, that no woman I want will ever want another. "And I know an eighteenth charm, and that charm is the greatest of all, and that charm I can tell to no man, for a secret that no one knows but you is the most powerful secret there can ever be."  ~~Exerpt from American Gods, by Neil Gaiman.

      I was kinda hoping to see Jimmy Carter at the festival today-that would have made it a bit more worthwhile. I mean, who really wants to see Dave Dahl host it? He's a conservative and he told a really bad joke. We only played for about 15 minutes total, whereas the whole event was multiple hours.  Recap: 9:00- Waiting in the Great Hall at MSA for the buses that were supposed to be there at 8:00. Basically standing around, messing with the piano and such. 9:50- Somewhere around that time slot, the buses finally arrived. Two nice and street-dirty yellow school buses. Without a trailer for all the stuff. "Stuff" includes, the drumset, plenty of alternative percussion, mallets, 2 portable keyboards, a large bass amp, two guitar amps, music stands, hand drum stands, and countless string intruments including a guitar and a cumbersome cello. What a joy that was loading and unloading-4 times. 10:30 to 1:22 (real specific...lol)- Milled around, ate my lunch that I had already eaten on the bus, set up, and sound checked. 1:22 and beyond- Played Imagine, and listened to the other choirs and stuff.  *Why?* Three MSA choir members, whose names will not be mentioned, sat out on singing "O Colored Earth", because it contained the ideal that all animals are equal, peace and love and whatnot. The should still have to sing. If a Jewish person was in a choir, or a Hindu or Buddhist or whatever for that matter, and had to sing Christian songs, they don't have to believe it. However, they should still have to sing it. Otherwise, this will lead to people saying, "Oh, I don't believe in this line here-I won't sing it". Just sing the damned song and don't make a fuss of it. Geez.  Recently, there's been some questioning about Bush bringing back the Draft. However, he wouldn't do it until he's elected this time around. That poses some serious questions about everyone our age. In two years, enlist? register? resist? or move to Canada? So many people would be in an uproar about this...  Our current military status is that most of our troops are either in Iraq, coming back from Iraq in a coffin, or going to Iraq. When will this end? The only reason the Draft would be reinstated is Bush being a war monger, and needing more troops. If the draft came back, our country would be divided much moreso than even between the radical leftists and neo-conservatives. Well, I guess you could always move to Europe too. Yeah, I'd rather go to Europe than Canada-too close to Bush...I'm sick of it all!  On another quite positive note, this f@#$ing storm that we're supposed to get tonight is going to dump pissy rain on us instead of snow. That'll ruin even the downhill skiing base at Afton, Welch Village, or Wild Mountain, let alone the cross-country trails all over the metro. I really need to go somewhere where there's a real winter and I can actually enjoy it...Switzerland, France-somewhere near the Alps. This pair of cross-country skis I bought are going absolutely nowhere. Damn the whether. Damn global warming. Damn Bush. Damn people who don't give a f@#^ about the environment!  As I've said before, some things in life are impossible to forget. No matter where you go.

      This damned cold won't go away! I'm sick (haha) of it. Even nasal decongestants aren't working really well. Although, my sore throat did cease to annoy me since yesterday.  I see a trend coming on... Daily Recap: Math: Yet another warning to never slack off in pre-calculus. It won't do you any good. Chapter 7 is a bitch, and of course we have a test next week on Thursday on it. Wahoo Science: I'm almost amazed that the whole test was 50 points of pure multiple choice. Seemed almost too easy... Band: The whole band setup has been flipped into another universe. In other words, the percussion section was moved to the other side of the room in order to accomidate risers for the choir (grrrr). Now it's even more cramped back there.             *Anouncement: The Nobel Peace Prize festival is tommorow. The Random, choir, and orchestra will be attending.* Spanish: Gee, that test was either than I thought...(::cough cheat cough::).  Random Spanish Funny of the day: They just don't give up, do they? Pat and Anton continued to try to hit on me for some reason. Whatever it is, it's kinda disturbing...  English: HAHAHAHA to all that have to take the test tommorow! Thank (insert higher being here) for that festival... Social: I really do wonder if Nathaniel has ever pulled off the "stack of random papers and one has the answers on it" method of cheating on a social test.  Day by day I ask myself more often, "Why don't the other candidates drop out? I mean, Kerry's got it." It's not doing Dean any good attacking Kerry, whereas Kerry is relentlessly going after Bush's extremely abundant flaws. Seems to be working quite nicely. Keepin' the pressure on is the best way.  Random Bush fact: President Bush has had the fewest press conferences of every President. Want to know why? Because at his first press conferences he royally screwed up. Why don't people notice?  Another Random Bush fact: President Bush also refuses to acknowledge the lady's existence, who, I cannot recall the name of, but has  always  been asked for the very first question in  any  presidential press conference. In fact, he had her put in the back of the room, and won't acknowledge her after he did in his first press conference. Want to know why? Because she asked him a tough question which a president  should  be able to answer. Not Bush though, because he's a swaggerin' braggerin' Texas idiot for a president. Bush is going to have his ass handed to him on a gold platter in the debates, no doubt.

      I've got a goodly amount of homework, and some American Gods reading to do tonight, so I'll try and make this pretty quick. Yeah, that trip wasn't a whole lot of fun. It just made me get sick easier. Now I've got a horrendous stuffy nose with a mild sore throat. What f@#%ing fun.  Daily Recap: Math: Bleh Science: Test tommorow-and all 58 points or so are multiple choice!! Band: On Thursday, the Random (the MSA jazz improv), the choir, and the orchestra will be playing at the annual Nobel Peace Prize Festival at Augsburg College. The event runs all day, so unless you're going for your school, you won't be able to come. Spanish: RaNdOm SpAnIsH fUnNy Of ThE dAy: Mrs. Sustic asked Pat if he was going to cheat on the test by giving answers to someone else-half the class took it today, and the other half tommorow. She failed to think that Pat still did. English: Finish To Kill a Mockingbird tonight. The play that's coming up should be interesting. Social: Test tommorow! Blah, it shouldn't be too hard.  Anyways, back to the better part. I bought, or more like owe half of, a pair of Fischer classic cross-country skis today at White Wolf in Woodbury. It's kinda late in the season, but I should, er...hope...I'll be able to use them soon. Now I've got downhill skis and cross-country. I'll also be going back up north (hopefully I won't get deathly sick, and/or injure myself) to ski at Lutsen for two days. I also got a bad rap for wearing my hat today and looking like a "skater fag", to quote Derrick and everyone else. Apparently I looked too much like Ryan (sorry Kacy).  Apparently I look too much like everyone...

      Yep, I'm back home early from my "vacation", if that's what you want to call it. I'll tell you why: My dad conveniently got quite sick, preventing us from going up to Lutsen to ski today. Thus, we came home.  Weekend recap: Friday: With hopefull prospects for the weekend, we headed north, packed for 2 days of pure skiing. Derrick's mother came along, so that meant a few good hours of talk talk talk. Good thing for headphones.  I basically spent that driving time being absolutely wiped out from that week, listening to The Wallflowers, Red Letter Days, and having some good thinking time.  Saturday: I attempted to cross-country ski using combi-skis, a cross between classic and skate, but failed slightly. I'll obviously have to work on using those things. However, I did have a damn funny faceplant in the snow, along with a big stupid blister on my foot after that.  For the remainder of the afternoon, I spent my time testing the slopes out at Spirit Mountain on Valentine's Day. Alone. It gets damn cold up there too...  Sunday: Waking up with one hell of a stiff neck, only to find out you have a sore throat and you're not going up to Lutsen for the day is not, to say the least, enjoyable. The horrendous neck was from a few "crash and burn" yardsales I had in the Terrain Park, which I care not to mention. Needless to say, I walked away that night with a stiff neck, a hyperextended thumb, and a damaged confidence dealing with a pair of skis.  That pretty much brings it all up to the current moment, and my feet are still cold. arg.

      I've only got 5 minutes, so I'll try to make this update a highly concentrated piece of random rambling, containing the most information possible that may or may not interest you.  The week so far: crap, except for when one of the gorillas at the zoo tried to bust out and kill Kevin Rosenberg...that was funny.  This week has been pretty much junk so far. Although, I did check out two excellent, and I mean that wholeheartedly, books, both by an author that should be more widely recognized-much more. You get 3 guesses: 1. Tom Clancy? no 2. Michael Moore? no...lol 3. Al Franken? he should be, but no  Give up? Well here's a clue: He's from British, er, in other words, he's British.  Ok fine, I'll tell you: Neil Gaiman is the guy, and Stardust and American Gods (highly recommended!!) are the novels. But I do warned you, these books aren't for everyone. They are generally exclusively for people who actually  want  to read, and not just books required for English class. Also, you need an adult mind, as it is the definition of an "adult book". Everyone's assignment: find out more about this author, and write an 8-page report on him. j/k  As for this weekend, I'll be cross-country skiing and downhill skiing up north at Duluth and Lutsen, respectively. Should be hellafun, so as long as I don't break anything performing a 360 helicopter.  Well, I must be going, as the old man needs the internet.  Again, I thank everyone who has given me the ideas and such for this blog. I especially thank Amelia for recommending that wonderful book-it's a must read for all book junkies out there.

      Haven't done this thing in a while, so I guess I'll update it now.  Weekend recap: Friday: Looking forward to a weekend with minimal homework, I went over to Dan's place to play magic and halo with him and Josh (yet again). I ended up arriving back home at the lovely hour of midnight. I honestly think Josh needs to work on his trading skills...  Saturday: I basically lounged around all day, did my chores, didn't do my homework, and thought about going skiing for the evening. I ended up not going. I didn't go anywhere on Saturday, but even yet the night was fun. Yep, I'm an AIM addict-majorly.  Sunday: I completed that weekend's homework in the car going to and from church, which was followed by a a pilgrimage to Afton Alps with Matt and Dan. We are the trifector, the kings of the bowl, the masters of big air-whatever you want to call us...lol Yeah, basically we're just really really insane people who are wrongly handed a pair of skis. Crash of the day: When cutting across a run, with me a little ways behind Matt, Matt colided with a woman snowboarder. Her board clipped his skis, sending her flying through the air to a harsh landing on her back/head, with no helmet mind you. So while the three of us were waiting next to her, her "big and bad" boyfriend arrived. I explained what happened. Exerpts from the conversation: "You kids better watch where the fuck you're going!" "Get the fuck out of here!" And yet, she wasn't wearing a helmet, it was an accident, and only one of us was in the damned crash in the first place. Tell me how does that merit this guy transforming into a huge jackass?!  Okay, back to the now. Daily recap:  Math: I discovered today, yes after a full semester of not knowing, that we could use our notes on the tests. And yet, I still managed all A's on them-huh?  Science: I guess this week could be called "Simian Week", since we're studying all of the primates that we, as a human race, are killing off by destroying their habitat in The Democratic Republic of the Congo, among other places. Mrs. Bartlett somehow managed to misplace my permission slip too-at least I'm fairly sure of it-so now I have to pay again. Como Zoo should be fun-seeing how apes react to new toys and foods and such.  Band: Well, it depends on what band you're talking about. In regular band, I finished all of my pre-calc homework, thanks to the vast black void of rest bars that implanted themselves on my part to Berceuse and Finale-The Firebird Suite. As for Jazz Improv, we were officially christened "The Random" at today's rehearsal. That's been our long-standing idea for a name, and it's about time it went through. If I am correct, The Random, along with other random bands will be performing at MSA's Jazz Coffeehouse on April 13th. Everyone needs to come. Yes, that means you. Oh-and you over there-yeah you-you need to show up or else.  Spanish: This upcoming test is going to be rather of a big b@!#%, according to Nathaniel. The random spanish funnies of the day have returned!: 1. Again, Matt is the source of this one. When asked repeatedly what the answer of a question was, while he "struggled" with getting the right answer, he stuck in a few "penis"s here and there. The whole right side of the classroom couldn't help from laughing violently. 2. After Eric got all of the verbs and more wrong in answering a question, after which Mrs. Sustic had CLEARLY explained everything, we were assigned that section as homework-it was quite a bit. Nathaniel's and my responses: "Nice listening, Eric."  English: We started reading the next chapter in To Kill a Mockingbird in the format of "reader's theatre", in which people get the parts. I formidably received the role of Narrator-I'm a fairly good speaker anyhow.  Social: The Crusades are currently receiving the honor of being the subject of Jam-master Shoeb's classes for 9th grade...lol. I wonder if we'll cover the search for the holy grail...  "That's enough of that!"

      At least today was better than last night-jeez I felt like crap. This week has been tough so far-I've been sleep deprived, feeling like crap, overworked with stuff, and no block days with study halls. Damned 8th graders... So, this week's Thursday and Friday have been straight up 6 period days.  Warning: Never slack off in pre-calculus. You'll regret it.  Random thought: Studies show that glasses may improve your IQ by at least 5%. Not really...lol, but they do make you feel smarter.  Random Spanish Funny:  When asked what the imperfect progressive conjugation of the verb "pagar" is, Matt follows by answering with several different variations of the conjugations, "vaginando" and "pagina". That was again coupled with another round of "the penis game". This oddly enough sounds somewhat like something Jimmy Fallon would say during Weekend Update.  As for English, To Kill a Mockingbird is getting even better. The trial has started, so that's going to pick things up a bit. Biology was even better...lol: As the video People of the Forest got going, Matt, Sam, Pat, and Anton played the penis game, only they replaced "penis", with "Saali's hot". Needless to say, it got her furious, which as we all know, is mucho comico. Things got worse though when they did that to me. Then Pat started hitting on me...blegh. Pat'll never get Kacy-no matter how much or hard he strokes her hair.  To follow the pattern of weekend skiing, I may go again this weekend. However, the following week I will be skiing like hell up at Lutsen Mountains and Spirit Mountain up north-what fun.  I take it you've had enough of my talking for one night, so I'll just go into that corner over there...Actually, I'm not going back into the corner. I've got some social reading and math to do, so I gotta scram.  Thank you to everyone who has given me things to ramble on about...hehe.

      Geez, I'm really needing to put more effort into doing this ::blinks:: damn I'm tired. You would be too if you did everything I did, and still managed to do as well in school without going crazy. I don't know what it is lately, but it seems like I need to cut something out of what I do. Or maybe there's a gap that needs to be filled somewhere. I don't know what it is, but something needs to be done. This is apparently what winter does to you.

      Yeah yeah yeah, shutup! I missed a few days on this thing, more like 4, but oh well. You know what? District 833 sucks almost as bad as homework-we haven't had a snowday since the damned first grade, and we should have had one yesterday. But did we...? NO. There's somewhere around 1.5 to 2 feet of snow on the ground, and school isn't cancelled. I think there's something wrong with that-we deserved a day off.  Recap of the time I didn't blog: Friday: I went over to Dan's place and played Magic/Halo with him and Josh for the evening. Saturday: I cleaned the whole damn house, did homework, and took my last resort for a Saturday nightlife-the Underground. It's gettin' kinda lame right now-I guess not as many people are going. Or maybe it's just me wishing I was able to do something better than that. Sunday: I didn't go to church because of the snow, so I decided to go skiing all day-not a good idea, since I had to do all the shoveling too. To keep it simple, my back still hurts. Monday: Jazz band, along with all other after-school activities were cancelled, leaving me more time to not do my homework, and to avoid studying the Social test. In other words, my drum lesson and homework ruled my night. Tuesday: Not nearly as much homework, but I don't know who I'm going to take to the Ice Palace tonight, if I'm going. And hey-guess what. Valentine's day means nothing to me this year-it never really has, and I don't think it will anytime soon.  Random Spanish funny of the day: Mrs. Sustic decides to read Nathaniel's paragraph on the places to see in the city of Mexico. Of course, the paragraph is a bunch of random crap, literally. Needless to say, it was pretty damn funny.  Now this is the kind of winter weather I love. We actually have snow, and the skiing is hellafun in fresh powder too. The other night when it was snowing, I was thinking how much I'd like to have someone to enjoy all this with. Oh wait-I'm dreaming again.

      There are soooo many concerts coming up, its insane. Somewhere around 10.  April 4th: Random at Central Park  April 13th: Jazz coffeehouse at MSA, 7:00.  April 20th: Spring concert at MSA, 7:00.  April 21st: MCTC concert with Random, 7:30.  April 30th: RANDOM concert at MOA!!! Should be fun. *LOCK-IN AT MSA THAT NIGHT*  May 1st: MSA choir concert at Central Park, 7:00.  May 15th: Orchestra concert  May 23rd: Orchestra concert  All that, plus rehearsals, other stuff, yeah...its almost too much.  English paper status: 1.5 pages done, outline turned in.  A small recap:  Math: started chapter 11 yesterday.  Science: Did a web assignment that looked like it was for 8 year olds.  Band: Same old, same old, except there was real fun going on in the trumpet section today...Mr. Shelton had to work that out. I'm sorry, but our trumpet section sucks. Its sound is weak, its 3 players weak, and PETER KARLSTRAND can't play the right f*cking notes. EVER. I know I don't play the trumpet, but if I took lessons, I could play better than him in a few months easily. He fumbles constantly with notes, and our spring concert is 3 weeks away. We NEED our trumpets to play the right notes on Berceuse and Finale. More like we need a few trumpets BACK at MSA. Lets see...Amanda...Eric Gross...Pat Setley...it sucks having a trumpet section of 3, with only 2 people who really know what they're doing.  Spanish: Working on the city maps. etc. etc. etc.  English: 1.5 pages done, and working.  Social: presentations will finish tommorow, current events the same. I'm just thankful we don't have a social studies teacher who brings their own opinions into the classroom. Although...I'm starting to think he's conservative...  I really think I do too much, I think too much, and I try to analyze things way too much. I try to see the ends of everything, and when they're not there, I search even more. Over analyzation takes up too much time. And if I can't analyze something to my liking, I analyze more. Maybe its because I'm Irish, maybe its because I'm German, but I was born like that. It's tough being an overthinker...

      I revamped my anti-Bush section in my profile. It now contains the following material: 1. Original cabinet member names and aliases  "Bush=Chief Shrub Condoleeza Rice=Condomleeza Rice (copyright Ian Crinean) Donald Rumsfeld=Donny Rum-filled John Ashcroft=Johnny Asscraft"  2. A wonderful quote from me:  "Condomleeza, Rum-filled, Asscraft-they're all in the same bed together in the White House. I say we torch the joint before the real fucking begins."  3. And the 10 reasons why an azalea bush is better than our Chief Shrub (I did not write this):  1.     An azalea bush doesn’t have a face of stupidity and dullness; a face if seen can make the viewer think “What a bloody moron!” An azalea bush doesn’t even have a face. 2.     An azalea bush can’t speak, so it doesn’t have the ability to testify before a committee; and therefore it cannot tell a lie.  3.     An azalea bush can’t have it’s head up it’s ass while running the country, because a) an azalea bush has no head; b) an azalea bush hasn’t any ass, and c) An azalea bush cannot run the country because it is an inanimate object. 4.     An azalea bush be used as a publicity ploy for a political party because a) an azalea bush cannot be apart of a political party; and b) they haven’t come up with a military flight jacket wearable by your average azalea bush. 5.     An azalea bush can’t avenge their father’s supreme screw-ups with an even bigger screw-up because a) azalea bushes can’t avenge anything; b) azalea bushes don’t have fathers; and c) azalea bushes cannot screw up in the first place, let alone supremely. 6.     An azalea bush can’t screw the entire American populace with their pants on simultaneously. An azalea bush cannot screw anything to begin with; with or without pants on. 7.     An azalea cannot wreck an economy, because a) they can’t order tax cuts; b) they cannot run a budget; and c) they do not hold the nation’s checkbook between their ass cheeks – They have no ass; nor cheeks for said ass, ergo, there is no “between”. 8.     An azalea cannot feed verbal bullshit to the entire nation while being sanctioned by the Electoral College.  9.     An azalea bush cannot speak. 10. An azalea bush doesn’t hold the key to the nukes in a hallowed out copy of “Playboy” that has a cover that reads “500 ways to screw the nation with their pants on.  Thanks to Ian Crinean for coming up with that.  60 Minutes on CBS tonight was classic-Condomleeza dished out the usual bullshit lies, evaded the questions asked of her, and LIED LIED LIED!!!!!  Here's a song that describes our very own Chief Dumbass quite frankly:  "Since I was a child I've tried to be what I'm not I've lied and I've enjoyed it all my life I lied to my dear mother to my sisters and my brother and now I'm lying to my children and my wife Big Hat, no cattle Big head, no brain Big snake, no rattle I forever remain big hat, no cattle I knew from the start Big boat, no paddle Big belly, no heart  Can't remember why I do it, Oh, maybe I can. An honest man these days is hard to find. I only know we're living in an unforgiving land. And a little lie can buy some real big piece of mind.  Oftimes I wondered what might I have become, Had I but buckled down and really tried. But when it came down to the wire I called my family to my side Stood up straight, threw my head back and I lied, lied,lied  Big hat, no cattle Big shoes, well you know... Big horse, no saddle He goes wherever I go  Big hat, no cattle Right from the start Big guns, no battle Big belly, no heart  When it came down to the wire I called my little family to my side Stood up straight, threw my head back and I lied, lied,lied lied, lied, lied  Big hat, no cattle Big head, no brain Big snake, no rattle I forever remain Big hat, no cattle I knew from the start Big boat, no paddle Big belly, no heart Big boat, no paddle Big belly, no heart"

      That describes several things here: Spring Break School English essay the day  It's the end of spring break, and actually the only reason I mind going back to school is English. I don't know how this works, but this year spring break spelled b-o-r-i-n-g. literally. It's the beginning of school again, and other than English, I honestly don't mind it. Jazz band's fun. My english essay has a beginning, middle, and end that are non-existent as of right now. The outline is done, and I don't want to do any more work on that stupid thing. It's also the middle of the day-4:00, and boring as hell.  Here's how my day went: Rose at 7:30, after 7 and a half hours of sleep. Didn't feel that good after coming off of 10 hours the previous night. I left for church at 8:50, arrived at 9:20. Waited around for family mass to start. Half-way through, the suit-sporting me (lol) played a short, 2 minute piano piece, Reflection, by George Winston. I never would have thought of this happening in Church, but there was enough applause for me to fit in about 3-4 bows. No lie. And the family mass isn't that big of an audience compared to the main mass.  May 23rd: I get the honor of playing a 3 minute piece, most likely Joy by George Winston, at both main masses. Whoohoo-I get to wear a suit again. It also happens to be the day of the WYO's Pops and Popcorn concert at Central Park, Woodbury. I wonder how many bows I'll be taking that day...  Other than the mentionings and praise at Church, today has been downright dreary. I finished my English outline, used up my time online already, and the weather absolutely sucks. Hopefully the latter part of this week will be as good as they say it will...

      Crap. Only a day and a half until break's over. It sure goes by fast...too damn f*cking fast. There was so much I wish I had done that I didn't get to do, and a few things that I did get to do.  What I did do: 1. Went to orchestra and registered 2. Shot pool 3. Stay up until 1 and sleep until noon. Damn does that feel good.  What I haven't done/didn't do: 1. See Ladykillers 2. See Secret Window 3. See lotr with Amanda 4. Shoot pool more than once 5. Go to the underground at all-yep, I skipped 2 weeks. 6. homework...uh...yeah...::shifty eyes::  What I have to do as of yet: 1. Prepare a song to play at church tommorow 2. Homework...stupid f*cking english...  I did FINALLY get my rear tube replaced after I screwed up the valve by using a hand pump too vigorously. I need a good floor pump for presta valves...so now my white bike's in working order. Time to work on that Orbea without killing it and having to pay for it...(its a rental).  And about that title. I ate dinner at Ciatti's tonight, and I ate enough food for 2 Italians-that's one sh*t load of food, I tell ya. lol. Let's see...: Around 7 breadsticks A very large plate of spaghetti 2 glasses of water 1 root beer 1 large slice of extremely rich cheese cake  And dinner is supposed to be the smallest meal for a bicyclist...I woke up at 11:30 and ate lunch. lol.  Yep, so that's how my week's been. Pretty lazy, not doing a whole lot, staying up until 1 playing starcraft, getting up at 11:00, skipping right to lunch. It's been a good break, but back to school...more like back to HELL (a.k.a. english).  So there you have it. What I've done, what I haven't done, and what I don't want to do at all.  Couldn't find a song because my damn comp is being an ass and won't run another internet explorer window. So here's a little couplet I just wrote that, I hope, does not describe anyone's life.  "Going downhill and I lost the track Going downhill, and I ain't coming back"

      I FINALLY got to go play pool today, and was beaten 3 out of 5 games by Dan...grr...oh well. We left about 20 minutes from closing time, which was 10:00. My dad and grandpa bowled, I shot pool, pretty fun.  Now its 12:00 midnight, I'm updating my blog for the first time in 2 days (you're welcome, Amanda...lol), and I'm tired as hell.  Along with "Anything for Excitement", I now have yet another project on my table, "Jesus Mobile", a more Christian-based song. Lyrics by Amanda, orchestration (if I ever get around to it) done by me. That's 2 now, so I've got some work to do, erm, today. lol. Plus that english outline. I wish everyone would be gone tommorow so I can compose in peace, but nooo! My dad HAS to have the day off...plus the pianos aren't exactly secluded...  Hmm...what did I do today: worked on the numerous bikes on my porch to prepare them for picking (my grandparents wanted a few). In the process of attempting to pump up my own bike's rear tire, I blew the valve. Dammit. Now there's another thing I need to fix. PLUS, we don't have a good fricking quality floor pump for presta valves. grrr! AND the rear wheel on my rental Orbea needs truing, AND 2 spokes need replacing on my white Trek's front wheel. PLUS my Specialized Sport bike computer broke today, so that's done for. I'm ordering 2 wireless computers for 25 each, and that's half off. 1 for the Trek, 1 for the Orbea. Hopefully I'll get these bikes in genuine working fashion soon enough. The season isn't too far off...  What I didn't do today: practice piano and drums (*gasp*), spend a ton of time on AIM, like I usually do, or do any homework whatsoever.  What I did do today: update my blog (duh...)  Well, I believe its time for me to check out and heed my own closing time.  "Closing time Open all the doors and let you out into the world Closing time Turn all of the lights on over every boy and every girl Closing time One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey or beer Closing time You don't have to go home but you can't stay here   I know who I want to take me home I know who I want to take me home I know who I want to take me home  Closing time Time for you to go out to the places you will be from Closing time This room won't be open till your brothers or your sisters come So gather up your jackets, move it to the exits I hope you have found a friend Closing time Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end  I know who I want to take me home I know who I want to take me home I know who I want to take me home Take me home"

      Yeah, yeah, yeah. 3 posts in one day-are you nuts?? Well, its almost Wednesday so shut up.  "Anything for Excitement" happens to be the title of an original composition, lyrics by Amanda, piano, guitar, and vocals parts written by me. I'm the one with music theory training. I won't post the lyrics up here since they're under copyright protection (lol), and if you want them, don't ask me. As of now, it's a ballad in B flat minor, for anyone who knows what the hell I'm talking about. Should be fun-I haven't done any composing in a while, so I'll see what happens.  Oh, and btw: the bari-sax kicks a$$!

      Heehee! There's only two instruments that you can do that with out there-electric bass, and bari sax. The latter I'm learning in about a month or so (!!!). That sax rocks...  Really all I need to learn is how to tongue it correctly, and all the fingerings-yeah...minor parts...it'll be awesome though.  I can't start a brass instrument until I get my braces off...grrr. Oh well.  I have to run before my parents hang me, so I'll close with a quote that happens to come off of one of Mr. Shelton's coffee cups.  "I'm hip, I'm cool. I'm a happenin' fool!"

      Its no fun being trapped in your house...well...more like stranded really. No one's able to go anywhere, and I'm stuck in my room listening to music, and not wanting to go to drums and piano tonight. Oh-and then I have to complete the stupid English interview tonight with my piano teacher...what fun. God I hate English...  This spring break has pretty much sucked so far-I haven't been able to do anything out of the ordinary yet, and its already going on halfway through. Some of the snow's still around, which I want erradicated from this area, badly. Plus, its not warm enough to do stuff yet...grr....  And I thought rainy days were depressing. Its amazing how boring a sunny day can be when you've got nothing in the world to do.  "Well it seems like I'm caught up in your trap again And it seems like I'll be wearin' the same ol' chains Good will conquer evil and the truth will set you free Then I know someday I'll find the key Then I know somewhere I'll find the key Well it seem like I've been playin' the game way too long And it seems the game I played has made you strong Well when the game is over, I won't walk out a loser And I know that I'll walk out of here again And I know that someday I'll walk out of here again  But now I'm trapped...Oh yeah! Trapped...Oh yeah yeah! Trapped...Oh yeah! Trapped...Oh yeah!  Now it seems like I've been sleepin' in your bed too long And it seems like you've been meanin' to do me harm But I'll teach my eyes to see beyond these walls in front of me And someday I'll walk out of here again Yeah I know someday I'll walk out of here again  But now I'm trapped...Oh yeah!

      Yeah, the dentist sucks, especially when you have braces for several years like me. Thank God I'm getting them off this fall...I hope. Probably by September. Then comes the permanent retainer. What fun...  I hope this stuff wears off soon. I don't want my lip feeling limp all day.  Well, in contrast to my last entry, I'll put here a list of misfortunes...lol: 1. Biking Accidents: -When I was about 4, I split my chin open when a wheel came off of a plastic tricycle. I remember it too...hurt like a bitch. -Riding my bike into the DQ parking lot a few years ago, my front wheel somehow became lodged on the driveway, so I went flying ass over teakettle. Even though I had my aerobars on the bike at the time, the first part of me that hit pavement: my chin. Felt so damn numb I didn't feel any pain. Needed 3 stitches too. -Riding my bike at 10:30 in the evening late last summer, I came upon a large patch of sand and grit on a corner. Being the racer I am, I took it like a racer. Slid over 5 feet too, wearing a t-shirt and, yep, shorts. To this day I still have a scar on my right elbow.  *Those are just some of the reasons why I always ride on the right side of the street and wear a helmet...lol*  Hmmm....surgeries...: 1. Ear Surgeries -Countless sets of tubes, starting when I was somewhere around 1 or younger -3 Mastoid ectomies (removing the mastoid bone in my ear because it was infected), 1 on the right and 2 on the left. Believe me, you don't ever want to have a big bandage around half of your head for 3 days-it gets unbearingly itchy. -A good amount of timpanoplasties (not sure how its spelled), which is when an ear drum is patched up.  *These are the reasons why I have hearing loss, and have to wear ear plugs a lot...dammit*  I'll stop there, because I don't want to sound like I'm griping or writing a book titled, "One Thousand and One Misfortunes"...lol. Thankfully, I've never broken a bone. I probably will though, if I ever get in a large pile up in a race *knocks on desk*.  I race and I ski recklessly...lol. If I didn't wear helmets, I might not be here today.  Here's a slightly appropriate song: "When I was 10, fell out of bed Got three stitches in my head It hurt like hell I saw the blood, I felt the pain I'd like to feel it once again 'Cause I don't feel it Then I got stung, right on the face I screamed and ran around the place It hurt like hell I swoll right up, I burned for days I'd like to feel it once again Cause when you touch me When you hold me When you kiss me I don't feel anything When you touch me When you hold me When you kiss me It's just like Novocaine I remember every cut and scrape I'm alone so long Something's wrong So I'll take anything I slap my face, I pull my hair Just to see if something's there It should hurt like hell I miss the pinch, I miss the pain That shock sensation in my brain Cause when you touch me When you hold me When you kiss me I don't feel anything When you touch me When you hold me When you kiss me I don't feel anything When you touch me (when you touch me) When you hold me (when you hold me) When you kiss me I don't feel it When you touch me (when you touch me) When you hold me (when you hold me) When you kiss me It's just like Novocaine I don't feel anything I don't feel it I don't feel it I don't feel it Well, I don't feel it No, I don't feel it I don't feel it"  "Novocaine", Alice Cooper

      Well, today wasn't exactly bloody, except for over in Iraq *cough, I  won't  go on a rant right now, cough*. However, you could call it a bloody boring Sunday. Geez, my parents are gone at a concert (woot), and its too cold to bike anywhere, really. Plus none of my friends could do anything. This left me stuck at home for the evening...with nothing to do but walk the dogs, do the dishes, and play piano. Oh-and go online...  How my day went: 8:30-got up, etc. 10:15-left for church 12:50-got home from church 4:00-went over to Dan's 5:45-came home from Dan's because his parents weren't home, meaning they couldn't take us to the U of M student center to shoot pool, and his dad took away his TV and Xbox controllers, meaning we couldn't play halo. 6:05-ate dinner 6:30 to the current time: I've been interspersing being online while doing the dishes, recycling, walking the dogs, and playing piano.  I don't think I'll make it long enough to watch the other movie that I rented last night, "Runaway Jury". I'm fading fast, and its not fun to be really tired at 9:13 on Sunday evening on Spring Break. *yawns* ugh.  I'll put the lyrics in the middle, since I don't feel like closing with them tonight. *there will be more content after this*  "Bop bop.  Care about the moonlight and holding you tight and asking my questions. Everyone loves a situation.  Long walks on the beach. The press will impeach. Lately I'm finding I am the book and you are the binding.  I guess they'll read everything about you. Though the press might shoot me down I'm still true. I sell my book for free. That's what you do to me.  Oh, you are my family tree. Be good to me Take care of me.  Bop bop.  There's hotels in the sea, Trash in the sky., The net-dustry's growing. Stick to love songs kid, that's all you're knowing.  They push you away or tie you up. It don't really matter. But if your head is up you won't get much sadder.  But who am I to preach a word or two when I can't lift my own head without you? If my mental state kept you from coming around I hope the world would shoot me down for losing you. A broken branch I'd be if you weren't grown to me.  Oh, you are my family tree. Be good to me. Be good to me. Be good to me. Take care of me.  Bop bop."  "Family Tree", Ben Kweller  Nights like this just give you time for whatever. I use it to think. *a peak inside my head* I just sometimes think of how lucky I am. I mean, I take drum lessons, piano lessons, I own a piano, a drumset, I do well in school, I'm able to be a cyclist in the summer, I have a monopoly on the lawn mowing business in St. Paul Park (lol). I've got my own computer with internet, and I've got parents who know when the shut the [expletive] up, well, most of the time...lol. I'm also priveledged to not have any video game systems (*gasp*). Yeah, they'd just take up more of my time that could be spent playing piano, or talking to important people...lol. A lot of these things have to deal with material objects, but there's one thing that stands out. For the past 3 weeks this Thursday, I've been, I don't know, more positive. My overall outlook has changed, I look forward to more things, and my school weeks go by faster. The weekends seem even more like a green light to go and get out there, do things and go places. Even during the week its better, namely Mondays. Fridays are pretty much a gateway to the weekend, a stretch of smooth, black pavement that leads to that green light.  All of that stems from one gift I'm quite thankful for, and very lucky to have: a girl who cares about me as much as I care about her, which happens to be quite a bit. Thanks, Amanda.

      Eh, tonight wasn't all what it cracked up to be...I think. I was SUPPOSED to go play pool and go bowling at the U of M student center, but no one would go. And the people who said they might, didn't. blerg. I'm itching to try and duplicate that double-shot that I literally dropped jaws with last week at the underground. lol. Maybe tommorow night or something. And don't ask me to describe that shot-I already tried it, and its quite hard to picture it. Just ask Amelia.  I should probably get my own cue sometime. Then I can become a pool-shark/hustler for the rest of my life. Great prospect, huh? Not really...  To quote Pat, "My head feels so...naked!" Yes, I did it. I had a hair cut. Now its short (omg!). I look like a whole different person, its kinda creepy. Hopefully my personality doesn't change-I like that the way it is very much. Grr...now I get cold quicker. Oh well, I'll grow it out again, and it should be long again by the time MITY rolls around. I lost so much hair...meh-I got pictures of me with the long hair right before I cut it lol.  Some people will probably look at me and say, "oh my god what did you do?", well, here's a Ben Folds Five lyric:  "What I've kept with me And what I've thrown away And where the hell I've ended up On this glary random day Were the things I've really cared about Just left along the way For being too pent up and proud  Woke up way too late Feeling hungover and old And the sun was shining bright And I walked barefoot down the road Started thinking about my old man Want to get into a car and go anywhere  Here I stand, sad and free I can't cry, I can't see What I've done Oh God, what have I done?  Don't you know I'm numb, man? I can't feel a thing at all Now it's all smiles and business these days I'm indifferent to the loss I have faith that there's a soul somewhere That's leading me around I wonder if she knows Which way is up and which is down  Here I stand, sad and free I can't cry, I can't see What I've done Oh God, what have I done?  I poured my heart out I poured my heart out It evaporated ... see?  Blind man at a canyon's edge Of a panoramic scene Or maybe I'm a kite that's flying high and random Dangling a string Or slumped over in a vacant room Head on a stranger's knee I'm sure back home they think I've lost my mind  Here I stand, sad and free I can't cry, I can't see What I've done Oh God, what have I done?"  -"Evaporated"  Yeah, my hair evaporated...lol.

      So I was wrong about the underground not happening this week...twice. Who cares.  IT'S SPRING BREAK!!!  WHOOHOO. It's about [expletive] time. Everyone needed a break.  Not a whole lot to recap on today, but oh well. Here it is anyhow: Science: Our group barely finished the lab on time today, thanks to Will and Kevin burning holes in our packets with heated forceps.  Spanish: "Bend it like Beckham" isn't such a great movie. I really like my cd player at moments like that. Isn't music one of the best inventions ever?  Study hall: Again, I resorted to music. And checking my email...hehe.  Social: Makenzie had her presentation today, we had several current events questions, blah blah blah. Except for the presentations, everything was routine.  I really didn't feel like going to choir today-and they still held it!! GRRR....on the day before break...they can't do that! PLUS, my sister's guinea pigs were taken home by some stupid little 6th grader when Mrs. Bartlet KNEW that I was going to take them over break. Meh, just hope they don't get killed.  I spent my Friday evening at a play. Yes, I go to plays for fun. lol. There were actually 2. The first one, titled "A Thousand Words" was the better one, in my opinion. Better acting, used a set, props, and wasn't as, peculiar, if you will, as the second one. Which was, by the way, titled "Crying Out". They both posed some of the problems and troubles people have every day, but I think the first one better represented them.  To quote Peter Sellers, "My eyes are beginning to feel tired."  Let me find a lyric here...hey-how about a double-shot of Five for Fighting, no?  "Baby there's something on my mind tonight  There's a reason to believe we almost got it right  There's a fire burning in the firelight  As we roll on tonight   There's paper promises and alibis  There is certainly uncertainty in all our eyes  But as long as you are here I'll be all right  As we roll on tonight   So you go out...I'll go on  If there's a doubt...we'll be strong  As we go on singing  One more for love my love  One more for love...   There's always blood to fill the heart betrayed  There are children being born to every house that's raised  And we're getting closer to where we got it made  As we roll on tonight   So you go out...I'll go on  If there's a doubt...we'll be strong  As we go on singing  One more for love my love  One more for love...   I'm never going to wait for anything  Never going to break for anything  Cause I am one more for love my love  One more for love  One more for love my love   Baby there's something on my mind tonight  There's a reason to believe that we got it right  And all and all you're all that's on my mind tonight As we roll on...   One more for love my love  One more for love"  -"One More for Love"  "Take off your shoes... Take off yourself  Take off your rented mental health  Take off your raincoat... settle down  Take off your nightmare and your frown  There is a place for you to go  To see another ringer in a rock show  Take my pretense for a time  Cause I want to say to you   I'm nobody without you...buddy  My long lost friend   If you're not here to hear me scream  Am I silent like a dream  Where all the dragons are my friends  Each night we meet our bitter ends  Do I need you to make me real  Like Wheeler spinning his own wheel  Quantum strings within my brain  Popping sanities insane   I'm nobody without you...buddy  My long lost friend   Not everybody has a brain  Not everybody's going sane  Not everybody wishes well  Not everybody's heaven's hell  Sometimes there's someone to blame  Sometimes a place for shame  Sometimes good's better than bad  Sometimes good's better than bad  Sometimes good's better than bad  Sometimes you're better than me   Heaven fell on herself tonight  As the devil met me in the wishing well  And in that moment I found myself knowing  That in the end it's just about you and me  Nothing smaller or larger  Though dragons are good for the soul  Nothing can be better than baring yourself for another...  Open for scrutiny, ridicule, and indulgence  Therein lies the balls, and the mind, and the heart...  As fear is truly the Mindkiller...  When nothing is left...  Everything is gained...  You see I wish I was a poet  But I know as we go round and round  Though endings are never ever happy  It's the happy moments along the way  That in the end  Make it...ok..."  -"Nobody"

       1 DAY UNTIL SPRING BREAK!!!!  WOOT WOOT! lol, now that's done. I am REALLY looking forward to break. God knows I need it.  I've got a few plans for the break, but I'll mention those later.  Recap: Math: WHOA!! That test was so damned easy... I think I actually passed! lol, I actually think I got a perfect on it. boy would that be nice.  Band: I actually got a solo on the opening blues today-that was fun. BASS OUT!  English: For the love of GOD, why do we have hour and a half PLUS 5 minutes of ENGLISH!!!! English is the devil... I now officially have 28 note cards.  With the start of spring break come my sister's two guinea pigs that are at school. That ought to be fun-last time I had them here, my dog took a crap in their bin...how lovely...  That's one of the things I'm not really looking forward too much, but they're kinda cool. The things I'm looking forward to, in chronological order: 1. (maybe) seeing the Cottage Grove Junior High spring plays Friday night 2. The Underground!!! I need to work on my pool shots... 3. Not doing any homework this Sunday. 4. Seeing "Secret Window" 5. Seeing "Ladykillers" with my sister 6. Watching LOTR (for all you good movie illiterate people, LOTR=lord of the rings) with Amanda. 7. Arrival of my Grandparents. 8. The Underground!!! for a second time, if I'm not doing something else with my nightlife... i.e. playing "greedy" with my grandpa lol. 9. Not having to wake up terribly early for a week. 10. Looking forward to some quality time off to do what I want to without my parents on my back all the time.  Yep, Spring Break is almost here!!! God knows we ALL need it...

       ONLY 2 MORE DAYS UNTIL SPRING BREAK! Plus it's St. Patrick's day. Oh yeah, I forgot to put this in my profile...I will soon. I'm 1/4 Irish.  I never thought I'd get this far this quick with those stupid notecards...I have 19 when I came home with 6 today. When I woke up this morning I had 0 done. Major cool  "Get on with it now!" Okok...here it is. rEcAp:  Math: I barely got done with my assignment in class, and problem 15 is kinda wierd. God I hate problem 9 or whatever it is...stupid airplane/wind angles and crap. Why don't we just leave those things to the computers that fly the jets 80% of the time anyway.  Science: Finish-my-math-and-do-science-assignment-while-not-watching-bacteria-video-hour.  Band: Same old stuff.  **Concert announcements** April 4th: The Random has a concert at Central Park at 2:00 in the afternoon. This does conflict with Chops drill camp, I believe.  April 13th: JAZZ COFFEEHOUSE!!! Its going to be awesome...so much jazz...lol. People need to absolutely pack the place.  April 20th (whoa, you have 3 concerts within 2 and a half weeks?! yes, we do): The MSA spring concert band concert, meaning the wind band, concert band, and wind ensemble.  Senior graduation: We played last year, and we're playing again. Same piece: Sine Nomine, one of my favorite band pieces...  On with the recap: Spanish: Not a whole lot of funnies from today, as we took a test today. Should be a few Friday, as it will be block day.  English: Random English Funny (wtf is going on here? a funny for every class?? no...just the classes that Matt Moris is in...lol): We had a substitute today (btw, Substitute is a good song by The Who). Mrs. Schenck to be precise. This allowed Matt to get away with saying "penis" instead of "present" during roll call. again. he is too good at that I swear!  Social: CE test today, which I got 57/60 on. not bad at all, considering I don't study much at all these days. I'm a crammer.  *this concludes the recap*  I added many cool new things to my profile today, such as more lyrics (don't I have enough of these already?! no.), an updated "self portrait in words", and a certain deterrant of sorts...  WE NEED CHAPERONES FOR THE LOCK-IN!!!!!!! NOW!!!!! We need one for 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM, 1 for 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM, and 1 for 2:00 AM to 8:00 AM. Please notify Sam, Carly, Pat, Jamie, Mikesh, or me within 24 hours of this posting. PLEASE.  I get so sick of hearing "20 dead in suicide bombing in...", "nearly 200 killed in train bombing...", "Building blown up, many expected dead..." these days. It makes me so damn sick to think about it. Every day, our soldiers are dying, citizens around the world are dying. People in SPAIN are dying because of terrorism, because of radical religious beliefs, because of the instability of international relations, because of our DUMBASS PRESIDENT!!!! *whew, got that out* Anyway, I feel like protesting because I'm sick of violence, of the whole "War in Iraq" and "Operation Iraqi Freedom" bull.  So here's a protest song to wrap it all up: "While digesting Reader's Digest In the back of a dirty book store, A plastic flag, with gum on the back, Fell out on the floor. Well, I picked it up and I ran outside Slapped on my window shield, And if I could see old Betsy Ross I tell her how good I feel.  But your flag decal won't get you Into Heaven any more. They're already overcrowded From your dirty little war. Now Jesus don't like killin' No matter what the reason's for, And your flag decal won't get you Into Heaven any more.  Well, I went to the bank this morning And the cashier he said to me, ";If you join the Christmas club We'll give you ten of them flags for free."; Well, I didn't mess around a bit I took her up on what he said. And I stuck them stickers all over my car And one on my wife's forehead.  But your flag decal won't get you Into Heaven any more. They're already overcrowded From your dirty little war. Now Jesus don't like killin' No matter what the reason's for, And your flag decal won't get you Into Heaven any more.  Well, I got my window shield so filled With flags I couldn't see. So, I ran the car upside a curb And right into a tree. By the time they got a doctor down I was already dead. And I'll never understand why the man Standing in the Pearly Gates said...  But your flag decal won't get you Into Heaven any more. We're already overcrowded From your dirty little war. Now Jesus don't like killin' No matter what the reason's for, And your flag decal won't get you Into Heaven any more."

      English just makes you want to scream bloody murder, I tell ya...Caitlin's poem about math kinda fits English right now. Mrs. Molin is a paper-waster...literally. Its a minimum of 30-5 source cards, 25 note cards, and you can't use the damn backs!! GRRR....PLUS the 25 are due on Thursday. I haven't started my notes yet, since my thesis is absolute crap. I know what I'll be working on tonight and tommorow night, that's for sure...  On to the daily recap: Math: I actually got AHEAD in my assignments today....wow. Science: labs...again Band: At least I'll have jazz day to get me through Thursday...english hell! an hour and a half!!! Spanish: I honestly don't have any random spanish funnies today, as I was allowed to save myself from watching Legally Blonde 2 and work on math instead (hehe...yeah I'm a nerd lol). English: ::makes sour face:: Social: Presentations will continue tommorow. We did a worksheet today...how interesting.  Random Social funny (another class has these?! yes...it does): This was a one-time thing, as Mr. Pullar subbed for Mr. Schoeberlein for a while. Anton stood up on a chair and danced while Matt danced around on the floor wearing a skirt...Either Pullar didn't notice, or (the more likely) he didn't want it to stop...(burn!)  We also had Pullar for English too....what a drag.  Today was the day of subs: a sub for English, Social, and a substitute bus driver.  I have to leave, but before I do, I will end with a footnote this time.  Footnote: I must thank Amanda for giving me permission to utilize the previous lyric (lol).

       ONLY 4 DAYS UNTIL SPRING BREAK!!!! Well, we have to deal with English for 4 more days....ugh! I greatly resent English currently, have I said that before? yes, I have. ANYWAY...  Tonight was the first orchestra rehearsal I've been to, and apparently the band is quite greatful for having me there. Yeah, orchestra has some cool things about it. I have some friends there, and the two things I love most: music, and Amanda. I had to "audition" today, which is odd since I'm the only percussionist around...  Let's see...recap: Math: eh...I'll work through whatever crap I've got tonight Science: woot-loads of labs Band: Same old, rehearsal for the concert coming up fairly soon. Spanish: Today, we have two-YES TWO-Random Spanish Funzies of the day. 1. During role call, Matt smoothly replaces "present" with "penis". This is right before lunch, so the whole class walks out laughing our heads off. Damn, Matt is too good at that. 2. Today was "Pi" day, you know, 3.14...anyway: We had pie at lunch, prompting Matt to excuse himself from the class after lunch, claiming he had "food poisoning". About 2 minutes later, Sam's cell phone rings in the classroom. Sustic never realizes that it was Matt calling from the bathroom...  English: GAAAA!!!!! I hate english!  Social: Presentations, and more presentations. that's all  That pretty much sums up the day, and now I've got some homework, and practicing the two instruments I play best...lol. Plus I'm getting tired, which implies that I need sleep. And talking about being tired gets me even more sleepy. uh oh. I gotta run  I'll leave you all with yet another lyric, this one by Michelle Branch.  "When you're all alone, and you need a light, someone to guide you through the night, just remember that I am here, to hold you close and dry your tears.   Oh-ooh   And just when you thought you were falling, but you know I'll always be right there.   When you're all alone, and you need a friend, someone to help you to the end, when you need someone to catch you when you fall, I'll be there through it all.   oh-oh   Cause just when you thought you were losing, but you know I'll always be right there.   And I'll be there through the good times, and the bad, and we'll be there for each other, cause you're the best friend I've ever had.   And just when you thought you were falling, but you know I'll always be right there. oh-oooh whenever you need me, I'll always be right there."

      Now that is what Saturday nights should be like...lol.  Recap of the day: Woke up at 8:30, left at 9:30 for drum lesson at 10:00. Got home at 11:00. Played starcraft, ate lunch, and did homework to whittle away the time until the evening. Then...the underground!!! (that was the best time I've ever had there!)  A little odd timing issue: Nikki, Amanda, and I all left for the Underground right when Dylan and his family arrived for dinner. The three of us proceeded to arrive back when Dylan's family was leaving. wierd.  It's getting really late...I mean its 12:34-on-a-Sunday-morning late, and I have to rise bright and early for church. In other words, I gotta crash. lol.  Again, I'll leave you all with a lyric, this time from a Queen song.  "Oooh you make me live Whatever this world can give to me, It's you, you're all I see Oooh you make me live now honey, Oooh you make me live   Oh you're the best friend that I ever had,  I've been with you such a long time  You're my sunshine and I want you to know That my feelings are true, I really love you   Oh you're my best friend, Oooh you make me live  Oh I've been wandering round, but I still come back to you In rain or shine, you've stood by me girl  I'm happy at home, you're my best friend   Oooh you make me live  Whenever this world is cruel to me, I got you to help me forgive Oooh you make me live now honey, Oooh you make me live   You're the first one, when things turn out bad  You know I'll never be lonely, you're my only one  And I love the things, I really love the things that you do You're my best friend, Oooh you make me live  I'm happy at home, You're my best friend  Oh you're my best friend, Oooh you make me live  You're my best friend"

      I'm attempting to blog with blue/purple hands that are probably as cold as ice to someone else...not fun. Sometimes they get so cold they tingle-my room's got 2 outside walls, my house is 124 years old, uninsulated, and Victorian. What fun.  Anyway, the prospect for this weekend isn't looking two great. I've got tons of stuff that I have to do, with only 1 really good/fun thing, but it's enough to get me through my english project, math that I don't really understand as much as I would want to, spanish, science, and social. Yeah, it's got something to do with these three things: Saturday evening, Underground, and Amanda. lol  ReCaP:  Science: Again, I was pulled away from class by the call of music (band). But hey-I'm a band freak, nerd, or any other name for someone who's in possibly too many bands. That's what you get, and I like it. Today's lab used: bunsen burners, and E. Coli bacteria. We did gram-staining stuff. The funny moment from this: Matt held his slide in the flame for about 5 seconds. The glass half melted, half shattered into several pieces. That's exactly why you pass the slide through the flame...isn't it?  Spanish: Yes, the RaNdOm SpAnIsH fUnNy Of ThE dAy is back! Here it is: Sam, Matt, Pat, Anton, and I all planned this "fiesta" for today, which we claimed Mrs. Sustic had planned. She hadn't, but we brought a toaster, jelly, peanut butter, bread, cookies, and chips. Our little 5 minute break turned into 15 minutes.  Yet another: With another round of the "Vamos a comer?" routine, we convinced Mrs. Sustic that we were to go to lunch at the same time we always do on non block days, except it was an hour earlier. I think someone told Mrs. Sustic that it was block day though...grr...  Social: I will now expand upon the statement of last night's post. A few nights ago, my year-old computer's burner drive stopped burning, and the floppy drive was acting up last night too. This meant that I couldn't put my social project onto any type of transportation...except email. It took a goodly amount of time to attach the damned thing, which I had to break into 3 files and send 3 separate emails with 1 per email. I was up until about 10:40 last night, steaming at my computer, talking on AIM, and trying to figure out how to get my project ready. As it turned out, I was able to collate it during study hall today. Thank God for study hall, and thank God for me having social 6th period...I also happened to be the first presenter, simply because I had Michelangelo, the all-important Renaissance artist. And apparently I'm going to make everyone else with powerpoint presentations look bad because I had 13 slides, plenty of information, and I was able to add extra information by memory. I guess it just comes from my good composure in speaking to a group...  As for Thursday:  English: UGH! This stupid project now includes making tons of notecards. I greatly look forward to taking all these damned notes and documenting them over the weekend...  Band: Running through the songs for our concerts that are coming up pretty soon has become pretty routine, with the exception of Jazz day of course. I swear, I never get to solo on the piano during the warm-up blues thing at the start...NEVER! It really erks me...  Math: We're learning about Vectors (not Victors....lol Kellen) in chapter 10. Plus, there's some of it I really don't like. Such as problem 3, chapter 10, section 3. I spent the whole f@#$ing hour doing that one...it erks me (lol, people should use that word more).  Well, that pretty much sums up the school part of yesterday and today.  New addition to Fridays after choir: 1/2 hour drum lessons (yes, I teach AND take drum lessons now) with Ajay. Only 10 bucks for a half hour. I need more students! (because I'm 400 dollars in debt!!)  Hopefully I can make something of tonight other than doing homework...like I ever do homework on Fridays...ha!  To close, I'll supply you all with lyrics from a song I've grown to like over the past few days. And NO, its NOT a COLDPLAY song...lol. I like most of their stuff, and I know just about all of their stuff, so there's not much to discover.  "I’m not alone cause the TV’s on yeah. I’m not crazy cause I take the right pills everyday. And rest, clean your conscious, clear your thoughts with speyside with your grain. Clean your conscious, clear your thoughts with speyside. Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt. Our hearts littering the topsoil. Tune in and we can get the last call. Our lives, our coal. Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt. Our hearts littering the topsoil. Sign up it's the picket line or the parade. Our lives. I’m not alone cause the TV’s on yeah. I’m not crazy cause I take the right pills everyday. And rest, clean your conscious, clear your thoughts with speyside with your grain. Clean your conscious, clear your thoughts with speyside.  Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt. Our hearts littering the topsoil. Tune in and we can get the last call. Our lives, our coal. Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt. Our hearts littering the topsoil. Sign up it's the picket line or the parade, our lives. (I bled the) greed from my arm. Won’t they give it a rest now? Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt. Our hearts littering the topsoil. Tune in and we can get the last call. Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt, our hearts littering the topsoil. Sign up it's the picket line or the parade."  --"Bleed American", Jimmy Eat World.

      I just wish this kind of weather would go sulk in a dark corner somewhere, geez. We don't need rain, I don't want snow anymore since spring break is just over a week away, and it's still too cold for biking long distance. damn March always sucks.  Well, its about time some sunlight showed itself. Even yet, I spent a good amount of time in the library today checking out a slew of books. Last night I tried, but the library closed at 8:30 instead of 9:00. stupid budget cuts! you can all blame good ol' Pawlenty for that. As for homework: English, English, oh-and English. Yep. Thank you Mrs. Molin.  As fate has it, I will not be going to the JSS this Saturday. I would probably get my ass beat because my deck isn't completed, namely glimmervoids. Wouldn't have worked anyways-I've got a drum lesson that morning.  Haven't talked about music in a while, so here's some new stuff: "The Blues", Eric Clapton "Wander this World", Johnny Lang "Jimmy Eat World", Jimmy Eat World  Granted, it's not new, but its new from my collection. In other words, I ripped off the library...lol.  I resent English greatly...

      Its been 4 days, and there's still not a whole lot to say, well, things that I want to say here ::wink::  Anyways, so Friday was really awesome, since it was a snowday and all. Kind of funny how we didn't get a whole lot, and the last time we had snow-somewhere around 1.5 feet-we didn't get school off. I guess a ton of people complained to Washington County. That'll show the idiots.  Saturday: Hmmm...lets see. Nothing during the day really mattered, but that night I joined the Woodbury Youth Orchestra (!!!). Apparently they needed a drummer rather badly, and I had been thinking about it for a while.  Sunday: This was go-to-church-and-get-home-to-do-homework day. Again. Not a whole lot goin' on on Sundays.  Monday: The English project seems to be getting bigger, and yet, less daunting at the same time. 4-6 pages isn't bad at all, and I've narrowed down my topics to just a few. The totally FREE concert was pretty dang good too. I went to the US Marine Corp Battle Color Detachment concert at the Xcel center. The bands were excellent, the precision rifle drill squads were most impressive, and the video clip "Iraqi Freedom: Chapter II" did not belong at all, especially when Bush's voice showed up in it. What can you do? This kind of thing attracts a lot of conservatives, but I went for the music. Oh yeah, and I could not find ANYONE I knew there...grrr...so I ended up with my own little private 3-seat row. Obviously the best seats were in front of the band, and were occupied by people like Pawlenty, Klein (f**$). What can I say-conservatives like this ra-ra America, free Iraq hooha. At some point, I think that the situation in Iraq is going to blow up and violence is going to run rampant. Not every kind of people there like the Constitution being put into place, such as the Kurds. So one ethnic group is getting angry at the other because of their Constitutional rights. Its sad, but it may take an extremely bad situation in Iraq where higher amounts of soldiers die, in order to get all these idiots to wake up and see what the f@#% is going on.  As for today, I'm spending the evening holed up in my local library working on English.

      This snow isn't as bad as it seems-at least I'm getting paid to bust my back shoveling all this crap. It's also good excercise, so I'm not passing on that oportunity-especially with the racing season coming up pretty quick. I already got 10 bucks from the neighbor lady for helping her out-I've been doing it for free for a while, so I think it was good to get paid. Now for my driveway, sidewalks, stairs, etc. etc. etc.  What a coincidence-a snow day on a Friday, which happens to be the day after the best night of my life-all 15 years. How could it get any better...?  It doesn't seem too bad outside for a bike, so today I'll be going places. yay! Well, it's a damned fine day-10 bucks in the wallet (lol) and more coming, a day without homework, and it's the weekend. And that means seeing friends. Woot! Oddly enough, with me not sleeping too well last night-I kept waking up all the time, I feel quite energized. I hope it doesn't end.

      So lent’s started, and Passion of the Christ has caused a huge, and unnecessary uproar. As for lent, I haven’t given up anything. I don’t believe in the idea of giving something up for lent as self-sacrifice. Instead, I think that people should give up their time (well, maybe do give something up…lol) to serve and help other people. You give up something to better yourself, right? So then give up your time and energy to do something good, which inherently makes you a better person, and it helps out others too to make them feel better during lent. That’s my theory, so critique me if you’d like. On another religious note, my feelings on The Passion of the Christ: agh!!!! Sure, the evangelicals (who happen to be crazed conservatives) praise its graphic representation of “how it was” for Jesus on the cross, crucifixion, etc. This movie has way too much f%^&ing hype and publicity for what it offers. I myself have not seen it, and I don’t plan to. Ever. Instead of showing the violence and hatred of the time, why not show all of the good things Jesus did? This is just another reason why I don’t particularly like Mel Gibson, along with the Lethal Weapon series. He’s a violence-loving conservative bastard. lol  Moving along ::cough:: ENGLISH SUCKS!!! Well, maybe not so bad, but this project sure seems daunting. I mean, nearly 300 points in about 1 month, tons of work, and the topic isn’t necessarily interesting. Even yet, I managed to write over 200 words on “what it means to be a Murphy” today…lol. Then there’s that social project, which shouldn’t be so bad since we have tons of class time. Over all, the class I dislike most right now is English. Have fun with vectors in pre-calc  The biking season’s closer than I thought-I already have an indoor training session this Saturday. DAMN this snowstorm! It can’t be spring with 7 damned inches of wet, heavy, sloppy snow on the ground, with me shoveling it all away. No, I don’t have a snowblower. Not that we really need them a whole lot, thanks to global warming…and when snow comes, people are up in arms about it.  Thank you, Mr. Bush, for your immense efforts on industry emissions control. You have really helped fuck up our air, and you still deny the existence of global warming. In fact, you try to cover up and eliminate all of the scientific FACTS that point towards global warming. I want to thank you again, Mr. President, on your efforts to weaken the United States Economy and drop the whole damned country into 500 billion dollar budget deficit. And also, thank you for cutting the taxes of fat, rich company-owning bastards all over the country and backstabbing middle and lower-class citizens. It’s really helped eliminate the huge poverty gap. Despite all these wonderful tax cuts, you took the country into Iraq for no real need, except for all that oil that a Texas oilman like you can’t resist. And now the country is stuck between Iraq and a hard place. Thank you, again, for stealing the 2000 election and screwing over the United States of America.  A good book to read: Red, White, and Liberal, by Alan Colmes. He happens to be the host of a news show on Fox news network, which is by coincidence, the most utterly idiotic and disgustingly conservative TV network.

      My two posts on Saturday make up for the deficit of two days, well, maybe. Not having school today just gave me another day to procrastinate on my homework, some of which I have not done as of yet. Namely mi espanol (damn computer won't do spanish characters).  Review of weekend: Overall, a pretty good weekend because of the extra day, but kind of a boring, stuck-inside-the-house-because-it's-raining weekend. Except for Amanda's party, of course. That was great! Grrr...I should have played piano there.  A few moments from the party: 1. Hannah Lagoon stands outside barefoot in the snow for 30 seconds, thus receiving 25 cents from me. 2. Multiple people try to drag me into the room with the piano (I didn't have my music). 3. Again, multiple people (not including myself) get high off of pure sugar, and, of course, caffeinated soda. 4. When I had just got there, I was barely paying attention to anything, and thus, lost crucial parts of conversations.lol 5. When Amanda realized that the face of Lincoln on my 5-dollar bill was replaced with the face of a cow. Seemed like the theme of gifts was cows...  Ack, I have to keep reading Stardust. I haven't really gotten going yet. Oh, and by the way, American Gods is a good read.  The New Five for Fighting album, The Battle for Everything, is scheduled to be released this Tuesday. I plan to BUY it this time, and not wait for the library to get it and burn it. I've kinda stopped doing that now. I have too many blank cds floating around as it is.  Despite this weather, it's possible to ride a bike up to In Concert-at 7:30 at night, on a white road bike (that got covered with road shit). What fun.  I never thought I'd get it done, but the English play review is finished as of this afternoon. Thank god for 4 day weeks. And we still get study halls! wootwoot. hmm....what to do next weekend...

      I was sooooo incredibly busy tonight. I mean crazy busy. Here: 1. Walked the dogs. 2. Avoided homework. 3. Did not have a drum lesson, because of the traffic my mom was stuck in. 4. Mowed Steve Hunsted's lawn across the street, gained 15 bucks. 5. Mowed the lawn of 643 Summit Ave. 6. Picked up the drumset from school, and found that the Redrock Swing Band wasn't done rehearsing yet. We waited for about 10 minutes, then took the set away from them. 7. Tried to mix in dinner sometime. 8. Got the food for the party tommorow night.  That brings me up to now, which is pretty late. I still need to take a shower, pack a lunch, eat a sandwhich because I didn't have any dinner, and go to bed at like 11. Then tommorow I'm going to be absolutely exhausted after everything...

      I'm currently working on some response for part 2 of Fahrenheit 451, and its funny because Mrs. Molin can't see me blogging on this laptop in the very front of the room. hehehe. Anyway...  Yesterday: I don't remember much about the school day, which probably sucked anyway, and in the famous words of Dylan Curzon "daily incidents at school are not valuable to a blog, as you either don't give a f*ck, or you go to my school, or a combination of the two". Ok, so maybe Dylan didn't say all of that, but its pretty close.  After school I went to the Y and played pool. I don't know, but its just like the physics and movement of the balls, all the angles and shots, force, etc. Yeah, its the physics. One of my favourite (whoohoo! alternate spelling) games...even though I kinda suck at it. Well, sort of. I purposefully get 2 and 3 balls in on 1 shot sometimes, but I'm not that great.  My sister came over to visit yesterday (she's 21), and I routed her 2 out of 3 games in Speed Scrabble. Its like scrabble, only without a board, and the first person to finish a cross-word wins. Here's how it goes:  1. Each player picks 7 tiles. 2. You attempt to make words that build off of your other words (each player has a separate cross-word so they don't cross). 3. Whenever you use up your current letters (all the letters you had are in the words), you say "take 2". Then each player must take 2 more letter tiles, and either add on if you can, or trash a section or the whole puzzle and start over in order to fit the letters in.  This game goes really fast, as in there was a stretch when ever 5 seconds or less I'd say "take 2". Its pretty damn tough to catch up unless your opponent gets stuck and can't do anything. Then you can take a breather until you finish your letters and call up 2 more tiles. Its a really good game, but you have to be good at scrabble to play well. I've beaten both my sister and my dad a few times in scrabble, so I guess I'm pretty good.  Yesterday was a day of loss and gain. Sounds like business, eh? Yep. I lost 2 customers already this year for lawn mowing, potentially 3, but I gained 2 so far. My nextdoor neighbor agreed to have me mow their lawn. Apparently the other kids who did her lawn the other year were 12 years old and couldn't push a mower without being afraid of it. wtf? I was mowing lawns as a business when I was 12.  Dammit! I don't get to go play pool today at the Y because my mom can't pick me up later. I wonder what's going to happen with the drumset which we need to pick up from the school for tommorow night's concert. There's also 2 more covers for the bassdrum front for the RANDOM. I think that we're going to switch them every 10 minutes or so to be more random.  There's only 5 minutes left of class, so yeah, I gotta go.

      Don't you hate the Iowa tests, a.k.a. the ITED's? And don't you hate it when you get home off the bus and there's a pile of dog diarrhea right near the door? Yeah, not fun.  Plus a few other things that made the past few days below average: 1. I got a 26/40 on a math test (that's a D), which I had never done before. It dropped my grade quite a bit, and I don't know if we're even having a damned final. 2. My parents got pissed at me last night for not practicing instruments for a few days. grrrr...and then I have a piano lesson tonight. I always seem to manage to pull off accomplishing a ton with only a few practices. 3. I didn't do my english homework last night, so I spent today's class time reading. 4. I have a piano lesson tonight, which I'm not really looking forward to.  Plus, this Friday's concert is the final concert for The RANDOM. Tommorow is our last practice of the year too. *tear* yeah...kinda sad. I already did paint a piece of posterboard for the bass drum at the MOA concert, and Craig's working on the letter design. Should be kinda 60's-70's looking.  eh, its either walk the dogs, or clean up the dog shit, so I'm gonna go walk the dogs.  And by the way, Iowa sucks. Its just a piece of crappy flat land with stupid people that came up with the Iowa tests.

      Ever been so tired you can't do anything except lay down and wish you were sleeping? Yep, that's how I feel right this damn minute.  Fact: you can become very groggy from oversleeping. I discovered this is quite true by sleeping 11 hours last night. I would have slept longer had I not been required to get up because of some stupid bike practice.  Speaking of the bike practice: 1. The coach was almost 1/2 hour late, and didn't say "sorry I fucked up and delayed the ride", nor did he say anything that included the words "I'm sorry" and "late". 2. The ride was painful. Painfully short that is. I wanted to go faster than a leisurely pace, and longer than about an hour. The reason (no, I'm not talking about the new Hoobastank album) was, "some of our riders were tired from racing yesterday." I've had to race and then ride the next day, so get over it! 3. There was a potluck. There was lots of food. I ate too much, with nothing else said. 4. I think I may be switching teams, because I'm so f@#%ing sick of poor organization, or the lack thereof. I hate starting the season late. I hate missing season opener races, which results from the late starts, which results from the shitty organization. Everything the coach says turns into a pile of "no development team...will be development team...sort of...comp team only practices, but others invited..." W.T.F? 5. The coaches lost everyone's orders of jerseys and shorts, so everyone has to pay again. WTF?!? 6. I don't really know anyone on the team. No one to talk to, really. And we all know how terribly anti-social I am...  So this is what 11 hours of sleep plus unorganized bike team coaches can do to you huh? Turn you into a pessimistic asshole, thats what. Well, more like excedingly annoyed and angry. Maybe I can switch to Andrew Kotz's team. Then I actually know somebody that I used to race with. And I hope to God that team's more organized than mine.  Oh yeah, and now I'll close with the lyrics of something I wrote today: fuck lyrics in blogs for today. lol, no lyrics today. If you want to know a song I like, I'll give you song A by band B, nothing else said.  A=The Reason B=Hoobastank  Like I said, nothing else said. Oh, and you're welcome Dylan and Amelia.

      Just a few things that I wasn't able to put in my other entry, as they hadn't happened yet.  1. I spent about 3 hours or so cleaning my porch. Which, by the way, had horrendously dirty red old carpet, complete with a coat of mouse droppings along every wall and behind every shelf, and lots and lots of dirt. And yes, my away message today was "I like dirt".  2. I did get the opportunity of going to the Underground tonight, and you know, I have to consider it a highlight of any given week. I watched part of Cheaper by the Dozen, shot pool surprisingly well tonight, attempted to play wall-ball (but I kept throwing it too hard, and no one else would play dammit). Then Buddy and Dan tried to cart off my bike. Nevermind the fact that my bike is worth more than Dan...lol. Yeah, but its always fun, especially when Amanda's there too.  3. I did get absolutely soaked on the way home, but no Amanda, I didn't kill myself. is that a good thing?  4. About the entry title...I was rappin' in da hood with my g-dawg Will. yeah...we came up with some really crazy stuff. I don't really care to give an exerpt...  Hm....how about I mix Will's blog with mine and put in a Led Zeppelin song? hm?  "Queen of Light took her bow, And then she turned to go,  The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom, And walked the night alone.   Oh, dance in the dark of night, Sing to the morning light.  The dark Lord rides in force tonight, And time will tell us all.   Oh, throw down your plow and hoe, Rest not to lock your homes.   Side by side we wait the might of the darkest of them all.   I hear the horses' thunder down in the valley blow,  I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon, waiting for the eastern glow.   The apples of the valley hold, The seeds of happiness,  The ground is rich from tender care, Repay, do not forget, no, no.  Dance in the dark of night, sing to the morning light.   The apples turn to brown and black, The tyrant's face is red.   Oh the war is common cry, Pick up you swords and fly.  The sky is filled with good and bad that mortals never know.   Oh, well, the night is long the beads of time pass slow,  Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow.   The pain of war cannot exceed the woe of aftermath,  The drums will shake the castle wall, the ring wraiths ride in black, Ride on.   Sing as you raise your bow, shoot straighter than before.  No comfort has the fire at night that lights the face so cold.   Oh dance in the dark of night, Sing to the morning light.  The magic runes are writ in gold to bring the balance back. Bring it back.   At last the sun is shining, The clouds of blue roll by,  With flames from the dragon of darkness, the sunlight blinds his eyes."  -"The Battle of Evermore"

      Yep, tommorow's the day I find out how bad I am at biking at the start of this year...and how much I neglected to train over the winter. My bad.  Sorry for not blogging yesterday-I was absolutely beat after this week. Orchestra, 2 concerts, staying up late with homework and crap, jazz band, carting around the school's drum set several times, working on bikes too late at night, and yeah. I was tired as hell.  Thursday latenight: I stayed up until past 11 working on installing a computer on my bikes, checking the tire pressures, maintenance, etc. Got to bed at midnight.  Friday:  Science: survived making a model of a flower out of random junk  Spanish: survived the test with a B  Study hall: worked on that stupid flower model  Social: Took some notes, almost fell asleep  After school:  Choir-almost fell asleep again  After choir, I ran into Amanda on her way to her first real trumpet lesson (the kind you pay for). Took a trip to an ATM nearby to get cash to pay for my "Imaginary Invalid" t-shirt, and bought a well-needed Frapuccino (those are sooo good). I should try drinking coffee more often.  Beyond that, I tried to decide what to do with my evening, and during the process ended up biking around SPP with Dylan, Buddy, and Bill (I think that's who it was), and wound up at Dylan's place. It sure is fun sprinting up Pullman Hill on a bike as fast as the cars. Tiring, but fun when you get a few looks.  I stayed up too late...again. Conan was a re-run, so I don't really know why I stayed up to watch an episode of 3rd Rock from the Sun and eat some pretzels. Either way, I had to get up at 8:30 this morning and go to a drum lesson at 10:00. Already mowed some of the lawn last night, some today, and I still have chores, homework, and stuff to do.  Tonight: I might go to the underground, so if you want to break into my room and ransack the place, then'd be the time to do it. lol. If I don't go, idk what I'll do. It might just be yet another weekend nightlife w/o the life in it.  Oh, plus I watched Super Troopers last night. It was, to say the least, chucklingly entertaining...lol. Kind of a dirty movie though.  I'll just feature the song that's on the radio right now-one of the alltime classics.  "We all came out to Montreux On the Lake Geneva shoreline To make records with a mobile We didn't have much time Frank Zappa and the Mothers Were at the best place around But some stupid with a flare gun Burned the place to the ground Smoke on the water, fire in the sky  They burned down the gambling house It died with an awful sound Funky Claude was running in and out Pulling kids out the ground When it all was over We had to find another place But Swiss time was running out It seemed that we would lose the race Smoke on the water, fire in the sky  We ended up at the Grand Hotel It was empty cold and bare But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside Making our music there With a few red lights and a few old beds We make a place to sweat No matter what we get out of this I know we'll never forget Smoke on the water, fire in the sky Smoke on the water"  -"Smoke on the Water", Deep Purple

      I attended the public meeting on the expansion of the arts and humanities department of MSA tonight, which was more interesting that I had thought. Although, I have to admit, its quite a deal more interesting when you're the more vocal type in these kinds of meetings-not for the faint of heart, really. The Great Hall wasn't packed, but there were enough people to make the average person feel a little out of place.  Anyhow, I think I spoke for the majority, if not all of MSA's music department members on this: 1. There is a vast amount of interest in expanding the music department of MSA, as it is a very much alive program and continues to grow every year. 2. Each year more people join the band/music program at MSA, and we need more space. 3. On the lack of space issue...I vouched for a more complete percussion section. That includes marimba (Hana says we need one, so that means we get one), a set of 4 timpani, and a full-concert grand piano *salivates*. Damn would I love to have one of those... 4. I also felt that I spoke again for the whole music department at MSA in sayin that a new auditorium would GREATLY improve the sound qualities of our bands. The accoustics in the Great Hall are horrendous, and a new auditorium with sound panels and accoustically sound design would really improve the program, attract more students towards that program, and even attract more students into MSA itself.  To reiterate in a few words: it'd help the sound. Dan Menssen gave a little speech on the great interest of the 10th grade, mainly the english class, and about the details of having/not wanting to have to chose arts and humanities OR math and science. I'm a little wary on having to make that choice too, however. I'm very much so interested in the music department, and they need me. Plus I like theater, and I plan to be in a few productions before I graduate from MSA. Even yet, I do well in math and science, and I need those classes to pursue my career as a mechanical engineer. That is, unless I end up as a full-time musician, which is very possible.  In other words, I gave a little speech too. I actually enjoy speaking to large numbers of people, oddly enough. And I haven't ever had any speech training-not even that stupid speech elective that I get to skip because of good ol' band.  Anyhow, that was my afterschool stuff.  As for the school day...:  Math: I think I tested fairly well on chapter 11. Then again, I'm usually a pretty good tester, and unlike some people I know (Saali), rarely study.  Band: ate food, drank diet Coke, finished Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and started Bruce Almight. I saw that one on opening night, and it just made me think even higher of Jim Carrey. I don't know how he can be so dang funny sometimes...  English: did crap, had a fire drill, ask Jamie.  Yeah...thats pretty much all for now. No lyrics this time, and I won't have time tonight to update Will's blog, so pester him to do it.

      I only have a few moments more to live...online that is. So here's today:  Math: stupid review  Band: watched Ferris Buehler's Day Off  English: the book Fahrenheit 451 is getting a bit better  After school: wanted to sleep, then the concert. It rocked, and we also determined something thats going to replace the lock-in that's not happening on the 30th. PARTY AT BREN'S!!!! Oh yeah....all RANDOM members are invited, must get invitation to come, not open to public. And if anyone wanted to know, I also bought 2 stems of Stargazer Lilies at the florist last night.  Well, I gotta go sleep-I've been so deprived the last few days, throw in a few concerts, playing the trumpet (I fasted for today), plenty of homework to keep me busy, etc. Oh, and my dad has no sense of aesthetics whatsoever-he got a brownish-purple rug for out living room. On top of that, its got a latex bottom, which is horrible for the wood floors. Geez...

      Its worse than last night. I don't think I'll be playing tommorow at all, not for one minute. I'm afraid that if I do, I'll end up cutting my lips and bleeding, which takes weeks to heal.  Anyway...here's today:  Math: I worked ahead last week, yet I still have a bit of homework tonight. How the f@#% did that happen?  Science: Great...another lab. And we still have a lab report to do. On another note, I somehow got into a conversation with Kacy, Will, Michelle, Kevin, and Kevin about sex and masturbation. Uh....yeah weird. It was kinda funny though, I admit.  Band: prepared for concert, need I say more?  Spanish: did a few quizzes in preparation for Thursday's test  English: Got to skip it because of band. Isn't music grand?  Social: see above  After school: took the bus home, ran an errand. To *drum roll* Cottage Grove Florist. I got a white rose boutonerre for the concert, and some other things...  The concert went pretty smoothly, except for the start. I was to open the concert with the second movement of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, but it was not to be without any technical difficulties. Firstly, I started playing. The damned power strip that supplied electicity to the percussion section was stuck under the pedals, so they couldn't be pressed. I stopped, and fixed the problem by kicking it out of the way. During this, the piano power plug-1 of 5, I might add-came out. Again, I had to fix the problem. What a joy...  Our last piece kicked major a$$. Berceuse and Finale was pretty dang good, considering I had never played quite that loud during the rehearsal, so I made a ton of people jump. But hey-if you're a percussionist playing loud rolls through that whole thing, and you're wearing a tux, you're going to get pretty hot.  After the concert was pretty fun too...except for the part when I had to load up the drum set for tommorow's concert (yes, there's another) in my station wagon out in the rain. Wasn't something to get jollies out of. I honestly did not know that Adam attempted suicide before, so thats one thing I learned. It also explained why he was out of school for 1.5 months.  I tried putting ice on my lips before (kissing ice...lol), but it didn't do a whole lot. I hate braces with a passion almost equal to my hatred of SUVs, but not quite. Braces suck!  Oh, and I did slip and fall today thanks to this damn rain, and I didn't get hurt at all, so here's some lyrics:  "Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing The way you came to my rescue Heaven must be watchin' over me  When the shadows fallin' and the day turns into night I hear my angel callin' and I can't wait to see the light Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing The way you came down to my rescue Heaven must be watchin' over me  Sometimes I get a feelin' like a fever comin' over me Just a touch of my angels hand and I'm right back on my feet  Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing The way you came down to my rescue Heaven must be watchin' over me  Stay with me baby. Come down from the sky Just like an angel. Take me to paradise  Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing The way you came down to my rescue Heaven must be watchin' over me"  -"Angel of Mercy", Johnny Lang

      Yeah...not too smart. Today's only the second time I've played trumpet, and I did for 45 minutes today. The first time was only 5 minutes. My lips are really tired, and I still can't hit the blasted tuning note!!!! GRRRR!!!!  Yeah, maybe I shouldn't expect so much out of myself on the second time, but hey-I need to work hard on it. And yes, the following quote is true.  "I don't believe you can do anything if you really want to, but I do believe you can play anything if you work hard enough." Right on, Jamie.  Maybe I should only practice for 15 minutes at first. I'll probably kill my lips and not be able to play for days, so I'll have to slow it down a bit. I do expect too much too fast...  Dammit. Trackstar is working again, so I have to go finish this crappy english webquest.  Today: NO SCHOOL!!!! hehehe I picked up a copy of a fingering chart and lip slurs from Jamie (thanks), did some homework, borrowed a trumpet from Amanda, and practiced for too long. Yeah...not a whole lot, but this week is going to be busy. Tommorow there's the MSA Spring concert. On Wednesday, there's the RANDOM concert at MCTC. Plus I'm going to be playing trumpet a ton this week, so music really is my life this week.  I'll features a song that Minnesota Brass did on Saturday night. By the way, they're phenominally good.  "Well, it's a marvelous night for a Moondance With the stars up above in your eyes A fantabulous night to make romance 'Neath the cover of October skies And all the leaves on the trees are falling To the sound of the breezes that blow And I'm trying to please to the calling Of your heart-strings that play soft and low And all the night's magic seems to whisper and hush And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush   Can I just have one a' more Moondance with you, my love Can I just make some more romance with a-you, my love   Well, I wanna make love to you tonight I can't wait 'til the morning has come And I know that the time is just right And straight into my arms you will run And when you come my heart will be waiting To make sure that you're never alone There and then all my dreams will come true, dear There and then I will make you my own And every time I touch you, you just tremble inside And I know how much you want me that you can't hide   Can I just have one a' more Moondance with you, my love Can I just make some more romance with a-you, my love   Well, it's a marvelous night for a Moondance With the stars up above in your eyes A fantabulous night to make romance 'Neath the cover of October skies And all the leaves on the trees are falling To the sound of the breezes that blow And I'm trying to please to the calling Of your heart-strings that play soft and low And all the night's magic seems to whisper and hush And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush    One more Moondance with you in the moonlight On a magic night La, la, la, la in the moonlight On a magic night Can't I just have one more dance with you my love"  -"Moondance", Van Morrison

      Yep. When I put a little thought into it, I realized that I can't play a horn yet, well, not really. Plus I have no experience marching. I would really suck in Chops. That's why I want to do Park marching band first, so I actually know what the heck I'm doing when I go to Chops drill camp. Yeah, so I'm biking for another year. whoohoo!  Speaking of biking...I went out today, and geez that wind is strong. I got up to probably 35 mph on Lincoln going with the wind, which happens to be flat ground. In highest gear, on Napolean (lol, my sister came up with that name for my white bike, so don't ask), with a cadence of like 100 rpms. It was great. Damn stop signs...yeah, they're fun to run too.  I really hope we get severe weather today. We need rain, and I love watching storms...especially when they hit the school. lol. Its getting hazy again, and this morning nothing happened. Stupid storms aren't forming. Oh yeah, and there's tornadoes north west and north east of here, and guess what? WE'RE NOT GETTING ANY!!!!! AND I CAN SEE THE STUPID STORM NORTH OF HERE!!!  Hm...what else did I do today: 1. Went to church 2. Road my bike around town a while, went to Buddy's house and Jamie's house, only to fine neither of them home. Continued on, and found Jamie and Becky up near Cottage Square Mall, and I they convinced me to start chops next year, and to do Park Marching Band this year. So next year I won't be the only rookie-Becky'll be one too...yay, I won't be the only idiot not knowing what they're doing. yeah, no homework, no chores, and no music yet. I'll save that stupid english web quest for tommorow.  I think I'll feature the song that Chops sang last night, and the weather's great today anyhow.  "I see trees of green, red roses too  I see them bloom for me and you  And I think to myself, what a wonderful world   I see skies of blue and clouds of white  The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night  And I think to myself, what a wonderful world   The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky  Are also on the faces of people going by  I see friends shakin' hands, sayin' "How do you do?"  They're really saying "I love you"   I hear babies cryin', I watch them grow  They'll learn much more than I'll ever know  And I think to myself, what a wonderful world  Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world   Oh yeah"  -Louis Armstrong.  Hehe, I can do a pretty good impersonation of him too...

      UGH!!!I went to the Chops/MN Brass/Goveneirs concert tonight, and now I really want to join chops next year or even this winter. Then I'd have to quit biking, or get a clone of myself to do it. grrr...  Eh, the only notable thing from yesterday that I missed was that I injured my knee playing football in biology. Yes, biology. Locking knees isn't fun. I couldn't extend my leg fully until last night.  Today: 1. Had a drum lesson 2. did chores 3. avoided homework 4. Chops concert  yeah, not a real action-packed day, but the concert was really fun. Ok, so maybe Chops wasn't quite as good as I thought they would be, but hey. MN Brass nearly blew my eardrums out...geez they're loud. I don't think they need any more mellophones.  More about music. I honestly think I have the ability to pick of most any instrument and learn to play it. Like the trumpet, or the saxophone, or the bari sax, or the mellophone, or the-whatever. I also find it nerve-racking to be a spectator to something you know you can be in, like Chops, and do well in it and have fun. Idk what I'd play-I might learn brass this summer, or maybe I'll get crazy-good on the snare or quads. But thats just it. That quote really has meaning: "Music is life. The rest is accidental." Yeah, music is my life, and I'm joining chops!!!

      Yep. ::sigh:: that describes my day. blah, kind of ordinary, kind of not, oh hell-I WANT THE WEEKEND!!!!!  No recap is needed, other than that I got ahead in my math (this time I've got one of those electric hand-carts (well, maybe not) and I'm ahead of the math train). Also we watched "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street", the Twilight Zone.  Hmm...what should I feature tonight...how about what the heck is on the walls/ceiling of my room? Its actually quite interesting:  I currently have ::counts:: 7 constellations on my walls and ceiling: Cassiopea, Orion, Big Dipper, Little Dipper, Leo, some giraffe-type thing, and Scorpio, which is my astronomical sign, right above my bed on the ceiling.  Posters: Some car posters, including a Plymoth Prowler, MINI Cooper (hehehe), Lamborghini Diablo, "Corvette Evolution", a black Lamborghini, and "Muscle Cars from the 60's". Two Baseball Pennants, The Yankees (yeah, I used to be a fan...) and of course, The TWINS. Some other posters, including The Matrix Reloaded movie poster, 3 weather/lightning scenes. Oh-btw...the MINI's above my headboard. lol.  K, enough about my room, because its not all that interesting, other than that I have a couch.  Why I'm looking forward to the weekend: 1. Friday night I'll be, well, I don't know what I'll be doing. Hopefully not stuck at home. 2. Shouldn't be a whole lot of homework, other than English....die english. 3. Saturday night I'm going to a chops concert!!!! Should be a ton of fun. Ya'll should go-its at Highland Park High, concert starts at 6. Fee is 5 dollars. Order by phone. CRAP!!! I haven't ordered mine yet!!! uh oh 4. Um, the rest I don't know what the heck I'm looking forward to.  Why I want next week to come: 1. I get Monday off. 2. Tuesday, there's the Spring Concert at MSA. Show starts at 7:00. I'm doing something a little different with my suit this time too... 3. Wednesday, there's the MCTC RANDOM concert, which promises to be pretty fun. Show starts at 7:30. 4. Thursday: I don't know 5. Friday: what's not to love about Fridays??  Ok, so I screwed up on the MOA concert date. Its the 30th, not the 23rd. Same night as the lock-in at MSA. MOA to MSA. lol. EVERYONE NEEDS TO COME TO BOTH OF THOSE. THAT'S AN ORDER!  I really wish I didn't have to go to choir tommorow. ugh. I don't like choir much-our songs are kinda crappy. Therefore, if I don't do something fun tommorow night (playing starcraft in my room at 9:00 PM doesn't constitute as "fun" on a Friday night-sorry Derrick), tommorow will be a Friday that doesn't deserve to be named Friday.  Eh, thats enough for today. I need to go-my time is up for tonight, and I need sleep. DESPERATELY. If I don't start getting 8 hours a night again soon I'm going to die.

      Ok, so that didn't work too well. lol, but it was really fun tonight. Not enough people came though, *cough, namely Buddy, Jessie, and Andy*. Well, ok, so I only know 1 of those people, but Jamie wanted them to come.  A few people that did show up (like everyone else should have done): Amanda Dylan Matt (from Chops) Sam Matt (Moris) Parents, and siblings of band members  It wasn't as packed as it could have been, but oh well. There's always the Spring Concert next week, the MCTC concert for the RANDOM next week, and the RANDOM at MOA next week!!!! *hint hint*  An answer to some of the people who ask me, "Are you in a band or something? Because you really should be."  Yes, I am in a band that plans to rehearse this summer, and should be quite good-we've actually got talented people, unlike other "garage" bands...  The no-name-yet band includes: Amanda Olson: lead guitarist, band leader, lyricist, lead singer Dylan: rhythm guitarist Will Grant: Bass Mitch Ogaard: Drums Brendan Murphy (me): pianist, back-up singer, composition Emily Olson: manager Editting *unverified*: Bryan Neilson  Now all we have to do is to get everyone in the same room at the same time, with or without the instruments. Preferably with.  As you can see, that whole band is pretty talented. Should be great-and maybe we'll be good enough to be the guest band at the next Jazz Coffeehouse. ZAM wasn't the most, erm, interesting band I've ever heard.  A small recap: Math: Woohoo! I jumped, blindfolded, and caught on to the "math train" again. I lost it for a day, but I found it. Crap. I still have homework that I'm not doing tonight.  Science: did an assignment  Band: threw Splanky out the window, prepared for the concert  Spanish: assignment  English: stuff  Social: stuff  Notice the quick recap-I have to go before my mom refuses to take me to the Chops concert!!!! Oh no!!  Yeah, I gotta run. No lyrics tonight, because I like what I used last night. And the night before, and the night before that...

      I snuck on (technically I'm not supposed to be online), so if I abrubtly end this, I'm trying not to get caught.  As for today:  Math: omg I hate it. I want to go into engineering, and I need to learn this stuff, but Mrs. Williams isn't the best helper for stuff. Damn parametric equations and conic sections and implicit sh*t.  Science: did assignment, attempted to work on math  Band: rehearsed some stuff for concert, attempted to work on math  Spanish: Did assignment, did not attempt to work on math, bought 2 posters at the book fair: -The Matrix Reloaded -MINI Cooper (!!!those are cool...) I plan to probably buy the American Muscle Cars from the 60's poster tommorow, or the Ferrari Enzo poster. Probably the former because its got multiple cars on it, kinda like my Corvette Evolution one. And Craig, I'm not selling it-sorry.  No funny from today, as 2 rows were switched, making it so Matt and Anton were separate from the rest of "us".  English: did crap, discussed "The Cold Equations"  Social: did stuff, I got a perfect on my test, what's new, blah, etc.  Anyway...there was this "ice cream anti-social" (lol) at the orchestra tonight. Wasn't too fun, as I didn't have any ice cream. Other than that, it was pretty much the same as all weeks-and no LOTR tonight. damn.  Lets explore why MSA is such a great place for finding someone to date. Note the sarcasm here. A few examples: -Jamie and Buddy, who goes to Oltman -Kacy and Ryan, who doesn't go to MSA -Michelle and Jeff, well, ok, but Jeff's switching out of MSA after this year -Jon, even though we can never determine which specific girls he's hanging out with every Friday night...lol -Will and Anysha, who lives in New Zealand (geez, man, find someone local!) -Sam and Carly are a rare pair, but Sam's most likely switching -And finally, Amanda and I, with her attending Cottage Grove Junior.  I swear, MSA is a very far cry from being  *whew!* almost got caught there...stupid mom knocked on the door and scared the crap out of me. If I do get caught, I can't go to the Chops concert! I know, I know, big risk, but I have to blog. lol.  As I was saying, you just don't have good odds at a school with 50 people in your class. In other words, there are downsides to MSA. It right as rain does pay to know people outside your school, if its MSA. grrrr....too small....  Well, I should probably get more sleep tonight than I did last night, seeing as that I didn't do my math tonight, and tommorow, ITS?!  *CONCERT UPDATE* Jazz Coffeehouse tommorow night at 7:00 PM! Everyone needs to go!!!! Lots of SPP people are going, so, yeah. Just go. It promises to be an awesome night of food and kick-a$$ music.  I like to use a large variety in my lyrics and bands here, so here's a band I haven't ever done before. Its kind of an odd band, but its a good song. Really.  "Whenever I’m alone with you you make me feel Like I am home again whenever I’m alone with You you make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I’m alone with you you make me feel Like I am young again whenever I’m alone with You you make me feel like I am fun again  However far away I will always love you however Long I stay I will always love you whatever Words I say I will always love you I will always Love you  Whenever I’m alone with you you make me feel Like I am free again whenever I’m alone with You you make me feel like I am clean again  However far away I will always love you however Long I stay I will always love you whatever Words I say I will always love you I will always Love you"  -"Lovesong", The Cure, covered by 311

      blogger didn't work last night, can't be on comp for another day (yeah right), will post again ASAP  A little applicable song:  "How many times have you heard someone say  "If I had his money, I could do things my way?"  Little they know that it's so hard to find  One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.   Once I was waitin' for fortune and fame  Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game  Suddenly it happened, I lost every dime  But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind   Money can't buy back your youth when you're old  Or a friend when you're lonely, or a love that's grown cold  The wealthiest person is a pauper at times  Compared to the man with a satisfied mind   When my life is ended, my time has run out  My trials and my loved ones, I'll leave them no doubt  But one thing's for certain, when it comes my time  I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind  I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind"  -"Satisfied Mind", don't have time to find writer

      I'm up at 12:45, blogging. What fun-I forgot to blog during the day, so I'm doing it now.  Now I'm sick, with a blasphemous (ok, maybe not) cold, complete with sore throat, random ear poppings, and stuffy nose. Needless to say, tea has been a good friend today...  Speaking of the day: -Woke up at 11:30, had Devonshire English Tea and cereal for breakfast, and "stared out the window". literally. That tea is good stuff though-plenty of caffeine. -Road bike to library somewhere around 3:30, and had fun running a red light in Cottage Grove...lol -Found out that Al's bike shop was closed today, as he was on vacation somewhere, so I couldn't get my wheels fixed. -Installed a bike computer. A real pain in the a$$, if I may say. -Had some stupid bland Italian dish for dinner-it wasn't pasta! How can it be Italian if it isn't some kind of pasta?! -Went absolutely nowhere during the evening, which was a good choice. Played Snood for a while, practiced piano/drums, watched SNL, drank yet even more tea (Chamomile with Valerian), and blogged. Geez, I think I have about 25 different kinds of tea here...  So yeah, thats about it. As for, well, later on today, as it is almost 1 in the morning, I'm attending the 10:45 Easter service at Zion Lutheran. As for the rest of the day, I'll try and shake this stupid cold.  Now the only thing I'm missing from my Englishman personality is scones...

      Yep, tis Good Friday today, which means we didn't have school. Yay!  The day's events: 1. Woke up too early, meaning 8:00, after getting to bed at 12:30. Wasn't too thrilled about that.  2. Did homework, so now I have nothing hanging over my head for the rest of the weekend.  3. Tuned up my Orbea road bike, so now its in semi-working order. I put eletrical tape on the handlebars instead of cushy handlebar tape to save weight (every gram counts in a race), checked the brakes, gears, raised the seat, ect. The only thing left that I can't do is to true the rear wheel-its pathetic.  4. Went on a little bike ride around St. Paul Park to random streets w/Dylan. We happened to see about 3-4 random idiot kids bashing Wal-mart brand guitars on the ground and basically making a racket in the park. idiots...and they wouldn't race against me. They'd get their asses kicked anyhow.  5. Decided not to do anything tonight, and spend Good Friday evening at home, relaxing. Watched Now, with Bill Moyers on PBS at 9:00, had a cup o' tea.  6. Thoroughly routed my father in a game of scrabble, 329-293, a quite sizable win.  7. Planning to watch Conan O'Brien, and yes, have another cup o' tea. Hmm...maybe I should get some scones. That's about the only thing I'm missing in my whole "Englishman" personality. Tea, London-Lingo, killer accent...  That's pretty much it, except the part of me sitting in my room listening to loud music. lol. Thank God my parents weren't home today.  And yes, my memory is leaving me for a better place, probably the Bahamas so it doesn't have to pay property tax on the business (erm...not funny). Yep, its early alzheimer's-my gray matter is already starting to decay. And yes, I did forget that there is no Underground this weekend. AGAIN! Despite desperate reminders and evening myself saying there isn't. What am I going to do when I'm 40?  So no Underground this weekend, as it is Easter Vigil. No Underground. No Underground. No Underground...so I might shoot pool play halo, or stay home because I have a stupid sore throat. Colds suck.  Oh. Amanda: I will be attending Zion Lutheran on Sunday, and yes, I'll be wearing a suit. lol.  Well, I'm off to go watch Conan. Better than Leno, better than Letterman, its Conan!

      Well, so what if Maundy Thursday isn't exactly a happy day, commemorating the Last Supper and the night before Jesus died. We're close enough to Easter, anyhow.  The day:  Math: homework check, no assignment  Science: finished lab, did assignment  Band: JAZZ DAY!!! And I got a solo on the opening blues!!! Whoohoo! Ok, so it wasn't quite that fun, but it was fun nonetheless. I love playing jazz...  Spanish: The half-hour stall on the usage of Formal and Informal tenses was amazing. I honestly didn't expect it to go on that long. Geez, I swear, Matt can get away with anything. We're working on the formal command form.  English: Continued the sci-fi unit, reading The Cold Equations. Quite a lame little story so far.  Social: Another deadline, well, not really, gone! The test breezed by as quick as something getting thrown out of a convertible on the highway. Ok, bad simile, but w/e. Considering I only studied for a total of about 5 minutes, I did exceedingly well with probably around 2 points out of 80 wrong.  After school: Drum lesson, and eating stuff. However, it was kinda fun out with the dogs. Pepper went bolting down the path, and it turned out we met up with Heather, Asher, and one of their friends. Then there was my really stupid dog and that leash...  Next to no homework this weekend, except for reading The Cold Equations. Shouldn't take that long.  Plans for this weekend: 1. Homework 2. Spending Friday evening at Friday Night Magic at Unicorn Games in Oakdale. 3. Chores 4. Biking, if the weather's good 5. Spending a ton of time on IM 6. Maybe the Underground again this week 7. Practicing music a lot-yeah...I'm a crazy musician...what do you want from me? 8. Not going to my church *gasp*, but I will probably be attending Zion Lutheran. Yeah, I know I'm Catholic, but I like trying out different churches and learning about different religions and stuff. If I can't go there, then I'll attend St. Thomas Aquinas. Either way, I'll get to wear a suit, which is always fun.  Plus with all those concerts coming up, I'll get to wear plenty of suits. Sure is fun looking sharp.  lol, anyway....  I also plan to work a bit on my magic decks, seeing as I haven't played much in a while. I did beat Gray 2 out of 2, well, I probably would have won the second game, at lunch today. My ponza is mediocre, and needs some work, but the mana curve is good.  Maybe I'll go shoot pool on Saturday or something. Yay for long weekends!

      Yeah, I only have a few minutes.  Quick sum-up of the day:  Math: working on parametric equations. Unlike some other people, math actually applies to me-I plan to be a mechanical engineer and make lots of money. Or....I can be a cool musician and not make lots of money.  Science: Worked on the lab because everyone, almost, was gone on the Spanish field trip.  Band: Still, everyone was gone. I went outside, attempted to work on my math homework, and ended up increasing my supply of paper wedges to about 30, along with many rubber-bands. lol.  Spanish: With Pullar as a sub, we couldn't pull a whole lot, so I ended up working, and finishing, my math homework during this hour.  English: Whoohoo!!! Another deadline whooshes by! There's a quote somewhere about that, but its already been used in Amelia's blog, so I won't. Plus, this english paper is about the only big thing thats happened recently, so I don't think I have that much of a right to use it.  Social: Test tommorow. Oh sh*t. Haven't studied at all! Eh, thats what Band, Spanish, and Science are all for, right??  Despues de escuela: Lets see...I had a really nice ride out on Napolean (my bike) today, with one hell of a Northwest wind. Must have been gusting up to like 40, and I had to ride straight into it. It did do one thing good though-propell me swiftly up Pullman hill-that was fun.  Other than that, I did the dishes, avoided cleaning up after my crippled canine, did homework for about 10 minutes, got gradesheets signed, and updated my blog. Other than that, not a whole lot new.  A few notable grades I got: Band: 100% (really easy) Biology: 82.6% or something. She still hasn't credited my for that stupid lab report on the primates...  There were others, but I don't care to remember them. No, I did not fail any classes, even though I know some of you wish it. lol.  I shouldn't be on right now, so I'm off, with no send off lyric, or quote. Sorry.

      God, I wish may-term were here. Only what, 4.5 more weeks? Yeah, thats about right.  English paper status: DONE!!!! All 9 pages of text, 2 pages of outline, 1 page of title, 1 page of works cited, and 1 page from the packet. 14 pages total of english crap, and supposedly/hopefully this paper rocks. Its called: "The History and Roots of American Jazz", quite a hefty topic.  Here's what happened today in school while I was wishing I was outside on the bike:  Math: We're doing parametric equations right now, if anyone knows what the hell that is. Its breaking normal equations into two parts, an X part and a Y part, both of which are functions of T after this transformation. weird.  Science: I got a 61/65 on the test. not too bad.  Band: blah blah blah, working towards the concert, what else is to say?  Spanish: Sustic got pissed, but I doubt she'll end up doing anything about that paper-wedge throwing the other day. As for the field trip tommorow to Boca Chica, I deemed it unworthy of my time and money, and purposely forgot the slip. My time is better spent avoiding having bio and math homework than eating a frickin Mexican buffet at 10:00 in the morning. I mean, what the hell are they going to serve, eggs w/jabanero peppers? french toast with rice and curry? I don't think so...  English: Paper's done! Paper's done! Now its time for that deadline to whoosh by! Need I say more?  Social: More current events crap, more notes, and more US soldiers dead in fucking Iraq. I'm so sick of hearing about that place...  And I won't go on a rant about the unjustness of the Iraqi war. Not now.  Instead of finishing up with a lyric, which Dylan deemed pointless (lol), I'll end with yet another quote of mine.  "Half the time in life when you think you're being rejected, you're really rejecting yourself."

      lol yeah, sorry for skipping a little. I need a break sometimes though, eh.  Weekend recap: absolute crap, except for Sunday.  Friday night: I stayed home.  Saturday night: I can't remember too well, but I think I stayed home.  Sunday: Didn't go to church on Palm Sunday *gasp* The concert was pretty good, although we were missing a few select members of the bad ::cough Jamie cough::. Yeah, and my second-half entry was great. lol  Worked on my paper a bit, did chores, and nothing else this weekend. Plus, this next weekend is Easter weekend, so I don't think I'll be doing a whole lot else other than going to church and homework. hehe like I do homework...  Recap of today:  Math: nearly fell asleep in class-so damn fricken tired...this is why I don't like daylight savings  Science: Test was fairly simple, I most likely passed...like I don't ever not pass?  Band: bleh, just played more crap for the concert.  A few concert reminders: EVERYONE MUST GO!!!!!  April 4th: Random played at central park  April 13th: Jazz Coffeehouse at MSA 7:00 PM  April 17th: CHOPS CONCERT!!!! Highland Park High, 6:00 PM  April 20th: Spring concert band concert 7:00 PM  April 21st: The RANDOM at Minneapolis Community and Technical College 7:00 PM  April 30th: The RANDOM at MOA!!!! Time is TBA. After the concert, MSA will be having a lock-in, which everyone needs to go to. Promises to be fun.  May 1st: Benefit concert for Central Park-they're getting a piano. MSA choir will be performing, starts at 8:00 PM.  May 15th: Woodbury Youth Orchestra concert, time TBA as soon as I find out.  May 23rd: Woodbury Youth Orchestra concert, time TBA. Note: I will also be playing piano at both large masses at Saint Joan of Arch (my church) that Sunday.  Those are all of the concerts I can think of, so yeah-this spring's a doosie.  Spanish: Geez, I think we're really getting on Mrs. Sustic's nerves. During the evaluation of the maps, people kept launching paper rolls around.  Random spanish funny: At the very beginning of class, an unnamed student (lol) propped up 1 of the desks against the door, leaning forward. So when Mrs. Sustic shut the door, the desk fell over.  English: I foresee my paper being 8 pages long...plus 2 page outline...plus 1 page works cited...plus title page UGH!!! 12 pages of junk  Social: Finished up the presentations today with Cal's on Florence, Italy. Test on thursday is going to be a joy.  That concludes the recap.  As for after school today...this weather is awesome. Orchestra tonight, I usually look forward to anything involving music. Even if it is incredibly easy, but hey-I get to play the chimes, which is pretty cool.  Hmm....lets see...  Here's a summery song because its 71 degrees out.  "Blue skies smilin' at me Nothin' but blue skies do I see Bluebirds singin' a song Nothin' but bluebirds all day long  Never saw the sun shinin' so bright Never saw things goin' so right Noticing the days hurrying by When you're in love, my how they fly  Blue days, all of them gone Nothin' but blue skies from now on (Blue skies smilin' at me Nothin' but blue skies do I see)  Never saw the sun shinin' so bright Never saw things goin' so right Noticing the days hurrying by When you're in love, my how they fly  Blue days, all of them gone Nothin' but blue skies from now on Nothin' but blue skies from now on"  -"Blue Skies", Willie Nelson

      I'll make this pretty quick, as I want/need to get out on Napolean (my Trek bike). This weather rocks!  Hasty recap:  Biology: another webquest  Spanish: OMG TODAY WAS HILARIOUS!!!! There's soo many funnies from today...but I'll put in the best.  RaNdOm SpAnIsH fUnNy: Mrs. Sustic isn't the most observant teacher, apparently...as Matt got away with talking really loud, saying strings of the following words to Anton: "You motherf*cking c*nt, b*tchwh*re, shut the f*ck up." Sustic was only 7 feet away, and he got away with it (!?!).  Social: Same-old, I missed a few points on the test, bleh bleh.  A few musical notes: Relient K-the band that's going to be added to my fav band list soon. Jimmy Eat World-their album rocks! people should check it out. Bleed American is probably one of the best, if not the best song on there, but I'll close with a double-shot.  "There's no one in town I know You gave us some place to go. I never said thank you for that. I thought I might get one more chance. What would you think of me now, so lucky, so strong, so proud? I never said thank you for that, now I'll never have a chance. May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads the sleepless go. May angels lead you in. So what would you think of me now, so lucky, so strong, so proud? I never said thank you for that, now I'll never have a chance. May angels lead you in.  Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads the sleepless go. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in. And if you were with me tonight, I'd sing to you just one more time. A song for a heart so big, god wouldn't let it live. May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads the sleepless go. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads the sleepless go. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in."  -"Hear you me"  "Hey, don't write yourself off yet. It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on. Just try your best, try everything you can. And don't you worry what they tell themselves when you're away. It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle, it'll up the ride. Everything will be just fine, everything will be alright. Hey, you know they're all the same. You know you're doing better on your own, so don't buy in. Live right now. Yeah, just be yourself. It doesn't matter if it's good enough for someone else. It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of the ride. Everything will be just fine, everything will be alright. It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of the ride. Everything will be just fine, everything will be alright. Hey, don't write yourself off yet. It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on. Just do your best, do everything you can. And don't you worry what the bitter hearts are gonna say. It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of the ride. Everything will be just fine, everything will be alright. It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of the ride. Everything will be just fine, everything will be alright."  -"The Middle"  Well, I'm off to enjoy all this sunshine.

      What? You know, I get that a lot. I'm not the Evanescence type, or the Coldplay type, or the writing type, or the (insert random sport) type, or the anything type. I know that I am so many things that some people can't keep track of all of them, but I am anything I want to be. If I want to be a writer, I will.

      If you ever go to Caribou Coffee, you'd know what I mean. I went postering for the WYO (Woodbury Youth Orchestra) today, and used up all the posters I had at various places around SPP and CG.  I still don't know how that poem came out so well when I honestly had never written one in my life.  Speaking of life...you ever get the feeling that something's not quite right in yours?  Oh yeah-and My Immortal is just simply an awesome song. I've always liked Evanescence, but now they're one of my fav. bands. Does anyone have "Fallen" that I can burn? Anyone?!

      I never took poetry class this year, but you don't need any class to write something if there's enough substance. I couldn't sleep much last night, so I came up with this.  Drowning in sorrow lost in grief I suspected that it was too brief Too short to think Not enough time To try and make my feelings rhyme  I made a mistake So what? Big deal? I thought that it would surely heal I had no previous experience No guru to consult I wish I had just thought this through But now myself I insult  I once thought myself a wiseman Yet now I know I am not The knowledge I seek, to reap and to keep Cannot be bought or sold  And so I ask, in the name of God fogiveness for my sin Yet now I know, for whom the bell tolls I simply cannot win  A drop of sadness A drip of pain A gush of madness Its all rain Rain filling my bucket Filling my soul Flooding my conscience in a never-ending bowl  The deluge will not cease The torrent will not stop I cannot slow its ruining of my mental crop  I wish it never started I wished it to never end There could not be any death if birth was not to send a message to the world something bold something fresh  With haste, swift haste I close the curtain and the sash Curtain to tatters Sash to ash  And so, on cue I bid adieu to but one of all the rest  And so, on cue I bid adieu to the one that I know best   I never knew I could write like that.

      yep-the regular school semester is FINALLY over...thank God. no more homework, and starting next week I'll get to bike every day during school, plus I get phy ed. that ought to help out with my getting ready for biking races...  As for today, it went well, em, the school day did anyhow.  Biology: watched a movie on global demographic changes  Spanish: Watched "The Princess Bride". I listened to Bob Seger and The Silver Bullet Band, The Fire Inside, and U2, All That You Can't Leave Behind. Portable audio rocks...and I put a cool color scheme on the top, so now it looks good.  Study Hall: studied a bit for the social CE test, listened to some more music. I want the Evanescence cd though...  Social: the test was pretty simple, and I got a 48/50  After school: I went over to the Y to shoot pool, which is what I might go do tonight again. Oh yeah, and I know you'll all say "WHAT?!" at this, but Amanda and I aren't going out anymore. yep, its over, so you can kill me and not have anyone care...lol j/k. but yeah...  Kinda odd how they were playing Three Days Grace's hit song at the Y today right before I had to leave...

      This song has been stuck in my head for the past day-especially when I was out biking. Its been on the radio a lot, and its one of my favourite (hehe alternate spellings) songs right now. It deserves to be in here.  "I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You [x4]  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you"  Yeah...good song

      Today was one of the worst days in history. well...maybe there wasn't a record number dead in Iraq today, but its amazing how well that one word can describe a day. fuck.  Firstly: I went out biking tonight at 6:30. I got a flat just west of Jamaica ave. in Cottage Grove. It was quite a long ways to walk to Derrick's house, my house, or library-which was close to closing. So I walked in the cool evening air over to Amanda's place, where I waited until 9:00, when I used a Schwan Foods employee's cell phone to call my dad. Shortly thereafter, Amanda and Emily got home from the Park play, which was apparently pretty good. So...after waiting out in the cold (in shorts and a t-shirt, I might add) for quite  a spell, I finally got heat. Then my dad showed up, demanding that I leave right that moment. On top of that...well...I'll just leave it that I was disappointed.  Oh yeah, and there's a test tommorow. fuck. in Social, so it shouldn't be too hard, but its a test nonetheless. I just want to sleep all day tommorow and not have to do ANYTHING. Not have to care about anything, not have to give a fuck.

      Or rather the daily grind. I'm sick of it! You know when you get progressively tired throughout the week? Yeah...thats one thing I don't like. Get to sleep at around 11:15 every night, get up at 6:30. Repeat. Wake up, eat breakfast (staring out the window is optional), repeat. There's only 2 more days of this crap, and there won't be any homework assigned today or tommorow as its the last day of regular classes for us. That's one hell of a big plus. However, my mom was complaining about my grades last night. Yep, about MY grades-she never does that! And all it was was 2 B's, and one in Biology should be a B+! I could see that if I had a D or something, but for a B? forget it. And you know what? our parents couldn't do have as well as we do in our classes, and yet they still complain. pathetic.

      Hm...lets see. I went for a bike ride after school yesterday, didn't do homework, etc. Now, since I apparently "didn't eat a salad" with dinner last night, I don't get to go to the Y after school today to shoot pool. damn them

      mmhmm...lotsa reasons to smile today:  1. I got back 7 points on my math test, so now I have an A- in the class. whoohoo!  2. Band. band's always fun, right?  3. The sight of the "tree hugs" of Matt, Anton, Pat, Sam, Will, and Kevin Gray in Biology, Spanish, and during the firedrill was pretty funny. Especially when they all fell over as this big pile in spanish.  4. The book Fahrenheit 451 is really fun to read, so that explains English. Oh-and we get to watch some more Twilight Zone episodes soon!  5. I got a perfect score (80 out of 80) on my social test, so my table, consisting of me, Nathaniel Trulsen, Mary Speckhard, Saali, and Caitlin, was the "perfect table". We all got perfects, which was pretty cool.  6. There was no jazz band today, so I got the opportunity to go over to the Y and play pool with Will, Dan, Ajay, Mikesh, and Pat. Of course, I went. I think I played much better Saturday night-I got beat by Pat once, and Will like 4 times. lol  7. Not a whole lot of homework tonight.  8. Tommorow's a pretty special day too.  9. Orchestra. erm...afterwards ::wink::  Ok, so yeah. Today was a really good day, especially for a Monday. As for last night, all I did was the biology lab report (yeah...I kick myself if I purposefully ignore assignments), had some tea, played piano, and added a new constellation to my ceiling (I think that makes 9, including 2 zodiac constellations). Now when I look up at night, Aquarius stands faithful, facing Scorpio (I'm a scorpio). I had a good few thoughtful moments last night looking at that...mmhmm  I wish every day this week could be like this. Who knows? maybe it will. Well...probably not because of those stupid tests in social and biology, and that crappy Spanish packet, but you never know.  Hmmm...don't think I ever used this original quote in here...plus it fits. Who cares if I have 35 bucks now?  "In the eyes of gold I may be a pauper. Yet behind that stare I am rich beyond all imagination."  ~Bren~

      Ok, well here it is. Haven't blogged since Thursday, and there's sooooo much stuff.  Friday:  Biology: I honestly don't remember what we did, and you wouldn't care anyway. Hmm...to do this lab report or not and let people suffer...  Spanish: Fridays are sometimes for movies in spanish, right? Erm, not exactly a movie, "Newsies" wasn't a film I looked forward to much. Thank God for music and cd players. Hm...I think I listened to "Whatever and Ever Amen" by Ben Folds Five, and then Led Zeppelin III.  Study hall: crammed (sort of) for that social test, and listened to more music of course.  Social: took a test which I think I got a perfect on. not too hard to do in social, but hey.  Here comes the fun part....  After school:  I raced home on the bus, only to get to the house to do some cleaning for the evening's party. Namely vacuuming the downstairs and mopping some floors. Plus I got yelled at for not walking the dogs. Keep in mind that I only had about an hour and 15 minutes to walk the dogs, vacuum, mop, shower, change, and pack up for the concert.  At about 4:40 (more like exactly), Amanda showed up so we could give her a ride to the MOA concert, and then the party afterwards. Speaking of the concert...  *Note* Mr. Shelton notified me that there was going to be a drum set there available for use THE MORNING OF THE FRICKING CONCERT! And, of course, I had spent plenty of time the night before packing up the school's drum set. Which happens to be in my car at the time. *Note*  The concert didn't go too well in my opinion. The drummer who owned the set was a f*cking asshole, and wouldn't let me use his cymbols without, "putting down 300 dollars on insurance in case you break them". HOW THE HELL AM I GOING TO BREAK CYMBOLS WITH DRUM STICKS PLAYING THEM FOR 25 MINUTES?!?! The set was pretty much a rock drum set, so the toms were really really dead-they hardly had any tone at all. The school's drum set, which I greatly prefer, was in my car at the time. And by the way, the performance right after us was a choir, so the drummer had to take down his set anyway. WE COULD HAVE USED OURS!!!!! DAMN HIM. So we ended up with a drumset that sounded like absolute shit for jazz music, 1 cymbol, and the band that the other drummer was from didn't even let us use their amps. Plus I heard the guy's comment, "I'm going to give him so much set he won't know how to use it all." The fuck I do! I think I know what I'm doing after 4 years...I had to restrain from giving the guy not one, but 2 fingers when I left. fuckers.  Needless to say, the party was quite a bit better than the concert. Even Mr. Shelton stopped by for a little while. All the people that were there:  Me (thats a given) Jamie Bob Dan Lawless Sam Matt Pat Anton Mikesh Amanda Kelly and Megan Shwartzbauer (I think I got that right) and their younger brother and parents Other random parents Ajay  There were probably more people there, but I was kinda tired so I might not remember. There were some really funny moments though:  1. The first people there (aside from Amanda and myself) were Jamie and Bob, who happened to be "lost" in front of my house. They walk inside, talking to me on the cell phone.  2. I somehow flipped a cup upright on the table once, so Bob proceeded to do that three times. I for some reason just couldn't do it again. "So, uh, are we going to watch you and Bob flip cups all night?" No, I don't think we did, Jamie.  3. "Rolling down the hill with Anton." -- Self explanatory.  4. Bob, Anton, Sam, Matt, and I all jousted and dueled with large sticks and branches, which was pretty funny. I ended up with a few cuts between doing that and wrestling Matt. Good sticks are hard to find.  5. Jamie yells out "There's only one slice of pizza left!" from the top of the hill, so all of us guys sprinted up. I passed everyone except Bob, who got a pretty good lead. Oh yeah, and about that pizza: we were at first going to have frozen pizza, because my mom didn't want to spend the money to order out. Thankfully my dad had a little bit of sense in him and ordered some Pizza hut stuff. btw...God did want us to have ordered-out pizza (lol, inside joke).  6. Bob sneezes and gets pizza up his nose.  7. A not so great moment: my mom had to be down by the fire with all of us (yes, we had a bonfire), since it was windy and dry. The grass almost caught fire too, and we hadn't had a fire in that pit for probably over a year and a half.  8. Matt, Pat, Sam, Mikesh, Anton, Ajay, and I all played "Bloody Murder". Come to think of it, it wasn't all that fun. It was a little cold, and I probably should have been down at the fire. Although I have to admit, running down the hill, tripping over the hose, rolling on my back and landing on my feet was pretty fun.  9. Matt, Pat, Mikesh, Anton, and Ajay all had a bit too much fun on my drum set. The cops could have been called.  10. At around 10, lotsa people got a little tired. I was exhausted-the week really drained me, and Amanda was the only other person there as tired as I was.  Come 11:00, I was still up, just wandering aimlessly around the house (lol). Finally at about 12:30 I decided to sleep, so I crashed until noon Saturday. I feel sorry for those who had to get up for Chops Saturday.  And that brings me to Saturday:  Pretty uneventful until about 5:00, when I went up to the Y/teen center. I shot pool until 7:00, which was when I changed into my suit for the gala at Central Park. I left my music at school (which was locked) so I had to borrow it from another member of the choir.  Speaking of the gala performances:  1. A really really horrible, I mean absolutely distasteful rendition of our national anthem. *cringes*  2. The second performance I really didn't like was the Woodbury Dance center's performance to some stupid disco-dance music. Also, the outfits had small skirts with glittering tops, and golden pom-poms. Not fitting for an expensive Gala raising money for a piano for Central Park. Keep in mind these were probably 9 and 10 year old girls. Definately not fitting with the Baroque atmosphere.  After all that I went back to the teen center, and found out that wearing a suit doesn't really affect how you shoot pool. Like it would anyway...  I considered gonig to the Underground for an hour, but it wouldn't be that fun, as I was tired, and I didn't know if anyone notable besides Drew would be there for certain. Instead I practiced music, played scrabble over a cup o' tea, and laughed hysterically at how horrible the board was. It was horrendous-nowhere to build off of, and my dad's to blame. Needless to say, I lost by a sound 41 points.  No SNL last night, since I had to get up at 7:30 for church this morning. I actually looked forward to church more than other weeks today, as it was service sunday. I know, I don't often include much religious stuff in here, but today was different. I volunteered at the Walker Methodist nursing home for getting the seniors (by that I mean 80 and 90 year olds in wheel chairs) to and from their church service. To be honest, it didn't sound like much fun at first, but it is. You really get the feeling that you made a difference in their lives, which are pretty uniform most of the time. Its a bigger responsibility than you think, and they really do appreciate it. I remember a few of them: I helped Rosa Powers to and from church, which was probably better since she didn't like the idea of change much. Clarence was a real character, and James was cool too.  It might not seem like much, but it really does change you. Specific things too. I assisted Lucy in getting to church (not just down a few ramps-its going through the whole building, elevators, etc.), and after she was situated in the church she thanked me and said "God bless you". Again, its not much, but coming from an elderly person that you really don't know all that well is, well, you feel closer to God.  lol, so yeah, I had a really good day so far. Other than that, there's not a whole lot much else, except me avoiding homework. This weather's beautiful too...I wish more days could be like this.

      1. A diamond does not roll; a wheel does. 2. A diamond looks better on an engagement ring.  where the f*ck am I going with this?  I'm actually thinking of quitting biking and taking up baseball again, perhaps on a Woodbury team, and perhaps on Will's team.  Reasons you ask? 1. I suck at biking (haven't won anything), but I enjoy it. 2. I used to be good at baseball (doesn't mean I'm bad now, because I just haven't played in, erm, years), and I enjoy it. 3. Biking takes more commitment, and I barely get to go on practice rides, let alone race. And in the races, I suck. I get dropped off the back and can't keep up. 4. Biking also requires much more driving than an in-house baseball league.  I don't know if I'll really be trading in the ol' Orbea for a uniform and glove, but it might happen.

      Alright then, Ruminator Books is closing. I found that out yesterday, but here's the catch. I could've had that story before both Twin Cities newspapers did! I was in a lunchtime interview with the owner for MITY, but I didn't ask if they were closing.  Plus today the students lost the Students vs. Staff softball game...as always...  I won't be attending the EV concert because there's no one to go with that I can get a seat near. Meh, kinda expensive anyway. Geez, if I can't afford the concert, I'll never get a copy of Origin...  So the talent show is tommorow, and I'm doing lighting. Megan Woods is doing sound, but she wants to do lighting for a few acts. No-can-do; we can't have people running around in the booth, and lighting and sound chairs aren't exactly next to each other.  Also dealing with theater, we got a full tour of the Macalester College theatre, including walking up on the catwalks and going up to the top grid (over twice as high as the main catwalks). So that was groovy.  I really should be on Tech crew next year, unless we're doing music, and not if I get a part in the play. Theatre is where I belong...eh, sort of.

      I had one story today for journalism on Ruminator Books, the independent book store on Grand Ave. in St. Paul. Had to scramble it together because I interviewed the owner over lunch, but its a good one.  I also happened to pick up a book there: 50 Ways YOU Can Show George the Door in 2004. Great book for people who want to know what to do about getting Bush out of office.  k, well I'm extremely tired, and I have nothing else to say

      And the pattern continues...I keep getting less than 8 hours dammit. This weekend is going to be the "Land of Eternal Sleep".  As for MITY today, I did horrible in the geo-bee. I only got 1 article in the paper, and the jazz class ditched our reporters and left a half hour earlier than expected. So now we have no story for their performance at the Hot Summer Jazz Festival.  I'm stuck in a hole and can't get out. I need a girlfriend.

      My evenings suck. I've had driver's education, work, piano and drum lessons (I have one of each tonight), and other stuff every single night. Combine that with having MITY all day (which is fun, but a lot of time), there's not much time left to do anything. I had about 5 minutes last night to post. When I get home at 4:30 or so today, I have to mow a lawn, then have music lessons.  I've gone from having 10.5 hours of sleep per night to having less than 8 per night, and more stuff happening. Not too great.  Cailin (guy in Journalism) "ditched" (couldn't find all of us) the rest of the people who were playing Trivial Pursuit. Thus, I lost. Horribly. Each other team of 3 had 3 chips, and I had 1. 1 on 3 on 3 isn't easy, and to make it tougher, one of the 3 key players on the "Brain" team last year (Whitney) was on the DNA team, playing against me. Hopefully I'll do better in the geo-bee, and won't be the only one in it.  Also, I went from having 1 article in the MITY paper on both Monday and Tuesday, to having 3 articles in today's paper. I doubt I'll be able to do 3 articles per day.  A little bit of news: The MN legislature may agree to vote on, and even pass a new law outlawing smoking in all public workplaces, restaurants, and even those smoky sports bars. It'd be about time for that to happen.

      Ok, so MITY started this week. I'm part of the team that reports on stuff happening around campus, but beyond that, MITY is soooo awesome. I've met really awesome people there, and through those people I've met even more really awesome people. lol  All the people I know because of MITY: Amelia Alex Liz Shayl Jemma Megan Whitney  Ok, so they're all girls...uh...I can't explain that one

      Before I rest my head on the pillow for tonight, I guess I might as well rest my mind on this "page", so to speak. With my second cup of herbal tea for tonight, and Guster on the radio, I'm getting a little drowsy...  Last night I wound up going to the weekly Magic: The Gathering draft tourney up at Unicorn Games in Oakdale. I did horribly, with 1 win, 3 losses (a total of 4 matches). Oh, and the only reason I won the last match was because the other guy's dad had come to pick him up early, so he dropped. He would have beaten me.  I won't be the first to mention this whole perfectionistic touch-typing thing, but I am one myself. Being drowsy is making some odd words appear on the screen right now (like ilke).  This whole past week I have been staying up late (until 1 or 2) playing starcraft online. Now its the time to adjust, meaning still go to bed relatively late and set the alarm. Not much fun. But I have to adjust for MITY, so I guess thats alright.  Not deviating from my average wakeup time for this week, I awoke at 5 min. to noon today. *polishes off tea and thinks* Practicing pool shots (with Dan) at the Y (oh-and Courtney was there too), and playing Halo and Red Faction 2 with Josh, Dan, and Tom basically made up my day.  If you're wondering who Courtney is, she works at the Y, teen center usually. I think it must have been before some band concert this spring at Central Park, before which I shot pool for several hours. Wearing a nice suit, mind you. I played solo for a little while, but then since there wasn't anyone else to play, I played her. So thats how I know her, eh, sort of.  On the way back to Dan's place from the Y, my right foot slipped of the pedal (clipless, so regular shoes suck), and got a little messed up. Now it hurts to walk, and bringing the tea up the stairs didn't feel good either.  While watching last night's NOW: With Bill Moyers show on PBS, one story struck me. The humanitarian crisis in western Sudan is starting to sound a little like the Rwanda genocide. The Sudanese government is driving all of the Darfurians (Muslims of Western Sudan) out of Sudan and into Chad. The government has sided with the Janjaweed Arab malitia in completing village burnings, including murders, rapes, and overall destruction that would make it impossible for these people to return to their homes. The entire story can be found  urlLink here .  Take a moment to ponder this:  Should we as a country and world power be spending more time (and money, of course) on helping to fix these kinds of problems, or should we go into countries (Iraq) solely to gain countrol of their oil supply?  I hope the answer is obvious for you.

      Its only a few weeks into the summer break, and I've almost lost track of which day it is already. Eh, won't happen next week-when MITY starts (yay!). That goes for 2 weeks, then I have 2 weeks off, then another 2 weeks of MITY (yay!). Sometime after that I have a music camp at Music Tech where I'll be taking drum lessons from Gordy Knutson (you know, the drummer from the Steve Miller Band-famous guy), and then a little jazz workshop with Doug Little for a week. I'll be the pianist for that.   I will soon be the official pool shark of the Y...

      Ronald Reagan, a.k.a. "Butch" (oops-did I put a "B" instead of a "D"? eh...), is dead. The second worst president of the United States ever (oh, and the worst is in office right now), who was the guy who started the whole "Starwars" national (needless) missile defense system. Mr. Ray-Guns coined "trickle-down economics", the worst economic policy/theory ever put in place, oh-and its still in use under "monkeyass's" rule (America is a monarchy, right??). Mr. Dutch also loosened restrictions on America's auto industry, so you can blame HIM whenever you see a fat-ass hummer on the road today. Reagan's policies were crap, and Bush lives the legacy.  Oh, and about this week-long marathon burial: Clinton won't get one that long, will he now? Most likely not, since he "caused" the large national debt (which is actually the "monkey's" doing).  Needless to say, Reagan didn't deserve the attention he got for saying what people wanted to hear and doing otherwise (that means he made false promises, everyone), and Bush sucks even worse.

      Marching:  1. First Parade for Park Marching Band today for the Cottage Grove Strawberry Days festival. This year's cadence: Flammables. This year's first song: It Don't Mean a Thing (If it Ain't Got That Swing. After the parade we all walked over to a park in CG for after-parade things (food, etc.).  2. I marched behind a mower for quite a spell today. Did 1 lawn last night, 1 today, and started 2 today.  Add to that, I got to sleep at midnight. Not that late considering Jamie and Becky got to sleep 4-5ish. I shouldn't be complaining, but I'm tired and my feet hurt.  Today's song: Hard Day's Night, The Beatles  Time to veg until I get too tired to stay awake anymore.

      Or rather a new face, eh? Well, you say, why black? I really have no idea, but I could try to explain it by saying I was feeling "deep, dark, and mysterious". It better describes my mind...  Hmm...anything interesting that happened today? I sauntered around Rosedale Mall with Liz and Shayl for a good 3-4 hours or so, and bought nothing except food at Subway. Then back at Liz's place we had a little fun with her digital camera (lol, nothing dirty).  Driver's ed was boring. I know how to parallel park already after years of observing my parents carefully. Damn permits.  Random thought: Kerry for President!  Here's a few good songs right now:  Dashboard Confessional: Vindicated Tears for Fears, covered by Gary Jules: Mad World Hoobastank: The Reason Coldplay: Amsterdam Yellowcard: Way Away Yellowcard: Ocean Avenue  Pretty much the whole Yellowcard cd rocks, and I still have yet to buy it...which I plan to do when I have money.  It's off to catch the rest of Conan!

I'll start with the new.  There's only 2 more performances of The Imaginary Invalid left, 2:00 and 7:30 tommorow. A lot of hard work went into this production by the tech crew, cast, band, and directors, so I better see  everyone  there...  I'll still be busy, even after school's out, but whats new. Marching band, MITY, MusicTech camp, jazz stuff, and friends of course.  I best be outta here, Bren

      I'm currently taking&nbsp;a jazz drumming course over at MusicTech College in St. Paul. Ensembles, jazz history, etc. (remember, music is pretty much my life). The main drumming teacher is Gordy Knudtson. Yep, the drummer from The Steve Miller Band, and he's also a pretty famous jazz drummer. He's got connections to people all over, including some guys in the band on Jay Leno, and Letterman. Plus, "Max Weinberg is a hack."  Aside from GK meaning Gordy Knudtson,&nbsp;does anyone remember Gene Krupa? Famous jazz drummer from the 40s or so. He drummed on "Sing, Sing, Sing". crazy...  I've been taking the bus more. Everyone should. Supporting mass-transit helps with traffic. But really, instead of building more damn roads and 24-lane highways, we should build a kick-ass lightrail system. Wouldn't it be nice to take a train into St. Paul from most anywhere? Plus, everyone needs to downsize their f*cking SUVS...drive cars more on the scale of MINIs, ok?  Anyone ever been movie-hopping? It rocks...theres enough semi-good to good movies out that I might go this weekend over to Carmike again. They won't notice you, even if you're wearing a bright blue jacket and wandering the halls looking for movies all day/afternoon/evening/night.  Movies worth seeing that I haven't seen yet&nbsp;(well, most anything considering I'm not paying for them all, but...): 1. Harold and Kumar go to White Castle (uh...stupid. really really stupid, but funny) 2. I, Robot (looks ok) 3. The Bourne Supremacy (looks really f*cking good) 4. The Manchurian Candidate (political thriller, I'll take it...then again, Denzel Washington plays hero again) 5. The Village (ok, so Signs wasn't scary. at all. hopefully this will fair better)  Hey, 5 movies. I sense a hopping schedule coming on...now I need someone, or someones to go with. Dylan, you're coming this time, unless, well, you know. Plus Emily, I think you might like it. Derrick, I'm not so sure you can get in by "asking for the phone". You go ahead and try it, but I won't.  Oh, and Buddy, do f*ck off. Please. I'm sick of you.

      Yep, it's already halfway through the second week of the second session of MITY this year, which means that there's only 2 days left in the year of the monkey (don't ask...lol). It's sad to think that I might not play ultimate again this year *tear*. That's if Amelia visits Macalester on Friday, but then I get to play Scrabble! Eh...I'm thorougly obsessed.  Up in the booth again...and whoa-Megan's back! lol, my "associate" from Journalism up in the control booth last session is visiting for a few days. That means that yet again, I won't be the one that Mr. Rec blames for bad sound, and I won't be the one, yet again, yelling out the booth window to Mr. Rec during the show. lol.  I'm beginning to think that I like Journalism more than I do Debate. Lincoln-Douglas debate sucks, and debate requires a hell of a lot more work. Plus with Journalism, the whole campus reads (or should read) what you wrote. So its your work getting published, and you can read it in the paper. Plus, I got to interview some of the higher-ups in Macalester and I nearly beat out the Star Trib. and P. Press to a story (see previous posts pertaining to the Ruminator Book Store). I'm better at writing news stories under pressure than writing damned debate speeches in 3 minutes all while sifting through information to find arguments and rebuttals to arguments. Pretty tiring I'd say.  After being at MITY for 3 years, it really pays off. You get to know the "regulars", meet cool people, play ultimate frisbee (yay!), and you have the opportunity to become a well-known part of the MITY community. Helping out with the talent show, being active around campus, famous Rec Hour athlete, etc. lol  Okay, so I'm really tired, and apparently I have the ability to yawn and make other people yawn also (lol Emily). I best be off. *yawns*

       Alrighty then, its 10:40, I'm tired, and I still have to pack a lunch for tomorrow. Thus I only have about 5 minutes to make a post.    &nbsp;  Yesterday:   It was a good day, you know, the kind of day you have in the middle of the summer that's actually fun? I skipped church because I had to mow a lawn, and then relaxed for a few hours in the afternoon. Walked the dogs, did the dishes, and picked up Emily (a friend of mine who's a friend of Amanda's) at 4:00. *Why I hate the Teen Center Sometimes* They close prematurely on Sundays because, "no one was in there." We were going to be in there! Eh, I guess it couldn't have been better than taking a walk around the area, playing some ping-pong, and listening to music and chatting, could it? ...nah    &nbsp;  Today: Today was pretty hot and sticky, and yet I still played Ultimate Frisbee after my lunch of 1 Quaker Chewy bar. I had to work through the lunch hour on my speeches for debate because I was sick on Friday and didn't do any work over the weekend. Needless to say, I kicked major ass in the debates. Everyone's saying I'm the best in the class, and I guess I very well may be (see how modest that was?). Plus there's this girl (Sofia)&nbsp;that's kinda likin' me, but it's not happening. I have no interest in her whatsoever.    &nbsp;  After MITY, and watching Ken Jennings win his 34th game of Jeopardy, I headed off to Park High for marching band, which was really hot and sticky, once again. First rehearsal in over a month, and we weren't as bad as I had thought we would be. To add the physical and mental exhaustion that I'm currently experiencing, I had to wait over a half hour for my mom to get there. More like 45 minutes. We got out of band at 8:50, and she didn't get there until 9:35 because she was on the damned phone. Typical, isn't it?

       Well, at least I’m not going to scream about George Bush the whole time this time around.  Question: who hates being stuck somewhere with no money, no cell phone, nothing to do, and no ride? Anyone? Of course you do.  Question: Don’t you also hate it when your parents screw up and you have 4 hours of your time wasted? Of course you do.  Last night I was supposed to have driver’s education from 6 to 9, and it was supposedly class number 8. However, we arrived, I went in, and my mom left. I walk in on lesson number 6, which is about road rage, which I’ve already had.  --Problem: mom leaves without checking which lesson it is (I did ask her, repeatedly mark you, about which lesson it was).  So then I figure, well hey, if I go over to the Woodbury Junior High, I can call home and/or try to page my mom. To my luck, I discovered, after wandering about the school for a while (checking to see how dingy the classrooms were), that the only school personnel present was a librarian on the second floor. To my luck, the Counseling Office was unlocked and empty on the first floor, so I ducked in and used the phone in one of the offices.  --Problem: Dad isn’t home yet, and my mom obviously didn’t go home.  Hmm…what to do next? Nothing but wander about the school for about 10 more minutes. Then I figured I should call my dad again, so I stopped over at the PDQ gas station, and waited 10 for some random asshole to get off the phone. Just remember that I only had a dollar on me, which was quickly half-burned up in 1 phone call to my dad.  --Problem: Dad’s home, but doesn’t have the other car. Mom’s gone at a meeting. Dad tries to page mom several times.  If you were in a situation such as this, you might go for a walk. The time is now close to 7:00. I walk east for a while, eventually stopping at the Target Greatland. After asking where the hell the phones were, I used up the last 50 cents in another call to my Dad. Mom hasn’t called back after repeated pages, and potentially did not have her pager with her.  --Problem: Mom may not have pager with her, and I don’t know her cell phone number.  What would you do in a target store with 20 cents? Look at all the music and CDs you wish you could buy, of course. There were probably about 7 or 8 albums I wanted, but of course I couldn’t even afford 1 fucking song on iTunes.  --Problem: Stuck at a Target store with 20 cents and music all around you.  After wandering aimlessly about the store, watching the music videos of "Take Me Out", by Franz Ferdinand, and "Broken", by Seether featuring Amy Lee of Evanescence, I went outside. Time is now close to 8:00. I sit outside for an hour and 15 minutes, coughing on the smell of cigarette smoke, watching random people and couples go in and out of the store, and get offered a tattoo by 2 young assholes chanting "Waka-Waka." I overhear a conversation between a worker and a security personnel about something a "guy in a green Honda and his girlfriend did." I didn’t catch what they did.  Okay, so I’m sitting outside Target in Woodbury, watching the sunset. Alone. Romantic, huh? The time is nearing 9:00. I’ve made a habit of checking my watch every 5 minutes or so, just to make sure time didn’t stop altogether and leave me sitting in front of a Target for eternity.  At 9:15, the Red Fuckus (or, alternatively, Fuckusall), shows up.  So what really screwed me over last night?   Safeway in Woodbury changed their schedule.  My mom left too quickly, and never checked which lesson it was.  My dad didn’t bring the other car home last night instead of today.  My mom left her pager at home.  My mom didn’t have her cell phone on.  My mom didn’t give me the other cell phone (don’t know what that would have done).  My dad didn’t make an effort to borrow a car and pick me up.  The result?  1. Marooned on the concrete edge of the shrubbery bed at Target in Woodbury for 2 hours.  2. Now I'm sick.

      What a day. In BD (Beginning Debate) at MITY (The Minnesota Institute for Talented Youth) we're starting the Student Congress debate format. I'm researching for the negative side of a National Missile Defense system. I promise, I won't go on a huge fucking rant about how much I hate Bush and his shitty ideas (this one was actually Reagan's), but National Missile Defense is bogus.  Rec hour: Instead of participating in the trivial pursuit tourney, I expected to be in a softball game. However, since I like really freakin hard challenges, I played a game of ultimate (frisbee). 5 on about 10 or 12, with me being on the team of 5 with Grant, Cailin, Connor, and Marco. We were obviously superior ultimate players, because even with having to cover 3 people at once, our team of 5 won, 12-11. One hell of a close game, but the other team had the lead only once. The rest of the time we were up by 1, or even 2, or tied. Playing hard ultimate in a black t-shirt on a hot day=physical drainage.  After MITY: Instead of getting a ride from my mom, I decided to stay (I had my Orbea on campus with me, which kicked ass because I could get around much better). So of course, me, Grant, Cailin, Stephanie, Marco, Connor, and a few other people tossed around the disc. Oh, and I have a habit of slipping in the only mud spot on the whole field. As for ultimate: there's a reason why I'm called "the cherrypicker". It's great having a huge vertical. playing more ultimate=more physical drainage  Also, I did ride my Orbea home from Macalester. With one hell of a heavy backpack. It took about 1 hour and 10 minutes, plus I ran out of water, and plus the backpack kept slightly cutting off circulation in my arms...damn thing. biking home with a heavy backpack from St. Paul after playing lots of ultimate=hellish physical drainage. Plus my back hurts.  I guess I should get more sleep tonight...

      So now I'm taking Beginning Debate. Watch out-I recommend avoiding getting into arguments and political debates with me. I'll kick your ass. lol  I already know that I'll have some bones to pick with a few people in my class. They're both staunch republicans, and one can't even come up with 3 good reasons (that aren't based on faulty CIA intelligence...) why George W. Bush should be elected this November. He couldn't come up with 3...like there even are 3.  As for today:  I was late for MITY and missed the opening convocation because my car broke down (you know, the red Ford Fuckus ZX5). There were some problems with the fuel exhaust recirculation system, so when you tried to start the car it would turn over and quit. So, my dad took forever (as usual) in getting the other car driven a mile away from our house (literally). After the switch, avoiding some traffic and some detours, I got to Macalester at 9:00.  As it turned out, on the contrary to my guess, Debate is in Olin Rice Science hall, at the far south end of the campus, whereas I thought it would be held in Carnegie Hall. Too bad-Carnegie is closer to everything on Campus...  You probably have no clue of what I'm talking about, so just pay a visit to the Macalester Liberal Arts College campus on Grand Ave. in St. Paul sometime. It's a nice place.  After MITY: 1. Played some ultimate frisbee, got dirty. 2. Drove to Blimpie Subs in St. Paul, and got shitty service. The guy didn't know how the fuck to make a turkey, ham, and salami on Sesame Seed without cheese. 3. Drove to Saxon Ford to pick up the red Fuckus, decided not to go to Bike practice tonight. Instead I mowed a lawn that was 12 inches tall. I swear on it.  Now: pack a lunch, sleep. In that order. -_-

      Yep, I went movie hopping today over at Carmike in Oakdale with Derrick, and left without getting kicked out. Movies I saw:  1. King Arthur -Pretty brutal with the battles, and a little unreal in parts, but its a pretty good movie if you liked LOTR.  2. Dodgeball -A Ben Stiller pseudo comedy...enough said. If you want a good summary, head over to Amelia's blog, which can be found  urlLink here .  3. Spider-Man 2 -I didn't see the first, but I don't think it could've been much better. It was surprisingly enjoyable for a comic-book character based movie.  4. Anchorman -Will Ferrill poses as anchorman for a network. Very funny movie.  I'm off to bed.

      If the President can get away with lying about Weapons of Mass Destruction, I could get away with lying about when I'm returning from vacation, right? The weather sucked up in Brainerd-cold and rainy. Not good weather for biking...  What I did and didn't do on a 2-day vacation:  Did- -sleep in -ate at China Buffet -ate at Prairie Bay Heartland Restaurant (they have a $157 bottle of wine there...) -biked 15 miles -saw Fahrenheit 9/11 (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!) -went bowling at Paul Bunyan Bowl -played pool at Paul Bunyan bowl  Did not- -go biking enough -see the movies I wanted  So its nearly determined that I'll quit biking and either: 1. start up baseball again 2. play tennis (yay!)  Also another thing I plan to do some day soon is go movie hopping the whole day at Oakdale cinemas. Pay for 1 movie, see 4. Good deal if you ask me.

      The 4th was pretty fun, and I got to blow up some cans with firecrackers, etc. The rockets I bought weren't as good as I thought they would be though...  I'm also leaving for vacation up in Brainerd tommorow, so this will be my last post for 4 days. Basically I get to bike around with my parents, who happen to be slow, for 4 days. Fun.  See ya'll lata

      Just got back from walking the dogs at midnight, and it's raining out there. We needed rain, rather badly, but I did happen to get quite wet.  I went to Prescott to get some fireworks today...the real kind. That was pretty fun. However...  Shayl's in the hospital with a fractured skull and a bad blood clot near her brain. Results of a bike crash w/o a helmet. I wasn't there, and probably couldn't have done anything, but I for some reason could have expressed the importance of wearing a helmet. I'm a racer, so if I didn't wear a helmet: 1. I would be kicked off the team. 2. It wouldn't be possible to kick me off the team if I was dead. Crashes suck, but without a helmet they can be catastrophic.  How many teens have to get seriously hurt before people start wearing helmets?  No real happy note today, and I'm tired.  P.S. We're all pulling for you Shayl. Just hang on a little longer...

      So I'm on a Mac computer at Mac college, and I decided to listen to the radio streaming. Under alternative, Virgin Radio, UK looked alright (it's British, so thats automatically a plus). They're playing all the best British bands (and others), and its great. Bands like...(and I know all of these)  Snow Patrol U2 The Cure The Verve Franz Ferdinand (deep cuts like Matinee too!!) The Strokes Red Hot Chili Peppers Scissor Sisters The Rolling Stones Dido Eagle-Eye Cherry Keane Talking Heads Crowded House Morrissey   Plus the British accents and mentionings of Wimbledon are cool. Even the downtown England traffic report is fun-there's a highway there named Southbound M3. Yet another reason to move to England...  Britain simply does radio better. And I need to buy about 5 albums.

      Hm...what is there to talk about. Not much, other than that band tonight was kinda chilly and we're going to start field show work soon.  "Where are your asses? Squeezing grapes!" heh, yet another odd analogy from the Park High School Marching Band directors. Also another connection between PHSMB and Chops.  Hopefully my pool cue comes soon...I need that thing.

      Just a question here: What is everyone's reason for not wearing a helmet while biking around, etc.?  For everyone who wears a helmet, kudos. If you crash without a helmet, a concussion is likely. First Shayl, now my sister.  You shouldn't make excuses such as, "they look ugly", because they don't. And anyway, wearing plastic is better than having a damn concussion.  Why am I being constantly attacked by wave after wave of popup ads, popunder ads, and shitty programs that keep installing themselves?!

      It moved over a year ago from quite a bad spot in Bandana Square in St. Paul to the heart of Minneapolis in Nicollet Mall. Needless to say, there's much more business in the area. It's also the venue I've had the honor of playing at three times. Once with The Random (on drums), and twice with the Doug Little Twin Cities Jazz Workshop combo (on piano). Its fun playing a professional venue, especially when the inside of the Yamaha baby grand is littered with signatures and notes from pros all the way from Benny Green to Oscar Peterson. Playing that piano, well, its...awesome.  Songs we (the 8-piece combo) played: 1. All Blues, by Miles Davis 2. Little Sunflower, by Freddie Hubbard 3. Killer Joe, by Bennie Golson 4. um...some Cuban/Latin cha-cha-cha thing lol  Yep, I'm a jazz musician. I like the music, so what? And for all the people out there who think it's not music, it is. And it DOES take talent...lots of talent to become good at it. The art of improv doesn't come over night. And also I would think it takes more talent to become a jazz musician than to become some random rapper.  Also, despite some peoples' viewpoints, I am not poor. Well...relatively lol. I earned 50 bucks tonight mowing 2 lawns-the first money I've earned in many weeks. But, I've been known to spend money when I get it, that is, second on the list to putting all the money in the bank. Those 50 dollars went towards a brand new $76 blue Scorpion fiberglass-coated pool cue. hm...maybe I still don't deserve that kind of cue based on my playing...  And now the sleeping-in for the rest of August starts. What a relief ^_^

      Similar to the Musictech schedule...I had 7 more hours of music today between the jazz workshop and marching band...*bleh*  Blogging is like improvising-if you don't have much to say, don't say it. And I'm hellishly tired...

      Okay, so now I'm in the Doug Little jazz workshop on piano. more jazz...plus I have to get up earlier than for the MusicTech workshop. Not fun. Plus it's only a half-day thing, so that means almost a 2-hour bus ride home sometimes. Then I have to walk for like 40 minutes from the park and ride. I mean, I like mass transit, but geez.  Band was really hot tonight...hot and really sweaty, plus there's 3 new tunes we have to learn. Not too hard, but field shows start soon, and that's not all that easy I think.  The last 4 weeks in August I have off, so I'm volunteering all of my time during the week towards the Kerry/Edwards campaign at the campaign Headquarters in St. Paul. Phonecalls, being a gopher, envelopes, helping people out, etc. More people should do that-anything to get the monkey out of the White House. There's an overwhelming supply of volunteer's, but that's not a surprise. More than the majority of Americans want him out of office. As I've said before, what's worse: 1. Lying about having a sexual affair in the White House with an intern 2. Lying about various things, such as Weapons of Mass Destruction and uranium from Africa, just to attempt to build a case for war against a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and thus killing thousands upon thousands of innocent people, including countless American soldiers.  Again, I think the choice should be clear, just because the latter includes "loss of human life, which is a precious thing". I mean, come on. Who honestly cares if a president has sex with an intern? If that was enough to impeach a president, then Bush should be, well, impeached 20 times over. Impeached 20 times over and thrown into the street in front of a Kerry/Edwards-occupied White House and beaten by a mob of angry average Americans. Oh, and that time, there wouldn't be any of Daddy's Friends around to help him. Ideally, they would all be either gone and resigned, or in the street with the bloody bastard himself.
