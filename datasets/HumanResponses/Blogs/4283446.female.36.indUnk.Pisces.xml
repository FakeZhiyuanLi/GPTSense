      Well don't quite know where to start today!  I have had a busy few days and on top of that am not feeling 100% so it will be a short one I am afraid.  Thinking back to last weeks meetings with Rodger and I still cannot help being inspired by someone who puts in so much to the organisation, not to mention all of the knowledge being shared with me.  I am delighted to have found somebody with a mindset that I can respect and hopefully draw on in the future.  Couple of things we covered: Support from Management in relation to ideas and different projects Rodger has worked on, or lack of it depending on the situation.  I am continually impressed with Rodger's ability to fight the good fight and to continue on in the face of adversity because his students are of the utmost importance.  I personally find it frustrating that the term 'innovation' is bandied about by upper management, but from my experience, very rarely tapped into by their staff.  Let's say that I did come up with an awe inspiring project/idea/design, I would have very little desire to present it to my manager for fear of being made to look like an idiot!  I can't help but think sometimes they are scared about being 'shown up' by staff that perhaps are a little more innovative or happy to work on being proactive, when in fact they should be nuturing staff who are keen to contribute.  Another thing that we talked about, which seems terribly obvious to me now in hindsight, is the fact I should prepare a report for my Manager on the Flexible Learning Week conference I attended.  As it was never asked of me, I didn't think I should bother, but after a bit of reflection after discussing with Rodger, I am happy now to put together a report and if it is used as scribbling paper, bad luck at least I tried.  I certainly don't expect any feedback or comments.  So far it has been great discussing leadership qualities and challenges with Rodger not only for the information and knowledge he can share about our organisation, but also about contacts he has in other industries.  The anectdotes shared have been facinating and I am certainly keen to hear more to store away in my memory for future access when the need arises.  I am looking forward now to building on this, and especially since I have just discovered I have some small projects to deal with.  Hopefully my move to Dandenong in 5 weeks won't hinder our continued contact.  Thank god for Blogger!
