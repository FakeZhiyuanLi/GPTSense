       Number 1)   urlLink  http://www.saatchi.com/worldwide/     The first page that appears when you go to the Saatchi & Saatchi has two navigation options 1st is the option to choose is the high speed flash based pages 2nd is the low speed traditional pages.  The first option is different and takes a lot of patients to navigate the faster your computer is the easier it is. It starts out with illustrations of variouse objects, some of the objects are nav buttons and some are not this isn’t known until you move across each object and wait for the alt text to appear. I think this site is very different and artistic in a professional way.  The 2nd option is provided for those who have a pc that is not compatible with running flash images. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi have a slightly different than traditional navigation arrangement. To the left of the browser they have the navigation buttons. Each button is a rounded rectangle and of different colors with text that clearly states were the button will take you. They have also provided a search engine to help you find exactly what you are looking for. In the main page area there are pictures of the CEO and the Director these images are links to the profile of the individuals, they have also provided a text link for the same reason. None of the links have alternate text.       Number 2)       urlLink  http://www.musicplasma.com     Music plasma is a site designed specifically for people interested in music. You type in a name of a group which you like and the site recognizes it and brings up all the other groups with the same style of music. The groups are displayed in spheres with the one that you chose first being the larger sphere in the middle all the other groups are displayed in descending order out from the middle, the spears getting smaller and smaller as you go. If you choose one of the smaller ones it instantly becomes the larger centralized sphere with groups similar to it displayed in smaller spheres and so on and so on. Apart from the search engine provided for the site there is nothing traditional about this it.     Number 3)      urlLink http://www.xavierrudd.com/   This site has an awesome front page (very artistic) with only two navigation points both are fairly obvious but different from the norm .Once you have entered the site it becomes slightly more conventional. This is my favorite one, oh yeah his music is excellent to.
