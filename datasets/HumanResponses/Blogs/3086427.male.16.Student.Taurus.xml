       Shalom.  FINISHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Yep.It's finally over.The Quizbook is finally done,all 1600 questions or 300 pages of it.Went to Pizza Hut for a celebration dinner.In the remote case that you are interested ,it wil be out by July and most probably all factory products wil be required to buy it.  SAT preparation in full swing.Last score 1540,ie 800 in verbal and 740 in maths While verbal scores have consistently been improving,math scores stubbornly refuse to move.Any suggestions??  On a sad note ,I have been called upon to discharge my duties as President of the Gandagi Safai Club.This involves giving horrible speeches about even more horrible topics like Earth Day.The silver lining is that Dimple Kohli,the head Safai karamchari has promised me that nothing much would be required in future from me.Also,Anupriya ,a fellow Safai karamchari and class topper(92%) has handed in her resignation,and i have managed to recruit two more people in her place from the wild section,who have a lot of free time to do Vela stuff like this.  On an another sad note,all the HOD's have stubbornly refused to let us have any free time in school.read going for GSP's and other activities.  Vote for the BJP,or ask your parents to do so.

       Shalom. I started preparing for SAT today.I am giving the SAT on 1st May,which also happens to be my birthday. Yours truly will then complete 16 years of life on this planet.My centre is Modern School,Barakhamba Road,The Factory's arch-rival. This heralds a higly busy April for me.Apart from doing work for the quizbook, FIITJEE classes will start, an eternal source of stress and sorrow.Class 12th is in full swing with Monday tests around the corner.Added to this the additional burden of SAT .I have seriusly started thinking about night-outs,a concept i first discovered in IIT,Kanpur.

       shalom.  For those of you who don't know ,i'm a class 12th student of Delhi Public School,R.K.Puram,henceforth referred to as The Factory.This year I have been extremely fortunate in getting all the HOD's as my teachers,something unprecedented in The Factory's history.  here's a description of my teachers-  1.J.S.Virdi(Da Sardar)-HOD Physics and my first ever sardar teacher.Quite good.Has threatened the class with dire consequences if anyone scores less than 95% in the Boards.Only problem-some wicked soul of the Timetable Deptt. has fixed all his periods with us at around 12'o'clock.  2.Meena Dhami(Da Owl)-HOD Chemistry.Being in her class is the surest way of getting into IIT.Last year,around 37 out of her 50 students made it ,a success rate of 74%.Has a penchant for treating students like 4-year olds and for physically acting out chemical processes. Sample-Reversible reactions are indicated by crossing arms,ionic bonds with interlocking of fingers.  3.Sushma Suneja(Odoyo ki maa)-HOD maths.Has an uncanny resemblance to the Kenyan cricketer Thomas Odoyo.Most of us believe that he is her son who was lost at the Kumbh Mela.Terrorizes class by randomly asking complex trignometric formulae.  4.Renu Nayyar(Da soporific)-HOD Economics.Has the enviable credentials of being the first teacher to have induced drowsiness in me since the legendary days of Sweezy Madan.  5.Rewa Mahajan(Da Penguin)-the only non-HOD teacher and also last year's classteacher.A highly strict but sincere English teacher,is known for giving astronomically high marks to the deserving and her PJ's. Sample-"Everytime you don't come in school shoes/belt/socks,i will fine you 1 rupee and by the end of the year,I'll be able to buy myself nice Banarasi saris".  I'll say it again though,i am extremely lucky in having them as teachers in my Board year and don't dream of having any others despite their shortcomings

         Shalom.    Presenting the second part of the account of the past days      May 11    In a shocking,heart-attack causing election result,Chandrababu Naidu,India's most popular chief minister,after Narendra Modi of course,was voted out of power in Andhra Pradesh. His party,which had brought international recognition for Hyderabad and Andhra,was logged out of power with a paltry 47 seats out of 294,while the INC+ got 226.Though I had expected them to lose,this huge margin was certainly unexpected.     May 12   Day spent in extreme anxiety due to- a)SAT result after 2 days b)Election results the next day  I was very tense about my SAT result as everybody else who had given it in May hadn't done too well. And here I was ,hoping for a full score in atleast the verbal section.  Sight of the day-Sumanlata suggestively sucking a orange ice cream bar.I won't elaborate ,as being perverts,you will easily be able to guess what I am talking about.Manav ,take note.      May 13    First ,the Chemistry Quiz.   On behalf of Da Owl,yours truly,along with Manav and Anurag ,the 2 Quizzing Club Presidents,were supposed to organize and anchor the inter-section Chemistry Quiz for class 12. The teachers did a wonderful job in making the questions,a perfect blend of studies and trivia,which is what a quiz means to most of the world's inhabitants,barring a few Indians ,of course. I had also roped in Maanick,my nani's brother's wife's nephew,more popularly known as Sir Altitude and President of Unlimited Printouts Club for helping to operate the computers and of course,Siddharth Vyas,our resident Chinese (also known as Mr.Shanghai) for doing hard physical labour. I am an expert at such symbiotic delegation of duties.For both Sir Altitude and Mr.Shanghai,it was an excuse for missing Patalmata,Da Sardar and of course,Da Soporific's test,while for me,it meant having lesser things to do and concentrate on the more important things,namely asking questions.  It was also a day of the election results,so I will present a side by side account of both the results and the event of the day.  7.00 a.m-  We start off with the preliminary written round.20 questions,all quite interesting.  Some samples- a)Which is the only element which contains all the vowels in its name? b)Which beverage was invented by John Pemberton in 1886?  8.00 a.m-  First shock of the day. Bhavya's section fails to qualify,that too on a tiebreaker,that too on the last question ,which was answered correctly by atleast 14 of the 17 sections.Karan and Asgays too were eliminated on the same score of 3.BTW-5 teams were tied at this score. I personally could answer 7 questions  Second shock-My own section (M) qualifies with the highest marks.A pleasant shock,considering that I had to physically force them into taking part.  Third shock(Heart attack causing)-Congress leading in 72 seats,BJP in 15.  8.00 -10.30 a.m  Busy organizing stuff.This included making banners,seeing the questions and of course the election results in the Egurucool Lab. This time was also utilised in renewing contact with our kind and generous librarian,Mrs. Sneh Arora, who let me issue 10 more books after I returned the previous 50.  At 10.30- Congress at 109,BJP at 105.Good fightback  10.30-12.30 The main quiz. The sections which qualified for this were-  12 B-Akshat Vyas's 12 E-Shakti's  12 D-Bharjaiji(Sonali Bajaj)'s  12 I-PC and Gaurav Makhan's 12 K-Cosinetheta's 12 M-Rishabh,Parth and Divye's   There were 10 rounds, 5 general and 5 boring ones dealing with Class 11 syllabus. By a strange quirk of fate,I got to conduct all the boring ones leaving me to face all the brickbats from all the teams.Gaurav Makhan even threatened me with bodily harm. Anyway,we ran out of time and could only do 8 rounds,relief for both me and the audience.  Result- The bio sections B,E,D won in that order,with M narrowly coming fourth.12 I came last.  What a letdown for the quizzing team ,one didn't qualify,other came last.   1.00 pm- Checked result for one last time.  Horrors of horrors                     NDA     - 187                    INC+    - 226  My heart was palpitating at the visualization of Sonia Gandhi as PM. I was plunged into a state of depression for the rest of the day.      May 14     Day of making up past work in the class itself.More importantly,of the SAT result.  I got 1510-One thousand five hundred and ten only.This has been the highest in the school for my batch.  In Verbal ,I got 770-the highest in the world ,while in Maths,my score was 740-a measly 97th percentile.As predicted,my entire family was deeply angry.I had let them down again, something I have been doing throughout high school.     May 15,16    Fiitjee weekend. I was forced to give a treat to everybody in my batch.      May 17    Day the stockmarket suffered its heaviest fall of over 800 points. This is the day,when without telling anybody,I purchased 200 shares Maruti for a meagre Rs.350 each. See,my family has an inexplicable aversion to this share.I have been telling them to buy it for ages,when it was 125,when 242 and when 350 earlier.But each time I was dismissed by saying that it was too expensive.Even on this day,I was forbidden to buy it. Anyway,I still bought it surreptitiously. By the end of the day,it was 410.     May 18   Day Sonia Gandhi declined the post of the PM of India,leaving it for Manmohan Singh.The entire country was shocked,except for me. I had always predicted she would never become PM.  It was sickening to see the sight of hundreds of Congress workers bawling their heads off and threatening to shoot themselves.This just reaffirmed the belief that the Congress is a party of Chaprasis of the Gandhi family.I fail to understand why none of them could not understand this politically astute move by Sonia..In a single stroke,without even crying Vande Mata Rome,she has killed 4 birds with 1 stone.  a)She has gained the respect of the entire country,even of the 65 % who didnt vote for her. b)She has taken the wind out of the opposition's sail,leaving it completely without any issues to raise. c)She has got all the power without any responsibility of being PM. d)She has kept the gaddi safe for her idiotic children,who would never have got a shot at it if she failed to be an effective Prime Minister.  More importantly,the markets bounced back,and I sold my shares for a whopping 444 Rs. each ,a cool profit of 94 Rs. per share .Or Rs.18,800 in all.My parents were very angry when they discovered my transactions,but could not help congratulating me all the same.  This finally makes me a Lakhpati and the richest student of Da Factory.Yay.

                                      VERY SORRY     Shalom.   I am extremely sorry for not blogging for the past 3 weeks.To use cliches,this was due to-   a)I had no  urlLink time .  b)My  urlLink computer  was experiencing some never heard of errors which rendered it impossible for me  to do anything with it. (Exun members note-The IP address mysteriously vanished from  urlLink Network  Connections and repeated attempts to enter a new one completely failed.End result-I had to change form Sify to Hathaway) Since summer  urlLink holidays  are here(finally),I will now find enough  urlLink time  to blog properly.  But first,something which is eagerly awaited(sarcastic laughter),an account of the past days.    April 28,29  Days where I took some much needed  urlLink time  off from  urlLink school  to prepare for the SAT.How I wasted them is another story.    April 30    Day where to my surprise and amazement,we finally got to go to a GSP.The bad  urlLink news  was that we missed the funnest periods,Chem practicals with Da Owl.Also had an appointment with Mamta "Teapot" Sharma,who flatly refused to "counsel" me unless I paid up Rs.200.Another instance of the school's highly devious money-making ways.    May 1    Day I turned sweet sixteen,the busiest birthday of my life. Here's a look at my day- 7.30 a.m- Started from my Noida  urlLink home  for the SAT  urlLink test  venue,USEFI. 9.00-12.30a.m- SAT exam.Went of very well,unlike most others.Left me expecting a perfect score. 1.20 p.m- Reached Fiitjee headquarters in Sarvpriya Vihar. 1.30-5.30 pm- Managed to endure 4 hours of classes.     May 2    Highly exhausted after another 8 hours of Fiitjee,I went into a deep sleep between 6.OO p.m in the evening to 8.00 a.m in the morning.    May 3,4  School  urlLink holidays .Completed mounds of past schoolwork,studied for Monday  urlLink Test  and to my disbelief,managed to solve a lot of Fiitjee questions.    May 5   Day of the third phase of elections,with most exit polls suggesting a hung Parliament. After Monday  urlLink Test ,went to meet Siddhartha Basu to pesent him with a copy of the quizbook manuscript and bully him into  urlLink writing  a preface. Accompanied by one of the zillion Headmistresses of Da Factory,Deepa Raghavan,who incidently hails from the land of Laloo.She and Abhinav got along famously,discovering a lot of mutual  urlLink friends  and relatives.We landed up at his  urlLink office  in East Of Kailash,one of the worst residential places on this planet,only to discover that he was busy in a busyness meeting(misspelling intentional).Spent some  urlLink time  chatting with his wife, Anita Kaul Basu,who happens to be my mother's collegemate from her Miranda  urlLink House  days. Anyway ,he did manage to emerge from his meeting and was quite impressed with the quizbook.He showed us his quizzing  urlLink software  ,which he wanted to sell to  urlLink schools .Quite cool.What was cooler was that his team made questions in the same way as I had done,facing the same  urlLink time  to  urlLink time  problems that I faced with their lingo and structure.So now there is another alternate  urlLink career  just tailormade for me,in case I ever want to take it up.  Ran into another friend of my mother's,Rupin Dang,her classmate at Airforce  urlLink school  and son of the Principal.Also into our quizmasters of the CBSE quiz-Aditya Mubai(a cousin of my favourite teacher from Somerville ,Anita Raina) and Kunal Savarkar. This is indeed a small world.    May 6    Day Da Penguin became berserk,asking us to write both a matrimonial and obituary for her.Was she thinking about dowry deaths?????     May 7     Another day of berserk teachers.At the stroke of Twelve,Da Sardar first gave us a horrible mnemonic-BB ROY Of Great Britain has Very Good Wife,then tells us that it is not right ,as he has yet to meet a wife that is good. He then finished a 2-litre  urlLink water  bottle,and then had the temerity to say-  "Beta,itni choti bottles se mere jaise sardar ka kuch nahin hone wala"  He also managed to convert his  urlLink single  35 minute period with us into hold your breaths,115 minutes of 3 consecutive periods.  This was also where we discovered some new names for Odoyo Ki Maa.While some of them were Black  urlLink Beauty ,O/O form and The  urlLink Horse  Whisperer,the one which we found most apt was, of course,  PATALMATA  .This is due to her completely unique combination of orange  urlLink hair  on black body.Accompanied with her hanging biceps from Babylon,she presents a frightening picture ,reminding one of the rakshasinis of mythology.  Savadhaaan!!Patalmata padhaar rahin hainnnnn!!  Also overheard -Sumanlata discussing her  urlLink holiday  plans for Goa with Vandana Marwah. We already know that she is a national level  urlLink basketball  player,just visualise her playing beach volleyball.    May 8,9    Another Fiitjee weekend.Need I say more?    May 10    Fourth and final phase of polling.Most exit polls predicting that NDA was inching towards halfway mark.

       Shalom.  I have been involved in some serious decision making during the past week. The eternal problem-What do I choose?IIT or abroad?       THE CASE FOR IIT    PRO'S  1.One of the best engineering institutions in the world.Mind you,one of the  best,not the best. 2.Low cost education.(compared to foreign universities) 3.Indianness-will feel more at home than abroad.  CON'S  1.Exam is terribly tough and unpredictable.No guaranteee I will make it. 2.Many IIT's-Kharagpur,Guwahati,Kanpur,situated in midst of nowhere,with almost no interaction with other colleges except for the odd festival. 3.Rigid,inflexible courses.Once you are assigned,say metallurgical engineering,you cant change over to Computer engineering(the better paying one).      The Case for Foreign Universities    PRO'S  1.Flexibility of courses. 2.Much easier to get admission into,what with my superlative academic and extra-curricular record. 3.International exposure,resulting in fuller development. 4.More prestigious and famous.I am talking about the best-MIT,Stanford,Ivy League. 5.Much better infrastructure and living conditions.  CON'S  1.Having just turned 16,I am too young for going abroad. 2.Financial aid uncertain.I can only go if I get a scholarship of 75% or more. 3.Culture shock.   So what do you think I have chosen?? Or should choose??

         Shalom.     After a long wait,the preface for my soon-to-be-published quiz book finally arrived from Siddhartha Basu. With this,it finally goes off for printing.                            Preface    Here’s a quiz book whose time has come - India’s heritage, looked at quizzically by a young enthusiast, fired by a sense of discovery.    As it happens, this was the subject of my very first quiz book, Inquizitive, published way back in 1989. And as I noted then, this is an area where there’s so much more waiting to be discovered, full of questions waiting to be asked, and answered.    Indian heritage can be a slippery area to the seeker of facts. With all the claims and counterclaims of conflicting histories, and disturbing tendencies to prefer myths and legends to proven histories, truth can be a big casualty. And what are facts but truth, and what’s quizzing, if its not about facts ?  So, it’s terrific that Akash Bansal ,an accomplished quizzer on the schools circuit, with a winning track record in heritage quizzing, were prompted by Principal Shyama Chona to write his own quiz book. He waded into the challenge, went beyond the bland over-simplifications of prevailing textbooks, scoured through tomes and volumes in  libraries, and trawled through the net, to come up with a sizeable set of questions, covering various facets of India’s heritage, in a variety of question formats.    Over the years, DPS, RK Puram has earned for itself a reputation for the excellence of its quizzers. Its an outcome of the sort of commendable pro-active support that they’ve extended to the student authors of this book.   This book of questions should whet the appetite of the curious, to find out how much they know, tell them about things they did not know about, test what the book tells them, and encourage them to find out more, for themselves.  In all these years of conducting quizzes, I’ve found that the key to the right answer is the right question. Well, here’s a bunch of probing questions, to set you off on a discovery of India.   Siddhartha Basu New Delhi, 1st June, 2004.
