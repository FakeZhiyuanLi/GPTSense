						    Myster #1 is really easy i think. Email me or post a comment on questions you need to figure this out and i might answer them next week.  &nbsp;  A man was found dead by his sister and her boyfriend. The body was found sitting on the ground obvious shot to the head. A gun was in his hand but his finger was not on the trigger nor was there a burn mark on his head.&nbsp;You are the detective I will give you clue after clue to help you figure it out who's&nbsp;Game??? &nbsp; &nbsp; If you want to play just post a comment and I will start. There will be 3 winners each month. You will receive an online reward which you can post on&nbsp;your blog or a website.   &nbsp;Everyone in&nbsp;the hotel is a suspect:   The Sister: She was mad at&nbsp;her brother for&nbsp;not giving the money he owed her. She needed the money to move.  The&nbsp;Sister's&nbsp;Boyfriend: He&nbsp;wanted the money even worse.&nbsp; He would kill&nbsp;for his girl friend.  Servant: He&nbsp;was&nbsp;the victim’s old business partner.  Girlfriend: She was the daughter of a business owner that the victim ran out of business. &nbsp;   Clues:   The time of death was determined to be 7 hours prior to the finding of the body. This means at 3pm.  There was sweat dripping from him showing had been participating in strenuous activity.  There were no finger prints.  Even though he was said to be dead at 3 pm the girlfriend claimed she saw him at 5 pm.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Alibis:   The Sister was in the shower at the noted time of death.  The boyfriend has an alibi but refuses to share it.  The Servant was in the gym.  The girlfriend was with you talking.  &nbsp;  We will have more clues next week and updated motives alibis.  &nbsp;  P.S. Remember dying right after strenuous activity cause rigor morgues to set in faster than normal.

      Last weekend my post was invited to Emergency Services Weekend. We had a blast yes but here is what happened.     We left the station a little late and everybody was crammed into the vehicles that were gonna take us. I was riding with the cargo, Jodi, Drew, and Jessica D. We had to turn around and go back to the station to get paperwork! So off we went again. This time everything was with us. When we got there we found out the boys were in Kit Carson a cabin, it was o so fun helping the boys find their cabin (Note the sarcasm). When everything was in place in their cabin we headed back to the front of the camp because it was like a mile hike or so.... When the girls got up there you could almost here us moan we were in the cabin nearest theirs. Dan Beard. Now remember we are the devils children us girls we listen to rock  urlLink (JULY FOR KINGS)  and punk, some country, but we are like dark and demented so we hurried and trucked our gear back to our cabin.  The Ladies we were bunking with have not arrived yet and we set up camp.  When they arrived we almost wanted to cry. They had fluffy pink pillows and a Barbie radio. It scared us!  We practically ran out of there. We gain our compotior once again and discussed it. Later that night was awesome though because I got put in team 3! With my team members and a boy that looked like Clay Aiken before his makeover. SCARY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   We were assigned egg buddies. I dropped ours with in 40 minutes and he had severe head trauma that’s all but the said he was dead. YEAH RIGHT! We had a flag that Justin (GIRDLER as I call him) put rainbows on. Oh yes Rainbow pride for Girdler lol...  When we left back for camp we played cards in the cabin. The other girls came back and put on rap but I held my tongue. I tried to go to bed fast as not to offend them with my presence. The next morning we argued and the camp advisor reprimanded us and made us hug. We broke up into our groups and ate. Then the fun began. Compotation! We had tons of fun that day. Muddy obstacle course, skits, whose line, is it anyways? Stuff. We were having the time of our life! That night we went back to camp and we got along fine with the girls except their advisor. At the end of the weekend we had all said goodbye and we drove back to Medcorp.   The post from Bryan,  Ohio came with us to check out our rigs.

The ashes of it all resettle on the ground, Sacred beads picked up and put away, Now can you be found, 'Cause I really want to stay.  I lay crying on my bed, I know remember the words you said, Can it be true are you really dead?  I start to look around, What I've been trying to say, I miss you and I would fall to the ground, For just one more day.   Jessica Renee Cole    So tell me do you guys like it??

This weekend the explorers are going to help out with relay for life. To tell the truth i volenteered so i could watch one of the preps from school fall and hurt themselves! Drew: You did not hear that though.... I swear I'm a good lil girl! *Whatever* Over the last few weeks we have been having fun at meetings. Drew bought this shocking game and let us play it. *Forgive the product placement* You can buy it at spencers. It has a red light that blinks and you hold a button. The light flashes and needs new music! when it turns green you push your button fast. Yes i got shocked a few times cause of my bf. Oh well... I'm just relived the army didn't find the dead body *JK*

      I was thinking a lot about my post lately. Then I was thinking about my friends. What all boils down to is : my post is better then my friends. I realized this after one of my so called friends decided that she wanted to hang out but I wanted one of the post members to come and my friend said no because she doesn't like the group. So I'm not going any where with her! I'm happy to have my post though because I know they would stick up for me. Unlike my friends who would back down and shut up if a prep insulted me. I had to defend myself and with no support to hold me. It was like being on the high dive with no water in the pool.   I love the way the place is run too. Officer meeting, our meeting, break, learning. See it is fun. I just wish some people would understand that a post is more then a few people learning EMS, it becomes you family. That is what I love most of all.

      Dearest readers *if anyone cares*,     I have been face with the realization that I may never ever see my only full blooded brother again except the date of his trial.  He will be held until he's 20 unless there is a plea bargain and I know this system it won't let him stay with us.  He won't get a plea bargain this time.  I may sound cruel at times but right now you can bet anything that as I'm typing I'm crying my eyes out.  I'm so tired I've been up since 9 am  it is now 4:58 am.  I can't sleep.  The god damn law system is taking away my reasons to live one by one god damn them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  As I slowly watch my self esteem disappear I wonder if it's ever gonna get as bad as it did before.  I walked home ever day from 6th grade with a plan to lose my life. Thank god I never carried them out.  I don't know anymore what to do.  If I lose my Explorer Post now I don't know what I'd do.  They have made me a better person and they helped me crawl out of a freaking deep pit of emotion that was taking over my life.  My post captain. Is always there for me, as are all the others.  I'm happy when I'm with them, they don't judge me. I am one weird person. I'm obsessed with anything paranormal including vamps and lycans, I like clay Aiken *yes I admit even though I love rock, his voice calms me down* I'm into rock. Oh yeah I'm pretty strange. I know my brother. He is bi polar and they can't find the right combo of drugs for him so he snaps sometimes. But he can't control it. I love him so much and I'm sitting here looking at his picture of when I went to Columbus to see him after he had his cancer removed. He had a gauze turban on his head because the cancer was a rare cancer and most people acutely don't get it where he did. Thank god they got it before it reached his brain. I need to leave this house and soon cause I can't eat and I can't sleep. My cats keep on looking at me as though they want to know why I'm not playing with them. And my brothers favorite kitten, fuzzy, was looking for Brett. I know because it is the only kitten that can climb steps so far and he was sniffing at anything of Brett's.  At times like this I wonder if god even is there or if he has his head turned away from us because he doesn't want to watch us suffer as he lets the devil go through with it. I just want some sleep. My mom will be waking me up in 1 hour... Oh and for those of you who read my last post I was falling but I just hit the ground and this time I didn't hesitate to run and jump off the next ledge... I just want to know one thing. When is the next time I'll hit the ground????

      Okay i live with my mom and 5 siblings and sam. Today my eldest brother is going to jail for threating my grandmother with a deadly weapon, kicking me twice, and fighting with my brother. I don't know why he does this and it scares me because he gets depressed at times and then he might hurt not just us but himself. I am really crying for him but yet i can't even cry right now because people are around. i can't find my trueself in this world. Where am I?? Who am I? I really can't tell you all i can tell you is that i'm very close to the edge and i'm about to slip. I think i'm already falling but i won't know it till i hit the ground.

      Okay My mom has been married for 10 yrs. I've hated her husband for as long as i've known him. I was only 2 and I hated sombody! I mean hated!! H-A-T-E-D him. he always let his kids (Alex, val, and tato *mikey*) get away with murder but when me or my brother did something wrong like letting our lights on we did something only the devils children did. Do you see why i hate him??? He was cruel to my brother brett since he was little. That is what made brett creul. you know what they say, bite the dog and the dog will learn to bite back. I wanted him out of the house before my mom even sugested it! Any boob can be a parent but only a select few can be fathers. And he was not a father! He is gone now! YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Okay i think you get it. but now there is another man in the house. He is Sam. He is the only man that i would ever consider a father. He is kind and understands. For the short time i've known him he has been the nicest adult male that i've met. I see my mom and she is actully happy. I guess somebody is missing out cause sams ex must have been insane. Sam is a sweetie to my mom and i love it. If he lets me i'd start calling him dad. So mom if your reading this i love you and thank you for finding a sufficent father! oh and here is  urlLink my mommy's blog  read it she'd like it

      Okay i met the stupidest people today! they were wearing all pink, said crudy crap like, "OMG!" "Gag me with a spoon!" and "what ever!" I wanted to tear their judgement heads off and play soccor with them. They called me gothic and a grunge. 1) I am a punk not a goth! 2)grunge my left foot i clean myself daily well on the weekends it's every 2 days so no shower on saturday.... but they judged me before they even tried to get to know me. Oh well why they are dating head football players and sleeping around and ending up on the streets like the football players will, I will be happy as an Emt and i'll probally marry someone in ems as well. Right now i'm happier than the majority of people cause i am excepting a lesson. the lesson is that you shouldn't care about what everbody thinks.
