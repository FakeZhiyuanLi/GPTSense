      PORTUGAL v GREECE MIN-BY-MIN  Final Score: Portugal 0 Greece 1   90 mins: Merk blows for full-time. Greece are champions of Euro 2004 after beating the hosts 1-0 thanks to a goal from Angelos Charisteas. Otto Rehhagel has masterminded the most extraordinary result in international football history, guiding a team who had previously never won a match at a major finals, to one of the biggest prizes in world sport.   90 mins: Portugal get the ball and pass it across the back. Ferreira launches the ball towards Gomes who goes down under Kapsis' challenge but Merk is not interested in free-kick appeals.   90 mins: Zagorakis runs to the corner and draws a free-kick from Valente with a cynicism of which Deco himself would be proud.   90 mins: Greece run down the clock with a series of slowly-taken free-kicks and throw-ins.   90 mins: The set-piece is taken short and finds Deco on the edge of the area but his shot is again blocked.   90 mins: Figo picks his way through the edge of the area, determined to make the difference. A brilliant turn and snapshot wins a left-wing corner.   89 mins: The ball is taken short to Deco and swung to the far post. The offside flag is immediately raised.   88 mins: The game restarts after a lengthy stoppage which will doubtless be reflected in the injury time. Figo makes a powerful run and quick one-two with Gomes. The return ball is intercepted and turned behind for a corner.   87 mins: A man invades the field to launch a protest, running into the Greek goal-netting before being carried away by upto a dozen officials.   86 mins: Kapsis is marking Nuno Gomes closely down the left and the striker is penalised for a hand-ball.   85 mins: Papadopoulos is cautioned for cynically tripping Rui Costa as the veteran tries to launch a counter.   84 mins: Portugal continue to lack any invention whatsoever in midfield.   83 mins: Carvalho's crossfield pass towards Ronaldo is easily intercepted by Seitaridis.   82 mins: Again Portugal stroke the ball around indefinitely on the edge of the area but can find no way through. Rui Costa's pass out to Figo is all too predictably intercepted.   81 mins: Vryzas is replaced by Dimitris Papadopoulos.   80 mins: Ronaldo gets a shooting chance 25 yards out and sees his effort blocked for a corner. The set-piece is palmed away to safety by Nikopolidis.   79 mins: Figo tries to push on but finds Fissas an immovable barrier. He lays off to Ferreira who is tackled by Venetidis. Valente gets a rare crossing chance behind Seitaridis but a poor ball is too close to the keeper.   78 mins: Ferreira crosses from the right but the Greek defence remain impeccably drilled and step out to catch Ronaldo offside.   77 mins: Rui Costa spreads the play right and left but neither he nor Ferreira can make a breakthrough. The veteran is afforded infinite time 25 yards out with Greece preferring to use blanket defending in the area. Eventually the frustrated substitute shoots from 30 yards, lifting a respectable effort over the bar.    76 mins: Stelios Ventidis replaces Giannakopoulos for Greece.   75 mins: A brilliant 50-yard ball from Rui Costa releases Ronaldo into the area on the left and he reaches the ball a fraction ahead of Nikopolidis but can only lift his shot over the bar.   74 mins: Rui Costa twice picks up the ball in a great position 20 yards out but takes too long in possession. This Greek team both deny their opponents space and erode their confidence in one-touch football.   73 mins: Pauleta makes way for Nuno Gomes, Scolari's third and final substitution.   72 mins: Maniche makes a run through midfield and sees a 30-yard shot blocked to Rui Costa. The sub also tries a shot which curls away from goal and wide.   71 mins: Scolari is preparing to bring on Nuno Gomes with the game still drifting away from Portugal's grasp.   70 mins: The set-piece is again cleared first time but Portugal keep up the pressure and Charisteas, back defending, turns the ball behind at the far post for yet another corner. Greece's height advantage continues to tell however and once again they win the first header.   69 mins: The initial set-piece is cleared but the hosts keep possession and Ferreira returns the ball to the area, only a brilliant Dellas interception denies Ronaldo a good chance.   68 mins: Figo swings the free-kick to the far post and Nikopolidis catches easily. Portugal keep up the pressure and it is again Figo, revitalised by the introduction of Rui Costa, who wins a right-wing corner.   67 mins: Figo's set-piece is headed away and the hosts attack again. Figo is the victim of a late tackle from Fissas wide on the right and the Greek is cautioned.   66 mins: Rui Costa continues to excel and excite, nearly poking a ball through to Figo, unmarked on the penalty spot. Portugal keep up the pressure and win a left-wing corner.   65 mins: Zagorakis plays a brilliant ball into Vryzas in the area and Carvalho makes a superb interception on the edge of the area to stop an almost certain second goal.   64 mins: Figo gets the ball off Rui Costa and breaks into the right corner of the area before firing a shot straight at Nikopolidis.   63 mins: Basinas fouls Deco on the Greek left and Seitaridis is cautioned for failing to retreat 10 yards.   62 mins: Rui Costa makes a first impact, breaking into the area from the right wing and offering a good pull-back which Pauleta is inches from converting.   61 mins: Vryzas plays a one-two with Zagorakis before crossing towards the unmarked Charisteas and Maniche is required to make a good block.   60 mins: Manuel Rui Costa replaces Costinha as Scolari looks to change the direction of the European Championship final.   59 mins: Pauleta creates a shooting chance for Ronaldo from 25 yards out and Nikopolidis has to react very quickly to save a fierce drive low to his right.   58 mins: The game restarts. Portugal try to recover their composure with a period of possession in midfield.   57 mins: GOAL CHARISTEAS - Bassinas takes the set-piece, curling it away from Ricardo to the edge of the six-yard box. The goalkeeper is apparently waiting to collect the ball at the far post and Charisteas rises above Costinha to head into an effectively empty net.   56 mins: Zagorakis switches the play and Seitaridis attacks the space to win a right-wing corner from Ronaldo.   55 mins: Portugal continue to dominate possession and Deco gets forward down the left, breaking into the side of the area but dispossessed by a perfect Dellas challenge.   54 mins: Deco revives the axis on which most of Porto's attacking threat was based, picking out the overlapping Ferreira with a 40-yard pass. The full-back is again disappointing, however, scooping a poor cross to the near post for Kapsis to head clear.   53 mins: Portugal continue to enjoy possession in midfield but cannot make a breakthrough.   52 mins: Portugal look to raise the tempo with Ronaldo and Valente both trying to make penetrating runs. They are both rebuffed and Portugal's frustration is evident in Deco's hopeless 35-yard shot which boasts a shape to make Jonny Wilkinson proud.   51 mins: Deco breaks into the right-hand side of the area and goes to ground virtually unchallenged between Katsouranis and Dellas. The Porto midfielder, lucky to avoid a caution in the first half for simulation, is again simply told to get to his feet.   50 mins: Figo gets forward well down the right but a poor cross is too high for Pauleta, again the only red shirt in the area.   49 mins: Seitaridis' long throw is again toothless and Portugal counter. Pauleta finds himself with the ball in the Greek penalty area but there is no support and he is closed down.   48 mins: Charisteas gets away from Valente down the right but Andrade blocks the cross at the near post.   47 mins: Figo, back on the right, tries to get past Fissas and wins a throw. To his disbelief, the veteran is then penalised for a foul throw and Greece have possession once more.   46 mins: Greece keep the ball comfortably with Stelios at the centre of their possession play but a rare error from Seitaridis hands the ball back to Portugal.   45 mins: The second half kicks off.   Half-time: Portugal 0 Greece 0   45 mins: Ronaldo tries to get on the end of Valente's pass and sees it deflected by the hand of Bassinas. The Greek midfielder is cautioned for deliberate hand-ball but the free-kick comes to nothing and the half-time whistle follows. The game has very much gone to plan, specifically Otto Rehhagel's plan. The Greek defence have been characteristically staunch with men crowding Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Figo out of the game and, as against France, they also managed to look the more dangerous team on the break by exploiting the subsequent space. Felipe Scolari has reputation as a flexible tactician on the big occasion and must now justify it if the hosts are to re-assert themselves as favourites.   44 mins: Figo continues to try and get change out of Seitaridis but finds the Greek right-back - who is to replace Chelsea-bound Ferreira at Porto after this tourmanent - is again impressive in snuffing out the danger.   43 mins: Miguel has not recovered from his injury and Paulo Ferreira takes his place at right-back. Ferreira played in the opening game but lost his place to Miguel after making a costly error in Porto.   42 mins: Vryzas gets away down the left and Katsarounis again makes a timely arrival but Carvalho heads away.   41 mins: Dellas launches a high ball forward and Stelios wins the header at the far post, heading across goal and Katsouranis heads wide. A let-off for Portugal.   40 mins: Miguel leaves the field and Figo takes his place at right-back. The switch is only momentary as the Benfica player returns with the ball still in midfield.   39 mins: The game is stopped for treatment to Miguel.   38 mins: Miguel lies injured after an unremarkable tussle with Stelios. The ball eventually finds Pauleta and he tries a 35-yard shot which flies high over the Greek bar.   37 mins: Ronaldo looks to have beaten Seitaridis in the race for a ball down the hosts' left but the Greek's obstruction is rewarded by Merk with a free-kick.   36 mins: Seitaridis' long throw falls to Valente and he clears. Greece are again forced back but take no risks and keep possession in their own half.   35 mins: Vryzas chases the ball in behind Valante and the ever-impressive Andrade races across to cover. Seitaridis will have the chance to launch another long throw-in.   34 mins: Figo curls the set-piece towards Ronaldo at the far post but his delivery is a foot too high and a goal-kick results.   33 mins: Deco wins a free-kick on the corner of the area after a trip from Fissas.   32 mins: Portugal attack with real conviction through Ronaldo and Deco is given the chance to slip in Pauleta for a one-on-one. He slightly underhits the pass, however, and Greece do not allow the slightest margin of error, intercepting to clear.   31 mins: Greece launch another threatening counter, Stelios feeding Angelos Basinas in the middle and a clever early pass releases Vryzas on the left of the area. He lifts a clever cross to the far post but Carvalho heads away.   30 mins: Miguel continues to threaten impressively from full-back but successive crosses are easily blocked and again the danger is cleared.   29 mins: Stelios swings the ball into the middle and Ricardo cannot catch first time but enjoys a little luck in a crowded area and collects it on the bounce.   28 mins: Portugal win a free-kick 20 yards from the goal-line wide on the left after Miguel fouls Stelios.   27 mins: A good run by Charisteas nearly opens up Portugal but he cannot deliver a final ball. It eventually rolls out to Fyssas from Andrade's tackle and the left-back's cross is woeful, easily blocked.   26 mins: Maniche and Figo continue to be at the centre of everything Portugal try but, in truth, little is working. Again Seitaridis leads the Greek defence in harrassing their opponents.   25 mins: The game continues to lack any style by Rehhagel's design. Jorge Andrade is penalised for a foul in midfield and the stop-start nature of the match is yet more obvious when the free-kick is unceremoniously booted into touch down the left.   24 mins: Deco's delivery is better than anything offered from, Figo but Dellas heads away. The ball only gets as far as Maniche and the midfielder has time to line up a shot but drags his effort wide of the left post.   23 mins: Figo, Miguel and Deco combine well down the right and Panagiotis Fissas can only deflect behind for a corner.   22 mins: Deco is once again tripped on the left wing. Greece are again defendng with tremendous spirit.   21 mins: Ronaldo and Maniche keep the ball well on the left and the latter crosses to the far post. The ball clears Pauleta and Miguel arrives strongly at the far post but, with clear lack of communication, the pair collide in trying to strike the ball and a rare half-chance goes awry.   20 mins: Ronaldo, struggling to get into the game thus far, is given the ball from a quick free-kick after a second successive trip on Deco. The winger has ample crossing opportunity on the left but tries one stepover too many and Dellas takes advantage, dispossessing him.   19 mins: Deco is tripped on the left wing.   18 mins: Figo's clever ball releases Miguel down the right but the full-back's cross is poor, blocked at the near post with Pauleta and Maniche waiting in the middle.   17 mins: Pauleta takes a long ball down brilliantly on the left wing and cuts inside but his right-footed, 25-yard shot is easily held by Nikopolidis at the near post.   16 mins: Greece again show that they are excellent in possession themselves, passing the ball through midfield and Charisteas looks set for a one-on-one until Ricardo charges out bravely to block.   15 mins: Figo's corner is again poor, headed away at the near post and the ball is returned to the midfield scrum.   14 mins: After Carvalho, Deco and Maniche all take a touch, it is right-back Miguel who shows how to pierce the Greek defence with a powerful run to the edge of the area, shooting across the face of goal and Nikopolidis needs to get down smartly and turn around the post with a strong right hand.   13 mins: Portugal look to re-assert their authority with a period of midfield possession.   12 mins: The execution of the set-piece is delayed for pushing and, when it is eventually taken, Portugal are immediately awarded a free-kick for a perceived Greek infringement.   11 mins: Seitaridis' throw seeks Zissis Vryzas but is headed away. Greece are forced back but keep possession superbly, eventually releasing Seitaridis on the overlap back down the right and a crude late challenge from Costinha is rightly penalised with a yellow card and free-kick on the corner of the area.   10 mins: Greece make a first serious foray into Portuguese territory and win a throw from Nuno Valente. Giorgos Seitaridis indicates a preference for taking it long.   9 mins: Greece have started as expected, allowing Portugal to make the early running and packing the midfield with players when their opponents have possession.   8 mins: Figo keeps the ball for nearly a minute under pressure from up to five defenders, eventually winning a left-wing corner. The skipper takes it short to Deco and he loses possession but the ball is returned to the area and Nikopolidis has to leave his line smartly to snatch from above the head of Pauleta.   7 mins: Figo tries to make headway down the right but is again crowded out. Maniche wins the loose ball back superbly and switches the play. Ronaldo is tripped in the centre-circle.   6 mins: Dellas intercepts a loose ball as Portugal continue to struggle for space in midfield. His long ball seeks Angelos Charisteas but runs out for a goal-kick.   5 mins: Deco creates a shooting chance for Ronaldo 30 yards out but the Manchester United teenager's shot is charged down by Kapsis. Deco is then penalised for a foul in trying to win the ball back.   4 mins: Pauleta chases a long ball down the right but Antonis Nikopolidis is drawn from his line to intercept, passing the ball calmly to Michalis Kapsis.   3 mins: Pauleta exchanges a one-two with Deco on the edge of the area and looks set to break into the left-hand side of the area until a tackle from Theo Zagorakis. Free-kick appeals are waved away and play continues with Greece in possession.   2 mins: Both sides enjoy spells of pressure but fail to penetrate their opponents' final third in a predictably cagey opening.   1 min: Portugal enjoy early pressure with each of their defenders getting a touch. Deco then launches a ball towards Pauleta but his knockdown is anticipated and intercepted by Traianos Dellas.   0 mins: Referee Markus Merk gets the Euro 2004 final under way with Greece, clad in all white, kicking off.   Pre-match: And we're back where we started. Portugal and Greece, the two teams who kicked off Euro 2004 in the Estadio do Dragao, contest its final in Lisbon's Estadio da Luz this evening. Otto Rehhagel, whose team won 2-1 in that Group A encounter 22 days ago, is forced to make one change from the team that started against Czech Republic in the last four. Georgios Karagounis is suspended for the second time after collecting yellow cards in the quarter- and semi-finals and, as expected, Bolton midfielder Stelios Giannakopoulos takes his place. Rehhagel's opposite number, Felipe Scolari, similarly neglects to spring any surprises as he names the starting XI who lined up against vanquished semi-final opponents Holland, though only six started in Porto on June 12. The burden of expectation will very much weigh on the hosts from the kick-off and it is they who will be expected to attack, the Greeks will most likely look to suffocate their opponents with man markers picking up dangermen Luis Figo, Cristiano Ronaldo and Deco.   Teams Portugal: Ricardo, Miguel, Andrade, Ricardo Carvalho, Nuno Valente, Maniche, Costinha, Ronaldo, Deco, Figo, Pauleta.  Subs: Moreira, Quim, Couto, Beto, Nuno Gomes, Paulo Ferreira, Petit, Postiga, Rui Costa, Rui Jorge, Simao, Tiago. Greece: Nikopolidis, Seitaridis, Kapsis, Dellas, Fissas, Zagorakis, Katsouranis, Basinas, Giannakopoulos, Vryzas, Charisteas.  Subs: Chalkias, Katergiannakis, Dabizas, Georgiadis, Goumas, Kafes, Lakis, Papadopoulos, Tsiartas, Venetidis. Referee: Markus Merk (Germany)
