      I remember John Hurt's character in the film 'The Big Chill'; roughly paraphrasing, he said that for many people its not a question of why to commit suicide but rather its why go on living. I think there's a lot of validity and logic to this approach to suicide. Leaving out the legal, moral, and religious, facets of this issue- one's life dictates whether or not its worth living. Everything in a persons life, EVERYTHING bears on this issue. A persons childhood, career, financial status, health, intelligence, wisdom, ambitions, love, sex, and more things than I can list, directly affects their life and how valuable or worthless they feel or know it is. Of course there are spur of the moment suicides, made without introspection. For example after the wall street collapse of 1929 lots of business men reacted to suddenly being broke or in debt by making the spur of the moment decision to end their lives. Many probably died in good health with a host of good things in their lives still, but the abrupt loss of finances made them see death as a good choice. The sudden impulse to commit suicide is also common for any sudden drastic life affecting adverse occurence. Job loss, death of a close loved one, serious illness, loss of religious faith, loss of someone they loved. In my personal life, I've tried suicide once and thought of it a lot in the last few years. The one serious attempt happened when I was 17 years old. I had been in a serious car crash that had left a man paralyzed, There were a host of mitigating circumstances, as lawyers would probably point out. I was under medication that had made me drowsy, and certainly didn't intentionally cause the car wreck that left the man paralyzed. But the guilt I felt was enough to make me attempt suicide. It was a spur of the moment attempt without enough introspection or weighing of all the issues, but it was a serious attempt made decidely and with sureness. I had taken several dozen maybe a whole bottle of aspirin, maybe 2 bottles I don't remember. I took the pills and went to sleep. But my parents had ordered pizza for dinner and woke me up. Finding myself not dead I went to eat some pizza, feeling woozy and very lightheaded. I ate some but the stomach full of aspirin and the pizza combined to some might say 'miraculously' save my life. I threw up- quite a bit of the pills and pizza, and was later institutionalized after they found out what I had tried to do. I got perspective on my life and the accident and came to realize I didn't need or deserve to die. Years went by, I went to college and developed friends and acquaintances but never found a woman to love who loved me back. Feeling unloved by women can make a man feel lonely but I never felt suicidal. Then one day I met her. She said something no other woman ever said to me 'I love you'. Those are some powerful words by anyone's definition- to me they were the most powerful words I'd ever heard. To know that someone loves you is perhaps the most powerful feeling in all existence.  Then to lose that 'love' must be one of the most damning. To be forthright she never said 'I don't love you' to me. But having to know I did ask her as she was walking out the door something to this effect question... 'All those times I said I love you and you said you loved me too...Did you mean it?' The long pause...Her silhouette framed in the doorway and then the slow deliberate response 'I tried to mean it.' A statement of that magnitude could only mean one thing I was never loved by her. She 'tried' to love me...Like someone who goes through the motions and even says the words but doesn't mean or feel them, what does it mean? Does it matter? I've longed for my wife, my friend, my Barbara for over 2 years now but perhaps it was all just a gigantic lie...No I loved her soul wrenchingly and to the point of death itself I loved and still love 'my Barbara' if she ever truly existed. But today's Barbara resembles 'my Barbara' of yesteryear, in appearance only. A Doppleganger, a creature of mythology that replaces another person, one who resembles them but who's personality values and mind all seem totally alien and destructive. That's a way I have often thought of the new Barbara. But even that image failed to explain everything to my heart and mind. The best way I can think of her today is that she the new Barbara is a totally alien creature, one who has supplanted perhaps more rightfully thought, murdered my Barbara, because the new Barbara has little resemblance to the old.

      Shakespear coined the phrase, oh so long ago, 'To be or not to be, that is the question. Whether tis nobler etc etc etc.' And of course thru the centuries, perhaps through millenia man has struggled with the question 'Is my life worth living?' Well this blog is (trumpet fanfare) an examination of my life- in which I will work on answering this question, for myself, and I guess for you readers. Oh yes, there are probably millions of people who's lives are 'worse' than mine, people suffering from Cancer, AIDS, arthritis and a myriad of other painful illnesses. Millions more may be reading my blogs saying 'So what?' Whats the big deal? Why is this guy whining? To badly paraphrase Descartes 'I whine therefore I am.'
