      There was a certain man of Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham son of Elihu son of Tohu son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.  He had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.  Now this man used to go up year by year from his town to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests of the LORD.  On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters;  but to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the LORD had closed her womb.  Her rival used to provoke her severely, to irritate her, because the LORD had closed her womb.  So it went on year by year; as often as she went up to the house of the LORD, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat.  Her husband Elkanah said to her, "Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?"  After they had eaten and drunk at Shiloh, Hannah rose and presented herself before the LORD. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the LORD.  She was deeply distressed and prayed to the LORD, and wept bitterly.  She made this vow: "O LORD of hosts, if only you will look on the misery of your servant, and remember me, and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a male child, then I will set him before you as a nazirite until the day of his death. He shall drink neither wine nor intoxicants, and no razor shall touch his head."  As she continued praying before the LORD, Eli observed her mouth.  Hannah was praying silently; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli thought she was drunk.  So Eli said to her, "How long will you make a drunken spectacle of yourself? Put away your wine."  But Hannah answered, "No, my lord, I am a woman deeply troubled; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the LORD.  Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation all this time."  Then Eli answered, "Go in peace; the God of Israel grant the petition you have made to him."  And she said, "Let your servant find favor in your sight." Then the woman went to her quarters, ate and drank with her husband, and her countenance was sad no longer.  They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD; then they went back to their house at Ramah. Elkanah knew his wife Hannah, and the LORD remembered her.  In due time Hannah conceived and bore a son. She named him Samuel, for she said, "I have asked him of the LORD."  The man Elkanah and all his household went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and to pay his vow.  But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, "As soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him, that he may appear in the presence of the LORD, and remain there forever; I will offer him as a nazirite for all time."  Her husband Elkanah said to her, "Do what seems best to you, wait until you have weaned him; only-- may the LORD establish his word." So the woman remained and nursed her son, until she weaned him.  When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine. She brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh; and the child was young.  Then they slaughtered the bull, and they brought the child to Eli.  And she said, "Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the LORD.  For this child I prayed; and the LORD has granted me the petition that I made to him.  Therefore I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he lives, he is given to the LORD." She left him there for the LORD.  Hannah prayed and said, "My heart exults in the LORD; my strength is exalted in my God. My mouth derides my enemies, because I rejoice in my victory.  "There is no Holy One like the LORD, no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God.  Talk no more so very proudly, let not arrogance come from your mouth; for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.  The bows of the mighty are broken, but the feeble gird on strength.  Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, but those who were hungry are fat with spoil. The barren has borne seven, but she who has many children is forlorn.  The LORD kills and brings to life; he brings down to Sheol and raises up.  The LORD makes poor and makes rich; he brings low, he also exalts.  He raises up the poor from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap, to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor. For the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and on them he has set the world.  "He will guard the feet of his faithful ones, but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness; for not by might does one prevail.  The LORD! His adversaries shall be shattered; the Most High will thunder in heaven. The LORD will judge the ends of the earth; he will give strength to his king, and exalt the power of his anointed." ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~          God seems to have a history of closing wombs and forgetting about women, then miraculously remembering them.  First we had Sarah, then Rebekah, and Rachel, and now Hannah.  Except this time it seems God had some help in remembering—maybe God got a remembrel—you know, in Harry Potter they’re those glass orbs that get red smoke in them when you’ve forgotten something…and God finally remembered what it was God was forgetting—Hannah!            Who sent this remembrel?  Hannah, of course….but why?  Why was it so important that Hannah not be forgotten?  Well, for starters, her husband’s other wife, Peninnah, was mean.  Can’t you just hear her calling Hannah names and mocking her—“o barren one” , “dry well” , “worthless wife…” , “hey, Hannah, your oven is off” …. She was irritating, she was mean, and she caused some serious depression.  It doesn’t take long for this kind of verbal abuse to become a part of you—something you believe, something that you won’t talk back to or stand up against because you secretly wonder if it’s right and you don’t deserve to be called a person.  That’s what Peninnah was doing—in this story she represents the whole ancient society, telling Hannah that she is worthless, that she is not a whole person (or even a person at all) because she isn’t like everyone else, her experience is different, she’s not useful to her husband…for she has borne no children.  In this story, Hannah never talked back to Peninnah—perhaps she didn’t have the strength or the will, perhaps she didn’t have the heart, perhaps she didn’t have the self-esteem.  In any case, Peninnah continued her abuse year after year.             Hannah’s husband, Elkanah, doesn’t seem to be much better.  Sure, he loves her in spite of her barrenness, he even gives her a double portion at the time of the yearly sacrifice—but he isn’t terribly sensitive.  If he has to ask why Hannah is sad, why she cries, and why she won’t eat, then he’s not paying a lot of attention to his family dynamics.  Then he asks the problematic question:  “Am I not more to you than ten sons?”  Translation for modern readers:  “Can’t I be enough for you?”   Hannah can’t answer this question.             Maybe people read this as a loving question—Elkanah loved Hannah even though she didn’t have any children.  Others, however, might point out that perhaps it is one of those moments—you know the ones, when you think you’re saying the right thing but you really, aren’t—insinuating that he alone could change the eyes of society and give her personhood, as if he alone could simply remove all the expectations and judgments of the community from her.  A barren woman in those days was of no worth, and everyone knew it.  Besides, it would be easy for him to say, since he already has children to be his heirs.  It’s not like he needs Hannah’s children to carry on his family line, and her children wouldn’t be among his firstborn anyway, because Peninnah’s several children have snatched up the biggest portions of any inheritance.            But Hannah doesn’t answer her husband’s question.  She remains completely silent.  She is depressed, she has lost her appetite and her voice.  So she does the only thing she can—she goes into the house of the LORD and prays.  She makes a deal:  “God, if you’ll remember me and give me a son, I’ll give him right back to you.”  She doesn’t seem to want the child for herself or her husband—she doesn’t want him to have around the house or the farm, to be a comfort or help, or to carry on the family line.  The most important thing for Hannah is not to have the child with her, it’s to have the child. So she bargains, and she is fervent in her prayer.  Only the most desperate woman in the most desperate situation could make this prayer, with this promise to God that she’d give up the child she so longed for.  That kind of desperation led her to a make a desperate deal.            However, as she made this prayer, Hannah wasn’t speaking out loud.  She was just property, she wasn’t worth much, and she had probably so internalized Peninnah’s abuse that she didn’t have a voice to speak with anymore—she had been silenced by her community, as so many people still are. Unfortunately Eli, the priest, thought she was drunk because she was moving her lips without making a sound.  He confronted her about making a spectacle of herself there, in the Temple of the LORD.  He essentially confirmed her worthlessness and demanded that she leave behind her sinfulness.  But Hannah has finally had the last straw:  she finds her voice and defends herself to this priest, to this man of God who is supposed to see everyone as God’s child and servant, this one person who shouldn’t think the worst of her but apparently does anyway.  “Do not consider me a worthless woman!!!” she says.  She has at long last stood up for herself and contradicted what everyone has been thinking.  She has been continuously silenced by a community that considers her worthless, by Peninnah who abuses and insults her, and now the priest is impugning her integrity too!  Hannah does NOT stand for this.  “Do not consider me a worthless woman.  I have been praying this whole time, in great anxiety and distress.”  Hannah is silent no more.            Eli was probably shocked that this woman, this worthless woman, had talked back to him.  How dare she?  He was also, hopefully, upset with himself for not being able to tell the difference between prayer and drunken stupor.  But he doesn’t show any of this…instead he takes his words back.  He then assures her that God will hear her prayer and grant her request, and Hannah goes away, she eats again, she drinks again, and, most importantly, her “countenance was sad no longer.”             Hannah has now talked to God silently, and to Eli out loud, and now she has all kinds of self-esteem growing in her.  God remembers her at long last, and she has a baby.  While the boy is still unweaned, it’s time for the yearly trip to Shiloh.  The whole family is going, but Hannah speaks to her husband for the first time in this whole story and says, “no, I’m not going.  I’ll come later, and guess what?  I have to leave the boy there.”  Not only has Hannah found her voice, but she’s found her willpower and her spunk, too!            Now, at this point, you would expect that Elkanah would say, “umm, excuse me, but technically, according to socio-political family system rules of our age, that child is mine and I get to make the decisions.  I already let you choose his silly name….what do you mean you’re going to leave a boy, someone who could be really useful on the farm, at the temple?  I don’t think so, and if you do I’ll get rid of you AND bring the boy home.”  But he doesn’t.  Instead he says, “do what seems good to you.  May the LORD establish his word.”   Umm…this isn’t exactly normal.  Men of this time period are supposed to be in charge.  Men of this time period are the heads of households and the women are property, not the decision makers.  Men are strong and women follow.  But apparently not in this case, for Elkanah, the one who only a year ago asked “am I not more to you than ten sons,” finally understands Hannah, and what she needs. So, Elkanah and the whole family pile into the minivan and leave, and Hannah and Samuel stay behind.             Once the two of them do go up to Shiloh, Hannah sees Eli and rushes over to him to tell him the news… “I was the one here a year ago, and this was what I prayed for (she says, pointing at the child in her arms), and look, I got it!  So now I’m giving him to the LORD, which means you get to take care of him here.  Have fun, and be nice to him, and may he be God’s servant forever.  Bye!”  Is this really the woman whose lips were moving but whose voice was silent just one year ago?  What happened?  Her newfound voice is startling and amazing.  Well, she did have the baby she asked for.  And not only that, but this baby is not just like any other baby.  This child is Samuel, who will become one of Israel’s greatest prophets, the prophet who speaks directly with God and anoints kings.  God has not only given Hannah a child, but has placed her in the line of Israel’s matriarchs.  She is essential to Israel’s life and continued story.  She is God’s chosen one, who brings a bearer of God’s message into the world.             And so she goes into the temple and prays.  Last time Hannah was fervent but silent.  Now she still prays fervently, but she prays to God out loud, she praises in a loud voice, and she goes on for quite some time.  The song she sings as her prayer is remarkably similar to a psalm that is used at the time of the Passover festival, and extols God for God’s amazing power and justice.  God has lifted up the lowly and brought down the mighty….God has lifted up Hannah from her despair and depression, and has thwarted the insults and abuse of Peninnah, society, and the priest.  God has opened Hannah’s eyes to her full humanity—and now (in the eyes of the world) Hannah is as worthy as any other woman.  There is no ground for the community’s view of her any longer, and that has turned the world on its head….God is the only Rock, and God is the one who gives, and God is the one who judges, for the whole earth, and indeed the pillars on which the earth rests, are Gods.  Peninnah doesn’t have anyone to make fun of anymore…indeed Hannah nearly addresses her directly:  “talk no more so very proudly, let not arrogance come from your mouth….” Because no longer is Peninnah able to consider herself better than Hannah.  No longer is Hannah the utter bottom of the food chain in the family, a non-person.  The society has no more mean names to call Hannah.  Eli can’t say she’s a worthless drunken woman anymore.  God has made her aware of her wholeness.  She is not only a mother, but the mother of a prophet, and thus a crucial character in Israel’s story.  No wonder, thousands of years later, Mary used the same words to praise the God who made her a central figure in the same story.  And now not only is Hannah lifted up, but Hannah’s voice is lifted up.  In the beginning of the story, she was silent, but now she raises her voice for the heavens and the earth to hear—she speaks up at long last.  And she uses her voice to say “this child isn’t what’s important—and I’m going to give the boy back to God, who is The Holy One who breaks molds, does new things, and reverses injustice in the world.”            It seems that Hannah’s is an early story of women’s rights, of women’s voices and authority in the home and out of it too.  This is a story voiceless women, and indeed all people, can plug in to, a part of the story of God’s community that we can all find our voices in.            Some of you may be wondering “how can I find my voice in a story about a woman who can’t have children?”  Our society today doesn’t place such a strong emphasis on children as anyone’s only path to worthiness, thankfully.  Hannah’s story is not just about the child, though.  It’s also about judgment and worth.  Yes, the ancient community judged women by their child-bearing ability.  Later, the medieval community judged people on their piety.  And now our modern community often judges us on our education, our car, the church we belong to, the clothes we wear.  We, like Hannah, may not be able to find our own voices to speak up against these judgments.  But, also like Hannah, God shows us our full humanity, and opens our eyes to our worth as God’s children.  Our worthiness lies, not in the expectations of society, but in our identity as God’s beloved, God’s chosen people.  And so, like Hannah, we must raise our voices for earth and heaven to hear, speaking up for ourselves and others, and exulting in the Holy One, beside whom there is no other.

                  As he was setting out on a journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”  Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good?  No one is good but God alone.  You know the commandments:  You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness, you shall not defraud, honor your father and mother.”  He said to him, “Teacher, I have kept all these since my youth.”  Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said, “you lack one thing.  Go, sell what you own, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.”  When he heard this, he was shocked and went away grieving, for he had many possessions.              Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!”  And the disciples were perplexed at these words. But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!  It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”  They were greatly astounded at this and said to one another, “Then who can be saved?”  Jesus looked at them and said, “For mortals it is impossible, but not for God; for God, all things are possible.”             Peter began to say to him, “Look, we have left everything and followed you!”  Jesus said to him, “Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields, for my sake and for the sake of the good news, who will not receive a hundredfold now in this age—houses, brothers and sisters, mothers and children, and fields, with persecutions—and in the age to come eternal life.  But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first. ~~~The Gospel of the Lord.  Praise to you, Lord Jesus!~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~             Don’t we all love this text?  I mean, really.  Preachers are so fond of it, because we get to tell people that it’s really important to give us your money.  In fact, this text is exactly the kind of thing I often call the “shakedown”:  in the church we hear it as the offering sentences, the stewardship season, the capital campaign….              Or, alternatively, there is the “don’t worry, he wasn’t serious” tack that I heard the first time I heard this text preached on.  I was in high school, not a church-goer, and I was hired to play clarinet with the handbell choir of a local Presbyterian church—the one known for the wealth of its members.  This was the text of the day, and the first line of the sermon—the only one I remember, actually—was “don’t worry, you don’t have to sell your fancy cars and give away all your money.”  You can imagine the effect that kind of contradiction would have on a highly literal, unchurched, lower-but-rising-middle class teenager. I talked bad about Presbyterians for several years after that.                Well, now I’m here, and I’m as frustrated as all of you with the constant talk of camels really being thick yarn, and the needle really being a gate, so that the contradiction that Jesus mentions here is lost.  I think we spend a lot of time talking about the language Jesus uses, and not enough time talking about the thing he’s trying to say.  I’m sure we could argue for days about what he’s really trying to say, but I only have about 14 minutes left so we won’t.  Instead we’re going to leave the camel question behind for a bit and talk about people.              Imagine with me that you are this man.  You’ve just run a long way, maybe from the next town, to ask Jesus this question.  You know the commandments, and you’ve followed them, but there’s still something missing—you just don’t know what it is.  Jesus first points out that you can’t ascribe God’s goodness to him, then tells you to follow the commandments, obviously.  You explain that you’ve always been very good, very righteous, very law abiding. … And Jesus loves you! … But then he tells you something you really don’t want to hear:  sell everything you own, give away the money, and come wander with him.  “Excuse me, what?”  You think.  Sell everything?  Follow…where?  You go away very sad.              What is it about selling your stuff that would be so awful?  Is it that everyone associates wealth with God’s blessing?  Is it that a loss of social status would change who you are?  What is it?  Well, I know what would be awful for me:  I like most of my stuff.  I’m always telling people I have too much stuff, and I do.  But I do have some things that I am not able to part with…like my clarinet, for instance.  I haven’t played in over a year, and there’s a beautiful, high quality professional clarinet in my closet.  But would I sell it even if Jesus told me to?  Probably not.  Sure, I’m willing to entertain the notion—I often do, for about 12 seconds—but follow through?  I don’t think so.               Well, Peter points out that he and his fellow disciples have done exactly that.  Well, they left everything, anyway, though it’s not clear that they necessarily sold everything.  I often see myself as Peter in the gospel story—he gets it, then really really doesn’t…he’s just so human.  It’s probably a little easier to imagine yourself as Peter, so let’s take another trip to the land of make-believe for a moment.               You’re packing for a journey—well, as much as you’re allowed to pack: your toothbrush, some sunglasses…Bartholomew gets caught trying to sneak an extra shirt for the trip so you’re all running late…and you’re finally walking out the door when yet another random person comes running up to Jesus insisting that he is asking the most important question of the century.               You overhear some of the conversation…Jesus telling him to follow the commandments—well, most of those were commandments, anyway—and then you hear the man claim to have followed them all.  Huh?  Who has followed all the commandments their whole lives?  This guy must not have seen a priest lately, so he just doesn’t know that he’s broken them.  Wait, wait, Jesus is talking again… Sell all your stuff and come follow me?  Wha..why…huh?  Well, I guess that’s what we’ve all done.  Hey Jesus, guess what?  We must have it right for a change because we’ve left everything to follow you.  Excuse me, what?  Wait….are you talking in riddles again?  Yes I said riddles, not parables, riddles.  Have you ever seen a camel?  Those things are huge!  No way.  Wait, you’re already walking, but, hey Andrew, did he confirm that we got it right in leaving our homes and following him?  Hello?  Jesus?               Let me just tell you, this is how I feel most of the time.  “Look Jesus, I’m doing something right for a change!”  “Hey, I already do what you told that person, so that must be the magic formula that will get me in, right?”  The difference between Peter and the random man is that Peter thinks he’s got it, and the man thinks he doesn’t.  The man asks a question, and Peter makes a declaration.  But there is also something similar about the two.              Did you hear the man?  “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”  And Peter, “look, we’ve got it right, yeah, the 12 of us, over here!”  So really, neither of them is right, for they are both thinking in terms of themselves, and in terms of what they think they are supposed to be doing.  Jesus is challenging them to think in new ways—and the only way he can do that is through their own experience.  God meets us where we are—and for the man, where he is is with himself and with money.  And for Peter, where he is is with getting it right and with himself.  However, Jesus’ answers to the man and to Peter point out that though God meets us where we are, God doesn’t necessarily want us to stay where we are.  Instead, as Bonhoeffer says, God is often calling us to rethink our own paradigms.  Maybe it’s not about following the commandments to the letter.  Maybe it’s not about doing what was recommended for someone else.  Maybe it’s not about being wrapped up in ourselves and the way we think the world should be.  But maybe it all starts with asking the question…just as the man asks the question.  Unfortunately for him, he couldn’t rethink his paradigm, his worldview, his entire frame of reference, without a very drastic change—or at least the suggestion of one.               What about Peter?  Good old Peter, the epitome of humanity in relation to Jesus.  What does he get in response to his declaration?  “That’s right, and don’t worry, you’ll get your reward.  But … the first will be last, and the last first.”  That doesn’t sound like a reward, does it?  It sounds like the disciples will be last into the kingdom because they were first in following Jesus.               Maybe this is just the suggestion Peter needs.  He sees that he and his newfound friends follow Jesus, they seem to do everything that’s required of them, they believe…Peter even declared that Jesus is the Messiah just two short chapters ago.  They are the ones who get it, not the Pharisees, not the women at wells, not the children…and certainly not this rich man.  Peter sees himself as already well on the way to completing the requirements he thinks Jesus has laid out for everyone.  He is caught up in this worldview, this paradigm, where those who get it right are the ones who get in...but it’s clear that his own view of what is right is definitive.  Jesus keeps telling him, and keeps telling him, and keeps telling him, and finally this time comes right to the heart of the matter:  “sure, you’re right,” he says, “but many who are first will be last and the last will be first.”   Because it’s not about your vision of right.  Because it’s not about when you started following me.  It’s not about how perfectly you follow me.  It’s not about how you see yourself.  What’s more important to me is the simple fact that you do follow; the simple fact that I can and do love you even when you don’t get it; the simple fact that I called you and all these other people too.               Anthony DeMello was a Jesuit priest in India.  He wrote several collections of wisdom stories, most about a “Master”, who is a leader, a guru, if you will…sometimes Christian, sometimes Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim…or any variety of things…  He has a story about a Master who was “exceedingly gracious to university officials and professors who visited him, but he refused to be drawn into their theological speculations or to answer their religious questions. HisThe disciples were amazed by this and asked him about it.  He answered them:  how can one talk of the ocean to a frog in a well?  Or about the divine to those restricted by their concepts?”  This story describes so well what I see here, on so many levels.  The man is restricted by his wealth, or at least by its possession of him, and by his worldview that defines what is good, what it means to be a disciple, and what it means to have eternal life.  Peter is restricted by his worldview too…of right and wrong, of first and last.  And often we are restricted by the image of the camel and needle, the idea that wealth is necessarily a bad thing because Jesus tells this one man to give it all up, the concept of stewardship as being about money and not necessarily about time, talents, or service.  It’s hard to break out of our paradigms, to rethink our worldviews, to think about the ocean when we have only lived in a well.              Thankfully, though, there is the line Peter may very well have overlooked and the rich man didn’t even hear:  “For mortals it is impossible, but not for God.  For God, all things are possible.”  For mortals it is impossible to be perfect.  For mortals, it is impossible to get it right.  For mortals, it is impossible to enter the kingdom of heaven of one’s own volition.  But not for God.  For God, all things are possible.  It is possible for God to forgive us when we are not perfect, to correct us when we get it wrong or when we think we’ve got it right, to bring us close to God in the church, in the sacraments, in Scripture, through the Holy Spirit, and in one another.  It is possible for God to call us, and to help us respond.  And through God it is possible for us to rethink the paradigms we live in and to reshape the world around us.  This is the key point that both Peter and the rich man are missing.  They are missing that for God, and therefore for us with God’s help, it is possible to do all kinds of new things.              Do we have any starting points for this rethinking of our paradigms?  Why should we rethink our worldview and try to figure out a new way?  Isaiah tells us.  In the old way, there was self-righteous fasting, sackcloth and ashes, worthless sacrifices, and confusion about God’s distance from us.  The place God wants us to start is this:  “is not this the fast that I choose:  to loose the bonds of injustice, to let the oppressed go free, to share your bread with the hungry, bring the homeless poor into your house, and cover the naked?”  The list goes on…and what is the result?  Our light shall break forth like the dawn.  Our healing shall spring up quickly.  The glory of the Lord shall be revealed to us.  We shall call, and God will answer us saying “Here I am!”  What better place to start than the place God has given us?              We know that Peter eventually gets it and begins to rethink his own worldview.  His storyline continues, and tells us that it took him several more tries, including denying Jesus, including watching his friend and mentor die a horrible death, and including a worldview-shattering experience of that friend and mentor resurrected from the dead.  But those several tries eventually led him to become a leader in the church, the first apostle to preach, the apostle who is the rock in our cloud of witnesses.                      But what do we think happens to the man after he goes away grieving?  Does he think and pray about it, and sell all his possessions, give the money to the poor, bank on that treasure in heaven, and go wander around with Jesus?  Or does he maybe keep his possessions but stop letting them possess him—do they become less important to him, and he is thereby freed to serve others, as his form of following Christ?  Or, the least attractive option to us readers…does he simply go away and decide that Jesus was bitter that day—jealous of his wealth, status and comfortable life—and continue living his life as before, following the commandments to the letter but missing the spirit of the law?  Does he continue to be wrapped up in himself and his own chances at eternal life, or does he decide to look away from himself and see the good he can do to those around him?  Your imaginations have to provide the end of the story.  But, depending on the ending you choose, it may be just a beginning.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.

      This is the first sermon I ever preached, in preaching class in the spring of 2003.   Acts 8.26-40  Then an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “get up and go at noon to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.”  (This is a wilderness road.)  So he got up and went.  Now there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of the Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, in charge of her entire treasury.  He had come to Jerusalem to worship and was returning home; seated in his chariot he was reading the prophet Isaiah.  Then the Spirit said to Philip, “Go over to this chariot and join it.”  So Philip ran up to it and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah.  He asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?”  He replied, “How can I, unless someone guides me?”  And he invited Philip to get in and sit beside him.  Now the passage of the scripture that he was reading was this: “Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter, and like a lamb silent before its shearer, so he does not open his mouth.  In his humiliation justice was denied him.  Who can describe his generation?  For his life is taken away from the earth.” The eunuch said to Philip, “About whom, may I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?”  Then Philip began to speak, and starting with this scripture, he proclaimed to him the good news about Jesus.  As they were going along the road, they came to some water; and the eunuch said, “Look, here is water!  What is to prevent me from being baptized?”  He commanded the chariot to stop, and both of them, Philip and the eunuch, went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.  When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing.  But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he was passing through the region, he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.  This is the word of the Lord.  Thanks be to God.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~            Near the university where I studied is an organization, not related to the school, called University Bible Fellowship.  People from there wander about in the neighborhood, looking lost, asking the time, etc, and poor unsuspecting people like me, always willing to lend a hand, will talk to them.  Within minutes they have discovered your name and invited you to one-on-one Bible Study with them.  My freshman year of college I must have met ten of these people—the only one I remember was a man named Gideon.  In the space of less than five minutes, I had declined and yet somehow given him my telephone number and the name of the dorm I lived in.  I know, I know….dumb freshman, etc…I didn’t answer my phone for 6 weeks at least.  I screened my calls through voicemail, which isn’t terribly effective but it worked for a while.  He either never called or never left a message—I don’t know which.  That’s ok, though! I always rejoiced when they finally went away.  These people were worse than any other itinerant evangelists, because you never knew who would be One Of Them.  More than once I was late to class because I’d been accosted by someone from University Bible Fellowship.  I felt like they were invading my space, being disrespectful of my belief system that they knew nothing about (neither did I, but that’s beside the point…), and besides they were just generally annoying.  My coming to the church was somewhat delayed because of this experience, as I’m sure you can imagine.  And once I was in the organized church, I was very wary of sharing my faith with others, because I didn’t want to be like the University Bible Fellowship people, or like the person on the train that you avoid at all cost because you can see that they are trying to evangelize, or like the girl in your science class who uses question periods as a time to proclaim Creationism over Evolution.  Besides that, I was afraid.  What would happen?  What would people think of me?  What would the reactions be?  And who was I to share the good news, anyway—a random, young, female college student, new to the church, and generally unworthy.                       Why is sharing our faith with others so scary?  Why is the stereotype one of insensitivity?  Philip seems to be pretty comfortable.  He wasn’t one of the original 12 disciples, he was probably a diaspora-Jew-turned Christian, and given the age of the church at this time (just a few months after Pentecost) he wasn’t exactly an established member.  He was one of the seven chosen to take food to the widows—that’s not so hard, most of us can do that.  He went around in Samaria preaching.  Well, we’re a class full of future preachers, and we should probably get used to preaching in slightly less-than-friendly situations—after all, the church is not exactly a friendly place to people who simply tell it like they see it right now (from any side of any debate, really)—so many people claim that the church just needs to maintain the status quo.  That’s obviously not what Philip did, because now he’s wandering around talking to gentiles, which was uncomfortable to many who wanted Judaism maintained within this new sect.  Just imagine for a moment with me that you’re in this scene.             You’re walking along one mid-July morning, having a good time, chatting with some new friends, when one of them says to you, “hey, it’s high noon!  I think you should walk around the hill country of Texas by yourself today.”  You think, “Are you crazy?  Heat, wilderness, noon, alone…what part of that sounds like a personal safety program?”  You know it’s crazy, but you go anyway—you’re always up for a little fear-factor-esque adventure.  It’s really hot, and you forgot your hat, and you only have one bottle of water.  Up ahead you see a caravan of limos.  Obviously someone important, plenty of security, it’s probably best to keep back a bit so you don’t get arrested, shot, or just taken into custody for no reason and sold into slavery without a chance to call home first.  After all, you don’t exactly look like everyone else down here.  Then it hits.  The call.  The one that changes everything.  You don’t know why this is happening, your family doesn’t understand, your friends claim they were joking, but you go.  You run up to the limos.  You see the secret service guns trained on you and the cars come to a halt.  All in a split second, you hear a voice reading your favorite prophet and you ask through the window if the person understands.  You can hardly believe you are talking out loud, but it’s too late now.  You look inside, and Alan Greenspan is using this half a moment to think of his status, his ego, his appearances, the press, and the humility brought on by reading something incomprehensible.  And, like magic, he confesses his need, opens the door, and scoots over to make room for you. “Now I’m in for it,” you think.  You’re in a limo with the man who controls our economy, and you have no idea what’s going on.  He asks a question, you begin to speak, and amazingly, the Spirit gives you the words.  An outsider would probably see a tongue of fire dancing over your head.  All you had to do by yourself was follow the call and ask a question.             The catch, of course, is that it wasn’t easy.  It’s hot out there, it’s the wilderness.  The risk taken in approaching the limo is not exactly negligible.  Why do it?  Well, there’s that whole thing where Jesus tells us to go, baptize, proclaim, etc.  If that isn’t convincing enough, there’s also the Book of Order, which states that the First of the six Great Ends of the Church is “the proclamation of the gospel for the salvation of humankind.”              Does that mean we have to be Jehovah’s witness-like evangelists, knocking on doors, or like the University Bible Fellowship, accosting people with one-on-one Bible Study opportunities?  Not exactly.  Many of us probably don’t normally invite the Jehovah’s witness into our home for tea.            Proclaiming the gospel doesn’t have to be hard, scary, or insensitive.  As Christians our duty is to live the gospel, to proclaim it with our lives as well as our words.  Sometimes all it takes is asking the question, being with someone, or responding a certain way to a situation. But sometimes it is hard, sometimes we have to put ourselves on the line.  Embodying the gospel happens in so many ways, and anyway Jesus never seemed to worry about his personal safety program.  That’s why there are people protesting every afternoon on Columbia Drive—they are using their bodies AND their words to proclaim what they see in the gospel.  That’s why there are people tutoring children every day after school, visiting kids in the projects and taking them out of that environment for day trips so they can see their potential, reading textbooks onto tapes for disabled students, volunteering at the Central Night Shelter.  Sure, it can be dangerous—sometimes bodily, sometimes to our ego, our self-image, our public image, or at least our self-righteousness.  It’s a wilderness road, at noon, and someone is waiting in that chariot just ahead.             As Christians, and as pastors, our duty is to lead people in the wilderness to water, and enable those people to do the same for others.  When Philip and the eunuch came up out of the water and Philip suddenly disappeared, the eunuch could have thought, “that was a nice dip on a hot afternoon,” or maybe, “great, I’m dripping, people are staring, and that guy is gone.  What now?”  But he went on his way rejoicing—like the benediction says, we are to go on our way rejoicing in the power of the Spirit….this is not the rejoicing I was doing when the UBF people finally left me.  Meanwhile, Philip was suddenly relocated!  He doesn’t appear to miss a beat—he proclaims the gospel at all times.  We can do that too.  Though we are, of course, to live the gospel in our daily lives, it is when we proclaim the gospel in all its fullness that we are most vulnerable, and most supported by the Spirit.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.
